Eight performers remained hospitalized Monday after a platform collapsed during a performance by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Providence, Rhode Island on Sunday . After the accident, a 4- to 5-inch steel clip or carabiner was found in three pieces on the ground with its spine snapped. Providence . Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare stopped short of saying the . carabiner caused Sunday's accident at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and . Bailey circus, witnessed by about 3,900 people, many of them children. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is trying to . make a final determination. 'We don't know if it was metal fatigue, if it wasn't properly positioned or something else,' Pare said. 'We just don't know.' All eight of the acrobats were still hospitalized with injuries including a pierced liver and neck and back fractures, as well as head injuries. None of the injuries appear to be life-threatening, said Stephen Payne, a spokesman for Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company.

Pare said two of the acrobats are still in critical condition; three are in serious condition and three are stable. Two of them had . surgery, including Widny Neves, 25, who suffered a badly broken arm. Her . father Roiter told NBC News that it is a miracle that no one died. ‘The first thing in my mind is nobody . can survive. It's too high and too heavy, too many girls. But no one is . dead from this accident,’ he told NBC News. In addition to a broken arm, his daughter suffered minor fractures to her back and neck and will need months of physical therapy to recover. The women are from the United States, Brazil, Bulgaria and Ukraine, the circus said. A dancer on the ground was also injured and was released from the hospital Sunday. Roiter had no doubt she would return to big top and its most daring acts. 'All circus acts are dangerous jobs,' he said. 'If you work in that field, you accept the risk.' The rigging for the show was designed by the troupe's founder, Andre Medeiros, whose wife Viktoriya was in the air and is among the injured. The seriously injured . suffered broken bones and internal bleeding, while several other staff suffered minor . injuries. No audience members were hurt. 'All performers have received medial treatment and are resting comfortably, we are pleased though their injuries are serious none appear to be life threatening,' said Stephen Payne, a spokesman for Feld Entertainment, the parent company of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.

The eight women fell . 25 to 40 feet, landing on a dancer on the ground. Rhode Island Hospital in Providence admitted 11 patients with varying injuries. Three of the victims were ground personnel. It was witnessed by an audience of about 3,900, many of them children. All . the performers have been doing ‘some variation of this act for some . time,’ Payne said, though he didn't know how long.

A circus announcer told the audience that accidents can happen in live performances and thanked the first responders for there efforts. The hair-hanging stunt is described on the circus' website as a ‘larger-than-life act’ featuring eight female performers. ‘These “hairialists” perform a combination of choreography and cut-ups including spinning, hanging from hoops, and rolling down wrapped silks, all while being suspended 35 feet in the air by their hair alone,’ the website says. ‘In this hair-raising act, audiences will even see the weight of three girls held aloft by the locks of only one of these tangled beauties.’ Rosa Viveiros, right, from Seekonk, Mass., along with her niece Lily Lannon, 9, left, describe the accident that happened during the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus performance on Sunday .","An acrobatic stunt went horribly wrong on Sunday during a performance by the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Rhode Island .

"By . Josh Gardner . A Texas mother-of-two who was allegedly shot dead by her boyfriend's jilted ex in a tragic murder suicide Saturday has been pictured for the first time. Amy Picchiotti, 38, was found dead with Jonathon Masin, 40, at his Murphy home. The two bodies were partially clothed and barefoot in separate rooms, according to police. Masin's ex girlfriend, Michelle Boyer, 45, was found in her SUV hours later, near the home of her ex-husband, Charles Hobbs. Scroll down for video . Dead: Amy Picchiotti, 38, left, was found dead with Jonathon Masin, 40, at his Murphy home. The alleged killer, Michelle Boyer, right, was discovered dead in a car nearby . Police recovered a suicide note with Boyer's body, as well as a handgun allegedly similar to the one used to kill Masin and Picchiotti. Boyer and Masin both had worked at Texas Instruments and Picchiotti was a close friend of Boyer's, it has emerged. Brian Hasenbauer, who knew both women well, said that Boyer told him she was in a committed relationship with Masin when she learned Picchiotti was also romantically involved with him. 'We discussed the situation, and we tried to provide her comfort in dealing with the pain she was experiencing,' Hasenbauer wrote in an email to Dallasnews.com. 'We never imagined that this would ever happen, and we are praying for those that lost their lives.' Boyer and Picchiotti became friends while training for and running triathlons together in Dallas. Mom: Amy Picchiotti is pictured with her daughters . Lover: Boyer and Masin, pictured, both had worked at Texas Instruments and Picchiotti was a close friend of Boyer's . A fellow training partner, Gayle Mortola, said she was stunned at Boyer's alleged actions. 'There's nothing I know about ... [Boyer] that would lead me to believe she'd do anything like that at all,' she said. Picchiotti filed for divorce from her husband of almost seven years, Larry Picchiotti, in March. The couple had two young daughters and friends have set up a fundraising website in their honor. 'Though her life was punctuated with tremendous athletic accomplishments, her crowning achievements were her children,' the Youcaring.com site says of Picchiotti. 'These beautiful girls, proud of their artistic displays of affection, are now left with no mother to receive their show of love.' It didn't take long for police to label the shocking slaying a murder-suicide at the hands of a bitter ex-girlfriend. Boyer was discovered dead in her car from a self-inflicted gun shot wound. She left behind a note that police say detailed the ghastly scene. A town in shock: Police in the quiet Dallas suburb of Murphy say their first murder in recent memory involved the slaying of Jonathan Masin, 40, and 38-year-old Amy Picchiotti at the hands of Masin's scorned ex-girlfriend . Post: Picchiotti had included Masin in a post on Facebook in February, pictured . Boyer chose to kill herself while parked in front of the home of her ex-husband, whom she divorced in 2011. Neighbors of Masin's heard what they believed were gunshots around 6:30am Saturday. Later that morning, the father of one of the victims made a call to police for a welfare check at Masin's home, leading to the discovery of the bodies. 'Found in two separate parts of the home, they were partially clothed and barefooted,' said police in Murphy, where city manager James Fisher would later note that he couldn't remember a murder of any kind in the quiet town, much less such a sensational slaying. A few miles away in Dallas, Boyer's body was found in a parked car. She was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound from the same caliber weapon as the one that killed Masin and Picchiotti. She left a note behind that contained details of the murder scene. Police stopped short of naming a motive outright, 'however, it has been confirmed that Boyer is the ex-girlfriend of Masin and it is the breakup that led to this murder-suicide,' read a police news release.","Jonathan Masin, 40, and Amy Picchiotti, 38, were found shot dead in Masin's Murphy, Texas home on Saturday while just partially clothed .

"By . Josh Gardner . Snowfall expected in Detroit tonight could help push Michigan over the all-time record despite spring-like temperatures that neared 70F as late as 11pm Sunday. If more than 1.9 inches drifts down over the Wolverine State before winter finally releases its icy grip, snowfall will exceed the 93.6 inch record set in 1880. Some forecasts predicted up to three inches Monday night. While much of the East Coast reveled in summer-like temperatures Monday, even those were expected to fade into renewed wintery chills by Tuesday. Say it ain't so: Deeply winter-weary Michigan will again see temperatures plummet Monday and the state's even poised to break an over 130-year-old yearlong snowfall record . Record-breaking: A January photo show's Detroit blanketed in the white stuff, a site that became all too familiar to Michiganders this year. If Detroit sees over 1.9 inches Monday, the state will beat record of 93.6 inches set way back in 1880 . The dramatic step back into winter was prefaced by a barrage of soaking rains sweeping towards the east where the incoming cold front clashed with the outgoing warmth. According to Accuweather.com, the chances of Michigan breaking its 130-year-old snowfall record are low but not out of the question. On Sunday, the same storm system dumped six inches of snow onto Nebraska. As the cold air pushes onward, the East Coasters who enjoyed temperatures in the 70s on Monday  mercury could dip below freezing overnight Tuesday across the Ohio River Valley, the Appalachians and into the northeast just to the cusp of the I-95 corridor. Only southern Florida can expect to be spared from what is hopefully one of this record-shattering winter's last stands. WHY? The dramatic shift back into winter has already dumped 6 inches of snow on Nebraska and was poised to chill nearly all the East save for South Florida after a barrage of showers and severe thunderstorms .","The Motor City saw temperatures in the high 60s on Sunday but expects flooding rains followed by snow tonight .

Rodriguez, who was home at the time of the fire, later spoke about the blaze on Fox and then during her Emmy acceptance speech in June. She also told the audience that she and Gray had just gotten engaged. She said in an interview following the awards show: 'I lost everything in a house fire including all of my Emmys... It's been such a humbling experience.' The reporter's spokesman said that she was unaware of her fiancé's criminal past when they met. Rodriguez announced her resignation on her Facebook page on Tuesday and her intentions to clear her name. She wrote: 'I am heartbroken to say, I have decided to resign my position at FOX40. Given the recent media attention I feel it was the best decision to make. 'The past three years at FOX40 have been absolutely wonderful. From management to my colleagues in the newsroom and other departments, everyone is talented and kind. It's been a blessing to work and learn from all of you. 'To the viewers, thank you for your incredible love and support. It's overwhelming. 'Resigning was not an easy decision to make, but it's one that will allow me to focus on my case and work to reestablish my good name.' She will be arraigned on August 29. A Fox40 spokesperson recently told MailOnline: 'We were informed late Thursday July 31 that legal action has been taken against anchor Sabrina Rodriguez. 'These charges relate to a personal situation with Ms. Rodriguez that is not related to her work at Fox40. 'Sabrina maintains she is innocent of these allegations. She has been granted a voluntary leave of absence from the station.'","Sabrina Rodriguez, 31, turned herself into police last week over an outstanding warrant for grand theft .

"By . Louise Boyle . An elderly homeless man watched in tears as the home he'd built in the woods six years before was torn down by police. Sam's eyes filled up as he silently watched the sturdy, wooden structure  bulldozed along with his carefully tended garden trimmed with a white picket fence. Until last month, Sam lived in a woodland camp of 80-100 people, known as Tent City, on the edge of Lakewood Township, New Jersey. Scroll down for video . Sam, who has lived his little wooden home in the woods for six years, watched as Lakewood Township police move in to supervise the demolishing of his home . A bulldozer was brought in to crush the home which was one of the last left standing in a community known as Tent City . The home was demolished after the Tent City community was evicted by the township in order to protect wetlands, Lakeland Township has claimed . Sam, who grew up in foster care and has lived his whole life close to nature, watched as his home was destroyed. As part of a legal settlement with the people of Tent City, Lakewood Township had him rehoused in a motel for one year . His home was bulldozed at the end of June after a long-running legal battle between Lakewood Township and the homeless came to an end. Around five years ago, Lakewood Township sued the people of Tent City in order to evict them from the land. The township has claimed that the woodlands were endangered wetlands and the trees and environment must be protected. But still there are unconfirmed suspicions that building work is being planned for where the camp once stood. MailOnline reached out to Lakewood Township Mayor and Planning Department with messages today but received no response at the time of publication. Following the intervention of a powerful, Manhattan litigation attorney, Jeff Wild, the homeless community counter-sued the township. They reasoned that their camp needed to exist because there was no homeless shelter in Ocean County, New Jersey. After a long-running battle, the case was finally settled last year. Each person in the camp was offered temporary housing for a year to leave Tent City or a cash settlement of $3,500. The home and its fenced garden were flattened by the bulldozer at the end of June. The community had been standing in the woods for eight years . Sam watched in tears along with two police officers who had grown close to the tented community over their years on the fringe of Lakewood Township . Sam's home ended up in a dumpster. In exchange, he has been given a year living in a motel by local authorities as part of a court settlement . Sam was one of the last to leave. He had grown up in foster care system and as a young child, had often run away into the woods to live. Without a family structure, Sam had grown comfortable living close to nature and had come to Tent City for its sense of community. He had asked the police officers, with whom the people of Tent City had a close bond, if they would allow him to watch his little home being torn down. They stood alongside him as they bulldozer crushed the home and hoisted it into a dumpster. Sam, for the next year at least, lives in a motel. Jack Ballo, who made film Destiny's Bridge about Sam and the community at Tent City's battle to save their homes, told MailOnline today: 'Sam had lived off the land before. He's a friendly, intelligent and hard-working guy. 'He doesn't drink and he doesn't do drugs. He just wanted to live in the way that he liked. It's sad because he belonged out there.' Mr Ballo spent a year with the community of Tent City, documenting their lives and what brought them to live in the woods. The council were fair to the homeless, he said, by moving them one by one over a year-long period and proving them with temporary shelter. They also helped with furniture and utilities. However people also lost a sense of community with their family, friends and neighbors that had built up over eight years in the woods. Mr Ballo said: 'What would have been good would be to give these people the support they needed - social work, job training - things that could help them back on their feet and into society.' Many people in Tent City, like Sam, had chosen to live there instead of sleeping on the streets or in an endless cycle of temporary shelters. Although the authorities deemed the woodland camp 'temporary', many of the homeless people living there saw it as their home and a place to belong . One resident was a keen piano player at the camp, entertaining other residents. His playing has been captured as part of new film Destiny's Bridge which documents the lives of those who live at Tent City . Others in the community were battling drug and alcohol addictions while some were struggling with mental illnesses. The film-maker said: 'A lot of homeless people have gone through things where they don't have family or friends or any support. Often they are alone in their world. 'But Tent City gave them that support - it gave them community and it gave them a sense of belonging and ownership.' Lakewood Township police Lt. Joseph Goertz  confirmed to MailOnline today that the homeless at Tent City had been relocated to temporary housing. He said: 'A lot of the population were using alcohol and drugs. It transpired there were some less than glowing things going on.' The officer admitted that although there was no homeless shelter in Lakewood Township, there was a place in Tom's River ten miles away. The film Destiny's Bridge focuses on the Lakewood Township homeless but as Mr Ballo pointed out, tent cities are springing up across the U.S. The National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty pooled media reports on tent cities over five years and found that as of 2013, there were 100 tent communities in the U.S. And that number is growing. There are more than 630,000 people living homeless in the U.S., according to recent figures from the National Alliance To End Homelessness. Destiny's Bridge is a concept by New Jersey minister Steve Brigham who believes in creating new housing solutions to deal with homelessness. It has also led to the growth of the tiny house movement which Mr Ballo pointed to as an alternative to tent cities. However despite their popularity, the homes have run into problems over strict laws on building codes and zoning. Mr Ballo, who previously made films about impoverished communities of the Dominican Republic, believes that the U.S. may have something to learn from such third world societies when it comes to its own burgeoning homelessness dilemma. He said: 'It didn’t take me long to realize that the answer to poverty in the United States is no different then it is in the poorest areas around the world. 'Maybe this country needs to provide the opportunity for the poor to live a simple life with basic necessities. 'Isn’t it the American way to allow a person to build a house that they can afford? Our society has become accustomed to creating laws and regulations that forbid people from living a simple life.'

"By . Louise Boyle . Ross Bonaddio, 44, allegedly beat his girlfriend and held her captive in his home in Pennsylvania . An alleged kidnapping victim has been jailed by a judge to ensure that she testifies against the boyfriend believed to have beaten her and held her captive. Faith Bronson, 34, from Scranton, Pennsylvania, is under house arrest until the trial of Ross Bonaddio, 44, in September. According to court documents, Ms Bronson had suggested to prosecutors that she would not cooperate and that she wanted to recant her police statements, prompting her arrest on July 24. Bonaddio was arrested on January 27 after Ms Bronson called 911 to report that she had been held hostage for three days. Police used a stun gun on Bonaddio at his Scranton home and released the naked woman who had been beaten. The Times-Tribune reported that Bonaddio has schizophrenia and has hallucinations. He had reportedly kept his girlfriend captive as he was trying to beat demons out of her as part of an exorcism. The words: 'Aliens in/out of human and animal bodies, Evil spirits enter invisible' was written on basement walls, according to The Times-Tribune. Judge Saxton ordered the alleged kidnap victim put under house arrest last month . Ms Bronson claimed that Bonaddio said his teenage sons had been taken over by aliens and he planned to shoot them when they next entered his home. Every door in the house was barricaded apart from the kitchen door which was bolted shut. Bonaddio was charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment and attempted simple assault. He is being held on $100,000 bail. Judge Richard Saxton put Ms Bronson under house arrest and ordered her not have any contact with Bonaddio. Although Ms Bronson can be compelled to be at the trial, she cannot be forced to testify.

"By . Louise Boyle . A multimillionaire mother-of-five who gave up her Chinese daughter for re-adoption and attempted to cut her out of the $250million family estate is now suing a gardening company whom she claims ripped her off to the tune of $3million. Christine Svenningsen, 56, who inherited millions from her late husband, is suing a groundskeeping firm owned by her second husband whom she claimed charged an extra $3million for work on her property empire. The alleged fraud claim to light in March, according to the New York Daily News, after Ms Svenningsen, of Westchester, had divorced 61-year-old John Chiarella. Christine Svenningsen, of Westchester, pictured with her five biological children, gave up two Chinese children she adopted. She then tried to keep her former adopted daughter out of her late husband's will. She is now suing her ex-husband's gardening firm as she claims she was overcharged by $3million . She had employed her ex-husband and his brother, using their firm Ultimate Services to take care of her multiple luxury island homes, cars and boats. According to the Daily News, Ms Svenningsen claimed that the company had done a shoddy job by failing to landscape the grounds correctly at her homes or prepare boats and property for the winter months. Ms Svenningsen said that the company was paid $5million but that she believes that cost was inflated by at least $3million. She claimed in the suit that her ex's company is refusing to return boats and cars that belong to her. The property magnate is suing her second husband John Chiarella's landscaping company. The pair divorced in March . Last year, the Daily News reported that Ms Svenningsen first adopted a girl from China, named Emily in 1996. She already had five biological children with her husband John Svenningsen, 27 years her senior. Before the adoption was finalized, her husband was diagnosed with cancer. According to court documents, on May 6, 1996, the Svenningsens signed an adoption agreement stating they would not abandon Emily or 'transfer or have [her] re-adopted', and that she would be deemed 'a biological child'. The agreement also stated that Emily had the right to inherit the estate of her adopted parents, who had established a pair of trusts for their children, as well as one meant solely for Emily, according to ABC. In December 2004, seven years after her party goods magnate husband died from cancer, Mrs Svenningsen put Emily up for adoption. She surrendered the girl to an adoption agency in New York claimg that Emily, then eight years old, was a difficult child and unable to bond with the family. The Daily News cited separate court documents where it was claimed she treated her adopted daughter, who reportedly has special needs, different from her other children. The child was allegedly kept apart at meal times and at one point forced to sleep outside as a punishment. It was later suggested that the wealthy widow may have wanted to terminate Emily's interest in her husband's estate,according to court documents. The little girl was readopted by a married couple. The Daily News reported last year that Ms Svenningsen then tried to cut Emily out of the family's vast fortune, a bid which was denied last year. The couple had no idea about the money legally owed to their newly adopted daughter from the trust, but eventually learned that the late John Svenningsen had arranged to provide for Emily’s educational and medical needs.

Ms Svenningsen, pictured here with four of five of her biological children, adopted a girl and then a boy from China before giving them up for adoption . It was also revealed that the property millionaire adopted a boy from China after her husband had died. But court papers show that after his arrival to suburban Westchester County in New York, the boy named Eric was given up for adoption, according to the Daily News. He was readopted by a family living in New Jersey because the mother said that another baby was more than she could handle. Ms Svenningsen said in court documents she 'couldn't handle' that many children. Christine Svenningsen, remarried to John Chiarella, a landscaping entrepreneur who managed her islands in July 2010. Their divorce was finalized in January 2014. Mr Chiarella started Ultimate Services Professional Ground Management in 1971 and has built the company into a firm with 100 employees. MailOnline had reached out for comment to Ultimate Services' lawyer, Richard Corde. The lawyer told the Daily News that Ms Svenningsen's claims were 'meritless'. The homes on the exclusive Thimble Islands off the Long Island Sound are popular vacation spots with the super-wealthy and the famous . According to the real estate website curbed.com, Svenningsen, 'spent $36M amassing a collection of nine Thimble Islands'. The property developer has reportedly rented Belden Island - which she paid $2.77million for in 2006 - to TV network A&E to filme a new reality show Love Prison, beginning in August. One-acre Belden Island, which has its own beach, dock and putting green, is also on the market for $3.95million.

A 24-year-old American man who fell into a coma after seizures has died in Liberia while his family fought to get him out of the country amid a border lockdown over the Ebola outbreak. Nathaniel Dennis, 24, from Maryland, died on Wednesday morning at Aspen Medical in Sinkor, Liberia. He had been in a coma since July 24 after suffering seizures earlier this month while on vacation visiting family. Due to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Mr Dennis was unable to be medically evacuated to a facility in Ghana which had the proper facilities to treat him - despite testing negative for the deadly disease. Scroll down for video . Nathaniel Dennis, 24, from Maryland, died on Wednesday morning at Aspen Medical in Sinkor, Liberia . The 24-year-old lay comatose and was unable to receive the life-saving treatment that he needed, including a respirator and kidney dialysis machine, which the medical center did not have. Mr Dennis had been quarantined for three days after he fell ill at JFK Medical Center over fears he had the Ebola virus. A few days later, the Liberian government closed most of the country's borders to try to stop the spread of Ebola. The Dennis family hired a Medevac unit on July 27, in the hopes they could take him to Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Ghana but the country refused to grant clearance to land. Doctors, with the help of the U.S. Embassy and the Ghanaian government, had tried to find a neurologist to assess the young man but were unable to do so in time. On the family's GoFundMe page today, his sister Natasha Dennis wrote: 'This is a circumstance of timing, logistics, and unpreparedness by local governments. 'It could have been prevented. We don’t know what happened to him; besides lack of immediate treatment.' Nathaniel Dennism passed away today at Aspen Medical in Sinkor, Liberia after falling into a coma from seizures.

He had posted $250,000 bail. Mozdir had been wanted on five counts of lewd acts upon a child younger than 14 and a charge of attempting to keep a witness from prosecuting a crime, according to the criminal complaint.

Child pornography was recovered at Mozdir's home, U.S. Marshals Service deputy Brian Grimes told CNN. Mozdir was later arrested and made bail, he then skipped an arraignment and went on the run. Mozdir allegedly molested a second boy in a similar incident, the channel said. Mozdir's scent was found by a hound on a highway and his car was recovered in Georgia, but investigators were unable to find the alleged child molester, CNN said.

That gunman, David Garvin, killed a bartender, according to police, and then turned crowded streets packed with storied taverns into a shooting gallery. Unarmed volunteer officers Eugene Marshalik and Nicholas Todd Pekearo were killed.","Detective Mario Muniz, 45, a married father from Queens, left Bellevue Hospital on Wednesday in a wheelchair .

"By . Louise Boyle . Two armed men believed to be in their late fifties held up a medical clinic for a stash of Viagra this weekend, police said. The pair brandished guns in broad daylight in front of staff and patients on Saturday at 3pm in the Austin neighborhood of Chicago. According to police, the two men, neither one disguising their face, came to the center and asked to see a dentist. Scroll down for video . Two older men who have yet to be identified held up a medical clinic on Saturday in Chicago and stole thousands of dollars of prescription drugs including a stash of Viagra . Once an employee opened the door, they pointed a handgun and semi-automatic at him and told him to get down on his knees with his hands up, CBS reported. They stole 56 Viagra pills with a value of $1,700, Xanex, various painkillers and a codeine-laced cough syrup, according to CBS. They also stole a laptop and a small amount of cash from the employee's wallet. One man was dressed in a brown shirt and stocking cap while the other was wearing a Tasmanian devil T-shirt and a leather flat cap. They were described as being in their late fifties and being a little nervous, witnesses said. The entire hold-up was caught on the clinic's surveillance cameras.

"By . Louise Boyle . and Associated Press . Two people were arrested when a brawl involving almost 300 wedding guests broke out at a reception in central New Jersey. Middletown Township police said the party had been going on for several hours when the fight started on Sunday night around 10.30pm. It apparently began inside the hall and spilled out on to the street. Officers arriving on scene found several guests who were mostly shoving each other and shouting, so assistance was sought from several nearby police departments. The wedding reception had been underway for several hours in Middletown Township, New Jersey on Saturday when a fight broke out and spilled into the street . Bystanders told News12 that guests were urinating outside the Jacques Reception Center in Middletown. According . to a police statement, Sergeant William Colangelo and Patrolman Frank . Mazza were working the reception as an off-duty assignment when they . were alerted to a fight taking place. The reception hall provides security for all of its events as part of the service. The officers attempted to break up the . fight when the crowd, of which many people had been drinking, swelled to about 80 people. The officers radioed for back-up to disperse the crowd. As officers tried to gain . control of the situation approximately 300 people became involved in the . altercation which consisted of fighting, yelling and screaming and . people refusing to leave the area and return inside to the reception, police reported. The Middletown police department received help from departments in Keansburg, . Holmdel and Hazlet at the rowdy scene. Police chiefs decided that the wedding had to be shut down because of the chaos. Order was eventually restored, but authorities shut down the reception and told the guests to leave. It took about 45 minutes to clear out the facility. It’s not clear what sparked the brawl, but an iunvestigation is ongoing. No injuries were reported. Jonathan Accardi, 32, from Oceanside, New York, was arrested for obstruction and disorderly conduct. Emily George, 23, from . Haledon, New Jersey was arrested for disorderly conduct.

"By . Louise Boyle . A longtime volunteer with an animal protection organization in New Jersey has pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges. Authorities found more than 300 dead birds and animals in the Little . Silver home of 56-year-old Gretchen Rell's 95-year-old mother. Her . attorney said Rell was overwhelmed by the number of animals in her . care. She had volunteered with the Monmouth County Society for the . Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Gretchen Rell, 56, pleaded guilty on Monday to stockpiling the carcasses of dead animals in the basement of her mother's home in New Jersey . Rell . entered her plea on Monday. The Asbury Park Press reported . that under terms of the plea agreement, Rell . will be sentenced to probation in September. She'll also have to . undergo mental health treatment, serve 30 days of community service, . have no contact with the SPCA and shall not own, reside with or take . into care or custody any pet. 'She never intended to harm any of the birds, she just got completely overwhelmed,' Rell’s defense attorney, Dennis Melofchick told app.com. Rell . was indicted in May for animal cruelty after police said she hoarded . hundreds of pigeons, small mammals, turtles and other creatures in her . 95-year-old mother's $1 million home only to let them starve and die. Authorities said the smell was . horrific in the Little Silver home where Gretchen Rell allegedly had . the decomposed creatures stacked five-feet high unbeknown to her mother, . whom she was told to 'never go into the basement'. Many . of the animals that Rell, a 20-plus year volunteer at the Monmouth . County SPCA, left to wither in the home and garage were still sealed in . their original carrying crates. 'Never go in the basement': Authorities say they found animals stacked 5-feet-high from floor to ceiling in the basement of her mother's home, where she warned her never to go . Gretchen Rell, 56, pleaded guilty on Monday to hoarding the carcasses of hundreds of animals at her 95-year-old mother's New Jersey home. She will be sentenced to probation and undergo mental health treatment . Authorities first discovered the stomach-turning stash of creatures back in March. 'We have more than 300 animals and counting,' Monmouth SPCA's chief law officer Victor Amato told the Asbury Park Press. 'Ninety-nine percent are dead birds. Most of them are seagulls, pigeons, robins, wrens and loons.' Investigators say they also found turtles, mice, rabbits, possums and other mammals too decomposed to identify 'stacked from floor to ceiling, five feet high,' according to Amato. Rell's LinkedIn account lists her occupation as MCSPCA Wildlife Coordinator since April 1992. 'I am in charge of placing injured or orphaned wildlife with State Licensed Wildlife Rehabilitators,' Rell writes in the job description. 'I am also in charge of transportation to those rehabbers and facilities.' Authorities . say that instead of following through with her job and getting the sick . and injured animals treatment, she took them home and allowed them to . dehydrate, starve and perish. Rell . was once seen by a number chasing down and capturing an injured seagull . on her mother's street, one neighbor told the Asbury Park Press. Area . children were also known take injured animals to Rell. Some . neighbors had begun to wonder what Rell was really up to by the time of . her March arrest and there were complaints of smells coming from her . mother's home. The home contained the decomposing bodies of mostly pigeons but also contained various seabirds and ducks, possums, rabbits and mice--many of them in their original sealed crates from a rescue organization . So how did she get away with hoarding so many creatures for so long? 'To be honest,' said Amato, 'when you were upstairs, you could smell a slight odor. It wouldn't be what you would expect with 300 dead animals.' Rell's own residence, where she lives with her husband, is in nearby Ocean Township. Authorities visited that residence and say they found 60 additional animals. On Monday, Rell was indicted in Ocean Township on two counts of third-degree animal cruelty, rerports Philly.com. The maximum possible sentence for the counts is five years behind bars. But even her accusers likely won't push for such a punishment. 'Gretchen was well intended. She is a nice person,' Amato told the Asbury Park Press in March. 'But what happens is they get overwhelmed and don't know how to ask for help. They get carried away. It's hoarding, no matter what.'","Authorities found more than 300 dead birds and animals in the Little .

"By . Louise Boyle . and James Rush . Amanda Knox's alleged links to a circle of Italian cocaine dealers could provide new clues in the murder of British student Meredith Kercher almost seven years ago. The Italian prosecutor in the murder trial allegedly recently gave a local newspaper the names of the men, one of whom was a known associate of Knox whose number was found on her cell phone. According to RadarOnline, during the investigation into Miss Kercher's death in Perugia in 2007, police uncovered a drug ring in the sleepy Italian city. Scroll down for videos . Amanda Knox (pictured left) had alleged links to a ring of cocaine dealers whom she bought drugs from, it has been claimed in the Italian media, leading to suggestions that it could provide new clues in the murder of British student Meredith Kercher (right) in 2007 . Knox allegedly had the number of a suspected drug dealer in her phone. According to Italian newspaper Giallo, the American met the student from Rome on a train from Milan to Florence and shared a joint with him. They stayed in touch with the man, only identified as 'F', dealing drugs to Knox and occasionally having a sexual relationship with her. Police . papers allegedly show calls had been made between the 26-year-old . American and a drug dealer in the days before and after the murder of Miss Kercher. Italian prosecutor Luciano Giuliano Mignini allegedly gave a local newspaper a list of drug dealers' names who were link to Amanda Knox . A Giallo article claims that 'F' along with two friends ended up on trial for dealing cocaine, charges that were brought after Knox's phone was analyzed. One man, 'Luciano', was arrested in 2006 for attempting to murder his brother with a kitchen knife in a dispute over drugs. According to RadarOnline, prosecutor Luciano Giuliano Mignini confirmed the link of the drug ring to Amanda Knox. Mignini allegedly told Giallo that he could not say if Knox knew drug dealers - but wrote down their names for the paper's reporter. According to reports earlier this month, Italian . prosecutors are preparing to use Amanda Knox's alleged links to the cocaine ring to extradite her to Italy. Knox . has vowed she would never 'willingly' return to Italy, where she and . ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were reconvicted earlier this year of . the killing of 21-year-old Miss Kercher.

Garner had a history of selling untaxed cigarettes, but the deceased . man's family insisted he had none . on him at the time of the deadly arrest. The father-of-six was not armed, according to reports. Garner had a court date scheduled in October for selling untaxed cigarettes and pot possession, records showed. His . wife said that he had a history of ill health, including asthma and . diabetes, which made it difficult for him to hold down a job. On the video, Garner is seen sitting outside a store when he is approached by plainclothes officers. Garner can be heard telling the cops: 'Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today.' More officers arrive and when Garner refuses to put his hands behind his back to be cuffed, an officer grabs him from behind in a chokehold. Several other officers then wrestle the man to the ground before one appears to pin his head to the concrete. After repeatedly telling the officers 'I can't breathe', Garner goes quiet and stops struggling. Police are seen on the cellphone footage trying to move bystanders away from the rapidly deteriorating situation, but the shooter of the footage is remarkably able to capture what is happening. Confrontation: Eric Garner was stopped by police on this sidewalk . After the incident, posters saying 'no justice, no peace' 'and Another innocent black man has been killed by police brutality. The NYPD must be stopped!' appeared in the area. Reverend Lloyd Land, from the First United Christian Church, told Staten Island Live: 'He was a gentle giant. Insofar as violence, I don't believe if you smack him in the face he would hit you back ... The police have no reason to attack him.' New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio promised a full investigation into Mr Garner's death. 'On behalf of all New Yorkers, I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Mr Garner, who died yesterday afternoon while being placed in police custody,' hizzoner said in a Friday statement. 'We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD. That is a responsibility that Police Commissioner Bratton and I take very seriously. We are harnessing all resources available to the City to ensure a full and thorough investigation of the circumstances of this tragic incident. 'The NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau is working closely with the Office of the Richmond County District Attorney, which is leading this investigation.'","Eric Garner, a 43-year-old who weighed 400lb and suffered from asthma, can be heard shouting 'I can't breathe' on cellphone footage .

"By . Sarah Michael . Just over one year ago, Pattaramon Chanbua was a mother-of-two living with her grandparents and working in a food stall at the front of their home. But the 21-year-old from Chon Buri - a province about 80km south of Bangkok - now finds herself the face of an international row over the legality and ethics of the business of surrogacy in Thailand after it was revealed she was a surrogate for an Australian couple who allegedly abandoned one of the babies when they returned home. Ms Pattaramon claims David and Wendy Farnell, from Bunbury in Western Australia, did not want seven-month-old baby Gammy when they found he had Down syndrome and took only his twin sister. Her Facebook account also reveals more about her life - dozens of selfies taken alongside her family, including her husband and Gammy - and what appears to be messages suggesting she was trying to scout for other surrogate mothers. Scroll down for video . Pattaramon Chanbua (pictured here with her husband and baby Gammy) lives 90km south of Thai capital, Bangkok, in an industrial area . Two bicycles sit at the unit complex where Ms Pattaramon rents with her husband for 2,200 baht per month, which equates to $74, in Chon Buri . Photos from inside the hospital where Gammy is staying have been posted on her Facebook page . It has since emerged David Farnell is a convicted paedophile after he was jailed for 22 child sex offences. But his son has defended his father, telling The Sydney Morning Herald that it was 'heartbreaking' his father's dark past was being revisited. Previous media reports suggested the Farnells' chosen surrogate, Pattaramon Chanbua, lived in an impoverished Thai village, but Ms Pattaramon actually rents and lives in a unit complex in an industrial area in Chon Buri. Her grandparents live at the food stall, which is nearby, and Ms Pattaramon works a few days per month - where she cooks and cleans with her grandmother - but rents a unit in the complex with her husband for 2,200 baht per month, which equates to $74. My Pattaramon was paid a total of $16,000 by the Australian couple to give birth to the baby. Her grandparents's stall where she works occasionally makes roughly $300 a month. The unit is basic with one bedroom and one bathroom, but it is her own place and a step up from the home she was sharing with her grandparents, husband and two children. Ms Pattaramon's Facebook page is littered with photos of Gammy (left) and her husband (right) Some locals, who have bought ice cream from another portable vendor, stop in front of Ms Pattaramon's grandparents' stall . Ms Pattaramon grew up at her grandparent's home and the family has been living there for about 20 years . The house is locked up with a metal front gate but no door. No one has been into the house for more than a week . Now Ms Pattaramon's two eldest children live with her part of the time, but also stay with her grandparents often. Neighbours said Ms Pattaramon grew up at her grandparents' home and the family has been living there for about 20 years. The house is locked by a metal front gate but no door. Neighbours say they have not seen anyone go into the house since Gammy was admitted to hospital more than a week ago. They told the Daily Mail Australia they believed her grandmother was with her at nearby Samitivej Sriracha Hospital where Gammy is receiving treatment for pneumonia. They were unsure where her eldest children were staying, but they have been seen at the hospital and also with Ms Pattaramon visiting her unit. A small dog sits out the front of the stall next to a bowl filled with water and another half-filled with rice, but it is unclear who is feeding it. At the front of the house are tables with baskets filled with plates, glasses and pots for cooking. There is also a gas bottle stove and bottles of condiments to go with the Thai salads the stall normally serves, which cost between 30 and 40 baht ($1 to $1.30). A table for serving, topped with a green umbrella, sits to the left of the house's facade. The unit complex Ms Pattaramon lives in with her children part of the time, who also often live with her grandparents (pictured is her neighbour) For 2,200 baht a month, the unit would have one bedroom and one bathroom . Ms Pattaramon's landlord at the unit complex, who wished to remain anonymous, told Daily Mail Australia she had moved in just over a year ago . Ms Pattaramon's landlord at the unit complex, who wished to remain anonymous, told Daily Mail Australia she had moved in just over a year ago. 'Probably she was already pregnant when she moved in, it was just not very obvious,' she said, speaking through a translator. Since Gammy was admitted to hospital she has been back to visit every few days to pick up clothing and belongings. Sometimes she brings her two eldest children with her. The landlord also said that during her pregnancy she seemed to have more money, and would buy a lot of handbags and accessories. During her pregnancy, Ms Pattaramon also told her landlord that when she gave birth she was going to give the baby to her 'sister', who had a foreign acquaintance that could not conceive children. One of the many photos Ms Pattaramon has of herself and her husband on Facebook . It has also emerged the mother allegedly solicited women on Facebook for donor eggs . Neighbours on the street where her grandparents own a food stall also said she appeared to have more money when she became pregnant, but kept quiet about the details of her pregnancy. Jumpol, who owns a barber shop on the street, said Ms Pattaramon started wearing expensive new clothes and handbags. The 49-year-old added Ms Pattaramon's husband worked in a company in Sriracha, but he did not believe he was the father of her eldest children. Jumpol also said Ms Pattaramon only worked at the stall a few days per month. Other neighbours, who did not wish to be named, also said when she was pregnant she was buying more accessories such as 'gold chains'. Neighbour Kai, who runs a small convenience store on the street, said Ms Pattaramon was not very social with people on the street. The 42-year-old told Daily Mail Australia Ms Pattaramon worked sometimes at the stall selling salad and other Thai dishes, mainly to students who lived in a nearby dormitory. She added the stall would make about 9,000 or 10,000 baht per month ($300 to $334 per month).

Another neighbour Kai, who runs a small convenience store on the street, said Ms Pattaramon was not very social with people on the street . This comes after posts found on Ms Chanbua's Facebook suggested she was trying to solicit women for egg donation and surrogacy. The posts were made on Facebook  in April and May this year, but have since been deleted. 'Job available egg donation meeting the client tomorrow we need people who are with the age between 20 to 27 with height more than 160cm with weight not more than 60 kg with blood group A and the payment rate will be 20,000 to 50,000 baht cash [$668 to $1670],' she wrote on May 16. On April 25, Ms Pattaramon wrote: 'Right now we are looking for a great number of good-hearted mothers from Bangkok as well as other provinces. If you are interested, we can talk.' And on May 16 she wrote: 'Job available for women with blood group A who are tall, nice looking egg donation very urgent.' Thai media also reported that in one Facebook post Ms Chanbua wrote: 'For people who are interested in a surrogation job please fill in the following message accordingly: first name nickname blood type age date of birth nationality height weight eye colour hair colour facial form education hobbies and send seven to eight pictures.' Since David and Wendy Farnell were identified as the biological parents of baby Gammy on Tuesday, Western Australia's Department of Child Protection have been seeking them for a meeting. A spokeswoman for the department's minister said officials had got in touch with the couple on Thursday, but she did not confirm if they had met in person or spoken over the phone.

The adult son of Farnell, a convicted paedophile, defended his father, who has been convicted of 22 child sex offences . Also on Thursday, the son of Farnell, a convicted paedophile, defended his father, who has been convicted of 22 child sex offences. 'He's taken 10 years to get his life back on track and he did and he has done so well and this, this has been shattering,' the unnamed son was quoted as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald. 'I can tell you how good of a father my dad was towards us. He's amazing,' the unnamed son was quoted saying. 'He's brought out the best in all us kids. He's just got a massive heart. He's made mistakes, we've accepted it... he's made up for them.' His comments came after it was revealed Farnell was convicted of 22 child sex offences, including one against a girl who was just seven. The sentencing judge said the victims had been 'robbed of their childhood'. It had earlier been reported that David John Farnell, now 56, had been sentenced to three years' jail in 1997 for sexually molesting two girls under the age of 13 and that months later, while still in prison, he was charged again, this time with six counts of indecent dealing with a child under the age of 13. But further court documents have revealed other sex offences, bringing the total number of convictions against him to 22 - including a victim aged just seven.","Pattaramon Chanbua, 21, lives in Chon Buri - 80km south of Bangkok .

"By . Sarah Michael . Former child actor and Young Talent Time star Debra Byrne has come forward with new claims she was abused on set as a teenager and has posted a plea for witnesses to contact her on Facebook. Byrne, 57, named two of her alleged abusers and described being assaulted in a swimming pool during the filming of 1972 film Caravan Holiday. 'After a day's filming we the YTT and crew were swimming in a pool. I don't recall where the pool was but while I was in the pool [name withheld] swam up to me and digitally raped me,' she wrote in the post, which has since been deleted. Scroll down for video . Debra Byrne (left) with her Young Talent Time co-stars in 1971 including Johnny Young (third from left) Byrne posted a plea for witnesses to alleged abuse she suffered on set to come forward on Facebook, but has since deleted the post . 'I was a very disturbed girl and was abused I believe because I was considered fair game.' Byrne – who would have been about 15 years old at the time - also referenced another incident which she alleged took place while she and Young Talent Time star Johnny Young were filming a Red Tulip Chocolates commercial. 'There were more than two people in the studio. If this jogs anyone's memory and you are comfortable to speak with me about what took place in the studio please contact me,' she posted. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Byrne for comment. Debra Byrne has launched an appeal on Facebook for witnesses to come forward over an alleged incident in 1972 . Speaking on behalf of her father, Young's daughter Anna said Byrne should report the incidents to police, news.com.au reported. 'He would like her to go to the police, if she feels so strongly about it, rather than put it on Facebook,' Ms Young said. 'He feels if any woman has been wronged in any way — he's very protective — go to the police, don't put it on Facebook. 'We wish her all the best, if she does feel there is something that happened to her I agree with my dad, she really needs to go to the police.' Entertainment reporter Peter Ford, who spoke to Young on Sunday night, said Young denied knowing any alleged abuse was taking place. 'The suggestion with Deb often seems to be that Johnny Young knew what was going on and didn't do anything,' Mr Ford to radio 3AW. 'Johnny is adamant he didn't know anything. He certainly wouldn't have allowed it.' In 2006 Byrne, a mother of three, released her memoir Not Quite Ripe in which she detailed her troubled childhood and teenage years - including the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her maternal grandfather and her battles with drug addiction and depression. Byrne, who starred on Young Talent Time between the ages of 12 and 16, also detailed an ongoing sexual relationship she had as a 13 year old with a crew member who was more than 10 years older than her. He was charged with statutory rape. Byrne, who grew up in a religious family but left the church in her early teens, has since returned to Christianity. She has had a long, successful career as an actress and pop singer, appearing in TV shows including The Secret Life of Us, Home and Away and most recently Fat Tony & Co on Channel 9.

The pictures allegedly show Rush holding and inhaling from drug paraphernalia and were taken in January, the Herald Sun reported. An unnamed source told the newspaper the 28-year-old was smoking crack cocaine, and added he would often take drugs during late-night parties. Scroll down for video . Photographs allegedly show Bali Nine drug trafficker Scott Rush using drugs in prison . The pictures allegedly show Rush holding and inhaling from drug paraphernalia and were taken in January . 'He has been telling people he has been clean of drugs for ages and that just isn't true,' they said. In June, Rush proposed to his successful London banker girlfriend who said she would only marry him if he turns his life around and is not doing any drugs. During a prison visit Rush dropped to one knee and asked 38-year-old mother-of-two Nikki Butler to marry him, more than nine years after they met for just a few hours before he was stopped with 1.3kg of heroin strapped to his body. Ms Butler had lost touch with the 28-year-old drug smuggler during his years of incarceration, but reunited with him in April after she recognised an image of him on British TV which referenced the Bali Nine. An unnamed source told the Herald Sun the 28-year-old was smoking crack cocaine, and added he would often take drugs during late-night parties . Earlier this year he became the second of the Bali nine drug couriers to be moved out of Kerobokan Prison, moving to Karangasem in Bali's far east. 'Rush was moved in February this year because he was getting beaten up and getting some serious threats over a drug debt of about $5000,' the source told the Herald Sun. Kerobokan prison is awash with drugs, particularly crystal methamphetamine and heroin, with the trade controlled by local gangs. At just 19 years of age Rush was committed to stand trial and sentenced to life in prison after his  arrest at a Denpasar airport with 1.8 kg of heroin concealed on his body. After an appeal he was given the death penalty - which was later overturned back to a life in 2011. The couple hope that sentence will be reduced to between 15 and 20 years.

"By . Sarah Michael . One of Australia's top-ranked young tennis players could be banned from the sport for two years after he was found to have taken the drug ecstasy - but he only faces a penalty because he tested positive on a match day. Bradley Mousley, 18, has admitted to taking ecstasy two days before he was due to play at Melbourne Park on March 30, but will argue for a shorter sentence because he did not take the drug on a competition day, The Australian reported. Under World Anti-Doping Agency rules, ecstasy is permitted for use outside competition and players who test positive on non-competition days do not face penalties. Bradley Mousley faces a two-year ban from tennis after he was found to have taken ecstasy . Mousley, . who is close friends with fellow young tennis star Nick Kyrgios, is due . to appear before a tribunal hearing in Melbourne on Tuesday. Mousley's father Craig Mousley told Daily Mail Australia he could not comment on his son's legal defence. 'There's a hearing tomorrow, we're just going to go to the hearing see . where it goes,' said Mr Mousley, who has been a coach and member of . Tennis Australia for 22 years. 'I really don't want to talk about anything at the moment.' Tennis Australia will argue for a full two-year suspension - a ban that could ruin Mousley's tennis career. Lawyers acting for Mousley, Patrick Liptak and Paul Hayes, will reportedly argue that the drug would not have enhanced Mousley's performance because he took it two days before the match. On those grounds they will reportedly argue he should only receive a three-month ban from the sport. Tennis Australia will argue that the amount of ecstasy found in Mousley's system is consistent with him having taken the drug the night before the game. They will argue for a two-year ban, in a push to stamp out a hard partying culture among its younger athletes. Mousley has been suspended since his positive drug result was returned in May, and he has missed the junior French Open and Wimbledon tournaments as a result. Barrister Paul Hayes told Daily Mail Australia he was unable to comment. A Tennis Australia spokeswoman said: 'Tennis Australia abides by the Tennis Integrity Unit confidentiality policy and makes no public comment other than to ""confirm the outcome of an investigation that results in disciplinary action being taken"".'","Bradley Mousley, 18, is due to appear before a Melbourne tribunal hearing .

"By . Sarah Michael . Baby Gammy could leave hospital within days after doctors confirmed he did not have a congenital heart condition despite fears he was on death's door. The six month old boy at the centre of the international surrogacy scandal was admitted to hospital south of Bangkok late last week with a suspected heart defect and trouble breathing after his surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua rushed him to hospital. Baby Gammy, who has Down syndrome, does not have a heart condition, Thai doctors have confirmed . He was treated for pneumonia and a cardiologist examined his heart but on Wednesday gave the little boy a clean bill of health. 'At first he was brought to us because he was coughing,' a spokeswoman for the Samitivej Sriracha Hospital told Daily Mail Australia . 'The mother was worried he was going to have heart disease. We examined and he does not, his heart is strong and normal.' The spokeswoman also told the Bangkok Post: 'He has pneumonia which is quite a normal ailment for children of this age,' said Mr Wijit. 'We had a cardiology expert run a check on his heart and we are happy to say he has no heart disease to worry about.' A statement released on Tuesday on behalf of Australian couple Wendy and David Farnell said they were told Gammy, who was born with Down syndrome, was so ill he was not expected to live. They then left Thailand with Gammy's twin sister, fearing political turmoil in the country would prevent them from leaving at all. 'Gammy was very sick when he was born and the biological parents were told he would not survive and he had a day, at best, to live and to say goodbye,' it said. His supposed condition also prompted an outpouring of generosity from around the world, with more than $120,000 raised for his health care.

A 42-year-old Australia Zoo keeper has been taken to hospital after he was bitten on the leg by 10-year-old Sumatran tiger Juma . 'First aid protocol was followed, the same as Australia Zoo renders all staff, and the keeper is going to be fine,' she said. 'Juma the tiger is fine as well.' A Queensland Ambulance spokesman told Daily Mail Australia an ambulance was called to the zoo at 11.46am and the 42-year-old was taken to Nambour Hospital. A Nambour Hospital spokeswoman said he was in a stable condition. In November last year Australia Zoo keeper David Styles, pictured here with a Sumatran tiger named Kaitlyn, suffered puncture wounds to the neck when he was attacked by a tiger . 'He's still in emergency department, still having some tests done,' she said. 'We're not sure if he's going to be admitted at this stage.' It's the second such incident at Australia Zoo in eight months.

"By . Sarah Michael . Police are investigating an incident in which an Adelaide high school student was allegedly tied to a tree and sexually assaulted by a group of boys on school grounds. The female Year Nine student was allegedly filmed on the perpetrators' mobile phones screaming as eight fellow students pulled down their pants and rubbed their genitalia on her. The incident occurred in 2011 but it was not reported to the Education Department or South Australian police until April this year, a department spokeswoman said. Pictures of an alleged incident in which an Adelaide high school student was tied to a tree and sexually assaulted by other students were posted online . The girl's mother told The Advertiser her daughter was taped to a tree and then tied up with a garden hose by another female near the school's staff room before being approached by the other male students. 'My daughter noticed a gang of boys approaching ... she began to ask (the girl) to let her free ... as the boys drew closer they grabbed the hose and sprinkler,' she said. 'By this stage my daughter was screaming and begging (the girl) to untie her; however, the girl chose to laugh at her and do nothing.' Pictures of the alleged incident were also posted online, further adding to the young girl's humiliation. The girl's mother said she noticed her daughter become withdrawn, stressed and depressed in 2011 but sessions with teachers and counsellors failed to help. She added that since the bullies were reported to police this year the girl's Instagram account had been hacked into and the family home and car had been defaced. The incident occurred in 2011 but it was not reported to the Education Department or South Australian police until April this year . The girl has since left the high school. The principal of the school, which cannot be identified, told Daily Mail Australia he could not comment on the incident as it is being investigated by police. Senior Constable Mick Abbott said the matter was an ongoing police inquiry and he could not comment. 'It's been ongoing investigation with the Education Department as well,' he told Daily Mail Australia. An Education Department spokeswoman said the incident was not reported at the time. 'As the matter is now with SA Police, the school has been limited in its involvement,' she said. 'However the school is reviewing its bullying and harassment policies and procedures and has reinforced its practices with staff and students.' The spokeswoman added that the girl's mother has requested that the Education Department's initial focus be on her daughter's education and wellbeing needs. 'While the student had already left the school concerned when the incident was disclosed, counselling was made available to her from the school's counsellor, and this support continues at her new school,' she said.

"By . Candace Sutton . and Sarah Michael . Sydney's Lord Mayor Clover Moore has defended the proposed $3.5m sculpture which has been described as everything from dental floss to a space noodle, saying the 'Cloud Arch' will be an iconic tourist attraction. 'Tim Williams from the Committee for Sydney ... said people will want to make love under it,' Ms Moore Triple M's Grill team. 'When we’ve had the millionth visitor we’ll stop having this conversation.  But I think he [Tim Williams] was making the point that this will put Sydney on the map, another reason for putting Sydney on the map as well as our Harbour Bridge and our Opera House and people will want to come,' she said. 'People will come to see it. People will want to see it and want to be photographed under it. This will put Sydney on the map ... as well as the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House.' Scroll down for video . In the face of widespread ridicule of her proposed $9m sculptures, Clover Moore (pictured, launching the proposal) told Radio MMM people from around the world would flock to Sydney to be photographed under the Cloud Arch which would define the Sydney CBD. MMM's Gus Worland told Ms Moore it was the equivalent of him designing a giant garbage bin for Hyde Park and expecting to be paid millions. Lord Mayor Clover Moore (pictured, left, with supporter, the Museum of Contemporary Art's Elizabeth Ann MacGregor at the sculpture launch) claims the Cloud Arch will lure tourists from around the world who will want to be photographer under it and that it will become as iconic to Sydney as the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House . Sydney is set to get a new Cloud Arch sculpture, designed by Tokyo-based artist Junya Ishigami, which will be erected on George Street near Town Hall . Ms Moore said the sculpture would unify the Sydney CBD's main road, George street, and underscore the city's 'wonderful relationship with the blue sky and the Opera House'. Triple M's Matty Johns and Gus Worland asked Ms Moore whether the City of Sydney's $9 million sculpture proposals, which include not only the Cloud Arch, but 60 bronze birds and a giant blue milk crate in a park,  was the equivalent of them designing a large garbage bin for Hyde Park and demanding it be paid out of taxpayers' money. 'There are economic arguments about art,' Ms Moore said, 'I hope people will respond and this this is a great thing to do to celebrate Sydney. 'What we did wasn't just a matter of Clover Moore saying these are great works. We got some really eminent people from the art world and they decided. [We got] 700 responses from 28 different countries.' Ms Moore said the council's expert art committed had culled the 700 entries down to ten and then selected the milk crate, cloud arch and the birds from those. The release of images of the three finalists has sparked a storm of mockery on social media from people who compared the Cloud Arch to dental floss, a rubber band and Mr Burns from The Simpsons. The City of Sydney plans to install the 50-metre sculpture above George Street, in front of its council chambers in Sydney's Town Hall. The council will spend $9.3 million on the Cloud Arch, designed by Tokyo-based artist Junya Ishigami, and the giant fibreglass milk crate, to be installed near Central Station, as well as a set of 60 bronze bird sculptures which will be perched around the Kent Street underpass. A $2.5m pavilion by Hany Armanious, that has already been dubbed the Milk Crate, will stand in Belmore Park near Central Railway Station . Controversial British artist Tracey Emin has been given the nod to create a $2.1m corridor of bird installations in the area near Wynyard . Twitter users dubbed the Cloud Arch the #spacenoodle and compared the curvy steel sculpture to Jessica Rabbit, dental floss and a rubber band. Others noticed out a likeness to Mr Burns as an alien in the Simpsons, and a giant car yard balloon. But some people on social media were quick to point out that other Australian capital cities have been given much stranger public artworks in the past, such as Canberra's Skywhale or Adelaide's pig and giant ball sculptures. The Cloud Arch sculpture will be built with steel plates to rise diagonally across from the Queen Victoria Building to the Woolworths building. In his artist's statement, Mr Ishigami said the Cloud Arch would evoke 'comfort, openness and freedom' and embodied the characteristics of 'Green, Global and Connected', which is Clover Moore's slogan for what she wants to make Sydney.","Sydney's Lord Mayor has defended the new sculpture proposed for the Sydney CBD .

"By . Sarah Michael . Sarah Smith is brought to tears when she thinks about the moment she will be able to walk beside her son Finn as he holds her hand. In November last year, her then 13-month-old son contracted meningococcal and spent two and a half weeks in a coma fighting for his life. Finn had to have both feet and one of his hands amputated after they were badly affected by bruising. Scroll down for video . Finn Smith, from the Sunshine Coast, contracted meningococcal in November and had to have his two feet and one of his hands amputated . Now that he's 21 months old, his mother Sarah Smith (right) is looking forward to him getting some prosthetic feet so he can learn to walk . Now 21 months old, the Sunshine Coast boy has made a remarkable recovery. The 'happy go lucky' little boy who loves playing outside is due to have surgery Wednesday to release the scars that have closed over his left hand – which will allow him to pick things up on his palm and use his thumb and remaining three fingers. And in three weeks Finn will get a new pair of prosthetic legs and will start learning how to take his first steps. But it has been a long eight months for his parents Sarah and Jason Smith. On the night of November 21, Finn had been up all night with flu-like symptoms and every once in a while he would get the shakes. The couple had an on-call doctor visit at 1am, who diagnosed him with a viral infection and told them to get him antibiotics in the morning. Little Finn pictured (left) before he contracted menigococcal and (right) today at his Queensland home . Finn is a 'happy go lucky' little boy who loves playing, especially outside . The next day during a car trip to Brisbane, they noticed three bruise-like dots on his forehead. They raced to the nearest hospital, which was seven minutes away at Redcliffe, and when they arrived Finn was admitted straight away. 'Within half an hour he was pretty much unrecognisable,' Ms Smith told Daily Mail Australia. Finn was crying tears of blood, blood was coming out of his mouth and his body had puffed up. 'The meningococcal had done its incubation time the night before,' she added. 'You don't know until the spots come out and once the rash comes out the damage is done - your little boy is fighting for his life.' On November 22 last year after he was raced to hospital he was given antibiotics to fight the meningococcal, but all of his internal organs had shut down and he went into a coma for two and a half weeks . When he started showing signs of waking he was slowly weaned off the breathing machines so he could start relying on his own lungs again . Finn was given antibiotics to fight the meningococcal, but all of his internal organs had shut down and he went into a coma for two and a half weeks. When he started showing signs of waking he was slowly weaned off the breathing machines so he could start relying on his own lungs again. But the meningococcal bruising had affected his hands and feet so severely that they needed to be amputated. His first operation happened on Christmas Eve, where his left leg was amputated below the knee. Three days later his right arm was amputated through the wrist. On December 29 he had to have his right leg amputated through the ankle. The meningococcal bruising had affected his hands and feet so severely that he needed to be amputated . His first operation happened on Christmas Eve, where his left leg was amputated below the knee . All together Finn had to spend the next 10 weeks in hospital, in order to build up his strength and muscle again. 'He couldn't sit up or hold his head, he was so weak,' Ms Smith said. When the Smiths were allowed to leave hospital in February they tried to return to as normal a family life as they could. 'He was just so scared and confused when he was at the hospital so we just tried to let him be the normal child and the happy little kid that he is,' Ms Smith said. 'Our life now is different in that we have so much more in our plate in a medical way, but everything else is just play time, we've tried to keep it as normal as possible.' Now Finn loves playing outdoors and going for swimming lessons once a week . Finn is also very protective of his limbs and he 'certainly knows what's missing', Ms Smith said . Ms Smith said Finn is a very independent and playful boy who loves the outdoors, but he's also very protective of his limbs. 'He's very protective of everything now,' she said. 'Although he gets around and he's certainly a happy little boy and has an amazing spirit, he certainly knows what's missing. 'He's OK with us to touch him and put his socks on but he doesn't allow strangers to touch him.' On Wednesday Finn will have another operation on his left hand to release some of the scars. He lost his index finger but he still has most of his thumb and the stumps of his middle, ring and pinky finger. 'That will allow him to have movement in the little fingers and allow the palm to be flattened out and be able to pick thinks up properly, and he'll also have a skin graft on back of his wrist.' On Wednesday Finn will have another operation on his left hand to release some of the scars . After his operation, the family will start looking forward to Finn getting new legs . Ms Smith is dreading taking Finn back to hospital because it brings back awful memories. 'I'm not looking forward to it, we've been home since February and he's sort of been getting around and doing his thing,' she said. 'Going back to hospital and the theatre, it's hard to have to do it to him but it's something obviously we have to do. 'We'll just work through it one day at a time.' After his operation, the family will start looking forward to Finn getting new legs. The 21-month-old has been learning to stand using a pair of cylindrical stump-like boots, but he wasn't ready to start walking with them. 'These new ones are actually going to have feet and we are going to get him a walking frame so he can stand up and walk around.' Ms Smith said the emotions surrounding what has happened to Finn are still very raw for her and Mr Smith . But Ms Smith said she has been absolutely blown away by the support her family has received from the Sunshine Coast community . New feet will greatly improve quality of life for Finn, who loves playing outside. 'He's an outdoors kids, he just loves being outdoors,' she said. 'Just like any other boy he likes to crawl around in the dirt and he loves playing with our black Labrador, that's his best buddy.' Finn also loves to go swimming once a week. 'He's just a real happy go lucky sort of boy, he just loves life,' Ms Smith said. Ms Smith said the emotions surrounding what has happened to Finn are still very raw for her and Mr Smith. Now Ms Smith is focussed on getting Finn through his hand surgery, and then helping him learn to walk . The disease is any infection caused by meningococcal bacteria . Meningococcal bacteria can cause meningitis, an infection of the membranes covering the spinal cord and brain, and septicaemia, an infection in the bloodstream . The infection can develop quickly and lead to serious illness or even death . Early diagnosis and emergency treatment with antibiotics are vital . Immunisation is available for some strains of meningococcal bacteria . Meningococcal bacteria are difficult to spread and only passed from person to person by regular and intimate contact with infected secretions from the back of the nose and throat . Symptoms include rash of purple or red pinprick spots or larger bruises . 'It's still a sore subject but we are trying to do our best to accept our little boy and try not to do the parents thing where you're wondering about what he could have done,' she said. 'It's very hard for parents, the grieving process that you go through.' But Ms Smith said she has been absolutely blown away by the support her family has received from the Sunshine Coast community. 'It was really amazing, it just meant so much,' she said, fighting back tears. 'They've done so much fundraising for him, they've sent so many presents. 'It's very touching and it just warms my heart to think about the goodness in people who have never met us before.' Now Ms Smith is focussed on getting Finn through his hand surgery, and then helping him learn to walk.

"By . Sarah Michael . and Sarah Dean . and Aap . Friends and family members of headless torso murder victim George Gerbic received what they thought were emails from him in the months after his charred remains were discovered on a Queensland roadside. George Gerbic, from Tanawha on the Sunshine Coast, was formally identified by police as the victim of the horrific murder earlier this month, almost a year after his remains were first found. In the 10 months following the grisly discovery, emails were allegedly sent from Mr Gerbic's personal account which gave his friends and relatives the impression he was still alive, The Courier-Mail reported. Victim George Gerbic, from Tanawha on the Sunshine Coast, and accused murderer Lindy Williams . Ms Williams, who lived with Mr Gerbic in the Tanawha home, faced Maroochydore Magistrates Court on July 18 charged with his murder . Police discovered Mr Gerbic's headless remains, with arms severed at the elbows and nothing left below the rib cage, at Cedar Point, near Gympie, last September. A 56-year-old named Lindy Yvonne Williams, who lived with Mr Gerbic in the Tanawha home, faced Maroochydore Magistrates Court on July 18 charged with his murder. She is also charged with interfering with a corpse. Their home was turned into a crime scene on July 17 - the same day police said they had identified the man and were questioning a woman. Ms Williams did not apply for bail and is due to appear again in court for a committal mention on September 1. The torso, found on Cedar Pocket Rd, pictured, in September 2013, was able to be identified when police found the the hypertension drug Irbesartan and Quinine in the body's system . Queensland police have been investigating the murder since last September . Detective Inspector Bruce McNab revealed a small trace of blood pressure medication in the remains had led to the identification of Mr Gerbic. In April police revealed they had detected traces of a drug called Irbesartan in the remains. Doorknocking of prescription users in the area - following an exhaustive search of pharmacy records - had led police to the man's property.' There's been a lot of technology used but also a lot of good old-fashioned detective work, wearing out your shoe leather,' Det Insp McNab said. Crime scene: The area pictured, is where the headless torso was discovered . Tributes have been paid to a 'well liked and much respected' former president of Coolum Football Club. A tribute statement to the 66-year-old read: 'As a club and for those of us who knew him individually, we are incredibly sorry to hear of his tragic death and our hearts and deepest condolences are with his family and close friends at this sad time.

Ms Atkinson labelled the man a 'grub' and sent the pictures to the local council and community watch as well as sharing them on social media. 'PLEASE SHARE AND SHAME!! While I was visiting Gladstone QLD we were at Awoonga Dam taking pics when I realized I had taken a photo of a man standing on his water plane PISSING IN THE DRINKING WATER,' she wrote on her Facebook page. Australia by Seaplane chief pilot Vance Krahenbring said he had launched an internal company investigation, and added the pilot would be disciplined, the Gladstone Observer reported. Gladstone Area Water Board chief executive Jim Grayson said the incident would not cause any health issues for the town. 'We think it's poor behaviour but it poses no risk from a point of view of health,' Mr Grayson told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's not great behaviour and we certainly would discourage people from doing that and to use some self-control.' The dam is the main water supply for Gladstone, which has a population of more than 30,000, as well as the nearby town of Calliope . Mr Grayson added the dam was 'very big' so the urine would be diluted and said the water is treated before it is sent to council. 'Raw water out there is treated through a process that removes particles and adds chemicals and produces water that is fit for human consumption and is tested quite extensively,' he said. Lake Awoonga Caravan Park manager Jan Lawlor said there were public toilets the man could have used. 'It's disrespectful to everybody else in the public, basically,' Ms Lawlor told Daily Mail Australia. But Ms Lawlor said she did not think he needed to be disciplined. 'I think he's going to have been embarrassed enough to be honest with you,' she said.

"By . Sarah Michael . and Candace Sutton . and Aap . A Victorian mother whose baby died after being left in a hot car has been cleared of her manslaughter, after evidence given during her trial said she was suffering from 'forgotten baby syndrome'. Five-month-old Bella Poole died from heatstroke when locked in the car on a 30C day after her mother, Jayde Poole, forgot her after a family trip to a Bendigo takeaway shop on December 11, 2012. Ms Poole, 29, was found not guilty in the Victorian Supreme Court on Thursday. During her trial, expert witness Professor David Diamond, a neuroscientist and memory expert from the University of South Florida, claimed she was suffering from forgotten baby syndrome. Scroll down for video . Jayde Poole, pictured outside the Victorian Supreme Court on Thursday, after she was found not guilty of the manslaughter of her five-month-old baby Bella . Ms Poole's five-month-old daughter Bella Poole died from heatstroke when locked in the car on a 30C day in 2012 . But other experts have warned against labelling the phenomenon of parents leaving their children in cars a 'syndrome', and say the term could be seized on in order to 'deflect criminal charges'. On Thursday it was found Ms Poole's forgetfulness did not amount to criminal negligence. Her defence barrister Shane Gardner said she was not a child killer but a well-intentioned mother who had made a mistake. Defence lawyer Shane Gardner said Ms Poole now wanted to be left to grieve her loss. 'There are no winners in a case like this,' he told reporters outside the court in Bendigo. 'Despite a legal win for Jayde today, the fact is she has to live with these consequences for the rest of her life.' Ms Poole put Bella in a baby seat, facing backwards, for the short car ride to Hungry Jacks to pick up a meal for her six-year-old son . Ms Poole forgot Bella was in the car when she locked the door and went inside her house on a 30C day . But what is 'forgotten baby syndrome'? Prof Diamond, who gave evidence in Ms Poole's trial, says it is 'our attempt to try to understand how it is that normal attentive and loving parents forget that their children are in the car with them.' 'So they arrive at their destination and they've completely lost awareness that their child is in the car so they exit the car leaving the child in it,' he told The Today Show on Friday. Professor David Diamond, a neuroscientist and memory expert from the University of South Florida . 'The car heats up and then the child dies of heatstroke.' Prof Diamond said there had been hundreds of cases of forgotten child syndrome documented worldwide. 'The constant factor, the common thread to all these forgotten children is that the parent is involved in some sort of habitual drive that typically does not include the child,' he said. John Dunn, a memory expert from the University of Adelaide, said that it was 'not totally beyond the realm of plausibility' that a parent could forget their child is in a car with them, but he said it was 'drawing a long bow' to call it a syndrome. 'I think there's a tendency to call everything a syndrome,' Prof Dunn told Daily Mail Australia. 'It has that implication that there is some kind of biological defect or cause to it.' Prof Dunn said memory is fallible. 'There are lots of factors that will lead people to forget things even the most important things in our lives like children in back seats,' he said. But Prof Dunn added that the term 'forgotten baby syndrome' makes the incident of a parent forgetting a child in a car sound like it is the result of a mental defect. 'You could imagine that's partly why people are construing it that way, in order to deflect criminal charges,' he said. 'It's a typical ploy that everyone will play some sort of a card that they're suffering from some sort of mental defect. During Ms Poole's trial, expert witness Professor David Diamond claimed she was suffering from forgotten baby syndrome . 'You can always get diverse medical opinion as to what's going on.' Prof Dunn said he believed the term 'forgotten baby syndrome' would only make sense if it was secondary to another problem, such as depression. 'In depression one of the things is that memory suffers, you become preoccupied with your own thoughts, which leads to forgetting things.' Before Jayde Poole's manslaughter trial, she made a formal application for charges against her to be dropped. She tearfully pleaded she had no memory of placing five-month-old Bella in the back seat, and thought originally her daughter had been kidnapped. Ms Poole, an A-grade netball coach, was a single mother before the December day in 2012 when she strapped her five-month-old Bella into a car seat and forgot her in 30-plus degree temperatures. The tragedy unfolded on the evening of December 11, 2012 in Bendigo, where the average temperature during the three hours Bella was strapped in the car topped 30 degrees celsius. Ms Poole had left home in the late afternoon to fetch a Hungry Jacks meal. Normally, she would have left Bella at home with her mother but Bella was grouchy and so Ms Poole put her in the baby seat, facing backwards, for the short car ride. They arrived home at 4.45pm. Ms Poole locked the car with the remote control and carried the drinks into the house. Ms Poole would later say in a police interview she believed she had put Bella down to sleep in a cot. Ms Poole took a cup of tea outside and lit a cigarette to smoke while she telephoned her friend. It was after 6.30pm, and still hot. The two friends chatted about Christmas shopping. The conversation lasted 19 minutes and 44 seconds. Ms Poole then went to check on Bella in her cot in a front room of the house. Neither Bella nor her bottle was in the cot. Ms Poole rang her sister in a panic and told her: 'I put her down for a sleep and she's not there. Someone's taken her.' Ms Poole hung up and rang the Bendigo police to report a child abduction. The police arrived within ten minutes and started searching the house. Ms Poole's brother was the first of several family members to turn up amid flashing blue lights, sirens and confusion among the neighbours who gathered outside the crime scene tape on the street. An officer asked Ms Poole to open her car which was parked not 200 metres from the house. They made the terrible discovery - Bella in her car seat, not moving. Ms Poole broke down, crying and screaming. The baby was taken to hospital where medical staff tried to revive her. It was too late. They declared Bella dead. Dr Mark Putland later told police he believed the child had been dead for some time before reaching hospital. He observed 'bluish purple discolouration' on Bella's back and buttocks, which indicated the child was 'really dead'. A post mortem on Bella discovered traces of morphine. Forensic examiners questioned whether paramedics administered the drug instead of adrenaline. Ms Poole's relatives told police she was a 'loving mum' and her children were 'always dressed well and clean and happy'. Her mother denied she was forgetful, saying she was 'really switched on' and would 'never do anything to hurt her kids'. Over the ensuing year, as the Poole family tried to come to terms with the little girl's death, the Victorian Office of Public Prosecutions mounted a case against Jayde Poole. She was found not guilty of manslaughter in the Victorian Supreme Court on Thursday July 24.","Jayde Poole, 29, from Bendigo has been cleared of manslaughter .

The protesters held up placards in support of a so-called Robin Hood tax . The FTT would place a levy of less than 0.1 per cent on financial transactions. 'It could raise up to $US35 billion dollars, and with at least 10 per cent of this amount we could definitely within 30 years end the transmission of the epidemic,' Ms Baillon said. After the protesters quietened down Clinton paid tribute to MH17 victims, and specifically the six AIDS conference delegates who died on board. 'There's been a lot of understandable honour paid to the colleagues we lost in the airplane crash and I would like to begin by trying to put their lives in the context of this work and the larger struggle abroad in the worlds of AIDS,' he said. 'The loss of our colleagues and more than 290 others in what appears to have been a deliberate act is a stark reflection on the negative forces of our interdependence.' Mr Clinton also paid tribute to Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's efforts to get the UN Security Council to agree on a resolution on the MH17 disaster. Ms Bishop has been widely applauded for her effort in securing the resolution, which also had the support of Russia. Clinton paid tribute to MH17 victims, specifically the six AIDS conference delegates who died on board . 'I was very proud yesterday to be in this country when the Australian foreign minister spoke at the UN,' Mr Clinton said. Mr Clinton said he had also been 'overwhelmed' by the comments of the Dutch foreign minister Frans Timmermans, whose country lost almost 200 people on the downed Malaysia Airlines flight. 'He took my breath away when he speculated what the last moments of those people must have been like,' Mr Clinton said. 'I hope that all of our countries who value freedom and honour will look at the statement ... before they give in to the temptation to say: ""Well, maybe we should weaken our resolve to take a strong stand because after all they didn't mean to shoot this plane down"".' International AIDS Conference spokeswoman Lucy Stackpool-Moore said Mr Clinton's security was made aware of the protest ahead of his speech. 'An engagement with activism is a key part of the conference, it's part of the spirit of the conference and the open dialogue,' Ms Stackpool-Moore told Daily Mail Australia. 'Bill Clinton been a regular guest at these conferences so he's had experience with it in the past.'","AIDS activists fighting for a Robin Hood tax disrupt Bill Clinton address .

"By . Sarah Michael . and Aap . James Packer has hit the red carpet in Hollywood in support of his friend and business partner, Hercules director Brett Ratner. The casino mogul, who with Ratner owns production company RatPac Entertainment, scrubbed up by putting on a pair of aviator sunglasses, a sleek black suit and an open-collared white shirt for the film's premiere. It was a far cry from the baggy pair of dark blue, worn tracksuit bottoms and daggy grey jumper he was seen wearing as he left his upscale hotel in New York two days ago. Scroll down for video . Brett Ratner and James Packer at the premiere of Paramount Pictures' Hercules at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood . Packer cracked a smile and put his hand around Ratner's shoulder as they posed for photos before the screening of the Greek demigod blockbuster starring Dwayne Johnson. Earlier this week Packer and his sister Gretel announced a 10-year, $200 million commitment from the Packer family and Crown Resorts to fund arts, charities and indigenous education. Packer and Ratner formed Rat-Pac Entertainment, which is quickly becoming Hollywood's new power player, in 2012 as an independent film company and the business has since branched out into TV, book publishing, documentaries and a China offshoot. Its first film, the Sandra Bullock-George Clooney space disaster Gravity, won seven Oscars at this year's Academy Awards and earned $US716 million at the global box office. Other films include the Robert De Niro-Sylvester Stallone comedy Grudge Match, Horrible Bosses 2 and the adaptation of the Frankie Valli-Four Seasons Broadway hit Jersey Boys. They recently moved into the office that used to belong to the original king of cool and head of the Rat Pack, Frank Sinatra. Packer and Ratner formed Rat-Pac Entertainment, which is quickly becoming Hollywood's new power player, in 2012 as an independent film company . Packer was seen wearing a baggy pair of dark blue, worn tracksuit bottoms and daggy grey jumper as he left his upscale hotel in New York two days ago . 'There is no brand cooler than RatPac and, by the way, this was all James's idea,' Ratner said. 'He called me up one day and said, ""You're Ratner, I'm Packer. We are the only two people aside from Frank Sinatra that can have a company called RatPac. Ratner and Packer makes sense"".' Ratner, who is known for directing the Rush Hour films, also said the paid 'love making films' and that 'content is king'. The casino mogul scrubbed up by putting on a pair of aviator sunglasses, a sleek black suit and an open-collared white shirt . 'James, as you know, was in the distribution business before with Channel Nine, and now he's out of that, traditional media per se, and we are working really hard at creating great content,' he said. RatPac, along with another mogul, Dune's Steve Mnuchin, have a four-year, $US450 million deal with Warner Bros. to fund as many as 75 of the studio's films. Warner Bros. has also signed a first look deal with RatPac for 32 projects involving Hollywood stars and filmmakers including Eastwood, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon. Packer and Ratner first met when Ratner was in Sydney in 2002 promoting his thriller with Anthony Hopkins, Red Dragon. 'I actually met his wife Erica first when I was doing Red Dragon in Australia,' Ratner said. 'We were premiering the movie there and that's where our friendship started. 'This was before Erica was James's wife. 'It goes back years.' Packer and Ratner, of course, have other business interests. Packer has his multi-billion dollar Crown casino operation and Ratner was in Hungary for four months shooting Hercules. 'I have never seen somebody so committed to something.' Ratner was also impressed with Packer's May street fight with good friend and best man David Gyngell. 'Oh yeah, he can scrap,' Ratner laughed. 'But, Sinatra got into a lot of fights back in the day.' Packer cracked a smile and put his hand around Ratner's shoulder as they posed for photos before the screening of the blockbuster .

"By . Sarah Michael . Women find men who have had five previous partners much less desirable than men who have had one or two . Women are instinctively turned off by men who have had too many or not enough previous partners. The right amount? One or two previous girlfriends, according to researchers from James Cook University. Ryan Anderson and Michele Surbey's study I Want What She's Having - Evidence of Human Mate Copying, published in the journal Human Nature, found that women like men who have been desirable to women in the past. The phenomenon – known as 'mate copying' in the animal world – also exists among humans. The study of university students aged between 17 and 40 found that women found men who had had one or two previous partners in the past four years most desirable. They found men with zero previous partners or one current partner less desirable. 'Our study indicated that women want guys have been to an extent pre-approved,' Mr Anderson said. 'If a guy has been in a relationship with another female it says something about that guy, that he was able to attract this individual and maintain a relationship with her. 'Guys that have been in no relationships might be considered to be creepy or socially inept for whatever reason.' But they found men who had had five previous partners in the past four years were the least desirable by far. 'They might be considered promiscuous or flaky or unwilling to commit,' Mr Anderson said. Respondents in the James Cook University survey were also turned off by men who have had zero previous partners . The 123 respondents, who had an average age of 20, rated the sexual and relationship desirability of average looking photographed men, described as single and pictured alone or with one, two, or five female silhouettes, representing their number of previous relationships. A fifth man was described as currently in a romantic relationship. The study also found that a woman's self-perceived mate value (SMPV), which measures how desirable she thinks she is as a partner, has absolutely no bearing on her likelihood to mate copy. 'We thought that would be associated with mate copying, that woman that thought highly of themselves would be more likely to seek out men who had been pre-approved,' Mr Anderson said. Men who have had too many partners 'might be considered promiscuous or flaky or unwilling to commit,' says study author Ryan Anderson . 'We didn't really find that to be the case.' The study also found that the younger a woman is, the more likely she is to mate copy. 'Young women are looking for additional information, they want to know what other people think of this man before they choose him,' he said. 'Older woman are possibly more confident in their decisions, they don't need to know what other people think.'","Women are turned off by men who have had too many previous partners .

"By . Sarah Michael . A messy legal dispute between lawyer turned jazz singer Sally Street's mother and her estranged husband has left her with no money in the bank and just $3 in her wallet. Following Ms Street's split from high-profile Sydney barrister Alexander 'Sandy' Street, SC last year, Ms Street's mother Helen Jenifer McDonald and her ex-husband have become embroiled in a legal battle over a disputed loan worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mr Street is the son of former NSW Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street, and his grandfather and great-grandfather were also NSW Chief Justices. Scroll down for video . Sally Street left a high-flying career as a lawyer to pursue her dream of being a jazz musician . In the mid-2000s Ms Street was a senior associate at a top Sydney law firm specialising in private equity . Ms McDonald is suing Mr Street for $836,989.39 plus damages over loans she says she made to him to help him pay the mortgage on his Vaucluse home, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Ms Street says she is joined on the claim against her estranged husband 'as a matter of procedure' but insists that her mother is not suing her to force her to pay up. Appearing in court yesterday, Ms Street said she could not afford a lawyer and told Justice Peter Hamill she had zero dollars in the bank. 'I went and hawked a ring after the court proceedings,' Ms Street told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Street's estranged husband is being forced to sell his share in his barristers chambers in order to pay more than $500,000 he owes Ms Street's mother Helen Jenifer McDonald and a $230,000 tax bill. Alexander 'Sandy' Street and his father, former NSW Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street . The NSW Supreme court ordered Mr Street to pay Ms McDonald $540,729.92 in May. On Tuesday Mr Street asked the court to stay a garnishee order which currently sees all his income paid to Ms McDonald, arguing he could not afford his repayments to the ATO, $1300 per month maintenance payments to Ms Street and his own living costs. Justice Peter Hamill agreed to stay the order until August 27, provided 50 per cent of his income goes to the ATO and his child support payments are covered. The remaining money is to be split 70:30 between Ms McDonald and Mr Street. In court on Tuesday Ms Street said she had been told her husband intends to stop paying maintenance payments to cover rent and bills when their divorce is finalised next month. Ms Street's estanged husband and mother are involved in a messy legal battle . Ms Street used to be half one of the Sydney law community's most high-profile couples, before her split from estranged husband Alexander 'Sandy' Street, SC, in September last year . 'Which mean I'll be out on the streets,' Ms Street told Justice Hamill. 'I have zero dollars in my bank account; I have $3 in my wallet.' Ms Street also said she could not afford a lawyer. Justice Hamill made a recommendation to the NSW Bar Association to provide her with legal advice. Ms Street – a former lawyer turned jazz and pop musician – said she did not know anything about litigation because when she practiced she was a mergers and acquisitions lawyer. She officially left the profession in 2007. Ms Street said she believed the judge's decision yesterday was 'unfair' because she was not allowed to sit in on negations which she said 'documents without any doubt affected my legal rights'. Ms Street's estranged husband is being forced to sell his share in his barristers chambers in order to pay more than $500,000 he owes Ms Street's mother Helen Jenifer McDonald . In the mid-2000s Ms Street was a senior associate at a top Sydney law firm specialising in private equity . 'They covered my child maintenance but completely disregarded any rent or bills,' she said. 'It's my livelihood that I have a roof over my head but I wasn't allowed to participate.' In the mid-2000s Ms Street was a senior associate at a top Sydney law firm specialising in private equity, working for clients such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. But her high-flying legal career is worlds away from her new occupation as a jazz and pop singer, which sees her playing regular live gigs in Sydney nightspots and singing 'flirty' songs on stage with her diamante-encrusted keytar.","Sally Street split from high-profile barrister 'Sandy' Street last year .

"By . Sarah Michael . When first-time mother Kirra Givanni fell pregnant at 39 she was determined to give birth without drugs. The practicing Tibetan Buddhist, from Vaucluse in Sydney's eastern suburbs, is so anti-drugs she doesn't even take Panadol, but when she told doctors she wanted to give birth naturally they laughed in her face. Ms Givanni, now 40, defied doctors' expectations and had her daughter Tara in what she describes as an enjoyable, drug-free experience. Kirra Givanni was attacked on Facebook after she shared her story about having a drug-free birth at 40 . Ms Givanni was laughed at by doctors when she told them she wanted to giver birth to daughter Tara (now seven and a half months old) completely naturally . But when she took to mothers' group Facebook page Bondi Babies to share her story she was attacked by other members, and the comments got so vicious her post was deleted. 'Ladies became very upset with me and wrote that I was shaming them, I was bragging also that I should think before I post because I was being very insensitive,' Ms Givanni told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Givanni said she wrote the post because she wanted to share something positive about birth. 'Because there's so much negativity, no one ever writes anything happy about birth,' she said. 'People who have horrible experiences they're allowed to talk about theirs and no one gets upset'. 'I posted it because I wanted to write something positive and draw out ladies with similar experiences, I wanted to bond with them.' Ms Givanni, from Vaucluse, said she wanted to write something positive about birth and bond with ladies who had similar experiences . She also wanted to point out that doctors aren't always right. 'A lot of the doctors told me there's no way possible I'd have a natural birth at my age,' she said. 'There's a lot of negativity, but it is possible that you can have a good pregnancy and good birth. I had the best birth and left hospital the next day.' Ms Givanni believes there was nothing inflammatory about what she wrote. 'Basically I wrote women have been having babies for a long time naturally without drugs, and at my age doctors told me that I couldn't do it, that it would almost be impossible,' she said. 'Then I wrote ""I loved giving birth has anyone else experienced this?"" 'People were angry… They said it was the way I wrote it.' Ms Givanni was accused of bragging but she says she was not hurt by any of the comments and she is just disappointed the post was removed from Facebook . Ms Givanni said no one made comments about her age and rather everyone seemed to be angry about the fact she said her birth was drug-free. 'In general people just don't know how to be happy for other people. They told me to not write it because what about the people who have experienced a difficult birth?' she said. 'In general society doesn't know how to rejoice for people having a good experience'. 'Does that mean you can't talk about anything good without upsetting everyone?' Ms Givanni added that she was not hurt by any of the comments and she is just disappointed the post was removed. 'I wasn't upset by anything anyone wrote. [The page moderator] said there were some inappropriate comments but I didn't find it inappropriate. Why didn't they just delete those comments?' she said. 'I'm not offended, I'm thick-skinned and I believe in free speech, people can write what they want.' Ms Givanni, a practicing Tibetan Buddhist, met the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India when she was nine weeks pregnant . Ms Givanni's daughter Tara Tenzin Drolma was named by the Dalai Lama while she was still in the womb. She is pictured with the Dalai Lama when he visited Sydney . After the post was taken down an admin for the page sent Ms Givanni a message explaining what had happened. 'Hi Kirra, I am part of the Admin team for BB, and as you are aware your post today has created quite a stir,' she wrote. 'The admin team have actually made a decision to remove the post permanently. It has nothing to do with your original post, but some of the comments are just inappropriate and not useful (& we have also received many PMs about it today). 'I hope you understand! Please don't take this is a criticism of you in any way at all!' Marietta David, who created the Bondi Babies Facebook page but does not manage it, said the group had grown to be almost 4000 members and she said as it gets bigger, the community is becoming more hostile. 'When things do get nasty as a moderator sometimes the best thing you can do is take the thing down,' Ms David told Daily Mail Australia. 'If things get nasty you sometimes just want to stop the hostility or aggression… It just starts to feed on itself.'","Kirra Givanni, 40, from Vaucluse in Sydney, gave birth naturally .

"By . Sarah Michael . A Sydney man is suing the Australian Tax Office for $5.8 million after a seven-year battle over an audit he says has destroyed his life. Gary Kurzer, 62, from Bondi says he lost his business, defaulted on his mortgage, suffered mental health problems and split from his partner of 28 years due to his legal fight against the ATO over a bungled tax bill. The audit began in December 2007 after he and his former partner sold two rental properties they owned in Terrigal, and the ATO claimed they owed $200,000 in GST plus tax on 'a $667,000 profit'. Gary Kurzer, 62, from Bondi is suing the ATO for $5.8 million . 'In fact we'd actually made losses on the sale - we lost money we didn't make money,' Mr Kurzer told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Kurzer said his tax bill was eventually revised down to just over $8,000 following objections, appeals, an appearance at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in 2010 and an admittance from the ATO that it had issued 'contradictory and unsustainable objections decisions'. Following the AAT decision which found the couple did not owe GST or tax, Mr Kurzer claims the ATO again began pursuing him for amounts of up to $230,000. 'This is the situation that taxpayers like myself find we have to battle for anything up to seven years,' he said. 'Unfortunately in that process you lose everything.' The former architect is now suing the tax office for misfeasance and will represent himself in the NSW Federal Court on September 22. In its legal defence, the Tax Office said it did not owe Mr Kurzer duty of care, The Canberra Times reported. Mr Kurzer says he lost his business, defaulted on his mortgage, suffered mental health problems and split from his partner due to his legal fight against the ATO over a bungled tax bill . The case comes as the ATO has been under fire has come under fire for the way it handles taxpayer disputes following a report from the Inspector General of Taxation published last week. The report found that about one third of the $4.25 billion in penalties imposed by the tax office in the past three years had been unfair and subsequently reduced. Mr Kurzer has rejected a settlement offer from the ATO, because he wants to take a stand against their 'incompetence and bullying'. 'I personally am now at retirement age and I find myself destitute as a result of this and I think that's pretty unfair given it was their mistake,' he said. 'This kind of collateral damage is happening every day.' An ATO spokesman told the Daily Mail Australia he could not comment on the case as it is before the court.","Gary Kurzer, 62, from Bondi is suing the Australian Tax Office for $5.8m .

"By . Sarah Michael . New technology that tracks the details of every person who illegally downloads a file could wipe out video and music piracy, researchers say. Experts from Australia's Deakin University and Japan's Aizu University created the breakthrough watermarking technology which leaves a trail identifying every user who has illegally distributed a file. Lead researcher on the project, Deakin University's Yong Xiang, said unlike previous watermarks his do not compromise the quality of the original audio. Scroll down for video . Bruno Mars (left) and Rihanna (right) were the most illegally downloaded musicians of 2013. Australian researchers say new technology could wipe out music and video piracy . His new technology is also unable to be tampered with, unlike previous versions which allowed watermarks to be tampered with when people edited audio files. The improved watermarks would enable music distributors to identify the source of leaked contents and pass them onto police, providing irrefutable evidence of content misuse in support of legal action. 'What we did was to enable music file owners and relevant law enforcement authorities to use a secret key to extract the watermark data from the watermarked multimedia object,' he said. 'Watermarking technology can be used to prove copyright ownership, trace the source of illegal distribution and verify the authenticity of files.' Globally, 95 per cent of music downloads are illegal. In Australia, around 2.8 million people download music illegally via file sharing networks. Wanlei Zhou, head of the School of IT at Deakin, said the technology could also be used to stop TV and movie piracy. The technology could also be used to stop TV and movie piracy. Australians led the world in the illegal downloading of season four of TV show Game Of Thrones (pictured is character Jon Snow) 'We only did this for audio, but anything you do for audio you can apply to video,' Prof Zhou told Daily Mail Australia. The watermark technology works by embedding details of the recipient of the audio file, such as their IP address and credit card and bank information. Every time the file is passed on, the technology records the details of the downloader. Prof Xiang said previous watermarking technology affected the quality of files but his new development did not. He added that older watermarks were able to be tampered with, both maliciously and unintentionally, which meant music distributors and police could not properly extract data. Malicious attacks came from people who intentionally modified the watermark data. Unintentional attacks, which happen when people copy songs, add special effects or convert files into MP3 and JPEG, also change watermark data. Sia and Ed Sheeran's albums are in the top three on the (legally downloaded) Australian iTunes charts . The researchers compared their new technology with the five best watermarking programs on the market and found that theirs was the most effective after audio files had been altered. Using their program they were able to detect 100 per cent of watermarks, while the other programs detected between 40 and 90 per cent. Music Rights Australia general manager Vanessa Hutley said she welcomed advancements which sought to address the issue of online infringement. But Ms Hutley added that there was 'no silver bullet' when it came to wiping out piracy and said she was unable to comment on the particular technology until she had seen how it worked. 'The issue of online infringement is a complex one and requires multiple strategies,' she said. 'We have advocated for improved legislative processes which would allow rights holders to take effective, efficient and proportionate steps to stop those who exploit their creative content without rewarding them.'","New technology could wipe out video and music piracy, researchers say .

"By . Sarah Michael . and Aap . Governor of the Reserve Bank Glenn Stevens cautioned investors against assuming housing prices will always rise . It is cheaper to rent than it is to buy the home you live in, new research from the Reserve Bank of Australia suggests. The RBA report titled Is Housing Overvalued? finds that if house price growth slows - as many experts suggest it will – the average household will be better off renting. Researchers Ryan Fox and Peter Tulip compared the financial cost of renting a home with the cost of owning a similar dwelling, taking into account the purchase price, interest rates, repairs and council rates. The report found that real house prices have increased at an average annual rate of slightly less than 2.5 per cent since 1955. If house prices continue to grow at this level, they found that the cost of owning a home would be the same as renting. 'If this rate of appreciation is expected to continue then our estimates suggest that houses are fairly valued,' Mr Fox and Mr Tulip wrote. 'However, many (though not all) forecasters believe that house prices are likely to grow at a somewhat slower rate in the future.' Scroll down for video . If house prices continue to grow at the average rate from past 10 years (1.7 per cent) the cost of owning a property would be 19 per cent greater than the cost of renting . The report found that real house prices have increased at an average annual rate of slightly less than 2.5 per cent since 1955 . They then looked at the average rate house prices have risen over the past 10 years (1.7 per cent). If house prices continue to grow at this level, the cost of owning a property would be 19 per cent greater than the cost of renting. This comes after RBA governor Glenn Stevens this month cautioned investors against assuming housing prices will always rise. In a speech to a conference of economists in Hobart on July 3, the RBA governor said some recovery in housing prices after falls from 2010 to 2012 was no particular cause for concern. But it would be a different matter if there were to be a further run-up in prices combined with 'over-confident expectations of continuing gains' and significant increases in household debt. Growth in the amount of debt owed by households is currently running at six to seven per cent per annum, only slightly above the growth rate of national income, he said. 'It's hard to mount the soap box to complain about that pace.' This home in Mascot in Sydney's south-east was expected to be auctioned off for at least $1,089,000 . Still he warned investors to 'take care' in the Sydney market, where most of the big rises in borrowing had been seen. He warned banks to maintain strong lending standards. And he warned that in making their financing and investment decisions, people should not assume that prices always rise. 'They don't; sometimes they fall,' he said.","If house price growth slows the average home will be better off renting .

A long time friend and business partner of the children's grandfather, Dave Goddard, paid tribute to his friend who he described as 'a man with a passion for family' Evie and Otis had been on holiday in Europe and were among the 298 people on board the Malaysia Airlines plane . The company worked to establish 'opportunity and responsibility' in Aboriginal communities with a programme they called 'Walking Together'. 'He was a very gregarious man, a great enthusiast with a real desire to help people take responsibility,' Mr Goddard said. 'I will miss him.' 'Dear friends please pray for my most beautiful dearest girlfriend and her family after their loss this morning xxx may God be with you xxx love you guys so much - my love to all of you,' Bec Bucci - a friend of the family - posted on Facebook. Mr Norris, the managing director of management consulting firm Collaborative Systemic Change Pty Ltd, is survived by his son Brack, who is the company's marketing manager, and daughter Kirstin, a marine engineer with the Royal Australian Navy. He was a well-known member of the South Perth Yacht Club. The Boeing 777 aircraft was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a sophisticated surface-to-air missile over territory near Donetsk held by pro-Russian rebels who the Ukrainian government says are backed by the Kremlin. 10-year-old Evie, left, and 12-year-old Mo, right, were on flight MH17 when it was shot down over the Russian-Ukraine border . The plane was shot down in an 'act of terrorism', killing all 298 passengers and crew on board including 28 Australians. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed Ukraine for the tragedy. Malaysia Airlines has confirmed that 154 Dutch, 43 Malaysian (including 15 crew and two infants), 12 Indonesian, nine British, four German, three Filipino, and one Canadian citizen were also on the plane. The airline added that all European flights operated by Malaysia Airlines will now be taking alternative routes, avoiding the usual route over Ukraine.","Perth man Nick Norris and his grandchildren Mo, 12, Evie, 10, and Otis Maslin, eight, were on the Malaysia Airlines plane .

The Australian soldier who died after falling down a crevasse while leading a training exercise on New Zealand's highest mountain has been identified as Sergeant Gary Francis. The 44-year-old had climbed Mount Everest twice and was an expert in mountaineering and mountain warfare, news.com.au reported. He fell down a 40-metre crevasse on the Grand Plateau on Aoraki Mt Cook on the South Island and was unable to be revived, local police confirmed. Scroll down for video . The Australian soldier who died after falling down a crevasse during a training exercise on New Zealand's highest mountain has been identified as Sergeant Gary Francis . The 44-year-old had climbed Mount Everest twice and was an expert in mountaineering and mountain warfare . The Australian Department of Defence said Sergeant Francis was from the Sydney-based 2nd Commando Regiment. A former commando described him as the 'Yoda of climbing'. 'He's summited Mount Everest twice and has a world record for the highest rescue in history,' he told News Corp. Sergeant Francis showed his love of the outdoors in a YouTube video he posted of his 2013 highlights, during which he skied in Japan, went climbing in the Blue Mountains and went dirt biking in Louee, NSW. He was a father of two and his wife was in Scotland yesterday, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. The Australian Army members were conducting a two week mountain and cold weather operations training activity in New Zealand, a defence spokesman said. 'No other Army members were injured and the training was immediately suspended,' he said. An Australai soldier has died on Aoraki Mount Cook in New Zealand which is 3754 metres high . 'The soldier was recovered by his colleagues who administered first aid. Sadly, they were unable to revive him and the New Zealand emergency services later declared the soldier deceased.' Defence said the soldier was highly qualified and experienced in alpine, mountain and altitude activities. Defence is providing Sergeant Francis’ family with support. He was one of a party of ten people, NZ police said. The matter has been referred to the Coroner. Alpine Guides manager Arthur McBride told AAP accidents like this happened occasionally on the mountain, but occurred anywhere there was crevasse terrain. Mr McBride said crevasses could be invisible if snow fell over them, but if people were roped to each other they would usually be safe. He said the accident was unrelated to the rock avalanche on the other side of the mountain on Tuesday. At 3724 metres, Mt Cook is New Zealand's tallest mountain.","Sergeant Gary Francis fell down a crevasse on Aoraki Mt Cook yesterday .

"By . Sarah Michael . and Sarah Dean . A young dance troupe were stranded on a hot plane on the tarmac for hours and eventually forced to sleep in a storeroom by hotel staff after their Qantas flight from Los Angeles to Sydney was delayed. Dance teacher Marianne Howard and the 19 performers she is chaperoning, aged 12-21, were subjected to a long ordeal which saw them stuck on a plane at LAX airport with no food, water or air con before being told their flight was cancelled, she has claimed. The dance troupe from Village Performing Arts Centre in Sydney had been on a three-week trip to New York with Miss Universe runner up Briden Starr, 22, who was not on the flight back to Australia on Monday. Their nightmare journey began when their first connecting plane - from NY to LA - was delayed over a fuel issue. 'We got on the plane in New York and had problems - the plane was so ridiculously old,’ Ms Howard told MailOnline. Stranded: 19 teenage dancers from Sydney were left with nowhere to sleep after their Qantas flight home was cancelled . 'It took ages for them to refuel,' she added. When they eventually arrived at LA airport at 10pm they couldn't board their next flight back home to Sydney until 3am. 'They kept saying to us we're having problems we’re trying to fix it,' Ms Howard said. 'These things happen and I'm a really reasonable person but the treatment of us has just been disgusting, absolutely disgusting,' the angry teacher added. Once they finally boarded the plane at LA they had to wait for another three hours on the tarmac with 'no food and water' before being told the flight was cancelled. The troupe had been on a three-week trip to New York with Miss Universe runner up Briden Starr (pictured), 22, who was not on the flight back to Australia . Deserted: Dance teacher Marianne Howard and the performers she is chaperoning were subjected to a long ordeal which saw them stuck on a plane with no food, water or air con before being told their flight was cancelled, she has claimed . 'We sat on the plane down the back with no air con, we were absolutely cooking… my 12 year old daughter was in tears we were so hot,' Ms Howard explained. Then their journey from hell got even worse. 'When they finally announced close to 6am that the flight was cancelled we lined up for ages to get booked on another flight…. We then all got put into hotels,' she said. The 19 dancers were taken to a hotel in Santa Monica but when they arrived at 6.30am Qantas allegedly hadn't booked or paid for their rooms. 'We get to our hotel by this stage we are all really hungry. We hadn't had dinner and it's after 6am in the morning. 'The hotel there said ""we’re really sorry we haven’t received an email from Qantas making payments"". 'By this stage I had kids in tears - they were so tired and hungry,’ she explained. 'I asked “Who can we call?” and they said “I don’t know we don’t have a number”.’ Ms Howard complained: ‘They just shuttled us dropped off in the hotel, I didn’t even know who to call we were just shuttled here. ‘ . Bed for three hours: Ms Howard explained how the dancers were all students and didn't have any money and were taken to a storeroom to sleep . The dancers didn’t have a room at first but the hotel staff said they weren’t allowed to sleep in the lobby. 'In the foyer the kids all started falling asleep. Then a man came over and said “Sorry guys but you’re messing up my foyer you’re not allowed to sleep here. If anyone falls asleep I’ll order a shuttle back to the airport”,’ she said. The group were taken to a storeroom to sleep by the hotel staff member. 'It was like where they store tables and chairs for functions – there was no light. We were in that room for three hours,’ she added. 'We said “Please we are hungry can we get cups of tea”. They said “no you can purchase water if you like”,’ she claimed. Ms Howard explained how the dancers were all students and didn’t have any money. It was about 9am when Qantas finally paid and they were given rooms. Tired and hungry, they were given $16 breakfast vouchers for the buffet which actually cost $19.50 – in the end they decided to just eat anyway. On Monday evening, they were taken from the hotel to the airport by a shuttle at about 7pm and at last boarded their plane back to Sydney at about 10.30pm LA time. 'It’s just been fight after fight after fight. I did not speak to anyone from Qantas the entire time. I left messages. I said I needed to speak to someone urgently. The hotel said someone would call me back and to wait in the room,’ Ms Howard said. A Qantas spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Our staff on the ground work hard to minimise the impact of significant delays. This means organising food, transport and accommodation for hundreds of passengers at the last minute. 'In this instance the delay happened at 3am, so that made alternative arrangements challenging. 'We understand as a result that some passengers had a less than satisfactory experience getting from the airport to their accommodation. 'We regret the discomfort and inconvenience caused and have apologised directly to the group affected.' It is understood a small number of passengers reached their hotels ahead of their booking requests and experienced a delay in getting rooms allocated. MailOnline has attempted to contact the hotel for comment but they were unable to speak at the time and said they were not aware of any incident.","Dance teacher Marianne Howard was chaperoning 19 dancers aged 12-21 .

"By . Sarah Michael . A teenage girl who suffered a potentially fatal allergic reaction to medication was sent home from the hospital three days in a row before she was properly diagnosed. On her 19th birthday Danika Heron noticed a small rash on her chest which quickly started spreading across her entire body. Over four days her symptoms got progressively more severe and she was eventually diagnosed with a life-threatening skin condition, admitted to hospital and wrapped in bandages from head-to-toe. Danika Heron, 19, was bandaged from head-to-toe in silver dressing after suffering a severe allergic reaction to medication . On Thursday May 29 Miss Heron, who recently moved to Sydney from Nowra on the NSW south coast to start a chef apprenticeship, went to a hospital in the northwest to show them her rash  but was told she most likely had gastro and was sent home. The next day the rash was still spreading and started blistering. Her eyes also became swollen and red so she went back to the same hospital but was sent home again. 'They kept on giving me different diagnoses, first they said I had herpes and gastro, second they said it was foot and mouth disease, measles and chicken pox,' Miss Heron told Daily Mail Australia. Miss Heron, who was diagnosed with epilepsy shortly after her 18th birthday, recently started taking new medication. 'I was telling them I'd just started new medication but they weren't listening,' she said. By Saturday her lips were ulcerated and she couldn't open them because they kept sticking together. Miss Heron (pictured left before the reaction and right in hospital) was sent home from the hospital three days in a row before she was properly diagnosed . 'I got annoyed and very upset so I ended up getting mum and dad to come pick me up,' Miss Heron said. Her mother Carmen Heron, who lives in North Nowra, said she was terrified so she raced up to Sydney to check on her daughter. 'She was a mess, she had swollen eyes, fluid coming out of her eyes, swollen lips with blisters and blisters all over her body,' she said. 'I knew she was having an allergic reaction so I told her get off her medication.' Mrs Heron took Miss Heron to a hospital in Nowra where she was diagnosed with the potentially fatal Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but was again sent home. She does not wish to name the hospital as she is pursuing a formal complaint. On her 19th birthday Danika Heron noticed a small rash on her chest which quickly started spreading across her entire body . 'It's not normal, there's a very real threat you can die from it. It's a life threatening syndrome, she shouldn't have been sent home,' Mrs Heron said. 'I was angry that it was taking so long and that she was diagnosed with something and sent home too.' On Sunday Miss Heron went back to hospital because she couldn't breathe or swallow anything. An ICU doctor who was in the emergency ward saw her and realised straight away how serious her condition was, and organised for her to be transported by ambulance to Concord Hospital in Sydney more than two hours away. Her symptoms got progressively worse, and by Saturday her lips were ulcerated and she couldn't open them because they kept sticking together . 'By the time I got transferred up to the other hospital the doctors up there did biopsies and found I had toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN],' Miss Heron said. Dr Saxon Smith, dermatologist and president of the NSW chapter of the Australian Medical Association, said 30 per cent of patients who contract TEN die. Dr Smith told Daily Mail Australia it is a more severe version of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and that it affects about one in 500,000 people each year. He added that about 90 per cent of cases are caused by reactions to medication, but it can also be caused by viral and other infections. Miss Heron was bandaged from head-to-toe in silver dressing and was in hospital for three weeks. 'I was treated like a burns patient,' she said. Miss Heron was diagnosed with toxic epidermal necrolysis, a potentially fatal skin condition . It is now six weeks after she first went to hospital and she is living with her parents and recovering slowly. She needs to get her eyes tested every two weeks because there is a chance she may go blind. Miss Heron is also still losing fingernails, suffering joint pains and has scarring that needs to heal. 'It scares me still because I didn't realise how bad it was until I looked at photos,' she said. 'I'm just glad I'm home, down here to have a month off work, then I'll be going back up to Sydney to start work again.' It is now six weeks after she first went to hospital and Miss Heron (pictured today) is recovering slowly .","Danika Heron, 19, from Nowra, suffered a potentially fatal allergic reaction .

"By . Sarah Michael . and Aap . A Sydney judge, who said incest was becoming more socially acceptable, has been stepped down until an investigation into his comments is complete. Judge Garry Neilson, aged in his 60s, has come under fire after saying the community may no longer see sexual contact between siblings and between adults and children as 'unnatural' or 'taboo', just as homosexuality is now widely accepted. The comments were made while he was presiding over a case of a woman who had allegedly been sexually abused by her older brother when she was 10 and 18 years old. Judge Neilson said the abuse she suffered as an adult did not need to be considered in relation to the abuse she suffered as a child because by that time she had been 'sexually awoken', the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Judge Garry Neilson will not take on any new court cases while his comments are being investigated . Late on Friday, Chief Judge of the District Court Justice Reg Blanch made the announcement that Justice Neilson would not be taking on any more cases. 'I have now been advised by the Attorney-General that he has referred the matter to the Judicial Commission and Judge Neilson will not sit in crime until this matter is determined,' he said in a statement. Justice Blanch said no further comment would be made on the matter. Judicial commission members will examine the complaint before potentially referring it on to the conduct division. They decide whether a complaint justifies the removal of a judicial officer. Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnston has sent letters to the Attorney General and the Chief Justice of NSW calling for Judge Neilson's sacking and demanding a review of all the decisions he has made . If they determine Judge Neilson should be sacked, he would become the first judicial judge to be sacked by parliament, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Earlier on Friday, NSW Attorney-General Brad Hazzard asked Justice Blanch to prevent Judge Neilson presiding over criminal trials while he was investigated by the judicial commission. 'With that context I was extremely concerned to read the comments of His Honour Judge Garry Neilson in regard to his views on incest,' Mr Hazzard said in a statement. 'In my view, the community would be rightly appalled at his reported comments. 'Incest is completely reprehensible, unacceptable, disgusting and criminal.' But Judge Neilson defended his comments to Daily Mail Australia: 'My comments were taken completely out of context, I think it's a fabrication'. Judge Neilson made the comments in the case of a 58-year-old western Sydney man who is charged with repeatedly sexually abusing his younger sister at the family home in 1981. He said that just as community attitudes towards homosexuality had changed since the 1950s and 1960s: 'a jury might find nothing untoward in the advance of a brother towards his sister once she had sexually matured, had sexual relationships with other men and was now ""available"", not having [a] sexual partner'. Judge Neilson also said: 'If this was the 50s and you had a jury of 12 men there, which is what you'd invariably have, they would say it's unnatural for a man to be interested in another man or a man being interested in a boy. Those things have gone.' The 58-year-old man had previously pleaded guilty to raping his sister when she was 10 or 11 years old in the 1970s. But he pleaded not guilty to the charge of sexual intercourse without consent, with an alternative charge of incest, relating to the events in 1981. NSW Attorney General Brad Hazzard has asked the chief judge of the district court Justice Reg Blanch to prevent Judge Neilson presiding over criminal trials . On April 7, the Crown Prosecutor requested the jury be told of his previous convictions, arguing that without this knowledge jurors may struggle to understand that the man had a tendency to be sexually attracted to his sister and may also question why she never told other family members of the abuse. But Judge Neilson refused, saying the abuse she suffered as an adult did not need to be considered in relation to the abuse she suffered as a child. 'By that stage they are both mature adults. The complainant has been sexually awoken, shall we say, by having two relationships with men and she had become 'free' when the second relationship broke down,' Judge Neilson said. Judge Neilson also suggested the only reason incest was still a crime was because to 'prevent chromosomal abnormalities', but said that has become less relevant because of the availability of contraception and abortion. Adults Surviving Child Abuse president Dr Cathy Kezelman said Judge Neilson's comments were 'disgraceful' It has also emerged that in November 2011 Judge Neilson gave a man who raped his niece when she was 15 and 16 a shorter sentence because 'there was no rough handling involved' and he did not ejaculate. The case concerned a 55-year-old man who indecently assaulted his niece multiple times in her bedroom in 2007 and 2008. The man was in a de facto relationship with the victim's mother and lived in the same home. In considering the most serious offence, 'when penile/vaginal intercourse occurred without consent over a number of minutes', Judge Neilson took the view that it fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness 'because there had been no ejaculation involved, so that the victim had not been exposed to the risk of pregnancy or having some sexually transmitted disease passed on to her'. In the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal in March 2013 justices Derek Price, Lucy McCallum and Monika Schmidt said the comment was 'entirely questionable'. Justice Blanch's Friday announcement comes after child abuse groups expressed disgust at Judge Neilson's comments. Bravehearts founder Hetty Johnston said she had sent a letter to the Attorney General and the Chief Justice of NSW calling for Judge Neilson's sacking. 'I also want them to revisit all the decisions he has made, in case they have created a precedent in sentencing which other judges have had to follow,' Ms Johnston told Daily Mail Australia on Friday. 'Clearly he's held these views for some time and it's gone unchecked. 'He’s been making all kinds of decisions for years, he's not a young man.' Adults Surviving Child Abuse president Dr Cathy Kezelman said Judge Neilson's comments were 'disgraceful'. 'The Attorney General needs to look at his appointment,' Dr Kezelman told Daily Mail Australia. 'This level of ignorance cannot be tolerated on our benches.' Dr Kezelman added that his 'misogynistic, paternalistic' views were damaging and said his conflation of incest with homosexuality was offensive. 'As a society we've come to understand homosexuality - that does not mean there's any parallel, not for a second, with child sex abuse and incest.'","NSW Judge Garry Neilson stood down while investigation is pending .

"By . Sarah Michael . Allergies can start to develop before babies are born and may be influenced by their mother's behaviour while she is pregnant, new research shows. For the first time ever the study by the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute in Melbourne showed key differences in the blood samples of babies who have food allergies and babies who don't, which could provide vital clues to identifying the cause of allergies. Report author Dr David Martino said when he compared the blood samples of 12-month-old babies he found the samples from infants with allergies had molecular pathways that operated differently. Allergies can start to develop in babies during pregnancy, new research shows . 'We actually looked at the molecular switches that control how genes are expressed and we found that there was an association with food allergy and disruption in some of these switches,' Dr Martino told Daily Mail Australia. The researchers then examined blood samples taken from the allergic children at birth, and found that the majority of the children showed these molecular differences were present when they were born. 'This means we think that some of the predisposition to developing food allergies may be already programmed into the developing child as early as pregnancy,' Dr Martino said. He added that this finding would help researchers investigate what mothers are exposed to during pregnancy, and how certain factors can modify the way their babies' genes behave. Blood samples from infants with allergies showed molecular pathways that operated differently to babies who are allergy free. Picture posed by model . Report co-author Katie Allen told The Today Show: 'We want to look to see whether there are some factors that occur in the baby in utero that we can modify simply before the baby is born. 'What we'll be looking at are things like diet and weight and smoking to see if we modify those whether that changes the control of the genes and therefore the risk of the baby developing food allergy.' Food allergies are on the rise globally and Australia has one of the highest rates in the world. The study looked at 24 children in total and will now be conducted on a wider scale with 5300 babies. Most of the allergic children studied were allergic to egg, and some were allergic to peanuts.

In the mid-2000s Ms Street was a senior associate at a top Sydney law firm specialising in private equity, working for clients such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. But her high-flying legal career is worlds away from her new occupation as a jazz and pop singer, which sees her playing regular live gigs in Sydney nightspots and singing 'flirty' songs on stage with her diamante-encrusted keytar. Scroll down for video . Sally Street left a high-flying career as a lawyer to pursue her dream of being a jazz musician . In the mid-2000s Ms Street was a senior associate at a top Sydney law firm specialising in private equity . Ms Street also used to be half of one of the Sydney law community's most high-profile couples, before her split from estranged husband Alexander 'Sandy' Street, SC, in September last year. Mr Street is the son of former NSW Chief Justice Sir Laurence Street, and his grandfather and great-grandfather were also NSW Chief Justices. Ms Street's mother and her estranged husband are in the middle of a legal battle over a disputed loan worth several hundred thousands of dollars. For years as a lawyer Ms Street would spend her weeks working – sometimes until 3am in the morning – and her weekends in the garage of jazz musician Freddie Wilson in Hunters Hill on Sydney's North Shore learning how to sing with a live band. 'I worked really hard… And I was totally at the top of my game doing that,' Ms Street told Daily Mail Australia from her home in Sydney's eastern suburbs. 'I used to think in the end there's got to be more to life than this. Ms Street's father was a jazz musician and ever since she can remember she has wanted to be a singer . Ms Street used to be half one of the Sydney law community's most high-profile couples, before her split from estranged husband Alexander 'Sandy' Street, SC, in September last year . 'But then when you have a passion that you just have to, at some point you have to just go if I don't do it now I'm never going to do it.' Ms Street's father was a jazz musician and ever since she can remember she has wanted to be a singer – but he persuaded her to pursue a career in law instead. 'He was never really home but when he was home there was always a house full of musicians jamming, that's all I remember from being a kid,' she said. 'He didn't even turn up to my birth or my wedding because he was at gigs. 'We lived in this really old rumble tumble shack down at Long Reef on the Northern Beaches and all I wanted to do was sing and then my dad said ""You can't do that, it's too hard, [the music industry] is not like it was, you just have to go and get yourself a real job"" so they made me go to uni.' Ms Street admits that before she left in 2007 parts of her law career at Mallesons Stephen Jaques (now King & Wood Mallesons) were exhilarating. In her shows and music videos Ms Street says she likes to incorporate sexiness 'kind of like Cameron Diaz, like girl next door sexy' 'Sometimes board meetings will start at midnight to get a deal over the line, and flying around to stay in swanky hotels and going out to awesome deal dinners,' she said. But Ms Street said if she had stayed on the law path full-time she believes something inside of her would have been 'empty and sad forever'. 'It's kind of cruel suppression passion. I don't think if you're passionate about something and you supress it you're ever truly happy,' she said. Ms Street's music career so far has seen her headline jazz festivals in Morocco and perform at the Venetian Casino in Macau, as well as win a handful of song-writing competitions. She has released independent albums including The Scorpion Maid, One Bite At The Cherry and Little Evil Me, but Ms Street is now looking get a break on commercial radio.

'Because I wasn't so worried about earning money, because I was married at the time to Sandy so he was like, you know, just do what you love so I kept writing,' she said. 'I was lucky I was able to be able to do what I wanted.' Following Mr and Ms Street's split last year, Ms Street's mother Helen Jenifer McDonald and her ex-husband have become embroiled in a legal battle over a disputed loan worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ms McDonald claims she lent the couple money when they were having problems making payments on the mortgage of their Vaucluse home, in Sydney's eastern suburbs, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Her divorce has seen her need to return to law to do some consulting work – but music is still her main focus. 'That's just for money, not because I want to do that at all, I don't, and I'd certainly never go back and do it full-time.' Ms Street said her music and lyrics have also changed since her divorce. 'It's been interesting being single,' she said. 'I haven't released them yet, [but] it's opening up new, love up-and-down kind of songs that I never used to write before.' Ms Street said if she had stayed on the law path full-time she believes something inside of her would have been 'empty and sad forever' 'Like high school romance, kitschy, hilarious… times I've had on Tinder,' she said. 'I'm not on Tinder anymore, that was fun though!' Ms Street also takes a lot of inspiration for songs from her friends. 'Most of the girls' nights out, meeting mad people and stories,' she said. In her shows and music videos Ms Street, who descirbes herself as a 'mischief maker' and a 'flirt' on her website says she likes to incorporate sexiness: 'kind of like Cameron Diaz, like girl next door sexy.'

"By . Sarah Michael . Lieutenant William Malcolm Chisholm just before sailing to France in August 1914 . The first Australian to die in World War I has been officially recognised by the Australian War Memorial almost 100 years after he died. Lieutenant William Malcolm Chisholm was 22 years old when he was wounded in the Battle of Le Cateau on 26 August 1914, just three days after arriving in France. He died the next day. Records previously showed Captain Brian Pockley and Able Seaman William Williams, both killed in September 1914, were the first Australians to have died in the Great War. Today the Australian War Memorial added Chisholm - who served in a British regiment - to its Commemorative Roll. But Chisholm's family say they have always known their relative died first, as have British and French historians and the authors of at least five books. Chisholm's great niece Airlie Moore said she had tried to inform the War Memorial about Chisholm in 2006. She added that she was contacted about adding Chisholm to the War Memorial's Commemorative Roll in April this year after an article about him appeared in a French newspaper. 'I said that I'd been to the War Memorial and I tried to talk to people and they weren't interested and they said it was because he was serving in a foreign regiment,' she said. 'I don't think we talk about a British regiment as a ""foreign regiment"" I think we talk about it as an ""ally"".' Lieutenant Malcolm Chisholm and the 1st Battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment . Chisholm was born in Sydney in 1892, the eldest son of an eminent surgeon. He grew up on Macquarie St in Sydney and attended Sydney Grammar School where he was a prefect. He was commissioned in the New South Wales Scottish Rifles before his family moved to England in 1910. Chisholm was accepted into the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1911. Two years later he was gazetted into the 1st Battalion, East Lancashire Regiment, and embarked for France in August 1914. 'He died in the Battle of Le Cateau which was part of the Battle of Mons which was the first major battle the British were involved with in France,' Mrs Moore told Daily Mail Australia. 'They were in retreat he was hit with shrapnel in the stomach.' Chisholm's grave in the French town of Ligny-en-Cambresis . Mrs Moore said his possessions were sent by the Red Cross back to her great grandparents. 'His sword was hanging on the wall of my father's office,' she said. 'We have his watch which was on him when he was killed.' Mrs Moore said she has known her relative was the first Australian to die in World War I since she was a child. 'We just knew. We didn't talk about it all the time, why would you, but we knew.' Mrs Moore said she believed the War Memorial was in a 'scramble' to recognise Chisholm before the memorial service to mark 100 years since his death. The service will be held on August 26th at St Stephen's Uniting Church on Macquarie St in Sydney – Chisholm's family church and the place where his original memorial service was held. British casualties at Le Cateau - part of the Battle of Mons which was the first major battle the British were involved with in France . 'It's a scramble because the French put an article in the paper,' she said. Mrs Moore said she is not angry it has taken almost a century for Chisholm to be added to the Commemorative Roll. 'I'm just slightly bemused,' she said. 'I think their credibility as a history source has suffered in my mind. 'I'll always look at their version of history and wonder how accurate it is, knowing they couldn't get this bit right.' A spokeswoman for the War Memorial said its Roll of Honour (the bronze panels in the cloisters of the Memorial's commemorative area) lists the names of 106,000 Australian servicemen and women who fought and died on active service as members of the Australian forces. The British Expeditionary Force lancers (Cavalry) charging German positions at Cateau. The Battle of Le Cateau was fought on 26 August 1914, after the British and French retreated from the Battle of Mons and had set up defensive positions in a fighting withdrawal against the German advance at Le Cateau-Cambrésis . 'Since Lieutenant Chisholm died while serving in a British regiment, he does not fit the criteria for the Roll of Honour,' she said. 'He does, however, meet the criteria for the Commemorative Roll, which honours Australians known to have fought and died in allied forces. 'Since we don't hold British service records here at the Memorial, we have to rely on the descendants of men like Lieut Chisholm to approach the Memorial with sufficient archival evidence and make an application for inclusion. 'The family of Malcolm Chisholm has never approached the Memorial with an application.' The spokeswoman added that a member of the public from Sydney started the ball rolling after a news report in March this year.","Lieutenant William Malcolm Chisholm was 22 years old when he was fatally wounded in the Battle of Le Cateau .
He died in August 1914, just three days after arriving in France .

"By . Candace Sutton . One hour after the early morning shooting up of a house in which a  man sleeping in the front bedroom was seriously wounded, a man returned to the house to do a re-enactment for his mate. Caught on CCTV footage, the man and his mate are seen to pull up in the driveway of the house on Cruickshank Street, Blakeview, in the far northern suburbs of  Adelaide. The driver of the dark blue VS Series 2 Holden Calais sedan leaps from the car and runs towards the dwelling. Clearly excited, the man, who is wearing a red t-shirt and shorts, fires with his finger at the house, aping the gun's recoil. His mate stands next to the car watching the enthusiastic recreation, which includes wild arm movements, staggering and the finger gun action. Scroll down for video . At 6.45am on February 26 this year, a 26-year-old man in the front bedroom of a house in Blakeview, in Adelaide's far northern suburbs, was shot three times in the back and suffered a collapsed lung. Detectives released CCTV of a man (circled in red) 'in an excited state' who appears to recreate the shooting with hand gestures, and who they believe is the shooter recreating the crime for a mate, and have asked the public to help identify him . It's 7.56am on Sunday, February 23 - barely an hour since a man inside the Adelaide house outside which the silver and white cars (pictured) are parked and the man in the red t-shirt has pulled up in the dark blue VS Series 2 Holden Calais sedan which he parks temporarily in the driveway as he heads onto the property . Second later, and from what appears to be a different camera angle, the man heads past a red car in the front yard of the house on Cruickshank Street, Blakeview in Adelaide's far northern suburbs where just an hour and a few minutes earlier a 23-year-old m,an has been shot three times in the back with a .22 calibre hand gun . The shaven headed man in the red t-shirt and shorts, who police say looked to be in an excited state, heads past the car. He is about to swap places with his mate and begin his recreation of the shooting . It is the morning of February 23 this year, and a 26-year-old has just been taken to hospital with a collapsed lung and three wounds in his upper back fired from a .22 calibre hand gun into his bedroom at around 6.45am. Still clearly excited about the incident, for which Adelaide detectives believe he is either the shooter or a witness, red t-shirt spends about a minute and a half showing off to his friend, before they get back in the car, reverse out and drive off. Police from the Crime Gangs Task Force released the CCTV footage on Wednesday to ask for help from the public in identifying the man, or anyone in connection with the shooting. Gotcha: South Australian detectives released CCTV footage today of a man apparently recreating a shooting an hour after it happened on a suburban street in the northern Adelaide suburb of Blakeview. They have appealed to the public to help identify the men in the security footage . The man in the red t-shirt gets ready to show his mate just what occurred an hour earlier at this address in Blakeview, in the far northern suburbs of Adelaide, when a 26-year-old was shot three times in the back and taken to hospital with a collapsed lung . A fraction of a second later and red t-shirt raises his arms, checks his mate is watching and and prepares to make a firing motion on the house . Total recoil: The suspect bends his body as if in recoil from firing the weapon, whih police have identified as a .22 calibre handgun which fired three rounds into the victim, who now faces continuing health problems following the collapse of one of his lungs . Task Force Detective Chief Inspector Kim Hand said a protracted investigation following the shooting had led to the seizure of the CCTV footage from an address in Elizabeth, in Adelaide's north about 6km from the site of the incident. 'We believe this shows a man who, in quite an excited state, is seen to re-enact what police believe occurred at the Blakeview property just an hour earlier,' Inspector Hand said. We know the man in this footage went to the address in a dark blue VS Series 2 Holden Calais sedan, which is now in the possession of police. More action: the man appears to flail around as if acting the possible response from the victim of the shooting . Bang bang: more gesticulations from the man to show what had occurred  at the suburban Adelaide house where just over an hour earlier a man sleeping in a front bedroom was shot in the back three times with a hand gun . And then I did this: the as yet unidentified man in the red shirt puts the finishing touches on his recreation for his mate of what had occurred earlier that morning in the shoot-up on a suburban Adelaide street . Show's over: Time to go as the man finishes his 80 second mime of the suburban house shooting for his mate and the pair climb back into the Holden Calais and take off. Police say soon after this a woman and a man were observed burning clothing on the side of the road just 6km south of this house in Blakeview, Adelaide . 'Police believe that while the incident was not random, the victim in this case was not the intended target of the shooting.'Investigators are also keen to identify the second man in the footage and believe he can help with the inquiry. The Task Force is also seeking the public's help to identify a man and a woman seen burning clothing on a road on the same morning at Kudla, just 6kms further north of the shooting site. The pair were spotted standing in front of a dark-coloured 4WD at around 8.30am, appearing to set fire to something on the left verge of Dalkeith road, near Coventry Road, Kudla. A small fire was located at teh side of the road, and burnt clothing was recovered which police believe may be related to the shooting. Police say the injured man may suffer long-term health consequences as a result of the wound which caused his lung to collapse. Anyone with information about either of these incidents, or who recognises the man in the CCTV footage, is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report online at https://sa.crimestoppers.com.au/ .","A man, 26, suffered three gunshot wounds when a house in northern Adelaide was shot up in February .

"By . Candace Sutton . It is a testament to the positive thinking of the Morcombe family who refused to be torn apart by the tragedy of 13-year-old Daniel Morcombe's abduction and murder on December 7, 2003. Next month, Daniel's twin, Bradley Morcombe, 24, will walk down the aisle with schoolgirl sweetheart Anna Martin in what will be a big family celebration. 'The wedding we hope will be a very positive and happy family event,' Bruce Morcombe told Daily Mail Australia on the same day he and wife, Denise, launched their book, 'Where is Daniel? The Family's story', published by Pan MacMillan. Scroll down for video . Next month, Daniel's twin, Bradley Morcombe, 24, and schoolgirl sweetheart Anna Martin (pictured) will walk down the aisle with in what will be a big family celebration.'The wedding we hope will be a very positive and happy family event,' Bruce Morcombe told Daily Mail Australia on the same day he and wife, Denise, launched their book, 'Where is Daniel - The Family's story', published by Pan MacMillan. He will be there forever: Bradley Morcombe (pictured, left, with his twin brother Daniel) has said that although Daniel is gone, he is with him and his famil every day. Daniel would have acted as Bradley's best man at next month's wedding to Anna Martin. Bradley's older brother Dean will be best man . Family first: Denise and Bruce Morcombe, who will celebrate their son Bradley's wedding next month, said as well as finding and bringing home their lost son, Bradley's twin Daniel Morcombe, they were determined not to let the tragedy tear the family apart. 'Where is Daniel - The Family's Story' they hope will help other families under stress of loss to remain a unit . The abduction of Daniel Morcombe (pictured, left) in December 2003 could have torn his family apart, but Bruce and Denise Morcombe were determined to keep their clan together, as they have detailed in their new book 'Where is Daniel? The Family's Story' (pictured, right, with a framed photo of Daniel). The family will now celebrate the wedding of Bradley Morcombe, Daniel's twin, next month on the Sunshine Coast . 'In the back of everyone's minds, there is where is Daniel, where is the twin? But it is Brad and Anna's day. 'There will be thoughts about Daniel. [You would have] expected him to be best man. 'But Dean [Bradley's older brother] will be the best man.' While Bruce Morcombe did not want to reveal the date of the happy event, which is expected to take place on the Sunshine Coast in September, he said the ceremony will reflect the wider' family' the Morcombes have acquired since Daniel went missing, through their long campaign to find him and the trial and conviction of murderer Brett Peter Cowan earlier this year. Family first: Bradley Morcombe, 24, (pictured, left) will marry his fiancee Anna Martin next month with his brother Dean (above, right) as best man in what parents Denise and Bruce hope will be a happy family ceremony. Bruce says he is proud of the achievements of his son Bradley, whose twin Daniel, was abducted and murdered on the Queensland Sunshine Coast in 2003, and of elder brother Dean . Twins: When Bradley Morcombe (left) gets married next month, his father Bruce Morcombe says it will be natural for some people to think 'where is Daniel (pictured, right), where is the twin' but that the days will belong to the couple Bradley and his bride, Anna Martin, and it will be a positive, happy family event . Bruce and Denise Morcombe's book 'Where is Daniel? The Family's Story' is intended to help other families under stress or who have lost loved ones to hold together and not crumble in the face of adversity . Julie Elliott, a former police senior sergeant stationed at Caboolture, 40km north of Brisbane, was appointed as a special police media liaison officer exclusively to the Morcombe case; she retired from the police force to become a civil celebrant and will marry Bradley Morcombe and Ms Martin. Kay McGrath, a Channel 7 Queensland journalist and presenter who covered the Daniel Morcombe case, will act as the wedding's MC. Bradley Morcombe, who works as a fencing contractor, has previously told Australian Women's Weekly how he might have accompanied his twin brother on the Christmas shopping expedition that ended in Daniel's disappearance and murder by Cowan, which left the family in limbo as Denise and Bruce pursued answers as to what had happened to their son. Priorities: Bruce and Denise Morcombe said finding their son Daniel, who was abducted and murdered by Brett Peter Cowan (pictured) in December 2003 was of huge importance - but so was keeping their family together, which they write about in their new book . Bradley told the Weekly there had not been a day since that he hadn't thought of his brother. 'He is with us all the time, every single day,' Bradley said. 'He's still part of the family. He'll always be my brother and I'll always miss him, no matter what happens in the future.' Bruce Morcombe told Daily Mail Australia keeping their family together under such strains and pressures was one of his and Denise's great achievements, which he hoped to impart to other families suffering tragedy and loss. 'If the Morcombes can stay together, well so can others,' he said. 'The book ... is very much a survival of the Morcombe family, so that out experience will benefit other families. 'It was very much a concerted decision {for us] to be strong. You are very much aware through media reports how a significant life event almost always results in the family exploding. 'Because of crises [families] have disintegrated. People become depressed and some don't manage all that well.' Mr Morcombe as much as he and Denise had been determined to find their son, in the early stages hoping to find him safe, and then to bring home his remains and the killer Cowan to justice, 'Where is Daniel - The Family's story' was about their other driving force. 'We made that very much known within the inner family ... that this will not tear us apart,' he said. Mr Morcombe said he has watched on proudly as older son Dean and Daniel's twin, Bradley, have pass their life miletsones. 'They both have good jobs, a steady girlfriend and they've purchased houses. 'I think holding the family together has been one of the highest priorities and of course finding Daniel. 'It wasn't easy. How do you put ona 21st party for Bradley and everyone thinks we should have two cakes, but you have to be realistic and celebrate the positive aspect. 'And we have all stuck together.' Bradley Morcombe and Anna Martin both attended Siena Catholic College at Sippy Downs on Queensland's Sunshine Coast and live locally at Buderim. 'Where is Daniel? The Family's Story' written with Lindsay Simpson, published by Pan MacMillan, is available from bookshops for $32.99 from Tuesday.","Daniel Morcombe's parents launched their book 'Where is Daniel?

"By . Candace Sutton . They are members of the nation's squattocracy from Australia's richest agricultural shire where the families of the landed gentry enjoy a life of picnic race meetings and the town and country club. The Turnbulls - whose patriarch Ian Robert Turnbull stands accused of murdering government officer and father of two, Glen Turner, by shooting him in the back - are among the lucky families who live in Australia's 'Golden Triangle' around Moree in NSW's northwest. The area earned the name because it is blessed by a temperate climate and abundant water supply both from inland rivers and the Great Artesian Basin, the rich black soil plains of Moree, Tamworth and Gunnedah in northern NSW stretching up to the Queensland border are so fertile, the locals say, 'they could grow babies'. Balck gold: the black soil palins of Moree and teh area in northern NSW which borders Queensland known as the golden triangle attracts the country's highest wheat yield and is valued at more than $4000 per hectare. Grazier families going back generations in this region are regarded as Australia's rural aristocracy, of which accused murderer Ian Robert Turnbull is one . Wrong place: Environment and Heritage compliance officer Glen Turner, 51, (pictured) was allegedly shot in the back by wealthy farmer Ian Turnbull after the father-of-two served an illegal land clearing notice. The accused's family has lived in Australia's rich 'golden triangle' agricultural region since the 1880s among other families known as the nation's 'squattocracy' Farmer Ian Turnbull (pictured, left) is accused of murdering environmental officer Glen Turner on Tuesday after the 79-year-old grazier whose family has been in the Moree area for more than a century allegedly shot Mr Turner in the back on a property at Croppa Creek, 60km north east of Moree. In a long running land dispute which began in 2011, Turnbull had pleaded guilty in the Land and Environment Court to illegally clearing native vegetation on land which was then ploughed, and sowed with crops which were harvested in late 2012 . But this way of life for the privileged families who have occupied homesteads on cattle and crop stations for generations is under threat of disappearing. And the allegations of murder against a prominent member of one of these families has blown a cover off the charmed lives enjoyed by those who own thousands of hectares worth millions of dollars. Police allege Turnbull, a 79-year-old farmer whose family owns large tracts of land on the Moree Plains, shot Mr Turner, 51, an Environment and Heritage compliance officer at around 5.40pm on Tuesday on a property at Croppa Creek, 60km north-west of Moree. The Turnbulls are said to have been in the area since the 1880s, own at least four homesteads and  and properties totalling thousands of hectares in a region where prime cropping land can reach up to $4300 a hectare. On the way out: Allegations of murder against Ian Turnbull, a prominent member of one of the families who farm Australia's most lucrative wheat growing belt (pictured), around Moree in northern NSW, has blown the cover off the charmed lives enjoyed by those who own thousands of hectares worth millions. This way of life for the privileged families who have occupied homesteads on cattle and crop stations for generations is under threat of disappearing . Police allege Turnbull, a 79-year-old farmer whose family owns large tracts of land and homsteads on the Moree Plains, shot Mr Turner, 51, an Environment and Heritage compliance officer at around 5.40pm on Tuesday on a property near Croppa Creek, a town whose iconic grain silos, pictured, dominate the skyline) 60km north-west of Moree . Mr Turner had arrived at the property to serve a notice for illegally clearing vegetation off his land. 'If you look at this family inside the tragedy they are typical of squattocracy who have owned a lot of properties for generations,' country real estate agent and deputy president of the Real Estate institute of NSW, Malcolm Gunning told Daily Mail Australia. 'These are families who  used to own the flat in [exclusive Sydney suburb] Darling Point and show their cattle at the Royal Easter Show. 'For some that sort of life is coming to an end, but the local economies in these places are doing well. 'Their land is thousands for each hectare and this is where we are seeing a lot of interest from foreign investors.' It could grow babies: So rich are the black soil plains in the 'golden triangle' region of northern NSW which stretches to the Queensland border that hectares of prime wheat cropping properties go for up to $4300 and the rich farming families that have been there for generations are regarded as Australia's rural landed gentry . The families who farm the black soil plains around Moree (pictured)  are the landed gentry who 'used to own the flat in [exclusive Sydney suburb] Darling Point and show their cattle at the Royal Easter Show ... their land is thousands for each hectare and this is where we are seeing a lot of interest from foreign investors.' Daily Mail Australia spoke with a former Tamworth resident who did not want to be identified, but who said the wealth on the Moree Plains and the environmental laws were in a head on clash. 'There's massive wealth in Moree and it's led to some huge land disputes which never happened before land clearing was made illegal. 'The families who own this land think it's their right to do with it what they want and get in a fleet of 14 bulldozers and root rape it up and plant wheat. 'They are the local aristocracy and they've been there for more than a century. 'It's black volcanic soil and basalt and if you can clear the bush of lignum and brigalow to make way for crops you can make squillions. 'But you're dealing with an environment department which says some plants farmers would regard as weeds are native and can't be removed.' The Turnbulls are well-respected among Australia's largest grain producers and family concerns who grow wheat, cotton, oil seeds like canola, olives and pecans in the Moree Plains Shire, which has a population of around 13.500 living on 18,000km of land. Ian Turnbull and members of his family have been in disputes over land clearing with the Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) since 2011. Turnbull pleaded guilty to illegally clearing native vegetation between November 2011 and January 2012 after he bulldozed 421ha on Colorado (pictured, in an OEH submission document), owned by his son Grant, and 73ha on Strathdoon, owned by his grandson, Cory . Ian and Robeena Turnbull, their sons Grant and Roger and their grandchildren and the family companies own properties including  Colorado and Strathdoon which totalled 2500ha, as well as Wallam and Buckie Station, and numerous parcels of land making up thousands of hectares in and around the Moree Plains. In April this year, RP Data showed recent grain property sales in the Moree area reached $4000 a hectare and some better know properties were going for up to $4300/ha. 'There are families who been there since the 1800s and they have substantial holdings, although 100,000 acres will do in this region because the soil is so good,' Mr Gunning said. $4300 a hectare: The land where Ian Turnbull and his family own thousands of hectares in the Moree region (pictured) in northern NSW has a temperate climate, rich volcanic soil and plenty of irrigation from surface water or the Great Artesian Basin beneath it, making the Turnbulls and other families who go back generations among the nation's wealthiest graziers . 'That's a very good income. Moree, Tamworth, Gunnedah and Dubbo are the booming cities of NSW. 'The crop prices are OK, there's been reasonable rain and if you look at the undulating land around Gunnedah with such good soil, you undersow the crop with clover so you can graze and what they do is rotate the livestock and the grain and they do it very very successfully.' Ian Turnbull and members of his family have been in disputes over land clearing with the Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) since 2011. Turnbull pleaded guilty in the Land and Environment Court to illegally clearing native vegetation between November 2011 and January 2012 after, the OEH said, he bulldozed 421ha on Colorado, owned by his son Grant, and 73ha on Strathdoon, owned by his grandson, Cory. Documents filed by the department show that an environmental assessment of an application to clear grazing land on Colorado for cropping found there was a koala colony on the land. A survey lists brigalow as a threatened native plant. Two properties of 999ha and 74ha were bought by Ian and Grant Turnbull in 2011 for $4m each. The Land and Environment Court heard, after contracts were exchanged but before the sales settled, Mr Turnbull and another unnamed man felled 2708 trees on Colorado and 694 trees on Strathdoon, Fairfax Media reported . The felled timbers was burnt, the land was then ploughed, sprayed with herbicide and sowed with wheat and barley which was subsequently harvested in late 2012. 'He didn't lodge a DA to get rid of the trees and did it because he probably had done it before and he was pressed,' Mr Gunning said, 'it's a tragedy. 'The family would be devastated.' A Croppa Creek farmer who knows Turnbull told Daily Mail Australia through an intermediary that 'land clearing is hard' on farmers. A tearful Ian Robert Turnbull appeared distraught as he was led into the dock of Moree Local Court on Wednesday, where he was refused bail and remanded in custody.

"By . Freya Noble . and Candace Sutton . The five members of the Van Den Hende family who tragically lost their lives in the fatal MH17 flight will be laid to rest in Australia. Hans, 48, his wife Shaliza Dewa, 45, and their children Piers, 15, Marnix, 12 and Margaux, 8, lived in Australia for just five years and were on their way home from a holiday in Europe when the plane went down. There was uncertainty surrounding where the final resting place of the family would be, as Hans' was from the Netherlands, Shaliza was Malaysian but they had put down roots in Australia. They had been based in the Victorian town of Eynesbury for the past three years, and had formed close-knit bonds in the community where their children attended school and played in local sports teams. Mum Shaliza, daughter Margaux, Dad Hans, elder son Piers, and younger son Marnix will be buried all together in Australia once their bodies are recovered from the MH17 crash site . Hans' sister told News Corp Australia the family would be buried in the country that they had made their home and were so happy in. 'We have agreed that they will be buried all together in Australia', Franka Van Den Hende said. She also revealed she had been contacted directly by the Prime Minister and Governor-General and greatly appreciated their support. The family had been on a trip to Europe where they had 'just had a wonderful holiday going back to where they had met in the UK during their PhD studies, to my brother's home country the Netherlands and their family, and a week with my sister and their family in Denmark', Ms Van Den Hende said. Shaliza, pictured with daughter Margaux, was born in Malaysia and it was uncertain where the family would be laid to rest . Tributes poured in for the much-loved family during a memorial held in the community last week, which more than 500 people attended. Many of the children's friends took the microphone to express their shock and dismay at the tragedy. Close friend of the family Tanya Wilmott organised the ceremony, and told Daily Mail Australia the loss of the family was 'a difficult thing to comprehend'. Ms Willmott said she got to know Shaliza because their children were around the same age and all went to the same school, ICA Melton College in nearby Caroline Springs. When the school closed suddenly, the two families transferred their kids to Bacchus Marsh College. Tributes for the family poured in at a memorial service held in their hometown of Eynesbury in Victoria last week . She also revealed last week she did not think Australia would be the family's final resting place, as they had family on Hans' side in the Netherlands and on Shaliza's side in Malaysia. 'She was just a beautiful person, so down to earth you would almost call her Australian,' Ms Willmott said. 'Shaliza really took to the Australian lifestyle. It sounds like a cliché but it was a positive experience meeting this family. They touched people and you didn't forget them.' Their neat weatherboard home 50 kilometres west of Melbourne is still full of their belongings, and members of the community have been at a loss on how to grieve for the family as the house lies empty and their bodies are yet to be returned.

School mate Erin Louise, 12 (pictured) gives a tearful but touching account of what she remembered of her classmate Marnix Van Den Hende, who she said had an imaginative personality and was good at art . Hans Van Den Hende, 48, his wife Shaliza Dewa, 45, and their children Piers, 15, Marnix, 12 and Margaux, 8, lived in Australia for just five years and at their house in Eynesbury for just under three years. But they forged deep bonds in the community in that short time, especially as the Van Den Hende children forged those friendship bonds with others they played soccer and swam with or spent their time socialising with. To have this entire family ripped from such a small, tight knit community has left the town with a profound sense of loss, which the empty house and the lack of a final resting place only amplifies. At the memorial Ms Wilmott organised last Sunday at Eynesbury Homestead, which drew 500 people from all the walks of the Van Den Hende family's life, child after child took the microphone to express their shock and dismay at the tragedy. Team mates of Piers Van Den Hende from the Melton Phoenix under 15s Football Club laid tributes at last Sunday's memorial at Eynesbury Homestead west of Melbourne. Piers was a 'courageous' goal keeper and team mate Lucas said of his death, 'we don't know what to do. We are all heartbroken . 'He was just the nicest kid': Piers Van Den Hende, 15, (left) the eldest of the children was remembered by his football and class mates as 'one of the nicest kids you ever met' and 'always such a positive person'. Margaux Van Den Hende, 8, (right) was 'a beautiful little girl' who had 'lots of friends'. The three Van Den Hende children were popular, loved living in Australia and in the western Melbourne town of Eynesbury where they loved the bush and the freedom of riding their bikes . Family friend Tanya Willmott (pictured, centre, in knitted brown top) and her children knew the Van Den Hende family and well and said of their sudden loss, 'it's a difficult thing to comprehend. The house where they were living is there with their belongings, but they have just disappeared. We just hope that with what's going on over there [in Ukraine] that all five members of the family are able to be found and returned' A crowd of fine hundred friends from all the walks of the Van Den Hende family's lives - football, swimming, school, work - gathered at the Eynesbury Homestead on Sunday to remember them. Child after child got up and wept at the loss of their cherished mates . The five Van Den Hendes had been on a family holiday to Europe where, according to Hans' sister, Franka, they had 'just had a wonderful holiday going back to where they had met in the UK during their PhD studies, to my brother's home country the Netherlands and their family, and a week with my sister and their family in Denmark'. That they didn't return, one friend who had played golf with Piers responded: 'I can’t understand they are gone. It’s such a disaster. I hope they are somewhere better now'. Piers' team mate, Lucas, from the Melton Phoenix under 15s Football Club, put it this way: 'We don’t know what to do. We are all heartbroken'. Counselling: fellow students of Bacchus Marsh College have received counselling following the death of the Van Den Hende family in MH17, and school principal Andrew Neal said a special place at the school allowed grieving students to lay flowers, cards and teddy bears in their memory . Forever missed: Although the three Van Den Hende children travelled on Netherlands passports and had only lived in Australia since 2009, they were both loved by their Australian friends and they loved 'the Aussie lifestyle' of the town of Eyenesbury 40km west of Melbourne's CBD . Unimaginable loss: the Eynesbury community including students from Bacchus Marsh Grammar (pictured) wore their school uniforms to honour the memory of the Van Den Hende family whose deaths in the MH17 disaster have left a hole in local people's lives . A friend of Marnix said: 'His Mum was one of the nicest mums. His father was very good. [Marnix] was very positive and nice. It is heartbreaking and shocking what happened.' Members of the Melton Swimming Club, of which Marnix was a member and talented butterflyer, spoke about the occasion he first made the Victorian state team. 'His Mum was so bright. I made my first state with Marnix and his Mum was up there jumping in the grandstand.' A friend of Piers remebered him as 'nice to everyone and one of the best kids I ever met in my life'. Ms Willmott said she got to know Shaliza because their children were around the same age and all went to the same school, ICA Melton College in nearby Caroline Springs. When the school closed suddenly, the two families transferred their kids to Bacchus Marsh College. Beautiful family: although the Australian friends of the Van Den Hende family (pictured) know that their final resting place will likely be in father Hans' homeland of the Netherlands or mother Shaliza's homeland of Malaysia, they are praying for the return of all five family members' remains from the difficult process of recovery and identification that is proceeding in the Ukraine and Holland . A schoolgirl from Bacchus Marsh Grammar in far western Melbourne studies photographs of Piers, Marnix and Margaux Van Den Hende which were on display at the memorial held last Sunday for grieving friends at Eynesbury Homestead . 'She was just a beautiful person, so down to earth you would almost call her Australian,' she said. 'She was always happy and so fit. She looked after her mind and body. 'She loved the outdoors and the natural setting out here where you get kangaroos on the golf course,' Ms Willmott told Daily Mail Australia. 'Shaliza really took to the Australian lifestyle. It sounds like a cliché but it was a positive experience meeting this family. They touched people and you didn't forget them. Coming to terms: the suddenness of loss following the MH17 tragedy is being felt keenly in the tight knit community of Eyenesbury in western Melbourne which lost the five member Van Den Hende family . 'That's why it's so difficult. There are families on two continents and we don't know yet where their final resting place will be. 'I'm not expecting it to be in Australia, but with all these horrendous details, whether all five are there [among the bodies waiting to be identified] or not that also very much on your mind. 'Their house? I would assume there would be family coming out and we are getting together, different groups, to talk about some permanent memorial, something at Eynesbury, at the school and in the sporting groups. 'But we are making sure the house is secure in the meantime.' Bacchus Marsh College principal Andrew Neal told Daily Mail Australia the school had offered counselling to its pupils and had a special place at the school where children had been leaving flowers, notes and teddy bears at a statue of a mother and child which had been crafted by a former student. He praised the 'resilience' of the Van Den Hende's class mates and said a permanent plaque would be placed on a tree in the school grounds. Of the grisly news about the gathering of the victims' remains, he said he had counselled parents to monitor the school childrens' intake of news. He said of what had taken place at the crime scene in Ukraine: 'It's reminiscent of some 19th century picking over of the battlefield, something you would have thought would have died out 150 years ago.'","In the wake of MH17 the Victorian town of Eynesbury is mourning the Van Den Hende family .

"By . Candace Sutton . It's the house where Gerard Baden-Clay murdered his wife and dragged her body through autumn leaves to the carport. Then he drove Allison Baden-Clay away from her family home and her sleeping daughters for the last time. It is a house which has become eerily familiar to millions of Australians, who followed weeks of evidence in the Baden-Clay murder trial, the site from which screams and thuds were heard on the night Allison Baden-Clay disappeared. Scroll down for video . Scene of the crime: Is this the spot where Gerard Baden-Clay murdered wife Allison? The outdoor patio of 593 Brookfield Road, Brookfield (photographed four months after the murder) has been suggested as the actual murder scene, after evidence was given the couple's three sleeping daughters inside the house heard no noises, neighbours did hear screams, thuds and an argument, and Allison's body was found with six plant specimens common to the back yard of the home . Spooked: Harcourts real estate agency in the western Brisbane suburb of Kenmore advertised the Baden-Clay residence as a 'must inspect' property in the months after the murder took place, but prospective residents were either unimpressed by the home's dejected air, or spooked by the fact a woman had been murdered by her husband inside it . The house where Allison Baden-Clay was killed had four bedrooms and two bathrooms, but failed to rent when this picture was advertised in 2012 a few months after it was vacated when Gerard Baden-Clay was jailed to await trial. The property's owners installed a caretaker and now plan to build another dwelling on the one hectare site to extend their adjacent child care business . It's the place where Ms Baden-Clay inflicted the telltale scratches on her husband as he probably smothered her, with the back yard where leaves unique to the property became entangled in her hair and clothing. It was as if the house itself was giving evidence during the five week murder trial, with its plant specimens, its neatness after the murderer tidied up, the position of parked family cars and the placement of the killer's mobile phone charger all telling points in the prosecution case. But 593 Brookfield Road, Brookfield in Brisbane's west is also the house where no-one wants to live, barring a caretaker and administration staff for the child care centre which occupies the same address. Owners Mosman Services Pty Ltd first put the house back on the market in August 2012, four months after Allison had disappeared and 10 weeks after Gerard Baden-Clay was charged with her murder. The four-bedroom, two bathroom home with its dated pink and peach decor was available for a weekly rent of $460. But as photographs of the house show, its bare, stained rooms either failed to excite or its bloody past spooked potential renters. Grisly history: It was the home where the marriage of Allison and Gerard Baden-Clay (pictured, left, on their wedding day in 1997) finally unravelled in a bloody struggle which resulted in her death, but not before she had clawed his face (right) as she fought him to her death. Now the home has failed to attract renters and is occupied by the caretaker of an adjacent child care centre . If the walls could speak: As if the house itself was giving testimony during the Baden-Clay murder trial, certain aspects spoke volumes to investigating detectives who fund the kitchen (pictured) had been wiped clean and the bathroom had no trace of the killer's purported shaving accident. Growing in the backyard were plant specimens a botanist would link to leaf litter found on Allison Baden-Clay's body . Screams, plants and blood: evidence given during the Baden-Clay trial which compelled the jury into convicting Gerard of the murder of his wife Allison were that screams came from the house (pictured), leaf specimens came from the back yard and Allison's blood was found in her Holden Captiva which was parked in the car port . Scuffle on the patio: Recreated by Channel Nine's 60 Minutes programme, the scuffle which ended Allison's life was depicted as happening in the back yard of the Baden-Clay home, after which she was taken to a creek bed 14km away. the house has failed to rent since . After the house failed to rent, owners of the large one hectare block, on which there is the Brookfield Early Childhood Centre, made a development application (DA) to extend the childcare facilities. The DA approved by Brisbane City Council notes the house where Allison was murdered as merely 'existing caretaker's dwelling'. The car port where police photographs showed Allison's Holden Captiva - the vehicle Gerard Baden-Clay used to transport his wife's body to Kholo Creek - is slated as 'proposed car parks'. When Daily Mail Australia visited the site, the car par was full of cars and desks with computers were set up inside the former Baden-Clay family home with administration staff for the child care centre busy and working. The approved DA shows plans for a new building to boost the capacity of the facility from 75 to 123 children. In 2012, four months after Allison's murder, the Kenmore branch of Harcourts real estate had listed the home as a 'must inspect' property, with open-plan living and an entertainment patio. It was across the home's back patio that viewers of Nine Network's 60 Minutes programme on Sunday about the Baden-Clay case watched the recreation by the of Gerard Baden-Clay dragging his wife's body. Photographs of the house taken just months after the murder show leaves scattered on the pavers. Compelling testimony during trial which gripped the public and helped convince a Brisbane Supreme Court jury of the accused's guilt involved six botanic specimens. Real estate ethics expert Neil Jenman says the Baden-Clay house (pictured, in property photos fur months after the murder) may have failed to rent because nobody knows in what room the murder actually took place . It's not the faded 1980s pink and peach decor of the Baden-Clay home (pictured) which put people off, but what went on there. Not only did Gerard Baden-Clay kill his wife while his children were sleeping in the house, he subjected her to years of emotional abuse within its walls . A police photograph taken just four days after Allison Baden-Clay's murder shows the same house with the family's belongings strewn about. Four months on, with the house emptied of all trace of the tragic family, real estate agency Harcourts could attract no renters and now tow years later, the property owners are extending a child care centre on the site . Cat's claw, eucalyptus, crepe myrtle, chinese elm, lilli pilli and fishbone fern were found both on Allison's body and growing in the back yard of 593 Brookfield Road, Brookfield. Samples of the specimens (pictured) were used as compelling evidence to convict Gerard Baden-Clay . Cat's claw, eucalyptus, crepe myrtle, chinese elm, lilli pilli and fishbone fern were found both on Allison's body and growing in the back yard. Another factor in the trial was lack of blood in the bathroom to support Gerard Baden-Clay's claims he had cut himself shaving, and an overly tidy house - police suspected he had cleaned up. Evidence included the fact police could detect Baden-Clay had plugged his mobile phone into its charger at 1.38am, when he claimed to be in a heavy sleep. The placement of the power point on his side of the bed, when he claimed he had relinquished his phone to Allison, as well as the layout of the house were factors in the trial. The Sydney houses where Sef Gonzales murdered his parents and sister in 2001 and where five members of the Lin family were slain in 2009 have both sold, albeit at reduced prices, but the Baden-Clay 'murder house' (pictured) has failed to attract anyone interested in renting despite it being advertised two years ago for $460 a week. Haunted house: the property 593 Brookfield Road, Brookfield is in a prestige area of western Brisbane but when it was offered for rental, no family was interested. It is now being developed and a caretake lives in the house . 'Murder houses"" or homes where significant crimes have taken place are required to be advertised with full disclosure of the grisly event, which brings the price down but does not preclude a sale. The Sydney house in which Sef Gonzales murdered his parents and sister in 2001, sold in 2005 for $720,000 after the owners tried to offload it for $800,000 without disclosing its past . The house in the north-western Sydney suburb of North Epping, in which five members of the Lin family were slain in 2009, was sold after remaining empty for three years following the murders. Real estate ethics expert, Neil Jenman, was the property agent who blew the whistle on the attempted sale without disclosure of the Gonzales family house. Mr Jenman said the Baden-Clay family house may not have rented because an agent could not specifically point out the room where the crime took place. Mr Jenman told Daily Mail Australia families seeking to rent the Baden-Clay house would be 'spooked' by not knowing exactly what went on in the house. 'Only Gerard Baden-Clay knows what he did in that house,' Mr Jenman said. 'Anyone going into the house would have to think ""where did he do it?"". 'It is such a creepy thing. 'A lot of people are quite religious or superstitious and one of the things they do when they buy a house is get a priest in to bless it. 'Generally speaking if a gruesome murder has gone on it takes about ten per cent off the price. 'But if there's a bit of a mystery,  well it spooks people.' Mr Jenman said after his intervention in the Sef Gonzales house sale, potential buyers knew all the gory details about where Gonzales had committed his murders in the house, and that the family home had sold.","Property agents failed to rent out the Baden-Clay murder house .

"By . Candace Sutton . and Australian Associated Press . Fingerprints, DNA evidence and CCTV footage are still being compiled in the murder case against former NSW detectives Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara, a court has heard. Rogerson and McNamara have been charged with the shooting murder of 20-year-old student Jamie Gao in a rented storage shed in May. His body was found wrapped in a tarpaulin floating in the sea off a beach in Cronulla, southern Sydney, on May 26. They have also been accused of commercial drug supply.

"By . Candace Sutton . Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the relationship between Ukraine and Russia has been a complicated one. Divided by political and civil unrest, Ukraine has become a pawn in a power game played by Russian president Vladimir Putin. Its citizens comprise those loyal to Russia and those who want Ukraine to remain an independent country to Russian rule. Scroll down for video . Revolution: internal strife in Ukraine led to an uprising in February (pictured) when the Ukrainian Parliament deposed President Viktor Yanukovych and installed a pro-Western interim leader in what Russian president Vladimir Putin has criticised as a coup d'etat . Fled: Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych (above, left) fled the Ukrainian capital Kiev in February following an uprising by the people. Yanukovich was targeted by protestors who objected to his imprisoning of local political hero, Yulia Tymoshenko (above, right) Mired in unrest: Ukraine lies between Europe and Russia and despite its being the world's third largest grain producer the country has been debt-ridden and suffered a series of political uprisings and unrest in a power game between Russia and the west . Ukraine lies in a strategic position between Russia and Europe and has vital ports on the Black Sea in its troubled autonomous region, the Crimean Peninsula . Mired by years of corruption, mismanagement and a lack of economic growth, businesswoman and local political hero Yulia Tymoshenko, led a protest movement throughout the 2000s. In November 2013, in an attempt to appease the population's rising impatience with a poor standard of living and inadequate health care system, president Victor Yanukovych faced two options - sign off on a deal with the EU which would see Tymoshenko released from prison, or take a $15 billion loan from Russia. Yanukovych chose to sign the treaty with Russia, enraging sections of the population. An anti-government protester stands on a barricade in Kiev, on February 15, 2014. Protesters occupied Kiev city hall as anti-government unrest rocking the country ahead of the president being deposed and fleeing Kiev for Russia after which a pro-western interim leadre was installed, denounced by Vladimir Putin as a puppet . Pro-Russian Crimean self-defence forces guarded Lenin Square, in the Crimean city of Simferopot on March 2, 2014, as the standoff between the Russian military and Ukrainian forces continues in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula . Violent clashes between protestors and riot police ensued in Kiev, which escalated into a revolution as hundreds of protestors marched on the city centre demanding the deposing of President Yanukovych by the Ukrainian parliament, and on February 21, Yanuokovych fled Kiev for Russia. The new government of Oleksandr Turchynov was recognised by the United States and European Union, but condemned by Russia as illegitimate. Russia then accused the United States and the EU of funding and directing the Ukrainian revolution. Fresh elections for Ukraine were due in May 25, but Russia called for them to be postponed. Meanwhile, an international crisis involving Russia and Ukraine broke out over the control of the Crimean Peninsula, a province of Ukraine which lies on the Black Sea with strategic ports. On February 26, local self-defence forces began to take control of the Crimean peninsula. Sources reported that military personnel in Russian-made uniform without insignia, and former members of the Ukraine military were involved. Most of Crimea’s two million inhabitants speak Russian and describe themselves as Russian, and even though they hold Ukrainian passports they live in an autonomous region with its own constitution and parliament. However, there is also a percentage of revolutionary dissidents who hate Russia, called the Crimean Tartars, who feared Russian president Vladimir Putin would encourage the Ukrainian separatist movement for his own political benefit and intervene militarily in Crimea. Russian arms and munitions have allegedly been sent in support to separatists in Donetsk, Ukraine, where pro-Russia rebels have now claimed responsibility for having shot down a military transport plane on July 17. The so-called Donetsk People's Republic is a self-proclaimed, unrecognized state in eastern Ukraine which shares a border with Russia. The Ukrainian administration has described it as a terrorist organisation. Reports say Russian-backed Donetsk separatist leader Igor Girkin, who also goes by the name of Strelkov, has claimed responsibility for ordering the missile attack on Malaysian flight MH17, perhaps thinking it was a Ukrainian military aircraft.","Ukraine and Russia have always shared a complex relationship .

"Fourteen years before he appeared as Gerard Baden-Clay's defence witness, Australian toxicologist Michael Robertson was involved in a case which gripped the U.S. - the 'American Beauty' murder. Dr Robertson appeared at the Brisbane Supreme Court this month as one of the final witnesses in Gerard Baden-Clay's trial for the murder of his wife Allison. He gave evidence in Baden-Clay's defence as to the levels of sertraline - the chemical in the antidepressant Zoloft - present in Allison Baden-Clay's body, and whether they indicated suicide by overdose. Dr Robertson presented his credentials of more than two decades working as a respected forensic toxicologist to the court. Scroll down for video . Michael Robertson (pictured, leaving the Brisbane Supreme Court on July 2) was the boss and lover of fellow toxicologist Kristin Rossum who murdered husband Greg De Villers in 2000 and covered his body in rose petals. Rossum, who was sentenced to life for first degree murder,  claimed her husband suicided by overdosing with the drug fentanyl. Dr Robertson gave evidence that Gerard Baden-Clay's wife Allison could have overdosed on the drug Zoloft . Fall from grace: Despite a privileged background and good education, Kristin Rossum (pictured in handcuffs arriving at court) developed a methamphetamine habit in her teens. After marrying Greg De Villers, she started an affair at the San Diego Medical Examiners office with her boss, Australian Dr Michael Robertson. When her husband threatened to expose her drug habit and affair, she killed him . Doomed: When Kristin Rossum met Greg De Villers in 1995 she had a speed habit, but he helped her get over it by the time they married (pictured) in June, 1999. A year later she had embarked on an affair with the man she worked for in the county toxicology laboratory in San Diego. On November 2, paramedics were called to the couple's apartment where they found De Villers comatose on the bed and covered in rose petal . American beauty murder: In the 1999 film, American Beauty, the character played by Kevin Spacey fantasises about the character Angela in a bath of rose petals. When the following year toxicologist Kristin Rossum poisoned her husband and sprinkled him with rose petals to suggest suicide, the case became known as the American Beauty murder . Under cross-examination by Crown Prosecutor Todd Fuller, QC, Dr Robertson agreed that the levels could have been as a result of decomposition and she might not have taken any of the drug before her death. Unbeknown to the jury or most people in the court, in November 2002, Dr Robertson had a close connection with a different murder trial. In 2000, he had become romantically involved with a woman who was charged with first degree murder in what was dubbed the 'American Beauty' case for its similarities to the 1999 Kevin Spacey film of the same name. Dr Robertson was the lover of Kristin Margarethe Rossum, who worked for him at the San Diego County Office of the Medical Examiner, where he was chief toxicologist. Short-lived: Kristin Rossum and Greg De Villers were married for a year but the relationship soured when she began having an affair with Australian toxicologist Michael Robertson and resumed her drug habit. She told her murder trial De Villers overdosed because he was unhappy in their marriage. Robertson, who has always denied any involvement in the case, gave expert testimony for Gerard Baden-Clay this month, saying levels of the drug Zoloft in Allison Baden-Clays body could suggest an overdose's . Pretty and promising: In 2000, accomplished Californian chemistry graduate and pretty blonde from a privileged background, Kristin Rossum, had a glittering future. But when she embarked on an affair with an Australian toxicologist, resumed her drug habit and then murdered her husband. She claimed her husband had committed suicide but a jury didn't believe her . No parole: Promising young science graduate turned convicted husband murderer Kristin Rossum is currently incarcerated in the Central California Women's Prison (pictured) where she is serving  a life sentence for the poisoning death of her husband, Greg De Villers, in what became known as the American Beauty murder . When Greg De Villers threatened his wife Kristin Rossum with exposure of her affair with the boss, Australian toxicologist Michael Robertson, and her resumption of her methamphetamine habit, the honours chemistry graduate drugged him with a lethal dose of the powerful pain killer fentanyl, which she stole from the laboratory where she worked with her lover . Rossum was sentenced to life for killing her husband Gregory De Villers by poisoning him and covering him in rose petals, after he had threatened to expose her methamphetamine habit and her affair with Robertson. One month after the murder, Robertson flew back to Australia. Although he was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in Ms Rossum's murder trial, he was never charged, and has denied any involvement ever since. Dr Robertson, who now runs a forensic consulting service in Brisbane, told the Herald Sun that the Rose Petal case did come to mind when he was acting as an expert witness in the Baden-Clay trial. Dr Robertson himself has said friends used to joke that he was a walking advertisement for the negative consequences of an extramarital affair. Rossum claimed de Villers committed suicide, but she is currently an inmate at the Central Californian Women's Prison. Sentenced to life: Kristin Rossum, now aged 37 and incarcerated in the Central California Women's Facility, has Rossum has filed several petitions to overturn her conviction on first degree murder of her husband Greg De Villers, all of which have been denied. In 2006, De Villers¿ family sued Kristin and San Diego County in a wrongful-death suit, after learning that she was selling the rights to her story . But back in 2000, Rossum was a beautiful blonde scientist with a privileged background and a promising future. A former ballerina and child model who had grown up in the wealthy college suburb of Claremont, California, Rossum developed a methamphetamine habit as a schoolgirl. She met De Villers, a French American in 1995. He helped her get off drugs and they married in 1999. Meanwhile, she had started work at the Office of Medical Examiner (OME) in San Diego and was appointed as a toxicologist when she graduated with her degree in chemistry. Michael Robertson began work around the same time and was Rossum's supervisor. According to United States Court of Appeal evidence the pair began a sexual relationship in June 2000, and Rossum again began taking methamphetamines in October. On November 2, 200, De Villers confronted Rossum about the drug use and her affair, demanded she resign from her job or he would expose the facts to the OME. On the morning of November 6, she phoned her husband's workplace and called him in sick. She went to work, but returned to her apartment at lunchtime and was observed buying groceries. She was back and forth from the apartment, met up with Robertson and spent the afternoon with him, then returned home. It wasn't until 9.22pm she called 911 and reported De Villers was cold and not breathing. Paramedics found Rossum on the phone and her husband lying on the couple's bed, covered in rose petals. He was pronounced dead at 10.19pm and a San Diego medical examiner later concluded that he had been 'immobile and not breathing properly for approximately six to twelve hours prior to his death'. A decision was made to perform toxicology tests on De Villers outside the San Diego OME, to avoid a potential conflict of interest, but before the specimens were sent away some of them were handled by Dr Robertson. Gerard Baden-Clay was convicted on Tuesday of murdering his wife Allison and sentenced to life in prison . Nigel Baden-Clay (left) arrived at Wolston Correctional Centre to visit his son Gerard in prison in western Brisbane on Thursday . Tests showed that de Villers's organs contained extremely high concentrations of fentanyl, a painkiller up to 150 times more powerful than morphine, as well as a smaller amount of clonazepam, and a trace level of oxycodone, also known as 'hillbilly heroin'. The OME conducted an audit on its impounded drugs and discovered that fifteen fentanyl dermal patches and ten milligrams of fentanyl were missing. Their records showed Kristin Rossum had logged in the fentanyl standard and had worked on each of the three cases in which the missing fentanyl patches had been impounded. The OME also determined that quantities of methamphetamine, clonazepam, and oxycontin (a time-released form of oxycodone) were missing. Rossum told police her husband had committed suicide. Despite the suspicions of De Villers' family, San Diego police made no arrest. But in December, the San Diego OME fired Rossum and Robertson, and he returned to Australia. On June 25, 2001 San Diego police charged Kristin Rossum with murder. Her trial began in October 2002, with the defence counsel arguing De Villers had committed suicide by taking fentanyl because he was despondent over his marital problems. Prosecutors in Rossum’s trial alleged Dr Robertson helped his then-lover steal the fentanyl from the laboratory, which she administered to her husband to kill him. Evidence included passionate emails exchanged between Dr Robertson and Rossum, as well as computer files and professional writings revealing Dr Robertson’s specialist knowledge of fentanyl. The jury found her guilty and in December 2002, the court sentenced her to life without parole. Rossum has since filed several petitions to overturn her conviction, all of which have been denied. In 2006, Greg de Villers’ family sued Kristin and San Diego County in a wrongful-death suit, after learning that Kristin was selling the rights to her story. A San Diego jury ordered Rossum pay $100 million in punitive damages, which was reduced to $10m. After he returned to Australia, Dr Robertson has worked as a senior scientist and laboratory manager, as a toxicology consultant to industry and as an expert court witness. According to his company, Independent Forensic Consulting , Dr Robertson is 'one of  only a few independent, fully-trained and qualified clinical and forensic toxicologist’s practicing in Australia' He is 'an expert in drug and alcohol-related matters with over 20 years experience both nationally and internationally' and has 'been involved in some of the most complicated national and international cases and ...testifies regularly throughout Australia'.","Forensic toxicologist Michael Robertson was convicted Australian murderer Gerard Baden-Clay's expert defence witness .

"By . Candace Sutton . Gerard Baden-Clay was an 'arrogant and stony-faced' inmate on remand in Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre as he awaited trial for his wife's murder, but now faces having 'the crap beat out of him' in maximum security as he is processed as a sentenced prisoner. Fellow inmate Kelvin Lloyd, 40, told Daily Mail Australia the convicted wife killer had the respect of fellow inmates for one reason: They believed he was guilty. 'He pretended he was not guilty but he earned the respect of other inmates because they thought  he was guilty,' Mr Lloyd said. Baden-Clay, 43, will spend tonight in the 600-inmate Wolston Correctional Centre, which houses the likes of reviled child killer and paedophile Brett Peter Cowan, who has been in protective custody since he was convicted in March for murdering 13-year-old Daniel Morcombe . Baden-Clay played occasional racket ball, but otherwise kept to himself reading science fiction novels. Scroll down for video . Kelvin Lloyd, left, said convicted wife killer Gerard Baden-Clay was respected because other inmates thought he was guilty . Heavy duty: Gerard Baden-Clay was taken down into the cells beneath the Brisbane Supreme Court today after being pronounced guilty of murder and taken by prison van to the Wolston Correctional Centre (pictured) where he will live among 600 inmates in what is a maximum security protection prison for padeophiles, sex offenders and high profile prisoners . 'Air of authority': Gerard Baden-Clay projected an 'air of authority' while imprisoned awaiting his murder trial at Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre (pictured) in far western Brisbane where he spent two years on remand, says fellow inmate Kelvin Lloyd. Now that Baden-Clay has been sent to Wolston prison, he could face having 'the cr*p beaten out of him', Mr Lloyd says . CCTV footage of Gerard Baden-Clay at a supermarket on the last day his wife was seen alive . Mr Lloyd spent nine weeks on remand at the Arthur Gorrie facility at Wacol in Brisbane's far west, some of it in the B3 wing where Baden-Clay was housed. In an exclusive interview with Daily Mail Australia, he said the wife killer spent most of his time studying law books and filling out affidavits and forms related to his murder trial. 'He was stony faced and to a degree arrogant,' said Mr Lloyd, who spent nine weeks on remand for charges related traffic offences and receiving goods. 'He was by no means among the biggest or toughest in B3 [protection] wing, but he had an air of authority and the majority of prisoners respected him. 'I reckon it's because they believed he was guilty, even if he pretended he was not. 'Once I'd seen the photos of the scratches on his cheek, I knew he was guilty.' Doing time: Gerard Baden-Clay (pictured with his wife, Allison) spent time in his jail cell studying law books and filling out forms and affidavits leading up to his trial for Allison's murder, all to no avail. He spends tonight at the Wolston prison, a protection facility for sex offenders and high profile criminals . Eden Jessup, with her father Geoff, were some of the people who visited the memorial near Kholo Creek where Allison Baden-Clay's body was found on Tuesday . After the verdict was delivered, local residents paid tribute to the Brisbane mother by laying yellow flowers - her favourite colour - on a memorial . Family and friends of Allison Baden Clay joined police at Brisbane bar called The Guilty Rogue - down the road from the courthouse - to watch the news, including Geoff Dickie on right who is comforted by a friend . Mr Lloyd said Baden-Clay kept himself busy with 'heaps of mail' arriving at the prison, which related to his legal case, or with his nose in sci-fi novels. He said Baden-Clay's three daughters visited him at the Arthur Gorrie facility in the company of their paternal grandparents. He said the treatment Baden-Clay got from other inamtes at the centre would be different now he has been convicted and sentenced to a maximum of life in prison. After Baden-Clay's sentencing today, Queensland police blocked off the exit from the Brisbane Supreme Court with a police cordon and then an escort of police vehicles accompanied the prison van on its 22km journey from the court out to Wolston prison. Wolston is a maximum security 'protection' prison which houses paedophiles, sex offenders, convicted police officers and high profile prisoners like Baden-Clay. 'I reckon he'll get the crap beaten out of him,' Mr Lloyd told Daily Mail Australia. 'He's that high profile. They'll have to put him in isolation.' Inmates together: Gerard Baden-Clay will join reviled child killer and paedophile Brett Peter Cowan (pictured), who has been on deep protection inside Wolston Correctional Centre since being convicted in March of the 2003 murder of Sunshine Coast teenager, Danilel Morcombe .

"By . Candace Sutton . Police have released the last known photographs of murdered prostitute Valmai Jane Birch, whose mutilated remains were found in 2011 in a wheelie bin in the bathroom of her home at Woonona, north of Wollongong, NSW. Detectives have released the photographs in an appeal to the public for clues to the death of Ms Birch, whom neighbours heard screaming in the days before they reported a foul odour coming from her apartment. Ms Birch, 34, had moved to the Housing NSW unit not long before her death and was reportedly trying to cover from a drug addiction which had led her into a life of prostitution. Last photos: Police have received CCTV images of murdered woman Valmai Jane Birch captured by CCTV at Wollongong Railway station on the morning of March 2, 2011. Twelve days later, Ms Birch's mutilated remains were found dumped in a wheelie bin in her housing commission flat in Woonona, north of Wollongong NSW . Trying for a new life: Valmai Jane Birch (pictured) had not long moved into a flat in Woonona north of Wollongong in March 2011 to try and turn her life around, when the 33-year-old, whose drug addiction had forced her into prostitution, was found dead and dumped in a wheelie bin in her bathroom . At around 10pm on March 22, 2011, police from the Wollongong Local Area Command attended a unit block on Woods Avenue, Woonona, after residents reported a strong smell coming from the flat Ms Birch occupied. Upon entering the premises, officers found the mutilated remains of a woman in a wheelie bin inside the flat's bathroom. Forensic police said the body had been in the bin for several weeks and following the discovery of images of Ms Birch from CCTV cameras at Wollongong Railway Station, detectives have now been able to narrow down the time period in which she was murdered. Screams heard: neighbours in the unit block where Valmai Jane Birch died reported hearing 'a murderous sound' coming from her flat in the days leading up to their reporting a foul odour and police finding her body in a wheelie bin inside the residence. Police have now released the last images of |Ms Birch (pictured) caught on CCTV at Wollongong Railway station on March 9, 2011 . Collapsed on the street: Neighbours of the housing unit in Woods Avenue, Woonona (pictured) north of Woolongong where the mutilated remains of Valmai Jane Birch were found in March 2011, reported that she had collapsed on the street and noises were heard frequently coming from her flat . 'We believe Ms Birch was murdered between Wednesday 9 March and Monday 22 March 2011,' said Detective Acting Inspector Gunn from the Homicide Squad. Homicide Squad detectives and police from Wollongong Local Area Command, who formed Strike Force Gareth to investigate Ms Birch’s death, and are appealing for any clues or sightings of Ms Birch to help them solve her murder. The CCTV images were taken on March 9,  2011. 'We’re particularly keen to hear from anyone who saw or spoke to Ms Birch during February or March 2011,' Inspector Gunn said. 'It doesn’t matter how small or insignificant the information may seem, it could help us crack this case and bring whoever is responsible for Ms Birch’s death to justice. 'Please remember, information can be provided anonymously and will be treated confidentially.'","The body of Valmai Jane Birch, 34, was found in a wheelie bin in 2011 .

"By . Louise Cheer . and Candace Sutton . Queensland police who were investigating Allison Baden-Clay's death have revealed they bugged the flowers next to her coffin in the hope of luring a private confession from Gerard at her funeral. As Baden-Clay spent his first night in prison serving out a life sentence for killing his wife, police revealed how closely they scrutinised the man who yesterday was found guilty of murder in the Brisbane Supreme Court. The Courier Mail reports that police thought Baden-Clay might break down if he was alone with Allison's coffin, and offer a confession. Scroll down for video . Police bugged the flowers on Allison's coffin - but the plan was scuppered when Gerard arrived late to the service with their three daughters . Gerard with his daughters at Allison's funeral at Ipswich, west of Brisbane, in 2012 . Allison Baden-Clay's (centre) daughters are now under the care of her parents, Priscilla and Geoffrey Dickie . But his late arrival to the service with his children scuppered that plan, the paper reports. Police followed a number of leads - including grainy CCTV footage from the night of Allison's disappearance which may have shown her car at a roundabout near in Brisbane's west, and evidence which pointed to more than one person being near Kholo Creek, where her body was eventually discovered on April 30, 2012. Red marks on Baden-Clay's face proved to be the strongest lead for detectives as they charged him with his wife's murder. Baden-Clay told police he had cut himself shaving with a blunt razor because he was in a rush to get ready the morning of Allison's disappearance, but forensic experts testified in court they were more likely caused by fingernail scratches. Police also reveal they tapped phone calls between Baden-Clay and his mistress, Toni McHugh. It comes as A Current Affair reported that the Baden-Clays' three daughters - now left without a mother and a father - have been visiting Gerard behind bars at the Arthur Gorrie facility once a month in the lead-up to the trial, accompanied by their paternal grandparents. Once a month, since their father was charged and taken into custody, the girls have been visiting Baden-Clay behind bars in the Arthur Gorrie facility where he was being held, awaiting trial, A Current Affair reported. They were accompanied by their paternal grandparents. Gerard Baden-Clay was convicted of murdering his wife Allison and sentenced to life in prison with a non-parole period of 15 years . Allison's body was discovered at Kholo Creek, in Brisbane's west, and police say some evidence suggests that more than one person was seen nearby on the night she disappeared . Police say red marks on his face, possibly caused by fingernail scratches, proved to be the strongest evidence against Gerard Baden-Clay . In her witness impact statement, Allison's mother Priscilla Dickie said her granddaughters still wept over the loss of their mother. Ms Dickie said she and her husband, Geoffrey, were 'a happily retired couple involved in church and community activities' before their daughter's untimely death, but now their daily lives consisted of 'school days, special school events, and many before and after school activities'. '[The girls] resilience to this tragedy is a result of [Allison's] guidance and love,' Ms Dickie said. 'They miss her terribly and cry for her every night. 'They've been condemned to a life sentence without the love and companionship only a mother can give. 'What can you do or say when dealing with the stress of hugging a little girl saying: ""I want my mummy!"" and answering the question, ""Does mummy love me?""' Overnight, the horrific actions of Gerard Baden-Clay on April 19, 2012, left the girls motherless but on Tuesday a guilty verdict also took away their father. Allison Baden-Clay's daughters will now grow up under the care of her parents and sister, Vanessa Fowler, who has moved from the Gold Coast to be closer to her nieces in Brisbane. Allison's parents read out emotional impact statements in court, reflecting on the difficult road ahead for their three granddaughters . Dee Hudson and Roni Johnson are leading the charge to raise money for Allison's beloved children . To honour Allison, friends and family released yellow balloons - Allison's favourite colour - into the sky after the verdict was delivered . Chilling footage set to air on 60 Minutes shows Baden-Clay smiling, giggling and saying 'everything is going to be all right' The court heard, Ms Fowler had 'willingly' taken up the responsibility to be one of the sole carers of the Baden-Clay children by uprooting her own family - including her husband and two kids - to help her parents look after the three girls. 'My role in the family has changed from being the eldest daughter to being a support and carer of my three nieces,' she said in her victim impact statement. Outside court the family's close friend, Kerry Anne Walker, said: 'Our primary concern has always been and remains the physical and emotional wellbeing of Allison's three beautiful girls.' 'We will help them to rebuild their lives and ask for your support, co-operation and privacy in order to do this. 'We have a long way to go to ensure that they will cope with a future without their mother.' But support will not just come from immediate family members. Allison's badly decomposed body was found on a bank near a bridge on Brisbane's Kholo Creek . A permanent memorial stone to Allison Baden-Clay was erected by her family after her body was discovered at a creek in Brisbane's west . Gerard Baden-Clay says a blunt razor caused him to nick his face while shaving in a hurry on the morning his wife disappeared . Detectives found traces of blood in the boot of Allison's car when they did a sweep at the family home . As their mother - who has been described as a 'quiet achiever' by friends - gave to the community, they will return the favour by helping Allison's daughters through this difficult time. Dee Hudson and Roni Johnson are two people who are part of the efforts to raise money for the children of the devoted mother and keeping her legacy alive. 'Alison was just like us - she was a mother, she was a daughter, she was wife,' Ms Hudson, a school friend, told A Current Affair. 'I felt distressed for her children. 'I want to...let those little girls start seeing their mum's light shining in the public eye.' To honour their friend, Ms Hudson and Ms Johnson are urging people to wear yellow on August 1 for Wear Yellow Day for Allison and Strive to be Kind.

"By . Candace Sutton . A former offshore processing official says refugee advocates are encouraging asylum seekers in Australia's immigration detention centres to self harm so the advocates can use the incidents for their own political agenda. Greg Lake told Mailonline a handful of 'extreme' refugee campaigners coached 'ringleaders' in detention centres who stood over more vulnerable asylum seekers, forcing them to sew their lips together, make suicide attempts and harm themselves to gain publicity for the advocates' cause. 'Then these advocates are ready with a media release to promote their cause,' he said, 'they often know about the incident before the minister or the department does and that's because they organised it.' He said the practice was confined to a minority of advocates, but that it was 'despicable'. Scroll down for video . 'Despicable' acts: Whistleblower Greg Lake, a former immigration department manager on Nauru, says that a small number of 'extremist' refugee advocates are coaching ringleaders in island detention centres to induce vulnerable asylum seekers to self harm all for the political agenda of refugee campaigners back in Australia . Christmas Island detention centre (pictured) where refugee advocates say at least ten women attempted suicide this week, a claim which has since come intodoubt . Tragic death: Asylum seekers on Manus Island hold a photograph of Reza Berati, the 23-year-old Iranian man, who died in a violent clash at the island's detention centre in February. Former immigration official Greg Lake says actions by extreme refugee advocates to pus their political barrow caused the fatal riot . Staged riot: A violent clash between asylum seekers house on Manus Island detection centre (pictured), north of Papua New Guinea, was the result of extremist refugee advocates encouraging violence to further their political cause back in Australia . 'I'm not saying this is the majority of advocates - most refugee advocates are genuinely interested in giving a voice to the voiceless and making people aware of the circumstances around asylum seekers. 'However there are some who do and I am sure that this is what happened before the violent protest on Manus Island which resulted in the death of Reza Berati.' 'In reality there is a lot of self harm by detainees in immigration detention centres which is due to mental health issues which they experience while in detention. 'But some high profile advocates are using people to prey on the more vulnerable among them to lip sewing and other harming activities.' Mr Berati was killed on February 17 during a riot inside the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea. Political agenda: Greg Lake (pictured) says that while most refugee advocates genuinely care about giving refugees a voice, but that an unscrupulous few entice ringleaders to stand over more vulnerable asylum seekers, forcing them to sew their lips together, make suicide attempts and harm themselves to gain publicity for the advocates' cause . The 23-year-old Iranian allegedly died after he was beaten with a wooden stick and kicked, before being hit on the head with a rock, during a confrontation between detainees and PNG locals in which 62 people were injured. Mr Lake is a former Department of Immigration regional manager who once worked in Nauru detention centre. He resigned in December 2012 and has since been critical of both sides in the immigration and asylum seeker debate. Greg Lake said the actions of the extremist refugee advocates were 'at odds with their mandate'. He was responding to questions about a claim by the Refugee Action Coalition that ten women in detention on Christmas Island had attempted suicide this week so that their orphaned babies might be brought up in Australia. The Australian reported the Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul had 'backed down' from his earlier claimed that '10 mothers in the family camp have attempted suicide in the last two days on Christmas Island'. The newspaper quoted Mr Rintoul as saying he 'probably shouldn't have said attempted suicide' because 'people drinking concoctions of shampoo or detergent generally don’t die — was it a drastic cry for help? Yes, it was, and it remains that way'. Mr Rintoul told Mailonline that his apparent 'backdown' was nothing of the sort and had arisen out of a discussion about how the incident should have been reported. 'I am not resiling from what took place and that is self harm,' he told Mailonline. 'There are degrees of self harm. Some people slash their stomachs, some people drink concoctions. 'They drank shampoo, cut themselves, attempted to cut themselves. Drinking shampoo can kill you. 'Probably if I'd said ten women were self harming, there isn't any distinction between self harming and suicide.' Christmas Island: Claims of women attempting suicide in Christmas Island detention centre this week so that their orphaned children could become residents of Australia appear to have been exaggerated. The island which lies in the Indian Ocean 2600km northwest of Perth attracts boats like the vessel pictured off the island's Flying Fish Cove in August, 2011, from nearby neighbouring countries such as Indonesia . The detention centre on Christmas Island (above) opened in 2001 and now houses more than 1200 asylum seekers who arrived on boats from Indonesia and other neighbouring countries . Island detention: asylum seekers at Manus Island detention centre (pictured) attempt self harm because of mental health issues, but some are induced by the political agendas of extremist refugee advocates . Mr Rintoul denied encouraging individuals to self harm for his own political agenda. 'It's the system which encourages self harm,' he said, 'it breeds anxiety. 'I don't know individuals who actually self harmed. I do know some of the families. I got calls after the event.' Mr Rintoul said it was impossible for him or other advocates to call into detention centres, but that detainees could call them. He said Mr Lake's claims about advocates coaching detainees to self harm was 'sheer fantasy'. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has denied the claims that mothers had attempted suicide on Christmas Island so their children could gain Australian residency. Up to 14 female asylum seekers on self-harm watch were being monitored by female staff, Christmas Island shire councillor Gordon Thomson told AAP . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison is advised female staff are on hand to help women placed on watch when they are undertaking 'personal care tasks'.The level of monitoring varies, depending on the individual circumstances.'The wellbeing, safety and security of all people in immigration detention is of paramount importance,' a spokesman for Mr Morrison said in a statement to AAP.","Refugee advocate 'backs down' on Christmas Island suicide claims .

"Duffy has Asperger sydnrome and lived with his beautician Mum Leah in the country town of Kingaroy . Leah says her son is better hacker than state's best cyber crime detective but he's no criminal . A 21-year-old home-schooled computer expert from the Queensland town of Kingaroy - north-west of Brisbane - has been charged with possessing $110,000 of Bitcoins he allegedly obtained during a cyber attack police say he made on the giant US gaming site Riot Games. Police allege Shane Stephen Duffy hacked into the game, League of Legends, which has more than 67 million players across the world, on a laptop at his mum's place in Kingaroy - otherwise known as the peanut capital of Australia. The charges against Duffy come after a combined investigation by a specialist police cyber crime and identity unit in tandem with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In August 2013, Riot Games was forced to reset League of Legends player passwords in North America, causing widespread online fury. The company announced that 120,000 transaction records and credit card data had been stolen. Shane Duffy (above, left) of the tiny Queensland town of Kingaroy is facing fraud and hacking charges related to League of Legends (right), which was created by US gaming giant, Riot Games, and has more than 67 million players worldwide . Digital currency: Police allege Shane Duffy acquired the currency Bitcoins while hacking into Riot Games' League of Legends selling information to players. He allegedly earned up to $1000 a week . Online fury: Tens of thousands of players of League of Legends allegedly had to change their passwords and online security information after the game was disrupted by a hacking scheme . He is facing fraud and hacking charges related to League of Legends, which was created by US gaming giant, Riot Games. Detectives from Queensland's Hi-tech Crime and Investigation Unit have now raided properties in the  towns of Kingaroy, Poona and Hervey Bay investigating the alleged computer offences. Following the seizure of laptops and a hard drive in Kingaroy last November, Queensland police  spent several months forensically examining items and found others located within an 'encrypted container'. Shane Duffy is due to face Maryborough Magistrates Court on July 22 on two counts of fraud by dishonestly obtaining property from another, one count of fraud by dishonestly causing detriment, one count of possessing equipment for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of an offence, and three counts of using restricted computers. Laptop legend: Police will allege in the Maryborough Magistrates Court that 21-year-old Shane Duffy used a laptop while living at his Mum's place to commit computer hacking and fraud on the League of Legends game (above) which has more than 67 million players world wide . Outback hacker: Queensland cyber crime police says the case of alleged hacking of the giant gaming site League of Legends which investigators will tell a court next month originated in small town of Kingaroy, 210km north-west of Brisbane, showed that hackers did not have to own numerous computers and sophisticated equipment, but could just be a kid with a laptop living with his Mum . Peanut capital: alleged computer hacker Shane Duffy lived in the town of Kingaroy also known as the peanut capital of Australia for the country's largest peanut processing plant and silos (pictured) Bitcoin is a payment system which records financial transactions on a public ledger. No actual tangible currency exists, however users of the system can send and receive bitcoins electronically in exchange for products, and services. Although the legitimacy of bitcoins has been questioned and banking authorities warn it lacks consumer protections, it has grown in popularity as a form of payment. One incentive to accept the digital currency is that its fees are lower than those of credit card companies. He will also face Hervey Bay Magistrates Court on July 24 on charges of tainted property relating to the bitcoins and breach of bail offences. Duffy, who has a Californian girlfriend he met online, is a computer genius but totally innocent according to his mother, Kingaroy beauty therapist Leah Duffy. Ms Duffy has defended her son saying the Queensland Police had 'the wrong man'. She said her son, who had been home-schooled since fourth year due to his suffering from Asperger syndrome, which caused him difficulty in normal social interactions, but allowed him to be highly skilled in introverted activities, such as in mathematics, Tech Times reported. Since Duffy has been out of school, he stayed home most of the time and taught himself all about computers.Ms Duffy said her son indeed was a computer whiz and had more computer knowledge than Queensland's best cyber detective, but that he did not commit those cyber crimes. She said any information Duffy had was readily available on the internet for free, and that it was someone else who had made the hacked database public. Police alleged Duffy hacked the servers of Riot Games and was able to acquire player details and details on IP addresses, and sold them all online, which allowed players of Legend of Leagues to slow down their opponents' playing abilities which made them more vulnerable to being 'killed' or eliminated from the game. Screenshots of the data were allegedly uploaded from Riot Games' Twitter account, allowing a profit of up to $1000 a week selling IP addresses. Detective Superintendent Brian Hay of the Hi-tech Crime Investigation Unit said in April the case showed alleged hacking threats could originate anywhere, and were not necessarily a skilled hacker working with multiple computers an sophisticated equipment. Earlier this year Duffy was denied access to computers as part of his bail conditions. An application by Duffy in April to change his bail conditions because he needed computer access to speak to his girlfriend and complete a TAFE course was refused because of the seriousness of the nine charges.

Peter Holmes a Court has married his fiancee, American photographer Alissa Everett, in Botswana following the African train crash tragedy in which one of their wedding guests were killed. The millionaire Australian businessman has posted a message to 'our friends' on his Facebook page about the wedding and included a photograph of his bride's bruised and stitched hand. He has also paid tribute to American Will Poovey, who died in the crash, saying his new wife loved the 44-year-old 'like a brother'. Ms Everett also posted on Facebook about Mr Poovey and his wife Kara who was injured in the crash: 'Their love over 18 years of marriage was an inspiration for me. Perhaps I hadn't got married because I hadn't met my Will Poovey'. And the bride wore stitches: the photograph of his new wife Alissa Everett's hand posted by Peter Holmes a Court following the train crash in Zimbabwe which killed one of their wedding guests. Holmes a Court and Everett have now quietly married in Botswana . You rlove is an inspiration: Alissa Everett paid tribute to friend Will Poovey (pictured with his wife, Kara and their two children) who died from head injuries following the crash. She wrote on Facebook, 'Their love over 18 years of marriage was an inspiration for me. Perhaps I hadn't got married because I hadn't met my Will Poovey' Moments before the crash: With the groom to be Peter Holmes a Court in the background, a smiling Will and Kara Poovey are photographed in the tourist tram near Victoria Falls enjoying themselves. Tragedy struck at around 5pm when the tram was hit by a goods train and Mr Poovey sustained fatal head injuries and later died in hospital. Mrs Poovey is still recovering from her injuries . Alissa Everett and Peter Holmes have now married quietly following the  train crash in Zimbabwe in which one of their wedding guests died . The newlyweds photographed their ceremony, and Ms Everett's injured hand, using the late Mr Poovey's camera - with the permission of his widow, Kara Poovey. The Facebook message reads, 'We would like our friends to know to following. 'We are happy to be married, yet our hearts are broken for the loss of our dear friend. 'We were involved in an accident in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe when our tourist tram was hit by a goods train. 20 people were injured, two serious, and one died as a result of the injury. 'We are OK. Bruised, cut, stitched and strapped. These will fade and heal. 'Many others were hurt worse than us and, as a group, we were very, very lucky. 'On that tragic night, we witnessed so much bravery, but the world lost one of its best in Will Poovey. Alissa loved him like a brother, and Peter is honored that he had blessed our union. 'His wife Kara—as Will well knew—is an angel on this earth with us. She had a small operation in Johannesburg and continues to light up the room with her teary smile. Peter Holmes a Court and Alissa Everett (pictured) had asked guests to donate gifts to build houses for women and children in the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of which will be named in honour of American Willl Poovey who died in the crash . African media ran pictures of the freight train which crashed into the tourist tram carrying Peter Holmes a Court's wedding guests in Zimbabwe on Tuesday, July 1 . 'The tragic events has given us such incredible respect for Kara, and we send our love to Kara, Carson and Coco Poovey. 'Kara requested that we rejoin our group in Botswana and gave us Will’s camera. She insisted we honor Will by following through with our wedding ceremony and filling the camera with beautiful photographs. 'The wedding took place as planned, smaller and quieter without Will. Good will come from this if we rise to the challenge of living life as Will did: making the most of every day, adding laughter and joy to every room we enter, and deeply loving those close to us. Wedding guests on the side of the Victoria Falls railway embankment in Zimbabwe last week in the aftermath of the train crash . 'Guests and friends of the wedding have already raised over $17,000 to fund Safe Houses in DR Congo for survivors of sexual violence. One of the houses will be dedicated in the name of the Poovey family. 'We’ll take our honeymoon next year, when smiles come easier.' Millionaire Jason Gissing, who was to be Holmes a Court's best man, was flown to South Africa after breaking his arm and a leg in the crash . The crash happened on July 1 when a goods train ploughed into a National Railways of Zimbabwe tram that was carrying 30 tourists and 5 crew members at the Victoria Falls main station. He said the passengers on the tram were from the US, UK, the Netherlands and Australia. They were staying at the Victoria Falls Hotel at the time of the accident and sightseeing ahead of the wedding. Of the 20 injured, 18 were treated at the local hospital and two were flown to a hospital in Johannesberg where one of them died. The best man of Mr Holmes a Court, Jason Gissing, is a friend from his Oxford University days, where he also met George Osborne, Britain's finance minister. His family has close ties with Zimbabwe - Mr Holmes a Court's father, the late entrepreneur Robert, grew up in the African country. 'It is the most appalling disaster,' an associate of Mr Gissing said. 'Jason broke an arm and a leg. It’s very traumatic, but at least he is alive. 'He is being cared for by Professor Ken Boffard, who is one of the best trauma surgeons in the world.' Mr Gissing was airlifted to Johannesburg, in neighbouring South Africa, for treatment. Ms Everett is an award-winning American photographer who has covered conflicts in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Peter Holmes a Court (right, with Russell Crowe) is cancelled his wedding after the train crash in Zimbabwe, but has since quietly married Alissa Everett in Botswana . Last year she photographed Peter Holmes a Court for a magazine article about his return to Zimbabwe to trace the history of his father, Robert, who died in 1990. For their wedding gifts, she and Peter Holmes a Court asked that guests give monetary donations to a charity Ms Everett founded for women and children in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Prior to getting married in Zimbabwe, Holmes a Court intended to accompany Ms Everett on a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where in 2012 she was 'violently ambushed'. 'I will be joining to carry her (heavy) camera bags, to write on her work, raise the profile of the projects and because I am not prepared to let my bride out of my sight,' he said in a post on their wedding gift registry site. American Will Poovey was killed in the accident, which happened last week at Victoria Falls (above), near the beauty spot on the border with Zambia . Zimbabwe's railways are notoriously dangerous, with the country's economy unable to pay for improvements. Pictured: A train hurtles along the tracks at Victoria Falls where the latest crash occurred . Mr Holmes a Court became executive chairman of South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2006 in a joint takeover with Gladiator star Russell Crowe. After becoming CEO, he quit the post in 2008. He and Crowe currently own a 37.5 per cent share of the NRL club. His close friend Mr Gissing, 43, is the co-founder of UK-based online grocer Ocado.  He stepped down from the board earlier this year, cashing in $27 million worth of shares. Mr Gissing is married to Norwegian former professional skier Katinka. They live in a $8 million house in London’s Bayswater with their four children. Zimbabwe’s railways are notoriously dangerous, with ageing despot Robert Mugabe having brought the country’s economy to its knees and unable to pay for improvements. The accident is the third involving National Railways of Zimbabwe in the space of a week. The National Railways of Zimbabwe spokesman declined to comment on whether legal action had been launched against it following the crash.","Peter Holmes a Court and fiancee Alissa Everett have married in Africa .

"By . Candace Sutton . A pool cleaner and maintenance man to Sydney's eastern suburbs and north shore has become Australia's first convicted 'sexter' after he sent explicit photographs and videos to women clients suggesting what he'd like to do to them in their backyard swimming pools. Peter Lewis Sheather pleaded guilty in Sydney's Downing Centre Court to nine charges of sending text messages on his iPhone 5 depicting nudity and lewd acts. The 41-year-old sent the messages to eight Sydney womenwho were customers of two pool maintenance firms, Pool Doctor Services of Roseville on Sydney's upper north shore and Swim Art in Rose Bay, in the eastern suburbs. Sexting offender: Peter Lewis Sheather, pictured leaving the Downing Centre court last month . Explicit messages: Pool cleaner Peter Sheather, 41, (pictured) pleaded guilty in the Downing Centre Court in Sydney to sending messages on his Apple iPhone5 to women who were clients of two pool firms in Sydney eastern suburbs and upper north shore suggesting what he'd like to do to them in their backyard swimming pools . Pool owner victims: Convicted 'sexter' Peter Sheather targeted women customers of Swim Art in Rose Bay and Pool Doctor Services in Roseville in March and April this year with suggestive text messages and explicit photos and videos of naked men involved in sex acts . Sheather worked for both companies as a pool cleaner and used the women clients' mobile numbers plus intimate details about them and their backyard pools in text messages on a secret iPhone account he had obtained under a false name. Most of the calls originated in the upmarket Sydney suburbs of Bellevue Hill and Paddington. He also pleaded guilty to sending images of a naked man engaged in a sex act to a woman he met on the dating site Plenty of Fish. Police facts tendered at the court say Sheather's sexting campaign which caused 'fear and offence' against the eight women pool owners began on March 4 this year when he sent a text to a woman named Sheila at at 12.29pm saying, 'Hey u. Did you get my photo this morning'. 21st century crime: Peter Lewis Sheather (pictured leaving Downing Centre Court after pleading guilty to nine 'sexting' charges) will receive psychological counselling before his sentencing in August. He harassed women pool owners in Sydney's eastern suburbs and upper north shore with lurid messages and images . A second text to Sheila on March 14 at 7.12pm said in part, 'I'd love to f*** you in your pool ... Sheila'. Police say the text frightened and offended the victim due to its 'overtly sexual nature' and the fact it shows the accused knows the victim's name and the fact the victim has a pool which cannot be seen from the street'. Sheather's next victim was a woman named Brittany who on March 7 at 7.03am he texted a message with 'a picture of a male standing naked with a semi-erect penis'. The head and face of the man could not be seen in the photo. The accompanying message read, 'Shower time. Wanna join me honey?' Peter Sheather: Hey sexy Liz. How's u? Liz: Fine. How r u and who r u . PS: it's simon. Didn't you save my number? Liz: Simon who . PS: Have u seriously forgotten . Liz: I know a lot of people called Simon . PS: Well we haven't been intimate lol. That narrow it down? Liz: Not really . PS: Would a pic help?? Liz: Yep as long as it ain't intimate . PS: Meaning not of my c*** . Liz: Yeah you'd probably need a zoom lens anyway . PS: Like you big t*** . Liz: F*** off . PS: Don't be like that Liz Let me [words removed here by Mailonline] and f*** u in your pool . At 1.05pm on the same day he texted the same photograph and message to his third victim. About a week later, at 11.56am on March 14, he texted her again saying, 'Hey sexy Kristina. How's your week honey?' On the evening of that day he sent a message to victim four, Nicole, saying in part, 'I'd love to f*** u in your pool ... Nicole'. On the same morning a woman called Margaret became victim number five when he texted her at 10.32am saying in part, 'I'd love to f*** u in your pool ... Maggie'. On the morning of March 19, a woman called Elizabeth became unwittingly involved in a text 'conversation' with Sheather after he sent her a message saying, 'Hey sexy Liz. How's u?'. Not knowing who sent the message, she replied, 'Fine. How r u and who r u?' The texts went back and forth for almost three hours until Sheather suggested he sent a photograph, mentioned his 'c***' and mentioned her 'big t***' and suggested she let him 'f*** u in your pool'. That evening Sheather texted his seventh victim, a woman named Nicole, saying, 'Hey sexy Gal. How's your week been? Did you work today or lazed at home.' Awaiting sentencing: Peter Lewis Sheather (above) pleaded guilty to nine charges of using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend before Magistrate Jane Culver, who ordered him to undergo psychological assessment before he is sentenced in August . Shower time: Peter Lewis Sheather's lewd text messages to eight women customers of two Sydney pool maintenance businesses including Pool Doctor (above). The messages included one he sent to two different women saying, 'Shower time. Wanna join me honey?' Nicole did not answer because she believed the message was spam, however just over seven hours later, at 1.47am on March 20, Sheather sent her a 15 second long video which police say 'depicted an erect penis being masturbated and ejaculating' with a message saying, 'Nicky McSticky?'. Sheather's last victim was a woman called Catherine, who he texted at 5.30pm on April 10 saying, 'I'd love to take to [sic] downstairs and f*** your brains out in your pool while you look over the harbour'. Meanwhile, police say Sheather had similarly sent sexually explicit messages to a woman he had met on the dating website Plenty of Fish in November 2012, introducing himself as 'Rick Smithe'. The friendship ceased a month later after, police say, Sheather sent the woman, Deborah, 'a multimedia text message ... containing a photo of a penis ejaculating'. He contacted her again in January, 2013, to try and arrange a meeting but Deborah refused saying she 'did not feel comfortable'. At 7pm on March 11 this year, Deborah received a text from 'Rick's' mobile saying, 'Hello stranger' to which she did not reply. Sheather then sent her a text 'Want you so bad Deb' accompanied by a video she did not look at. She sent back a text saying, 'Taking my phone straight to the police station', to which he responded, 'You do that'. Deborah texted back, 'What is your problem? Don't you ever contact me again you disgusting pig'. After she contacted police at Maitland Local Area Command in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney, officers viewed the footage which they said 'consisted of a hand masturbating an erect penis and the penis ejaculating'. They telephoned Sheather and asked him for his date of birth and other personal details, which he refused, saying when officers told him they would identify him by other means, 'Well f***ing do it' before hanging up. At 7.30pm on April 23, police stopped Sheather in Vaucluse, in Sydney's eastern suburbs and asked if he owned an Apple iPhone 5, which he denied ever having. At 10.45am the following day officers executed a search warrant on his apartment in Cammeray, on Sydney's North Shore, where they found an Apple IPhone 5 charger in the bedroom plus a docket for its purchase, and seized a laptop. Sheather again denied owning an iPhone5, but after being taken to North Sydney Police Station he 'made a full and frank admission to all offences'. He told police the photos and videos were not of himself but that he had found them on the internet. He told police he had destroyed the iPhone just days earlier by smashing the iPhone 5 with a hammer and throwing it into a bin on New South Head Road in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Double Bay. He said he had thrown the SIM card from his car while driving through nearby Bellevue Hill. Mr Sheather pleaded guilty before Deputy Chief Magistrate Jane Culver to nine counts of using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend. Ms Culver agreed to continue his bail while he underwent psychological counselling and assessment for eight weeks. He will be sentenced on August 14. Mr Sheather told Mailonline outside the court he had 'no comment' about his offences.","A Sydney pool cleaner is the first Australian convicted of 'sexting'

"By . Ruth Styles . Sheila Thomas, now 64, was just 17 when, on Boxing Day 1967, she gave birth to her much-loved baby daughter Jacqueline. But as an unmarried mother at a time when single parenthood was frowned upon, she had just six weeks with her child before she was taken away from her forever. Now, almost half a century on, Sheila says she has never been able to have other children because she 'didn't deserve to'. Scroll down for video . Reunited: Sheila Thomas, right, was forced to give up her daughter Jacqui when she was just six weeks old . 'I knew . that I couldn’t [have children] because I would be a bad mother,' she says, tears welling up in her eyes. 'I don’t . deserve children. I gave one away, how could I? I just gave her away . without a fight. 'I . don’t see myself as a mother now, I can’t see myself as a mother,' she continues. 'I . haven’t had that real opportunity of bringing a child up all through the . trials and tribulations that kids go through. I haven’t done it.' Sheila, who now lives in Sussex, was born and brought up in a south London semi, where she lived with her mother, father, two brothers and grandmother. 'My life now is a world away from where I grew up,' she explains. 'We lived in a three up two down in south London and there was my mum and my dad, myself, my two brothers and my nan in the front room, which meant we only had the back room for the five of us. It was tight, it was tight.' Tragic: Like Philomena Lee, whose life was turned into a film, Sheila never gave up hope of finding Jacqui . Sad: Although the real Philomena's search ended sadly, Sheila got a happy ending . Aged 15, she left school and got a job as a receptionist. But it wasn't long before she found herself caught up in a relationship with an older married man. 'I was bowled over by him,' she remembers. 'I felt like a silly schoolgirl. It was exciting. The whole situation took us both by surprise, I think. He was the one. I fell completely in love with him.' But within a year of striking up the relationship, Sheila discovered that she was pregnant. 'I was 17 and I was frightened,' she says. 'My boyfriend was married so I couldn't turn to him. I couldn't ask him for help. I thought, ""This can't be happening, it can't be true"". 'When the time came and I couldn't hide it any longer, I had to finally face my parents. I told them and I had no idea what was going to happen. But mum and dad, they took charge.' She broke up with her boyfriend and gave up her job, while her parents found a mother and baby home for her to go to. On Boxing Day 1967, she gave birth to her baby daughter, Jacqueline. 'It was amazing when I first held her,' remembers Sheila. 'I thought, ""Wow! I, me, have had a baby. I just need to look after this child now. That bond. It's so strong. It didn't dawn on me that that child would be taken away from me.' Unbeknown to Sheila, her parents had made arrangements to have the baby given up for adoption and when the time came, she felt she had no alternative but to go along with their plans. 'A lady came in from the side and she said I'm going to take your child now,' she remembers. 'And she picked her up and I said: ""Are you going to keep her name?""' Coldly, the woman replied: 'I can't tell you that.' And with that, Sheila's baby was gone. 'The double doors opened and she was gone,' says Sheila. 'That's when it dawns on you, she has gone. 'I don't know how I could have done it, how I could have gone along with it,' she adds. 'I should have said, ""Mum, come on. We can make this work, other people do it, why can't we?"" But I never did, I never said it.' 10 years later, Sheila met and married her husband David and moved to Sussex, But the couple never had children of their own. Notorious: Mother and baby homes such as this one in Chester were once to be found all over the country . 'David and I found each other and before . we got engaged, we said we didn't want children. I felt that it would be slightly . disrespectful to Jacqueline. 'How could I have a child and give her away? How could I have done it?' But things are finally looking up for Sheila after she was reunited with her daughter with the help of ITV documentary, Long Lost Family. Jacqueline, who much to Sheila's delight is still called Jacqueline, lives in Kent with her 13-year-old daughter and says that she believes her mother did the right thing. 'I've always known [I was adopted],' she says. 'I cannot remember a . time when I was sat down and told. The right thing . happened for me and it all worked out well.' 'I knew immediately it was her,' said a delighted Sheila immediately after their reunion. 'Her eyes lit up when she saw me and she held out her arms to me and that was the best hug ever. 'I just want to be a little part in her life, just a little bit in the background,' she continued. 'It's time we go forward now.' Sheila and Jacqueline appear on Long Lost Families, tonight at 9pm on ITV .","Sheila Thomas, now 64, was 17 when she had to give up her daughter .

"By . Ruth Styles . Stylish in a pair of on-trend print trousers and a simple white t-shirt, Spain's Queen Letizia was every inch the chic holidaymaker as she arrived in Mallorca for a break with her husband King Felipe and two daughters. Smiling broadly, the royal couple exchanged quips and smiles as they posed for pictures with their children, Leonor, Princess of Asturias, eight, and Infanta Sofia, seven, on the steps of the Marivient Palace in Palma de Mallorca. The two little princesses, dressed in matching bright pink and mint green frocks, were initially bashful but soon joined their parents as they met well-wishers who had waited outside the palace to see them. Scroll down for video . Lovely: Queen Letizia and King Felipe of Spain cuddle up to their daughters Leonor (green dress) and Sofia . Close family: The royal couple and their daughters are beginning their annual family holiday in Mallorca . Traditional: The Spanish royals have made a habit of spending summer on the hugely popular Balearic island . While the infamous resort of Magaluf is less than 12 miles away, royal holidays on the Spanish party island of Mallorca tend to be more sedate. Instead of lines of jager bombs and drunken fumbles on balconies, the Spanish royals spend most of the time on their yacht, Fortuna, and the rest enjoying private dinners or wandering through the winding streets of the pretty Mallorcan capital. Although, unlike the Queen's summer residence Balmoral, the Marvient is publicly owned, the royals' Mallorcan holiday is considered family time and rarely do visiting heads of state get to see inside. One group of visitors who did get to see inside, however, were the Prince of Wales and the late Princess Diana, who joined the Spanish royals for a holiday in Mallorca in 1988. Looks familiar: Charles and Diana posed on the same steps during their 1988 visit - as did Prince Felipe (right) Happy memories: The Prince of Wales, Prince Harry and Princess Diana on the steps of the Marvient Palace .

Close family: King Felipe affectionately strokes Infanta Leonor's cheek as their Mallorcan family holiday begins .

Like Queen Letizia and King Felipe, they joined former King Juan-Carlos and his wife Queen Sophia for photographs on the steps of the palace, along with their children - a three-year-old Prince Harry and a five-year-old William. The British royals also spent time on Fortuna, with Prince Charles photographed teaching Harry how to swim under the watchful gaze of fellow guest, King Constantine of Greece. While Queen Letizia and King Felipe won't be getting a visit from the British royals this summer, they will be spending time with their daughters and splashing around in the sea. Although a visit to Magaluf is unlikely, the royal pair are expected to travel to other parts of the island with Pollença in the north and the wine-growing town of Felanitx among likely destinations. Royal duties: After posing for photographs, the couple shook hands with waiting well-wishers and journalists . Happy family: The two young princesses were on their best behaviour as they met well-wishers . Family resemblance: The two princesses and their mother Queen Letizia closely resemble one another .

"By . Ruth Styles . It's not often that the Queen comes face to face with fellow female ruler but during a visit to an agricultural show in Scotland today, she was shown several. Unfortunately for the apiarists, the monarch looked less than impressed with the miniscule Queen Bees, apparently preferring the cattle instead. Once inside the parade ring, she was brought up short by an encounter an enormous white bull but appeared to enjoy the experience, beaming broadly as she presented its owner with a silver cup. Can you see the queen bee? The Queen looks less than impressed as she inspects a hive of honeybees . Congratulations: The Queen presents a farmer with the Champion of Champions trophy at the Turriff Show . The Queen is currently on her traditional summer break at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire but will lead tributes to the fallen of World War I during a special memorial service in Crathie Kirk tonight. Today is the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War and the moment is being marked with memorial services across the UK, France and Belgium. The monarch has taken a low key role in the Great War centenary commemorations, letting the Prince of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge take the lead at home and abroad in contrast to June's D-Day anniversary. Then, the Queen took centre stage, appearing at a ceremony with President Obama and President Hollande of France at Sword Beach and laying a wreath at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Enjoying the day: The Queen was all smiles as she toured the Turriff show ground in Aberdeenshire . At ease: The Queen didn't bat an eyelid when confronted with an enormous white bull during her visit . Lovely: The Queen appeared to be impressed with the gorgeous flowers lined up in one of the marquees . This time, her contribution will be . limited to a service at Crathie Kirk, a church on the Balmoral Estate, while the Duke of Edinburgh will do the same at Sandringham. 'The Prince of Wales and The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are representing The Queen today in Glasgow and Belgium respectively, at the events to mark the centenary of the First World War,' said a Buckingham Palace spokesperson when approached by MailOnline. 'The Queen is often represented on official visits by Members of the Royal Family - in fact throughout her reign, Her Majesty has been supported by members of the Royal Family to assist her in public duties.' With the Queen in Aberdeenshire, it was Prince William who led tributes the Belgian civilians who died in the opening hours of the conflict during a service in Liège. Speaking to an audience that included Spain's King Felipe, German president Joachim Gauck and King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of the Belgians, the Duke thanked the Belgian people for their resistance . to the invasion 100 years ago, saying: . 'Their resistance was as gallant as their suffering was great.' Something for later? The Queen looked thrilled as she was shown a stall selling local sausages and burgers . Praise: Kate looks solemn as William gets up to make a speech in which he paid tribute to the Belgian sacrifice . Watchful: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and President Hollande look on as the ceremony begins . Later, the Duke and Duchess are expected to join Prince Harry for a memorial service at St Symphorien . Military Cemetery near Mons. Two . kilometres outside the city centre, it contains the graves of 229 . British and Commonwealth soldiers and 284 Germans, the majority of whom . were killed during the Battle of Mons - the first major British battle . of the war. Mons, . which saw a British attempt to hold the Mons–Condé Canal fail after a . sudden French retreat, lasted for more than two weeks. Although . the German army came close to taking Paris, British and French . victories in the Battle of the Marne that followed saw the invaders . pushed back before the war got bogged down in stalemate and trenches. Tribute: Prince Harry began the day in Folkestone, where he took part in a memorial parade along The Leas . How do you do? Prince Harry makes another new friend during his visit to the port of Folkestone in Kent . Memorial: Harry was following in the footsteps of the men who embarked on boats to France from the port . The . men who died in them were also remembered by Prince Harry earlier this . morning when he took part in a parade through Kent port of Folkestone. Folkestone . was a key embarkation point for men heading to the trenches, with many . travelling along a route, now renamed the 'Road of Remembrance', that . took them down the Leas and past the seafront to the ramps from which . they boarded the boats to France. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales joined the Prime Minister in a special service at Glasgow Cathedral where both men laid wreaths and paid tribute to the men and women who died. Later, the Duchess of Cornwall is expected at a service of remembrance at Westminster Abbey, while the Duke of York will be at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast.

"By . Tony Rennell . The unassuming man who, over the years, drove hundreds of children in the school buses of south Nottinghamshire was a war hero - not that any of them knew that. Alec Gilbert was not the sort of man to boast. His generation didn’t. They had seen and done much but they kept quiet about it, even with their own families. So it was only after he died that, among his personal effects, Mr Gilbert’s sons found proof of his outstanding bravery in northern France in June 1940. The Dunkirk beaches had been evacuated in the spectacular small-boat rescue of the British Army much hailed by Winston Churchill, but many thousands of soldiers who had not made it to the beaches remained in France, trying to hold off the rapidly advancing Germans until they could find another way home. War-time duty: Horace Stokes, left, is pictured aged 18 with colleagues just after joining the artillery. He too stayed tight-lipped about his wartime exploits . Corporal Gilbert of the Signals Corp was one of those men. With bombs from German planes and shells from enemy artillery exploding all around him, he drove a lorry to pick up fuel for five stranded British tanks. It was a mission impossible, on roads crowded with refugees and riddled with craters, but, grimly sticking to his task, he made it - an act of ‘outstanding courage, initiative and devotion to duty’, according to the citation for bravery which was unearthed on his death. Alec Gilbert was one of millions of ordinary, unsung British soldiers, sailors and airmen who fought their war between 1939 and 1945 with all the courage they could muster and then came home and got on with their lives, somehow burying the horrors they had experienced and quietly moving on. I know about him because his niece wrote to tell me after she had read an article about another soldier fighting in that same rearguard action in France: Major James Grant, the grandfather of actor Hugh Grant. It was a letter like scores I have received from families in response to my writings about World War II. ‘Dad’ was in bombers, on an Arctic convoy, at Alamein, D-Day, Arnhem and so on, these missives would tell me, but he would never talk about it. ‘And now he’s dead I will never know’ is often the haunting refrain of those who realise one of the mainstays of their life kept a huge secret from them that it is now too late to unearth. Derring-do: Mr Stoke, right, is pictured in 1941, when he was a Lance Corporal in the SAS . Peter Stokes does know what his father, Horace, was doing 70 years ago - but when he found out, it was a huge shock. As this paper reported yesterday, he discovered only on his father’s deathbed that the genial greengrocer and later cheery pub landlord had been a pioneering member of the elite, daredevil SAS. He parachuted into Nazi territory on secret sabotage missions and escaped from two POW camps. His extraordinary exploits were detailed in a journal he handed to his son shortly before he died in 1986, which is now being published. ‘I was filled with pride when I read it,’ says Mr Stokes. A military man himself, with distinguished service in the RAF, he was nonetheless ‘awestruck’ by the deeds his father described. Rising through the ranks: In this picture Mr Stoke, right, is a sergeant in the SAS. He would have killed many people as part of his service, and seen his own comrades die . ‘He was involved in some of the most famous raids during the World War II, and yet he’d never mentioned a word of it. 'At the end of the war, he closed the door on what he had done. He had killed many, many people and had seen his best friends killed. ‘But I know there was not a night that passed when he did not sit and reflect on what he had done.’ Secrecy was (and still is) emblematic of the SAS, and that may have been why Stokes Senior waited so long to unburden himself. For many others, however, their reluctance to talk about the war was because they felt they had wasted their youth in uniform and simply wanted to forget it. As one veteran told me: ‘When I got home, I didn’t say much about what had happened to me. I didn’t want to burden anyone. All I wanted to do was go out and have fun again.’ He promptly met the girl who would become his wife. ‘We hit it off really well and were married three months later. I didn’t want to tell her about it. It was behind me. We had a new life of our own to lead.’ For many others, their years of silence were because they could not bear to let their minds go back to horrors they had experienced or because they simply thought no one would be interested. In 1945, when the war ended, there was little appetite to hear someone else’s sob story or even their tale of courage and derring-do. Those who had fought overseas came home to a country that was rationed, blitzed and on its knees economically. Pretty soon the struggle to survive the peace outweighed the nostalgic re-living of the glories of the war. Heroes were two a penny, and treated as even less. Take RAF Sergeant Jimmy ‘Dixie’ Deans, a man of exceptional courage and integrity. As the leader of thousands of British inmates of a prisoner of war (POW) camp in remote eastern Germany, he had the commanding presence to shepherd his men on the notorious 500-mile Long March to the west, forced on them by their German captors who were fleeing advancing Russian troops. Record: Horace Stokes left this detailed journal to his son when he was about to die . He somehow found enough food to sustain them in a barren land and, through guts and guile, negotiated them safely past trigger-happy SS troops. When the column was accidentally strafed by our own side and 60 men were shot to pieces, he cycled and bluffed his way through the German front line, then over no man’s land to the advancing British lines to warn them to be more careful. And then, because he had given his word to the Germans who still held his men, he went back the way he had come, back into captivity. Fellow prisoners were in awe of Deans’s daring, but after the war the RAF scandalously had no use for him. He ended up as an anonymous civilian pen-pusher, afflicted by multiple sclerosis, forgotten by everyone except the hundreds of ex-POWs who turned up for his funeral in 1989. Men who had been POWs in the war often kept quiet about their experiences, ashamed - for no good reason - about having been captured. In northern France, Private Jock Graham - unlike Alec Gilbert, who escaped via Cherbourg - surrendered to the Germans at gunpoint, but only after two weeks on the run. As a POW, ‘Dad’s humour and optimism kept him going through forced marches and work in Polish mines’, according to his daughter, Janette. Filled with pride: Peter Stokes, himself a military man, was 'awestruck' to read of his father's actions . For decades, he suppressed memories of the awful times he’d had - the crippling work, hunger, brutality - but they surfaced in the end in the saddest of ways, relived horrifically in the dementia of his old age. As well as the POWs, airmen who had fought in Bomber Command also tended to keep quiet about what they had done, embarrassed by the unwarranted vitriol poured on them for the war they waged on German cities and civilians. But to have sat cramped inside the narrow and freezing fuselage of a Lancaster for hours on end, bucketed by winds and then battered by flak, shell-shot and shrapnel, was a test of endurance and courage, whatever the merits and morality of the mission you were sent on. The rear gunner was uniquely exposed, staring out into nothingness, just a thin layer of Perspex between him and 20,000ft of thin air, the original man in a glasshouse waiting for stones to be thrown at him. There were so many ways to die - a bullet in the face, sucked out if the casing shattered, burnt alive if the plane caught fire, drowned if you crashed into the sea, crushed if you fell on land. Secure: Many of those who served in the war kept their experiences hidden, either in a diary like this, which belonged to Mr Stokes, or in their own memories, to be lost forever . And the men who fought in aircraft knew that intimately. They watched planes alongside them in the formation - with mates on board - flame, droop and plunge to destruction. They could only pray, as they all did, they wouldn’t be next. If you were hit, you knew the chances of survival were small. The death rate for Bomber Command crew was a chilling 50 per cent. And yet they went out night after night, fearing the worst, suppressing the fear. Such men kept their thoughts to themselves. They did not ‘tweet’ their feelings to all and sundry - despite their emotions and experiences being of a profundity that shames the trivia of so much of today’s instant communication. They did not shout the odds about what they had done because tomorrow they might well be dead - as their best friend probably already was - or at best maimed and scarred for life. And after it was all over, they kept quiet because they were just thankful to be alive. ‘When I look back,’ one veteran airman told me, ‘I remember saying that if I ever got through the war alive, I would enjoy every day of my life. I’ve done a pretty good job of that. ‘I never thought of myself as a hero. A survivor, yes, not a hero. And lucky, damn lucky.’ This was a generation that went to the edge and looked over.  Those who came back were humbled by the experience - and, in this vainglorious, look-at-me  21st-century society of ours, that demands respect. Respect for their courage but also respect for their humility.","Hundreds of tales of bravery from the Second World War which have gone untold - because the generation that fought were not the sort to boast .

"By . Ruth Styles . It was a family day out for Zara Phillips today as she joined her mother Princess Anne and father Mark Phillips at an equestrian event. But she didn't have to travel far, for the Festival of British Eventing is held at the Princess Royal's Gatcombe Park estate - where Zara also lives. As a result, all three looked relaxed and happy, with Captain Phillips throwing a protective arm around his daughter, while Princess Anne cracked a joke before rubbing her nose. Scroll down for videos . Giggles: Captain Phillips extends a protective arm towards his daughter as Princess Anne tweaks her nose . Looking good: Zara opted for a simple white shirt and a pair of indigo skinny jeans for the event . Zara, who was pretty in indigo skinny jeans, a cream shirt and a pair of tan loafers, is currently in training for the World Equestrian Games in Normandy later this month but took a break to spend time with her parents and sister-in-law Autumn Phillips. She also allowed herself a rare day off yesterday, when she joined racing fans for Ladies Day at Glorious Goodwood yesterday. There, she joined Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March and Kinrara and his wife, Janet, in their box, where she was later seen chatting animatedly to unlikely racing fan, Tom Cruise. Although an unexpected guest, the actor, 52, appeared to quickly get the hang of racing and looked positively delighted when he was serenaded with the Mission Impossible theme tune by the Band of the Yorkshire Regiment. Out and about: Zara's sister-in-law Autumn Phillips was also at the event in a pretty sea-green top . Close family: Princess Anne, Captain Phillips and Zara burst into laughter as they enjoy their day out . Horse loving family: All three have or have had successful eventing careers - including Olympic medals . Today's outing was an altogether more low-key affair but offered her the rare chance to spend time with both parents, particularly as Captain Phillips, who is currently Chef d'Equipe for the US eventing team, is spending a considerable amount of time on the other side of the Atlantic. His time there hasn't been without scandal, however, after he left his second wife Sandy for an American showjumper 30 years his junior. Captain Phillips' relationship with Lauren Hough, 37, is still thought to be going strong two years after it was revealed, and appears to have had little impact on his career. Like his first wife Princess Anne and daughter Zara, he has enjoyed enormous success in the world of equestrianism, beginning with his gold medal winning appearance at the Munich Olympics in 1972. Day out: Zara shares a joke with Tom Cruise during a day out at the Glorious Goodwood race meeting yesterday . Day off: Zara, who wore a pretty Ted Baker dress, has taken a couple of days out from training . As well as Olympics success, Captain Phillips won the Badminton Horse Trials in 1971 and 1972 riding Great Ovation, in 1974 on Colombus, and in 1981 on Lincoln. After he retired from the Army, he continued to style himself Captain Mark Phillips - which was allowed as junior cavalry officers whose civilian work involves equestrianism may continue to use their rank. While Zara is yet to win Olympic gold, she will be hoping for a good performance in Normandy later this month, with Team GB selectors for Rio 2012 expected to be in the crowd. She will, at least, have the support of her London 2012 teammates William Fox-Pitt, Tina Cook, Nicola Wilson and Mary King, who are also expected to compete in France. Not so good: Tom looked less than impressed when his horse failed to come up with the goods . Exciting stuff: The unexpected appearance of Tom Cruise left the usually calm racegoers in a tizzy .","Zara, 33, was at the Festival of British Eventing at Gatcombe Park .

"By . Michael Zennie . A 19-year-old New Hampshire college student has died and two others were hospitalized after apparently overdosing on the club drug ecstasy during at a concert at the House of Blues in Boston, police say. Brittany Flannigan, a student at Plymouth State University, was rushed to the hospital after a show by German DJ Zedd ended about 12.30am Wednesday. A man and a woman, both in their 20s, were also taken to the hospital, but survived. Miss Flannigan died shortly after arriving at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital. Tragic: Police say Brittany Flannigan, a New Hampshire college student, died from an apparent overdose of the party drug Molly early Wednesday . Brittany's sister said Tuesday night's DJ Zedd concert was the first she had ever been to. She was a sosphomore at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire . The three overdoses happened at the House of Blues in Boston during a sold-out show for the popular DJ Zedd. He canceled his second show, scheduled for Wednesday night . Police told WBZ-TV that all three appear to have overdosed on Molly - a potent powder form of the party drug MDMA aka ecstasy. Miss Flannigan's sister said the DJ Zedd show was the first concert she had ever attended. The DJ, who was kicking off the world tour for his new album with a sold-out show, tweeted his sympathies after learning of the death of one of his fans. 'Love and respect to those in pain right now. Our hearts go out to you,' he said. 'PLEASE, everyone... BE RESPONSIBLE!' Wednesday's Zedd show at the the House of Blues was canceled while police wrapped up their investigation there. Miss Flannigan, from Derry, New Hampshire, was a sophomore at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire. Miss Flannigan's friends described her as being from a 'good family' Zedd, the German house music performer, tweeted out his sadness for the fans who overdosed and warned: 'Please, everyone: Be responsible!' The House of Blues has been cited in the past for not preventing drug use both inside and outside the venue . Molly is a party drug that is growing rapidly in popularity - usually by fans at music festivals or electronica or house music concerts. Molly is a powdered form of MDMA - or ecstasy - that is often much more pure and potent than the pill form of the drug. It can be mixed with amphetamines or caffeine and is usually snorted or rubbed on the gums. Effects can last three to six hours and can include enhanced feelings of emotional closeness and empathy. The drug can also cause deadly side-effects and results in thousands of hospitalizations a year. MDMA can interfere with the users ability to regulate body temperature. In severe cases, this can cause liver and kidney failure and even heart attack and stroke. The drug has a significant comedown, which can produce feelings of depression as well as aches and pains for hours. Scientific research has produced mixed results as to whether the drug is addictive, though some  users have reported that they became dependent on it. 'She was good, her parents were good people,' her friend Adam Cole told WBZ-TV. The Boston Herald reports that an ER nurse that she found two pink pills the jeans pocket of the 24-year-old woman who was taken to the hospital. Doctors also found a baggie of white powder in her bra. The man, who was described as being in his 20s, was said to be violently struggling with hospital staff. Both of the surviving overdose victims are listed in stable condition. Police say none of the partiers who overdosed knew each other. MDMA is popular at raves, music festivals and concerts for its reputed ability to make those who consume it feel euphoric and closer to the crowd and the musicians. However, it can also have dangerous affects, including respiratory distress, heart failure and even stroke. Live Nation, the concert promoter that owns House of Blues, issued a statement saying that 'safety is a top priory' for the company. 'One individual has unfortunately passed away and our thoughts go out to their family and friends for their loss. This matter is under investigation and we are continuing to working with local officials,' the statement read. This is not the first time the House of Blues in Boston has had problems with its patrons using drugs at concerts, the Boston Globe reports. In January 2010, the city Licensing Board cited the venue for not supervising fans standing in line outside who were inhaling nitrous oxide, another party drug, from balloons. In April 2010, the venue was shut down for a day after inspectors found beer kegs blocking exits and performers smoking marijuana in the green room before going onstage. The 23-year-old DJ Zedd, who performs electronic house music, was opening the world tour on his new album on Tuesday night .","Brittany Flannigan died after apparently overdosing on Molly at a concert at the House of Blues in Boston .

"By . Ruth Styles . From the blonde locks and bulging muscles of South Africa's Chad Le Clos to handsome homegrown talent Matthew Jamieson, there's no shortage of good-looking chaps to choose from among the swimming fraternity. But swimmers aren't the only ones currently brightening up the Commonwealth Games. Judo, rugby, hockey and athletics all boast a preponderance of attractive stars, among them Jamaica's Usain Bolt and Australia's Ed Jenkins. Other competitors making waves for their looks as well as their sporting prowess include England's Greg Rutherford and Ashley McKenzie and Kenya's Biko Wolfgang Adema. Still not convinced? FEMAIL rounds up the handsome athletes worth switching on for: . Looking good: Along with a role on Celebrity Big Brother in September 2012, handsome Ashley McKenzie boasts a stellar judo career - and just took gold for England . MICHAEL JAMIESON, SCOTLAND, SWIMMING . 25-year-old Jamieson, from Glasgow, might have missed out on a gold medal during last night's 200m breaststroke final but he did at least manage a well-earned silver to add to his already impressive medal collection. And its not just his prowess in the pool that has made the Olympic and Commonwealth silver medallist so popular: With his dark hair and honed torso, the swimmer, who is currently based in Bath, has proved a hit with the ladies as well. ASHLEY MCKENZIE, ENGLAND, JUDO . The newly crowned Commonwealth judo champion, Ashley McKenzie is arguably the best known member of Team GB's judo stars - thanks, in part, to a stint on Celebrity Big Brother, where he managed a respectable fifth place. When not starring in reality TV shows, the 25-year-old athlete has been making waves in the world of judo and is currently number one in Europe, although unfortunately, he failed to make it past the second round during the London 2012 Olympics. His Commonwealth Games win (and extremely good looks) suggest he's one to watch. Handsome: Commonwealth silver medal winning swimmer Michael Jamieson of Scotland (left) and England's gold medal winning judo champion Ashley McKenzie . BIKO WOLFGANG ADEMA, KENYA, RUGBY SEVENS . Strapping . Biko Wolfgang Adema, 26, is one of Kenya's hottest rugby stars and has . been playing the game since being introduced to it by his older brother . at primary school. Although . Kenya isn't a medal favourite, Adema, who says his motto is 'never give . up' has other ideas and hopes to fly home to Nairobi with a medal. Tune . in tomorrow for his first outing at Glasgow 2014 - in a group match . against the Cook Islands. USAIN BOLT, JAMAICA, ATHLETICS . The world's fastest man hardly needs introducing, having swept all before him - both on and off the track - since exploding onto the scene during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Since then, he's gone on to win just about every race he's entered and the hearts of women worldwide - most notably those of the Swedish handball team during London 2012. Although Bolt is rumoured to have begun dating a fellow Jamaican, the sprinter has remained uncharacteristically quiet about his alleged new relationship, begun following a split from his British former girlfriend Megan Edwards in December 2013. Narrow miss: Jamieson was narrowly beaten into second place during last night's 200m breaststroke by compatriot Ross Murdoch, 20 . Hunky: Biko Wolfgang Adema hopes he and his teammates will triumph in the rugby sevens at Glasgow 2014. Kenya's first match is against the Cook Islands tomorrow . Legend: .

One of the youngest competitors at Glasgow 2014, New Zealand's Corey Main, 19, is also one of the best looking. The New Zealand swimmer is among the young talent tipped for the top at this year's Games, in his case in the 100m backstroke. The Aucklander will face some stiff competition in order to triumph however, with defending champion, England's Liam Tancock, and Australia's Mitchell Larkin among those to beat. ED JENKINS, AUSTRALIA, RUGBY SEVENS . At 6ft 2"" tall and weighing in at nearly 15st, handsome rugby sevens star Ed Jenkins, 28, is a formidable opponent for any team taking on the Wallabies - as is his identical twin brother, Super Rugby star Jono Jenkins. Currently the vice-captain of Australia's sevens side, Jenkins (and his compatriots) are convinced that this could be the year that the team take home a Commonwealth gold. They will, however, have to get past the equally impressive England and New Zealand to do it. Double trouble: Woburn Sands' star Greg Rutherford is expecting a baby with his girlfriend while Australia sevens star Ed Jenkins has an identical twin brother . Yellow peril: Ed is the Wallabies vice captain and has high hopes of taking home a Commonwealth gold - if he and his men can beat favourites, England and New Zealand . GREG RUTHERFORD, ENGLAND, ATHLETICS . The . man from Woburn Sands is only the second British long jumper to take . Olympic gold - and boasts fiery good looks that are almost as impressive . as his sporting achievements. Sadly . for those with lingering hopes of impressing the England and GB . athlete, Rutherford, 27, announced in April that he and his girlfriend . Susie Verrill are expecting their first child together. CHAD LE CLOS, SOUTH AFRICA, SWIMMING . The man with the most famous sporting dad on the planet, South Africa's Chad le Clos, 22, shot to fame during the London 2012 Olympics when he unexpectedly beat US swimmer Michael Phelps to take gold in the 200m butterfly. Father Bert's ecstatic reaction - and hilarious follow-up interview with Clare Balding - made stars of both father and son, although Chad's blonde good looks certainly helped to get the ladies on side.

SEAN LAMONT, SCOTLAND, RUGBY SEVENS . One of Scotland's most accomplished rugby stars, 33-year-old Sean Lamont is among those taking to the field for the home team - much to the delight of local ladies enchanted with his dark good looks. When he's not running out for the rugby sevens squad, the man from Perth spends his time playing rugby union, currently for local side the Glasgow Warriors following stints at Rotherham and the Northampton Saints/ . LOUIS SMITH, ENGLAND, GYMNASTICS . The Olympic bronze medallist and Strictly Come Dancing winner barely requires an introduction. But things haven't been easy for Smith, 25, since the giddy heights of 2012 with the gymnast spending much of 2013 battling depression. Making his competitive comeback following an enforced career break, the man from Peterborough hopes to make a splash when he takes to the floor - despite having only gone back into training in January.

"By . Ruth Styles . Prince Harry gave a rare radio interview this morning in a bid to raise the profile of September's Invictus Games. But in true Prince Philip style, he couldn't resist a cheeky quip, telling DJ Chris Evans that 'you look like you've been to a few' when the veteran host mentioned music festivals. The prince, who did the interview alongside former Royal Marines JJ Chalmers and Luke Darlington, went on to reveal that the Invictus Games could become an annual event. Royal radio: Harry with marines Luke Darlington (left) and JJ Chalmers (right) in the Radio 2 studio . All smiles: The three soldiers smile as they chat to DJ Chris Evans about September's Invictus Games . 'This is definitely going to be a regular . event,' he insisted. 'We’re still trying to work out whether we do it next year or the . year after and whether it’s going to be within the UK or whether it’s . going to be abroad. 'But the legacy has already started and if we can use . it as a stepping stone for some of these individuals to move onto the . Paralympics, great. 'If some of them want to use it as a one-off to get . themselves back on the road and then as a stepping stone to employment, . then just as good. We will use the Invictus Games for as long as it’s . needed.' Harry, who also told Evans that, contrary to rumours, he remains a serving army officer, has been planning the Invictus Games for more than a year. Festivals: Harry quipped that Evans looked like he'd been to a few during the radio interview . Chip off the old block: Prince Philip and Prince Harry, both military men, are famous for their cheeky quips . Inspired by the American Warrior Games which sees injured servicemen from the Navy, Airforce and Army do battle on the sports field, Harry said his aim was to make the British version 'bigger and better' than the original. 'The Americans have had . the Warrior Games now for the last four and a half, five years,' he told Evans. 'They . have the Navy against the RAF against the Army. 'We went over there - I . had a team of 30 UK guys that joined in with the Americans and . basically saw this event take place - and decided that it was such a . wonderful concept we should steal it, make it bigger, make it better and . bring it back home.' The resulting games will take place between the 10th and 14th September and will see 400 competitors from 14 countries compete at Olympic venues in London. Tickets for the Invictus Games go on sale tomorrow and Harry said that he hopes to see every seat in the venues, which include the Copper Box, filled up. Overwhelmed: On his way into the studio, Prince Harry stopped to have his photo taken with a little girl . Thrilled: The young fan looked thrilled as kind-hearted Harry crouched down for a photo . Passion project: Prince Harry was at the studio to promote the Invictus Games which open in September . 'We’ve got 55 000 tickets in total,' said the prince. 'We’ve . sold a lot and, you know, we want to sell more. 'My main effort right . from the beginning of this whole story was to ensure that we provide the . best opportunities and the best atmosphere for these venues, and the . Copper Box has, I think, 6,000 seats in it. I want every single one filled . so come and help fill it.' He also the Invictus Games rock concert and hinted that there might be more big names to add to a line-up that already includes the Foo Fighters and the Kaiser Chiefs. 'The concert, which everyone . knows about, is being headlined by the Foo Fighters. We’ve got Ellie . Goulding, James Blunt and numerous other people some of which I’m not . allowed to mention. 'So the concert itself will be fantastic and, as I . said earlier, a real chance to come and celebrate and cheer on these . guys as they’re going to be a part of the concert.' The Invictus Games will also have opening and closing ceremonies - both of which will be attended by Harry himself, who added, as he left the studio: 'Be there!' On the radio: Harry with marines Luke Darlington (left) and JJ Chalmers (right) at the BBC studio . While much of the attention was on Prince Harry this morning, the marines who accompanied him into the BBC studio have fascinating stories of their own. Royal Marines JJ Chalmers and Luke Darlington were both injured while serving in Afghanistan with 42 Commando and hope to take part in the Invictus Games. 'I think the Invictus Games . is going to be incredible for a few reasons,' says Chalmers, who suffered severe injuries to his arms and legs after an IED exploded nearby. 'Once upon a time I woke up in a hospital bed absolutely broken . thinking I’ll never do this again. I’ve got to the point where I realise . that I can do a lot of things, but not only do them, but I can compete . in them. 'I just want to keep pushing the boundaries of what I’m capable . of doing, and competition is one way of doing it.' Fellow marine Luke Darlington suffered a penetrating brain Injury, which left him in a coma for four weeks, a partial right side paralysis and 25 per cent less brain capacity. 'I don’t have any regrets,' he says. 'I went through a phase in my life when I thought I couldn’t go on and live like this. 'But then I realised it didn’t make me feel any better, so I stopped. I want to take part in the Invictus Games because the opportunity to represent the UK would be a brilliant feeling. 'Sport, especially cycling, has helped me enormously. Probably even more psychologically than physically. It’s enabled me to believe in myself again.' Motivation: Prince Harry, seen here with a serviceman at Tedworth House, hopes to repeat the event . Important: The Games will also feature soldiers from Afghanistan and Denmark among other nations .","Harry made the joke during an appearance on Radio 2 this morning .

"By . Sarah Dean . and Candace Sutton . and Sarah Michael . Murdered Sydney student Jamie Gao was reportedly in 'secret talks with police' in the weeks before he was killed. The 20-year-old had allegedly been called to give evidence before the Australian Crime Commission, the country's peak intelligence-gathering agency. When asked why Mr Gao was recently questioned by ACC investigators at its Sydney headquarters, the commission said it had 'nothing to add', The Daily Telegraph claims. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Jamie Gao 'was in secret talks with police' before his death, according to the latest reports . Federal police have publicly denied claims that Mr Gao, who is thought to have been caught up in a Hong Kong-based Asian organised crime group, was acting as an informant when he delivered $3 million of methamphetamine to former detectives Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara. Mr Gao had reportedly told his close friends about the hearing but the commission has denied these claims. On Saturday, it was revealed federal police were watching over murdered student Jamie Gao for a staggering three years before his death. Friends' claims that he was just a social and naturally smart pupil have been shattered by revelations that he has long been a suspected drug importer. Suggesting that he was far from simply a straight-A student at the University of Technology Sydney, federal officers have provided a 20-page document about his dealings to NSW authorities, who say Mr Gao had been a 'person of interest' since as far back as 2011. Police say that on the day of his murder Mr Gao was carrying the 3kg worth of methamphetamine. Watched: Federal police were reportedly monitoring Jamie Gao for three years before his death . 'He was not some lowly delivery boy,' one senior detective told The Daily Telegraph. 'No syndicate is going to trust some underling with 3kg of gear and you don't get trusted with that much for your first deal.' It is believed Mr Gao was caught up in organised crime group, at the same time as living an active social life and being loved-up with his new girlfriend. He still lived at home with his mother Catherin Sui Ying Gao and grandmother in a $1.5 million house in Hurstville. Police have alleged that before he was killed on Tuesday May 20, he got inside a car with  former detectives Glen McNamara and Roger Rogerson and was driven to a storage unit nearby. Police claim Mr Gao was killed for his bag's contents just before 2.30pm. CCTV footage showed Mr Gao last getting out of his car holding a large bag in Padstow. Friends of the murdered 20-year-old say 'his intention was not to be bad' and he was swayed by peer pressure . Earlier this week, MailOnline revealed details of an incident in January where Mr Gao abducted and bashed a teenager  on behalf of a scorned friend in a terrifying 90-minute ordeal. Jaiwei Yu, 19, said he was kidnapped, taken to a park and bashed in the head and chest by Mr Gao and two accomplices. Mr Gao had been called in as an enforcer to 'get revenge' on 18-year-old Alex Li on behalf of a female friend, who had been dumped by the victim's flatmate, the intended target of the assault. But when Mr Gao arrived at the flat at Carlton in Sydney's south on January 9, Mr Li was not at home – so he abducted Mr Yu instead. Abducted:  The flat (left) at Carlton in Sydney's south that Jaiwei Yu (right) was kidnapped from by Jamie Gao . Detained after dark: It was to this park, Tindale Reserve, in southern Sydney where Jamie Gao and two teenage accomplices took 19-year-old Jiawei Yu after kidnapping and beating him and driving him around in his car on the night of Thursday January 9 as part of a revenge attempt gone wrong . 'It was because Alex and his girlfriend' broke up,' Mr Yu told MailOnline at his home in Sydney's southern suburbs. '[She] wanted revenge on Alex. She used Jamie to do it ... to come around and kidnap me.' During the terrifying 90-minute ordeal Mr Yu was driven around nearby suburbs, taken to Tindale Reserve, a local park, and bashed around the head and chest by Mr Gao, who he had never previously met. 'They drove around, through the park and they beat him up with fists in the head,' Mr Li said. Meanwhile Mr Li, the intended target, was staying at a house just one street away when Mr Gao arrived sometime after 10pm. Jamie Gao's girlfriend (pictured kissing him) is in shock over his death . 'They think I am with Jaiwei. We are friends,' Mr Li said. 'They thought I would be at his house. I'm not at home and they thought he might be here.' Police interviewed Mr Yu at his home in February and on March 22 charged Mr Gao with taking and detaining Mr Yu in company with intent to get advantage and occasioning actual bodily harm. Mr Gao was also charged with conspiring with the two teenagers to assault Alex Li and cause him actual bodily harm. The girl and the third friend, who were minors at the time, will face Sutherland Children's Court on July 1 on charges relating to the kidnap and assault. Meanwhile, a 19-year-old friend of Mr Gao's, who had lunch with him the day before he was murdered, told MailOnline his involvement in a drug deal seemed completely out of character, describing him as a 'nice guy' who was swayed by peer pressure. 'People say he's dealing drugs and he's bad. But his intention is not to be bad,' she said. 'He doesn't do anything on purpose to hurt anyone, I think he was just persuaded by his friends and by peer pressure.' 'He doesn't tell us about all the stuff he does,' she said. 'He does tell us about his private life, family and girlfriend but not about the illegal stuff.' Mr Gao (left) and his girlfriend (right) started dating at the beginning of the year . The day before his murder was reportedly as normal for Mr Gao as any other. He went to his morning university classes before stopping for lunch at a nearby cafe with a uni friend. At no stage, his friend told MailOnline, did he seem nervous or on edge. Nor did he mention his plans for the following day. Instead he spent his time gushing about his new girlfriend - a young woman he'd had a crush on for some time and had been dating for just 'a couple of months'. Pictures posted to Mr Gao's girlfriend's Facebook page show the couple hugging and kissing. Mr Gao's girlfriend told MailOnline she was struggling to cope with the news. She declined to comment in detail, saying it was a 'very hard time' for her. On Monday May 19, the UTS business student went to class in the morning and afternoon as normal. During a break between 11am and 1pm he lunched with a friend at Caffe Tiamo on Pitt St in Sydney's CBD. Mr Gao's girlfriend told the MailOnline it was a 'very hard time' for her . His female friend, who did not want to be named, said Mr Gao did not talk about his plans for the next day. 'He was fine, normal. we had lunch,' she said. 'He didn't tell me about the meeting.' Mr Gao's friend told MailOnline that, before the body was formally identified, his girlfriend was still hopeful he'd return, saying she 'still expects him to come back'. 'They've only officially been together a couple of months, but he liked her for a while,' she said. The friend described Mr Gao as social and naturally smart. 'He wasn't crazy about study, he wasn't the nerdy type that studies every day, he was more social,' she said. Mr Gao's body was found floating off Sydney's Shelly Beach, near Cronulla, wrapped in a blue tarp on Monday morning. The discovery triggered a nation-wide manhunt for Rogerson, which ended in his arrest in a blaze of publicity at his Sydney home. McNamara, a former police colleague of Rogerson's, was charged with Mr Gao's murder on Sunday night. A body found floating off Shelly Beach near Cronulla was formally identified as Mr Gao on Tuesday afternoon .

"By . Ruth Styles . Do you dream of a wedding that comes complete with bulldog best men, an expensively customised horse drawn carriage and a romantic full moon - even when the real one is on the wane? Enter Don Antonio Polese, a man famous in his native Italy for throwing the most lavish weddings in a country, and who has provided everything from ship cakes to champagne swimming pools for his well-heeled brides and grooms. But despite the outrageous demands, bevvies of bridezillas and exhaustingly long days, Don Antonio says he still loves weddings - and is just as much of a romantic as ever. Main man: Don Antonio Polese is the man behind some of Italy's most extravagant weddings . 'Our work is nice because we are . involved in one of the happiest days of people's lives,' beams the larger-than-life Don Antonio. 'One groom said to . me once: ""I want to live the fairy tale, I want to live my story"" and we . do live their stories. This is a beautiful thing, no? Don Antonio, who owns the luxury La Sonrisa hotel in Naples, is now bringing his blingy brand of wedding to British TV screens courtesy of fly-on-the-wall series, My Crazy Italian Wedding, which is currently showing on TLC. In it, Don Antonio shows off his formidable powers of persuasion, grasp of small details and a touching willingness to go to ridiculous lengths when it comes to keeping his brides happy. 'We were doing a ceremony by the pool and there was no . moon that night but he bride said she wanted one,' remembers a chuckling Don Antonio. Happy couple: Newlyweds enjoy their first official kiss as they release a box of doves supplied by Don Antonio . Bizarre: Unusual requests have included a champagne swimming pool and a bulldog best man (pictured) In charge: Don Antonio, or 'The Boss' as he's known, with his right hand men outside La Sonrisa . 'So we had to provide the bride and groom with a moon, which we did by contacting a hot air balloon company and hiring a balloon, which we then used to light up the pool. 'We put it between the Sonrisa's two towers and roped it in place. The bride and groom were very pleased.' Bizarre though it might sound, a balloon moon is by no means the only unusual request, with cakes shaped like ships, swimming pools filled with champagne and bulldog best men all among past demands satisfied by Don Antonio. 'We always try to please everyone,' he adds. 'We've had a lot of strange requests but we never say no to anything.' Quirky: A bride arrives for her wedding in a personalised carriage to be welcomed by a ballerina . Imposing: Don Antonio outside his lavish Naples hotel and popular wedding venue, La Sonrisa . Lavish: Don Antonio keeps an eye on proceedings in La Sonrisa's extravagantly decorated ballroom . Not that that means Don Antonio won't diplomatically steer the bride and groom away from bad taste requests. 'I don't always go along with their ideas,' he smiles. 'I try to persuade them to have something a bit different if needed. 'We always try to, you know, make them see . our point of view.' He pauses and adds: 'I’m very good at convincing people I can handle such . situations.' Balloon moons notwithstanding, what most Italian brides and grooms want, says Don Antonio, is a personal affair - even if that means travelling huge distances and moving heaven and earth to get what they want. 'Once, a bride asked us to get a particular type of orchid called Cattleya, which can only be found in Thailand,' he remembers. 'We had to fly there just to pick up these Cattleya.' Other expensive requests focus on food. 'The . other day, one bride asked us to get in those Norwegian crabs, those big . crabs which we then had to cook according to a special recipe. 'In the end, we had to go to Florence to get them because our supplier didn't have any - they were flown in by plane from Norway.' Despite the crazy requests, Don Antonio says he still loves his job and describes himself as a 'romantic'. 'I love the party and the moments of joy,' he beams. 'We . get to be part of the most . beautiful moments of people's lives.' And what about British, American and Australian brides planning weddings this year? For them, Don Antonio has one simple piece of advice. 'Come and marry in Naples,' he chuckles, a cheeky smile lighting up his face. 'Come and celebrate at the Sonrisa. You will have the perfect wedding - I guarantee it.' My Crazy Italian Wedding, Wednesdays at 7.30pm on TLC .","Don Antonio Polese is the man behind some of Italy's wackiest weddings .

"By . Ruth Styles . With polo, scuba diving and fly fishing all on his sporting CV, Prince Charles certainly isn't one to shy away from a spot of vigorous exercise. And the sporty royal certainly met his match today in the shape of Jamaican boxer Cheavon Clarke who jokingly squared up to the Prince of Wales - much to his delight. Watched by a chuckling Duchess of Cornwall, the two indulged in a mock bout with Charles even pretending to throw a punch before shaking Clarke's hand instead. Scroll down for video . Entertaining: Prince Charles beams as he pretends to square up to Jamaican boxer Cheavon Clarke . Fight club: During the 'bout', he pretended to throw a punch before shaking Clarke's hand instead . The lighthearted moment had echoes of Prince Harry's visit to Jamaica in 2012, when the cheeky royal 'won' a race against sprinter Usain Bolt by haring off when the athlete's back was turned. But Clarke wasn't the only boxing star to make a big impression on the royal visitors: Prince Charles looked on in awe as members of the Indian women's team engaged in a practice bout, while the Duchess of Cornwall indulged in a friendly chat with the Kenyans. They also stopped to offer a few words of support to the Australian badminton team before posing for a group photo surrounded by green and gold. Afterwards, Charles and Camilla, who are known as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, continued their tour of the Emirates Arena in Glasgow with a visit to the Velodrome to meet Olympic star, Sir Chris Hoy. Warm: The mock bout evoked memories of Prince Harry's infamous 'win' at Usain Bolt's expense in Jamaica .

Amused: Camilla bursts into laughter as she sits with Scottish Ballet artistic director, Christopher Hampson . Members of the British cycling team, which won a record seven gold medals at the London 2012, later took to Twitter to tell of their royal encounter, with Canadian cyclist Ed Veal excitedly tweeting about the experience. 'Met Prince Charles & Camilla at the velodrome today,' he wrote. 'Walked right up as I was exiting the track,shook hands said hello. Looking for pics pls.'

"By . Ruth Styles . The Duchess of Cambridge proved one again that she's a high street princess as she swapped yesterday's Alexander McQueen for blue L.K Bennett for a visit to the Tower of London. Laughing with one of the Beefeater guards and with General the Lord Dannatt, Constable of the Tower as she arrived at the fortress, the Duchess looked stylishly sober in her blue dress and conservative navy suede court shoes. Like yesterday's cream Alexander McQueen, the blue colour of the dress was a nod towards the peace that was shattered 100 years ago yesterday. Scroll down for video . Moving: The Duchess brushed away a tear as she walked through the huge sea of poppies . Sombre: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge look solemn as they walk through the sea of ceramic poppies . Planting: The Duchess of Cambridge leans down to plant a poppy in the Tower of London installation . And the catastrophic effect on the people of Britain and the Commonwealth of the end of peace was made plain by the poppy field the Duchess, Prince William and Prince Harry had come to see. Brushing a tear from her eye as she toured the installation, the Duchess appeared deeply moved by the sight, as did Prince William and Prince Harry. Entitled Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red, the installation will eventually see 888,246 ceramic poppies planted in the moat - one for every soldier from the UK, Australia and the Commonwealth killed during the Great War. Sweeping down through a window and down into the moat, the first poppy in the installation was planted by a yeoman warder on the 17th July and the last will be put in place on the 11th November to coincide with Armistice Day.

Contemplative: The royal trio looked sombre as they walked through the poppy field in the Tower's moat . Tour: The Duke and Duchess and Prince Harry were given a tour by General the Lord Dannatt . The Tower, long a critical part of . London's defences, also had a role to play during the Great War, first . as a recruitment station and later as a prison. By the end of August 1914, more than 1,600 men had enlisted at the Tower, forming the 10th Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, the so called 'Stockbrokers Battalion', which fought on until the end of the war. It was also during World War One that the last executions at the Tower took place, with 11 German spies meeting their end courtesy of a firing squad stationed on Tower Green. Today, however, was all about the British men who went off to war and never came back, with Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge all planting poppies during their visit. Video courtesy of Royal Historic Palaces . Tribute: The ceramic poppy field will eventually include 888,246 poppies - one for each military death . All smiles: The Duchess of Cambridge shares a smile with General the Lord Dannatt, Constable of the Tower .

Greeting: The Duchess is greeted by a Yeoman Warder or Beefeater as she arrives at the Tower of London . Memorial: The royals almost disappear within the flowers - one for every British and Commonwealth death . The three, who last night represented the Queen at a service at St Symphorien cemetery in the Belgian town of Mons, were also given a tour of the installation and wandered through the massed poppies in silence. While the installation can do little other than jog memories for the men of the Stockbroker's Battalion, visitors to the poppy field will be asked to donate to one of six service charities. Among them are Combat Stress, which helps veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder,  Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion. Wartime: During the Great War, the Tower was used as a recruiting centre - and as a prison and execution site .

"By . Ruth Styles . With just over a month to go until she joins Team GB for the World Equestrian Games in Normandy, Zara Phillips appears to be pulling out all the stops to prove that motherhood hasn't blunted her competitive edge. Competing at the Dauntsey Park Horse Trials in Wiltshire, the 33-year-old Olympic silver medallist looked in tip top shape as she braved a difficult course in blazing sunshine. But it wasn't all hard work, for watching from the sidelines was the royal's six-month-old baby daughter Mia who was being looked after by a friend while her mother tackled the enormous jumps. Scroll down for video . Back in the saddle: Zara Phillips takes the reins as she competes at the Dauntsey Park Horse Trials in Wiltshire . Competitive: Zara is currently preparing for the World Equestrian Games which take place next month . Zara's riding career, put on hold during her pregnancy and for the first few months of Mia's life, is slowly cranking back into top gear as the World Equestrian Games approach. Earlier this month, Zara took to the field at the Barbury Horse Trials near Marlborough - with baby Mia once more among the crowds. Late June saw her enjoy a successful day at the Salperton Park Horse Trials in Gloucestershire, watched by husband Mike Tindall, 36, and another outing at the Hopetoun Horse Trials in Edinburgh. But successful though most of her outings have been, it is the World Equestrian Games that are at the forefront of her mind, particularly as Team GB selectors for Rio 2016 will be in the crowd. Day out: Little Mia Tindall was cared for by a friend of Zara's while she took to the course . Hot work: Zara's Olympic horse High Kingdom was also back in action and will compete in France next month . Competing alongside Zara in Normandy will be the rest of the current Team GB, among them world number one William Fox-Pitt and fellow Olympic medallist Tina Cook. The World Equestrian Games will also see the return of Zara's Olympic horse High Kingdom who, like his mistress, has been warming up with smaller British events at Dauntsey, Barbury and Salperton. Kicking off on the 23rd August, the Games include eight different disciplines, among them eventing, showjumping, dressage and endurance. The latter, as the name suggests, involves a 160km race that takes place over the course of a single day with the majority of participants plumping for hardy Arab horses.

"By . Ruth Styles . With less than a week to go until Prince George's first birthday, bookmakers have suspended betting on a royal pregnancy announcement this month after a flurry of bets were placed overnight. The bets, which were placed with bookmakers Coral, were made online and in quick succession - enough, said a spokesman for the betting firm, to set alarm bells ringing. Prior to the unusual activity, Coral had been offering odds of 10/1 on the Duchess of Cambridge announcing a second pregnancy in July but slashed the odds to even money before pulling the plug entirely. Scroll down for video . New baby: Coral has suspended betting on a royal pregnancy announcement after a string of bets . 'With Prince George’s first birthday . just around the corner, the latest gamble strongly indicates that he . could soon be joined by a little brother or sister,' commented Coral's Nicola McGeady. 'In fact, there could . even be double celebrations in the Windsor household next Tuesday.' Ladbrokes has also suspended betting on a July pregnancy announcement after slashing odds from 8/11 to 4/1 overnight. Kensington Palace, which has not confirmed any of the rumours or speculation, refused to comment when approached by MailOnline.

'within months'. 'Kate's inner circle are buzzing with the news that she is pregnant,' said Hay, according to the Australian magazine. 'I've heard it from several different friends of theirs now and they're saying that they think there's going to be an official announcement in weeks.' Hay, who attended Marlborough College with the Duchess, added, 'Kate's face is fuller like it was when she was first expecting George and she's been changing her hair, which could be to disguise the fullness. 'She has rosy cheeks, she's letting her greys show again, and whenever she's out in public she goes to great lengths to hold something over her tummy.' Bookmakers might have suspended betting on a possible pregnancy announcement this month but that hasn't stopped punters from placing bets on the name of Prince George's future brother or sister.

Also popular are Thomas on 10/1, Mary and Diana on 12/1 and Alice on 16/1. Charles, Charlotte, Frances and Phillip are also heavily backed.

The Conservative MP for Wirral West is one of a number of rising stars promoted to Cabinet positions in today's reshuffle - and one of the most glamorous. A former GMTV presenter, Ms McVey, 46, looks set to give home secretary Theresa May, herself a fashion fan, a run for her money in the style stakes. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: The newest member of the Cabinet Esther McVey MP strikes a pose as she leaves Downing Street . Looking good: Esther McVey MP is among the female MPs promoted to Cabinet in the latest reshuffle . Like the home secretary, Ms McVey is partial to a fabulous pair of shoes; picking a dove grey pair of suede wedges for her meeting with the prime minister. As a former TV presenter, McVey knows exactly how important image is, and will no doubt have picked out her outfit with care. While the minister for employment and disabilities has often spoken of her love for fashion, she boasts a CV that's just as impressive as her wardrobe. A former GMTV and children's TV presenter, Liverpudlian Ms McVey became Conservative MP for Wirral West in 2010 and has climbed rapidly through the ranks of the Tory party.

And Ms McVey certainly isn't alone. Joining her and the impressive Theresa May at the Cabinet table is Loughborough MP Nicky Morgan, the new education secretary, and South West Norfolk's Liz Truss MP who takes the environment brief. Like McVey and May, both women are sharp dressers who have brought businesslike wardrobes featuring neat pencil skirts and serious tailored jackets to their high-powered roles.

The received wisdom is that, as you get older, you should pay more for your denims to get clever cuts that disguise saggy or wobbly bits. But is this really true?

Scroll down for video . £90, levi.com . Nothing special, no wow factor.  The high waist failed to add any oomph and they looked too traditional and  felt a little outdated and basic.

"By . Ruth Styles . For Yonn Lazer, 36, from the tiny village of Argetoaia in southern Romania, life for him, his wife Maria and their three children hasn't always been easy. But the family's life has taken a turn for the better after Mr Lazer moved to London - allowing him to put a grand plan to rake in £40,000 in British benefits into action. Six months after arriving in the capital, Mr Lazer is sending home £800 each week - and says 'England' has 'given me everything'. Scroll down for video . Big plans: Yonn Lazer, 36, from Argetoaia in Romania, plans to make £40,000 from benefits in two years . 'I know it is very, very easy to take . benefit in England,' says the 36-year-old whose last trip to the UK, prior to the relaxing of restrictions on Romanian nationals, ended in his deportation for failing to find a job. 'She's give me home free. She's give me money free. She's give me everything.' The UK has become an increasingly popular destination for European Roma gypsies, with a staggering 200,000 arriving in the last decade alone. Reasons for the influx include ostracism at home and a lack of job opportunities, as well as the ease with which migrants can access benefits in the UK. The latter is something Mr Lazer knows all too well. 'England is one country with much money,' he says. 'I . need maybe £40,000 for my family and I think this money I can make in . one year, maybe two. 'I want to make one good house with three rooms, . one bathroom, a fridge, plasma TV...

Not happy: Mr Lazer says he needs to make money for the sake of his wife Maria and their three young children . If he doesn't manage to rake in enough cash, his plans will take a criminal turn. 'If I don't have food, I'll go and steal,' he admits. 'The pocket, the paper and sometimes in the house if there is . nobody, take, yeah.' Although his wife Maria has remained in Argetoaia with the couple's three children, joining Mr Lazer in London is his sister, her husband and their neighbours Dmitri and Stefana. Also in London is Mr Lazer's 15-year-old daughter Alina, recently married and pregnant with her first child. 'My daughter is coming here together with . her husband and she's going to stay here because is good country,' says Mr Lazer happily. 'We . gonna make some money quick and she's going to be everything OK. I . am very happy for this.' Like most Roma travelling to the UK, Mr Lazer's transport and accommodation were paid for by his clan leader, who takes a cut from any money he makes and any benefits he claims. Along with claiming as much as possible, including tax credits for his children in Romania, Mr Lazer has also been working for his clan boss as a scrap metal collector. Tough times: Mr Lazer (centre), his wife Maria (left) and his brother-in-law who has also travelled to the UK . Squalid: The grim conditions in which Mr Lazer's family live in their home village of Argetoaia in Romania . 'I'm going to take any metal from the . street because I need money,' says Mr Lazer. 'And if I see something, I'm going to the . home. I knock on the door and I'm ask if there is any . metal. If it's outside, from garden I take, no I don't ask, because it's . outside.' Nephew Romica, also living in the UK, takes a similar approach to scrap metal collecting. 'Bicycles are the easiest thing to take and the money from this is quite good,' he explains. 'I take 10 to15 bikes, we sell them and make money.' Lucrative though the scrap metal trade can be, the real money spinner is benefits and Mr Lazer says he is sending up to £800 a week home to his family. 'I think it's good money for me now, for . the moment,' he says cheerfully. 'I have children benefit, I have tax working . credit and I have child tax credit. £820 so it's good money for me. New job: Mr Lazer is topping up his benefits by collecting scrap metal - of both the legal and illegal varieties . 'This . week, Monday, I sent £500 and today, I'm going to send more £300. It's . £800 just this week. It's good money because I need for my family this . money because I know in Romania, life is heavy. If I don't have money, . don't have nothing.' Is he at all embarrassed about the amount he's being handed? The answer is no. 'Some people think it's bad if . you have benefit or something but I think it's not,' he says. 'I think it's very . good. It's good for me and my family. I don't have any . interest in what they think, other people. It's my life, my family and I . think I am lucky, yeah!'

"By . Ollie Gillman For Mailonline . Barack Obama's great-uncle, a Second World War veteran, has died aged 89 from non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Charles T. Payne, who helped liberate a Nazi concentration camp in World War II, died on August 1 in Chicago. Mr Payne was briefly in the pubic eye during the President's first election campaign when Obama mistakenly said his great-uncle had liberated Auschwitz. Barack Obama's great-uncle Charles Payne, pictured with his wife Melanie, has died aged 89 . Mr Payne played a role in liberating Ohrdruf, a section of the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany . When he was just 20, Mr Payne, had in fact helped free prisoners at Ohrdruf, a section of the Buchenwald concentration camp where an estimated 56,545 people were killed by the SS. It was Soviet forces who liberated Auschwitz in January 1945 as they marched across Nazi-occupied Poland. Mr Payne, who is the brother of Obama's maternal grandmother Madelyn Dunham, said at the time that he was 'truly astonished' by the attention paid to the gaffe, and called his nephew 'truly an astounding young man'. The veteran modestly played down his role in the liberation of Ohrdruf, but described the horrors he saw there, including a circle of dead inmates in rags that had clearly been near starvation when they were killed. He said: 'They were there with their tin cups like they were called to get food, then had been machine gunned. 'Nothing but just skin over bones with nothing, no flesh at all.' During his first election campaign, Obama mistakenly said that Mr Payne had helped free prisoners at Auschwitz, but quickly corrected himself . After the war, Mr Payne went to college in Kansas, where he had grown up. He went on to graduate at the University of Chicago, where Obama would later lecture on constitutional law. Uncle Charlie, as he was called by the President, became a pioneer in IT at the university, retiring aged 70 from his position as assistant director of the college's library. Melanie, his wife of 50 years, said her husband was 'very pleased and proud' to have served in two Presidential delegations in recent years to commemorate World War II anniversaries. He is also survived by a son, Richard.","Charles T. Payne freed prisoners at Ohrdruf, a section of the Buchenwald concentration camp where more than 56,000 died .

"By . Alex Finnis For Mail Online . Eric Silverman is breathing a sigh of relief after doctors told him they believe his Ebola scare is actually just malaria . The Brooklyn man who was quarantined in New York and suspected to have been infected with Ebola probably just has malaria. Humanitarian worker Eric Silverman, 27, had just returned from a four-month stint in Sierra Leone, where he was doing farming and building work, when he started developing symptoms similar to those shown by Ebola victims. When Mr Silverman initially tested negative for malaria he became terrified that he may have the killer disease, but now it turns out that he probably does have malaria after all. Mr Silverman returned to New York on July 17 for his mother's birthday, and developed severe stomach pains and high fever two weeks later. To go with the diarrhoea, sore throat and headaches, he was quarantined in Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital and had to deal with the fearful prospect that he may be the latest victim of the untreatable disease. He was kept in an isolated glass box for more than 72 hours, as Americans all over the country feared the disease had spread to their shores, but an infectious disease doctor has now told him that all the evidence suggests he has malaria - a disease he had already contracted back in February. 'I've been taking a lot of medicine, and so that kind of might have interfered, and so they couldn't spot any malaria in my blood work, but it could still be there,' Silverman told CBS New York. Scroll down for video . Mr Silverman (right), a 27-year-old Brooklyn grad student who returned from Sierra Leone in July, was  quarantined at Mount Sinai Medical Center after complaining of symptoms all too familiar to Ebola victims . Mr Silverman was known as 'Ebola Patient Zero' all over America, and he told the New York Daily News: 'Even my friends didn’t believe me when I told them I was the mystery patient. They thought I was joking.' Mr Silverman plans to return to Sierra Leone to continue his humanitarian work . He recounted how he first fell ill: 'I turned up the heat in the car to 90 degrees and drove back to Brooklyn — then I got out of the car and I was freezing again. 'My mother took my temperature and it was 104. When she called our family doctor, she said to get me to the emergency room at Mount Sinai.' Silverman's nurse, Margaret Kraus, compared the next 72 hours to the night the hospital went on overdrive to house extra patients forced to evacuate another hospital during Hurricane Sandy. 'If he had the Ebola virus, we all knew how it could impact so many people’s lives,' she said. Now that he has been given the all-clear, Mr Silverman plans to return to Sierra Leone to continue his humanitarian work once the Ebola outbreak has cleared up. The virus claimed its first European victim on Monday, when 75-year-old Spanish priest Miguel Pajares died five days after being airlifted from Liberia to Madrid for expert care. The overall death toll is now at 1,069 people, and with it continuing to rise with no signs of stopping, the World Health Organisation declared it ethical to use untested drugs to attempt to control it.","Eric Silverman, 27, was quarantined in a New York hotel for three days .

"By . Mark Duell . Mother-of-two: Jillian Hewson, was found drowned in the bath after collapsing with a heart condition . A teaching assistant was found by her son drowned in the bath after collapsing with a heart condition, an inquest heard yesterday. Mother-of-two Jillian Hewson, 38, was discovered at her £150,000 three-bedroom detached house in Royton, Greater Manchester. Her mother Linden Slater, 65, said: ‘We are all devastated by what has happened. She was very popular a beautiful mum, our sunshine girl. ‘It is such a terrible, tragic loss for myself and her brother Matthew. She was such a joy to be around. We miss her so much.’ Mrs Hewson’s husband David, 42, described the former national swimming champion as ‘an outgoing woman with a beautiful smile’. The couple had met while she was at university in Swansea before they emigrated to Australia. There, they married and had two children, Joe, 10, and Anna, eight, before returning to the North West seven years ago. Mr Hewson said: ‘She was loved around the world and is missed by so many people. Friends and colleagues in Australia have even named a star in her honour. She loved working at St Joseph’s [Primary School] in Shaw and they loved her too.’ The school has set up a Jillian Slater Endeavour Award at a local swimming gala in her honour. Cousin Alex Woodward added: ‘She was the type of girl who would put on high heels just to go to Asda and always looked her best. Her glass was always half-full - she saw the positives in everything. She never had a bad word to say about anyone.’ Another cousin, Joanne Lucy, said: ‘Her children are coping but are still obviously upset. We have a big supportive family so they have been taken into the fold and they are so loved by everyone. But nothing will bring her back.’ Discovery: She was found at her £150,000 three-bedroom home on this road in Royton, Greater Manchester . Mrs Hewson, who was separated from her husband, was discovered unconscious in the bath at her home by her son, who raised the alarm with neighbours shortly after 5.15pm on June 30 last year. An ambulance was called and attempts were made to revive her both by neighbours and medical professionals - however, she was pronounced dead at the Royal Oldham Hospital just after 6.30pm. The inquest, which was attended by more than a dozen relatives, heard that Mrs Hewson had suffered three blackouts in the two years before her death and had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, also known as an underactive thyroid gland, in May, 2012. The condition causes body functions, in particular the beating of the heart, to slow down and can lead to dizzy spells or blackouts as the heart struggles to pump enough oxygenated blood around the body and to the brain. Mrs Hewson was prescribed medication to combat the effects of the condition but a toxicology report did not find the drug in her system at the time of her death. However, it was suggested in the report . that she could have taken it just before her death without it being . absorbed into the system, therefore making it untraceable. She was pronounced dead at the Royal Oldham Hospital (pictured) just after 6.30pm on June 30 last year . Consultant pathologist Dr Antonio Paiva-Correia also found that she suffered from left ventricular hypertrophy, a thickening of the heart muscle, which had not previously been diagnosed. The condition, which often occurs naturally in athletes and swimmers, can also make it harder for the heart to function properly. 'We are all devastated by what has happened. She was very popular a beautiful mum, our sunshine girl' Linden Slater, mother . Dr Paiva-Correia described the cause of death as drowning where hypothyroidism, left ventricular hypertrophy and aortic valve stenosis (a narrowing of the valve controlling blood) had been contributing factors. Police also confirmed the absence of any criminal or suspicious circumstances at the scene. Senior Coroner Simon Nelson recorded a verdict of accidental death to which pre-existing natural conditions were a significant contributing factor. He said: ‘I could not believe it when I saw how many people were here today. It is a testament to Mrs Hewson, her character and the aspects of personality that made her so loved.’","Mother-of-two Jillian Hewson, 38, found at her three-bedroom house .

"By . Associated Press . A judge ruled Monday that Jodi Arias can represent herself in the upcoming penalty phase of her murder trial, where jurors will decide whether she is put to death for killing her ex-boyfriend. Arias, 34, was convicted of first-degree murder last year in the 2008 killing of Travis Alexander, but jurors couldn't reach a decision on sentencing. Under Arizona law, while Arias' murder conviction stands, prosecutors have the option of putting on a second penalty phase with a new jury in an effort to secure the death penalty. Arias, who has long clashed with her defense lawyers and tried to fire them previously, asked Judge Sherry Stephens to let her serve as her own lawyer during the second penalty phase set for September 8. Stephens granted the request but said there would be no delays. Scroll down for video . Representation: A judge has ruled, Monday that Jodi Arias, pictured in January 2013, can represent herself in the upcoming penalty phase of her murder trial . 'I do not believe it is in your best interest ... I strongly urge you to reconsider,' Stephens told Arias before granting the motion. Arias will now have the task of arguing a death penalty case just four weeks from now despite having no legal experience and no college degree or high school diploma. Arias got her GED in jail. Her defense lawyers will remain on as advisory council. They declined to comment on the latest developments. Prosecutors also declined comment. Experts say the move might not be such a bad idea given the gruesome nature of the crime. Arias admitted killing Alexander at his suburban Phoenix home but said it was self-defense. He was stabbed nearly 30 times, had his throat slit and was shot in the forehead. Prosecutors argued it was premeditated murder carried out in a jealous rage when Alexander wanted to end their affair. 'It's actually probably a good idea to represent herself,' said San Francisco-area defense attorney Daniel Horowitz. 'She looks like a vicious psychopath with a ridiculous defense.' However, Horowitz noted, the jury 'may find her pathetic.' 'If she can get just one juror to bond with her on some level, even if they hate her, they're getting to know her, and it's harder to kill someone you know,' he said. Killed: Arias murdered her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander, pictured, who was found stabbed and shot in 2008 . The five-month trial that began in January 2013 provided seemingly endless amounts of cable TV and tabloid fodder, including a recorded phone sex call between Arias and the victim, nude photos, bloody crime-scene pictures and a defendant who described her life story in intimate detail over 18 days on the witness stand. Arias told jurors of an abusive childhood, cheating boyfriends, dead-end jobs, her sexual relationship with Alexander and her contention that he had grown physically violent. 'They thought she was a liar. She was narcissistic. She was arrogant, and it made it easy to convict her,' Horowitz said. 'But that's a lot different than killing somebody.' Phoenix defense lawyer Mel McDonald, a former Maricopa County judge and federal prosecutor, agreed that Arias doesn't have much to lose. 'I think generally that anybody that represents themselves has a fool for a client, but it also gives her a way, if she's out there making a fool of herself, to maybe invoke some sympathy from a juror,' McDonald said. Arias' feud with her attorneys has been ongoing since early in the case and intensified after she gave a series of media interviews following her conviction in May 2013. Her lawyers have tried to withdraw several times, but the judge has rebuffed their requests. If the new jury fails to reach a unanimous decision, the death penalty will be removed from consideration. The judge would then sentence Arias to spend her life behind bars or to be eligible for release after 25 years.","Arias, 34, was convicted of first-degree murder last year in the 2008 killing of Travis Alexander, but jurors couldn't reach a decision on sentencing .

But now Blue Almonds, one of London’s most exclusive - and expensive - baby stores can boast that it has helped another expectant mother prepare for her imminent arrival: so-called boob job scrounger Josie Cunningham. The 24-year-old was seen browsing at the shop in South Kensington, south-west London, as she prepares to become a mother for the third time. Scroll down for video . Visit: Pregnant would-be glamour model Josie Cunningham (left) was seen shopping at one of Britain's most exclusive baby stores - Blue Almonds in South Kensington, south-west London . According to a Sunday newspaper reporter, she is said to have liked the look of a blue hat and a matching babygro, but been unimpressed by knitted booties and cardigans, saying: 'I’m just chavvy.' The store – where the Duchess of . Cambridge and her mother Carole Middleton bought a £295 wicker basket . for Prince George a few weeks before his birth – is a far cry from her . usual lifestyle. When . Kate, 32, visited in April 2013 with her mother Carole . Middleton, they spent up to an hour browsing the Moses baskets on sale, . before purchasing a large white wicker version. At . up to £295 for an off the shelf model, their prices are out of reach . for many new mothers-to-be. Some bespoke versions can cost up to £1,000 . and come with frilled fitted sheets and sun shades. Blue . Almonds boasts that it creates ‘magical rooms for children’, and . previous clients are also said to include singer Lily Allen. The owner of Blue Almonds, Izabela Minkiewicz, told online magazine Belle About Town last year: ‘I don’t just sell as much as I can, I talk to them about what they want for their nursery. Shopping trip: Miss Cunningham already has two children - and her next baby, a third boy, is due in October . ‘This is an exciting time and a busy time and I don’t want anyone to feel pressured or stressed when they’re in my shop. I like to take my time and make sure the customer is totally happy.’ The shop, which has moved its premises across the street since Kate visited, is based on a road with an average house value of £1.9million. No-one was available for comment at the store today. Last Wednesday, Miss Cunningham said she smoked a packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted' to discover her new arrival was a boy. She had been hoping it would be a little girl - and admitted she would not have done that same if the baby had been female, adding: 'I knew it could harm my child but it didn't stop me.’ Her controversial comments came after she said she wanted to pay the NHS back for her breast enlargement operation, not out of a sense of duty but in an attempt to stop people confronting her. Royal fan: When Kate, 32, visited the store in April 2013 with her mother Carole Middleton they spent up to an hour browsing the Moses baskets on sale, before purchasing a large white wicker version . Miss Cunningham, who has sold tickets to watch her give birth to her third child in October for a total of £30,000, insisted the £4,800 operation on her breasts was medically necessary. But she said that she intended to give the money back to taxpayers, who also footed the £6,000 bill for the taxis that she took on the school run, in an attempt to deflect vitriol from strangers. Miss Cunningham said her breast operation was needed because she had 'no breast tissue at all'. And the mother of boys aged six and three said she needed taxis for the school run rather than taking the bus because she feared abuse from strangers. Miss Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. Also fans: Previous clients of Blue Almonds also said to include Formula One heiress Tamara Ecclestone (left) and supermodel Claudia Schiffer (right) Exclusive: Blue Almonds, based in South Kensington, boasts that it creates 'magical rooms for children' She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. She courted further publicity when she said she was considering aborting the child she is now pregnant with so that she could take part in the Celebrity Big Brother reality TV show. Miss Cunningham later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. Eventually Leeds City Council decided to axe the service, which prompted Miss Cunningham to tweet: ‘Sticks and stones may break my bones but taxpayers will always fund me.’ She said: 'If the council think I’m getting a bus, they can think again.' Initially, she had planned to cash in on the birth of her son by selling DVDs of the event through a pound shop chain.","Pregnant would-be glamour model spotted at Blue Almonds in Kensington .

Inventor: A portrait of Lord Armstrong on the wall above a light at Cragside . Once described as a 'a palace of the modern magician', Cragside House was the first building in the world to be lit by hydroelectricity. The estate, which has more an 30 miles of footpaths and lakeside walks, features gadgets well ahead of its time such as fire alarm buttons, telephones, a passenger lift and a Turkish bath suite. It is also home to one of Europe's largest rock gardens, and features one of the oldest iron bridges of its type in Britain. In fact, its 140-year-old Scots pine tree has been verified as Britain’s tallest tree – measuring 131ft (40m). The property was created in 1863 by inventor and landscaper Lord William Armstrong, his wife Lady Margaret Armstrong, and their architect Richard Norman Shaw. Lord Armstrong became a solicitor after leaving school, but had always had an interest in mechanics - and often took apart toys as a child to find out how they worked. He became a civil and mechanical engineer and started on Cragside aged 53, before developing hydroelectricity there in 1878. Light bulbs were installed there in 1880 and visitors travelled for miles to see how he had turned the power of water into electric light. Lord Armstrong was also an armaments magnate, and effectively became chief gun manufacturer to the British Army after being knighted in 1859.

"By . Mark Duell . Elderly residents have voiced their anger at new plans to turn a shop opposite their retirement flats into a funeral parlour. Proposals put forward by Adam & Greenwood funeral directors, who currently run their office from Chelmsford, Essex, have been called ‘insensitive’. Pensioners living at the back of the building in nearby Maldon said they were distressed by the thought of having to see hearses and bodies coming and going in their older years. Proposals: Tony Sawtell (left), Jackie Sawtell (centre) and Ray Ward (right) of Adam & Greenwood funeral directors, who have been called 'insensitive' by pensioners angry at their plans for a new funeral parlour . Brian Stewart, who lives on the top floor of the retirement block, said: ‘When I look out of my windows, I look directly at this proposed funeral parlour. To think about it is so depressing. ‘My wife died in January and I'm having to get over that. But then to be faced with looking at a funeral home. It's just not on.’ Another resident, who wanted to be anonymous, said: ‘We don't need to see these sort of things in our latter stages of life. We will be facing a constant reminder that our own time might not be that far off.’ A third resident added: ‘It's just totally insensitive. The people who live here don't need to see this. We're just hoping and praying something will be done to make sure this doesn't actually go ahead.’ Ray Ward, 70, who runs Adam & Greenwood funeral directors, said he wished those concerned had spoken to him before he signed up to buy the premises, which used to be a chiropody centre. Upset: Elderly people living in a home (left, rear) at the back of the building (centre, painted white) in Maldon said they were distressed by the thought of having to see hearses and bodies coming and going . He said: ‘The strength of feeling has come as a surprise. It's not as though I'd get a trolley and wheel them across my yard. It would be done with the utmost dignity and respect. 'We don't need to see these sort of things in our latter stages of life. We will be facing a constant reminder that our own time might not be that far off' 'But I wish those people concerned by it had come forward earlier.’ Mr Ward is adamant the parlour will go ahead, because the company has a new contract to provide more out-of-hours funeral services in a larger patch. He added: ‘We now have to cover three areas, and we have to be there within an hour to collect someone, so we have to be in Maldon. I could only buy a shop, and the only shops in Maldon are in the high street - there weren't many options. ‘Who can see me from their yard was not my first concern, but I understand why people feel that way. If the planners turn me down, I will go to appeal.’","Proposals from Adam & Greenwood funeral directors called 'insensitive'

"By . Richard Spillett . and Mark Duell . Prince George is having a great time at swimming lessons, the Duchess of Cambridge said today. Kate told former world and Commonwealth champion swimmer James Hickman that her young son was already a fan of the water - and enjoys 'grabbing things to splash with'. Mr Hickman, 38, asked her if she had taken the Prince, who celebrated his first birthday recently, swimming yet. Scroll down for videos . Fan of the water: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are pictured with Prince George. Kate said her young son already enjoys 'grabbing things to splash with' The sportsman, from Manchester, later said: 'She was at the swimming last night, so I was just interested to know if she had taken George swimming. ‘Hopefully if they can get him swimming he could be a future international swimmer. She’s been swimming with him. ‘She said he loves the water and he grabs things to splash with. So, maybe he could be the next royal to take part in the Olympics, and if he was in swimming that would be incredible.' The Mail revealed last Saturday how George was enjoying weekly swimming lessons with his mother, the Duchess of Cambridge, in the historic pool at Buckingham Palace. On his first birthday last week, George was seen being driven into Buckingham Palace by his mother, accompanied by his nanny Maria Borallo and a police protection officer, on what was believed to be a visit to his grandparents. In fact, he was off to enjoy his weekly splash-about. The pool, which is situated at the rear of the palace, was converted from a conservatory in 1938 and has been used by generations of royal children, including Prince Charles and his siblings, Andrew, Edward and Anne. More recently, George’s late grandmother, Diana, Princess of Wales, visited each week as part of her fitness regime, as well as using it to teach her sons William and Harry how to swim. Now George is continuing the family tradition with regular dips with his mother when the family are in London. A source said: ‘The Duchess brings him up to the palace every week now.’ Question: Former world and Commonwealth champion swimmer James Hickman (pictured) asked Kate if she had taken the Prince, who celebrated his first birthday recently, swimming yet . At a recent event to highlight his new . presidency of the British Sub-Aqua Club, Prince William told how George . loves splashing around and that bath-time has become ‘quite painful’. His . own father Prince Charles also revealed he instilled a love of water in . his son from an early age. ‘I threw him in the swimming pool on . occasions. Instead of putting him off, it enthused him,’ he said. 'She said he loves the water and he grabs things to splash with. So, maybe he could be the next royal to take part in the Olympics, and if he was in swimming that would be incredible' James Hickman, former swimmer . Former swimmer Mr . Hickman had chatted to Kate at a reception hosted by the charity SportsAid, . which gives financial support to the talented young athletes to help . them reach the top and compete internationally. The . Duchess is the charity’s patron and its newest ambassador is tennis . star Laura Robson, who was also at this morning’s reception hosting a . mentoring session for young sportswomen. More . than 450 of the home nations athletes competing at Glasgow 2014 have . received support from SportsAid, including Bradley Wiggins for Team . England, Daniel Keatings for Team Scotland, Michael Conlan for Team . Northern Ireland and Geraint Thomas for Team Wales. Miss Robson said she was 'so happy' to be involved with SportsAid after it was announced yesterday she was their latest ambassador. The tennis player added that Kate’s involvement had been a 'massive help' in boosting awareness of the charity’s work. Watching on: The Duke and Duchess attended a swimming event at Tollcross Pool in Glasgow yesterday . She said: 'To have someone as high . profile as the Duchess being part of the organisation makes a massive . difference. She really wants to get involved, it’s so good to have her . on board.' Fifteen-year-old . swimmer Tom Hamer, who won silver for England in the Commonwealth Games . Para-sport S14 200 metres freestyle, told how meeting the Duchess was . more nerve-racking than competing in the final. He said: 'I was more nervous meeting the Duchess, meeting the royal family is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.' Kate also watched rower Joshua Armstrong, 16, from Hamilton, being put through his paces on a rowing machine. He said: 'She was asked if she wanted to have a go, but she said she couldn’t because of her skirt.' He added: 'I was more nervous meeting her than I was when I was competing in the British championships, but when I started talking to her she was really nice.' While Kate was at the SportsAid reception, the Duke of Cambridge and his brother Prince Harry met young coaches at a training project in Glasgow.","Kate says George enjoys 'grabbing things to splash with' in the pool .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Mark Duell . An injured First World War soldier was unknowingly saved at Gallipoli by his brother who had been asked to take the last stretcher and bring back a ‘wounded officer’, it was revealed today. Montague Parish, of Croydon, south London, was hit by a sniper’s bullet during a bayonet charge at Gallipoli during the war in 1915, before his brother Stanley went back to save his life. And - in a further twist to his story - after arriving at hospital, Montague was thought to be dead and a sheet was placed over his head, before a nurse saw a slight movement and realised he was alive. Scroll down for video . Soldiers: Montague Parish (left) was hit by a sniper’s bullet during a bayonet charge at Gallipoli. He survived, but his brother Stanley (right) stayed in battle - and was within two weeks of leaving when killed by Turks . Holding his father's medals: Montague Parish's 88-year-old son John (pictured) has revealed the soldier's story . Gallipoli landings: This image of Anzac Cove provides one of the most famous views from the First World War campaign in 1915. Montague Parish survived the landings, but his brother Stanley never returned home . Now, his son John, 88, has revealed . how close the former banker came to dying - before . living for another 50 years until he passed away following an operation for . stomach cancer. Mr Parish, . who was known as ‘Monty’, served in the Territorial Army with his . brother Stanley and they entered the war on its first day in 1914. The . next year, they arrived in Gallipoli on August 9. Monty . was moving forward in a bayonet charge when he was hit by a sniper’s . bullet – and later described it as being like ‘walking into a wall’, . according to his son. The . soldier laid down in no man’s land - before, unbeknown to him, his . brother Stanley was asked to take the last stretcher and bring back a . ‘wounded officer’. This turned out to be Monty.

From the family: A remembrance note for Stanley Parish, who saved the life of his brother Montague in the war . Childhood photo: Montague and Stanley Parish as boys. The brothers 'weren't very close' before the war . Monty . was taken back to Britain to Manchester Hospital for 10 operations in a . 17-month period - during which nurses thought he was dead, before saving him. He later went back into banking. 'My father was moving forward in a bayonet charge when he was hit by a sniper’s bullet. He said it was like walking into a wall' John Parish, son of Montague . Stanley stayed in battle - and never returned home. He . was within two weeks of leaving when Turkish sappers dug a . tunnel under his men and blew them up in December 1914. He died in the blast and is buried on the side of a hill there. John . said: ‘My father, Monty Parish, who entered the bank in 1913 and his . brother Stanley were in the Territorial Army which was lodged the other . side of the road from where they lived. ‘They . weren’t very close. They decided that instead of keep arguing they . would just not talk to each other. They sailed to Gallipoli and went . ashore on August 9. ‘900 . men and 27 officers landed and were immediately in the battle. Only 300 . men came out and five officers. My father was moving forward in a . bayonet charge when he was hit by a sniper’s bullet.' Troops going ashore at the Dardanelles: Soldiers are seen leaving S.S. Nile for the landing beach . Troops arriving at Gallipoli: At the height of the fighting, waters around the area were stained red with blood . Conflict: A landing ship down by the stern, at one of the Gallipoli beaches. Battle smoke is in the background . John, who said he has read the Daily Mail for 40 years, added: ‘He . said it was like walking into a wall. 'He said he laid down in no man’s . land thinking he would never see Croydon again or his mother - and, . unbeknown to him, his brother Stanley was asked to take the last . stretcher and bring back a wounded officer. 'He laid down in no man’s land thinking he would never see Croydon again or his mother - and unbeknown to him, his brother Stanley was asked to take the last stretcher and bring back a wounded officer' John Parish, son of Montague . ‘Stanley . came across his brother and although they never spoke to each other, . they obviously spoke to each other now because Stanley said Monty was a . “very brave man”.’ The story . emerged in a huge project by HSBC and the Imperial War Museum to research . the lives of 4,000 Midland Bank staff who fought in the war, thanks to . an archive of employee index cards that was discovered in the 1970s. HSBC . staff have volunteered to . transcribing the war cards digitally - and they are now available on the . Lives of the First World War website. The background to the Gallipoli landings was one of deadlock on the Western Front in 1915, when the British hoped to capture Constantinople. The Russians were under threat from the Turks in the Caucasus and needed help, so the British decided to bombard and try to capture Gallipoli. Located on the western coast of the Dardanelles, the British hoped by eventually getting to Constantinople that they would link up with the Russians. Shelling: Anzac soldiers who arrived on the narrow strip of beach were faced with steep cliffs and ridges . The intention of this was to then knock Turkey out of the war. A naval attack began on February 19 but it was called off after three battleships were sunk. Then by the time of another landing on April 25, the Turks had been given time to prepare better fortifications and increased their armies sixfold. Australian and New Zealand troops won a bridgehead at Anzac Cove as the British aimed to land at five points in Cape Helles - but only managed three. The British still required reinforcements in these areas and the Turkish were able to bring extra troops onto the peninsula to better defend themselves. Graphically explained: This is a Daily Mail First World War panorama map showing the Gallipoli peninsula . A standstill continued through the summer in hot and filthy conditions, and the campaign was eventually ended by the War Council in winter 1915. The invasion had been intended to knock Turkey out of the war, but in the end it only gave the Russians some breathing space from the Turks. Turkey lost around 300,000 men and the Allies had 214,000 killed - more than 8,000 of whom were Australian soldiers, in a disastrous campaign. Anzac Cove became a focus for Australian pride after forces were stuck there in squalid conditions for eight months, defending the area from the Turks. British Marines on guard in the Dardanelles: The background was one of deadlock on the Western Front . The Anzac soldiers who arrived on the narrow strip of beach were faced with a difficult environment of steep cliffs and ridges - and almost daily shelling. At the height of the fighting during the landings of April 25, 1915, the waters around the peninsula were stained red with blood at one point 150ft out. Fierce resistance from the under-rated Ottoman forces, inhospitable terrain and bungled planning spelt disaster for the campaign.","Montague Parish was hit by sniper's bullet during a bayonet charge in 1915 .

"By . Mark Duell . It was the fight that made a national hero out of German commander Paul von Hindenburg, after his forces crushingly overcame the Russians. Now, 100 years on from the crucial Battle of Tannenberg, some 200 history enthusiasts gathered today on a hilly area in Poland for its reconstruction. The critical engagement between the invading Russian Second Army and the German Eighth Army took place in the early days of the First World War. Historic: Members of a military club participate in the reenactment of The Battle of Tannenberg on the battlefield at Szkotowo in northern Poland . Fighting: Actors dressed as German and Russian soldiers take part in the reenactment ahead of the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War . Engagement: The battle was fought by the Russian Second Army against the German Eighth Army between August 26 and 30, 1914 . Location: The reenactment was held on the site of the original battle, which in 1914 was in eastern Prussia, but which now lies in Szkotowo, Poland . Hats off: The reenactment took place just one day before the 100th anniversary of the start of the war, although the original battle took place in August 1914 . Problem: The lack of effective communication between the two Russian armies - separated by the Masurian Lakes - greatly contributed to their downfall . The reenactment was held on the site of the original battle, which in 1914 was in eastern Prussia, but which now lies in Szkotowo, northern Poland. It took place just one day before the 100th anniversary of the start of the war, although the battle itself took place from August 26 to 30, 1914. That month, two Russian armies had invaded German East Prussia. The first was under Paul von Rennenkampf and the second Aleksandr Samsonov. Rennenkampf’s army defeated eight divisions of the German Eighth Army at Gumbinnen on August 20 - but did not make contact with Samsonov. Then, German commanders Erich . Ludendorff and Hindenburg launched a huge attack against Samsonov’s . isolated army at Tannenberg on August 26. The . lack of effective communication between the two Russian armies - . separated by the Masurian Lakes - greatly contributed to their downfall. Surrender: History enthusiasts from across Europe gathered in northern Poland to reconstruct the Battle of Tannenberg . Tactics: The Germans intercepted wireless messages from both Samsonov and Rennenkampf, and surprised the former's army with a strong attack . Riding: Samsonov lost half of his army during the first few days of the conflict and shot himself on August 30. By the end the Germans had taken 92,000 prisoners . Numbers: The Russians had had more than 50,000 killed, while the Germans only suffered a total of 13,000 casualties. Dressed up: Actors dressed as Russian soldiers perform an attack, as another actor dressed as an orthodox priest, left, prays, during the reenactment . Important moment: Tannenberg was a significant defeat for the Russians, who had lost almost an entire army along with 400 guns and other weapons . Helping hand: The battle made a national hero out of German commander Paul von Hindenburg, after his forces crushingly overcame the Russians . The Germans intercepted wireless messages from both Samsonov and Rennenkampf, and surprised the former’s army with a strong attack. Samsonov lost half of his army over the next few days and shot himself on August 30. By the end the Germans had taken 92,000 prisoners. Meanwhile the Russians had had more than 50,000 killed, while the Germans only suffered a total of 13,000 casualties. One . of the next fights that took place was the Battle of the Marne, which . saw British and French troops defeat Germans advancing towards Paris. However, . Tannenberg was a significant defeat for the Russians, who had lost . almost an entire army along with 400 guns and other weapons. The . battle also saw Hindenburg first come under the national spotlight, . before the highly-decorated field marshal became Germany's president in . 1925. Onwards: Russian soldiers charge at Tannenberg, during a First World War battle that they would eventually lose . Over the top: A memorial was later constructed on the site to honour the German soldiers who died during the 1914 battle. Here, Cossacks are pictured on the attack .

Directions: This map shows what happened up to and including the battle, with Rennenkampf's army defeating the Germans at Gumbinnen on August 20 . Mapped out: The Battle of Tannenberg happened on ground in what is now the village of Szkotowo in northern Poland . The victory also brought renown for Ludendorff, and saw him made quartermaster general when Hindenburg was appointed chief of staff in 1916. The fight is also sometimes known as the second Battle of Tannenberg, with the first taking place in 1410 when the Poles defeated the Teutonic Knights. A memorial was constructed on the site under the direction of Hindenburg in 1927 to honour the German soldiers who died during the 1914 battle. When Hindenburg died in 1934, his coffin was placed there and Adolf Hitler ordered the monument to be redesigned and renamed. However, as the Russians approached in 1945, German troops removed Hindenburg's remains. The site was then demolished by the Polish in 1950.","Battle made national hero out of German commander Paul von Hindenburg, after his forces overcame Russians .

"By . Mark Duell . These Commonwealth Games have been the first to see boxers fighting without protective headgear - and it certainly showed today as blood poured down competitors' faces. The International Boxing Association decided last year to stop the use of headgear in male bouts, citing medical experts who said it would help reduce concussions. The organisation said medical studies showed wearing headgear diffused blows to the head and allowed boxers to sustain more head shots - and potential brain damage - for longer periods of time.

Punch: Efe Ajagba of Nigeria (right) and Paul Schafer of South Africa (left). The bout today was stopped due to the injury on Schafer's face . England boxing team leader John Hallam . said he has only heard positive comments about the move, which will not . affect female fighters and younger boxers. But its critics include British pro George Groves, who said last year: 'They need the protection headguards give at this stage of their careers. I get paid to get hit in the head. These kids don't.' Today, . south London super-heavyweight Joe Joyce guaranteed at least a bronze . medal for England after pummelling Scotland's Ross Henderson to defeat . in Glasgow. Joyce . clubbed Henderson to the canvas four times and forced five standing . counts before the referee had seen enough and waved off the contest in . the dying seconds. It was an . emphatic performance from the European bronze medallist who will face . Uganda's Mike Sekabembe for a place in the final later this week.

Joyce said: ‘That's one more down and two more to go. I've fought him twice before and I knew he'd come forward having a go so I knew what I needed to do. ‘Obviously I want to go in and finish him off, but I don't want to go in and catch a shot on the way in so had to stay switched on and watch out for the big hook to the jaw.’ Motherwell's flyweight firebrand Reece McFadden also guaranteed a medal after beating Botswana's Oteng Oteng via a unanimous decision.

Pummelled: Malaysia's Muhammad Alnazirul Othman bleeds in his match against Australia's Nick Cooney in the Men's light Round of 32 at the SECC . McFadden boxed in a much more controlled manner, mindful of a cut he sustained above his left eye in the first round. McFadden said: ‘That was the toughest fight I've had so far and I knew I just had to hold it in and especially when I got the cut. ‘I'd like to think I can cope with the pressure, I definitely feel like I'm getting closer and there's no reason that gold shouldn't be mine.’ Northern Ireland's Ruari Dalton failed to book a semi-final meeting with McFadden when he was outpointed by Australia's Andrew Moloney in the quarter-finals.

"By . Mark Duell . Two military jets were scrambled last night after contact was lost with a private aeroplane in the skies above London. The Royal Air Force aircraft - understood to be Typhoons - were deployed as a precaution after air traffic controllers were unable to communicate with the Learjet at about 7pm yesterday. It was accompanied by the military aircraft to London Stansted Airport in Essex, where it landed safely shortly before 8pm. In the air: Two RAF aircraft - understood to be Typhoons (file picture) - were deployed as a precaution after air traffic controllers were unable to communicate with a private jet at about 7pm yesterday . Private plane: Air traffic control organisation Nats could not make contact with the Learjet (file picture) An Essex Police spokesman said: ‘Military jets were deployed on a precautionary basis when a private jet was diverted to Stansted. This was due to a loss of communication with the aircraft. ‘The aircraft landed safely at Stansted Airport at 7.49pm. All three people who were on board have been spoken to by police, it was established that everything was in order and the police response was stood down.’ The Ministry of Defence confirmed the aircraft were deployed because of a break in radio contact but a spokesman stressed there was ‘no threat’. The runway at the airport was shut for eight minutes before normal operations resumed. A spokesman for air traffic control . organisation Nats (National Air Traffic Services) said: ‘We couldn’t . make voice communication with the aircraft which is why it was escorted . to Stansted.’ An RAF spokesman told MailOnline: 'We can confirm that .

"By . Mark Duell . A son found his parents dead in their swimming pool after they both suffered fatal heart attacks. Nayyar Siddique, 77, collapsed during her regular exercise session in the pool of their garden at their £625,000 four-bedroom detached house in Thorpe Bay, Essex. Husband Aqeel, 79, a retired surgeon who had mixed with royalty, jumped in to save her - but then also suffered a fatal heart attack, and their son Haroon Siddique, 49, found them both later that day. Respected couple: Nayyar (left), 77, and Aqeel Siddique (right), 79, both suffered fatal heart attacks in the swimming pool of their garden at their home in Thorpe Bay, Essex, and were found dead by their son . He said: ‘My father dedicated his life to helping people and he died trying to help my mother. ‘We are very proud of everything they achieved and that gives us some solace. They were amazing people and were amazing examples to follow.’ Mrs Siddique was found in the pool while her husband was found in the back garden close to the pool edge. An Essex Police spokesman said: ‘Officers were called to an address at around 7.45pm on Tuesday, July 15, after a man and a woman, both aged in their 70s, were found dead in the rear garden. ‘There are no suspicious circumstances. A report will be prepared for the coroner.’ The Indian-born couple dedicated their lives to aiding others. Mr Siddique was renowned for working as a surgeon in Lesotho, Africa, while his wife fundraised for Save the Children there. Visit: In 1988, Mr Siddique met Pope John Paul II during his visit to Lesotho as part of his anti-apartheid stance. The pair met at a hospital in the aftermath of a terrorist attack as Mr Siddique treated many of the injured . They had moved there with their two children, Saima and Haroon, in 1969. The family became close friends with Lesotho’s royal family, who still visit Thorpe Bay to keep in touch. 'My father dedicated his life to helping people and he died trying to help my mother' Haroon Siddique, son . They worked to give aid to poverty-stricken families and had met the likes of Prince Harry, Princess Anne, and Pope John Paul II. They moved to Thorpe Bay to be near . their two children and four grandchildren, after ill health forced Mr . Siddique to retire as a surgeon in 2012. Mr and Mrs Siddique died on . July 15. Their son Haroon . added: ‘The most important thing was they had been with us and their . grandchildren for the last couple of years. They were really dedicated . grandparents and being able to see them was a plus for both them and . us.’ Their home: The couple lived in this £625,000 four-bedroom detached house in Thorpe Bay, Essex . Mr . and Mrs Siddique brushed shoulders with royalty and even the Pope, but . remained humble in their quest to help the less fortunate. The . couple, who were both born in India, married in 1960 and first moved to . England in 1962 so Mr Siddique could train as a surgeon. He qualified . in 1965 and went on to Lesotho, where he became the country’s only . surgeon in 1969. He . was only supposed to be there on a year’s placement, but the couple’s . passion to help improve the lives of the country’s 1million citizens saw . them stay. They developed a . strong friendship with the royal family of Lesotho - King Moshoeshoe II . and his sons - the current king King Letsie and Prince Seeiso. Aerial view: This is the swimming pool in the garden of the couple's house in Thorpe Bay where they died . King . Letsie and Prince Seeiso remained good friends with the family and . visited Essex to visit the couple and their two children Saima, 53, and . Haroon. Discovery: The couple were found dead in Essex by their son, father-of-three Haroon Siddique, 49 . Prince Seeiso, who started the charity Sentebele with Prince Harry, even came over to open Southend Medical Centre in 2010. Mr Siddique developed many new medical services to help residents especially in the more remote areas of the country. He repeatedly refused to move into the private sector, wanting to help those who needed it most. His hard work and dedication to the people of Lesotho meant he was awarded an OBE in 1973, aged just 38. He . was also awarded the Order of Mothlomi by the King of Lesotho, the . highest award a civilian can get, for his work and dedication to the . country’s people. In September 1988, Mr Siddique met Pope John Paul II during his visit to Lesotho as part of his anti-apartheid stance. The . pair met at the hospital in the aftermath of a terrorist attack as Mr . Siddique treated many of the injured, whom the Pope wanted to meet. In 2005, Mr Siddique was made the Honorary Consular of Pakistan in Lesotho. Meanwhile Mrs . Siddique was dedicating her . life by working with Save the Children in Lesotho to bring aid to the . country. Joining forces with . the Queen of Lesotho, Mrs Siddique fundraised to take aid to the remote . mountain villages, ensuring they recieved food and goods. Their . son Haroon said: ‘My father had a passion for teaching and . supported and guided many young doctors in their training who have . subsequently enjoyed successful medical careers all over the world. ‘My . mother was a steadfast partner of his throughout his life and provided . her children and grandchildren the support, guidance and love which will . remain with them all. Royal approval: Aqueel Siddique (right, wearing a grey suit) meets King Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho (left, tallest) ‘She was instrumental in the early . work the Save the Children organisation did in Lesotho and assisted in . much charity work. They . dedicated their lives to those people. Now we are hearing from people . all over the world calling to send their condolences.’ 'Though they met many famous and important people in their lives, they remained humble people' Haroon Siddique . A . memorial service is being organised in their honour in Lesotho. He . added: ‘Though they met many famous and important people in their lives, . they remained humble people. ‘My father’s passion and joy was the work he did as a surgeon, helping and treating the poor and needy people in Lesotho.’ Haroon’s children, Rahil, 22 and Mariam, 19, are in medical school. His . younger daughter Imaan, 14, also wants to study medicine.

A group of Tesco night workers were today celebrating a £3.7million lottery win after one of them asked their daughter to buy the ticket - because seagull droppings had landed on her. The 15 colleagues who all work at the same branch of the supermarket in Roborough, Devon, each scooped £245,996 in the massive win - with the numbers 5, 9, 14, 25, 34 and 38. Syndicate leader Jackie Beresford, 56, who has worked at Tesco, who pay colleagues around £7 per hour, since 2007, first suspected her luck might be in when she visited a psychic who said her financial situation would soon improve. Tesco lottery winners: (From left) Sheila Bird, Kay Richards, Clare O'Carroll, Tina Carpenter, Jackie Beresford, Sarah Wheatley, Vanessa Rice, Mandy Bunker and Alison Lonsdale . Syndicate leader: Jackie Beresford (left), 56, first suspected her luck might be in when she visited a psychic who said her financial situation would soon improve. Another of her fellow winners was Kay Richards (right) But the mother-of-five later decided not to buy the weekly ticket as usual - and leave the purchase to her daughter, who had been struck by seagull droppings. Mrs Beresford said: ‘My daughter and her husband and their daughter were at a Christening when a seagull left its mark, so to speak. ‘In my book that’s a sign of good luck to come and I suggested she bought the syndicate tickets - and it came true.’ The workers, who formed a syndicate in 2010, won £3,689,940. They have had a number of smaller wins previously, meaning they were able to share out a few hundred pounds each Christmas. They now plan to spend their winnings on paying off mortgages and family holidays - while one member of the syndicate, Mandy Bunker, 48, said she would spend it on new teeth. Nine of the 15 winners who have agreed to go public were celebrating their new-found fortune today. Toast: The 15 colleagues who all work at the same branch of the supermarket in Roborough, Devon, have each scooped £245,996 following the massive win with the numbers 5, 9, 14, 25, 34 and 38 . 'Life-changing': At a press conference at The Duke of Cornwall Hotel in Plymouth today, the women said the win 'makes life a lot easier' Mrs Beresford, who was widowed earlier this year when her husband of 26 years David died of cancer, had also visited a psychic two weeks before the win. She said: ‘She told me my husband had one . regret, that he had not left me in a better financial situation - but . that he had a plan. I just know he’s shining down on me and looking . after me, and this was his way of doing it. 'One thing is for certain, by the end of this week my house will be my own. We’ve decided we will all cut back on shifts but none of us will stop working' Jackie Beresford, syndicate leader . 'I know most of us just haven’t had the time to think about what we’re planning to spend some of the money on. But I know what I will be doing first and that’s paying off my mortgage so I’ll have no more worries on that front. One thing is for certain, by the end of this week my house will be my own. ‘We’ve decided we will all cut back on shifts but none of us will stop working.’ All . 15 of the syndicate live in the Plymouth area and work together on the . 10pm-7am shift at the Tesco Roborough store, where they ensure the . shelves are re-stocked overnight. Mrs Beresford was working the night shift on Saturday when she got a call saying the syndicate had won. Hooray: The Tesco night shift workers, who formed a syndicate in 2010, won a total of £3,689,940 . Delighted: Nine of the 15 winners who have agreed to go public are celebrating their new-found fortune . She said: ‘We’re a pretty close-knit group and get on really well together and some of us were at work on the night shift when we found out about our win after last Saturday’s draw. ‘I had a call from one of the members to say we’d won the jackpot and I just screamed. I don’t know how we finished that night shift, but we did - with the help of a glass of champagne. 'It’s life changing to us - it just makes life a lot easier' Alison Lonsdale, winner . ‘I’m just glad the winning ticket is now out of my house. I hid it in a DVD cassette box, but I was terrified I might lose it. ‘Clare’s numbers were completely random - she wanted numbers that nobody had.’ Grandmother-of-eight Mrs Beresford also plans to treat her children to a holiday. Other syndicate members going public included Sarah Wheatley, 46, Kay Richards, 56, Tina Carpenter, 46, Vanessa Rice, 47, Alison Lonsdale, 45, and Sheila Bird, 50. At a press conference at The Duke of Cornwall Hotel in Plymouth, Ms Lonsdale, who works as a primary school dinner lady as well as part time at the store, said: ‘It’s life changing to us - it just makes life a lot easier.’","Colleagues from branch in Roborough, Devon, each scoop £245,996 .

Stained glass window: Since the couple began to start renting out Ges, it has been so popular that people are 'booking three months in advance' Mrs Harris said: ‘It all started in September 2011 when Gary came home one day saying he had a crazy idea to buy a horse box that we could convert into a sort of retro motorhome. 'It was battered and rusty and still smelled of horses, and had spent 10 years lying dormant in a farmer’s field with brambles growing through it' Yvonne Harris . ‘We wanted to have something we could use as an escape from our hectic landscape gardening jobs, but when Gary took me to see this horse box I was less than impressed. ‘It was battered and rusty and still smelled of horses, and had spent 10 years lying dormant in a farmer’s field with brambles growing through it. ‘However it was very mechanically sound and Gary was adamant this was the one for us and so I went along with it. As soon as we got it home I started to fall in love with it. ‘There was something really magical about it.

The unnamed woman, who is in her early 40s, suffered a powerful single blow from a girl believed to be aged just 14 - after she arrived at the public park to pick up her daughter in the early evening. She had challenged a group of youngsters after seeing them throw newly-installed swings up and over mountings at Leyland Park in Wigan, Greater Manchester. Injuries: The unnamed woman, who is in her early 40s, suffered a powerful single blow from a girl believed to be aged just 14 after she arrived at the public park to pick up her daughter in the early evening . The victim, who does not want to be named, was floored and left dazed after being punched by the girl - who she believes she has identified via Facebook. Because the mother has a job which involves dealing with the public face to face, she has had to take time off work and may lose income while the black bruising to her partially closed right eye subsides. She said: ‘I did what I what hope most people in their right minds would do. ‘The council has spent a lot of money, which at the end of the day is our money, doing a nice job refurbishing the park - but some of these children just love being destructive. ‘I went there to collect my daughter and could see out of the corner of my eye a group of teenage children throwing the swings over the top of the frame they are mounted on. ‘That kind of vandalism, particularly with the play equipment being so new, really annoys me and I am the type of person to challenge it.

The Radio 5 Live presenter said the incident in Clapham, south London, left him ‘extremely upset’ after he questioned the yobs for ripping open bin bags and kicking rubbish all over his street. Campbell, 53, admitted that he had to be comforted afterwards by his wife Tina, but did not regret his actions and would probably do the same again.","Unnamed woman in early 40s suffered beating at Leyland Park in Wigan .

Structure: The Victorian seaside landmark is on the market with Colchester-based East Anglian Renovations, which bought it two years ago . The promenade, formerly owned by the Marquess of Bristol whose family seat was Ickworth House in Bury St Edmunds, was originally a toll pier. That enabled people to take the boat trip. The Royal Navy’s famous HMS Ganges training ship and centre was set up at the pier in 1905.

"By . Mark Duell . A ‘significant’ number of the 2.5million trees lining Britain’s rail network today faced being chopped down - in an effort to stop them being blown onto tracks during severe weather and causing delays. Some 1,500 trees or branches fell onto the 20,000-mile network last winter, which was the stormiest period of UK weather experienced for two decades, according to a Department for Transport report. About a third of these incidents resulted in collisions, with 430 cases of trains striking trees or branches over the winter - often significantly damaging trains and disrupting services. Danger: Some 1,500 trees or branches fell onto the 20,000-mile network last winter, according to a report. Pictured is a tree blocking the line at Gartshore in Dunbartonshire, Scotland, last December . Network Rail's current policy on vegetation is to clear trees and bushes to 10ft (3m) to 16ft (5m) from the rail depending on line speed, and 11ft 6in (3.5m) from overhead power lines. But the report said: ‘This policy in no way adequately addresses the risk of trees being blown onto the line in high winds, or the damage they can do to the long term stability of slopes. ‘It is not clear to us that there is a defined budget for vegetation management… We consider that Network Rail needs to substantially strengthen its vegetation management policy.’ The report recommends that Network Rail develops a ten-year strategy to 'significantly' reduce the number of lineside trees - but also offsets the loss of vegetation by planting trees further away. Last winter Britain was hit by 13 major storms, including the St Jude’s Storm on October 28, 2013 which hit an extraordinary 99mph at The Needles Old Battery at Totland Bay on the Isle of Wight. Clearing the line: Network Rail has been advised to develop a ten-year strategy to significantly reduce the number of lineside trees - but also offset the loss of vegetation by planting trees further away . Most of the damage caused by that storm was associated with falling trees, which were still in full leaf at that time of year - and the tempest was within the ten worst to affect the South in 40 years. 'It will not be possible to make our transport systems totally resilient - the forces of nature will still on occasions prove too powerful' Richard Brown, report author . Network Rail believes that 25,000 of the 2.5million lineside trees with a trunk diameter of at least 5.9in (15cm) are in a risk category - based on the likelihood of them falling, their location and size. Former Eurostar chairman Richard Brown, who authored the Transport Resilience Review, said: ‘There is no silver bullet or instant solution to make our transport systems more resilient - instead it is a task of attending to 101 details. ‘But by prioritising our efforts, applying already good practices much more widely and ensuring that transport operators and authorities learn continuously from other's experience as well as their own, there is much that can be achieved. Report: Former Eurostar chairman Richard Brown (pictured), who authored the Transport Resilience Review, said there is 'no silver bullet or instant solution to make our transport systems more resilient' ‘It will not be possible to make our transport systems totally resilient - the forces of nature will still on occasions prove too powerful. 'But where there is disruption there is . more that can be done to minimise its duration and impact, and to . improve how passengers and road users are communicated with.’ 'The damage and disruption caused by fallen trees on the railway last winter underlined the need for a more proactive approach to the way we manage what grows along the tracks' Network Rail spokesman . The report came with 60 recommendations and also looked at the highways network, proposing for example that driving theory tests should have questions on how to cope with bad weather. A Network Rail spokesman told MailOnline today: ‘The damage and disruption caused by fallen trees on the railway last winter underlined the need for a more proactive approach to the way we manage what grows along the tracks. ‘It’s no coincidence that HS1, which was built to modern engineering standards with appropriate levels of trackside vegetation, was unaffected by the extreme weather. ‘Our new vegetation management . strategy seeks to strike the right balance between encouraging . biodiversity on the railway and protecting the network from fallen . trees, focusing on known high-risk locations. ‘As part of this strategy, we will be . working closely with local communities and environmental groups to . discuss how best to manage any significant reduction in lineside . vegetation.’ Keeping back: Network Rail's current policy on vegetation is to clear trees and bushes to 10ft (3m) to 16ft (5m) from the rail depending on line speed, and 11ft 6in (3.5m) from overhead power lines . However, a Wildlife Trust spokesman told the Daily Express: ‘Cutting down trees by railways can cause damage, such as where mature woodland is established. ‘The . railway network can also be an important corridor for wildlife, and . clearance of trees along it should be part of a wider conservation plan. But in some places removing trees could help boost wildflower . grassland.’ 'The railway network can also be an important corridor for wildlife, and clearance of trees along it should be part of a wider conservation plan' Wildlife Trust spokesman . And Bob Elliot, the head of RSPB investigations, told MailOnline: ‘The habitat alongside the rail network could provide one of our greatest nature reserves. ‘Over the last three years, we have been advising Network Rail and reminding them that clearing scrub and trees during the sensitive spring and summer nesting period may not only threaten nesting birds, but is also potentially against the law. ‘Any removal of trees and dense vegetation should be undertaken sensitively with a programme of replacement planting, habitat creation and management - this could actually create many more homes for nature. ‘There seems to be a great opportunity here to dramatically improve Network Rail’s estate for the benefit of wildlife, but this work needs to be planned ahead of time, to avoid threatening nesting birds and other breeding species.’","1,500 trees/branches fell onto UK's 20,000-mile train network last winter .

"By . Mark Duell . The notorious father jailed for killing his six children in a house fire has been given free false teeth on the NHS, it was claimed today. Mick Philpott, 57, who is serving life in prison for the manslaughter of six of his 17 children in Derby, has received the treatment at high-security jail HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire. Like all prisoners, the killer - found guilty along with his wife Mairead of the manslaughter of their children Jade, John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Duwayne - receives free dental treatment on the NHS. Rotted away: Mick Philpott, pictured with his wife Mairead at a press conference in May 2012 following the fire at their home, has been given free false teeth on the NHS . Monster and his victims: Mick Philpott with the children he killed - from top left, John, nine, Duwayne, 13, Jack, seven, Jessie, six, Jayden, five, and Jade, ten - at their council home in Derby in 2012 . He has even written to Mrs Philpott, 33, to tell her how ‘handsome’ he feels with the new teeth - which would have cost most people outside jail hundreds of pounds, according to the Sunday Mirror. A prison source told journalist Phil Cardy: ‘[Mr] Philpott is over the moon with them, but taxpayers won’t be quite as pleased. Before he was jailed he was too tight to pay for his own dental treatment. ‘Even on his wedding day he went down the aisle with just a mouthful of gums. He lost his teeth because they all rotted away. But now he’s got a full set on the taxpayer.’ In March it was reported that Mrs Philpott, was sentenced to 17 years for manslaughter last year, was reportedly planning to divorce her husband while they were both still behind bars. It is thought Mrs Philpott - who hopes to be out of jail by her 40th birthday - has been exchanging romantic letters with Paul Mosely, 47, who was also jailed for 17 years for his part in the crime. Jail: Mick Philpott is serving life in prison at high-security HMP Wakefield in West Yorkshire (pictured inside) Blaze: Mr Philpott led his wife Mairead and Paul Mosely in a scheme to get a bigger council house by burning down his home in Derby (pictured) and framing ex-lover Lisa Willis for the crime . Mr Philpott led the trio in a scheme to get a bigger council house by burning down his home and framing ex-lover Lisa Willis for the crime. 'Even on his wedding day he went down the aisle with just a mouthful of gums. He lost his teeth because they all rotted away. But now he’s got a full set on the taxpayer' HMP Wakefield source . His intention was to rescue the sleeping children through an upstairs window but the fire claimed the lives of Duwayne, 13, Jade, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five. He was sentenced to life behind bars for the crime. The father of 17, who married Mrs Philpott in 2003, used his children to drag in an astonishing £60,000 a year in benefits. Mr Philpott, who had previously been jailed for stabbing his schoolgirl lover 27 times, wove a web of lies trying to get away with the crime. He even plotted to 'get rich quick' off generous donations from the local community meant to pay for the funerals of his children. Mrs Philpott is in jail at HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, Surrey. The Ministry of Justice referred media enquiries to NHS England. A request for comment has been left with the NHS England press office.","Mick Philpott is serving life in jail for manslaughter of six of his 17 children .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Mark Duell . BT Sport was today forced to apologise after cutting to an advert break while the Newcastle United manager and captain were laying wreaths on the seats of two fans who died in the MH17 disaster. Producers only cut back to the Newcastle v Sydney FC match - following five adverts for other brands and one for their own - for half of the minute’s silence for John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28. Viewers took to Twitter to vent their fury, describing BT Sport's coverage of this morning’s game in New Zealand as 'useless' and a 'complete disgrace', while another said: 'Well done the money men.' Scroll down for video . Tribute: Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew (left) and captain Fabricio Coloccini carry the wreaths . In memory: The programme cut to adverts as Pardew and Coloccini walked up the stand in tribute . The programme cut to adverts as Newcastle manager Alan Pardew and captain Fabricio Coloccini were walking up the stand at Forsyth Barr Stadium in Dunedin to place the tributes to the fans. This was followed by adverts for Birds Eye, SEAT, Strongbow, McDonald’s and Expedia - as well as a promotional clip for the channel’s coverage of an Arsenal v Manchester City match next month. Newcastle fan Ryan Brooks said on Twitter: 'BT Sport, [I] think it's awful and disrespectful you cut to adverts as they were laying wreaths in the stands - poor, poor on your front. And season ticket holder Daniel Goodall said: 'BT Sport - well done on cutting to adverts when flowers were getting placed, and managing to miss the majority of the minute’s silence. Disgrace.’ Bill Grieves added: ‘BT Sport - . would have been nice to have shown the full silence for the two . Newcastle fans rather than adverts. Fail.’ Remembered before the match: John Alder, 63, and Liam Sweeney, 28, were killed in the crash in Ukraine . Flowers: The tribute from Pardew and Coloccini came before Newcastle beat Sydney 4-0 in New Zealand . But a BT Sport spokesman told MailOnline . that the channel was sorry for what happened, saying: ‘We apologise for . any upset caused by a mistimed break during the Newcastle game. 'BT Sport - well done on cutting to adverts when flowers were getting placed, and managing to miss the majority of the minute's silence. Disgrace' Daniel Goodall, Newcastle fan . ‘The timing was unintentional, and we will show the tributes and the minute’s silence in full at the end of the game, as well as put all the footage online.’ This was later welcomed by Newcastle fans, with 'Yorkshire Sam' saying on Twitter: 'Good that BT Sport replayed the minute's silence at the end. They should never have cut to the adverts in the first place.' The channel also later posted on tweet linking a video of coverage of the tribute on its website. Emmanuel Riviere, a £5million summer signing from Monaco, marked his debut with a goal on 26 minutes as Newcastle cruised to a 4-0 victory over Sydney FC in the friendly. Minute's silence: Newcastle players pay tribute to their fans before the match begins . Rest in peace: Coloccini carries a wreath of flowers in memory of the fans prior to the game against Sydney . Before kick-off, Pardew and Coloccini laid wreaths on the seats which would have been occupied by Mr Alder and Mr Sweeney who died in the plane crash last Thursday while en route to New Zealand. The Magpies scored three times in 14 . first-half minutes as Siem de Jong took full advantage of goalkeeper . Ivan Necevski's 19th-minute error before Riviere and then Mapou . Yanga-Mbiwa struck. 'The timing was unintentional, and we will show the tributes and the minute’s silence in full at the end of the game, as well as put all the footage online' BT Sport spokesman . Newcastle keeper Rob Elliot had only one save to make to deny Corey Gameiro after the break, and substitute Adam Armstrong rounded off the scoring seven minutes from time. After the game, Pardew said of the fact the men's bodies have not yet been returned from Ukraine to their families: 'The after effects of the plane crash haven’t been great. 'They are having to suffer that as families and we are as fans too. The site has not been secured and the publicity around it hasn’t been great.' Pardew had earlier insisted that the forthcoming season would be dedicated to the two fans who died on the Malaysia Airlines flight. He said: ‘None of us would be sitting here without the fans. Reaction: BT Sport faced an angry backlash from Twitter after the 'mistimed break' ‘Owners and managers come and go, as do players, but the fans are always there, and these two guys in particular, to go to the lengths that they did to get out here, has brought home just how important supporters are to us. ‘Sometimes when you lose lives in that manner, it puts into context what we do. This season we want to give their families something to remember them by, by having a successful season.’ Pardew also thanked the Sunderland fans who put their usual rivalry to one side and have now raised more than £23,000 in tribute to Mr Sweeney and Mr Alder. ‘A lot is made of the rivalry between the two cities, and of course that is there,’ he said. ‘But I would like to thank all the Sunderland fans who have paid tribute and helped raise a staggering amount already. I am very proud of Sunderland Football Club for the way they have conducted themselves and I want to thank them.’ Newcastle faced Sydney FC in their opening fixture in the southern hemisphere, and Pardew had vowed to play a strong team to help honour the two fans.

"By . Mark Duell . Jailed: Former Tesco worker Heather Gibson was told by a judge that her actions had made it more difficult for real victims of rape to be believed in court . A mother has been jailed for four years after falsely claiming her boyfriend had raped her 14 times in a bid for revenge after their baby was taken into care. Former Tesco worker Heather Gibson, 29, of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, was told by a judge that her actions had made it more difficult for real victims of rape to be believed in court. Her former partner Gavin Plaistowe, 30, was held in police custody for 35 hours after she accused him of 12 rapes. Mr Plaistowe waited a month for police to investigate and find he was innocent. While on bail, Gibson claimed Morrisons worker Mr Plaistowe then raped her twice - while she awaited trial for perverting the course of justice. But CCTV of Gibson at work in the supermarket undermined her accounts. She alleged two gang rapes on two occasions - the last time with six men, Hull Crown Court was told yesterday. Mr Plaistowe could have been jailed for 20 years if the allegations had been true. But Gibson later confessed to a friend she blamed Mr Plaistowe for losing her child into care because she had made a complaint about him dropping the baby. Social Services took the baby into care for lack of parenting skills. Gibson, a former grammar school pupil, sought revenge with the false claims to the police. But when she was charged with perverting the course of justice, she forged a string of letters. They purported to be from officials including a crown court judge, a police officer, a justice minister and even Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Sentencing: Gibson pleaded guilty at Hull Crown Court (pictured) to four counts of doing an act tending to pervert the course of justice as specimens of her conduct . They were sent to Bath and North Somerset Social Services, where her daughter was in temporary residence. They claimed she had been the subject of wrongful allegations and expressed outrage she had been charged. They were all found to be produced by Gibson. She even took police to the spot of one of the alleged rapes, saying she had dragged by the hair and her bottom lip had been bitten. Gibson gave detailed accounts of each rape in video interview, but admitted she had showered after the attacks and lost all forensic evidence. She claimed to have details of contacts of witnesses in a cupcake-shaped notebook. However, the police recovered CCTV of her buying the notebook from a supermarket the day after she told them of its existence. The first rape she claimed happened when she was eight months pregnant by Mr Plaistowe. She said she was raped again after giving birth and on two occasions in April 2012 - first by Mr Plaistowe and four friends then by Mr Plaistowe and five others. He was arrested on April 4, 2012 and held in Grimsby Police Station from 12.20am until 6.26pm the following evening - a period of 18 hours. Such were the number of allegations he was re-arrested on April 26 2012 at 6.30am and released at 11.30pm after 17 hours. He did not know how seriously the police were treating the claims until May 4, 2012 - exactly one month later. Gibson pleaded guilty to four counts of doing an act tending to pervert the course of justice as specimens of her conduct. Simon Kealey, prosecuting, said two Humberside Police officers had spent eight weeks investigating the case. There had been two police interviews of Mr Plaistowe, three interviews of Gibson and a large amount of case preparation for a trial. Mr Kealey said it had diverted police attention and all this was in addition to the terror Mr Plaistow had suffered. He said Gibson would not get back her daughter. Jail: Gibson has since found a new boyfriend, is engaged - and the new man is visiting her in New Hall Prison (Pictured) in Flockton, West Yorkshire, cycling 174 miles in a round trip to see her, taking four days . In her pre-sentence report, Gibson showed no remorse. She said all her allegations were true, despite her guilty pleas - and that she had only pleaded guilty to get everything sorted quickly. Joanne Golding, defending, said Gibson had no mental health problems which could allow the judge to find a different sentencing option - although there were clearly issues. ‘It seems to me the catalyst of this was the taking of the baby into care,’ said Mrs Golding. ‘The consequences of this were catastrophic.What she alleged against Mr Plaistowe was actually impossible. However, I have to concede there was a degree of persistence and subterfuge.’ 'You have no right to deserve the sympathy given to those women. You have no place among their number. You make cases where women genuinely have been raped harder' Judge Graham Robinson . She admitted Gibson had since found a new boyfriend, was engaged - and he was visiting her in New Hall Prison in Flockton, West Yorkshire, cycling 174 miles in a round trip to see her, taking four days. She claimed she fell pregnant by him in January, before she was remanded in custody, although prison officials say a series of pregnancy tests are negative. Sentencing, Judge Graham Robinson told Gibson: ‘Allegations of rape and other sexual matters have to be treated seriously by the police. They have no option. To do otherwise would open them up to complaints. In this case it took two CID officers six to eight weeks to get to the bottom of the allegations. 'There were other uniform officers doing interviews. There were two medical examinations, but it goes beyond all that. When a woman cries rape it dishonours the genuine victims of rape. You have no right to deserve the sympathy given to those women. You have no place among their number. ‘The Lord Chief Justice said once the public realise there are women, such as you, who are prepared to make false allegations of rape, it causes juries, in cases of genuine rape, to think twice. ‘It can no longer be said that women will not lie about such things. You make cases where women genuinely have been raped harder. This was a serious case - Mr Plaistowe must have been terrified.’","Heather Gibson's ex-partner Gavin Plaistowe held in custody for 35 hours .

"By . Mark Duell . Two schoolboys who raped a girl aged just 10 avoided jail today because of their young age. The boys were just 12 and 13 when they carried out the sex attack on the younger girl while playing on an Xbox console, Newport Crown Court in South Wales was told. The girl kept it a secret for four months - until her mother caught her playing a game of dare with the same boys in woodland. No jail terms: Newport Crown Court in South Wales (pictured) was told that girl kept it a secret for four months - until her mother caught her playing a game of dare with the same boys in woodland . Judge Ian Murphy said: ‘Her parents have described their daughter as an empty shell and say her innocence was taken away from her.’ The court heard the two boys were playmates with the girl who lived nearby. They had been kicking a ball around when the weather became cold. The three friends then went inside to play computer games on an Xbox. But the older boy encouraged his younger friend to have sex with the girl and he later joined in. The boys, now both 14, denied rape but were found guilty at a trial last month. The judge ordered the boys to be electronically tagged for three months and put them under a 7pm to 7am curfew. Comments: Judge Ian Murphy (pictured) said the girl's parents had described their daughter as 'an empty shell' and say her 'innocence was taken away from her' He told them: ‘This is a very serious offence.

'You betrayed your friendship and you engaged in impulsive sexual exploration' Judge Ian Murphy . 'You betrayed your friendship and you engaged in impulsive sexual exploration. No force was used but she was only a little girl of 10.’ The court heard the girl was left damaged by the two older boys. The boys were given youth rehabilitation orders with intense supervision.

Greg and Jackie Tate of Gwinnett County were arrested on Friday after local police saw first-hand the conditions that their 15- and 17-year-old sons had to endure. ‘You could see just roaches and flies just all over the place when you're walking through the house,’ said Snellville Police Detective Orlando Concepcion.

"By . Dan Hyde . A rip-off that cheats pensioners of £1billion in vital income is to be investigated by watchdogs. It is thought that 400,000 people a year are being denied up to £50,000 throughout their retirement. Yesterday – following a campaign by Money Mail – the Financial Services Authority announced it had launched an investigation into the scandal. The worst affected are the sick, smokers and the terminally ill who are being short-changed by insurers. Industry figures show six in ten over-55s should qualify for bigger pensions due to poor health but just two in ten claim them. The probe centres around annuities, which many people live off when they retire. The FSA says pensioners are losing out because they are not told what they are entitled to. On retirement most people turn their savings into a regular income for life, by buying an annuity. What they receive each year depends largely on how long they are expected to live. The shorter someone’s life expectancy the more they should get because the ‘pension pot’ they have saved for all their life is being spread over a shorter period. Conversely a healthy person expected to live for many years would receive less because their ‘pot’ has to last much longer. Generally, those in poor health – a smoker or a diabetic – should get more. But they miss out because insurers encourage them to accept an average payout instead, which is usually meant for someone who is of perfect health. It means someone with a pot worth £100,000 would get a boost of £2,000 a year. This would be worth up to £50,000 over the course of a 25-year retirement. Industry figures show six in ten over-55s should qualify for bigger pensions due to poor health. But just two in ten people claim them. ‘The way pensioners are deprived of money they have spent their whole lives saving is an absolute scandal,’ said Ros Altmann, director-general of Saga. ‘There must be some obligation on these companies to treat their customers fairly and ensure they don’t spend their retirement in poverty.’ The National Association of Pension Funds estimates the scandal is depriving the elderly of an estimated £1billion a year in much needed income. Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, said: ‘Greater transparency in this market is essential if people are to have faith in pensions. ‘At the moment, consumers are dealing with an unfair and opaque system that is preventing too many of them from securing a decent income for their old age. People need to know that they can turn their savings pots into a good amount of income when they purchase an annuity.’ Also hit are widows who, in the most shocking cases, are left penniless because their husbands were convinced to sign up to a deal that died with them. This is because the standard incomes offered by insurers cover just a single person. When that individual dies, their pension dies with them. Married retirees can get an income which would keep paying money to their loved one when they die. Yet insurers again fail to make this clear. Every year thousands of women are left penniless because their husbands die before them and they have no pension of their own. The £1billion scandal is being compounded by huge falls in pensions caused by the Bank of England’s policy of printing more money, known as Quantitative Easing. Misleading pension deals have cost the elderly up to £1billion a year in lost income . This has caused rates on annuities to plunge by more than a fifth in three years, stripping £1,418 a year from a £100,000 pension. Last year, the Association of British Insurers announced it would launch a code of practice to ensure pensioners shopped around to get better incomes. But as part of its Get Britain Saving campaign Money Mail demanded an independent review by the Financial Services Authority after it exposed loopholes in the code. Yesterday, the watchdog announced it would probe the way pensioners took an income from their savings. Nick Poyntz-Wright, head of life insurance at the FSA, said: ‘An annuity purchase is an important one-off decision that has long term consequences for individuals if they get it wrong. ‘We want to understand the level of the potential detriment for consumers if they do not shop around, to see if there are ways to make this market work better for consumers.’ The results of the review will be published later this year. Billy Burrows, an independent financial adviser at Better Retirement Group, said: ‘Insurers are making improvements but there are still pockets of sharp practice and it’s right that the firms responsible come under closer scrutiny from the FSA.’ Stephen Gay, director of life, savings and protection, at the Association of British Insurers, said: ‘Any review of annuities would be timely. ‘The market is changing with ABI initiatives set to provide people approaching retirement with greater clarity and confidence as they prepare for retirement, and we are pleased that the FSA recognises this.’ Annuity rates are unlikely to rise for some time because the incoming governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has intimated he intends to carry on printing money, believing it to be the most effective way to kick start the economy out of a possible triple-dip recession.","Financial Services Authority to investigate insurance companies over misleading pension deals which deprive elderly of much-needed income .

"By . David Mccormack For Mailonline . A Comcast customer grew so frustrated with the poor service he received that he recorded his calls with the cable company and used them to prove that they lied to him about charges. The man, who declined to give his real name but calls himself ‘Tim Davis’ online, posted his exchanges on YouTube on Sunday and claims the company only refunded him $182 in unnecessary charges after he played them his recording of the exchanges. The incident came about after Tim moved to a new apartment in Eugene, Oregon, a month ago and installed his modem and set up his Wi-Fi himself. Scroll down for video . A Comcast customer, calling himself 'Tim Davis', grew so frustrated with the poor service he received that he recorded his calls with the cable company and used them to prove that they lied to him about charges . The problem started when Tim checked his next bill and found that he had been charged $132 for failing to install his modem properly. Something which had never been an issue . Not long after, his internet connection began to stop working for 5 to 10 minutes at a time and so he called Comcast to complain. Together, Tim and the representative figured out that the problem was caused by the cable outside of the apartment and that it wasn't his fault. Based on his previous experience with the cable company, Tim asked the representative to confirm wouldn't be charged for the repair. This assurance was captured on tape. A Comcast technician then visited the building where Tim lives and fixed the problem. The problem started when Tim checked his . next bill and found that he had been charged $132 for failing to install . his modem properly. Something which had never been an issue. On top of that, Tim was also he was charged another $50 for having Comcast set up his Wi-Fi network - again something that Tim had already done himself. When he called Comcast to query the charges, Tim was put on hold for an hour before he hung up. Eventually he spoke with a rep called Daisy who informed him that Comcast had subtracted $100 from his bill for 'service discounts.' Despite his bill being more than halved, Tim said he was still unhappy about the charges. Next, he was offered an upgrade to a faster internet service. The offer was worth less than the $82 that Comcast was still asking Tim to pay and so he said no. Next, Daisy told him that there was simply no way she could remove the charges or reimburse his account. Tim then revealed that he had a recording of a phone call in which Comcast told him he wouldn't be charged. Finally, Comcast backed down and gave him back his money. 'Why were you not able to do that before?' Tim asked. When Tim spoke to a rep at Comcast he was told him that there was simply no way they could remove the charges or reimburse his account (stock image of Comcast call center) Taking the blame: An internal memo from Comcast COO Dave Watson blames the company for training customer service reps in potentially annoying tactics . 'Again, . that is a valid charge,' Daisy said. 'But since I advised my manager . that there is a recording, and you were misinformed, then he's the one . who can approve that $82.' 'You're telling me that if I didn't have a recording of that call, you wouldn't have been able to do it,' he said. 'That is correct, yes.' Tim, who works as a senior IT analyst for a large company, posted about his experience with Comcast on Reddit and received a deluge of people with similar experiences. Last . month, Comcast made headlines after another customer recorded and . published a phone call with customer service. In that call, a Comcast . rep refused to let a couple cancel their service when they wanted to . switch cable and Internet providers. A . leaked memo reveals that high-ranking executives at Comcast admit the . excruciating customer service call that recently went viral was mostly . their fault. The company's chief operating officer Dave Watson says in his memo that the nagging, begging and condescending endured for 18 minutes by Ryan Block was part of what Comcast paid and trained the employee to do. 'It was painful to listen to this call, and I am not surprised that we have been criticized for it,' Watson says in the document first leaked to Consumerist. The memo . surfaced just a week after the call to Engadget founder Ryan Block--who . recorded it and put it on Soundcloud, where it's now been played over 5 . million times--went viral. 'We . are embarrassed by the tone of the call and the lack of sensitivity to . the customer’s desire to discontinue service,' Watson wrote. Comcast is currently seeking regulatory . approval to buy Time Warner Cable for $45 billion, a deal that would . make the largest cable company in the world even bigger.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Charlotte Jowett is devastated after a thief stole her handbag containing pictures of her critically-ill baby daughter . A devastated mother's online plea for help after a thief stole precious photographs of her critically ill baby daughter has gone viral. Charlotte Jowett, 22, was heartbroken when she discovered hundreds of photographs of her 12-week-old daughter Olivia had been stolen - on the morning she was rushed into theatre for emergency surgery. Ms Jowett accidentally left her bag in the canteen at Manchester Children’s Hospital a fortnight ago. Despite being left unattended for just a few minutes, the bag had gone when she returned to retrieve it. Inside the bag was her mobile phone, containing images of her daughter’s progress since being admitted to hospital 10 weeks previously. Since posting an emotional appeal on Facebook, her words have been shared more than 100,000 times by social network users, who have branded the theft as 'despicable' and 'disgusting'. Ms Jowett, from Wigan, Greater Manchester, posted: 'To the person who has stolen my bag from the hospital, if you see this, please can you hang my bag to security? 'You can keep my watch, the money - I just want the bag back, and the pictures of my critically poorly daughter who is only ten weeks old. 'Please can people share this and maybe someone will see it.' She said the photographs, which have documented Olivia’s progress since being in intensive care, are 'irreplaceable' - especially as they contained the the  very first family photograph. Ms Jowett said: 'We’ve lost hundreds of photographs and they were all very special to me. 'We very nearly lost Olivia so I’m always taking pictures on my phone trying to capture as many moments as I can. 'But one of the most precious to me was our very first family photograph. 'It was taken when Olivia was just a few hours old, before we knew about her condition and before she was rushed into hospital.  That’s been stolen and we can never replace it.' She added that after Olivia was admitted, the large doses of medication she was on meant she slept for weeks. 'We took a picture of the very first time she opened her eyes after she was taken in and we’ve lost that too. Inside Ms Jowett's bag was her mobile phone, containing images of her daughter Olivia's progress since being admitted to hospital 10 weeks ago . Since posting an emotional appeal on Facebook, ,Ms Jowett's words have been shared more than 100,000 times by social network users, who have branded the theft 'despicable' and 'disgusting' 'Another photograph that was really special to me was a picture of her in an incubator when she was in intensive care. She was so tiny and had this little hat on - she looked so sweet. 'I can’t explain how much they mean to us,' she added. 'We almost lost Olivia and she has come such a long way since then - the pictures show just how far. I’m begging whoever has them to hand them in. 'I won’t be mad - I just want the photos back. They can do it anonymously and I won’t try and track them down. 'I really hope Olivia’s story appeals to their conscience. It’s an awful thing to have done. 'I’d been crying in the canteen that morning because Olivia had been rushed in and I hadn’t been thinking straight. 'I’m . punching myself now for leaving my bag. Whoever took it has stooped . very low - it’s a children’s hospital and nobody wants to be there. 'It’s . hard for everyone and so many families are going through such a tough . time. I can’t believe someone would steal from a place like that.' Baby Olivia has been fighting for her life due . to intestinal problems. Her mother now only has a handful of photos of . her early days (pictured), donated by friends and family . 'I’m normally a really positive person and look for the best in people but this has really shaken me.' Baby Olivia was kept in hospital after suffering from intestinal problems following her birth in May. And two weeks after her birth, she went grey and started vomiting, so was rushed into emergency surgery where doctors battled to save her life. Her mother said: 'She wasn’t herself and she’d stopped eating. Then, all of sudden she lost all her colour and started vomiting faeces so we rushed her to hospital. Ms Jowett (pictured with partner Nathan Lund) is now begging for the phone with the pictures to be returned, with no ramifications . 'She was taken straight into surgery and doctors said had it been half an hour later, she wouldn’t have survived.' Investigations revealed that when Olivia was born, the blood vessels to her intestines hadn’t formed properly. 'Instead, they had formed a growth which turned toxic and killed her intestine,' said Ms Jowett. 'She was in intensive care for a week and has had five operations, but now doctors are hoping she can be home by the end of September. 'Her intestine has been removed and she now has short bowel syndrome, which means she will always have to be on a special diet, but hopefully she will be OK.' A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'We are investigating a case of a woman’s phone being stolen from Manchester Children’s Hospital. 'She left her bag in the canteen and when she returned it was gone. 'We are currently awaiting CCTV images from the hospital for further investigation.' A Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS foundation trust spokesman said: 'We regret any distress caused and are sorry to hear of this incident. 'We encourage patients and visitors to keep their property safe and attended at all times. 'We would urge the person who may have possession of these highly sentimental photos to return them.'","Charlotte Jowett's daughter Olivia is in Manchester Children's Hospital .

The individual has been 'voluntarily' confined at home for the past week after returning from an infected country in West Africa and fearing they could have been exposed to the deadly disease . Medical experts are in daily telephone contact with the person in case they start to show symptoms of the deadly disease. Ebola is a . severe acute viral illness often characterised by the sudden onset of . fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. In its . early stages its symptoms can often be confused with a cold or flu. But . with Ebola, other symptoms emerge which include vomiting, diarrhoea, . rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both . internal and external bleeding. The maximum period the virus usually incubates before symptoms emerge is 21 days - and people cannot be tested before the onset of symptoms. Anna Humphries, of Public Health Wales, said the individual told doctors they 'may have been exposed' to the deadly virus which has so far killed 826 people across Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Guinea. She told MailOnline: 'We don't have a case of Ebola at the moment. We have an individual who has travelled in the West Africa region where the outbreak is. 'Upon returning to Wales a week ago, the individual realised they may have been in contact with people with Ebola, although the risk is minimal. 'The person is voluntarily staying at home and away from work for 21 days.' Fears that Ebola may reach Britain intensified on Sunday night after a passenger from a flight which stopped in Sierra Leone died at Gatwick airport. The 72-year-old woman became ill and collapsed after she left a Gambia Bird jet arriving from the West African country, but tests later revealed she did not have the disease . She added that Public Health England is in daily contact to monitor the individual, who is currently showing no symptoms and 'seems well'. 'As a result, there is no case - and no suspected case and 'no risk to the public' posed by the quarantined traveller,' she said. 'They don't have symptoms at the moment. This is someone who may have been exposed to Ebola and we are keeping an eye on them. 'The . reason we haven't spoken about this before is the individual is not . currently a case of Ebola. There are dozens of these suspected cases all . over the UK at the moment.' 'We are in daily contact with them and at the moment they are feeling well. If symptoms arise then we will act. British Airways has suspended flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone until the end of August over concerns about the Ebola outbreak. The carrier normally operates a four-times-a-week service from Heathrow to Freetown in Sierra Leone, with a connection on to Monrovia in Liberia. BA said: 'We have temporarily suspended our flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until August 31 2014 due to the deteriorating public health situation in both countries. 'The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will keep the routes under constant review in the coming weeks. 'Customers with tickets on those routes are being offered a range of options including a full refund and the ability to rebook their flights to a later date.' 'The first symptom is usually a high temperature and they could get that for a number of reasons - with a cold or the flu - but as an absolute precaution they would be taken to their nearest hospital for tests. 'In the event that happens it would be the first case of Ebola in the UK - that would be a fairly big deal.' Public Health Wales said good hygiene is the most effective way of stopping the virus spreading. Fears that Ebola may reach Britain intensified on Sunday night after a passenger from a flight which stopped in Sierra Leone died at Gatwick airport. The 72-year-old woman became ill and collapsed after she left a Gambia Bird jet arriving from the West African country, but tests later revealed she did not have the disease. The British centre of excellence for treating the Ebola virus is the Royal Free Hospital in London and is where any infected person would eventually be taken in the event of an outbreak. A statement released today by Public Health Wales said: 'Public Health Wales can confirm that an individual resident in Wales is currently staying away from work and limiting contact with other people voluntarily following possible exposure to Ebola while visiting Western Africa. 'The individual does not have symptoms of Ebola and there are no cases of Ebola in Wales. 'We are alert to the possibility of Ebola cases in the UK given the outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea and we remain vigilant to unexplained illness in people who have traveled from the area. 'Processes have been developed to protect public health in the event that we are notified of any individual who may have been exposed to Ebola.' What is Ebola virus disease? Ebola . is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per . cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, . gorillas and chimpanzees. How do people become infected with the virus? Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In . Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with . chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and . porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. Once . a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a . sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also . become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled . clothing, bed linen or used needles. Men . who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to . their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery. Ebola is a severe, often fatal disease, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent . Who is most at risk? Those at risk during an outbreak include: . What are the typical signs and symptoms? Sudden . onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore . throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney . and liver function and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms. When should you seek medical care? If . a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact . with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek . medical help immediately. What is the treatment? Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them. But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care.Can Ebola be prevented? Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use. Is it safe to travel to affected areas? The World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.Source: World Health Organisation .","The potential victim, thought to be in Cardiff, is being 'closely monitored'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . For most toddlers, the odd sweet is a treat. But for Evan Grimes, just one mouthful of the wrong food could be deadly. Evan, from Baltimore, Maryland, is so allergic to everything he comes into contact with he has to wear mittens to stop him from scratching the painful hives which he battles on a daily basis. If fed citric acid, a common food additive found in soft drinks and sweets, or bread, the toddler could face losing his sight permanently or even death if he didn't have his EpiPen. Evan Grimes, with mother Tonya, has so many allergies that he can only eat 11 foods . Evan, now 18 months, suffers such bad reactions to certain foods that he scratches his skin raw . And to prevent the long list of other dangerous allergies from flaring up, Evan is only allowed to eat just 11 'safe' foods. His mother Toya, 28, first noticed her son's allergies when he was just two months old after the skin around his eyes became severely infected. Doctors prescribed steroids to try and calm down the reactions, but Evan continued to suffer painful breakouts which would leave the skin on his face raw and paper thin. Mrs Grimes said: 'When he first started showing signs of allergies, I would put little baby mittens on him so he wouldn't scratch. 'But he would itch so bad he would use the entire mitten to rub his face raw. 'I didn't have a clue what foods he was allergic to, so he would itch and scratch all night until he bled. 'By the time we got up in the morning it looked as if someone had been murdered in the bed.' A dermatologist suggested that Evan might be allergic to citric acid, as the attacks seemed to coincide. But even . after another serious breakout of hives, Mrs Grimes claims aims that . doctors refused to give Evan an allergy test, saying he was too young. Dust . mites, cats, dogs, cockroaches, barley, malt, oats, rye, soybean, . wheat, white potato, dairy, bacon, sausages, shrimp, salmon, egg, . peanut, walnut, coconut, lemon, beef, chicken, clams, corn, rice, . sweets, sweet potato, lettuce, tomato, onion, pecan, papaya, lime, . orange, cherry, peach, strawberry, banana, avocado, mango, kiwi, . grapefruit, chilli, pepper, melon. She said: 'I told them he was suffering, screaming, crying and bleeding every day, but they wouldn't listen. 'That is too much for a baby to go through and by this point, I felt totally hopeless. There was nothing I could do.' But by the time Evan was 15 months old, she had managed to book an appointment with a skin specialist. 'She cried when she saw Evan and immediately approved him for a blood test,' Mrs Grines said. Evan . tested positive for 46 allergies, including citric acid, potatoes, . nuts, wheat and dairy and was referred to a paediatrician, a . dermatologist, an allergist and a nutritionist to help keep his . allergies at bay. Mrs Grimes said: 'It has been a horror story from the beginning until he was tested for allergies. 'Since then, I've been worrying non-stop and making sure I monitor closely what he's exposed to. 'I'm just terrified he'll get a hold of something he shouldn't.' The toddler's mother first noticed her son's allergies when he was just two months old after the skin around his eyes became severely infected . Evan's strict diet now consists of just 11 items: Turkey, string beans, carrots, apples, grapes, pears, greens, kale, beetroot, broccoli, and allergen-free cereal . Over the past few months, she has finally identified a narrow list of low-reaction foods which are safe for her son to eat. His strict diet now consists of just 11 items: Turkey, string beans, carrots, apples, grapes, pears, greens, kale, beetroot, broccoli, and allergen-free cereal. However Evan, now 18 months, still has extremely sensitive skin and must be near an EpiPen at all times in case he suffers a reaction. His mother said: 'Things have got better, but something as simple as a soft drink could leave him blinded for life. 'Evan's actually very good about not eating things he's allergic to but it's difficult to keep an eye on him all the time. 'I couldn't even count the number of times I've had to tell people he's not allowed to eat candy or cookies. 'But he doesn't let it get him down though, he's always smiling. It's a massive challenge but I'm certain we will be able to battle through it together.'","Evan Grimes has such severe allergies he scratches his skin raw .

"By . James Chapman . The coalition is overseeing the biggest reduction in Britain’s vast public sector workforce for half a century, and will have slashed one in five jobs by the time austerity is due to come to an end, a report says today. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says employment by the state will fall by 1.1 million, or 19 per cent, by 2018-19 compared with when George Osborne entered the Treasury in 2010. But in a significant endorsement of the Government’s plan to rebalance the economy in favour of the private sector, it concludes that a ‘buoyant’ jobs market means that thus far firms in in every region have created more positions than public employment has fallen. The share of the workforce employment by the state is already at its lowest level for at least 40 years, with 5.4 million employees or just under 20 per cent, the IFS says. Further planned cuts will mean the figure falling to just 14.8 per cent, a ‘dramatic change’ in the nature of the UK labour market. When Labour lost the 2010 general election, the public sector employed about 6.1 million workers, with their pay bill accounting for well over half of day-to-day Government spending. Critics accuse Gordon Brown of seeking to create a ‘client’ state, with more and more people dependent on the Government for employment or benefits. Today’s report says if the forecast of a 1.1 million fall in public sector employment by 2018-19 is delivered, it  would dwarf the fall of 350,000 seen in the 1990s and more than undo the increase of over 600,000 seen under Labour during the 2000s. However, it warns of significant challenges to the Government’s plans – saying savage cutbacks in other areas will be required if it maintains existing protections for the NHS and schools. Already 57 per cent of public sector workers are employed in these two sectors, up from 42 per cent in 1991. This proportion could reach over 70 per cent by 2018 if education and health continue to protected from future workforce cuts. The report says delivering the planned cuts without reducing the numbers working in health and education will be ‘very challenging’. If there continue to be reductions to the education and NHS workforces between now and 2018, the rest of the government workforce will have to shrink by  40 per cent, from 2.2 to 1.3 million. Even if the education and the NHS workforces were reduced by 200,000 over the next five years - a fall of six per cent -  the reductions in other areas of general government employment would still need to be about 30 per cent. The report also says that women now make up two-thirds of the public sector workforce, a proportion which will continue to grow -  mainly since women are more likely than men to work in areas where the budget is being protected from cuts, such as health and education. It also reveals a dramatic variation in the dependence of different regions and countries of the UK on the public sector for jobs. If there continue to be reductions to the education and NHS workforces between now and 2018, the rest of the government workforce will have to shrink by  40 per cent, from 2.2 to 1.3 million. In inner London, 23 per cent of people are employed by the state, compared to 34 per cent in Merseyside and 36 per cent in Tyne and Wear. The public sector workforce is also still dominant in areas of rural Wales and Scotland, and the smallest in areas of rural England and the M4 corridor. Jonathan Cribb, research economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: ‘The public sector workforce grew by over 600,000 over the 2000s. 'Even so the scale of the reductions expected over the next few years looks challenging. If delivered, the 1.1 million drop in general government employment… between 2010–11 and 2018–19 would be almost three times larger than the previous drop during the early 1990s. ‘The workforce is a useful prism through which to look at the effects of cutting total spending whilst protecting the NHS and schools budgets from cuts. 'With limited falls in the health and education workforces the number of public sector workers in other areas could fall by 30-40% over the next five years.’","Institute for Fiscal Studies says from 2010-19 state jobs will fall by 19% .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Brave: Stephanie Brown suffers from a rare skin condition which means any form of anxiety can lead to her breaking out in large spots . For most schoolchildren, slipping up in the playground can cause the odd graze and a bit of embarrassment. But for Stephanie Brown, any form of anxiety could trigger a head-to-toe rash - and leave her entire body covered in scabs. The six-year-old suffers from an extremely rare skin condition called Diffuse Cutaneous Mastocytosis (DCM). Any form of emotional or environmental stress triggers a flare up, causing thickening of the skin and blistering. In the past, the only part of her body that hasn't been affected is the tip of her nose. Stephanie's condition is so extreme that people often stop and stare at her in the street during a flare-up. Her mother Maria, 42, said: 'If she's anxious or gets upset, or even if it's just too cold, she comes out in big red blotches. 'Within seconds, her whole body is covered in big pinky brown coloured spots, and they won't go away until she calms down. 'It's events that trigger it, so if she falls over in the supermarket or if someone says something she's not sure about. 'Only the other day, one of her friends asked her to come and play. But because she didn't know what to say, it sparked a break out.' 'Depending on the flare up, I will give her antihistamines, but generally a cuddle with her mum will help her to calm down.' Stephanie's condition is caused by her body producing too many 'mast cells'. These are blood cells formed in the bone marrow to help fight off infection and illness. Mrs Brown, a learning mentor, and her husband Nigel, 40, a lorry driver, first noticed something was wrong when Stephanie was born. Battle: Stephanie as a baby. Her condition, called Diffuse Cutaneous Mastocytosis (DCM),  means any form of emotional or environmental stress trigger a flare up . Anxiety: 'Within seconds, her whole body is covered in big pinky brown coloured spots, and they won't go away until she calms down,' says Stephanie's mother, Maria . 'We spotted a hive on the middle finger . of her right hand,' said Mrs Brown. 'We asked the midwife about it but . she said it was nothing - it was quite common and her skin just had to . get used to the environment.' Over the next few months the couple were given yet more reasons, such as a clothing or dog allergy. In the end, Mrs Brown was so desperate for a diagnosis she took Stephanie to Dewsbury and District Hospital, near the family home in Mirfield, West Yorkshire and pleaded with doctors to help. 'By sheer luck there was a dermatologist there and he recognised it as a form of mastocytosis,' she said. Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis is an extremely rare condition. It is caused by the accumulation of mast cells in the skin. These cells contain substances, such as histamine, that regulate allergic reactions. The condition is usually found in children and typically resolves itself by puberty. It causes thickening of the skin and agonising blisters. There is no cure but treatment helps most patients. Typical treatments include taking antihistamines to prevent the effect of mast cell histamine. Source: Genetic and Rare Disease Information Centre . Stephanie's official diagnosis of DCM came the following month after she was referred to a clinic in Newcastle, Tyne and Wear. Despite their daughter being only one of three children in the country with the condition at the time, Stephanie's parents say they were relieved to finally have a diagnosis for her. Mrs Brown said: 'When it all started and no one could tell me what the real problem was, I did a lot of my own research on the internet. 'After about two weeks I was pretty certain it was DCM. It affects 1 in 500,000 people in the UK but Stephanie suffers with a rare strain of it - which meant it was harder to diagnose.' Stephanie, whose two-year-old sister Gracie does not have the condition, is said to be the first infant in the UK to undergo a pioneering course of 'sun bed' treatment to blitz the disease, where she was showered in bursts of ultra-violet light. While the treatment has dramatically improved her skin condition, she still has behavioural swings and phobias as a result of the condition, her mother says. 'Some days it will cause her to just run away and hide - but other days she copes well with it. 'She even shames people in the street who gawp at her by shouting ""What's that lady looking at, mummy?""' 'I tell her, ""she's looking at you because you're so beautiful.""' The six-year-old was told by a doctor that the rash would have a drawback, however. Discussing her future, Mrs Brown claims the doctor told her daughter: 'It won't stop her doing anything she wants to do - unless she wants to be a model.' Recovery: Since having treatment with UV light, Stephanie (left with Maria, her mother and Gracie, her sister) has shown an improvement. Many children grow out of the condition by the time they are teenagers . But the comment upset Stephanie and her family, who have always encouraged her that her condition is nothing to be ashamed of. Mrs Brown said: 'As a first time mum to a little girl, I was devastated to hear these words. 'I would love her to get a shot at modelling. Not a career, just a one-off thing, so that we could say ""well actually she is"".' There is an 80 per cent chance that Stephanie will grow out of the condition by her teenage years, but either way, her mother hopes the condition won't hold her back from anything. She added: 'It's not just a condition, it's a place - and in the early days it was a really dark place. 'We've come so far, and we want people to know about the condition, so that those who suffer from it are treated no differently to anyone else. 'The condition itself has been easier than the prejudice we have had to face.'","Stephanie Brown has a skin condition called Diffuse Cutaneous Mastocytosis .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Stress produces a chemical alteration to a gene called SKA2 - and people with suicidal tendencies also have depleted levels of this gene . A new blood test for spotting suicide has been developed by a scientists. Scientists have discovered stress produces a chemical alteration to a gene called SKA2 and people with suicidal tendencies also have lower levels of the gene. Picking up on this change could make it possible for doctors to predict a person’s risk of suicide using a simple blood test - and monitor people most likely to harm themselves. The SKA2 gene is expressed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - an area involved in inhibiting negative thoughts and controlling impulsive behaviour. It 'chaperones' stress hormones into a cell’s nucleus so that they can work to suppress stress levels. Yet if there are not enough SKA2 or it is altered, the stress hormone receptor cannot suppress the release of the 'stress hormone' cortisol in the brain  - leading to suicidal thoughts. Professor Zachary Kaminsky, from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said: 'Suicide is a major preventable public health problem. 'But we have been stymied in our prevention efforts because we have no consistent way to predict those who are at increased risk of killing themselves. 'With a test like ours, we may be able to stem suicide rates by identifying those people and intervening early enough to head off a catastrophe.' Researchers looked at mutations in the gene SKA2 in brain samples from mentally ill people who had died from suicide - and then compared them with healthy individuals. They discovered levels of SKA2 were significantly lower in people who had killed themselves. And that within this common mutation, there was a modification that changed the way this gene functioned. The modification added chemicals called methyl groups to the gene. Blood tests revealed there were higher levels of methylation in the SKA2 gene for people with a record of suicidal thoughts or attempts. The researchers then designed a model to . predict which of the participants were experiencing suicidal thoughts - . or had attempted suicide with 80 per cent certainty. The SKA2 gene is expressed in the prefrontal cortex of the brain - an area involved in inhibiting negative thoughts and controlling impulsive behaviour . Those with more severe risk of suicide were predicted with 90 per cent accuracy. In younger people, blood tests enabled scientists to predict whether a person had attempted suicide with 96 per cent accuracy. Professor  Kaminsky said: 'We have found a gene that we think could be really important for consistently identifying a range of behaviours from suicidal thoughts to attempts to completions. 'We need to study this in a larger sample but we believe that we might be able to monitor the blood to identify those at risk of suicide.' The research was published in The American Journal of Psychiatry.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Drugs used to treat HIV could be used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS), new research suggests. Researchers found that people infected with HIV infection have a significantly lower risk of developing the debilitating nerve condition. They say chronic dampening down of the immune system as a result of HIV - or the antiretroviral drugs used to treat -  it could be the reason behind the lowered risk. Multiple sclerosis - caused by the body's own defences attacking myelin, the fatty insulation surrounding nerve fibres (pictured) - could be treated with HIV drugs, new research suggests . The MS Society said that while much more research is needed into the subject, the study shows that that antiretrovirals could be a potential future option for treatment for MS. The condition is caused by the body’s own defences attacking myelin, the fatty insulation surrounding nerve fibres. As myelin is stripped away, nerve impulses can no longer be transmitted properly leading to symptoms ranging from mild tingling to full-blown paralysis. The condition can cause attacks or relapses that may lead to progressive loss of physical skills, sensation, vision, bladder control, and intellectual abilities. Drugs that dampen the immune system can slow early forms of the disease, but little can be done for patients in the later stages. Antiretroviral medications (pictured) - may be one reason why HIV patients are less likely to develop MS . In the new study, researchers from Queen Mary University of London, the University of Oxford and the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, Australia, examined more than 21,000 HIV-positive patients treated in hospitals in England between 1999 and 2011. They then compared them to more than five million control subjects. Their study, published in the Journal Of Neurology Neurosurgery And Psychiatry, found that those with HIV were 62 per cent less likely to develop MS than the controls. The authors wrote: 'HIV infection is associated with a significantly decreased risk of developing MS. 'Mechanisms of this observed possibly protective association may include immunosuppression induced by chronic HIV infection and antiretroviral medications.' Commenting on the study, Dr Emma Gray, research communications manager at the MS Society, said: 'This is a valuable and intriguing new study, and the first to show a significant link between HIV and a reduced risk of MS. 'Much more research is needed to definitively prove whether having HIV or being treated for HIV with antiretrovirals - or even a combination of the two - reduces the risk of someone developing MS. 'We know that people with MS want new, effective treatments and this study provides some encouragement that antiretrovirals could be a potential future option. She added: 'Clinical trials are the only way to determine this and the good news is there is a London-based trial ongoing which is aimed at testing one such drug.'","In MS, body's immune system destroying nerves and their protective coating .

Blake Beckford was preparing to compete in a bodybuilding competition when he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. The painful condition causes inflammation and . ulceration of the inner lining of the rectum and colon, triggering symptoms such as diarrhoea and stomach cramps. Scroll down for video . Blake Beckford suffers from ulcerative colitis. The painful condition led him to having his colon removed and being fitted with a colostomy bag but he has now become a fitness model . Doctors warned the father-of-one after surgery that he would never be able to train at the level required to be a fitness model - but he decided to try anyway . Over the next decade, the devastated 33-year-old was treated with a variety of drugs. But his condition meant he was constantly tired - and needing to go to the loo up to 20 times a day. He was also forced to give up his strict training regime - which had included two-hour gym sessions, six days a week - and lost two stone in weight as his muscle wasted away. By last October, his health had deteriorated so much that he required surgery. Mr Beckford was admitted to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for a sub-total colectomy. This involved removing his entire colon before doctors performed an ileostomy  - where the small intestine is diverted through an opening in the abdomen. He was fitted with a stoma bag on the outside of his body to collect waste. Doctors also warned the father-of-one he would never be able to train at the level required to be a fitness model. He said: 'They said to start lifting weights and training to be a physique model would be very unattainable and unlikely. 'I was warned there was a risk of hernias and other problems.' But determined to prove them wrong, he began a training regime in January, starting at a weight of 11st 12lbs. Over the last six months he has bulked up to 13st 2lbs and has just appeared in ‘Men’s Fitness’ magazine. And now a personal trainer, he hopes his progress will inspire others with stoma bags to have more confidence. He now plans to enter his first competition in the physique class of the Miami Pro UK Championships in October this year . Mr Beckford after surgery last October. He said: 'When I came out of hospital, I had to get used to having a stoma. 'I knew it was there,  but found it hard to accept the fact I had this bag on my stomach and what it did' Ulcerative . Colitis (UC) is a condition that causes inflammation and ulceration of the . inner lining of the rectum and colon (the large bowel). In UC, tiny . ulcers develop on the surface of the lining and these may bleed and . produce pus. The inflamed colon is less able to absorb liquid and . this can lead to a larger volume of watery stools. Also, because the . colon cannot hold as much as usual, sufferers may have very frequent . bowel movements (six or more a day). It’s estimated that Ulcerative Colitis affects about one in every 420 people in the UK. Viruses, . bacteria, diet and stress have all been suggested as environmental . triggers, but there is no definite evidence that any one of these . factors is the cause of UC. Mr Beckford, who lives with his girlfriend in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, said: 'I am determined to show people and society that having a stoma doesn’t change who you are. 'It . doesn’t mean you’re not normal. You can achieve anything you . want to do, you can be attractive, and you can lead a normal life.' He admits that it took some time to get used to his new appearance. 'When I came out of hospital, I had to get used to having a stoma,' he said. 'I knew it was there, but found it hard to accept the fact I had this bag on my stomach and what it did. 'It was strange because I didn’t even want to show my family at first. 'It took a while to build my confidence again, to talk to people openly about having a stoma, to show anyone what I had. 'But over time I realised ""this is me"". 'The operation had also made me feel like a new person. My energy levels were much better and I could enjoy life more.' He now plans to enter his first competition in the physique class of the Miami Pro UK Championships in October this year. He added: 'After the surgery I remember thinking if I would be happy even if I could just potter around the garden or spend time with my friends and family. 'I never thought I would be able to get in this shape and be competing for the first time.'","Blake Beckford, 33, was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2003 .

Her devastated husband Lee, 26, said: 'Caroline was so excited at being pregnant but she never got to see our baby. 'But I will make sure I bring her up just as she would have wanted - with a great love of life. 'I will . tell Haillie-Rose what a beautiful person her mother was.

Eight . years ago she was told she would never walk again after breaking her . back in a car accident - but again proved the doctors wrong. Doctors carried out an emergency Caesarean to deliver Haillie-Rose two months ago, but her mother never regained consciousness . After meeting her husband Lee, she was given the all-clear by doctors to have a baby - but was warned there was only a slight chance of her conceiving due to cysts on her ovaries. Upon learning they would be parents after all, the couple  picked the baby's name and decorated the nursery in pink, lemon and white, ready for her arrival. Mr Howarth said: 'We were so looking forward to becoming parents.It breaks my heart that she never got the chance to cuddle up with Haillie-Rose. 'But I will give her loads of cuddles and tell our little girl about her mum and all the bits of the films we used to watch that made her laugh.' He says . turning off his wife's life support machine as she lay in the Royal . Gwent Hospital in Newport was the hardest moment of his life. 'At . first I couldn't grasp that I was really losing her. I told the doctors . I wanted to keep Caroline on the machines forever until she woke up.

Hallie-Rose, who is now two months old is being brought up by Lee and Caroline's family in Pontypool. Caroline's mother, Marilyn Brooks, said: 'Even though this has happened Caroline would be over the moon to see that her daughter has had a better start in life than she had herself.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Former TOWIE star Sam Faiers says she has overhauled her diet since her shock diagnosis of Crohn's disease earlier this year. The 23-year-old's weight plummeted to just over 7st by the time she left the Celebrity Big Brother house in February. Just five days into the show, she was hit by horrific stomach . cramps within minutes of eating or drinking anything, which led to being . sick or bouts of diarrhoea. Scroll down for video . Healthier: Six months on from her Crohn's diagnosis, Sam says she's back in good health. She is now helping to raise awareness of the condition . 'My body was just shutting down because there was just nothing inside me - I couldn't keep anything down, not even water,' she told MailOnline. Two weeks after she left, she was given the devastating diagnosis that she had the chronic, incurable digestive condition. 'My . family had tried to stay positive, and said it might just be a tummy . bug, but I knew it was something more - you know your own body. 'Even when I was . diagnosed, I didn't want to make a fuss. I just wanted to concentrate on . getting back to normal. I'm . quite strong - I'm not an ""ill"" person.' Now, six months on, having got to grips with her diagnosis, she says she feels better than ever. And the main reason? Adjusting her diet. 'I've learned that even after a couple of glasses of wine, I feel really rough the next day,' she told MailOnline. 'I don't know why - it might be because wine is so acidic. 'Now I'll just have a G&T - and I definitely drink less than I used to.' Avoiding foods that are high in acid - such as wine and tomatoes - plus curries and fried foods, are key to preventing a flare-up, she says. Unaware: Sam going into the Celebrity Big Brother house, where she fell ill. Six months on, having got to grips with her diagnosis, she says she feels better than ever . Dangerously thin: The 23-year-old's weight plummeted to 71/2 stone by the time she left the Celebrity Big Brother house in February . Undiagnosed: 'In the house my body was just shutting down because there was just nothing inside me - I couldn't keep anything down, not even water,' she told MailOnline . 'I also can't eat popcorn - it really affects me, which is a shame as I used to really love it.' High-fibre foods such as cereals are also off the menu. Instead Sam, who now weighs just under 9st, follows a simple, healthy diet. 'Last summer I was single and on a lot of girlie holidays. This year, I've been more sensible, although I still love my food,' she says. 'I'm cutting out carbs where I can, but I need to keep my energy up, eating little and often.' Breakfast, she says, is either porridge or poached eggs on granary bread, followed by a snack of fruit mid-morning. Lunch will be a salad or a wrap with chicken or tuna, followed by a light dinner. 'I try not to have anything too big - and eat before 8pm.' says Sam. 'My trainer says it really helps to stay lean and toned.' Sam has is now supporting this year's Gut Week, which runs from August 11-17. The awareness week is part of Love Your Gut, an ongoing campaign which serves to . highlight the vital role of the digestive system and emphasise the . importance of maintaining good gut health. Sam . said: 'I'm really excited to be part of Love Your Gut. My Crohn’s . disease has had a huge effect on my life and has shown me how vital . looking after your health is. 'I want to continue raising awareness and help other people deal with their condition like me, with confidence.

Proactive: Sam continues to be open about the disease to try and help others . 'I hope by . sharing my experiences I can show my support to digestive health . sufferers across the UK.' Sam now maintains her slim shape through regular workouts with her personal . trainer. 'We don't do a lot of cardio - I don't want to shed weight,' she says. 'It's . more about toning up and getting strong. I lost all my muscle when I . was ill - so I am just trying to build myself up again. I do interval . training, small weights, squats and lunges.' Sam has also managed to cut her medication down to just one pill a day, which she will need to take for life. So . far, she hasn't had any more flare-ups. 'If I stick to what I am . supposed to do, and try and avoid stress, then I hopefully won't have . another one. She still isn't sure what triggered the disease in the first place. 'It might have been stress - we just don't really know'. What . was clear was by the time she was diagnosed was that she was extremely ill. Test results showed she had so many ulcers in her gut that she'd been . suffering the condition for about a year. Despite the symptoms being there - such as needing the loo three or four times a day - she hadn't realised how ill she was. Sam, who now weighs just under 9st, follows a simple, healthy diet . 'I . just put it down to rushing around, being hungover, having an upset . tummy - that sort of thing,' she says. 'I didn't think to go to the . doctor. 'Now I just want to raise . awareness  - it's a really horrible, painful condition and I want to . help other people get diagnosed and avoid flare-ups. And she continues to be open about the disease to try and help others. 'After I went on This Morning and spoke about it, loads of people said to me they got tested for it and some were diagnosed. 'It's . not the most glamorous thing to talk about but as long as I'm raising awareness and help others, then I'll keep doing it.'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Women who live near green open spaces tend to give birth to heavier babies, scientists say. Researchers looked at 40,000 single births in Tel Aviv, Israel, to work out what impact living within 300 metres of a major green space during pregnancy has on birth outcomes. 'Major' was defined as being 5,000 meters squared, while green spaces included parks, community gardens or even cemeteries that were partly or completely covered with grass, trees, . shrubs, or other vegetation. Women who live near large green spaces have bigger babies, research suggests. This may be because those from poorer areas have less access to large areas of outside space . 'We found that that overall, an increase of surrounding greenery near the home was associated with a significant increase of birth weight - and decreased risk for low birth weight,' said Professor Michael Friger, of Ben Gurion University Department of Public Health. 'This was the first study outside of the United States and Europe demonstrating associations between greenery and birth weight, as well as the first to report the association with low birth weight.' One reason may be because the lowest birth weight occurred in the most economically deprived areas with lack of access to green spaces. The study was published in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine. It comes after U.S. researchers found that trees in urban areas save over 850 lives a year by scrubbing the air clean. Although they ability to remove pollution from the atmosphere equates to an average air quality improvement of less than 1 per cent, researchers estimate this prevents 670,000 cases of serious chest, heart or circulation problems in U.S. cities alone. 'In terms of impacts on human health, trees in urban areas are substantially more important than rural trees due to their proximity to people. 'We found that in general, the greater . the tree cover, the greater the pollution removal, and the greater the . removal and population density, the greater the value of human health . benefits.' Other new research has found that trees in urban areas save over 850 lives a year by scrubbing the air clean . Michael Rains, Director of the Forest Service's Northern Research . Station said: 'With more than 80 per . cent of Americans living in urban area, this research underscores how . truly essential urban forests are to people across the nation.' The study looked at four pollutants which have established air quality standards, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) in aerodynamic diameter. The effects of air pollution on pulmonary, cardiac, vascular, and neurological systems were also taken into account. The research, which was the first national study using air pollution modelling to reveal the life saving qualities of trees, was published in the journal .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A mother has hit out at the NHS for funding 'boob jobs for fame-hungry glamour models' while refusing to pay for surgery to help her disabled son walk. Kirsty Harrington, 23, was astounded when she was told hospitals did not 'routinely fund' the type of surgery that could radically transform the life of her son Hayden. The wheelchair-bound five-year-old has a type of cerebral palsy called spastic diplegia. Scroll down for video . Furious: Kirsty Harrington's son Hayden has cerebral palsy and can only get around with a wheelchair or walking sticks. She was astounded to be told hospitals did not 'routinely fund' the type of surgery that could help Hayden walk . Unfair: Ms Harrington lambasted the NHS for . funding 'boob jobs for fame hungry glamour models like Josie . Cunningham', but not her son's surgery.  Earlier this year, Birmingham . barman Sam Barton was branded Britain’s vainest man when he revealed he . had a state-funded £5,000 nose job . This causes muscle stiffness, meaning he cannot walk more than a few steps unaided. There is no cure for the condition but an operation called selective dorsal rhizotomy (SDR) could improve Hayden’s walking. The procedure would release tension in . his legs, allowing him to undergo more intensive physiotherapy to let . him walk unaided – so he can try to fulfill his dream of playing football. But NHS England will not fund SDR because the treatment is not considered to offer 'value for money or clinical effectiveness' compared to other procedures. It was removed from a list of publicly-funded operations in April 2013 after a consultation. Mrs Harrington is now launching a £25,000 fundraising drive to pay for her son's surgery privately. Speaking about fury, she said: 'They will fund things like boob jobs on the NHS, but they won’t carry out surgery like this on all children who desperately need it. It is shocking. 'It’s disgusting that there are people who actually need operations and they can’t have them because the Government can’t fund it. 'But the NHS will pay for boob jobs for fame hungry glamour models like Josie Cunningham who just wants to be a celebrity and use the operation to make thousands of pounds for herself. 'Hayden’s life would be changed by the . surgery but instead they are paying for people who want to copy TV stars . to have nose jobs.' Struggle: Hayden, pictured here aged one, can crawl, but cannot sit up properly or walk unaided as his condition causes muscle stiffness. There is no cure, but the procedure would release tension in his legs . Upset: Hayden (pictured left at nine months) is frustrated at not being able to do what other children can . Hayden lives with his mother, father Matt, 25 and four-year-old brother Callum, in Solihull, West Midlands. He was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy when he was 18-months-old and has been undergoing regular physiotherapy ever since. Hayden currently gets around with the help of a wheelchair or walking frames. But his parents claim he could be able to walk unaided if he had the life-changing surgery. Ms Harrington, his full-time carer, said: 'By cutting out the bad nerves, the good ones would be left intact, and his muscles would loosen. 'Hayden’s legs would be easier to move and he would be able to walk. He would have a much happier and easier life. Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Due . to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise . procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a . general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs. 'At the moment he is frustrated at not being able to do what other children can do. 'He can stand against furniture but cannot walk unaided. He bunny hops, or crawls, but can’t sit up properly. 'He goes to a mainstream school and they are very good, adapting things like sports days so he can take part. But it is very hard for him when he can’t keep up.' Josie Cunningham sparked fury when she had her breasts enlarged from a 32A to 36DD on the NHS in 2009 - costing the taxpayer £4,800. And last month the mother-of-two defended her decision to sell four tickets to the birth of her next child. The part-time model has sold two for £5,000 and two for £10,000, which include permission to film and take photographs. And she infuriated taxpayers earlier this year when she tweeted a snap of herself earlier with the caption: 'Sticks and stones may break my bones, but tax payers will always fund me.' Earlier this year, Birmingham barman Sam Barton was branded Britain’s vainest man when he revealed he had a state-funded £5,000 nose job. The 22-year-old underwent the operation on the NHS in May in a bid to emulate his hero Joey Essex and become the 'perfect man'. An NHS spokesman said: 'The NHS does not routinely fund SDR for the condition because, although it is a promising treatment, current evidence on its effectiveness in such cases is limited. 'SDR surgery shows real promise for some patients with mobility problems and that’s why we want to explore it further through our innovative evaluation programme.' Ms Harington has raised £500 since launching her campaign a month ago and has several fundraising plans lined up to try and reach her £25,000 target. She said: 'It is going really well so far. We have about £500 at the moment. 'Hayden’s dad Matt and a couple of his mates are cycling to Cardiff. It should be about 125 miles. We'll keep fundraising from there.' To donate to Hayden’s fund, visit www.gofundme.com/b26gso . Josie Cunningham from Leeds, had a boob job on the NHS to boost her confidence . The number of breast enlargements has soared by 145 per cent in a decade to 10,504 – costing up to £52.5million. Many . of these will be reconstructions following cancer treatment, but the . increase far outstrips any rise in breast cancer diagnoses. In one case, Josie Cunningham had an enlargement after saying her 32A chest was ruining her life. The . former prostitute and wannabe glamour model provoked outrage when it . emerged she had a £4,800 state-funded boob job at the same NHS Trust . that refused to pay for surgery to allow a disabled two-year-old to . walk. She later claimed her . breasts, which were boosted from a 32A to a 36D, were 'so big' she . found them embarrassing, and called on the NHS to pay for a reduction. And . barman Sam Barton, 22, of Sutton Coldfield, in the West Midlands, was . given a nose job by the NHS – and boasted how easy it was to get the . £5,000 procedure. He now . says he expects the taxpayer to foot the bill for further surgery, . including another nose job, as well as having his ears pinned back and . jaw reshaped. The obesity . epidemic has also had an effect on the surgery bill, with the number of . liposuction operations in 2012/13 standing at 1,926 – up 40 per cent in . ten years. The cost in the . most recent year will have been up to £9.6million, according to NHS . Choices which says the operation costs between £1,500 and £5,000. There . has also been a 39 per cent rise in the number undergoing eyelid . surgery to 4,966 – costing up to £19.9million. This operation is . supposed to be carried out to treat affected vision. And 8,537 nose jobs were carried out in 2013/14 – up 4 per cent and costing £34.1million. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s ludicrous the NHS pays for procedures that are not . based on strict medical needs.’ The figures were compiled by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, following a request from the Daily Mail. It also showed that up to . £20.3million was spent on breast reduction operations, £5.8million on . tummy tucks and £5.7million on ear pinning. However, these totals have . declined over the past decade. Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told a Westminster lunch: ‘We should not be doing cosmetic work on the NHS.’ Roger . Goss, of pressure group Patient Concern, said: ‘There are two types of . cosmetic surgery – the type that happens after illness and the sort . where someone is just trying to look better. 'We . agree with the Secretary of State that this kind of thing is no longer . affordable on the NHS.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A woman who went to her GP about a sore throat was horrified to learn she also had kidney failure. Paula Rowlett, 32, went to her doctor and . was diagnosed with a throat infection. But tests also revealed her blood . pressure was sky-high because of the kidney problems. The college lecturer, St Helens, Merseyside, needed dialysis four times a day and was told a donor was desperately needed if she was to live a normal life. Paula Rowlett (right), 32, was suffering from kidney failure and desperately needed a transplant. When her cousin Lynley Everest (left) 40, heard about her predicament, she flew more than 10,000 miles from Australia to give one of hers . When her cousin Lynley Everest, 40, heard about her predicament, she flew more than 10,000 miles from Sydney, Australia, to donate one of her kidneys. The operation took place at the Royal Liverpool Hospital on July 21. Ms Rowe said: 'Doctors couldn’t confirm what caused the kidney failure but it was high blood pressure that caused the damage - they just couldn’t repair themselves. 'It was a huge shock for me because I consider myself fit and healthy - I used to go boxing three times a week.' Ms Rowe had only met her cousin for the first time in 2007, when Ms Everest's mother - who had moved from Liverpool to Australia aged 18 - passed away. The transplant surgery took place at the Royal Liverpool Hospital on July 21 . They kept in touch on social media sites and upon hearing of her cousin's ill health, Ms Everst travelled to the UK last year to try and help. 'She knew she was the same blood group as me and that’s why she wanted to be put forward,' MsRowlett said. Upon arriving last November, Ms Everest, a sales and financial manager, underwent a series of scans - which thankfully revealed her kidney was a suitable match. She said: 'Once I found out Paula was unwell, I did the research. 'A lot of people have asked me ""when did you decide?’"". But it didn’t ever occur to me not to do this. 'Paula is an incredibly positive person. What a lot of people would moan about, she doesn’t - it’s just her character.' Despite Ms Everest not being able to board a plane for six weeks after the operation, she maintains it was worth it. Jean Shallcross, who completed the transplant, said: 'We agreed with the donor a date she would be able to come as she needs to stay here for six weeks in case of post-operative complications. 'She came the week before the operation and an independent assessor did the Human Tissue Authority test. 'This ensures people have not been coerced or paid to supply an organ. 'She also had a compatibility test and met the surgeon before going into theatre.'","Paula Rowlett, 32, was on dialysis and desperately needed a donor .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Joe Alder suffered liver failure after taking low-dose antibiotics for three years to prevent bladder infections . A mother who took an antibiotic tablet every day claims she almost died after the drug triggered liver disease. Joe Alder, 36, had been taking low-dose antibiotics for three years to prevent recurrent bladder infections. But she was rushed to hospital in April last year when the whites of her eyes and her skin turned bright yellow. Doctors discovered she had liver failure and Ms Alder claims she was nicknamed 'Marge Simpson' by hospital staff because of her jaundiced skin caused by the disease. Thanks to a liver transplant she survived, but the effects have left her feeling 'like an old lady in a young woman’s body'. Ms Alder, from Garstang, Lancashire, was prescribed the low-dose antibiotics after suffering recurring bladder infections. 'My doctor prescribed me this antibiotic on a low dose to stop me getting them,' she said. 'I had to take one tablet a night and had been taking them for about three years. In some women, taking such a dose can reduce the occurrence of bladder infections by up to 95 per cent. But of all types of prescription drugs, antibiotics are the ones most likely to cause liver damage, according to a study published in the journal Gastroenterology. Ms Alder said: 'I didn't give the fact [I had been taking them so long] a second thought, as my doctor had prescribed them. I thought they were safe.' But she was forced to return to the doctor in April last year after she began to feel unwell and vomit. Her doctor suspected she had a gut infection and prescribed antibiotics, but two days later - when her skin turned yellow - she was rushed to hospital. Ms Alder, who lives with fiance Andy McKendry, says: 'At the hospital, they took my bloods and then I saw a doctor who sent me home and told me to return four days later for an ultrasound.' Ms Alder, 36, was given a massive dose of steroids to fight the liver damage. She is now out of the danger zone but suffers many side-effects as a result of them, including a bloated face, bad acne, weight gain, and muscle pain and weakness that has left her wheelchair bound (pictured left with medications to treat these symptoms) But when Mr McKendry woke up the following morning to see her skin become bright yellow, he took her straight to A&E. This time, she was admitted immediately and a blood test revealed that her liver inflammation . results were in the thousands - when the normal marker should have been . about 40. Ms Alder claims she was told the low-dose antibiotic she had been taking was most . likely responsible for triggering the liver disease. Looking back, she said she had been feeling exhausted, but had blamed it on juggling family life with full-time work. By the time she was diagnosed her . condition was so dire she was referred to St James’s Hospital in Leeds . and put on the liver transplant list. She . said: 'I was so yellow that the nurses started calling me Marge out of . the Simpsons and Andy began calling me ""Dora The Explorer"" because of my . black bob and yellow skin. 'We . kept our humour and positivity throughout it all. You have to keep . smiling as, if you didn’t, it would all get too much for you. 'I . started thinking about the future if anything happened to me and it got . to the point where I sorted out wills and where the children would go. All I was thinking about was Andy and my children.' Ms Alder said: 'I was so yellow that the nurses started calling me Marge out of the Simpsons' (pictured) Remarkably, Ms Alder, who has two teenage children - Josh, 17 and Chloe, 13 - says she managed to pull through without a liver transplant, thanks to intensive steroid treatment. But she added her life has changed dramatically and her mobility has been reduced. When she left hospital, she could barely walk and tests showed she had steroid induced myopathy - when the steroids weaken the muscles. Ms Alder, a former project manager, said: 'I had all the side effects you get with the steroids, including a bloated face, bad acne, weight gain, not being able to walk and immense pain throughout my body. 'When I came off the steroids, my walking still wasn’t great and they are currently doing further tests as they believe the trauma may have kick-started another disorder.' Fifteen months on, she says she still feels 'horrendous'. “My mobility is still affected and although I am OK pottering around at home, when I go out, I have to use a wheelchair. 'I feel exhausted and suffer from chronic body pain which I have to take medication for. 'I really have to pace myself. I lost my job because of being poorly as I had to have so much time off and I would not be able to do that job now anyway.  feel like an old lady in a young woman’s body.' She is now trying to raise awareness of the damage antibiotics can cause. 'My aim is to raise awareness of non-alcohol related liver disease and people like myself where taking prescription medication brought on the condition. 'I think anyone on regular prescribed medication should have regular blood tests to check body function to make sure they are not having an adverse effect.'","Joe Alder was prescribed low-dose antibiotics, which she took for 3 years .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Amie Miller, 15, died within days of being admitted to Basildon Hospital due to lethal swelling on the brain . A teenage girl died after a catalogue of failings at a hospital already condemned for poor care. Amie Miller - who would have celebrated her 21st birthday this week - had been suffering agonising headaches while completing her mock GCSEs. The 15-year-old student began vomiting and fitting on November 16, 2008, and was immediately rushed to Basildon Hospital A&E. But she died within days of being admitted due to lethal swelling on the brain. Last year a coroner ruled 'serious failings' in care at Basildon Hospital had contributed to her death. The damning verdict came at the end of a three-day inquest at Chelmsford Coroner’s Court last September. The inquest had heard that Amie was given Propofol - a powerful sedative blamed for the death of pop star Michael Jackson - despite it not being recommended for people under 18. The inquest jury also found medics at the hospital missed a string of opportunities to save Amie’s life in 2008. In a damning narrative verdict, they said staff had failed to take even the most basic steps – such as checking whether she could open her eyes, or examining the size of her pupils – which might have alerted them to her injury. After the inquest, Amie’s stepfather Mbarek Aitmarri said the past five years had been torture. He said the hospital – which is under special measures and is one of 14 singled out for having high death rates – had ‘evaded’ responsibility for her death and had failed to respond to 81 allegations of negligence they had lodged. Her parents are now taking legal action. Her father, Mbarek Aitmarri, from Thurrock, Essex, said: 'She wanted to be a paediatrician. What she wanted to be is what the people who failed her are. The betrayal is unbelievable. 'All her peers and friends met up in the cemetery - they are now in their twenties and getting their degrees. An inquest heard Amie was given Propofol - a powerful sedative blamed for the death of Michael Jackson (right) - despite it not being recommended for people under 18. Her parents Sonia Aitmarri and step-father Mbarek Aitmarri (left) are now taking legal action . 'I wish we were at that stage, but all we have is basically a hole in the ground. We have all suffered post-traumatic stress. 'Most people who lose someone go through a grieving process, but for us, it hasn’t started.' Propofol is an intravenous anaesthetic drug widely used in operating rooms to induce unconsciousness. It is generally given through an IV needle in the hand. Patients given Propofol take less time to regain consciousness than those administered certain other drugs, and they report waking up more clear-headed and refreshed, says University of Chicago psychopharmacologist James Zacny. It has also been implicated in drug abuse, with people using it to 'chill out' - or to commit suicide, Zacny said. Accidental deaths linked to abuse have been reported. The powerful drug has a very narrow therapeutic window, meaning it doesn't take doses much larger than the medically recommended amount to stop a person's breathing. An overdose that stops breathing can result in a build-up of carbon dioxide, causing the heart to beat erratically and leading to cardiac arrest, said Dr. John Dombrowski, a member of the board of directors of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. The family believe they were wrongly advised to abandon a vital post-mortem examination because they wanted to donate Amie’s organs to others in need. Her father added: Amie died in 2008 and we are still waiting for the hospital to perform an investigation. 'After she died, they approached us within half an hour. 'I was asking what was going to happen to Amie and the lady at the hospital said there was someone there for organ donation. 'They explained if they did a post-mortem examination, it wouldn't be possible to donate Amie’s organs. 'But when we later had a meeting with the hospital, we found a post-mortem examination could have been conducted without the organ donation being affected.' The family marked what would have been Amie’s 21st birthday by releasing a balloon in her memory from their home in Stanford-le-Hope on Monday. A statement released by Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said the trust 'would like to share its condolences with Amie Miller’s family at what must be an incredibly difficult time. 'We have apologised for the failings in the care provided to Amie, and have since introduced a number of changes in the treatment of children and adults with neurological illness, including more regular observations.'","Amie Miller, 15, had been suffering agonising headaches during exam period .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Fears that the morning after pill may be less effective in overweight women are unfounded, experts say. Last November the maker of Norlevo - a morning after pill available in France - changed its packaging to state the pill did not work among women over a certain weight. At least 200,000 prescriptions a year are written out for Levonelle, . Britain’s most popular emergency contraceptive, which contains the same key ingredient as Norlevo - as does Plan B One-Step available in the U.S. Morning after pills such as Levonelle - contain the ingredient levonorgestrel  - are effective in heavier women, experts say . The French manufacturer referenced studies which showed the pill is less effective among women who weigh more than 11st 11lb and . does not work at all in women over 12st 8lb. The average British . woman weighs around 11 stone. But after a review, the European Medicines Agency has said Norlevo is suitable for heavier women. In a statement, the EMA said it had assessed all the available evidence and announced the data 'are too limited and not robust enough to conclude with certainty' that the pill's efficacy is reduced in heavier women. While results of these studies should be included in the product information, current warnings on Norlevo's packaging should be deleted, it added. The morning after pill contains a higher dose of the hormone in regular birth control pills. The drug is thought to prevent . pregnancy by interfering with the release of eggs and disrupting . fertilisation. It may also stop any fertilised egg from implanting in . the womb. Taking it within 72 hours of intercourse can cut the chances of pregnancy by up to 89 per cent, but it works best within the first 24 hours. Fears had been raised after a French morning after pill manufacturer said its product was less effective among women who weigh more than 11st 11lb and did not work at all in women over 12 stone 8lb . The issue about weight and efficacy came to light two years . ago, when an Edinburgh University study found that obese women were more . than three times as likely as those of normal weight to become pregnant . after taking the morningafter pill. The link was particularly strong . for levonorgestrel-based pills. It is thought that the drug may . be diluted in bigger women or broken down more quickly by their bodies. It is also possible that the drug is soaked up by their fat cells, . stopping it from working properly. Professor Anna Glasier, the . study’s lead researcher, advised bigger women to have a copper coil, or . IUD, fitted or take EllaOne, another morning after pill containing a . different chemical. It works for longer than Levonelle and is more . effective and can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex.","Fears sparked last year when French manufacturer changed packaging .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . The NHS has been forced to spend £1m on super-sized CT scanners to deal with the escalating obesity crisis. The new machines can penetrate five times the amount of fat - and the weight they can take has nearly doubled from 25st (160kg) to 47st (300kg). Around 65 per cent of people in England are now overweight or obese - and the NHS already spends an estimated £5.1billion a year treating obesity-related illnesses. The obesity crisis has forced the NHS to spend £1m on CT scanners. The new machines can penetrate five times the amount of fat - and the weight they can take has nearly doubled from 25st (160kg) to 47st (300kg) CT scans use X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body. More detailed than standard X-rays, the scans can produce images of . structures inside the body, including the internal organs, blood . vessels, bones and tumours. The new super-size machines also scan at twice the speed than conventional ones, The Mirror reported. This is significant as patients are usually required to hold their breath during the scan - since chest movement can affect the image - and some obese people can find it harder to hold their breath. A recent report on CT scanners compiled by Siemens Healthcare found that over the past two decades, the weight allowance of imaging tables has increased by 88 per cent. X ray generator power, which contributes to scanners providing a good quality image despite the patient’s size, has increased by 380 per cent - from around 50KW to 240KW . The size of the bore, where the patient lies, has increased from 70cm to 80cm. The changing shape of CT scanners in response to patient waistlines. The new machines can penetrate five times the amount of fat - and the weight they can take has nearly doubled . Commenting on the report, Russell Lodge, . CT Business Manager at Siemens Healthcare, said: 'The number of . bariatric patients being referred for CT scans has more than doubled in . the last 25 years and this is predicted to continue rising. A computerised tomography (CT) scan uses X-rays and a computer to create detailed images of the inside of the body. CT scans are also sometimes known as CAT scans, which stands for computerised axial tomography. During a CT scan, which is painless and takes five to 10 minutes, depending on the part of the body being scanned, patients lie on their backs on a bed. The scanner consists of an X-ray tube that rotates around the body and the patient is usually moved continuously through this rotating beam. The X-rays are received by a detector on the opposite side of the body and an image of the scan will be produced by a computer. The images produced by a CT scan are called tomograms and are more detailed than standard X-rays. A CT scan can produce images of structures inside the body, including the internal organs, blood vessels, bones and tumours. Source: NHS Choices . 'We have witnessed a growing need and . demand for obesity provision from hospital imaging departments across . the country to ensure patients of all sizes can gain access to the . treatment they need.' One large hospital in the North East of England recently purchased a £1m super-sized scanner, according to The Mirror. Figures released earlier this year by Public Health England revealed this is the fattest region, where 68 per cent are overweight or obese. And in June, a Freedom of Information request found rising obesity levels are forcing health bosses to spend millions of pounds adapting hospitals and buying specialist equipment to handle larger patients. Money is being been spent on reinforced beds, wider corridors and even larger morgue fridges as a result of the obesity epidemic. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: 'The rapidly expanding size of CT scanners is shocking, but sadly, not surprising. 'But it is absolutely tragic that as a nation we are becoming so fat we are having to redesign medical equipment.' Two years ago it was reported that NHS hospitals had been forced to ask zoos and vets to scan patients who were too obese to fit into hospital scanners. The Royal Veterinary College said at the time that its CT scanners, customised for horses, could be . used to accommodate patients weighing 30 stone or more but they would . need to get a special licence to scan humans.","New machines can penetrate five times the amount of fat and scan quicker .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Michele Price, 47, was left in a coma after routine surgery to investigate pelvic pain went horribly wrong . A woman admitted to hospital for keyhole surgery was left fighting for life after doctors accidentally tore her bowel. Michele Price was admitted to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham to have her pelvic pain investigated. The 47-year-old went home the same day but was rushed back to hospital early the next morning, suffering from severe abdominal pain and vomiting. A CT scan performed two days later revealed her bowel had been sliced open and fluid was leaking into the rest of her body. Further exploratory surgery then confirmed she had two holes in her bowel. Doctors removed a section of her intestines and flushed out as much as the infection as they could. But they were forced to leave her stomach open for two days in an attempt to avoid Ms Price needing a stoma bag fitted. The mother-of-two then required further surgery two days later to re-attach her bowel and have her stomach sewn up. But medics were forced to leave her in an induced coma for five days to help fight the infection which had caused her organs fail. Ms Price was eventually discharged from hospital two weeks later - but has been left with horrific scars all down her stomach. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust has now apologised and Mrs Price's solictors have secured an admission of liability from the Trust and Secretary of State for Health, paving the way for a settlement to be reached. Ms Price, who lives in Long Eaton, Derbyshire, with her fiance Stephen Harcourt, 47, and daughter Leah Price, 14, said: 'My life has been turned upside down following my horrific ordeal. 'My original surgery was keyhole surgery which is designed to be minimally invasive and leave little, to no, scarring. 'It was meant to be a routine procedure I went into hospital for, but instead I was left fighting for my life. 'The scarring on my stomach is horrendous and I am incredibly self-conscious of it. 'I feel truly let down by staff as I suffered so many needless complications and my life has been devastated as a result.' After being discharged from hospital, Ms Price's hair fell out because stress and amount of medication she was on. Ms Price with fiance Stephen and daughter Leah. She says the trauma of the botched surgery made her hair fall out and forced her to give up work . 'It . was coming out in clumps, it was really a mess and looked like a . patchwork quilt - so in the end, I shaved it off and was forced to buy . wigs.' Ms Price was also forced to close down her cleaning business after her ordeal. She added: 'I am pleased that with the help of my legal team that . the Trust has finally made an admission of liability for what happened . to me. 'I . just hope that this paves the way to the conclusion of the legal . proceedings so that I can try to start to put my life back together.' Medical . law experts at Irwin Mitchell found a host of errors had been made during the surgery on August 9, 2011, which had led to the bowel perforating. It is claimed that staff failed to appreciate that a perforation was the likely cause of Ms Prices's symptoms  - and did not perform an immediate CT scan on her readmission the next day. Following the initial keyhold procedure, she was also treated by junior doctors who failed to detect peritonitis, multi-organ failure, abscesses, scarring and an incisional hernia. Tests carried out when Ms Price was severely ill after surgery revealed her  bowel had been sliced open and fluid was leaking into the rest of her body. She has been left with scars all down her stomach . Sarah Rowland, a specialist medical . lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'Michele suffered a truly horrendous . ordeal in hospital following what should have been a simple and routine . procedure with minimal recovery time. 'Instead she was left fighting for her life and needing further operations that have left her with extensive scarring - a permanent reminder of the horrific ordeal she has been through.' Dr Stephen Fowlie, Medical Director at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We reiterate our apologies to Ms Price and her family for the shortcomings in our care in 2011. 'Although Ms Price was reviewed by specialist registrars or consultants on each of the three days between her initial and second operation, we accepted our external expert’s view that senior review should have been more frequent. This lesson was shared with all staff in the department. 'Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust has done considerable work in the last two years to improve recognition of deterioration in patients, and to speed-up escalation to senior doctors when it does occur.'","Michele Price, 47, had keyhole surgery to investigate pelvic pain .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Isla Todd has lymphoedema, a condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues . A three-year-old girl suffers from a rare disease that means going on a summer holiday could kill her. Isla Todd has lymphoedema, a condition that causes swelling in the body's tissue. It usually affects the arms and legs and can lead to pain and a loss of mobility. The condition is caused by damage or disruption to the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from tissues. In patients such as Isla, the excess fluid will cause the tissue to swell. Her lower legs are constantly swollen and any cut or infection could be deadly. This means high temperatures, grazes or insect bites can be fatal, her mother Heather says. As a result, she and husband Andrew cannot take their daughter on a family holiday to Spain because of the temperature, and Isla isn't allowed to run around in the park like other children. Secondary lymphoedema is a well-known side effect of chemotherapy, which can damage the lymph nodes. However Isla, from Glasgow, is thought to be the only child in Scotland born with the condition. Her mother, 45, said: 'We have to be so careful with Isla so she doesn’t get the slightest knock. 'If we were to go to somewhere like Spain, the temperature increase would increase the swelling in her legs and that would be deadly. 'Also there’s more chance of her being bitten by an insect out there. 'She’s never been barefoot because any slight cut or graze means we have to rush her straight to hospital. 'Whenever she runs around my heart is in my mouth.' The lymphoedema means Isla's lymphatic system, which helps regulate the body’s immune system, hasn’t fully developed below her knees. If she is cut, a circle has to be drawn around the mark to monitor the infections growth for cellulitis - a serious bacterial infection. She also wears protective stockings . and her mother always carries a first aid kit - complete with . anti-bacterial medicines and a special pen - in case anything happens. It took nine months for Isla to be diagnosed - despite her being born two weeks early with severely swollen legs. Mrs Todd said: 'The nurses panicked as soon as Isla was delivered - they could see something was wrong. The condition is caused by damage or disruption to the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from tissues. In patients such as Isla, the excess fluid means her legs are constantly swollen and any cut or infection could be fatal . Isla also wears protective stockings and her mother, Heather, always carries a first aid kit - complete with anti-bacterial medicines - in case anything happens . 'She was two weeks early but still weighed 9lbs and her feet and legs were really swollen. 'I don’t think anyone had seen it before.' The University of Glasgow is home of the UK’s longest serving lymphoedema programme and staff there work closely with Isla and her family. A spokeswoman for the university said: 'We believe Isla is the only child to be born in Scotland with the condition. 'Most of the time people get secondary lymphoedema, but this is usually a result of their lymph nodes being damage from cancer treatment. Isla's parents are fundraising for the Lymphoedema Support Network to help find a cure. Lymphoedema is a rare condition that causes . swelling in the body's tissue. It usually affects the arms and legs and . can lead to pain and a loss of mobility. The condition is caused by damage or disruption to the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from tissues. Damage means the excess fluid cannot be returned to the circulatory system, causing the tissue to swell. There are two main types of lymphoedema: . Primary lymphoedema – which develops at birth or shortly after puberty and is caused by faulty genes. Secondary lymphoedema – caused by damage to the lymphatic system as a result of an infection, injury, trauma, or cancer. The latter often develops as a side effect of cancer treatment. Surgery is often necessary to remove lymph glands to prevent a cancer . from spreading, this can damage the lymphatic system. It is estimated that 1 in 10,000 people are affected by primary lymphoedema. Secondary lymphoedema is a relatively common condition, affecting an estimated 100,000 people in the UK.","Isla Todd, 3, has lymphoedema, which causes swelling in the body's tissues .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . MERS - Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - may be airbone, meaning it can spread easier . The deadly MERS virus which has killed more than 300 people may be airborne, it has been claimed. Saudi scientists drew the conclusion after finding gene fragments of the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in air from a barn housing an infected camel. They say this suggests the disease may be transmitted through the air. This is concerning because viruses that spread through air - such as flu viruses - are . far more likely to spread swiftly and widely in human populations than . those that can only move from an animal to a person, or from person to . person, via direct contact. MERS, a serious respiratory illness caused by a virus known as a coronavirus (CoV), has infected at least 850 people since it first emerged two years ago. Of these people, it has killed 32, according to latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The vast majority of human cases have been in Saudi Arabia, but isolated MERS cases have been reported across Europe, Asia and the U.S.  in people linked who have recently travelled in the Middle East. Scientists are not sure of the origin of the virus, but several studies have linked it to camels. Some experts believe it is being passed to humans through close physical contact or through the consumption of camel meat or camel milk. However, the latest research suggests the detection of the virus in air samples was concerning and needed to be followed up, Reuters Health reports. The study was published in the online journal of the American Society for Microbiology, mBio. For the research, a team led by Esam Azhar, an associate professor of medical virology at King Abdulaziz University, collected three air samples on three consecutive days from a camel barn near Jeddah. It was owned by a 43-year-old male MERS patient who later died from the disease. Four of the man's nine camels had shown signs of nasal discharge the week before he became ill, and he had applied a topical medicine in the nose of one of the sick camels a week before experiencing symptoms. Using a laboratory technique called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect levels of particular genes, the scientists found that the first air sample, collected on November 2013, contained genetic fragments of the MERS virus. Several studies have linked the origin of the virus to camels. The conclusions of the latest research were drawn after examining . air samples of a camel barn belonging to a man who later died from MERS . This was the same day that one of the patient's camels tested positive for the disease, they explained in a report of their work. The other samples did not test positive for the MERS virus - suggesting short or intermittent shedding of the virus into the air surrounding the camels, Professor Azhar said. Further tests of the first air sample confirmed the presence of MERS genetic sequences and showed the fragments were identical to those detected in the camel and its sick owner. He added: 'This study also underscores the importance of obtaining a detailed clinical history with particular emphasis on any animal exposure for any MERS case - especially because recent reports suggest higher risk of (MERS) infections among people working with camels.' The World Health Organisation and the Saudi Health Ministry have advised camel farm and slaughterhouse workers to take precautions against MERS by ensuring good hygiene, including frequent hand washing after touching animals, facial protection where feasible, and wearing of protective clothing.","Conclusion came after analysing air in barn housing an infected camel .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Adrian Tinsley suffered from symptoms such as nausea and back pain when his partner was pregnant - but they were actually signs of cancer . A father who suffered the same symptoms as his pregnant partner was horrified to learn they were actually signs of testicular cancer. Whenever Bethann Meakin complained of nausea or food cravings, Adrian Tinsley would do the same. The phenomenon, known as 'Couvade syndrome', is characterised by symptoms such as morning sickness, cramps, back pain and swollen stomachs in men whose partners are pregnant. Ms Meaken, 21, laughed off his ailments until a week before the birth when Mr Tinsley woke in the middle of the night with excruciating back pain. After being rushed to hospital at 2am, he mentioned to doctors he had a lump in his testicle. Eight hours later, tests revealed his symptoms were testicular cancer - which they believe he'd had for five years. Mr Tinsley, a delivery driver, said: 'I was absolutely petrified. I didn’t know whether they would be able to cure me and Scarlett was due in a week. 'All I could think was that I might never get to see her grow up. 'I knew I'd had the lump for five years, but I never expected it to be cancer. 'I did have it checked out in March 2009, but was told it was just fluid and nothing to worry about.' Testicular cancer is most common in men aged 15-44 and affects 2,000 each year in the UK. It is one of the most treatable cancers - 97 per cent of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis. The . most common symptom is a lump or swelling in one testicle, but 20 per . cent of patients also experience pain in their testicles or lower . abdomen. A feeling of 'heaviness' in the scrotum is another symptom. Following Mr Tinsley's diagnosis, what should have been a week of excitement ahead of Scarlett’s birth became a nightmare. Doctors found three tumours - one on his testicle, one in his groin and one on his back - which had caused the agonising pain. Mr Tinsley was transferred to another hospital in Birmingham to begin chemotherapy just three days later. Mr Tinsley with partner Beth Meakin and 10-month-old daughter Scarlett. Since his diagnosis a week before her birth, he has had treatment for three tumours . Expectant fathers can suffer from pregnancy symptoms, a study published in 2007 found. Morning sickness, cramps, back pain and swollen stomachs were all reported by men whose partners were pregnant. The phenomenon is known as 'Couvade syndrome'. Couvade comes from the French word 'couver' which means 'to hatch', but is not a recognised medical condition. It is not clear why some men have similar symptoms to their . partners, but it could be related to anxiety over the pregnancy, experts claim. In the study of men aged 19-55, expectant fathers reported a . range of symptoms, including cramps, back pain, mood swings, food . cravings, morning sickness, fatigue, depression, fainting, insomnia and . toothache. In more extreme cases, men developed swollen stomachs that looked like a 'baby bump', said the researchers, from London's St . George's Hospital. Most symptoms disappeared after the birth. Ms Meakin, . who had to drive from their home in Stoke-on-Trent to collect him the . day before the baby was due, said: 'I just thought he had Couvade . syndrome. 'Whenever my back hurt - his did. Whenever I felt sick - he did. 'He even had intense cravings. For two weeks all he wanted to eat was cheeseburgers. 'When he woke up with back ache it was the night after I had gone to hospital with contractions - so I just thought he was mirroring me again. ' The diagnosis 'completely turned our world upside down', she added. 'We went from being excited to have our first baby to the realisation I might end up a single mum.' The stress of Mr Tinsley’s illness caused Bethann’s blood pressure to soar and she had to be induced nine days after her due date, giving birth to daughter Scarlett. Mr Tinsley was forced to give up work, needing five bouts of chemotherapy and a lumpectomy in February this year. Ms Meakin added: 'It's been extremely hard work looking after them both. 'Adrian is so wiped out that he hasn’t been able to change a nappy yet in the 10 months Scarlett has been alive. 'Even if he could do it, he can’t as the chance of infection could be fatal for him. 'Fortunately, Scarlett is only 10 months old and doesn’t know what’s wrong with her daddy.' The couple became engaged in July 2012 and  had planned to wait until Scarlett could walk to marry. 'But we've now had to postpone any wedding plans until Adrian gets the all clear,' Ms Meakin said.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A young woman who suffered a heart attack aged 22 died just hours before she was due to be discharged. Leigh Holden, 22, was in good spirits about returning home on July 29 last year, an inquest heard. She had been admitted to the Northern General . Hospital in Sheffield after coughing up blood, having . previously suffered a major heart attack in March. But after several days in hospital, she appeared to be recovering, her father Keith said. Leigh Holden, 22, died four months after suffering a heart attack - on the day she was due to be discharged from hospital . 'He said: 'She was happy as a pig in muck - she was coming home. The nurse on duty had told her she was being discharged the following morning.' But shortly after Ms Holden's parents left the hospital at around 8pm, she suffered major medical complications. Despite efforts to resuscitate her, she died that evening. Ms Holden was a qualified hair stylist but at the time of her death was working as a telesales executive for an insurance firm. The inquest heard that after her heart attack, Ms Holden had a stent fitted to widen her artery and was on a twice-daily medication called ticagrelor. This is designed to prevent clots from forming in blood vessels by thinning the blood. After returning to hospital with coughing problems, she was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism - a blockage in the artery that transports blood to the lungs. As a result of her coughing up ‘life-threatening’ amounts of blood, doctors took the decision to reduce her ticagrelor dosage, due to fears she may lose even more blood. Ms Holden has been admitted to the Northern General Hospital in Sheffield after coughing up blood . Dr Robin Condliffe, who helped treat Ms Holden, said the decision was taken to reduce her risk of dying from blood loss - but added it did increase the chance of complications with her stent. Earlier in the hearing, pathologist Dr Julian Burton said he had identified the cause of death as stent thrombosis - where the stent becomes blocked by a blood clot. Dr Condliffe said he did not believe the change in medication had caused the stent thrombosis, but had ‘contributed’ to it. Nevertheless, he felt the right treatment decisions had been taken as, had the medication not been changed, there was a strong chance Ms Holden would have died from the amount of blood she was coughing up. 'We would have been asked the question, ""Why didn’t you withhold it?’ and that would have been a harder thing to justify,' he said. Assistant coroner Louise Slater adjourned the inquest and said she would be giving a narrative conclusion. The hearing will resume next month.","Leigh Holden had suffered a heart attack in March last year .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Nigel Tinsley had the 5cm brain tumour removed through his nose in an eight-hour operation . A grandfather diagnosed with a tumour in his brain had the 5cm growth removed through his nose. Nigel Tinsley first noticed something was wrong when his eyesight began to fail. The 69-year-old visited his optician . within a week of discovering the problem - but was told there was nothing wrong. It was only after he was referred to hospital that tests revealed he had a tumour on the pituitary gland in his brain. This was pressing on his optic nerves, causing him to slowly lose his sight. To his surprise, doctors said they would remove the growth by sucking it out through his nose. The grandfather-of-five has now made a full recovery after the operation at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham last September. Mr Tinsley, who lives with his wife Jenny in Tettenhall, in the West Midlands, said: 'My sight had got so bad that I lost my wife while shopping in Waitrose. I just couldn't see her at the end of the aisle. 'It came on really suddenly - I was practically blind and couldn't read a thing. 'I had gone from being able to read a car number plate from 25 yards - as you need to for the driving test - to not even being able to see the end of my garden.' Left untreated for much longer, he would have gone blind, he says. 'My optician has always been very good but he couldn't find anything wrong with my eyes.' But an MRI scan at New Cross Hospital revealed he had a pituitary tumour. This was pressing on the optic nerves, causing him to slowly lose his sight. 'Looking . back, there had probably been other minor symptoms,' said Mr Tinsley. 'But I thought ""I'm . bound to get a little tired sometimes because I'm 69"".' The treatment, which uses an endoscope - a thin, flexible tube with a camera - meant he . could return home within a week of the operation. The neurosurgeon who carried out the . operation, Alessandro Paluzzi, said tumours on the skull base were . difficult to remove using conventional procedures. He . said: 'The operation is extremely invasive and requires a long stay in . hospital with breathing and feeding tubes, and leaves visible scarring. 'It also carries a greater risk of brain damage. 'However, . the endoscopic surgery allows the tumour to be removed via the nostrils . without causing disfigurement or damage to the brain.' An MRI scan at New Cross Hospital revealed Mr Tinsley (with his neurosurgeon Alessandro Paluzzi) had a pituitary tumour. This was pressing on the optic nerves, causing him to slowly lose his sight . The tumour is reached by working through one nostril and making a hole in the back of the nasal cavity into the bottom of the skull. Through this hole, the surgeon can see the bottom of the pituitary gland and the tumour. Cutting instruments, also mounted on flexible or telescopic arms, are used to remove the growth in pieces - leaving no scarring. Mr Tinsley said: 'Although I initially felt groggy, I recovered quickly. By the end of the week I could read anything. 'I had my operation on the Saturday. It took eight hours, and I was pretty poorly for a couple of days. 'But on the Tuesday I woke up and looked out of the window, where I could see the clock tower at Birmingham University a quarter of a mile away. It was amazing.' He is now fundraising to help the hospital's appeal to raise £250,000 for three brand new pieces of equipment, which will allow more patients to receive the same treatment he benefited from.","Nigel Tinsley had a tumour on the pituitary gland in his brain .

"By . Sian Boyle . The HS2 line has come under fire from the Church of England – over concerns that human remains will be disturbed. The Archbishop’s Council, one of the Church’s most powerful organisations, called for ‘ecclesiastical safeguards’ before the HS2 Bill is passed into law to prevent the digging up of graves to make way for the rail line. The council, which is led by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York, is fiercely opposed to the line because human remains will not  be ‘treated in a decent and  reverent manner’. The Church wants the government to include 'ecclesiastical safeguards' before approving the controversial £43bn project, (artist's impression pictured) It says it cannot back proposals for the £43 billion route unless MPs change legislation to give greater protection to the graves which would have to be exhumed. The Church is said to be keen to avoid a repeat of the excavation of St Pancras Station during the building of the Channel Tunnel rail link, when graves were dug up with JCBs. Sir Tony Baldry, the Tory MP and Second Church Estate’s Commissioner, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I would hope HS2 will be willing to engage and consider what they can do to mitigate the impact on churchyards and remains they may have to inter. 'It is a serious point. It’s a matter of common decency that when people are buried in consecrated ground they expect their remains not to be disturbed except in truly exceptional circumstances.’ According to a parliamentary submission by the Archbishop’s Council, the HS2 line will pass through three consecrated burial grounds. Tory backbencher Sir Tony Baldry said: 'It's a matter of common decency that when people are buried in consecrated ground they expect their remains not to be disturbed in truly exceptional circumstances' The expansion of Euston Station in North London will require more than 30,000 graves to be exhumed at St James’ Gardens, an 18th-century burial ground. And the remains of 2,600 people will have to be exhumed from a 12th-century graveyard in Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, to make way for the line, along with remains beneath Park Street in Birmingham where a new terminal is being built. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Throughout the development of HS2, burial grounds have been avoided as far as practicable. ‘We understand that the removal of human remains to enable HS2 to progress is a sensitive and emotive issue, which is why this issue is specifically dealt with in the Hybrid Bill and why HS2 Ltd recently published a paper setting out how it would deal with affected burial sites along the route’. A Church of England spokesman said: ‘In terms of “opposition”, the Church of England is not opposing HS2 per se, rather we are petitioning for a technical change to the Bill.’ Other high-profile objectors have complained that the high-speed link will cause ‘intolerable noise’. A string of aristocratic families, including Earl Spencer and Lord Rothschild, are among almost 2,000 petitioners lobbying Parliament to stop the controversial scheme going ahead in its current form. They have joined a chorus of protest from other campaigners who argue that the line will hit property prices, carve up Britain’s waterways and threaten countryside idylls. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission has also entered a petition. It demands  the Government backtrack on powers allowing constructors to disturb war memorials and First World War graves, without informing the Commission.","Church want 'ecclesiastical safeguards' introduced before HS2 bill is passed .

"By . Sian Boyle . Shift: New NHS chief executive Simon Stevens will urge more treatment of patients in their communities . The new boss of the National Health Service is calling for the return of cottage hospitals. Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said Britain had suffered from too much centralisation. In a major speech next week, he will urge more treatment of patients within their communities and a move away from the large impersonal hospitals which currently dominate the country’s health landscape. The move would be a major U-turn on the health policies of recent governments. Mr Stevens said that British hospitals had become some of the worst in western Europe and that the NHS should look to other countries for ways to improve the healthcare system. He said: ‘A number of other countries have found it possible to run viable local hospitals serving smaller communities than sometimes we think are sustainable in the NHS. Most of western Europe has hospitals which are able to serve their local communities, without everything having to be centralised.’ Cottage hospitals were originally envisioned as smaller buildings in communities which stopped people having to travel long distances for treatment in larger hospitals where they were all but anonymous. Instead, they would be treated locally. In recent years, many have been closed or phased out in favour of huge general hospitals which, it is argued, can be run more efficiently with economies of scale. Critics claim patients are swallowed up by the system and in many cases do not receive care that is sufficiently designed to meet their needs as an individual. Mr Stevens said the NHS needed to abandon its fixation with ‘mass centralisation’ and instead invest in community services to care for an ageing population. He also revealed that he felt Labour’s waiting time target culture had become an ‘impediment’ to care in many cases. Mr Stevens, a 47-year-old Briton, gave up a lucrative private healthcare job in America to work for the NHS in the £211,000-a year-role, for which he is taking a voluntary ten per cent pay cut. Poisoned chalice: The NHS top job saw Mr Stevens's predecessor dubbed 'the man with no shame' He will give a major speech next Wednesday laying out his vision for the organisation. The job is regarded in some quarters as a poisoned chalice. His predecessor, Sir David Nicholson, was dubbed the ‘man with no shame’ over his refusal to take responsibility for various NHS scandals, most damagingly the neglect of patients at Mid Staffordshire NHS trust. Mr Stevens said he believes the biggest question facing the NHS is how best to support older people, pointing out figures which show that two-thirds of hospital patients are over retirement age – yet services are not designed around their needs. Condemning the lack of ‘dignity and compassion’ with which vulnerable older patients are treated, Mr Stevens told the Telegraph that  care failings often occurred because systems were not designed around their needs, and called for local services to be expanded. ‘You cannot have a modern health service that is not treating older patients with dignity and compassion, supporting them at home and ensuring targeted prevention [of ill health],’ he said. Vulnerable patients are frequently ending up in hospital because they had not received basic help when they needed it, resulting in falls and other avoidable incidents, he suggested.","New NHS England chief executive will urge more community treatment .

"By . Sian Boyle . It appears to promote the idea that women can’t park. But officials hope they won’t be complaining when it means they get a prime spot in the centre of town. These extra-large parking spaces have been created in a £60million scheme to make Seoul, in South Korea, more female friendly. Women only: A £60m scheme in Seoul, South Korea, has designated parking bays for women only, which are marked with pink outlines and a figure wearing a skirt . The spaces, dubbed ‘she-spots’, are longer and wider – 8ft 2.5in rather than 7ft 6.5in – than standard and are marked with bright pink outlines and a female logo. They will also receive better lighting and be placed closer to shops. The authorities say they created the spaces for safety reasons, and not because of women’s reversing skills. Though it is not clear whether men who park in the spots will incur a fine. The scheme in Seoul will also see . pavements resurfaced with a ‘slightly spongy material’ that makes them . easier to walk on in high heels. As part of the effort, around 7,000 new toilets just for women will also be installed across the city. Some South Koreans welcomed the news, particularly as the spots will be located near shopping mall elevators and escalators. But others reacted angrily. The measures have sparked accusations of sexism similar to that which officials in the German town of Triberg were met with in 2012 when they introduced a similar programme. The Assistant Mayor for Women and Family Affairs Cho Eun-hee told the Korea Times newspaper: ‘It is like adding a female touch to a universal design and make things more comfortable for women.’ China, Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia, Austria and Italy also have women-only parking spots. Australia doesn’t have spots reserved for women but they do have ‘family’ car parking spots in shopping malls for parents with infants. Triberg Mayor, Gallus Strobel, said he was accused of ‘male pig-headedness’ because the female spots were better lit and wider, while the male versions were flanked by concrete pillars and could only be reversed into. Triberg’s Mayor, Gallus Strobel, told Der Spiegel that two spaces in the town would be too difficult for women because they required drivers to reverse diagonally between a pillar and a wall. ‘I am happy, and it looks like we’ve hit a raw nerve in society,’ he said. ‘It’s been a great marketing gimmick. Women can come here and prove me wrong, and while they’re at it they can see the town’s attractions.’","Extra-large female-friendly parking spaces created in Seoul, South Korea .

"By . Laura Clark . and Sian Boyle . Spending watchdogs are to investigate claims that private colleges are letting thousands of students accept taxpayer-backed loans without turning up to classes. Up to 3,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have been claiming the money to study without proper proof of residence in the UK, it is alleged. One college, dubbed the ‘cashpoint’ by students, was yesterday said to be running classes which were largely empty. Allegations: Spending watchdogs are to investigate claims that private colleges are letting thousands of students accept taxpayer-backed loans without turning up to classes (file picture) The London School of Science and Technology (LSST) in Wembley is accused of recruiting students off the street and ignoring a lack of basic skills to put more of them on its books. It is claimed that in one ‘ghost’ class, not a single youngster had turned up 35 minutes after the lesson had started. ‘They go to the gym or the pub, or anywhere they like, but they don’t show up to class,’ LSST student Krisztian Muhasci, 34, told the Mail. A whistleblower told how a Romanian student described her approach. ‘She said “I get on a plane, I come to London. I stay for a week or two, and then I go back home and I get my student loan, maintenance, and I make more money than I would [in Romania]”.’ Chairman, Margaret Hodge, of the Public Accounts Committee, said she was 'shocked' at the claims . The Commons Public Accounts Committee has asked the National Audit Office to investigate the possible misuse of public funds by private colleges. It follows Coalition reforms which allowed students at such institutions to claim maintenance loans and grants worth up to £11,000 a year. Colleges can be handed £6,000 in tuition fees for each student they enrol. Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said she was ‘pretty shocked’ at the claims. ‘We’re talking about many hundreds of millions, if not a couple of billions, in taxpayer money which was set aside to support higher education,’ she said. Her remarks follow an investigation into the LSST by the Guardian, which allegedly found some classes had attendance rates of below 40 per cent. Over the past three years, its students have received more than £25million while the college has benefited from £6.5million paid to it in tuition fees. A wider investigation into private colleges by the Department for Business is said to have found that 3,000 Romanian and Bulgarian students have been claiming loans without proof of residence. LSST chief executive Syed Zaidi denied the allegations, saying that the college’s admissions procedures were ‘undoubtedly robust’. Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: ‘Students and the taxpayers who provide funding deserve to get a quality service. I am determined to make sure that they do. Where standards are not being met we are taking action.’","Private colleges allegedly letting students claim loans without attending .

"By . Sian Boyle . Holidaymakers in Majorca will be fined £500 if they dare to walk the streets in just their bikinis or trunks. Island authorities have implemented a ban on wearing bathing costumes away from the beach or poolside. The new regulations come in this month after workers in bars, restaurants and shops complained that they were fed up with having to serve under-dressed holidaymakers. Authorities in Majorca, pictured, have implemented a ban on wearing bathing costumes away from the beach or poolside. Holidaymakers who are caught flouting the rules will be fined £500 . Palma city council’s ‘Ordenanza Civica’, otherwise known as the Good Citizen Plan, is aimed at both tourists and locals. Under a section titled ‘Etiquette’, it says anyone ‘devoid of superior parts of clothing’ in roads not immediately adjacent to the beach will be fined. Other proposals also include the banning of glass bottles from the beach and fining cyclists who use the pavement. The city’s deputy mayor Alvaro Gijon said the swimwear ban was meant to preserve ‘harmony and civility’. He added that he did not know ‘of any upscale resort town’ that allows the practice of wearing swimwear in public. The rules are the latest developments in Majorca – long the destination for millions of British holidaymakers – aimed at making the island more upmarket. Last year officials introduced a ban on drinking alcohol in public, and Mr Gijon said he wanted to transform Majorca’s image by upgrading hotels and restaurants. Anyone 'devoid of superior parts of clothing' in roads not immediately adjacent to the beach will be fined by local authorities as part of the new rules which are aimed at making the island more upmarket . He also said he wanted to target the four-mile Playa de Palma strip just outside the capital, banning drinking there and turning it into a destination for gastronomy and sports facilities rather than drinking buckets of sangria on sun loungers. Elsewhere in Spain, a similar bikini-ban was introduced in Barcelona in 2011, aimed at tourists who wander off the beach and onto the streets in bikinis and trunks. The city hall voted to ban ‘nudity or virtual nudity in public places’ and limit swimwear to swimming pools, beaches, adjacent roads and beach walks. Those who flout the ban are fined up to £245 (300 euros), while nudists face an even tougher fine of up to £408 (500 euros). In Italy two seaside towns also introduced fines penalising those who flash too much flesh. In Vietri Sul mare and Castellammare di Stabia, both in the Campania region of Southern Italy, the town mayors passed bans on ‘very skimpy clothes’ in 2010. Anyone deemed showing an unreasonable amount of bare skin on streets and in public spaces faces a fine of up to £408 (500 euros) – essential for upholding ‘the area’s image’, according to one town spokesman.","Local authorities will fine anyone who is caught on the street in swimwear .

"By . Sian Boyle . Coca-Cola has come under fire over a £20million anti-obesity campaign it is running in 70 parks this summer. Thousands of families will be urged to take part in free sports sessions such as tennis, rounders and Zumba from Friday as part of the Coca-Cola Zero ParkLives. But nutrition campaigners claim it is an ‘obscene’ attempt to distract attention from the company’s part in fuelling Britain’s obesity epidemic. Launch: Wayne and Coleen Rooney pose together to promote Coke Zero in this 2006 advert . Earlier this month, public health officials warned that children are consuming around 40 per cent more sugar than is recommended. Public Health England said soft drinks were the chief culprit, providing the largest source of sugar in the diets of those aged four to 18. Drinks such as Coca-Cola, with nine teaspoons of sugar per can, accounted for 30 per cent of added sugar intake for those aged 11 to 18, the National Diet and Nutrition Survey found. Coca Cola's Coke Zero, a Diet Coke for men in a black can: The food industry lobby has been granted dozens of meetings with ministers since 2010 . Yesterday Dr Aseem Malhotra, . cardiologist and science director for campaign group Action on Sugar, . branded Coca-Cola’s parks scheme ‘a really disingenuous stunt’. Dr Malhotra said: ‘They are trying to deflect attention from their own part in creating an obesity epidemic, which has been fuelled almost entirely by  rising calorie consumption.’ He added that ‘obscene’ attempts by firms to associate themselves with active lifestyles could encourage the public to consume more unhealthy products, wrongly assuming that small amounts of activity would be enough to balance it out. Wayne and Coleen Rooney helped to launch Coca-Cola Zero in 2006. The parks project bearing its name will see activities such as basketball, hula-hooping and t’ai chi in London,  Birmingham and Newcastle, with plans to expand it to more cities in the future. The Coca-Cola Zero ParkLives project is the latest offshoot of the controversial ‘Public Health Responsibility Deal’, under which the food and drink industries can effectively regulate themselves. The Daily Mail revealed in February how the food industry lobby had been granted dozens of meetings with  ministers since 2010, while health campaigners have been kept at arm’s length. Coca-Cola has stated that in accordance with its marketing code, the fitness programme will not be marketed at children under 12. It will offer free sports sessions and coaching for families and young adults. Working out: Thousands of families will be urged to take part in free sports sessions such as tennis, rounders and Zumba, like the class pictured, from Friday as part of the Coca-Cola Zero ParkLives. File picture . Jon Woods, general manager of Coca-Cola Great Britain, said: ‘We know that companies get to grow in a market if they stay close to their customers. Obesity is a great concern for our consumers – 61 per cent of adults are overweight and obese, as are 33 per cent of children. ‘We want to play a more productive role in finding solutions to obesity. ‘Historically, we would have shied away from this but we are taking a more proactive approach. This is about calories in and calories out and getting the energy balance right.’","Coca-Cola Zero ParkLives project will offer free sessions from Friday .

Temperatures are forecast to peak at a rather warm 20C (68F), right on cue for Bank Holiday Monday. Yesterday glorious sunshine sent the average UK temperature creeping up from a cool 12C (54F) earlier in the week to 18C (64F) in many parts of the country, including Aberdeen, while Bristol enjoyed highs of 16C (61F).

Figures from Asda suggested the . sunshine inspired a wave of impromptu barbecues, with sales of sausages . and equipment expected to triple those of April. The fine weather was not evenly spread, however, according to a forecaster from the Met Office. 'Large . swathes of England, Wales and southern parts of Scotland had good . spells of sunshine but further north and west there was thicker cloud . producing outbreaks of rain,' he said. 'Today . there is likely to be  an east/west split with the best  sunshine in . the south-eastern parts  of England from London up to  Lincoln, and . temperatures will reach 20 or 21C (68-70F).' Outbreaks of rain from the west to the east are expected to arrive in the evening and could carry on into Tuesday. Yesterday, . with no work till Tuesday and clear blue skies and temperatures nudging . the mid teens in the South and East, children and adults were out . playing in the parks and flocking to the coasts.

A couple take a ride in a kayak, enjoying meandering along the River Cam in Cambridge . But the change in weather, while almost universally welcome, has come with warnings. Nature lovers have begged holidaymakers not to get too close to huge but harmless basking sharks which are moving close to beaches on the West Country coastline. The docile monsters of the deep, which can reach 30ft in length and weigh up to eight tonnes, drift round just below the surface with their vast 4ft wide jaws wide open as a net to catch millions of microscopic plankton, their staple food. Shark fins have been spotted cleaving the water, with this spring's first sightings close to the shore at Porthcurno and near Mount's Bay in Penzance, Cornwall. Today wildlife tour operator Marine Discovery, based in Penzance, urged excited and curious holidaymakers to take great care when they spot basking shark cruising lazily in shallow water. 'We're now getting into the time of year when basking sharks can be found feeding off the Cornish coast and it's fantastic to see them,' said a spokesman. 'But it's important to remember that they need to be approached carefully so as not to disturb their natural behaviour. 'If a shark thrashes its tail and dives or stops feeding and dives, then it is likely you have disturbed it. If this happens learn from the mistake and try not to repeat it.'

Sand between the toes: Jude Adams, three, and his sister Seren, eight months, enjoy the sun on Bournemouth beach . In Bristol people enjoyed an interactive temporary art installation, the Park and Slide project in the city centre . Meanwhile, in Cambridge, university officials have urged students to boycott a notorious annual booze-up today in the city's Jesus Green park. 'Caesarian Sunday' attracts thousands of students every year who dress up and play drinking games. But locals and visitors have been upset as the historic riverside park has been left littered with rubbish, empty bottles and vomit. After years of complaints university officials are calling on students to shun today's event. A University spokesman said: 'The Colleges will be asking students preferably not to attend but if they do to be considerate of others and avoid any behaviour which may cause offence.' The three-day forecast: Temperatures will increase tomorrow, but a band of rain moving in from the west will gradually cover the country and sit there for the rest of the week . But with a fine afternoon and evening expected, it may be difficult to dissuade Britons from making the most of the springtime sun. Calum McColl, a forecaster with the Met Office, told MailOnline that for much of England and Wales 'there's some good weather to be had.' Although cloud is still overshadowing central and northern parts of the country, many inland areas will enjoy temperatures of up to 15C even as far north as Sheffield. The best of the sun will be in the South and the East, particularly around coastal areas, which will nevertheless be slighter cooler under the influence of the sea breeze. Overnight the clear skies over these areas will lead to a frost and a chilly morning, but May Day bank holiday temperatures tomorrow will then increase up to 18C in London and surrounding areas, with much of the rest of the country also enjoying a 'pretty good day'. However, rain will start moving into western parts over the course of the day, bringing with it colder temperatures and heavier cloud cover. 'There's a little bit of a change coming into western areas,' said Mr McColl. 'There is a band of rain coming through.' By Tuesday, rain will advance across much of the country, with summery weather holding out only in the far west, in an outlook that looks likely to persist for the rest of the week.","Britain basks in temperatures reaching the mid-teens and clear skies across the South and East .

"By . Sian Boyle . Usually the worst kind of distraction on the putting green is a well-timed sneeze from your playing partner. But golfers at one golf club are having to contend with a very different kind of rat-like cunning. Startled players at the North Weald club near Harlow in Essex have reported seeing a giant rodent lurking around the eighth hole. On the run: This capybara was spotted lurking around the eighth hole at North Weald Golf Club in Essex . On further investigation the 4ft-long creature was identified as a capybara – the world’s largest type of rodent which is usually found grazing the plains of South America. Assistant club manager Angus Lloyd-Skinner said: ‘A group reported seeing a giant rodent on the eighth and when we went to investigate we saw this huge creature the size of a small dog. ‘We didn’t know what it was until one of our members identified it. But we have no idea what it is doing on the course.’ At first it was thought the capybara had escaped from a zoo or private collection, or had been dumped by a bored pet owner. Large size: Usually found in South America, capybaras can grow up to 2ft tall and weigh as much as 140lbs . Now Rob Dixon, manager at Ashlyns Farm Shop in Epping, has confirmed it is missing a male capybara. He said: ‘We keep on trying to catch it, but as soon as we try and catch it,  it’s moved on or it jumps in the river and  shoots off. ‘Next time we’ve got to get a vet out and try and tranquillise it. ‘They run away from humans – they’re quite shy. They’re not like a rat, they’re almost like a big hamster.’ Distant relatives of guinea pigs, capybara are grazing animals native to countries such as Argentina and Venezuela, where they are farmed for their meat and skins. They can grow up to 2ft tall and weigh as much as 140lbs.","Giant rodent spotted lurking around eighth hole at North Weald Golf Club .

"By . Sara Smyth . and Sian Boyle . It's not the exotic charms of a modern-day Mata Hari that will make a good secret agent, but feminine characteristics such as understanding emotions . Women spies have often been depicted as practised seducers – able to prise secrets from defenceless men with their devastating charm. But, according to one female intelligence officer, there’s a rather more ordinary reason why women make better spies than men – they appear less threatening. So it’s not the exotic charms of a modern-day Mata Hari that will make a good secret agent, but feminine characteristics such as understanding emotions. They are the qualities that make women ‘bloody good spies’ a female MI6 officer said yesterday as part of a drive by the Security Service to recruit more women. The spy, speaking anonymously, said working mothers made particularly good secret agents. She said: ‘Being a mother and a spy can also be an advantage because it enables you to connect with a whole range of people from terrorists to political leaders. ‘I’m less of a threat than a single female,’ said the intelligence officer who is married with young children. ‘They, the terrorist, have mothers, sisters, daughters.’ After taking six months maternity leave when she had her children, she said life as a working mother is difficult. ‘It is amazing that anybody manages to balance life and work with small children.’ She added that the thing that upsets her the most is hearing her children cry when dropping them off at nursery. She said her gender has been helpful as she worked to protect the world from the threat of terrorism or nuclear war. ‘I have successfully countered proliferation,’ she added. ‘I’ve made the world a safer place through some of the jobs I have done and the agents I have run.‘ . It is always interesting, there is . massive diversity. You can be covering completely different geographic . locations over a career. There’s strong moral reward to it.’ The spy said life at MI6 is far from the glamorous world depicted in James Bond films, starring Daniel Craig and Judi Dench . The spy said life at MI6 is far from the glamorous world depicted in James Bond films. ‘SIS is a lot more responsible and it is a lot more connected to the rest of government. It is a lot more about teamwork and not just Bond talks to Q and gets kit.’ Asked if she has ever been armed with an . explosive pen, she said: ‘No, though I have had pens that explode on a . plane because of cabin pressure.’ Two high profile women, Dame Stella Rimington (left) and Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller (right) have reached the top in the spying game . Throughout the decades the idea of the female spy has captured the imagination. Mata Hari was an exotic dancer and courtesan who was convicted of being a spy, and executed by firing squad in France under charges of espionage during the First World War. Two high profile women have reached the top in the spying game. Dame Stella Rimington was director general of MI5 in 1992 and used her knowledge to become a successful thriller author. Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller was also a director general for MI5. Dame Eliza revealed she was nearly thrown out of a pub after being mistaken for a prostitute while training to be a spy.","MI6 officer says women make better spies as they appear less threatening .

"By . Sian Boyle . The BBC has been forced to defend spending thousands of pounds putting up staff in a luxury £279-a-night hotel while filming the popular countryside programme Lambing Live. During filming for the third series, the entire 65-strong team set up camp in a lavish country house hotel which boasts a spa, two golf courses, a gym, swimming pool and tennis courts. Production crew, including presenters Kate Humble and Adam Henson, stayed 21 miles away from the Scottish filming location at the plush Dalmahoy Country Club while the farmer and his staff tended their sheep around the clock at their farm. Dalmahoy Country Club: The BBC has been forced to defend itself after putting up the 65-strong Lambing Live team set up camp at the lavish hotel . Last night critics accused the BBC of extravagance - questioning why they needed such a huge crew and why the production team had not been booked into cheaper B&B accommodation nearer to the site of filming. Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The BBC has to get the best deal for licence fee payers when purchasing accommodation. The use of a luxury country club as the BBC’s accommodation of choice appears to be a lavish expense at licence fee payers’ expense.’ Alex Hogg, chairman of campaign group the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, said: ‘I don’t live far from where the latest Lambing Live was filmed for the BBC. Lambing Live presenters Kate Humble and Adam Henson were among the 65 staff who stayed at the plush Dalmahoy Country Club . ‘How many BBC employees were needed to run some cables round a lambing shed? A dozen maybe? Twenty max? Almost 70 people were used and they stayed in some very exclusive country club. It must be tough being the Beeb.’ Margaret Thain, of the nearby Meadows B&B, said: ‘I would have loved to have people staying at my B&B, but I am probably not as exclusive as the Dalmahoy.’ The BBC also decided not to stay at the closest hotel, the Peebles Hydro Hotel - despite a standard room costing almost £40 less than the Dalmahoy Country Club's standard rate. Last night the BBC was forced to defend its spending on the programme and said . A spokeswoman from BBC factual TV, said the Corporation paid a discounted fee for the rooms. She said: . ‘Around 65 crew in total required accommodation in Scotland throughout . the week of Lambing Live, which is typical for a live broadcast over four nights. ‘The crew stayed at the Dalmahoy Marriott, paying £58 a night. This was the closest hotel to the filming location that was able to accommodate this number. ‘This was the most economically sensible choice as the hotel offered a competitive rate for a group booking, with a reduction of around 50% less than their standard rate. This was substantially less than other hotels in the area. ‘The BBC was also able to save on transport costs by having all crew staying at the same hotel, meaning they could be bussed directly to the farm each day. ‘This hotel was also chosen because it is situated on a main road, which is necessary in case of bad weather.’ The Lambing Live format has proved a hit since it went out in 2010, with the first series pulling in an average of 2.6 million viewers.","Production crew, including presenters Kate Humble and Adam Henson, stayed 21 miles away from the Scottish filming location .

"By . Ben Spencer . and Sian Boyle . and Inderdeep Bains . Cats have passed TB to humans for the first  time in an outbreak feared to have been caused by badgers. Two people from the same household are being treated for bovine tuberculosis after they caught  the disease from their kitten. Two other cat owners have been infected with a dormant form of TB. Nine cats were infected in the Home Counties in a matter of weeks. Cats have passed TB to humans for the first  time in an outbreak feared to have been caused by badgers. Nine of the animals were infected in the Home Counties in a matter of weeks - including 18-month-old Milhouse (pictured), which has run away . Six were put down or have died, two have survived, but one, an 18-month-old tabby called Milhouse, has run away. Seven of the cats had bite wounds, which vets say probably came from fighting with badgers, who are prolific carriers of bovine TB. In recent years, scientists have warned that cats could spread TB to their owners, but these are believed to be the first documented cases in the world. The infection was passed to each of the patients during an unprecedented outbreak of the disease among cats in Newbury, Berkshire, last year. The patients, whose diagnoses were revealed last night, are responding to treatment, according to Public Health England, which classified the risk of further transmissions as ‘very low’. The alarm was raised by vet Carl Gorman after a series of cats – including his own pet, Milhouse – started displaying chronic lung conditions and suspicious wounds. TB in cats is rare, with barely 25 cases seen each year in the UK. Last year’s Newbury outbreak was unprecedented. Dr Gorman, clinical director of the Falkland Veterinary Clinic in Newbury, said the disease had its roots in an outbreak of bovine TB among cows on the outskirts of the town. Speaking exclusively to the Daily Mail last night, he said: ‘My colleague saw a cat which had a lesion that wasn’t healing so we looked for TB. ‘There were cases dotted around Newbury with a cluster of cases in and around Greenham Common. ‘It’s quite unusual for cats to get TB but not unheard of, but it is quite rare for a cluster of cats like this to get it.’ Public Health England officials said the two patients who had been infected by the TB bacteria mycobacterium bovis were undergoing treatment. Two other owners were diagnosed with ‘latent TB’, which means they have been exposed to the infection but are not displaying symptoms. Dr Dilys Morgan, of Public Health England, said: ‘These are the first documented cases of cat-to-human transmission. ‘Although PHE has assessed the risk of people catching this infection from infected cats as being very low, we are recommending that household and close contacts of cats with confirmed M. bovis infection should be assessed and receive public health advice. ‘It’s important to remember that this was a very unusual cluster of TB in domestic cats.’ Bovine TB has ravaged the British farming industry, with farms forced to slaughter 30,000 cows with the disease each year. Above, the bacteria that causes TB . Mike Mandelbaum, chief executive of the charity TB Alert, said: ‘In the UK we are a nation of cat lovers, so this may prove quite shocking for people who may now look at their pets in a different light. ‘Although I would stress that the risk of catching TB from a cat is likely to remain very low, this is a stark reminder that TB is still a problem in the UK today, with almost 9,000 people developing it last year.’ Dr Gorman said the two people with active TB were infected by a kitten. He added: ‘This cat was quite young and was suffering from an open sore which makes the risk of infection greater. TB is a serious infection which affects the lungs. It can also affect other parts of the body - such as the bones and kidneys - and can cause meningitis. Some cases can be prevented with the BGC vaccine but it is currently only given to people who are thought to be at high risk. The vaccine is rarely given to people over the age of 16 and never to those over 35 as it doesn't work very well in adults. In children and young adults the vaccine is 70 to 80 per cent effective against the most severe forms of TB, such as TB meningitis. It is less effective in preventing respiratory disease which is the more common form in adults. Source: NHS Choices . ‘Before the pet was diagnosed with TB, the owners may have been cleaning the wound without wearing gloves or taking other precautions.’ Six of the infected cats lived in homes within 250 yards of each other on a housing estate near Greenham Common. The other three lived within three miles. Some 39 people who had come into contact with the cats were offered TB screening, including Dr Gorman, his wife Claire and four children. Their cat Milhouse was one of those infected – and has since disappeared. Dr Gorman, 52, who has three dogs and four other cats, said: ‘Milhouse was sat on my lap one day and I felt a lump on his leg. We had already had a few cases so I had him checked. He was responding well to treatment but has since gone missing.’ He fears the tabby was killed in an accident and says it is unlikely Milhouse could be spreading the infection further. Bovine TB has ravaged the British farming industry, with farms forced to slaughter 30,000 cows with the disease each year. Badgers are blamed for accelerating its spread, and the Government is trialling a controversial cull of the animals to limit the problem. Professor Noel Smith, of the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, said: ‘Testing of nearby herds revealed a small number of infected cattle with the same strain of M. bovis as the cats. ‘However, direct contact of the cats with these cattle was unlikely considering their roaming ranges. The most likely source of infection is infected wildlife, but cat-to-cat transmission cannot be ruled out.’ Cattle herds with confirmed cases of bovine TB in the area have been placed under movement restrictions to prevent the spread of disease.","Two people have been diagnosed with active TB while two have latent TB .

One of the teenage victims of the Zanzibar acid attack has spoken of her determination not to let the ordeal ruin her life. Katie Gee suffered 30 per cent burns and could have been blinded after being drenched in the unprovoked attack by two men. Her friend Kirstie Trup was also  injured when the 18-year-olds were  targeted while on a three-week trip working as volunteer teachers on the mainly Muslim island. ‘The pain was…so severe and the thought of being scarred so horrific that I even asked [someone] to shoot me,’ Miss Gee said. ‘Thankfully, my stubborn streak ensures that I will not give in, if only to prevent the cowards who attempted to destroy my life from winning. 'And they will not.’ Describing the attack, Miss Gee, of Hampstead, North London, said: ‘The acid had already stripped away several layers of skin from my thighs and  stomach, leaving them looking swollen, indented and white. ‘It was a horrific transformation that seemed to unfold in slow motion in front of my eyes. 'It is only recently that I have come to terms with looking in the  mirror and not feeling totally miserable and asking, “Why me? Why did life have to be so unfair?” ‘I draw strength from the love of my family, friends and my dog, Caesar, who my family bought in January.’ Miss Gee told how she took a selfie before heading out for dinner with Miss Trup in Zanzibar City. The image on her mobile phone was to be the last ‘as I used to be’. Shortly afterwards, they were assaulted by one of two men riding a moped. Scroll down for video .

"By . Sian Boyle . The final survivor of the elite Bletchley Park codebreaking team that cracked Adolf Hitler's secret messages during the Second World War has died aged 93. Raymond 'Jerry' Roberts - who helped crack the system carrying messages between Hitler and his top generals – died at his home in Liphook, Hampshire on Tuesday following a short illness. Captain Roberts was the last remaining founder member of a team which cracked the German High Command’s Tunny code, and in doing so shortened the Second World War by at least two years. Bletchley Park codebreaker Raymond 'Jerry' Roberts, who helped smash the German high command's Tunny system, has died aged 93 . The German Tunny system was used by Hitler, Mussolini and other high ranking generals during the Second World War, and was made up of four times as many encryption wheels as the famous Enigma machine. Last year, to mark the significance of Captain Robert’s work, he received an MBE and a set of commemorative stamps issued in his name. He told the BBC: ‘This was intelligence gold dust, really top level stuff. [We cracked the] movements of troops, not just divisions or regiments but of [whole] armies.’ He also described seeing the messages between Hitler and his generals and says a landmark moment in his career was 'seeing the signature come up - of 'Adolf, spacer, Hitler, spacer, fuhrer, spacer'.' 'A very simple signature; I imagine the person who received the signature stood up and saluted.' The rebuilt Tunny machine at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park and a wartime photograph of Captain Raymond 'Jerry' Roberts, one of the four man team who cracked the code . The highly-secretive work at the Bletchley Park listening post, is believed to have shortened the length of the war by at least two years . Capt Roberts joined Bletchley Park as a cryptographer and linguist in 1941 and was one of four founder members of the Testery, an elite unit named after the man leading it, Ralph Tester, which cracked the Tunny code - making it possible to read Hitler's messages during the war. The Testery team, which grew to 118 by the end of the war, managed to reverse-engineer the Tunny, which had 12 encryption wheels to the Enigma machine's three, described by Bletchley Park as 'an incredible feat of dedication'. The spokeswoman said: 'Jerry came to Bletchley Park straight from university but they were all in unchartered territory. It was new ground for everybody.' The intelligence gathered at Bletchley Park is credited with providing strategic information that was passing between the top level commanders and is believed to have shortened the war by two years and helped to save millions of lives. Captain Roberts worked at Bletchley Park until 1945 before moving to the War Crimes Investigation Unit for two years, followed by a 50-year career in marketing and research. Honoured: Captain Roberts receives his MBE from the Queen at Buckingham Palace last year . Later in life he became a tireless ambassador . for the memory of those who had served in secret, and spent years . campaigning for acknowledgement of his colleagues, including Alan . Turing, who broke the naval Enigma. He argued the Testery as a whole should be honoured for its work - including Bill Tutte who broke the Tunny system to help shorten the war; and Tommy Flowers, who designed and built the Colossus, which sped up some stages of the breaking of Tunny traffic. Their stream of intelligence proved vital in the D-Day invasion and helped save many lives. The codebreaker, originally from Liphook in Hampshire, worked at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, until the end of the Second World War before spending two years at the War Crimes Investigation Unit, and then moved on to a 50-year career in marketing and research. The rebuilt Tunny machine now sits in the new Tunny Gallery at The National Museum of Computing . The intelligence war waging in a quiet corner of Buckinghamshire was to be decisive in the Allied effort to win the Second World War. Station X - known now as Bletchley Park - was the hub of Britain's code-backing effort, where hugely talented mathematicians and inventors worked tirelessly to give the armed forces a crucial helping-hand. As Winston Churchill himself made clear, the accurate information which flowed from Bletchley Park, at a rate which sometimes reached 6,000 messages a day, saved lives and gave Britain a crucial edge in battle. Codenamed Ultra the intelligence provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort. Sir Harry Hinsley, a Bletchley veteran and the official historian of British Intelligence during the Second World War, said that Ultra shortened the war by two to four years and that the outcome of the war would have been uncertain without it. Captain Roberts was one of the four founder members of the Testery in October 1941, along with team leader Ralph Tester, Major Denis Oswald and Captain Peter Ericsson. After a few months of breaking of a Double Playfair cipher system used by the German Military Police, the unit was tasked with breaking the German High Command’s most top-level code Tunny. Despite being Adolf Hitler’s most secret code system and having 12 wheels against well-known 3 wheel Enigma, tens of thousands of Tunny messages were intercepted by the British and broken at Bletchley Park. By the end of the War, the Testery had grown to 9 cryptanalysts, a team of 24 ATS, a total staff of 118, organised in three shifts working round the clock.","Captain Raymond Roberts was last survivor of crucial codebreaking team .

"By . Steve Hopkins . An incredibly rare Ferrari racing car which won a string of famous races in the 1950s has been tipped to set a world record by selling for £10million. The Ferrari 375 Plus was among the quickest and most powerful racing cars of its time, notching up victories at Le Mans and Silverstone in 1954. Just four racing versions of the car were ever made, while one road model was custom built for the King of Belgium. The Ferrari 375 Plus was among the quickest and most powerful racing cars of its time, notching up victories at Le Mans and Silverstone in 1954 . The car's most famous victory was in the Carrera Pan-Americana road race through Mexico at the hands of Italian Umberto Maglioli who averaged 107mph . The supercharged red motor, which boasts a 4.9-litre 330bhp V12 engine and a top speed of 175mph, was entrusted to only the best and bravest drivers of the time. Its most famous victory was in the Carrera Pan-Americana road race through Mexico at the hands of Italian ace Umberto Maglioli. The Italian star drove the 2,000-mile course at an incredible average of 107mph and during one five hour period towards the end of the race he averaged 150mph - almost flat out. The 375 became so feared on the . racecourse that in France it earned the nickname Le Monstre - the . monster - while in Britain it was called the Fearsome Four-Nine. The Ferrari 375 Plus boasts a 4.9-lire 330bhp V12 engine and a top speed of 175mph, and right, fittingly, the speed machine has a fighter jet like cockpit . The car has a sordid post-racing history; first it was sold to a private collector then it was taken and sold to someone else without his knowledge . The Ferrari races to victory in the 1954 Le Mans race while being hotly pursued, and another car can be seen wedged over the banks of the track just behind it . But by 1958 it was obsolete and was bought by American car collector Karl Kleve for around £12,000 in today’s money. Mr . Kleve had planned to swap the car’s huge V12 but it was forgotten about . and fell into disrepair outside Mr Kleve’s home in Cincinatti, Ohio. The engine, its cover, the drum brakes, the boot lid and doors had been stripped from the motor and kept in a barn. The Ferrari team mechanics make last minute checks before the 1954 Le Mans race, while onlookers take pictures and watch the action unfold on the track . The car languished in a wooded area for almost 20 years - and was so unloved that a tree grew through its empty engine bay. Without Mr Kleve’s knowing, the car was removed from his land in 1989 and sold to a French buyer for about £30,000. Mr Kleve reported the car stolen and it was impounded in Belgium where it was destined for an exhibition. Authorities concluded the sale had been in good faith and in 1990 it was released and sold to Ferrari importer Jacques Swaters, a close friend of Enzo Ferrari. The car languished in a wooded area for almost 20 years - and was so unloved that a tree grew through its empty engine bay, before it was fully restored . Mr Swaters then set about restoring . the once-great motor to its former glory, reuniting it with original . parts which it had been separated from when taken from Cincinnati. It is now being sold with no reserve by Mr Swaters’ family following his death three years ago. The car is tipped to fetch £10million, which if realised would break the world record for a racing Ferrari at auction. Philip Kantor, motoring expert at auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'This is a very special car indeed. It is a works racing car which is rare in itself but on top of that only four racing models and one road version were ever built. This car is the first, and only four still remain. The winner of the auction, which will take place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in Chichester, West Sussex, on June 27 will also get surviving original body panels . The Ferrari has an undisputed chassis number and the car's authenticity has never been questioned say auctioneers . 'It has participated in some of the world’s greatest racing events driven by some of the world’s best drivers. 'Very importantly it has an undisputed chassis number - there is no other car in the world like it and its identity has never been called into question. In the 1990s it was beautifully restored by Jacques Swaters, a close friend of Enzo Ferrari, and it has since taken part in Le Mans Classic twice.

UK Vogue editor: Alexandra Shulman said readers can look in the mirror and get the real thing 'for free' The UK Vogue editor has argued against putting ‘real people’ on the cover of her magazine - because readers can look in the mirror and get the real thing ‘for free’. Alexandra Shulman, who has edited the publication since 1992, also said she was ‘fed up’ of questions about thin models and the fashion industry. She said: ‘People always say “why do you have thin models? That’s not what real people look like.” But nobody really wants to see a real person looking like a real person on the cover of Vogue. ‘I think Vogue is a magazine that’s all about fantasy to some extent and dreams, and an escape from real life. ‘People don’t want to buy a magazine like Vogue to see what they see when they look in the mirror. They can do that for free.’ The editor was interviewed on BBC Radio 2 by singer Lily Allen, who has previously spoken out against the media and fashion industries causing negative body image among women. On Vogue and the fashion industry, Ms Shulman said: ‘I guess a certain amount of defending comes with the job. The magazine does really well, so obviously some people like it and it’s not a real problem. Outspoken: The editor was interviewed by singer Lily Allen (pictured centre at London Fashion Week last month), who claims the media and fashion industries cause negative body image among women . Glossy magazines: Ms Shulman said she was 'fed up' of questions about thin models and the fashion industry . ‘I get fed up with having to deal with the question of why are models thin, that sort of bores me, but that’s the only thing really. ‘I do think designers should cut bigger and use bigger models on the catwalk. I’ve said it again and again. But there is much more diversity than there used to be, it is changing.’ 'People don’t want to buy a magazine like Vogue to see what they see when they look in the mirror. They can do that for free' Alexandra Shulman . She also described the Vogue cover images that sell the most copies, adding that the most popular ones were ‘broadly speaking…quite a middle view of what beauty is. 'Quite conventional, probably smiling, in a pretty dress; somebody looking very “lovely”. The most perfect girl next door.’ Next month’s cover star is Nigella Lawson, whose photographs were praised for their natural look. The popular TV chef appears on the front of April Vogue virtually make-up free.","Alexandra Shulman says readers can get real thing 'for free' in mirrors .

"By . Claire Ellicott . and Inderdeep Bains . and Sian Boyle . For Britain’s first Lottery-winning pub syndicate, the chance to safeguard their jackpot by investing with a well-known retired local accountant seemed like a sensible step. But furious villagers have now been told that millions of pounds of their winnings and other savings have been lost in the disastrous scheme. Police are investigating David Reeves, 68, after he confessed the losses to his clients, who are thought to include several members of the Tudor Tavern pub syndicate which won a £3.6million jackpot in 1997. Jackpot: Police are investigating David Reeves, 68, after he confessed the losses to his clients, thought to include several members of the Tudor Tavern pub syndicate (pictured) which won a £3.6million jackpot in 1997 . Last night angry villagers said they wanted answers and accused Reeves of losing their life savings and pensions in the failed scheme. One victim claimed that he even asked residents to give him more money so he could claw back their investments. It also emerged that Reeves is not registered with the Financial Conduct Authority – a requirement for anyone investing other people’s money. The 6ft 5in ex-policeman and former used car salesman handed himself in to police last weekend after leaving his home in East Preston, West Sussex. Pub: As well as members of the pub syndicate, other Lottery winners from the area are also thought to have been affected as well as local residents, from pensioners to businessmen. Above, the Tudor Tavern today . As well as members of the pub syndicate, other Lottery winners from the area are also thought to have been affected as well as local residents – from pensioners to wealthy businessmen – who simply wanted to invest money for the future. The sums handed over range from as little as a few thousand pounds to £1million, victims said. One businessman who believes he has lost money in the scheme said: ‘Around 80 people have been affected and have lost a lot of money. We’re talking several million pounds.’ The victim, who has known Reeves for several years but did not want to be named, added: ‘We’ve all had this letter. 'It basically says that he has lost everybody’s money and he is asking them to reinvest so he can try to claw it back again.’ A former client of Reeves said: ‘There are a lot of angry people in the village who are desperate for answers. It is not known if it’s just bad investments or if he’s done something underhand. He’s been investing in the American markets for years and has in the past made people money.’ Another former client added: ‘He’s been running this private investors’ group for years and years. People have lost their pensions and life savings.’ Reeves has not been seen since news of the losses broke last week, but angry villagers have been spotted approaching his rented detached bungalow looking for answers. Another victim said: ‘I haven’t been able to get hold of him since getting the letter. It looks like he’s gone to ground.’ Outrage: Last night villagers in East Preston accused Reeves of losing their life savings in the failed scheme . Reeves, who has been described as a recluse by neighbours, has lived in the village for 30 years. He retired as an accountant after being diagnosed with cancer. It is believed that he then operated a private investors’ club in which residents of the seaside village entrusted him with their life savings. A spokesman for Sussex police said: ‘A Littlehampton man contacted local police on Friday 28 February to report matters relating to investment schemes he had been operating for some local people. ‘Initial inquiries are being made to establish the full circumstances. No arrest has been made at this stage.’ The Financial Conduct Authority said that anyone investing money on behalf of other people should register with them. They said that Reeves had not registered.","Police investigating David Reeves, 68, after he confessed losses to clients .

"By . Wills Robinson . and Peter Allen . The Queen has arrived in the centre of Paris to have a flower market renamed in her honour, marking the end of a three-day state visit to France. Yesterday on the 70th anniversary of the . D-Day landings, she spoke of her pride at the courage of the Allied . forces who invaded Europe on June 6, 1944. Now the people of Paris have given the monarch her very own tribute by renaming the market near Notre Dame Cathedral as Marche aux Fleurs - Reine Elizabeth II. Blossoming diplomacy: The Queen walks around the flower market, renamed Marche aux Fleurs - Reine Elizabeth II, with French President Francois Hollande and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo (left) Royal seal of approval: She unveiled the plaque at the entrance to the market as The Duke of Edinburgh (far left) watched in the background .

Also at the flower market will by Olympic Gold medallist Sir Bradley Wiggins, the first Briton to win the Tour de France. He will be with a team of charity cyclists who are supporting the Forces' organisation Help For Heroes. In unprecedented scenes in an area eternally associated with the French Revolution of 1789, Her Majesty received the honour from the city's Mayor . 'This reflects the enormous affection of Parisians. It gives me great joy to give this lovely flower market your name,' said Ms Hidalgo, as a clearly moved Queen and Prince Philip looked on. They were completing the last day of a hugely successful State Visit, which included attending the D-Day 70th anniversary commemorations in Normandy on Friday. The new square, opposite the city's law courts and close to Notre Dame Cathedral, will now be called 'Marche aux Fleurs- Reine Elizabeth II' - or 'Flower Market - Queen Elizabeth II'. Entrance: The monarch walked down a red carpet, followed by her husband The Duke of Edinburgh, the day after she led tributes on the 70th anniversary of D-Day .

In bloom: She holds a bouquet as she walks around the market with a Union Jack draped behind her . Despite the excited crowds cheering . on the Queen, who was dressed in light pink dress and hat, not everybody . was happy about the new name. Left . wing councillors said it was 'ridiculous' that an unelected monarch was . getting such an accolade in a republic which executed most of its . royals more than 200 years ago. They . are particularly angry because the decision was approved by two . Socialists - Ms Hidalgo and President Francois Hollande, who also . attended this morning's ceremony. Danielle . Simonnet, a councillor representing the Party of the Left (PG) suggested that it would have been far better to honour a 'hero' of the . 1789 French Revolution, such as Maximilien de Robespierre. Ms . Simonnet said: 'Without any sign of a vote, Paris honours the Queen of . England while the city is still not capable of honouring a French figure . of the Revolution such as Robspierre.' Ms . Simonnet was also angry that Ms Hidalgo had paid tribute to abdicating . King Juan Carlos of Spain earlier this week, with the Queen's new market . topping a terrible week for republicanism. She . said: 'Frankly, the mayor of the City of Light, of the capital of the . great French Revolution, can't it send out a message more republican . that this one of deference to the royal vestiges of the old Europe?' Jean-Bernard Bros, of the PRG Radical Party of the Left, tweeted that the decision to honour the Queen was 'questionable'. Banquet: Last night she attended a state dinner at the Elysee presidential palace with French President Francois Hollande alongside Prince Philip . The . flower and bird market has been a Paris landmark since it was first set . up in 1808, on the Ile de la Citi - the island in the Seine where . ancient Paris was founded. It . remains the heart of Paris, and is just across the road from the . Conciergerie, the former prison where Marie Antoinette, the last . pre-Revolutionary Queen of France, was held as Prisoner No. 280 before . she was guillotined in 1793. Despite . the row, flower stall workers said they were delighted by the new name. 'It's a great honour - we are super happy that our market will now be . named after the Queen,' said Ahmel Ganot, 49. Elizabeth . first came to Paris in 1948 as a newlywed Princess, and as Queen had . previously visited in 1957, 1972, 1992 and in 2004. This . time, she arrived by Eurostar on Thursday, before visiting landmarks . including the Arc de Triomphe, where she laid a wreath at the Tomb of . the Unknown Soldier.

Remembrance: After laying a wreath at the British war cemetery in Bayeux, she steps back and bows as she remembers the soldiers who fell on the Longest Day in 1944 . Following the anniversary commemorations in Normandy on Friday, she attended a state banquet hosted by President Hollande. In . a hugely warm and affectionate toast, he described the Queen as someone . who personified the saying 'Keep calm and carry on' - a phrase he . repeated in French and English. The . Queen, in turn, delivered a whole speech alternating between the two . languages, as she recalled her first visit to Paris as a newlywed in . 1948 'just four years after D-Day'. She . said she retained a 'great affection for the French people' and . expressed 'sorrow and regret' about those whose lives were lost fighting . for freedom during the Second World War.

"By . Peter Allen . Hundreds of illegal migrants were today taking advantage of traffic chaos in the Channel Tunnel to try and get into Britain from France. Riot police were called to deal with disturbances in the Calais area as truckers fought to stop stowaways getting on board their vehicles. It follows serious problems with overhead power cables on Monday which led to a Eurotunnel car shuttle grinding to a halt 7.5 miles out of the UK. Scroll down for video . Travel chaos: Police said lorries are backing up for up to two miles leading up to the tunnel . Some 400 passengers had to get out and walk, as numerous trains, including high-speed Eurostar services from London to Paris and Brussels were cancelled or delayed. As the transport problems continued today, migrants camped out in the French port tried to make a break for freedom. 'Lorries are backing up for up to three kilometres leading up to the tunnel, and migrants are swarming over the vehicles,' said a Calais police spokesman. 'Drivers are having to get out to try and clear the migrants, and to protect their loads, so the situation is becoming very fraught. 'Police officers are on the scene trying to deal with the situation. Some trucks are surrounded by up to a dozen migrants, and there are hundreds of them in the area. They get into the back of the lorries or else climb on to the chassis. ' It follows the bulldozing of four illegal camps in Calais - a hard-line measure which left around 600 mainly young men hanging around the town. Hundreds of migrants are camped near the ferry port in Calais, France, in the hope of getting to the UK (file picture) It follows serious problems with overhead power cables on Monday which led to a Eurotunnel car shuttle grinding to a halt 7.5 miles out of the UK . They are all facing arrest, or dispersal around France, meaning many are desperate to get to Britain as soon as possible. There they will claim asylum, or else disappear into the black economy. Following the last bulldozing of a camp near the ferry port last week, police said they were fighting a 'losing battle' to keep the migrants out of Calais. Those taken into police custody had their personal details recorded, and were then offered advice about how to claim asylum in France. 'The vast majority said they wanted to get to Britain, and in these circumstances there was very little else we can do,' said a senior officer involved in the clear-out. 'Most of those apprehended were released and allowed to get on their ways. 'Many destroy their identify papers so we don't even know who they are or where they come from.' A spokesman for Eurotunnel said work on fallen power cables was 'ongoing', meaning continued delays. The French have insisted there will be no repeat of the Sangatte Red Cross refugee centre which acted as magnet for thousands of illegal migrants near Calais before being shut down in 2002. Charity workers helping refugees from wars in Syria and Afghanistan have reacted with outrage to the clear-outs, blaming them on a shift to the far-right in French politics. Most of the migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police and border officials as they try to reach Britain in the back of lorries, but daytime attempts to get on board are now more frequent. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart has long argued that Britain's 'generous welfare system' is the real cause of the migrant crisis in her town.","Riot police were called to deal with disturbances in the Calais area .

"By . Sian Boyle . They are usually thought of as shy and elusive animals, but now herds of deer have been seen wandering the city. The urban herd of fallow deer, thought to have strayed from Epping Forest, have been photographed roaming east London streets at night, nosing into people’s gardens and trotting past cars. British photographer Sam Hobson, 34, spent hours hiding in the darkness waiting for the perfect shot. Fallow deer have been spotted crossing residential streets in east London, swapping the woodland for the urban jungle . Deer are usually thought of as shy and elusive, but this brave group seem at home on the mean streets of London . Mr Hobson, 34, said: 'Wild animals often make terrible models, and it takes a lot of patience and luck to get the compositions you want, but fortunately deer are great subjects for nocturnal photography' He said: ‘It’s not unusual to see deer in city parks, but in this instance, truly wild deer are creeping out of the woods and into residential parts of east London. ‘I think most of the people waiting for the bus to work in the morning are totally unaware that wild deer may have been feeding around their feet just hours before. ‘Wild animals often make terrible models, and it takes a lot of patience and luck to get the compositions you want, but fortunately deer are great subjects for nocturnal photography. ‘Being quite timid, they move slowly and often pause stock-still to listen and look for danger, allowing for the long exposures which create the atmosphere in these pictures.’ Animal charities have had thousands of calls to rescue deer from urban areas, including schools, car parks, and even swimming pools in recent years . An RSPCA spokesman said deer will not cause a nuisance by going through your bins but they might develop a taste for the greenery in your front garden . The RSPCA spokesman said: Fallow deer are like most other deer they . are bold enough to enter urban environments but they're still very . nervous creatures, and will run away if someone approaches them' Animal charities have had thousands of calls to rescue deer from urban environments such as schools, car parks, and even swimming pools in recent years, but say unless they are in danger, the animals are usually best left alone. A spokesperson for the RSPCA said: ‘These creatures aren’t really urban “pests” in the conventional sense, and they won’t do things like go through rubbish bins. ‘Deer will definitely spoil people’s gardens and eat plants and trees though, but in urban areas, they’re more likely to just be passing through. ‘Fallow deer are like most other deer – they are bold enough to enter urban environments but they’re still very nervous creatures, and will run away if someone approaches them.’ All six deer species in Britain are increasing, and while fallow deer only increased by 1.8 per cent [in 2011], muntjac are increasing by 8.2 per cent a year, followed by sika (5.3 per cent), roe deer (2.3 per cent), Chinese water deer  (2 per cent), and red deer  at 0.3 per cent.

"By . Sian Boyle . It was a touching gesture designed to bring about something positive from a friend’s death. When Ozan Yunus, 28, died of meningitis shortly before he was due to fly to Spain for a stag party, his best friend Daniel Pallace asked easyJet for a refund on the ticket so he could donate it to charity. But instead of receiving a compassionate response, he said he was bullied by the airline into handing over a death certificate from the family to prove Mr Yunus was dead. Graduation day: Ozan Yunus (left) died of meningitis shortly before he was due to fly to Spain for a stag party with his best friend Daniel Pallace. Above, the pair are pictured on their graduation day at Leeds University . In the meantime, easyJet put the seat back up for sale. Mr Pallace, a trainee pilot, accused the airline of ‘grave-robbing’ and said: ‘What really shocked me was how easyJet cancelled the reservation but made it available online, so they made money on the seat without refunding us. ‘How can they say we haven’t done enough to get the refund when they’ve already put it back up for sale?’ Mr Yunus, known as Oz, had booked the flight to Barcelona with Mr Pallace to attend another friend’s stag party. 'Bullied': Mr Pallace asked easyJet for a refund on his friend's ticket so he could donate it to a meningitis charity. In response, he claims he was bullied into handing over a death certificate to prove Mr Yunus was dead . The pair – both Londoners who met at Leeds University in 2005 – had paid a total of £108.98 for their two seats. But Mr Yunus, who worked as a primary school teacher in Sidcup, Kent, fell ill with meningitis on Christmas Day. Doctors later told his family he was effectively brain dead. And on December 30, his  parents Sandra, 53, and Ojal, 63, decided to switch off his life- support machine. Mr Pallace contacted easyJet and tried to claim a refund to donate to Meningitis Now – but was told this would require proof of death from his dead friend’s family. Making money: Meanwhile, the airline put Mr Yunus's ticket back up for sale online - for £91.99 (file picture) Hours later, he went online and saw the seat was back on sale for £91.99. The 26-year-old told of his frustration at the bureaucracy he encountered. ‘I contacted his sister Yasemin to forward the death certificate to me so I could give it to them,’ he said. ‘This still wasn’t good enough for them, and even when Yasemin forwarded it herself they wanted more documentation. I can’t believe a death certificate from the sister of the man who has died isn’t enough paperwork for them.’ Miss Yunus, 23, said: ‘They were . completely insensitive and bombarded me with emails. In the end I had to . ask them to show a bit of compassion and stop asking me to prove my . brother was dead.’ Eventually, easyJet did provide a refund. At the teacher’s funeral, the school head gave a speech about his impact on the profession and his hearse drove past his school so the children could say a final goodbye. An easyJet spokesman said: ‘The correct action was taken to protect the personal data in relation to this booking. 'Unfortunately that means the refund could not be issued until security screening had been passed and permission had been given by an immediate family member. ‘We would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced at an already difficult time.’","Ozan Yunus died of meningitis shortly before he was due to fly to Spain .

"By . Sian Boyle . An unjustified suspicion of statins is costing lives, one of Britain’s most senior doctors warned  last night. Professor Sir Rory Collins compared fears over the cholesterol-reducing drugs to the MMR  vaccine scare, in which a researcher falsely claimed the jabs could cause autism. Sir Rory, of Oxford University, singled out the British Medical Journal for running articles criticising statins, adding: ‘It is a serious disservice to British and international medicine.’ Seven million Britons take satins - which lower the cholesterol in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks . Referring to the MMR scandal, he added: ‘I would think the papers on statins are far worse in terms of the harm they have done.’ The professor, one of the UK’s leading experts on statins, said he believes GPs are being made unjustifiably suspicious of the drugs and not prescribing them, causing avoidable deaths. Doctors are often wary of prescribing statins due to side effects such as nausea and insomnia (library image) Seven million Britons take the treatment, which lowers the cholesterol in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks. But many doctors still hesitate to . prescribe them because of reports of harmful side-effects such as . nausea, insomnia, fatigue and kidney and muscle problems. Sir Rory warned the claims of side-effects were particularly damaging because they eroded public confidence. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: ‘We have really good data from over 100,000 people that show that statins are very well tolerated. There are only one or two well-documented side-effects.’ Myopathy, or muscle weakness, occurred in one in 10,000 people, he said, and there was a small increase in diabetes. Only last week, a major study found that statins have virtually no side-effects. Scientists found that patients taking the drugs were less likely to suffer adverse symptoms than a control group taking a placebo. Researchers at Imperial College London looked at 29 trials involving more than 80,000 patients and found the drug only raised the risk of diabetes. Draft NHS guidelines will advise men over 50 and women over 60 to take the drugs as a precaution, which could raise the number using them to 12million.","Sir Rory Collins compared fear over statins to MMR vaccine scare .

"By . Peter Allen . and Stephanie Linning . Smartly dressed in elegant cocktail attire, the smiling couple look ready for an evening out. Now billionaire Monaco heiress Sylvia Pastor, 53, and Cambridge University graduate Wojciech Janowski, 65, - pictured together at a Monaco state event in 2003 - are in custody, suspected of 'masterminding' the assassination of her equally wealthy mother. In custody: Sylvia Pastor, 53, and her husband, Wojciech Janowski, 65, pictured in 2003. Police suspect the pair ordered the Mafia-style hit. Mr Janowski has been Poland's Honorary Consul in Monaco since 2007 . Hélène Pastor, a 77-year-old socialite and businesswoman who was close to the royals who run the Mediterranean principality, was gunned down in a hail of bullets on May 6. She and her chauffer both died of their wounds following the attack outside L'Archet hospital in the French city of Nice, which is a short drive from Monaco. Killed: Hélène Pastor, a 77-year-old socialite and businesswoman, was gunned down on May 6 . Police believe that her daughter, Sylvia Pastor, 53, and her husband, Wojciech Janowski, 65, ordered the Mafia-style hit. Two suspected hitmen were traced after police studied DNA evidence and CCTV footage from the area where Mrs Pastor and her chauffer were killed. The alleged killers, aged 24 and 31, originally from the Comoros islands, and both have criminal convictions. CCTV video shows the two men took a train from Marseille to Nice on day of the shooting, May 6, gone to a hotel, and then made their way to the scene of the crime, said Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin. One of the men is thought to have left his face uncovered. Detectives investigating the murder have traced ‘suspicious financial movements’ into an account belonging to Mr Janowski. Today Mr Robin spoke of ‘apparent links’ between the couple and some 21 others brought into custody at the same time. Arrests have been made in French cities including Nice, Marseille and Rennes. Earlier this week, a spokesman for the Marseille prosecutor, which is leading the investigation into the double murder, said: 'A number of arrests have been made, and a police operation in connection with the killings is ongoing.' The spokesman confirmed French media reports that Sylvia Pastor was among those arrested, along with Wojciech Janowski, who has been Poland's Honorary Consul in Monaco since 2007. 'The arrested man, who was apprehended . by police, is the suspected mastermind, and is in . custody along with his wife,' said the spokesman. Probe: A police officer investigates a car on May 6 at the site in Nice, France, where Hélène Pastor and her driver were killed . Born . in Warsaw in 1949, Janowski graduated from Cambridge in the early . 1970s, before getting involved in a number of major companies in the . water treatment, casino and hotel sectors. He was made an Officer of the Order of . Merit by the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 for his . 'charitable activities'. Arrested: Police believe Wojciech Janowski (pictured), 65, ordered the hit along with his wife . Mrs . Pastor's driver, 64-year-old Mohammed Darwish, succumbed to wounds in . the face, neck and stomach - dying on May 10, shortly before his boss. Investigators suspect two of Italy's most notorious crime syndicates, the 'Ndrangheta and the Camorra, of carrying out the double assassination. Both crime gangs are said to be building property portfolios on the French Riviera as they expand their field of operations. Mrs Pastor's family own buildings worth billions in the area, and detectives believe the Mafia were trying to muscle in. Mrs Pastor had been visiting her son, Gildo, who runs a car hire company, at the Nice hospital when a solo gunman struck. In a classic Mafia-style hit, he shot . both Mrs Pastor and her chauffer in the head and stomach with a . pump-action shotgun through their car window. Following the attack, the hit man jumped into a waiting getaway car driven by another man, and then sped off. Location: Hélène Pastor and her chauffer both died of their wounds following the attack outside L'Archet hospital (file picture) in the French city of Nice, which is a short drive from Monaco . French . MP Eric Ciotti expressed his 'extreme shock' at the double . assassination, while Prince Albert II of Monaco issued a statement . expressing 'deep support' for the Pastor family. Statement: Prince Albert II of Monaco has expressed 'deep support' for the Pastor family . Mrs Pastor was the sister of Michel Pastor, the former chairman of AS Monaco football club who died in February. Her daughter and son, already rich in their own right, would have become billionaires on their mother's death. The Marseille prosecutor has now opened a judicial enquiry into the double murder, parts of which were captured on CCTV. 'We . are studying frozen images of the attack in an attempt to identify the . attackers, and witnesses,' said an investigating source. He said that an alleged blackmailer had been contacting the Pastor family, and was currently undergoing 'psychiatric tests'. Mrs Pastor's grandfather was an Italian immigrant who developed large parts of Monaco before handing his business over to her father, Gildo Pastor. The principality is a tax haven which is regularly linked with organised crime gangs, as well as prominent individuals who want to keep the source of their wealth a closely guarded secret.","Hélène Pastor was gunned down in hail of bullets in May in Nice, France .

Her comments are the first public defence by the head of the CPS of two controversial prosecutions of celebrities - the former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis and Coronation Street star William Roache. Both mens trials ended in them being acquitted for sexual offences – and said they felt they had been targeted unfairly. On being cleared, Mr Lee Travis described his trial as ‘a year and a half of hell’ and said his claimants were ‘money grabbers’, adding ‘I’m an easy target.’ But Mrs Saunders said victims of sex abuse by celebrities face being castigated as money grabbers when they report allegations. She said: ‘It used to be that if a rape victim wore a short skirt, her credibility was undermined. Thankfully, we have moved on. ‘Now we must be careful not to establish new myths that victims come forward only for financial or other motives.’ Both Roache and Travis have complained how the spectre of Savile has haunted their high profile trials, and criticised the CPS for bringing the charges against them. Dave Lee Travis (left) and William Roache (right) have claimed that the 'spectre of Savile has haunted their high profile trials', alleging that there has been a witchhunt among the celebrity community . Prosecutors have been accused of a . ‘witch hunt’ in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, and veteran DJ . Travis was cleared on 12 counts of indecent assault just a week after Mr . Roache walked free from court. Roache’s acquittal came after his fellow Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell was cleared of child sex abuse charges last year following a seven day trail. Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell was cleared of child sex abuse charges last year following a seven day trail . Mrs Saunders took over as DPP in October and claims that women who want to come forward are being put off by feelings of shame, a belief that the system is against them and reluctance to face a ‘deeply invasive’ trial process. In an article for The Times, she said historical cases of sexual offences can result in successful prosecutions - and are just as important as recent offences. She cited the example of teachers successfully prosecuted and given significant jail terms for sexual abuse crimes committed up to 50 years ago. Mrs Saunders also argued that cases of abuse committed historically were just as important as recent offences ‘because for victims the impact remains to this day.’ She added: ‘So long as our criminal justice system is working, we will continue to see acquittals in these types of cases. But we are also seeing convictions.’ The CPS conviction rate for rape has increased to just over 60 per cent, while for all cases taken to court it is more than 80 per cent, and Mrs Saunders highlighted how difficult it is to convict criminals guilty of sexual crimes. After Dave Lee Travis’ acquittal, a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: ‘The CPS is now considering whether a retrial will take place and so it would be inappropriate to comment further while proceedings are still active.’","Alison Saunders says it is a myth that claimants are financially motivated .

"By . Peter Allen . The French prefect responsible for Calais today threatened more forced expulsions of hundreds of asylum seekers trying to get to Britain. It follows last month’s bulldozing of three camps which they were using in between trying to get on board ferries to the UK. Denis Robin, the prefect for the Pas-de-Calais, admitted that the tough measures had not solved the problem, and that more might be necessary. Gendarmes search the shelters of illegal immigrants in their camp at Calais last month. French police expelled around 650 migrants from camps around port, but the region's prefect now says more action may be needed . Speaking at a press conference in . Arras, he said: ‘If this new initiative by the State does not have the . right effect, I will have to proceed with another evacuation.’ Despite riot police doing everything possible to disperse the migrants, Mr Robin said around 900 were still hanging around his region, including many in Calais itself. ‘The Calais migrants are today in a geographic and judicial impasse,’ said Mr Robin. ‘The British government will not let them break the law and circumvent our security measures, and the migrants are not accepting the measures we offer them.’ Despite action which has been attacked by human rights groups, Mr Denis insisted that the ‘French government is ready to hold out a hand, to make a national effort’ to help the migrants. He said any asylum demands would be ‘dealt with urgently’ and that ‘shelters would be offered’, although far away from Channel ports like Calais. Mr Robin insisted there would be no repeat of the Sangatte Red Cross refugee centre which acted as magnet for thousands of asylum seekers before being shut down in 2002. He also pointed to the dangers migrants in Calais were facing after a security guard was arrested on Friday for opening fire on two of them. The victims were hit in the back and arms by a high powered air rifle as they hung around the town’s ferry port along with around 300 other men. Philippe Wannesson, a local volunteer who works with migrants, said the attacks happened ‘not far’ from a food distribution centre set up by charities, but which may now be forced to close. It is currently ‘occupied’ by around 300 migrants, some of whom are on hunger strike to protest at the way they are being treated. Migrants try to resist the forced evictions from their camp. The official reason for the clearance was to prevent an outbreak of the contagious skin disease Scabies from spreading. Squads of riot police smashed up and then bulldozed three illegal camps full of Britain-bound migrants in Calais at the end of May. The official reason for the clearance was to prevent an outbreak of the contagious skin disease Scabies from spreading. But Mr Robin said he also wanted to prevent the creation of another ‘Jungle’ – the name of a similar illegal camp bulldozed in 2009. Critics said the migrants would simply be left on the street, without even a roof over their heads. Border guards meanwhile reported dozens of people hiding in shrubs along roads leading into the port, with many attempting to jump on lorries as they slowed down. A Sudanese asylum seeker was killed around the same time after trying to conceal himself under the axle of a British coach in a supermarket car park. Charity workers helping refugees from wars in Syria and Afghanistan reacted with outrage to the clear-out, blaming it on a shift to the far-right in French politics. Marine Le Pen, president of French far-right party Front National: Charity workers helping refugees from wars in Syria and Afghanistan reacted with outrage to the clear-out, blaming it on a shift right in French politics . Most of the migrants play a nightly game of cat and mouse with the police and border officials as they try to reach Britain in the back of lorries. Once in the UK they will claim asylum, which entitles them to state support while their application is being processed, or disappear into the black economy. Four migrants died in one week alone in March this year. On March 9 an Albanian man was killed on a motorway outside the town. Three days later, Ethiopian Mesfin Germa was hit by a lorry as he walked to the port. The body of a 25-year-old Ethiopian man, Senay Berthay, was found in Calais’s  Batellerie dock on March 14 and the next day a fellow Ethiopian in his 20s was crushed to death by a car while hiding on a vehicle transporter. It is thought he had been among a group of three men who got on the truck and then realised it was going in the wrong direction. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart has long argued that Britain’s ‘generous welfare system’ is the real cause of the migrant crisis in her town.","More action might be needed, says Pas-de-Calais Prefect Denis Robin .

"By . Peter Allen . A man was in custody in Morocco today after burying alive a new girlfriend he met online and causing her death. In a chilling example of the dangers of web dating, 25-year-old French woman Mina El Houari travelled to the North African country to see her new romance. The man, who has not been named, had sent her his picture and the pair had exchanged numerous messages via email and social media. The 25-year-old French woman travelled to the city of Fez in northern Morocco to meet the man she had been in contact with online . But when Miss El Houari, who came from Cadenet, in south-east France, got to his home in the city of Fez she fell seriously ill. Not knowing she was a diabetic, the man said he 'watched her fall unconscious' and 'thinking she was dead' buried her. In fact she was still conscious, according to police reports, but suffocated and died once covered in mounds of earth. Mina had been staying in a five star hotel in Fez, and when she failed to contact staff, or relatives back home, the alarm was raised. A Moroccan police spokesman said they originally found a pair of muddy trousers and a shovel at the suspect's home, but then Mia's body was uncovered. Her parents, who are both hoteliers back in France, have now travelled out to Fez, where the man has 'confessed', said the police spokesman. The suspect remains in custody and 'faces trial', said the spokesman added.","Mina El Houari travelled to Morocco to see her new romance .

"By . Peter Allen . France is facing a multi-million pound bill after ordering 2000 new trains which are 3cm (0.11 inches) too wide for many of its platforms. The incredible mistake means that 1300 stations will have to be upgraded so as to accommodate the trains. Too much too soon: France's new Regiolis TER trains are too wide for many existing station platforms . 'It's an outrageous waste of taxpayers' money,' said Jean-Claude Delarue, of the SOS-Usagers transport pressure group which campaigns for a better deal for commuters. 'The mistake is a hugely embarrassing one and it is not the first time that it has happened. The bureaucrats responsible are completely out of touch.' Rail operations ordered the new trains for the country's regional network – one which traditionally has a reputation for being one of the best in the world. But they are too wide to travel through the nation's stations, a report in the investigative weekly, Le Canard Enchaine, reveals. Repair work has so far been carried out on 300 of the platforms that need adjusting, and hundreds more are on a waiting list. On average, the trains are 3cms too wide. RFF,  the organisation responsible for rail tracks in France, has set aside the equivalent of more than £45m to deal with the mistake, but the figure is likely to be well above £100m once it is finished. The error is said to have happened when RFF handed over the wrong dimensions to SNCF, France's national rail operator. Speeding forwards: France's rail network is traditionally viewed as one of the best in the world . SNCF then put in their order for the new trains to a number of engineering companies including Alstom. The measurements provided by RFF related to platforms built over the past 30 years, but many are far older, and were not built to a standard size. RFF spokesman Christophe Piednoel said: 'We discovered the problem a bit late. We recognise that, and we accept responsibility on that score.' He said that everything possible would be done to avoid passing over the massive cost of the mistake to the taxpayer. France's Minister of Transport, Frederic Culliver, said his country's 'absurd rail system' was to blame, because it makes a division between track operators RFF and SNCF. Many believe the two groups should merge, so as to avoid similar mistakes in the future. Decay in France's ageing regional rail network came into sharp focus last July when a train derailed outside Paris, causing seven deaths. Investigators blamed loose bolts and inadequate safety checks for the disaster, which also saw hundreds of other injured. France is regularly accused of pumping millions into its prestigious high speed TGV system, while ignoring its regional railways.","Red faces in Paris as new fleet of trains causes transport headaches .

"By . Peter Allen . The head of one of Monaco's richest families has died from gunshot wounds following a suspected Mafia hit. Hélène Pastor, a 77-year-old heiress who was close to the royals who run the Mediterranean principality, was hit by a hail of bullets on May 6. She and her chauffeur were attacked outside L'Archet hospital in the French city of Nice, which is a short drive from Monaco. Forensic experts investigate the car in which Helene Pastor was critically injured on May 6 . It is believed Mrs Pastor has been visiting her son in hospital before the shooting happened . Now Mrs Pastor has died in Nice's St Roch hospital, where medics had carried out a number of operations. Her driver, 64-year-old Mohammed Darwish, also succumbed to wounds in the face, neck and stomach – dying on May 10. Investigators suspect two of Italy's most notorious crime syndicates, the 'Ndrangheta and the Camorra, of carrying out the double assassination. Both crime gangs are said to be building property portfolios on the French Riviera as they expand their field of operations. Mrs Pastor's family own buildings worth billions in the area, and detectives believe the Mafia were trying to muscle in. Mrs Pastor had been visiting her son, Gildo, who runs a car hire company, at the Nice hospital when a solo gunman struck. Witnesses said the gunman used a large pump-action shotgun in the suspected 'hit' Reports suggest Mrs Pastor's driver may have been the main target of the shooting . Prince Albert II of Monaco issued a statement expressing 'deep support' for the Pastor family . In a classic Mafia-style hit, he shot both Mrs Pastor and her chauffer in the head and stomach  with a pump-action shotgun through their car window. Following the attack, the hit man jumped into a waiting getaway car drive by another man, and then sped off. A witnesss said: 'I saw the gunman turn back towards me with his big gun and a bag. I thought he was coming for me. I was terrified for my life.' French MP Eric Ciotti expressed his 'extreme shock' at the double assassination, while Prince Albert II of Monaco issued a statement expressing 'deep support' for the Pastor family. Mrs Pastor was the sister of Michel Pastor, the former chairman of AS Monaco football club who died in February. The Marseille prosecutor has now opened a judicial enquiry into the double murder, parts of which were captured on CCTV. 'We are studying frozen images of the attack in an attempt to identify the attackers, and witnesses,' said an investigating source. He said that an alleged blackmailer had been contacting the Pastor family, and was currently undergoing 'psychiatric tests'. The source said: 'He claims to know the background to the attack, but his version may be based on what he has seen in the media.' Mrs Pastor's grandfather was an Italian immigrant who developed large part of Monaco before handing his business over to her father, Gildo Pastor. The principality is a tax haven which is regularly linked with organised crime gangs, as well as prominent individuals who want to keep the source of their wealth a closely guarded secret.","Hélène Pastor shot when gunman opened fire on her car on May 6 .

"By . Peter Allen . Alpine tourist meccas which attract thousands of British tourist every year are among the most polluted in France, new research reveals. It shows that Annecy, the beautiful waterside town surrounded by ski slopes, has the second worst air quality in the whole of France. Despite claiming to have ‘Europe’s cleanest lake’, the World Health Organisation (WHO) survey shows its air is full of dangerous fine particles. The cold dry air found in the ski resorts of the Alps (file pic) traps pollution and stops it blowing away . Annemasse, another French town surrounded by dramatic mountainous countryside on the Swiss border, is similarly blighted. The WHO researchers looked at pollution levels in nearly 1,600 cities in 91 countries for the years 2008-2013. Annecy, which is second on the ‘most polluted air’ list for France, has an average 25 microgrammes of so called PM 2.5s - the most dangerous fine particles. They pose a particularly dangerous risk to anyone with breathing conditions including asthma, but also adversely affect everybody else. The reason for the high level of pollution is the cold, dry, Alpine air which traps pollution close to the ground, and stop it being carried away by the wind. However the region is still far behind Delhi, the most polluted city on Earth, which has six times more harmful particles in the air than European cities . The urban sprawl of Geneva is close to Annecy, and there is always masses of traffic carrying people and goods up to the Alpine towns and villages. The most polluted French city on the list was Douai, in northern France, which had 26 microgrammes of fine, harmful particles per units of air. Delhi, the most polluted city in the world, had 153 micrograms per cubic metre of the most harmful particles - making it some six times more polluted than the worst cities in Europe.","Ski town of Annecy has second highest air pollution in France .

"By . Peter Allen . People who make more than 15 hours of mobile telephone calls a month are three times as likely to develop brain cancer, new research suggests. French scientists claims that sales and business professionals are particularly at risk as they travel from meeting to meeting while communicating with clients and bosses constantly. While most people average around two-and-a-half hours each month talking on their mobiles, busy executives can quickly reach far higher figures. Those who clock up around 900 hours of mobile use during the course of their career are particularly prone to developing a brain tumour. A study carried out at the University of Bordeaux in France has found those who spend more than 15 hours a month on their mobile phones are three times more likely to develop a brain tumour during the course of their life . The researchers drew their conclusions from a study of 253 cases of glioma and 194 cases of meningioma reported in four French departments between 2004 and 2006. Patients were matched against 892 healthy individuals drawn from the general population, in a bid to spot any differences between the two groups. The comparison found a risk among those who used their phone intensively which was three times higher than those who use it far less. The duration of use in the at risk category ranged from between two and 10 years, averaging at five years. The Bordeaux University research, which is published in the British Occupational and Environmental Medicine journal, is the latest possible evidence of the dangers of too much mobile phone use. It led to Priartem, a French pressure group, to call for tougher rules regulating electromagnetic waves. Janine Le Calvez, the group's president, told Le Parisien newspaper: 'How much proof is needed before we launch real protective measures for the population, notably for children who start using mobiles from the age of 13?' The study, which was carried out at the University of Bordeaux (pictured) found those who use their phones for more than 900 hours over the course of their careers were 'particularly prone' to developing a brain tumour . The World Health Organisation's International Agency for Cancer Research has classed electromagnetic waves, including the type emitted by mobile phones, as 'possible carcinogens.' But Roger Salamon, of the ISPED institute which carried out the research, said: 'There is no reason to panic. This does not mean that everyone who makes a call with a mobile phone is going to get a brain tumour.' The study itself reads: 'It is difficult to define a level of risk, if any, especially as mobile phone technology is constantly evolving,"" the study acknowledged. 'The rapid evolution of technology has led to a considerable increase in the use of mobile phones and a parallel decrease of [radiowave intensity] emitted by the phones. 'Studies taking account of these recent developments and allowing the observation of potential long-term effects will be needed.'","Research carried out at University of Bordeaux found cancer link .

"By . Peter Allen . Two Paris policemen were today charged with the rape of a tourist after one admitted having ‘consensual sex’ with her. Both officers were among four arrested last week when a 34-year-old Canadian said she was attacked following a rowdy drinking session. CCTV shows her entering and leaving 36 Quai des Orfevres – the famous headquarters of the city’s judicial police next door to the city’s law courts.

The woman – who is from Toronto but cannot be named for legal reasons – met the men in an Irish pub just across the Seine River from the building late on Tuesday night. She got into conversation with the off-duty men because she said she worked for Canadian police in her home city for three years. ‘The evening was a drunken one, and members of the BRI were said to be involved in the attack,’ said a source close to the case.

Grimaldi in Monaco and an expert on etiquette, used his TV chat show to . reveal the information. Referring to Pippa's famous appearance in Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, when she was praised around the world for her shapely figure, Mr Bern said: 'But of course she had a false bottom.

'I repeat it: she had a false bottom. You take her away from that and she has normal buttocks. 'It was an optical illusion. She knew there were a billion people watching. It was the moment to show it.’ He did not give details about the type of enhancement he believes she used. Pippa was a little-known socialite until her sister, Kate, made her bridesmaid at her wedding to Prince William. Pippa wore a white Alexander McQueen dress and became an instant international star, with many saying that her bottom made her particularly special.

'Because I think if you look at other photos of her and you see her in jeans, she's got quite a flat bottom. 'But I think possibly for the day, for that gorgeous dress, she may have had some sort of pants that gave her a little bit of a lift, or even a little bit of padding.' Pippa, a food columnist for Waitrose Kitchen magazine, travelled to south west France on Monday to visit the Médoc wine vineyards. 'Pippa loves her wine, and it’s fantastic that she’s come to visit the place where the best in France is produced,' said an industry source. Analysed: Pippa at the Queen's Club tennis championships last year. A London spa owner once claimed that she normally has a flat bottom .

"By . Peter Allen . The ex-wife of disgraced International Monetary Fund chief today insisted she 'knew nothing' about his extra-marital affairs and orgies. In her most revealing interview to date, 65-year-old Anne Sinclair also said she 'never believed' he regularly had sexual relations with other women at home and abroad. Mr Strauss-Kahn, once a leading French Socialist who was tipped to become President, saw his career fall apart in 2011 when he was arrested for attempted rape. Anne Sinclair, the ex-wife of disgraced International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn today insisted she 'knew nothing' about his extra-marital affairs and orgies. Couple pictured in 2012 . Although he was later cleared of assaulting a chamber mate in a New York hotel room, numerous other allegations about the 64-year-old's sex life were also made public. Now, in the tell-all interview to be broadcast in France tonight, Ms Sinclair said his court ordeal was a 'nightmare', adding: 'I know it sounds idiotic, but believe it or not, I didn't know' about his sordid sex life. Happier times: Strauss-Kahn and Sinclaire pictured together in Toulouse in 2006 . But Ms Sinclair, a multi-millionaire heiress and journalist, did concede: 'When I married Dominique, I knew he was a charmer, that he was a seducer. That I knew'. Now Mr Strauss-Kahn faces trial on charges of aggravated pimping charges and could end up in prison. He is said to have organised sex parties with prostitutes in France and America which judges have described as 'carnage on mattresses'. In the . France 2 interview, Ms Sinclair explains: 'I had doubts, yes, doubts . that every couple has. I would often, sometimes, go to him, ask him if . things were true or not.' Pressed . by interviewer Laurent Delahousse Ms Sinclair said: 'Listen, you can . believe me or not, but I didn't know....Rumours are made to destroy, to . kill, to damage - so I ignored them.' Ms . Sinclair said she never believed the claims of Nafissatou Diallo, the . New York hotel maid whose allegations led to Strauss-Kahn's arrest and . his resignation from the IMF. 'I didn't believe it, I don't believe it and I know it's not true,' said Ms Sinclair. In . 2012, a civil lawsuit brought by Ms Diallo against Mr Strauss-Kahn was . settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, said to be up to six . million dollars. Tristan Banon, a French writer, also accused Strauss-Kahn of attacking her 'like a rutting chimpanzee' in a Paris flat in 2003. Preliminary charges of attempted rape were dropped in 2011 due to a three-year statute of limitations. Asked how she got through the scandals involving her ex-husband, Ms Sinclair said: 'You know, when you have hurdles to jump, you just think about the next hurdle and ask - how am I going to make the next step? 'Looking at pictures from the courtroom, you ask yourself: 'How can I climb the next step'. You don't think about the three following ones.' Mr Strauss-Kahn and 13 other defendants are due to be tried for their alleged roles in a prostitution ring operating out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille, northern France. Mr Strauss-Kahn now works as an economic consultant to a number of organisations including the governments of Serbia and South Sudan.","Anne Sinclair, 65, she said 'never believed' he had sex with other women .

"By . Ollie Gillman For Mailonline . A Romanian man who found what could be the oldest forged coins in history while out treasure hunting with his son says he will use his  fortune to 'buy a new metal detector'. Paul Croituru, 37, dug up the trove of 300 forged silver coins worth nearly £120,000 - more than ten times what he earns a year as a council worker. But the father, who found the ancient Greek coins with the help of son Alexandru, 13, immediately told the authorities and will now lose nearly all of the money because of local treasure hunting rules. Despite being forgeries of the 2,350-year-old Tetradrachm currency, experts say each 5mm penny is worth £400. The haul of 309 whole coins and 40 fragments is worth around £120,000, according to currency experts . Paul Croituru, 37, found the ancient Greek forged coins near the site of a medieval village in northern Romania . The father and son found 309 whole coins believed to be worth £400 each, as well as 40 fragments of the forged currency, but went straight to the authorities with their haul. They are believed to be the oldest counterfeit coins ever found, and were produced just 400 years after the first ever coins were made. The pair are now likely to receive £12,000 - just 10 per cent of the estimated total value of the forged coins - while the rest goes to the Government. Mr Croituru said: 'It is still more than I earn in a year from my job but I have never done this for money. 'There are those in the area that say I was foolish not to have kept the lot, and could easily have sold them abroad with nobody any the wiser. 'But my son would have known, and what sort of an example is that for a boy to get from his father? I don't have any regrets. 'I thought to be an example for my son. He is passionate about history. Mr Croituru said they were using an old metal detector that was worth around £120 when he bought it, but is now considering an upgrade. 'If I get something, I'll buy a new metal detector,' he added. Each 2,350-year-old silver coin is thought to be worth £400, even though it was made as a forgery . The Croiturus found the silver coins in a 25 metres squared area of the Partestii de Sus region of northern Romania, near the site of a long-abandoned medieval village. The coins, which weigh 1.5kg altogether, were buried at depths between two inches and two feet. Experts believe they are forgeries of the ancient Greek Tetradrachm currency and could be around 2,350 years old, dating back to when King Philip II reigned over the then Ancient Greek Kingdom of Macedon. Most of the coins show a Greek solider on horseback on one side and a face on the other. Local historian Viorel Blanaru said: 'They are made of raw silver, quite good workmanship, quite good copies but that's what they are - copies of Greek coins.' However, in ancient times it was the quality of the silver that was important, and he said that exchanging parts of coins was an way of giving change. He said: 'If you had something that cost half a penny, and you only had a penny, you simply cut it in half which would explain why there were also fragments.' The coins will be restored and taken to Suceava History Museum in north-eastern Romania, where they will be put on display. Mr Croituru said: 'We have never found anything much before. The odd coin - but mostly just bullet cases, old tins or rusty nails. 'It can be a bit disheartening but it was fun to spend time together and of course dream we would one day find something.' But in the latest expedition, that was exactly what happened when the father and son team heard a huge bleep and began digging out an astonishing haul of coins. 'We found one, then another, then another, then a pile of them. We couldn't believe it. We were pulling them up in handfuls,' he said. 'It is every treasure hunter's dream.' 1) Wesley Carrington found Roman coins worth £100,000 in a field near St Albans, Hertfordshire in June last year, just 20 minutes after buying his first metal detector. After finding 55 1,700-year-old coins he joked that his treasure hunting career had 'peaked early'. 2) Experienced metal detectors Reg Mead and Richard Miles found 50,000 silver Roman coins in a secret location in Jersey in 2012. They were valued at a whopping £10million in total. 3) David and Andrew Whelan were metal detecting in a field near Harrogate, North Yorkshire in 2007 when they stumbled upon an engraved silver bowl. They called in help and discovered more silver items and coins, with the total haul worth £1million. 4) In 1966 a group of builders in Ravenshead, Nottinghamshire uncovered more than a thousand gold coins, as well as a haul of jewellery, believed buried by someone fleeing from battle during the War of the Roses in the 15th century. The British Museum bought the treasure for £300,000. 5) After seven years of combing beaches and fields without success, housewife Mary Hannaby found a 300-year-old gold pendant on a farm in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. It was believed to be worth around £250,000.","Paul Croituru and 13-year-old son Alexandru dig up 300 ancient Greek coins .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary For Mailonline . A woman and her two young daughters found dead in her car in a middle school parking lot died from accidental heatstroke, the Maryland medical examiner's office said Tuesday. The formal cause of death was hyperthermia and environmental heat exposure, spokesman Bruce Goldfarb said. Allison Keyonda Pluck, also known as Allison Lancaster, 32, was found dead in her silver Nissan sedan June 16 along with the bodies of her daughters Shania Gill, 18 months, and Shameka Gill, 6 months. Pluck was reclined in the driver's seat and the girls were strapped in their child seats with the windows closed, the ignition off and the doors unlocked, police said. Scene: Allison Keyonda Pluck and her two young daughters were found dead inside a parked car in a middle school parking lot in June . Hagerstown police spokesman Paul Kifer told MailOnline police received a verbal confirmation yesterday, but were waiting to notify Pluck's family and receive an official notice from the medical examiner's office. Kifer said Pluck had been working at a Wal-Mart in Frederick, but had stopped working there about two months before she was found dead. Police have found no connection between the family and the school. Police said in June that an employee of Western Heights Middle School, leaving on the last day for teachers before summer break, spotted the bodies in the late afternoon. The outdoor temperature peaked near 90 degrees that day. 'There was no medication, weapons or other substances found in the car that could have been identified as being used to cause a death,' police said in a June release. Surveillance video at a local Wal-Mart showed Pluck buying a DVD player at about 6 a.m. that day. Mystery: Authorities have found no connection between the family and the middle school . School surveillance video showed the car arriving at the school at 6:16 a.m., then driving around the back of the building and parking in an employee lot, where it remained until the bodies were found around 4:30 p.m. The children's father lives in Hagerstown but didn't live with the mother and was never married to her, police have said. Police say Pluck had recently moved from West Virginia to Hagerstown, about 70 miles west of Baltimore. Both Pluck and the father of her children moved from Guyana to the United States, police said.","Allison Keyonda Pluck, 32, was found dead in a middle school parking lot in her silver Nissan sedan June 16 .

Venomous: Ms Whenlan has been overrun with the false widow spiders - a few of which are pictured - and has killed up to 23 of them in a single day . 'Last night we had a couple of the . spiders on the patio door - if the door would have been left open they . would have been in the house.' The single mother first saw the spiders shortly before she was admitted to hospital for an operation. After . returning home ten days later she discovered the number of arachnids in . her garden had increased dramatically, some the size of a 50p coin. Nicole has already been bitten on the forearm and has puncture wounds in her skin. Menace: Dozens of the tiny by dangerous spiders have spun webs all over Nicole Whelan's garden in Swindon . She said: 'My daughter is not allowed to play outside, where she has a wendy house full of toys, because I'm worried that the spiders may be hidden in there. Primed for action: Nicole Whelan is swatting any of the false widow spiders she sees . 'I've already been bitten by one of the spiders and I worry if the same was to happen to her it could potentially be deadly - as young people are affected more severely by the bites. 'I know some people are saying they are completely harmless but actually experts say that being bitten by the spider is similar to being stung by a bee - and no responsible parent would let their children play by a bee's nest.' Nicole has been following the advice issued by experts and killing the spiders wherever possible. She blasts them with bathroom cleaner but says the big ones then take up to 30 minutes to die. 'I killed 23 spiders just last night by spraying them with bathroom cleaner - it's all I've got that will rid of them. 'The problem is they jump at you, I'm not being a big scaredy cat . 'The biggest one I've seen so far has been about the size of a 50p coin, excluding the legs.' The spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns. Millions of false widows, pictured right, Britain's most poisonous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing. Also known as steatoda nobilis, it is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom. The false widow was first spotted in the UK in Torquay, Devon, in 1879. It is understood that it may have made its way to these shores from Madeira or the Canary Islands in a shipment of bananas. The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about 15mm in size. The Natural History Museum says that warmer summers mean the spider is spreading northwards through the UK, having been found mainly in southern England. This theory is backed by its wildlife surveys where people report sightings to them.HOW TO AVOID BITES AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET ONE . The key message is that you shouldn't disturb spiders if you can help it because they will usually only bite you if they feel threatened. To avoid it while asleep, remove everything from under the bed so that the only way the spiders can get up on the bed is to crawl up one of the four legs. Do not leave clothes around in piles for long periods as spiders like to hide in them and shake shoes in case a spider has crawled in overnight. If you have a garage store things in plastic bags if you use them with your hands and feet and cannot see inside. Also seal cardboard boxes if you are storing things. If you are unfortunate enough to be bitten and have a reaction, pack the wound in ice and seek medical attention.","Nicole Whelan's garden was overrun with Britain's most dangerous spider .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Plain packaging for cigarettes could be the 'game changer' in seeing long-term reductions in smoking among young people, health officials have said. Public Health England (PHE) said that the evidence for the benefits of introducing standardised packing for cigarettes and other tobacco products is now 'irrefutable'. In Australia, where the measure was introduced in December 2012 , there has been the fastest decline in smoking rates for over 20 years, according to PHE - an arm's length body of the Department of Health. Public Health England (PHE) said that the evidence for the benefits of introducing standardised packing for cigarettes and other tobacco products into the UK is now 'irrefutable' (file picture) Standardised packaging increases the effect of health warnings on cigarette boxes and helps to de-normalise smoking, it said. Responding to a consultation on the proposed measure, PHE said: 'As a powerful addition to the existing levers at our disposal, we believe standardised packaging could be the game changer. 'The evidence is clear that standardised packaging increases the effectiveness of health warnings and reduces the appeal of cigarette packaging to young people and adults. It removes a powerful marketing tool and the ability to influence perceptions about the relative risk between cigarette brands. 'Standardised packaging influences behaviour, encouraging smokers to reduce their smoking and to quit. 'As part of a comprehensive programme of tobacco control, standardised packaging makes a powerful contribution to the de-normalisation of smoking as a socially acceptable behaviour. The potential benefits to public health should not be underestimated. 'Smoking is one of the nation's most serious public health challenges, with the greatest harm suffered by the least advantaged in society. The evidence for the benefits standardised packaging can deliver is now irrefutable. To delay its introduction is to delay our receipt of those benefits.' Professor Kevin Fenton, national director of health and wellbeing at PHE, added: 'Smoking remains the biggest cause of premature mortality in England, accounting for 80,000 deaths every year. 'Standardised packaging is a powerful measure that would help to save lives. The evidence from Australia is adding to the substantial and irrefutable case that the absence of attractive packaging works to reduce the number of smokers, as well as encouraging others to cut down.' The consultation, which closes tomorrow, was put out to help UK governments to decide whether or not introduce the measure. It was launched by the Department of Health after a recent review concluded the initiative could contribute to a 'modest but important reduction' in smoking rates. In Australia, where the measure was introduced in December 2012, there has been the fastest decline in smoking rates for over 20 years (file picture) The Sir Cyril Chantler review suggested that the measure, which would see cigarettes and other tobacco products put in drab and purposefully unattractive packaging, would contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of smoking. Health experts have long campaigned for the measure to be introduced, saying that brightly coloured packages are the last marketing ploy that tobacco companies use to lure people to their products. But smoking groups claimed that stripping cigarette packets of branding would lead to an increase in illicit trade of tobacco products and job losses. In December 2012, Australia became the first country in the world to put all tobacco products in standardised packs. The law banned the use of logos, brand imagery, symbols, other images, colours and promotional text. Cigarettes and other tobacco products are now sold in packets which portray a range of gruesome images including dying cancer sufferers, diseased feet and ill babies. It is widely expected that if a similar measure was introduced here then packs would look similar to those used in Australia. Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: 'The need for legislation on standardised packaging for all tobacco products is indisputable and this latest research (from PHE) shows the wider benefits that society will reap. We now look forward to the Government introducing standardised packaging at the soonest possible time.' Pro-smoking group Forest reiterated its opposition of the measure. A spokesman for the group said its petition against the measure has gained more than 100,000 signatures and more than 50,000 people have personally written to the Prime Minister opposing the initiative. Group director Simon Clark said: 'The response demonstrates the strong level of opposition to this ill-conceived measure. We urge the Prime Minister to think again. 'There's no evidence standardised packaging will have any health benefits. Advocates base their arguments not on facts but on speculation. 'There must be no rush to legislation. It's a huge step and no government should take it lightly.'","Public Health England says evidence for benefit of plain packs is 'irrefutable'

One in nine Brits (11 per cent) believe a CT scan is a ‘computerised torso scan’, while eight per cent are convinced a haemorrhage is just another word for piles. The study was carried out by AXA PPP healthcare and highlights the confusion many experience when they see their GP. In a survey of 2,000 adults, 11 per cent admitted being too embarrassed to ask questions, while ten per cent were reluctant to do so in case they wasted their GP’s time. Health experts have warned that the embarrassment factor is causing a tidal wave of confusion. Worryingly, a fifth of us (21 per cent) feel baffled because our doctor doesn’t take enough time to explain things - leaving us feeling rushed during appointments. Another three per cent of Brits have simply given up and gone to see another doctor. Dr Gary Bolger, Chief Medical Officer at AXA PPP healthcare said: 'Good communication is a two-way process. Fear: In a survey of 2,000 adults, 11 per cent admitted being too embarrassed to ask questions, while ten per cent were reluctant to do so in case they wasted their GP's time . 1. CT scan - computerised tomography scan (57 per cent do not know this) 2. Ganglion - a harmless cyst (55 per cent) 3. Somnambulism - sleepwalking (49 per cent) 4. Hypertension - high blood pressure (41 per cent) 5. MRI scan - magnetic resonance imaging (35 per cent) 6. Fracture - broken bone (23 per cent) 7. Benign - not harmful in effect (21 per cent) 8. Haemorrhage - an escape of blood from a ruptured blood vessel (19 per cent) 'It is important for GPs to remember that a sizeable minority of their patients may not have sufficient knowledge or understanding to take in what they’re saying. 'While some patients can find it intimidating to question their GP when they don’t understand what they’ve said, patients should remember their doctor is there to help them. 'They shouldn’t be afraid or embarrassed to ask their doctor to explain what they mean.' When it comes to knowledge of medical terms, the study discovered younger generations are less well informed. Only 63 per cent of 18 to 24 year olds correctly identified a fracture as a broken bone - compared with 91 per cent of those aged over 55. Worryingly, five per cent actually thought it referred to a torn muscle. Another 52 per cent of young adults correctly identified hypertension as high blood pressure - compared to the 69 per cent of older respondents. Nearly a fifth (17 per cent) thought MRI stood for multiple radiation investigation, while nine per cent opted for mass radiation inventory. Hypertension was mistakenly defined by six per cent of Brits as a hyperactive disorder, while 12 per cent believed a diagnosis of sleepwalking was a type of ear infection.","One in ten 18 to 24 year olds think a 'benign' condition is terminal .

"By . Paul Donnelley . In 2006, 12-year-old In 2006 Hugo Cornellier saw a video comprising hundreds of self-portraits and was so inspired he began taking selfies and has become obsessed about taking one every day.saw a video of self-portraits that photographer Noah Kalina had uploaded to YouTube – and decided to copy the idea. From that day, Mr Cornellier has taken a selfie and now the resulting almost 3,000 photographs form the basis of a new video he has posted, . Three years ago, five years into his project he posted the video on social news site Reddit’s r/IAmA section. Scroll down for video . From first to last:  Hugo Cornellier began taking selfies when he was 12 (left) and is still taking them daily. He has compiled all the nearly 3,000 shots into a video and the last image taken when he was 19 is above right . The one-minute video was so popular it appeared on the section’s front page until it was taken down without explanation by moderators. At the time, Mr Cornellier said that although he had missed a day or two, he was obsessed by selfies: ‘I would take my laptop everywhere my family went. Whether it was a holiday or to visit family for a few days, I always had to take my photo every single day, no matter what. Hair tpday, gone tomorrow: Hugo Cornellier has missed only a couple of days of taking selfies . The eyes have it: In none of the selfies does Mr Cornellier crack a smile . That was three years ago and Mr Cornellier shows no sign of flagging as the new video lasting 1 minute 34 seconds shows. 'It all started because my dad bought a time-lapse camera. I'd seen similar videos but I realized no one had done it to document their teenage years. And I thought, ""I want to create one,""' he told the MailOnline. 'I knew I was going to change a lot physically in the next few years.' Cornellier was right - in the video, he goes from a smooth-cheeked pre-teen to a young man, complete with beard and requisite hair experimentation. It's riveting to watch, and for Cornellier, the video hasn't lost any of its fascination. 'Even single time I look at it it remind it's amazing. It still has an effect on me,' he said. Even more amazing is that Cornellier didn't lose interest in the project in a bout of teen apathy. 'I took the first 50 pictures and made a time-lapse video with them, and it was so cool. I didn't want to stop after that,' he told MailOnline. It became a habit for Cornellier, and he made sure to keep it up even while traveling in Cuba or holidaying in New Brunswick, using whatever method possible, including his mom's iPad. Over seven years - roughly 2,500 days - he estimates he's only missed about 50 days. 'Every time I would miss a day, I would feel bad. I would go on holiday and I'd take a camera. No matter where I went, I really just had to do my photo.' Hairy look: Having experimented with an elaborate goatee, Mr Cornellier goes the whole hog with a full beard . Mr Cornellier takes his selfies on his laptop and at times multi-tasks listening to his sounds (right) Occasionally Mr Cornellier ventured outside to take his selfies (left) and once in a while went for a new hairstyle and matched it with a beard but eschewed a moustache . When he first began to post his videos, he called the project 'Picture Everyday.' But with the rise of the selfie, Cornellier thought he'd capture the zeitgeist and changed it to 'Selfie Everyday,' which he says has made his traffic rise exponentially. 'Changing it helped,' he said of the name. 'The trend has definitely helped my video.' But even Cornellier is amazed by the response to his latest cut. 'I never expected it, it's gone crazy. Every two minutes there's a comment,' he said. The video has received hundreds of comments from its viewers. So far it has been seen by almost one and a half million people and the reaction has, it is fair to say, been mixed. While a viewer compliments Hugo Cornellier's looks, another compares watching the video to taking drugs . Another viewer thought that while Richard Linklater's 2014 film Boyhood - shot over a 12-year period - was not very good, she liked Hugo Cornellier's effort while Colin McGarry does not care for the video but cares enough to post a comment about it . And while seven years is a long time to commit to a project, Cornellier has no plans to stop. 'I'm absolutely going to keep going. I'm never going to stop. I'm going to keep doing it forever,' he told MailOnline. 'I'm going to do it until I get old. The video will be me from 12 until literally wrinkles on my face. Thinking about that is what makes me keep going. 'My entire life in three minutes. That's what inspires me to keep doing it.'","Hugo Cornellier saw a video of self-portraits in 2006 and became obsessed with copying it .

"By . Zoe Szathmary For Mailonline . Women from an Ohio strip club took their tops off Sunday morning to protest a Christian church that has allegedly been trying to undermine their business. The Foxhole North women were part of a group of protesters filmed by WBNS carrying signs in front of New Beginnings Church. Members from the Warsaw church 'do everything they can to keep the customers from going in,' Thomas George, owner of The Foxhole North, told MailOnline. 'They ask, ""Does your wife know where you're at? Does your mother know where you're at? Does your sister know where you're at?' Scroll down for video . Protest: Women from strip club The Foxhole North appeared topless on Sunday, protesting New Beginnings Church. The church has allegedly been harassing the employees as well as its customers . Fight back: The protesters were seen carrying signs in front of the church during Sunday services . '[They tell customers] ""We're taking pictures of your license plate, we're taking video and posting it to the web,""' he said. Those photos and videos once appeared on the now-defunct stopthefox.com, George said. He said he believes they currently appear on a different Christian website. George also alleged the churchgoers call his female employees 'w*****.' Despite the women being half-naked, The Coshocton Tribune reported they 'were not a major spectacle, as only a few people turned out to watch for a few minutes.' However, a protester in support of The Foxhole North was filmed engaging in a heated exchange with a parishioner. 'Love is the answer and you don't have it baby. God is love,' a protester said. A New Beginnings member replied, 'Ma'am, . you know nothing about love. You know plenty about lust. You know plenty . about sex, but you know nothing about love.' Owner: The Foxhole North owner Thomas George alleged members of New Beginnings church have photographed his customers' license plates and taped them going into the club . Pastor: Paul Dunfee, pictured, has said the club 'has no business in this community' New Beginnings Pastor Paul Dunfee 'puts a very different face on than when he is [in front of people he thinks are important,' George said, calling New Beginnings 'a cult.' 'I'm sorry that this has come to this and I'm sorry that we've had to come to this extreme measure,' he said. Meanwhile, Dunfee told WBNS 'I hope [George] will realize that the Foxhole has no business in this community.' George alleged that two Tier 1 sex offenders were members of New Beginnings church when his strip club protested the church in 2010. He also claimed to have once been threatened by one churchgoer, who told him 'I could take you out from a half-mile away with my rifle.' George said he has tried to file 'numerous charges' against New Beginnings, but that 'the city law director refused to do anything [...] and has been on their side and advising them.' New Beginnings could not be immediately reached for comment by MailOnline. Taped? George alleges that the photos and videos taken by members of New Beginnings Church appeared on a website called stopthefox.com .","Topless women from strip club The Foxhole North were part of a group of protesters carrying signs in front of New Beginnings Church on Sunday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Father-of-three Gordon Hendricks, 43, (above) has been crowned the most convincing Elvis tribute act . The world’s best Elvis impersonator has been unveiled – as a barber from Stoke-on-Trent called Gordon. Gordon Hendricks, a 43-year-old father of three, was stunned when judges at the Collingwood Elvis Festival in Canada named him the most convincing tribute act to the King. Watched by Priscilla Presley, Gordon was handed the prestigious title last Saturday after blowing them away with his rendition of Elvis' top hits. ‘When they told me I had won I was just amazed,’ he said yesterday on his return home. ‘I still can’t believe it fully now. ‘I got through to the top three and that was amazing, but then when I performed American Trilogy it just felt right.’ He has sung Elvis songs since he was a small child and began performing in local clubs for £50 a night in 2003 ‘because I enjoyed it’. But since winning TV’s Stars In Their Eyes contest in 2005, he has progressed to touring the UK with a 22-piece backing band. He has also appeared on the Graham Norton Show. ‘Since then it has been a whirlwind,’ he said. ‘I would never have guessed I would be doing this when I first started out.’ However, despite his newfound fame, he still cuts hair three days a week at his barber shop in Stoke called Hendricks - which is run by his two sons. He said he credits his success to 'never forgetting about Elvis'. He said: 'I think a lot of people forget that it is about him, not them. 'At these competitions it becomes about the impersonator, they have fan groups just there to support them. 'I try and never forget about Elvis. He is the reason we are there, it is his talent that means we can do what we do. 'I started off with Elvis when I was about three or four, I couldn't help it really, I grew up in a family who loved him. 'You are a sponge at that age and I just absorbed it all. 'When I grew up I moved on and got a real job, but it was always my party trick to do impressions, and I would always do Elvis songs at karaoke. 'In 2003 I started doing the odd club and pub for about £50 a time because I enjoyed it. 'Then in 2005 I was on Stars In Their Eyes doing Elvis, and I won the competition. The Elvis impersonator was crowned the best tribute act to the King at Collingwood Elvis Festival in Canada .

'I got through to the top three and that was amazing, but then when I performed American Trilogy it just felt right. 'When they told me I had won I was just amazed. I still can't believe it fully now. 'They told me I was bound for big things with my act and I just couldn't believe it.' He admits wife Amanda, 32, had barely heard of Elvis when the pair met and sneaky Gordon didn't reveal his talent until she saw him on TV. Watched by Priscilla Presley, Gordon was handed the prestigious title  after blowing the judges away with his rendition of Elvis' top hits . Mr Hendricks has sung Elvis songs since he was a small child and began performing in local clubs  in 2003 . He added: 'She is a big fan now. 'She is a bit younger than me, so listened to completely different stuff. 'I didn't tell her what I did at first, we just met at a bar and got chatting, I told her I was a hairdresser and that was it. 'She didn't find out until she saw me on Graham Norton's show. She asked me if that was me and I told her all about it. 'She was amazed and had had no idea and no real idea about Elvis before.'","Gordon Hendricks has been crowned most convincing tribute act to Elvis .
