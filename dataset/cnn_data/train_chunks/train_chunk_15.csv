"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- If you're out of work like Steve Lippe, who was laid off from his job as a salesman in January, you know you already have problems. But looking at the fine print that came with his new unemployment debit card, he became livid. A brochure that goes out to Pennsylvanians seeking unemployment via debit card lists a number of fees. ""A $1.50 [fee] here, a $1.50 there,"" he said. ""Forty cents for a balance inquiry. Fifty cents to have your card denied. Thirty-five cents to have your account accessed by telephone."" He was quoting fees listed in a brochure that goes out to every unemployed person in Pennsylvania who chooses to receive benefits via debit card. He was given the option when he filed for jobless payments: Wait 10 days for a check or get the card immediately. Like most of the 925,000 state residents who received unemployment benefits in February in Pennsylvania, he chose the debit card and only then, he says, did he learn about the fees. ""I was outraged by it,"" he told CNN. ""I was very noisy about it. I just couldn't believe it. An outrage is just too weak a word. It's obscene."" According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 30 states offer direct deposit cards to the unemployed. Many of the nation's biggest banks have contracts with the individual states. JP Morgan Chase, for instance, has contracts with seven states and has pending deals with two others, according to Chase spokesman John T. Murray. About 10 states, the Labor Department says, pay by check only. The National Consumer Law Center says fees range from 40 cents to a high of $3 per transaction, if the debit card is used at an out-of-network ATM. Most banks give jobless debit card users one free withdrawal per deposit period, which averages every other week in most states. But consumer advocates, including the Law Center, say the unemployed ""should be able to obtain cash and perform basic functions with no fees."" A key Democratic member of the House Financial Services Committee, which oversees bank regulation and theTroubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), told CNN she agrees wholeheartedly. ""Fees should not be attached to unemployment benefits that the taxpayers are paying to help Americans,"" Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, told CNN. ""Particularly, these fees should not be attached by banks that are getting TARP money and are being supported by taxpayer dollars."" CNN asked some of the major banks involved in the debit card program for a response. Spokesmen for JP Morgan Chase, Wachovia, Bank of America and Wells Fargo all directed us to the individual state governments for comment. The acting secretary of labor and industry for Pennsylvania is Sandi Vito. Via e-mail, her staff invited CNN reporters to Allentown, Pennsylvania, where she was taking part at a public meeting at an elementary school. Afterward, she said, she would answer questions about the debit card fees. But when the meeting ended, her staff said she was too busy to talk.  Watch Vito leave meeting in a hurry » . Her spokesman, Troy A. Thompson, spoke with CNN after Vito left. ""The distribution system for people getting their benefits has been improved by the use of debit cards, way above and beyond the distribution by check,"" he said. The U.S. Department of Labor provided what it called ""talking points"" to CNN when asked for comment on the fee structure. ""States can do a better job negotiating fees with banks,"" the department said. ""Many states have obtained terms far more favorable to claimants than those described in media reports."" In addition, according to the talking points, the Labor Department said it was aware states are offering unemployment debit cards for good reasons: . •  It is less expensive for claimants without bank accounts because they don't need to pay check cashing fees. • Claimants can use the card free at merchants and therefore don't need to carry excess cash. • Generally, these cards are safer and more secure than checks. ""We will be working with states as they gain experience with debit cards to resolve these problems related to fees,"" the Labor Department said.","Pennsylvania one of several states offering debit cards in lieu of checks for jobless .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lankan soldiers seized a key rebel stronghold over the weekend, as humanitarian agencies feared for the safety of civilians. Sri Lankan troops at Elephant Pass, the isthmus that connects north Jaffna peninsula to rest of the country. ""It's an incredibly serious situation,"" James Elder, a U.N. spokesman, said Monday. ""We have a very large number of people, including tens of thousands of children, trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone."" Government forces took the area in a surprise attack early Sunday, the head of Sri Lanka's army announced. Troops crossed a lagoon and entered the town of Mullaittivu before encountering heavy resistance from Tamil fighters, according to the government-run news agency. ""Our troops fought their way through a 40 km (25 mile) thick jungle track,"" Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka said in a televised address Sunday. ""This is the long-awaited victory and I am happy to say that our heroic forces today captured the Mullaittivu town after 12 years,"" he said. There has been no confirmation from the rebels that the strategic garrison has been overtaken. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) -- commonly known as the Tamil Tigers -- have fought for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead. The rebels gained control over Mullaittivu in 1996 and established a military garrison there, according to the government. In recent days, the military has made significant progress in its campaign to recapture rebel strongholds. Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. It had been in rebel hands for more than nine years. The recapture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies. Previously, it was done by air and sea. ""The area that the LTTE has dominated has shrank phenomenally,"" Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India, C.R Jayasinghe, told CNN. ""They lost ... about 90 percent of what they had."" Despite major government gains, critics point to ongoing civilian casualties resultant from the conflict. ""This is a critical moment in the conflict when the space for these people has shrunk,"" Elder said. The United Nations is ""calling on the ... Tamil Tigers to meet their international responsibilities and guarantee that these very large civilian populations to move freely and then can move away from the conflict and to areas where they can receive appropriate assistance,"" Elder said. ""Some Sri Lankan U.N. staff are trapped there,"" he said in a Sunday interview. ""Convoys are going to the area, delivering emergency supplies, but these are not sufficient for the number of people in need."" Sri Lankan authorities are barring journalists and humanitarian aid workers from areas where heavy fighting is taking place. Amnesty International spokesman Shuransu Mishra estimated that ""over a quarter of a million of the population, mostly Tamils, are trapped between the two sides."" The organization says greater access and protection for aid workers and journalists are needed as news agencies struggle to report an accurate picture of the conflict. ""The Sri Lankan authorities are doing little to ensure the safety of the country's media, or to prosecute those responsible for murdering or attacking them,"" Amnesty International spokeswoman Yolanda Foster said in a written statement on Friday. The Sri Lankan authorities ""are also directly responsible for subjecting journalists to harassment and interrogation,"" she said. At least 14 journalists have been killed since the start of 2006, according to the statement. Others have been driven from the country by death threats, or in fear of detention and torture by government authorities, it said.","Government forces took the area in a surprise attack early Sunday .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House has invoked executive privilege to keep President Bush's top political adviser, Karl Rove, from having to testify Thursday about the firings of at least eight U.S. attorneys. The White House invoked executive privilege to keep . Karl Rove from having to testify Thursday. Rove, ""as an immediate adviser to the president,"" can't be ordered to testify and has been told not to appear, White House Counsel Fred Fielding told the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee called Rove and his deputy, Scott Jennings, to testify Thursday morning. The White House says it is trying to protect the president's ability to receive candid advice and offered to let top aides discuss the firings only if they were not placed under oath and no transcript was taken. ""It is regretted that the committee has forced this action, as the president's offer of accommodation to you and to the House Judiciary Committee could have provided information being sought in a manner respectful of presidential prerogatives and consistent with a spirit of comity,"" Fielding wrote. But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, accused the White House of trying to cover up Rove's role in the firings. He questioned why Rove discussed the matter publicly when the issue first made news, but now ""is suddenly unable to talk it about when he is under oath."" ""Mr. Rove has given reasons for the firings that have now been shown to be inaccurate, after-the-fact fabrications,"" Leahy said in a statement issued Wednesday evening. ""Yet he now refuses to tell this committee the truth about his role in targeting well-respected U.S. attorneys for firing and in seeking to cover up his role and that of his staff in the scandal."" Mark Paoletta, a lawyer for Jennings, told CNN his client will appear before the Judiciary Committee but would refuse to answer questions he feels are covered by executive privilege. Former White House political director Sara Taylor testified under similar circumstances in July. The White House already has invoked executive privilege to block previous testimony by Taylor and former White House counsel Harriet Miers, who skipped a hearing in the House two weeks ago, and to keep Chief of Staff Josh Bolten from turning over documents subpoenaed as part of the inquiry. The panel voted to cite Miers and Bolten for contempt of Congress for failing to comply with subpoenas. The decision on whether to pursue any action on those citations lies with the Justice Department. The privilege claim can be challenged in court. But Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, has said the courts would be unlikely to resolve any challenge before Bush leaves office. Vice President Dick Cheney dismissed the congressional investigation of the attorney firings as a ""witch hunt"" during a CNN interview Tuesday. Democratic congressional leaders, however, say administration officials have been unable to answer their most basic questions -- who compiled the list of prosecutors to be dismissed, and why were they selected? While the Bush administration has maintained that the prosecutors' firings were handled properly, the controversy has led to the resignations of at least three top Justice Department officials and triggered widespread criticism of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who repeatedly told a Senate committee in April that he did not recall details of the firings. Critics say the attorneys were forced out for political reasons, such as for failing to bring voter fraud cases pushed by Republican activists, and administration officials have acknowledged that one was fired to allow a Rove protege to take a post in Arkansas.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A distraught, sobbing Afghan Taliban member begged the court for mercy, but got none as an unmoved federal judge here Monday handed down maximum life sentences for convictions on drug trafficking and narco-terrorism charges. A guard watches over a pile of burning drugs in Kabul, Afghanistan, on June 25, 2008. Khan Mohammed, 38, of Nangarhar Province became the first person convicted and sentenced in the United States under a 2006 law that increased the penalty for a defendant found to be involved  with terrorism and distributing illegal drugs. Mohammed, who had been extradited from Afghanistan, was convicted by a jury in May of plotting a rocket attack on U.S. military forces and Afghan civilians at Jalalabad Airfield. He also was found guilty of distributing between $1 million and $3 million worth of heroin into the United States ""to kill Americans as part of a jihad."" Mohammed's court-appointed lawyer, conceding that ""what he did was wrong,"" urged U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to be lenient and sentence his client to only 20 years in prison. Then the full-bearded Mohammed, dressed in an orange jailhouse jumpsuit, addressed the judge. With tears streaming down his face, and choking back his words, he begged for only one or two years. ""I have little children and a woman. They depend on me,"" Mohammed began. ""I'm so worried about them."" His lengthy emotional appeal went on to include his reason for selling opium. ""In my village that's how you have to make a living. There is no house there without opium,"" he said. Justice Department prosecutor Matthew Stiglitz, however, urged the court to ""send a message of deterrence,"" and warned against ""the confluence of drug trafficking and terrorism."" ""No, he's not the Osama bin Laden of terrorism. No, he's not the Pablo Escobar of the drug world,"" Stiglitz told the judge. ""But this is where the rubber meets the road."" Bin Laden is the head of al Qaeda, while Escobar, who died in 1993, was the most powerful of Colombian drug lords. ""Afghanistan is ground zero for opium, and an almost limitless source of funds to the Taliban,"" he argued. Kollar-Kotelly agreed fully with the prosecutors, and strongly admonished the Taliban defendant. ""You were convicted 99 percent by your own words,"" the judge declared, as she recalled how a ""courageous"" Afghan police chief wore an undercover wire to record Mohammed's plotting. ""The fact that no one died is only because you didn't get the missiles you wanted,"" she said. ""In 2006, you celebrated the Americans' use of the opium. It was a jihad. You knew the damage it could cause,"" the judge continued. ""Because of your undiluted hatred for the United States, you might well have launched other attacks had you not been arrested."" She added, ""Terrorists stand unique among criminals. Deterrence is very important here."" Then, concluding dramatically, the judge turned directly to the defendant. ""I heard your concerns for your family but no acceptance of responsibility for your action,"" the judge said. ""Defendants often express worry for their families, but if they considered the consequences of their actions beforehand, maybe they would have acted differently.""","Khan Mohammed convicted of plotting rocket attack, selling heroin .

"(CNN) -- Harold Pinter, the Nobel Prize-winning playwright and screenwriter whose absurdist and realistic works displayed a despair and defiance about the human condition, has died, according to British media reports. He was 78. The much-honored Harold Pinter received the French Legion d'honneur in 2007. Pinter's wife, Lady Antonia Fraser, confirmed his death. Pinter, who had been suffering from cancer, died on Christmas Eve, according to the reports. Fraser told the Guardian newspaper: ""He was a great, and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years. He will never be forgotten."" Pinter was known for such plays as ""The Birthday Party"" (1957), ""The Homecoming"" (1964), ""No Man's Land"" (1974), ""Mountain Language"" (1988), and ""Celebration"" (2000). The works caught a linguistic rhythm -- the legendary ""Pinter pause"" -- and an air of social unease that resonated throughout the English-speaking world and in myriad translations. His movie credits, like his plays, span the decades and include ""The Quiller Memorandum"" (1965) and ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" (1981). Pinter also wrote the screenplay for his 1978 play ""Betrayal,"" the story of a doomed love affair told backward, which was made into a 1983 film with Ben Kingsley, Jeremy Irons and Patricia Hodge. He received the Nobel Prize in literature in 2005. Pinter's later plays were more overtly political, with works such as ""One for the Road"" (1984) and ""The New World Order"" (1991) focusing on state torture. In commentaries, he became a blistering critic of the United States, writing in his Nobel lecture that the country ""quite simply doesn't give a damn about the United Nations, international law or critical dissent, which it regards as impotent and irrelevant. It also has its own bleating little lamb tagging behind it on a lead, the pathetic and supine Great Britain."" But Pinter could also be a man of great humor. In 2006, he recounted a story about a fall that had landed him in the hospital a year earlier. ""Two days later, I woke up to find that I'd been given the Nobel Prize in literature,"" he said. ""So life is really full of ups and downs, you see."" Harold Pinter was born in London on October 10, 1930. He was the son of Jewish immigrants, his father a dressmaker, his mother ""a wonderful cook,"" he once recalled. In 1948 he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, then as now one of Great Britain's most renowned drama schools. But the RADA didn't take; Pinter hated the school and dropped out after two terms. He became an actor and turned to playwriting with his first work, ""The Room,"" in 1957. Later that year he wrote ""The Birthday Party,"" a ""comedy of menace,"" in the words of one critic, that helped make Pinter's reputation -- though, in an irony he could appreciate, after it closed in London due to scathing notices. Ensuing Pinter plays, including ""The Dumb Waiter"" (1957) and ""The Homecoming,"" made him Britain's most famous playwright, as influential to ""late 20th-century British theater [as] Tennessee Williams is to mid-century American stages,"" CNN.com's Porter Anderson wrote in 2006. ""What's generally meant as a 'Pinter play' in the purest sense usually revolves around one or more characters who are imposing on themselves a constricted, even deprived existence in order to hold off a presumed but uncertain threat,"" Anderson wrote. Pinter's plays featured sparse dialogue, often spiced with paranoia or simple befuddlement. In ""The Birthday Party,"" a boardinghouse resident is accosted by two malevolent visitors who insist it's his birthday; in ""The Homecoming"" -- which won the Tony Award for best play when it premiered on Broadway in 1967 -- a professor and his wife return to his working-class British family, where the wife becomes the center of attention. Pinter credited Samuel Beckett, among others, as an influence. (He starred in a production of Beckett's ""Krapp's Last Tape"" in 2006.) In turn, writers such as David Mamet and Sam Shepard followed Pinter's elliptical lead. ""One way of looking at speech is to say it is a constant stratagem to cover nakedness,"" Pinter once said. He was married first to the actress Vivien Merchant. Following a 1980 divorce, Pinter married writer-historian Lady Antonia Fraser.","Harold Pinter died on Christmas Eve, his wife tells British media .

"(CNN)  -- President-elect Barack Obama's victory speech Tuesday night  compares favorably with a number of historic orations, a linguist said Thursday. Barack Obama speaks at a rally in Chicago, Illinois, after winning the presidency Tuesday night. ""His goal was to be understood by the widest possible audience during his victory speech, and he seems to have done a great job doing it,"" said Paul J.J. Payack, president of the Austin, Texas-based Global Language Monitor, which analyzed the speech for content, tone and length. ""He's at his best communicating directly and forthrightly with this audience and using different types of rhetorical devices,"" Payack said, noting that the speech was written to a seventh- or eighth-grade level. That's lower than the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 ""I Have a Dream"" speech (grade 8.8), President Reagan's 1987 ""Tear Down This Wall"" speech (grade 9.8) and even Obama's own 2004 Democratic Convention speech (grade 8.3), Payack said. In the four years since then, ""he has learned to speak more directly and more succinctly when he's giving a major address,"" the word aficionado said. He spoke admiringly of Obama's repeated use of the phrase ""Yes, we can,"" calling it ""very effective."" ""That's a very short, direct sentence,"" Payack said. ""Almost like a drumbeat hammering into people's minds and hearts."" He added, ""something like that comes across as a very effective rhetorical device."" That phrase compares with Reagan's ""Tear Down This Wall"" and President Kennedy's ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,"" delivered in his inaugural speech. At about 2,000 words, the speech was short enough not to lose the audience's attention but long enough to cite specifics and cover the subject matter, Payack said.  Watch Obama's victory speech » . Twelve of those words were ""hope"" or variations of the word, which indicates optimism about the change (used nine times) he has promised to effect. Another 23 of the words were ""will,"" another way of making the speech forward-looking. Though most of Obama's verbs were in the active voice, 11 percent of the sentences were in the passive voice, a dependable method of deflecting responsibility, Payack said. He cited Obama's ""There will be setbacks and false starts"" as an example. ""He's spreading the responsibility around,"" Payack said. ""He didn't say, 'I will have setbacks. I will be wrong. I will make mistakes.' He used the passive voice for those types of constructions."" But the vast majority of the hopeful references were in the active voice, he said. ""It's very personal and very active. 'I promise we, as a people, will get there.' "" The speech was notable for what it omitted, too, Payack said. In this case, the absence of a reference to the September 11 terrorist attacks indicates a change in tone, he said. In his closing phrase, Obama repeats the mantra, ""Yes, we can,"" which serves as a call to action, an acknowledgment that the country faces hard work, Payack said. Obama is saying, ""I'm asking you to do something big, but we can do it together,"" Payack said. ""We are the change; we are the hope.""","Linguist says Obama's speech was on seventh- or eighth-grade level .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Subtlety may not be in Kevin Smith's vocabulary, but a lot of off-color words are. They're sprinkled liberally throughout the writer-director's new movie, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno."" Kevin Smith can't understand why the word ""porno"" is still a hot button for some people. The comedy stars Seth Rogen and Elizabeth Banks as roommates and longtime friends who decide that the solution to their money problems is to make a porn film. Strong language is nothing new for Smith, whose first film, ""Clerks,"" put him on the map with its merrily scatological musings. Though the film had little violence or exposed skin, it was initially given an NC-17 rating by the MPAA based on the language. ""Zack and Miri"" was also a possibility for an NC-17, considered the kiss of death by studios because of distributing and marketing challenges, until Smith argued its merits to the ratings board and received an R. Since ""Clerks,"" Smith's films have been almost wistfully romantic (""Chasing Amy,"" ""Jersey Girl"") or as joyfully profane as ""Clerks"" (""Dogma,"" ""Clerks II""). ""Zack and Miri,"" which opens Friday, is a blend of the two Smiths: full of sex and colorful language, but with a sweet side. Indeed, Banks told CNN not to be fooled by the film's tawdry talk. ""Kevin Smith is a huge romantic,"" she said. ""He likes to wrap up the romance in profanity, but the guy is more sweet than spicy.""  Watch why ""Zack and Miri"" is so controversial » . In an interview with CNN, Smith, 38, cheerfully acknowledged that this is not a film for prudes. The following is an edited version of the conversation. Kevin Smith: There's a bit of language in this picture. I'm not going to lie to you. ... I don't even think of it as salty. To me, it's just like part of a lexicon. CNN: Well, you do hear it a lot. Smith: Yeah, yeah, yeah, no doubt. We're raising our kid in a household where people curse, as an experiment. And I think our experiment is working, because I don't tame my language around the kid. I don't run up to her and yell [expletive] in her face, but I don't go out of my way to like not curse in front of her. And honestly, ironically, she doesn't curse. And I've tried to get her to curse for like friends and family, because it's always entertaining to hear a child curse, and she doesn't do it. CNN: Well ... I almost hesitate to ask, but tell me what the genesis was of the film. Smith: It's a movie I've been researching since I was like 12 years old, to be honest with you. And sometimes three or four times a day. ... But it only really came together when I saw Seth Rogen in ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" and instantly fell in love with him and was like, ""I got to work with this guy."" ... So I started thinking about this movie, and immediately it kind of crystallized. Seeing Seth and thinking about porn, I was like, boom, ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno."" I wrote the script with him in mind. And by the time I finished with it, ""Knocked Up"" was about to open, and the word was it was going to be huge, so I was like, we missed our window. This guy's going to be famous, and he'll want nothing to do with this movie. But I sent him an e-mail anyway where I said, ""Look, man, I wrote this flick with you in mind. Please give it a read."" ... And I got an e-mail back within five minutes that said, ""When I first came to Los Angeles, an agent asked me what I wanted to do with my career. I said I wanted to be in a Kevin Smith movie. That has not changed. Please send me the script; I would be honored to read it."" And I was, I was like cha-ching! You know, my God, it worked out. CNN: You're working with some professionals here, and by that I don't mean Seth and Elizabeth. I mean working with actual people with porn experience. Smith: We got ourselves a former pro. ... Traci Lords, man. Who, for the last 20 years, has not made an adult film. Has been keeping that industry at arm's length as she concentrates on a mainstream career and her musical career and stuff like that. But you know, it just seemed like if we're going to make this movie, Traci Lords would just fit into it so well. We approached her agent, and her agent was like, I don't know, it's got ""porno"" in the title, she ain't going to want to do it. Then she heard that Seth was in it, and she heard that I was making it, and so she was like, well, I'll at least read it. She came over to my house and read it. And I remember, I was sitting downstairs while she was upstairs reading it, and I was like, if I could go back in time and tell the 16-year-old version of me that Traci Lords is going to be hanging out in your living room ... my 16-year-old head would explode. First, the 16-year-old would be like, where'd you get a time machine, and then the 16-year-old would be like, does she want to have sex with us, and then I'd have to break it to the 16-year-old that, no, Traci Lords -- even many years from now -- [is] still not interested in your fat ass. So, she loved the material. ... Maybe it's time to embrace it and make fun of it. I said yeah, please do it. Katie Morgan is still active in the adult film industry, and she brought a kind of a current vision to it. She was able to kind of tell me where to put the camera to make things look as convincing as possible. So I was like, wow, man, this chick who most people know from porn has taught me how to direct. So if the movie looks any better than my normal stuff, it's probably because of Katie Morgan. iReport.com: Will you see 'Zach and Miri'? CNN: The title has created some challenges in terms of the marketing, that some newspapers are not taking ads for it and some buses and what have you. What do you make of that? Smith: I think it's strange that in this day and age, the 21st century, that people are hung up on a word, and the word is ""porno."" It's not like we put salacious posters out there. ... The poster is literally stick figures. ... People are afraid like, what if my kid asks what porno is? Just tell them. Tell your kid that the porno's not for you. My kid asked me what a porno is, I'm going to be like, guess what? Hannah Montana is not in it. Not yet. Are you still interested? Of course she's not interested in it, because it has nothing to do with her world. So I just think its kind of sad that like some people lobby against it. Like, based on the dude who called in, or the many people that called in after the Dodgers ran a spot. ... Just tell your kid, man; just be honest with them. It's like, look, [the] movie's not for you. ... It's crazy to me, because it's like, some people think that it's real porn that's being advertised. Can you tell me the last porno that you saw that had the word ""porno"" in the title? Like, it doesn't exist. I don't think it's ever existed. CNN: I understand that you were able to convince the MPAA to give you an R rating. Did that require any cuts? And if not, were you surprised? Smith: Initially, I was kind of surprised that they gave us the NC-17. Especially because the two areas they focused on were easily addressed: one ... they felt [was] gratuitous thrusting in the first porno sequence between Katie Morgan and Jason Mewes, and the other was what we'll call the egregious bodily fluid shot. ... I was able to go to the appeals process with the film, where you show it to a different audience. ... [You] screen it for [theater owners], and then you get up and do 15 minutes on why you feel it should be an R. Joan Graves [of] the MPAA gets up and does 15 minutes on why she feels it's an NC-17, then you get 10 minutes to rebut, she gets 10 minutes to rebut. You leave the room, and that audience makes the vote. ... You have to win by a two-thirds majority [to have the rating changed]. And they changed the rating. [The] appeals group that we screened for ... flipped it, gave us an R. And I didn't have to make a single cut, so everything I wanted in the movie is in the movie. That's kind of cool as a filmmaker. CNN: Your own presidential debate. Smith: A little bit. ... It was kind of like ""Inherit the Wind,"" but about porn, not the Scopes Monkey Trial.","Kevin Smith is a fan of being bluntly honest .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Kept in a derelict warehouse at Baghdad's airport for months, sleeping four to a bed with poor food and no money, hundreds of would-be contract workers are stranded, claiming they were duped by unscrupulous recruiting agents into coming to Iraq for nonexistent jobs. Men staying in an airport warehouse say they paid recruiters to take them to Iraq, believing they'd get jobs. The recruiters told the men -- from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Uganda -- that jobs were waiting for them with American defense contractor KBR, through a Kuwaiti company called Najlaa Catering Services. The recruiting agents charged them between $3,000 and $5,000 to make the trip to Iraq; many sold their farms or other valuables to raise the money. But when they arrived in Baghdad, they said, Najlaa housed about 1,000 of them -- 600 in the one-room warehouse -- in the compound within the airport, surrounded by private security guards. Showers are there, but are useless because the taps are nonfunctional. Many have questions about their visas and status in Iraq. Legally unable to stay, they lack the money to return home. Asked if their governments were helping them, the men said, ""Nothing, nothing."" They said that when they protested, their guards fired guns upward to silence them.  Watch footage of the men, warehouse » . Najlaa's officials in Iraq refused comment to CNN. The company's Kuwaiti office said the situation was ""under control"" and being dealt with. Some Ugandan men said the Iraqi police handcuffed and beat them. ""They say, 'If you are here for the U.S., we're going to show you the difference between the U.S. government and the Iraqi government. Let's see if the U.S. is going to help you,' "" one man said. Iraqi police would not answer questions regarding those allegations. As the men spoke to CNN on camera, an official in charge of them threatened to lock them out of the compound unless they returned inside within two minutes. KBR was not involved in recruiting the men. The company told CNN it does not condone unethical behavior, saying its contractors abide by its code of conduct, including training in human trafficking. The company said when it becomes aware of possible trafficking it works ""to remediate the problem and report the matter to proper authorities. KBR then works with authorities to rectify the matter."" Meanwhile, men at a separate makeshift camp nearby said they were duped by different recruiters. They live off food donated by Iraqi workers, and say the men who brought them to Iraq have disappeared. The men in the makeshift camp said their immigration status is in limbo. Their passports have been taken, or pages with visas have been torn out. Help may be on the way. The men said United Nations workers had visited them. The world organization told CNN it is aware of the situation and is figuring out how to assist the men. The U.S. military told CNN it takes human rights abuses seriously and is looking into the matter. The Iraqi government has also confiscated the passport of a Najlaa official until a solution is found. But for the stranded men, help can't come soon enough. ""It's not fair,"" one said.

"(CNN) -- Andrew McMahon always wanted to be a rock star. When his band, Jack's Mannequin, started touring in spring 2005, the unexpected happened. Andrew McMahon, singer for the band Jack's Mannequin, was diagnosed with leukemia in 2005. McMahon was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Four years later, McMahon, now 26, is still at it. He has a new album out called ""The Glass Passenger"" and has taken the driver's seat in starting a cancer research organization, the Dear Jack Foundation. CNN's Nicole Lapin spoke with McMahon about living and working with cancer and now singing about it. The following is an edited transcript of the interview.  Watch Andrew McMahon's entire interview » . Nicole Lapin: For those people who don't know, you were formerly the front man for Something Corporate. When you started touring there, you had a bout with leukemia. When you were 22, you were diagnosed. What happened there? You first thought it was just fatigue, but it was something a lot worse. Andrew McMahon: Yeah, I was on the road. It was actually Jack's [Mannequin's] first tour; we had actually just finished recording ""Everything in Transit,"" which was my first record apart from Something Corporate. I was on the road and just kept losing my voice. It was just this thing that I couldn't figure out. I always had kind of this really durable voice and was known for being able to go out all night and wake up the next morning and be signing like a bird. Sure enough, I went to my voice doctor in New York City after having to cancel a show, and he thought I looked pale and didn't think I looked well, and he took my blood. They sent me to the hospital for more tests, and I found out the next week [that I had leukemia]. Lapin: But you kept touring. McMahon: No, after that point I was in the hospital. I started in New York and eventually flew back here and was treated at UCLA by a great doctor there. I spent the better part of six to eight months kind of battling back from that. I had a stem cell transplant from my sister in that period of time, and I eventually got back on the road the following summer.","Andrew McMahon is the lead singer for Jack's Mannequin .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British bank Lloyds TSB has agreed to forfeit $350 million dollars to U.S. and New York authorities for criminally hiding information about prohibited dealings with Iranian and Sudanese customers. Prosecutors said that the bank's misconduct took place between 1995 and 2007. Under a settlement reached in a federal court in Washington late Friday, Lloyds acknowledged criminal conduct and forfeited $175 million to U.S. authorities and an equal amount to New York authorities. Court documents say for more than a decade Lloyds had been falsifying data which moved through U.S. institutions by ""stripping out"" of wire transfers any references to business deals involving customers in the two countries. Lloyds officials acknowledged they feared if the U.S. had been aware of the deals they would likely have been blocked because of restrictions on commercial deals with Iran and Sudan. ""For more than 12 years Lloyd's facilitated the anonymous movement of hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S.-sanctioned nations through our financial system,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich. ""Lloyds stripped identifying information from international wire transfers that would have raised a red flag at U.S. financial institutions and caused such payments to be scrutinized,"" he said. Although the money must be forfeited, under terms of the deal Lloyds will not presently be prosecuted because it accepted responsibility and has vowed to abide by the U.S. laws. After two years the U.S. will forego prosecution and formally drop the criminal charge. In a statement, the bank said: ""We committed substantial resources to a thorough internal investigation, the results of which were shared with U.S. investigators and regulators. ""We are committed to running our business with the highest levels of integrity and regulatory compliance across all of our operations and have undertaken a range of significant steps to further enhance our compliance programs."" In October, the British government agreed a deal with Lloyds TSB, HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland to make a multi-billion investment in the three to help them through what Prime Minister Gordon Brown described as the ""first financial crisis of the global age.""","Bank accused of helping customers in Sudan and Iran avoid U.S. sanctions .

"(CNN) -- Nearly eight years later, Connie Chung still remembers being surprised. ""Stonewalling is what gets politicians in trouble, when they ... try to cover up,"" Connie Chung says. It was one of those television moments that linger in the national consciousness, like Barbara Walters sitting down with Monica Lewinsky, Dan Rather with Saddam Hussein, or Jay Leno asking Hugh Grant what the hell he had been thinking. Chung was with ABC then, and she got the ""get"" -- the first interview with Gary Condit, the California congressman at the center of the Chandra Levy media frenzy. The former Washington intern, you'll recall, had been found murdered in Rock Creek Park, and law enforcement sources let it be known that the married Condit had been having an affair with her. In an interview airing Sunday on ""Reliable Sources"" (10 a.m. ET, during CNN's ""State of the Union with John King""), Chung says she was surprised when Condit refused to acknowledge the romantic relationship. ""Stonewalling is what gets politicians in trouble, when they stonewall or they try to cover up,"" she says. ""I think that the general public and the news media wanted him to be honest, and if he could be honest about that part of the story, then he could be -- then he would be believed when he was answering other questions as to whether or not he had anything to do with her disappearance."" I often focus on media excess and media mistakes on the program, but we also try to highlight good journalism. The segment includes two Washington Post reporters, Sari Horwitz and Scott Higham, who cracked the Levy mystery in a 13-part series last year. They did what the D.C. police could not: They identified Ingmar Guandique, an illegal Salvadoran immigrant, as Levy's likely killer. Authorities issued an arrest warrant for the imprisoned suspect this week. But Horwitz and Higham talk about how they were roundly criticized for resurrecting the case and accused of sensationalizing it. It's clear that Levy's case became a huge deal in 2001 because of the Condit connection. At the same time, Chung says, ""The news media had changed. This was the gradual evolution of what the news media was doing. There was flavor of the week, the story du jour."" The Levy frenzy became the precursor for the missing-women TV melodramas that followed: Laci Peterson, Stacy Peterson, Natalee Holloway. The stories of women who were not celebrities, whom no one had heard of before, became national soap operas because they drove cable and morning show ratings. At least, in Levy's case, the soap opera appears to be drawing to a close.","Congressman wouldn't admit affair with murdered former intern .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Western cinema's relationship with martial arts has been a rocky one. Like many genres, kung fu has drifted in and out of fashion, but it has never regained the same popularity as its glorious heyday in the early 1970s. There's nothing funny about either Bruce Lee or Chuck Norris. And they've got the fists to prove it. After breaking into the United States and Britain with TV hardmen like The Saint and The Green Hornet duffing up the occasional bad guy, the revolution really kicked in at the cinema. When Bruce Lee -- who had already made waves in America as the Green Hornet's karate chopping sidekick, Kato -- appeared in the Chinese-made ""Jing wu men,"" or ""Fist of Fury,"" he established himself as the genre's poster boy. Lee found initial success in his native China, but with his next movies, ""Meng long guo jiang"" (""The Way of the Dragon""), which pitted him against U.S. karate champion Chuck Norris, and the classic ""Enter the Dragon,"" he became an international star. The plots of his films all followed a set structure: our gifted hero pursues a path of revenge or tough justice, accompanied by a stiff dose of morality. In this way his characters became representatives and protectors of the less powerful who have been unjustly treated. At the same time, the U.S. TV show ""Kung Fu,"" which started in 1972, raised the profile of martial arts, and, through the lead character Caine, built an image of the patient, wise man, who uses his skills in combat as a last resort when reasoning fails, and again, is motivated entirely by his unshakeable morals. The reluctant hero isn't a new concept: he's shared by the Far East and Wild West. The lone gunman in a western, too, tends to be loath to kill, and acts as the moral enforcer in a lawless place. But while the gunman in an isolated western town still commands the same respect from movie audiences as he lays down the law, our wise eastern mystic has almost entirely disappeared from Hollywood. The biggest martial arts stars today -- with the notable exception of Jet Li, who continues to take on a mix of serious art movies in China and gang-war films set on the streets of urban America -- are either laughed at or laughed with by western audiences. Kung fu superstar Jackie Chan has the impressive reputation of being almost indestructible. He does his own stunts and puts himself in some incredibly dangerous situations. But Chan is essentially a comedian. His stunts are used, in a very similar way to Chan's cinematic hero Harold Lloyd, to amaze and amuse an audience. We are shocked that someone could do the things he does, hanging off moving buses with a walking stick, leaping across buildings. He is almost superhuman, but it's done mainly for laughs. The other major kung fu stars have become figures of mockery. The Internet was awash with Chuck Norris gags pointing out just how strong he is (""Chuck Norris does not sleep. He waits."") while Steven Seagal has done himself no favors by appearing in some of the worst films ever made. Hollywood doesn't take them seriously -- and nor do we. Directors have also mocked the 70s obsession with kung fu that gripped the western world, with heroes from films such as ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Austin Powers"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"" fighting with cod seriousness while displaying laughable skills. So what has changed? Kung fu is not inherently funny. No matter how many times you watch ""Enter the Dragon,"" it never ceases to be awe-inspiring. Perhaps the answer is simple: we Hollywood film junkies have grown cynical. There is no room in our modern world for an unexplained, almost supernatural power against pointlessly evil adversaries. Have we have lost our ability to suspend our disbelief? So what can a real fan do? Are we condemned to trawling the movies of the 1970s in order to get our kung fu hit, harking back to a time when Chuck Norris really was feared and respected everywhere he went? The answer is no. While Hollywood seems to have dumped its one-time darling, kung fu is alive and flourishing in Asia, where it all started. Jet Li puts out some great offerings in China, and there is a rising star in the form of Tony Jaa, a Thai actor with amazing technical skill, whose films like ""Ong Bak"" have wowed audiences across the world. While Hollywood misses a trick and spends all its time laughing at its most skillful martial artists, the industry in Asia is doing what it has always done: bringing us all the high kicks, karate chops and spinning nunchucks we could ever want.

"VIENNA, Virginia (CNN) -- The acting chief financial officer of mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac was found dead Wednesday morning at his home, police said. David Kellermann, acting CFO of Freddie Mac, was found dead on Wednesday, police said. David Kellermann was found dead of an apparent hanging, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. There were no signs of foul play when officers arrived at the home in Vienna shortly before 5 a.m., said Lucy Caldwell, a spokeswoman for police in Fairfax County, Virginia. She said the death ""may have been an apparent suicide."" A second Fairfax County police spokesman, Eddie Azcarate, said Kellermann's body was found in the basement. ""The exact cause of death ... we're going to wait for the medical examiner,"" he said. Police were called by someone inside the home, he said, but he didn't know who made the report.  Watch why police don't suspect foul play » . Family members remained in the home, and several visitors went inside. Freddie Mac has been immersed in financial problems since last year, when the government took it over in the midst of the escalating subprime-mortgage loan crisis. Federal prosecutors in New York and Virginia have been investigating it, as has the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a March 11 company filing. Sharon McHale, Freddie Mac's vice president for public relations, issued a statement at midday, saying, ""Freddie Mac knows of no connection between David Kellermann's death and the regulatory inquiries that were discussed in our recent SEC filing."" Neighbors indicated there was no sign that Kellermann had problems. ""They were very friendly with all the young families in the neighborhood ... terrific people,"" said neighbor Paul Unger. ""We saw him when he was out working in the yard. ... We didn't spend a lot of time together."" ""We're beyond shocked,"" he said. ""He was a great family guy with a beautiful young child."" They had the most decorated home at Christmas, Unger added. ""I cannot imagine what has happened. ... This is a nightmare."" ""I asked the policeman what was going on and he told me. I was stunned, silent, shed tears. I feel terrible,"" Unger said. ""This is a solid, salt-of-earth kind of family ... and I just cannot imagine what would have driven him to it."" Another neighbor said the family was very ""community-oriented,"" and liked hosting parties at their house. ""We're very, very upset right now,"" said the woman, whose daughter baby-sat for the Kellermanns' 5-year-old daughter. ""This is just too much for us."" ""They were a very happy, happy couple. So it was a shock when we came upon it."" Kellermann, 41, was a man ""of great talents,"" Freddie Mac's interim CEO, John Koskinen, said in a written statement. ""He dedicated those talents to Freddie Mac for more than 16 years, serving in many business and finance capacities before recently taking the reins as acting chief financial officer. ""His extraordinary work ethic and integrity inspired all who worked with him. But he will be most remembered for his affability, his personal warmth, his sense of humor and his quick wit."" Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner offered his condolences in a written statement: ""On behalf of the Treasury family, we are deeply saddened by the news this morning of David Kellermann's death. Our deepest sympathies are with his family and his colleagues at Freddie Mac during this difficult time."" Freddie Mac was established by Congress in 1970 to provide liquidity, stability and affordability to the nation's residential mortgage markets. It supports communities across the nation by providing mortgage capital to lenders. Kellermann, who served as a senior vice president in addition to acting CFO, was named to those posts in September. He was responsible for the company's financial controls. This included overseeing financial reporting, compliance with tax requirements and regulations, and annual budgeting and financial planning. Before assuming his current posts, Kellermann was corporate controller and principal accounting officer. According to the March 11 company filing, Freddie Mac was subpoenaed for documents relating to accounting, disclosure and corporate governance matters in September, October, January and February. The filing also says that SEC staff was interviewing company employees. The government took over Freddie Mac last year. In September, it and Fannie Mae were placed under conservatorship by their regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Both companies back mortgages held by private homeowners, and have received massive cash infusions from the government to keep them afloat. Kellermann held a master's degree in finance from George Washington University and a bachelor's in political science and accounting from the University of Michigan. He had served as a volunteer board member of the District of Columbia Coalition for the Homeless. ""We at [the Federal Housing Finance Agency] are very saddened by the death of David Kellermann,"" the agency said in a written statement. ""As the acting chief financial officer of Freddie Mac during particularly challenging times, David was an inspiration to his staff and many others who were privileged to work with him."" A spokesman for the SEC declined to comment. As part of its rescue of Freddie and Fannie last year, the government made $100 billion available to each to cover future losses -- amounts that President Obama has since doubled. In March, Freddie reported that it had asked the government for $30.8 billion after losing $50 billion in 2008. Nearly the entire loss came in the second half of the year, following the government takeover, and the company's losses deepened as the housing market continued its decline. CNN's Kate Bolduan contributed to this report.","NEW: Freddie Mac says no known link between CFO's death, regulatory probe .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Masks beneath masks, the click-clack of Mahjong tiles and the sheen of silk cheongsams: Taiwanese director Ang Lee (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""; ""Brokeback Mountain"") brings an intoxicating tale of lies, deceit and corruption to the screen with his latest film, ""Lust, Caution"". Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Tang Wei star in Ang Lee's latest film, ""Lust, Caution"" Japanese-occupied Shanghai, 1942. Mrs Mak, an impeccably coiffed Chinese lady, makes a telephone call from a cafe, then sits and waits. Cue a flashback to 1938, where her story begins. Mrs Mak is not the sophisticate she appears -- just a few years earlier, she was shy drama student Wong Chia Chi. Ang Lee's adaptation of Eileen Chang's short story tells the tale of a girl caught up in the winds of change of World War II. The fast-paced erotic thriller tracks Wong Chia Chi's transformation from bookish student to collaborator bait. The film has already received wide acclaim, winning Lee his second Golden Lion at Venice with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Foreign Language Film already in the bag. ""Lust, Caution"" cleaned up at Taiwan's Golden Horse awards, scooping seven trophies including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, which went to Tony Leung Chiu Wai, and Best Newcomer, for Wei Tang. Wei Tang plays Wong Chia Chi, a student in Hong Kong whose fate is set when she meets Kuang Yu Min (Lee-hom Wang), a handsome fellow student who wants to use drama to provoke his compatriots to rebel against the Japanese. As Kuang's leading lady, Wong Chia Chi blossoms, but when Kuang urges his fellow players to move from inspiration to action, she finds herself at the center of a plot to ensnare and murder Japanese collaborator Mr Yee (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). Dressed in cheongsams and primped and curled to perfection, Wong Chia Chi sets out on the biggest role of her life. As Mrs Mak, she gains Lee's trust through his wife, and the plot progresses as planned until an unexpectedly fatal twist spurs her to flee. Cut to Shanghai three years later: Wong Chia Chi is caught in a listless existence when Kuang unexpectedly re-enters her life. He lures her back into the unfinished sting operation, and before long she and Mr Lee, now head of the collaborationist secret service, are engaged in a torrid affair that pushes her soul and her loyalty to the limit. Newcomer Wei Tang gives a startlingly assured and subtle performance. At times, she seems to mirror Wong Chia Chi's transformation into Mrs Mak from dowdy student to rouged mistress, but she rises to the challenge and ably carries the film on her slender shoulders. As she is thrust into the spotlight by Kuang, stripped mechanically of her virginity in readiness for her role as temptress, and placed alongside Mr Lee, Wei Tang, with serene stillness, lets Wong Chia Chi be swept along to her final destiny. Every diamond demands the right setting to sparkle, and Tony Leung Chiu Wai's generous performance as the enigmatic Mr Lee lets his co-star shine. Leung is pitch-perfect, and shows his quality as he lets Lee's beautifully impassive mask shift and slip, revealing a tightly-wound coil of repressed emotion beneath. Leung is remarkable: a highly skilled actor capable of expressing a world of emotion in the smallest muscle movement. The audience is left to imagine the horrors he unleashes during his interrogations of Chinese resistance fighters. The already-infamous sex scenes can appear a little clumsy and contorted at times, less intimate than acrobatic; it's when Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Wei Tang sit in silence that they most project how intimate and electric their connection really is. The lead characters are ably supported by a stirling cast, most notably a splendidly nuanced performance from Joan Chen as Mrs Lee, forced to turn a blind eye to her husband's affairs, both in business and of the heart, while Asian pop superstar Wang Leehom gives a convincing and impassioned performance as romantic, ruthless Kuang. As for the ambience, Ang Lee is known for his attention to detail, and at times the 30s luxe and glamour is perhaps a little too perfect, a little too glossy, with a depth of style usually reserved for more placid period pieces. (Note for fashionistas: while ""Atonement"" might inspire a 2008 trend for bias-cut 30s dresses, ""Lust, Caution"" will add perfectly formed cloche hats and cocktail rings to the mix.) But this chilling, thrilling film-noir-inspired tale is both poised and elegant, bloody and erotic; if not quite a diamond the size of a quail's egg, ""Lust, Caution"" is certainly a precious pearl of a movie.

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- An Italian woman who had been in a coma for 17 years and whose right-to-die case was being debated in the Italian Parliament has died days after doctors began removing her feeding tube. A portrait of Eluana Englaro. She was in a vegetative state for nearly 17 years. The speaker of the Italian Senate announced the death of Eluana Englaro, 37, Monday night, then called for a moment of silence in the chamber. Even as the silence ended, one legislator declared, ""She has not died -- she was killed,"" prompting other right-to-die opponents to join in with calls of ""Murderers!"" Englaro had been in a vegetative state for 17 years, after suffering what doctors determined to be irreversible brain damage in a 1992 car crash, when she was 20 years old. For years, Englaro's father, Beppino, fought to have her feeding tube removed, saying it would be a dignified end to his daughter's life. He said that before the crash his daughter visited a friend who was in a coma and told him she didn't want the same thing to happen to her if she were ever in the same state. Confirming his daughter's death Monday, Beppino Englaro told Italian media: ""Yes, she is no longer with us, but I don't want to say anything further. I need to be left alone."" But the intense debate swirling around her case will go on.  Watch as Italians protest against her death » . When Englaro's death was announced, the Senate was debating a proposed law that would require doctors to provide nourishment to all incapacitated patients, and that would have forced doctors to resume feeding Englaro through tubes. Debate on that proposal as it would affect other patients is likely to continue in Parliament. Last year, a court ruled that the feeding tube could be removed, and Italy's high court upheld the ruling on appeal. Englaro was transferred last week to a private clinic, where the removal process began Friday -- even as the Senate took up a debate aimed at reversing that process. A decree aimed at preventing doctors from completely removing the feeding tube was passed unanimously Friday by Italy's Council of Ministers, with Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi leading the effort. ""I will do everything I can to save her life,"" Berlusconi said. ""We have to do everything possible to stop a person from dying."" But President Giorgio Napolitano refused to sign the decree. According to a statement from Napolitano's office, ""An emergency decree cannot be in contrast with a court decision."" The case has been a controversial one in Italy, a heavily Catholic country where the Vatican has great influence. Earlier this month, Pope Benedict XVI told pilgrims that ""euthanasia is a false solution to suffering."" Monsignor Elio Sgreccia, president emeritus of the Pontifical Academy for Life, said Friday that Englaro had the right to be kept alive. ""It is the duty of the doctors, of society, and of the political institutions to administer her essential foods to keep her alive. No one has the right to take her life away from her,"" he said. Euthanasia is illegal in Italy, but patients have the right to refuse treatment. It is on that basis that Englaro argued his daughter should be allowed to die, because some time before her accident she had expressed the wish not to be kept alive while in a coma -- indirectly refusing treatment, he said.","NEW: Woman in coma for 17 years in Italy has died, her father says .

"(CNN) -- President Obama takes his first foreign trip Thursday, but domestic politics will loom large as he tackles the explosive issue of protectionism in a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the leader of the United States' largest trade partner. Trade will be a major issue when President Obama visits Canada beginning Thursday. At issue is a controversial so-called ""Buy American"" provision requiring the use of U.S.-produced iron, steel, and other manufactured goods in public works projects funded by the $787 billion economic stimulus bill. Several Democratic-leaning unions and domestic steel and iron producers favor the provision; a large number of business and trade organizations are opposed. Administration officials altered the language in the final version of the stimulus bill to ensure that the provision will not trump existing trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA. Canadian companies will therefore still have the chance to sell products used in stimulus-funded projects. Canadian government officials, however, are still concerned by what they perceive as rising protectionist sentiment in the United States that could potentially spark a trade war and, in their opinion, deepen the global economic crisis. Canada has been hit hard by the global downturn. The country's critical manufacturing-based sales dropped 8 percent in December, reflecting roughly equal decreases in both volume and price, according to Statistics Canada, an agency charged with tracking key economic data for officials in Ottawa. In a recent letter to U.S. Senate leaders, Canada's ambassador to the United States warned that the U.S. was losing the moral authority to pressure other nations not to erect their own trade barriers. ""A rush to protectionist actions could create a downward spiral like the world experienced in the 1930s,"" wrote Ambassador Michael Wilson. ""In the end we got into this economic crisis together. We need to work together to build ourselves out of it."" Some Canadian leaders also cite unresolved concerns over what they perceive to be vague and potentially harmful language in the ""Buy American"" provision. Specifically, they are questioning whether NAFTA and World Trade Organization rules will apply to state and city governments receiving stimulus money for local infrastructure projects. They also cite uncertainty over what rules of origin apply to projects covered under the stimulus bill. A number of components in Canadian products come from countries such as China and India, which are effectively excluded by the ""Buy American"" provision. ""This is no merely technical question; different parts of many products come from different places, and intricately entwined supply chains could be seriously disturbed if they have to be disentangled, to the detriment of both the U.S. and Canada,"" the Toronto-based Globe and Mail newspaper editorialized Tuesday. ""Such questions cannot wait for judgments in trade litigation,"" the Globe and Mail argued. ""Canadian governments and businesses ... have to be ready for a long series of many minor battles."" Obama stumbled over Canadian trade issues during last year's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Shortly before the Ohio primary in March, he was extremely critical of NAFTA. Many Rust Belt voters believe the accord has cost countless jobs by accelerating the erosion of the U.S. industrial base. During a debate with then-Sen. Hillary Clinton, Obama agreed that the United States should abandon the treaty if it could not be renegotiated. It was later revealed that one of Obama's economic advisers, Austan Goolsbee, had met with officials at Canada's Chicago, Illinois, consulate and allegedly assured them that Obama's trade rhetoric was more a function of politics than any deeply held policy position.","President Obama leaves for Canada on Thursday; to meet with Canadian PM Harper .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A female suicide bomber Friday detonated in a crowd of mostly women and children on their way to a religious festival, killing at least 38 people and wounding 50 others, an Interior Ministry official said. Devout Shia Muslims walk in Baghdad towards the holy city of Karbala. The attack took place around noon between the towns of Iskandariya and Mussayib, south of the capital, Baghdad, as hundreds of thousands of Shia pilgrims are making their way to Karbala for Arbaeen, one of the holiest Shiite events. Ten of those injured are in critical condition. The suicide attack comes on the heels of other bombings targeting Shiite pilgrims earlier in the week and are signs that the sectarian conflicts that devastated Iraq in recent years are not over. An explosion in Karbala on Thursday killed at least five Shiite pilgrims and wounded 50 near a shrine. On Wednesday, a double car bombing struck a Baghdad bus station where Shiite pilgrims gathered for the holy day. Sixteen people were killed and 43 were wounded. Also, two pilgrims were killed and 16 were wounded Wednesday in roadside bombings in Baghdad. The holy day commemorates the end of a 40-day mourning period for Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed and one of the most revered Shiite figures. He died in battle in the seventh century and is buried in Karbala. In recent years, insurgents have targeted Shiite pilgrims, who usually walk to Karbala from across Iraq as a demonstration of piety and as part of tradition. The city is about 60 miles (100 km) southwest of Baghdad. Last year, a flurry of attacks on pilgrims killed at least 48 people. In 2007, more than 180 pilgrims were killed in a series of attacks, most from suicide bombings in Babil province, through which the pilgrims pass.

Othman al-Ghanemi. CNN's Yousil Bassil contributed to this report.","Female suicide bomber detonates in a crowd on way to a religious festival .

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- The international group Human Rights Watch is accusing Israel of firing weapons containing white phosphorus into Gaza. The group demands that the alleged practice cease. Israel is declining to say whether bursts like this over Gaza involve white phosphorus. The group's  researchers in Israel ""observed multiple air-bursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over what appeared to be the Gaza City/Jabaliya area"" on Friday and Saturday, the organization said on its Web site. ""Israel appeared to be using white phosphorus as an 'obscurant' [a chemical used to hide military operations], a permissible use in principle"" under the laws of war, the HRW posting said. ""However, white phosphorus has a significant, incidental, incendiary effect that can severely burn people and set structures, fields, and other civilian objects in the vicinity on fire,"" the posting said. ""The potential for harm to civilians is magnified by Gaza's high population density, among the highest in the world."" HRW said the use of white phosphorus in Gaza would violate ""the requirement under international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injury and loss of life."" Last week, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN: ""I can tell you with certainty that white phosphorus is absolutely not being used."" Now, however, Israeli officials have a different response to questions about the possible use of phosphorus: ""Any munitions that Israel is using are in accordance with international law. Israel does not specify the types of munitions or the types of operations it is conducting."" Still, a doctor familiar with the material said it is not possible to tell, based on pictures of burns, whether white phosphorus was responsible. ""Dead tissue pretty much looks the same,"" said Dr. Peter Grossman, president of the Grossman Burn Center in Sherman Oaks, California. The chemical ""can burn down houses and cause horrific burns when it touches the skin,"" said Marc Garlasco, senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch. Since January 3, when Israel began its ground offensive in Gaza, news reports have circulated about the possible use of white phosphorus by the IDF. HRW's assertion was supported by munitions experts and some Palestinian doctors, including Nafiz Abu Sha'aban, who said the burns it caused were unlike anything he has seen in 27 years of practice. Watch footage of burn patients in Gaza . Though most severely burned patients have been sent to Egypt, the ongoing fighting has made it impossible to evacuate all of them, including one man with deep burns over 47 percent of his body, the doctor said. White phosphorus is known to burn flesh down to the bone. It's intended to provide illumination or to create a smokescreen in battle. Under an international protocol ratified by Israel in 1995, the use of such incendiary weapons is allowed when ""not specifically designed to cause burn injury to persons."" There is no prohibition per se against white phosphorus in conflict. But the timing and location of its use are restricted. For example, it is illegal under the protocol to use white phosphorus against any personnel, civilian or military. It can be directed only against military targets. International law says incendiary weapons cannot be used where civilians are concentrated. A house north of Gaza City was hit Sunday by something that observers contend may have been white phosphorus. ""It's been burning since one o'clock in the morning,"" Munir Hammada told CNN 11 hours later. ""If you move it with your feet, it reignites. You can't put it out with water, only sand."" Those characteristics match the properties of white phosphorus, which ignites on contact with air.","Researchers in Israel saw bursts of white phosphorus over Gaza, group says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with public health officials in 42 states to determine the cause of an outbreak of a particular type of salmonella called Typhimurium. Salmonella bacteria are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods. According to CDC sources, at least 388 people have been infected with this strain since September 3, but most cases occurred between October 1 and December 31, the disease agency said. About 18 percent of cases were hospitalized as a result of their illness, and patients have ranged from two months to 98 years of age. California is reporting the highest case count with 55, followed by Ohio with 53 cases, Massachusetts with 39, Minnesota with 30 and Michigan with 20. The other 37 states are each reporting anywhere from one to 19 cases. The eight states that have not reported any cases connected to the outbreak are Montana, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Florida, Alaska and Hawaii. King Nut peanut butter was identified as the source of an outbreak that may have contributed to one death in Minnesota, state public health officials said Friday in a news release. CNN was unable to reach the company for comment. CDC has not identified what food or foods might be causing this outbreak. CDC officials and state public health workers are conducting case control studies, which means they're tracking down people who have been infected as early as September to determine what they may have consumed, to find a common cause.  Learn more about salmonella » . The Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. Department of Agriculture are in contact with the CDC, but without a determination of the cause of the outbreak, their involvement is limited. Various strains of salmonella have been linked to previous outbreaks, caused by contaminated eggs, meat, poultry, vegetables, pet food and even peanut butter. Contaminated tomatoes were blamed for a salmonella Typhimurium outbreak in fall 2006, which sickened at least 183 people in 21 states. Most of the victims had diarrhea and fever for about a week. Nobody died in that outbreak. Salmonella infections are caused by bacteria and if necessary can be treated with antibiotics, although some strains have become resistant to these drugs, according to the CDC Web site. Most people infected will develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within a few days of infection, and their illness can last up to a week. Most recover without any treatment, but some may suffer dehydration and in severe cases require hospitalization. The youngest and oldest patients and chronically ill people with compromised immune systems are at highest risk for severe complications, according to the National Institutes of Health. Until a cause of the outbreak is confirmed, the CDC is recommending the following: . Consumers should thoroughly cook meats, poultry and eggs. They should also avoid consuming raw or unpasteurized milk and other dairy products. Produce should be thoroughly washed as well. Avoid cross-contamination of uncooked meats and produce to prevent spreading any potential salmonella. Frequent washing of hands during food preparation can also help reduce cross-contamination.","At least 388 people infected with strain of salmonella since September 3 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Karma caught up with former Culture Club singer Boy George on Friday when a court sentenced the star to 15 months for falsely imprisoning a male escort, a court spokeswoman said. George O'Dowd, also known as Boy George, arrives at Snaresbrook Crown Court, in east London. Full details of the sentence weren't immediately clear. A jury unanimously found the pop star and DJ, whose real name is George O'Dowd, guilty of the charge last month after a seven-day trial at Snaresbrook Crown Court in northeast London. The jury determined O'Dowd, 47, had chained male escort Audun Carlsen to a wall at his apartment in London's hip Shoreditch neighborhood. Carlsen had also said the singer beat him with a metal chain.  Watch as Boy George arrives at court » . O'Dowd, who maintained his innocence, came to court Friday sporting a multicolored tattoo on his bald head, none of his trademark makeup, and a black winter coat. The star quit Culture Club in 1987 after a string of hits with the group, including ""Karma Chameleon,"" ""Do you really want to hurt me?"" and ""Church of the Poison Mind."" He has since become a DJ and revived his singing career, releasing a single last year called ""Yes we can,"" inspired by Barack Obama and featuring clips of the U.S. president-elect. O'Dowd is no stranger to the law. In August 2006, he spent five days cleaning the streets of Manhattan as part of a community service sentence for falsely reporting a break-in at his New York City home.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The death toll from an outbreak of hepatitis B in India's western Gujarat state reached 38 on Sunday as authorities prepared to begin a vaccination drive against the disease. Hepatitis-B patient Mahir Husain, center, is comforted at a hospital in Ahmedabad. Malayappan Thennarasa, the top administrator of the affected Sabarkantha district, told CNN the toll had climbed to 38 and that shots would be administered free of cost starting Monday. Health officials have recorded 125 cases of the infection in two weeks.   Authorities were carrying out raids at medical stores for bogus drugs and recycled syringes. Police have so far arrested five medical practitioners. One of them was charged Sunday with attempted murder. The doctor is accused of reusing syringes, Thennarasa said. Hepatitis B is a contagious liver disease resulting from infection with the hepatitis B virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It usually spreads through blood, semen, or other bodily fluids, often through sexual contact or sharing needles or syringes with an infected person. The disease can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, chronic illness resulting in long-term health problems or death, the CDC said.","An outbreak of contagious liver disease hepatitis B kills 38 people in India .

"(CNN)  -- Swedish golfer Henrik Stenson carded a solid 69 in the opening round of the WGC-CA Championship but it was his highly unusual recovery shot on the 12th on the Blue Monster course at Doral which raised more than a few eyebrows. Stenson did not leave much to the imagination with his Doral antics. Stenson stripped down to the bare essentials -- a pair of white boxer shorts -- before wading into the mud to hack out his ball after an wayward tee shot. The watching galleries could hardly believe their eyes as the tall Swede peeled off his clothes. ""Shirt, trousers, socks, shoes, hat, the lot was off,"" he told the Press Association. ""Because of the mud I couldn't really afford to play in any of my clothes as they would have been a real mess down the last six or so holes so I had no option,"" Stenson explained. After getting the ball back on to the fairway, Stenson eventually made a one-over par bogey on the hole when he could have dropped at least two shots by taking a drop. ""If you are saving a shot, that has to be worth taking your shirt and trousers,"" he added. What do you think of Stenson's cheeky recovery shot ? The incident proved the main talking point on the day that Tiger Woods made his return to strokeplay golf and 32-year-old Stenson jokingly said it might offer a new avenue for sponsorships. ""Absolutely, you never know, after this I might have a new endorsement with PlayGirl or something like that."" European Ryder Cup star Stenson is playing for the $1.4 million first prize in the tournament in Florida which has an elite 81-strong field. His recovery shot evoked memories of the last-hole drama at the 1999 British Open at Carnoustie when tournament leader Jean Van de Velde waded into the Barry Burn after taking off his shoes and socks. The Frenchman at least spared the blushes of the crowds by keeping on his clothes but he made a hash of hole and lost his chance of winning the famous major.","Henrik Stenson creates a stir with 'striptease' at top tournament in Florida .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida boy remains in stable condition just days after he found his parents' long-forgotten handgun in a closet and accidentally shot himself in the head. Police are deciding whether or not to charge parents after their son found a forgotten gun and shot himself. Sheriff's detectives in Pinellas County, Florida, near St. Petersburg, say the boy found the .25-caliber European semi-automatic handgun in a box in a closet in their home. ""They are dealing with this very tragic situation, and at this point, no charges have been filed,"" said Cecilia Barreda of the Pinellas County sheriff's office. His stepfather found Jacob Larson, 12, with a gunshot wound to the head Friday. The stepfather called 911. Police say the shooting took place between 7:40 a.m., when his mother, Tracy Newman, leaves for work, and about 11 a.m., when his stepfather, Joseph Newton, returns home. The boy normally goes to school about 8:30 a.m. ""A few years ago, they moved, and [the gun] was stored in the closet. The mother never checked it, never fired it,"" Barreda said. ""They told detectives that they forgot they had stored it in a box inside a closet. Both her and her husband forgot about it,"" she said. Newman told detectives that she received the gun six years ago from a former employer. Police say that both she and her husband are cooperating in the investigation into the incident. The sheriff's office says it's unlikely that they will face charges. Florida law prohibits a person from leaving a loaded firearm where a minor might have access to it. Prosecutors do have some discretion, and depending on what happens with the gun, charges ranging from a misdemeanor to a felony can be filed in the event of death or serious injury. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that 17 states have child firearm access protection and safe-storage laws. Chief Assistant State Attorney Bruce Bartlett says that although laws are needed, an accident with a firearm can be a greater penalty than any judge could ever hand down. ""Sometimes, the injury of a child is more severe from a punishment standpoint than any kind of criminal charge,"" he said. The CDC says one child, on average, every three days died in accidental incidents in the United States from 2000 to 2005, the last year data are available. Bartlett said his office has filed charges in previous cases when there was culpable negligence on the part of a gun owner. But, he says, there are cases where accidents happen, not crimes. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence says that 34 percent of children in the United States live in homes with at least one firearm, so people have to be aware. ""It's a horrible thing, and those parents will blame themselves from here out, and you have to look at things real close to see if it warrants any enforcement from our end,"" Bartlett said.","Boy, 12, found .25-caliber gun in box in closet .

"INDIO, California (CNN) -- Parents danced with their young children to the infectious hip-hop beat of Lupe Fiasco on the main stage. The Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Karen O is immersed in the music at Coachella. Twentysomethings wearing feathers in their hair jumped up and down to Somali emcee K'naan in the Gobi tent. In the portable toilets, an impromptu discussion broke out about the ""awesomeness"" of Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer Karen O. The mercury may have hovered close to 100 degrees, and somewhere outside the desert oasis of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival there was a global recession, but you'd never know it from the carefree crowd on Day 3 at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. Although exact figures have yet to be released, about 50,000 revelers turned out for the final day of the 2009 festival for an eclectic lineup that included former Jam front man Paul Weller, rap pioneers Public Enemy, a reunion of Irish indie darlings My Bloody Valentine and a nearly three-hour set from The Cure. Promoters say the turnout exceeded expectations, and this year's attendance figure might be the third largest in the festival's 10-year history. The three-day ticket price may have been steep -- roughly $300, including service charges -- but when divided among the 131 acts on the bill, that breaks down to less than $2.50 per act. This was also the first year concert promoter Goldenvoice offered layaway, which is how 18 percent chose to pay. The strong showing is good news for Bonnaroo, All Points West, Lollapalooza and other festivals taking place this spring and summer. Coachella was also moved up one weekend, which allowed for more kids on spring break to attend. Although Coachella is one of several music festivals in the United States, it still carries a certain cachet that's hard to match. Perhaps it's the scenery -- listening to music on a grassy polo field surrounded by swaying palm trees and craggy desert mountains. Or maybe it's the thrill of discovering new artists and rediscovering old ones standing shoulder-to-shoulder with friends, strangers and the random Hollywood celebrity. Or maybe it's the wacky moments that seem to happen only under the blistering desert sun. Where else could you get Morrissey -- a well-known vegetarian -- complaining in the middle of his Friday set that the smell of burning animals was making him sick, and that he only hoped it was human? The Moz was referring to meat grilling in a food booth across the polo field. And when troubled British neo-soul singer Amy Winehouse dropped out of her Saturday performance because she couldn't get a visa, M.I.A. stepped into her slot on the main stage -- but she apparently wasn't happy about the upgrade. Despite a massive, adoring crowd and a highly charged set, the new mom exclaimed, ""This is the main stage? Next time, I'm back in a tent! I prefer the sweat!"" This was after her tongue-in-cheek nod to Winehouse, where she sang, ""They tried to make me do the Oscars, I said, 'No, no, no.' "" Then, there were the memorable music moments. Friday headliner Sir Paul McCartney didn't end his playful, hit-filled set until about 54 minutes past the midnight curfew -- for a potential fine of $54,000. (According to Benjamin Guitron, media relations officer for the Indio Police Department, the promoter agrees to pay $1,000 for every minute past 12 a.m.) On Saturday, Seattle, Washington, indie pop band Fleet Foxes drew an overflowing crowd to the Outdoor Theatre, charming the audience with its delicate, baroque harmonies. Sunday headliners The Cure played 31 songs from the group's vast catalog -- concentrating heavily on early material, and for the most part, staying away from the biggest radio hits. They, too, played well past curfew -- continuing with their third encore even after the sound from the main PA system was cut off. My Bloody Valentine -- whose four members reunited last year after a decade apart -- was also a crowd pleaser, although an interlude where they played a single chord at maximum decibels for a mind-numbing 15 minutes left fans scratching their heads. Perry Farrell is the only artist who's performed at all 10 Coachella festivals -- in Jane's Addiction, Porno for Pyros, Satellite Party, as his alter ego DJ Peretz and in other incarnations. This year, he dueted with Thievery Corporation on the main stage, then headed over to the dance tent, where he joined his wife, Etty, for an electronic set. ""I would probably silently be very depressed if they wouldn't invite me, to tell you the truth. My mental health depends on them,"" he said with a laugh. Despite a time of belt-tightening, festivalgoers are finding a way to let it all hang out. According to The Desert Sun, the local newspaper, even two former first daughters couldn't resist the draw of the desert. It said Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush Hager dropped into Coachella on Saturday -- complete with Secret Service. Guitron couldn't confirm the report, but he did say, ""I wouldn't be surprised if they did show up. Dignitaries just kind of show up like everybody else.""","Coachella music festival wraps up Sunday .

"(CNN) -- Antiguan and Barbudan regulators Friday took control of U.S.financier Robert Allen Stanford's financial institutions on the twin-island nation, a day after federal agents served the Texas businessman with papers accusing him of running an investment fraud scheme. Customers queue outside the Stanford Group-owned Bank of Antigua in St. John's. The Financial Services Regulatory Commission of Antigua and Barbuda appointed receivers to manage Stanford International Bank Ltd. and Stanford Trust Company Ltd., the commission said in a statement. The receivers, Nigel Hamilton-Smith and Peter Wastell of Britain-based Vantis Business Recovery Services, are in Antigua with other recovery specialists to take control of the entities, the commission said. On Thursday, the FBI announced federal agents found Stanford in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and served him with papers accusing him and three of his companies of orchestrating a $9.2 billion investment fraud scheme. He has no criminal charges against him, and he was not taken into custody, FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said. The FBI won't talk about a criminal investigation of Stanford's activities, but federal law enforcement officials familiar with the case leave no doubt that federal agents are investigating his financial dealings. But multiple officials indicated criminal charges are not imminent and would not discuss potential charges. Stanford has arranged to give his passport to one of his attorneys, who will offer it to federal authorities. CNN's efforts to reach Stanford or company representatives were unsuccessful.  Watch more on the case » . In a complaint filed Tuesday in federal court in Dallas, Texas, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Stanford International Bank of using a network of financial advisers to sell about $8 billion of ""certificates of deposit"" to investors. The bank boasted it had a unique investment strategy that had allowed it to reap double-digit returns on its investments for the previous 15 years, the SEC said. The civil complaint alleged an additional scheme relating to $1.2 billion in sales. The Antigua-based bank claims its network has $51 billion in deposits and assets under management or advisement, with more than 70,000 clients in 140 countries. The allegations against Stanford and his companies have sparked runs on Stanford banks in Antigua and in Venezuela, where the government took over the local subsidiary after it recorded ""extraordinary"" withdrawals Tuesday and Wednesday, said Edgar Hernandez Behrens, Venezuela's superintendent of banks. The SEC complaint also named James Davis, SIB's chief financial officer; Laura Pendergest-Holt, chief investment officer of Stanford Financial Group; and investment adviser Stanford Capital Management. Meanwhile, Colombia's stock market and bank watchdog said Friday Colombians who invested in the Bogota stock market through Stanford's Colombian brokerage arm, Stanford Bolsa y Banca SA, run no risk of losing their funds. A Financial Services Superintendency spokeswoman told CNN that Stanford Bolsa y Banca managed three Bogota mutual funds worth a total of about $27 million (70 billion Colombian pesos) at current stock and currency market rates, together with individual client portfolios of around $98 million (250 billion Colombian pesos). She said extraordinary shareholder meetings had been called to decide whether the three mutual funds would be transferred to the management of another brokerage or would be liquidated. Individual clients have begun the process of transferring management of their portfolios to other brokerages, the Financial Services Superintendency spokeswoman said. Colombians were never able to deposit funds directly in Colombia with Stanford's international banking arm. CNN repeatedly tried calling the manager of Stanford Bolsa y Banca, but he declined to answer calls. In London, the England and Wales Cricket Board said it has terminated all contractual links with Stanford.","Antigua and Barbuda regulators seize Stanford Group banks on islands .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The pirate suspect arrested in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama was all smiles on arriving in New York City late Monday, escorted by a phalanx of law enforcement officers. The unidentified pirate suspect arrested in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama arrived in the U.S. late Monday. None of the officers would confirm his identity, but his arrival for trial in the United States had been widely expected. The suspect arrived at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Office Building in Manhattan, which is linked to a federal detention facility where he was expected to be held pending an appearance in federal court. The timing of that appearance was not immediately available. He was walked through the rain, surrounded by media, as well as officers from federal and New York City law enforcement agencies. The suspect wore a dark jumpsuit and handcuffs, and what appeared to be a bandage on his left hand. Members of the media urged him to comment, but it was not clear whether he understood. He smiled broadly and laughed. He had been handed over to federal authorities by the U.S. military in Djibouti, defense officials said. The suspect, known in official documents as ""Pirate Defendant,"" was brought to Djibouti aboard the USNS Walter S. Diehl, a refueling ship that was with the warship USS Bainbridge at the scene of the failed hijacking on April 8 that turned into a hostage ordeal 350 miles off Somalia. Three pirates who were holding the Maersk Alabama's captain in the ship's lifeboat were killed by Navy SEALs four days later. The survivor had surrendered and was aboard the Bainbridge when the captain, Richard Phillips, was rescued, officials have said. From the Bainbridge, he was transferred to the USS Boxer for medical treatment.  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa » . The surviving pirate was wounded when crew members of the Maersk Alabama took him hostage in the early hours of the pirate attack on the cargo ship, according to the military. The crew members had hoped to exchange him for their captain, but the pirates did not release Phillips when the crew returned their captive. ""I'm mad because, you know, I could have been dead right now,"" Ken Quinn, the Maersk Alabama's navigation officer, told CNN Radio on Monday. ""But at the same time he's just a little skinny guy, you know, from Somalia where they're all starving and stuff."" Quinn said he wasn't angry at the single alleged pirate, noting that piracy in the region is fueled by the urge to survive hardship and poverty. He said the suspect told him that he wanted to go the United States, and asked whether Quinn could help him get there. ""I said, 'Yeah, you'll probably going to go anyway. I don't think you're going to need my help,'"" Quinn said. ""If he goes to jail here, it will be a whole lot better than living in Somalia.""

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- At Beijing's East Train Station, some travelers are literally carrying their lives on their back. Passengers crowd a railway platform in Beijing as New Year holiday migrations get underway. ""I don't know if I'm going to come back,"" said one migrant worker on his way to his home province. ""I might just end up working on the farm."" He was weighed down by a giant pack filled with everything he could call his own. Millions of migrant workers are leaving the cities, returning to their homes in the vast Chinese countryside, for the Chinese New Year holidays. But not all will be celebrating. Many do not have jobs to come back to. They flocked to the urban areas during boom times to earn a better living. Some have not seen their families for years -- the trip home is too expensive. But they have sent money home faithfully every month. When they finally can go home, the journey is long.  Watch passengers haul huge bags on journey home » .

Travel is already up significantly compared to last year, when brutal snowstorms stranded passengers for days.  Watch this year's snowstorms grip part of China » . This year, more people seem to be going home than usual because of the global economic crisis. There are so many passengers trying to get from one place to another that tickets are hard to come by. Planes, trains and buses are fully loaded to destinations across the country. The train is the most popular option, cheaper than a plane and faster than a bus. But tickets are selling out fast. Some people have waited in line for hours, even days to get a ticket. ""I started standing in line three days ago,"" said one man. ""There's no way to buy the ticket."" Others stood at the entrance to Beijing's East Station with signs. ""Need two tickets to Weihan"" or ""Want to go to Inner Mongolia."" Some blame the ticket shortage on scalpers who are hoarding tickets, then re-selling them for a profit. One man said he wanted 100 yuan or $15 more per fare and indicated he had tickets to multiple destinations. The Chinese government has cracked down on scalpers, arresting more than 4,000. But many Chinese think scalpers are more of a solution, than a problem. One woman told us she bought a ticket from a scalper because there was no other way. All the tickets to her hometown were sold out days in advance. The desperate hunt for tickets is a sign this could be China's most massive mass migration ever. And with the Chinese economy slowing down so much, so fast, this may be the last time some people are making the trip.","Downturn could make this year's Chinese new year migration biggest ever .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Somali suspect in the hijacking of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama has been charged with piracy, a count that carries a minimum life sentence. Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse arrives in the United States on Monday. He was charged with piracy Tuesday. Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse also has been charged with conspiracy to seize a ship by force, conspiracy to commit hostage-taking and two firearm charges, according to a criminal complaint released by the U.S. attorney's office in the southern district of New York. Muse ""conducted himself as the leader"" of the pirates who allegedly took over the Maersk Alabama, according to the criminal complaint. A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Muse could be tried as an adult. U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew Peck had ordered the media and public out of the courtroom earlier while he evaluated Muse's age. Muse's father in Somalia told defense attorneys the young man was born on November 20, 1993 -- making him 15, the defense attorneys said. However, the prosecution argued otherwise, saying Muse made statements that suggest he is older. Before Peck closed the courtroom, Muse wiped his hand over his face at one point, and it appeared he was crying. He had worn a broad smile late Monday when he arrived in New York escorted by a phalanx of law enforcement officers.  See timeline of events that led to piracy case » . Muse was arrested in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship that pirates attacked on April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast.  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa » . Peck read the young man his rights and said attorneys had been appointed to represent him because the suspect did not have the resources to hire representation himself. Muse said through an interpreter that he understood and said, ""I don't have any money."" Pirates attacked the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship, on April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast. According to the criminal complaint, two of the 20 crew members -- all Americans -- saw lights heading toward the Maersk Alabama around 4:30 a.m. on April 8, while the ship was in the Indian Ocean. After a ""brief time,"" the lights disappeared, the complaint said, but about two hours later, the same crew members saw a small boat approaching and later heard ""what sounded like"" gunshots, the complaint said. Crew Member 1 then heard the ship's captain -- later identified as Capt. Richard Phillips -- on the radio saying that two pirates were on the ship's bridge. A third crew member, Crew Member 3, also heard the radio message and began shutting down the ship's power, the complaint said. The complaint said Muse, who was carrying a gun, was the first alleged pirate on the ship, and said the attackers used a portable ladder to climb on board. According to the complaint, Muse had fired his gun at Phillips, the captain said, and then took $30,000 from the ship's safe after he forced Phillips to open it.  Watch Muse being hauled into court » . Muse demanded that the Maersk Alabama be stopped and that the crew give him the number of the ship's owner, the complaint said. The captain then ordered the crew to the bridge after Muse ordered him to do so, the complaint said, citing Crew Member 2. Muse then began canvassing the dark ship with Crew Member 2 as a guide, the complaint said. While they were going through the ship, Crew Member 3, who had not come to the bridge, tackled Muse to the ground, the complaint said. Crew Member 2 helped subdue Muse, and the two tied the young man's hands with wire and took him to the ship's safe room, where several crew members were hiding. After several hours, the remaining pirates said they would leave the ship if Muse was returned to them, and if a lifeboat was given to them. Phillips boarded the lifeboat with them and the ship's crew freed Muse, who then boarded the lifeboat, according to the criminal complaint. The boat floated a short distance from the Maersk, even as the Navy's USS Bainbridge arrived the next day. Over the next three days, officers on the Bainbridge communicated with the pirates by radio. ""In those communications, the pirates threatened to kill the captain if they were not provided with safe passage away from the scene,"" the complaint said. At one point, Phillips tried to escape and the pirates shot at him, the complaint said. On April 12, Muse boarded the USS Bainbridge and demanded safe passage for himself and the other pirates in exchange for Phillips' release. Muse also received medical treatment while he was on the warship, the complaint said. While Muse was away from the lifeboat, Navy SEALs shot and killed the three remaining pirates. The U.S. Navy recovered two loaded AK-47 assault rifles; two gunstraps, each containing three AK-47 magazines; one handgun magazine; and multiple cell phones and handheld radios from the lifeboat, according to the complaint.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The pirate suspect arrested in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama was all smiles on arriving in New York City late Monday, escorted by a phalanx of law enforcement officers. The unidentified pirate suspect arrested in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama arrived in the U.S. late Monday. None of the officers would confirm his identity, but his arrival for trial in the United States had been widely expected. The suspect arrived at the Jacob K. Javits Federal Office Building in Manhattan, which is linked to a federal detention facility where he was expected to be held pending an appearance in federal court. The timing of that appearance was not immediately available. He was walked through the rain, surrounded by media, as well as officers from federal and New York City law enforcement agencies. The suspect wore a dark jumpsuit and handcuffs, and what appeared to be a bandage on his left hand. Members of the media urged him to comment, but it was not clear whether he understood. He smiled broadly and laughed. He had been handed over to federal authorities by the U.S. military in Djibouti, defense officials said. The suspect, known in official documents as ""Pirate Defendant,"" was brought to Djibouti aboard the USNS Walter S. Diehl, a refueling ship that was with the warship USS Bainbridge at the scene of the failed hijacking on April 8 that turned into a hostage ordeal 350 miles off Somalia. Three pirates who were holding the Maersk Alabama's captain in the ship's lifeboat were killed by Navy SEALs four days later. The survivor had surrendered and was aboard the Bainbridge when the captain, Richard Phillips, was rescued, officials have said. From the Bainbridge, he was transferred to the USS Boxer for medical treatment.  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa » . The surviving pirate was wounded when crew members of the Maersk Alabama took him hostage in the early hours of the pirate attack on the cargo ship, according to the military. The crew members had hoped to exchange him for their captain, but the pirates did not release Phillips when the crew returned their captive. ""I'm mad because, you know, I could have been dead right now,"" Ken Quinn, the Maersk Alabama's navigation officer, told CNN Radio on Monday. ""But at the same time he's just a little skinny guy, you know, from Somalia where they're all starving and stuff."" Quinn said he wasn't angry at the single alleged pirate, noting that piracy in the region is fueled by the urge to survive hardship and poverty. He said the suspect told him that he wanted to go the United States, and asked whether Quinn could help him get there. ""I said, 'Yeah, you'll probably going to go anyway. I don't think you're going to need my help,'"" Quinn said. ""If he goes to jail here, it will be a whole lot better than living in Somalia.""

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India's child-rights watchdog has sought a report from police investigating allegations by a tabloid that the father of a ""Slumdog Millionaire"" child star tried to sell her to an undercover reporter, the watchdog's leader told CNN. Rubina Ali has backed her father over newspaper allegations he offered her to an undercover reporter. ""We have sought a report from them and will take a decision after seeing it,"" said Shantha Sinha, who heads the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. Meanwhile, authorities in Mumbai have recorded the statements of Rafiq Qureshi; his ""Slumdog"" daughter, Rubina Ali; and his former wife, Khurshida Begum, senior police inspector Prakash Salunke told CNN. Qureshi has denied allegations made in Britain's News of the World that he tried to sell 9-year-old Rubina for £200,000 ($290,000), Salunke said. In her statement, the child-actor favored her father, according to the police. Qureshi's former wife, whom he divorced several years ago, endorsed the allegations leveled against him by the British newspaper. Police are investigating, Salunke said. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" won eight Oscars this year, including best picture. Director Danny Boyle's rags-to-riches movie tells the story of a tea-boy at a Mumbai call center who earns a spot in the Indian version of the quiz show ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?"" He raises the suspicion of the show's host when, despite the lack of a formal education, he begins to answer the increasingly difficult questions with ease. The movie is set largely among the poverty-stricken districts of Mumbai, which is home to Rubina and other ""Slumdog"" child stars in real life.","Indian child-rights watchdog requests police report on alleged offer to sell child star .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran said Saturday that Morocco's decision to cut diplomatic ties between the two countries harms Muslim unity, state media reported. Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki says soldiarity in Islamic world needed to support Palestinians. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that at the present juncture when the unity and solidarity of Islamic countries is necessary for supporting the Palestinian people, this act of Morocco harms unity of the Muslim world,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a written statement, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported. Morocco decided to cut diplomatic ties with Iran Friday, blaming Tehran's ""inadmissible attitude"" against the African country as a reason for the decision for the move, Moroccan Press Agency said. The move ratchets up a feud between Sunni Morocco and Shiite Iran. On February 25, Morocco recalled its interim charge d'affaires from Tehran for a week of consultations, the statement said. Morocco has demanded that Iran explain ""unacceptable"" language in a statement it issued after Morocco expressed its solidarity with Bahrain, the statement said. Bahrain, a tiny Persian Gulf archipelago, embodies the Sunni-Shiite divide. With a majority Shiite population and a Sunni ruler, Bahrain has become a point of contention between Morocco and Iran, said Sandra Mackey, a Middle East analyst and author of ""The Iranians."" Mackey said Bahrain's government has not allowed its Shiite majority into the political and economic power structure, ""so Iran has an interest in egging on this Shia foment in Bahrain -- in order to raise Iran's stature in the Persian Gulf."" Morocco has ambitions to raise its stature among Arab states, and ""it would make some sense that they would jump on this,"" she said. ""They're far enough away where it's not going to impact on them directly,"" Mackey added. Mackey said other emirates would likely be more cautious about confronting Iran, she said, ""but the Moroccans can do it without posing any serious threat on their doorstep."" There is potential for conflict within Bahrain, she said. ""The Shia are really pushing against this Sunni government and the Sunni government, I think, is in a fairly significant amount of trouble,"" she said.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- The United Nations Sunday launched a special tribunal to prosecute the assassins of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. A statue of slain former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq Hariri stands in Beirut. The tribunal convened at The Hague more than four years after Hariri was killed in a massive car bombing in Beirut on February 14, 2005. The bomb, detonated as Hariri's armored motorcade passed through Beirut's fashionable seaside Corniche district, contained hundreds of pounds of explosives. It left buildings shattered and streets littered with the mangled wreckage of vehicles. The blast also killed 22 other people. The Lebanese army was out in force on the streets of Beirut Sunday as people turned out to pay their respects to Hariri, who is buried downtown in the Lebanese capital. The U.N. tribunal will have 11 judges, whose identities are being kept secret for their safety. Four will be Lebanese. The prosecution could take as long as 10 years, sources close to the tribunal said. Four senior Lebanese generals are being held over the bombing, which also killed 22 other people. But many Lebanese -- as well as the United States and U.N. investigators -- believe Syria ordered the assassination. Syria denies it. The tribunal's prosecutor, Daniel Bellemare, refused to commit when asked at a news conference Sunday if Syrians would be charged. He said the public would have to wait and see. The U.S. State Department pledged its continued support of Lebanese judicial authorities and the tribunal's operations. The United States has promised to contribute $14 million; a request for an additional $6 million is pending approval from Congress. In a statement issued Sunday, acting State Department spokesman Robert A. Wood said Hariri's death ""was an unsuccessful attempt to undermine Lebanon's sovereignty."" He added: ""The Lebanese people answered his assassination with the Cedar Revolution, leading to the withdrawal of Syrian troops and the most democratic Lebanese elections in decades."" At the time of Hariri's death, neighboring Syria had immense political influence in the country, and had maintained troops in its smaller neighbor since the 1980s, after the fighting between Israel and the PLO in Lebanon. Hariri was admired for spearheading the rebuilding of Beirut after the country's civil war, from 1975 to 1990, and many Lebanese blamed Syria for the killing, citing Hariri's patriotism and strong sense of Lebanese independence. The killing sparked widespread protests that led to the eventual withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the election of an anti-Syrian bloc in parliament. The anti-Syrian movement is known as the March 14 Alliance, named after the day millions of supporters of Hariri took to the streets, and its actions have been dubbed the Cedar Revolution, for the nation's iconic cedar trees. Huge counter-protests also were staged by Lebanese supporters of Syria. Along the way, U.N. investigators tasked to probe the attack found links between Syria's government and Hariri's assassination. The Lebanese hope the tribunal will settle the case, but there are also fears it could further divide the nation and open up older wounds in the country. The special tribunal takes over from the Beirut-based International Independent Investigation Commission, which looked into 20 other attacks and found elements linking some of them to a criminal network behind the Hariri killing, the United Nations said. The trial will take place in a converted gymnasium in a suburb of The Hague. The U.N. says the case is expected to be ready for trial by 2010. --CNN's Cal Perry contributed to this report.","U.N. tribunal for killing of former Lebanon prime minister to convenes .

"(CNN)  -- The sagging economy is taking a bite out of federal school-meal subsidies as more students take advantage of free or low-price breakfasts and lunches, nutritionists say in a report released Thursday. About 425,000 more students are participating in the National School Lunch Program, a group reports. The School Nutrition Association surveyed more than 130 school nutrition directors from 38 states to produce its report, ""Saved by the Lunch Bell: As Economy Sinks, School Nutrition Program Participation Rises."" The nonprofit organization said that about 425,000 more students are participating in the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program in 2008-09 than in the previous school year. That represents an average increase of 2.5 percent from 2007-08, the report says. These numbers hold true despite a slight decline in the number of students enrolled in public schools this school year, according to the study. More than three-quarters of the districts surveyed reported a rise in the number of students eating free meals under the U.S. Department of Agriculture program, the report says. Many of the school district employees who monitor the food programs complain that the federal subsidies fall far short of the rising costs. According to the association, the estimated average cost to prepare a school meal is $2.90, but the federal reimbursement is $2.57. School lunch programs are experiencing a potential loss of at least $4.5 million per school day, based on 30 million school lunches provided, the group says. The good news, according to association President Katie Wilson, is that ""this year, when hunger is more common, more students are able to eat a balanced, nutritious meal at school."" Meals served under the USDA programs must meet nutrition guidelines based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. For lunches, that means no more than 30 percent of calories can come from fat and fewer than 10 percent from saturated fat.","Number of students eating subsidized meals rises 2.5 percent, nonprofit says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Rep. Julia Carson, a former secretary who rose to become Indianapolis' first African-American congresswoman, has announced she has terminal lung cancer, a newspaper reports. Health problems have troubled Rep. Julia Carson, D-Indiana, for years. The 69-year-old former City-County Council member and state senator told the Indianapolis Star on Saturday that she had been on a leave of absence since September to seek treatment and rehabilitation for a leg infection. ""Then the second shoe fell -- heavily,"" Carson told the paper in a brief written statement. ""My doctor discovered lung cancer. It had gone into remission years before, but it was back with a terminal vengeance."" Representing the Hoosier State's 7th District since 1997, Carson opposed the Iraq war resolution in 2002 and worked to honor historic civil rights figure Rosa Parks. Fellow Democrats praised her as a bright personality who successfully fought against abuse of the welfare system. Rozelle Boyd, a longtime Democratic member of Indianapolis' City-County Council told the Star he was surprised by Carson's announcement. ""She was able to walk with giants without losing the common touch,"" he told the paper. ""That is what I think was so very important to her and to the people of the district."" Before entering the House, Carson served six years as a trustee for the city's Center Township, creating a $6-million surplus from the office's $20-million debt, the Star reported. Her mentor, former Democratic Indiana Rep. Andy Jacobs, has said Carson ""not only took cheats off the welfare rolls, she sued them to get the money,"" according to the Star. Early in her career, Carson worked as a secretary and then aide to Jacobs. After her work on the City-County Council, she won her first of two terms to the Indiana House, according to Congressional Quarterly. Later she won election to the state Senate, where she served until 1991. When Jacobs retired after serving 15 terms in the U.S. House, he endorsed Carson as his successor, and helped her win a difficult election in 1996 against GOP attempts to capture her seat, Congressional Quarterly reported. Carson was the first woman and first African-American Indianapolis had ever sent to Congress, according to her Web site. Among her other achievements, Carson led Congress to pass a House measure awarding Parks the Congressional Gold Medal, Carson's Web site said. The Star named her Woman of the Year in 1991 and 1974. ""Julia to me is one of the most beautiful people with a great personality,"" said State Sen. Glenn Howard, an Indianapolis Democrat. ""She cares about everyone, regardless of race or color."" Carson has been beset by health problems. In January 1997, she took her House oath of office at Indianapolis' Methodist Hospital as she recovered from double-bypass surgery, according to the Star. She also has suffered from high blood pressure, asthma and diabetes, according to Congressional Quarterly. In 2004, Carson missed almost a third of House roll call votes, Congressional Quarterly reported, prompting tough questions about her health during that year's re-election campaign. Voters returned her to Congress by an 11 percent margin. She's the sponsor of the House National Defense Rail Act, legislation before Congress which would provide more than $40 billion to develop high-speed rail connections and short-distance corridors between larger cities, her Web site said.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal's Andrey Arshavin became the first player to score four goals in a league game at Liverpool for 64 years but it was not enough to stop the Reds returning to the top of the Premier League after another 4-4 draw. Russian Arshavin hit four goals for the first time in his career in a dramatic eight-goal Anfield thriller. A week after crashing out of the Champions League 7-5 on aggregate after sharing eight goals in their quarterfinal second leg at Chelsea, Liverpool took their fans on another rollercoaster ride. A draw was going to be enough to take the Merseysiders above Manchester United -- they have two games in hand -- but it needed 90 minutes of drama before they edged ahead on goal difference. Russian striker Arshavin opened the scoring after 36 minutes and struck again after 67, 70 and 90 as Arsenal bounced back following their weekend FA Cup semifinal defeat. Fernando Torres, with a header after 49 minutes, and Yossi Benayoun (56) hit back after halftime before Arshavin sent Arsenal 3-2 ahead with 20 minutes left. Torres's second of the night after 72 hauled Rafael Benitez's side level two minutes later -- but it took Benayoun to salvage a draw for Liverpool in the third minute of time added on after that man Arshavin had hit number four after 90 minutes. It was the first time in his career that Arshavin had scored four in a match and he told Sky: ""I liked the game but of course it's not good for the team...almost basketball."" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said of his Russian star: ""His performance was outstanding. He had a quiet first half but when he comes into the game he is always very dangerous. He has personality and is a winner."" Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez saw his team concede a quartet of sloppy goals but he could not fault their commitment to the cause. ""You never know,"" he said of the Reds' dwindling hopes of overhauling United. ""Today we made too many mistakes, but it's also very positive because the team showed character until the last minute."" Benitez added: ""They (United) had it (the advantage in the title race) before and they continue in the driving seat. We have to keep pushing and showed today we will fight until the last game.""","Andrey Arshavin hits four goals as Arsenal draw 4-4 at Liverpool who go top .

"INDIO, California (CNN) -- Parents danced with their young children to the infectious hip-hop beat of Lupe Fiasco on the main stage. The Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Karen O is immersed in the music at Coachella. Twentysomethings wearing feathers in their hair jumped up and down to Somali emcee K'naan in the Gobi tent. In the portable toilets, an impromptu discussion broke out about the ""awesomeness"" of Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer Karen O. The mercury may have hovered close to 100 degrees, and somewhere outside the desert oasis of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival there was a global recession, but you'd never know it from the carefree crowd on Day 3 at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. Although exact figures have yet to be released, about 50,000 revelers turned out for the final day of the 2009 festival for an eclectic lineup that included former Jam front man Paul Weller, rap pioneers Public Enemy, a reunion of Irish indie darlings My Bloody Valentine and a nearly three-hour set from The Cure. Promoters say the turnout exceeded expectations, and this year's attendance figure might be the third largest in the festival's 10-year history. The three-day ticket price may have been steep -- roughly $300, including service charges -- but when divided among the 131 acts on the bill, that breaks down to less than $2.50 per act. This was also the first year concert promoter Goldenvoice offered layaway, which is how 18 percent chose to pay. The strong showing is good news for Bonnaroo, All Points West, Lollapalooza and other festivals taking place this spring and summer. Coachella was also moved up one weekend, which allowed for more kids on spring break to attend. Although Coachella is one of several music festivals in the United States, it still carries a certain cachet that's hard to match. Perhaps it's the scenery -- listening to music on a grassy polo field surrounded by swaying palm trees and craggy desert mountains. Or maybe it's the thrill of discovering new artists and rediscovering old ones standing shoulder-to-shoulder with friends, strangers and the random Hollywood celebrity. Or maybe it's the wacky moments that seem to happen only under the blistering desert sun. Where else could you get Morrissey -- a well-known vegetarian -- complaining in the middle of his Friday set that the smell of burning animals was making him sick, and that he only hoped it was human? The Moz was referring to meat grilling in a food booth across the polo field. And when troubled British neo-soul singer Amy Winehouse dropped out of her Saturday performance because she couldn't get a visa, M.I.A. stepped into her slot on the main stage -- but she apparently wasn't happy about the upgrade. Despite a massive, adoring crowd and a highly charged set, the new mom exclaimed, ""This is the main stage? Next time, I'm back in a tent! I prefer the sweat!"" This was after her tongue-in-cheek nod to Winehouse, where she sang, ""They tried to make me do the Oscars, I said, 'No, no, no.' "" Then, there were the memorable music moments. Friday headliner Sir Paul McCartney didn't end his playful, hit-filled set until about 54 minutes past the midnight curfew -- for a potential fine of $54,000. (According to Benjamin Guitron, media relations officer for the Indio Police Department, the promoter agrees to pay $1,000 for every minute past 12 a.m.) On Saturday, Seattle, Washington, indie pop band Fleet Foxes drew an overflowing crowd to the Outdoor Theatre, charming the audience with its delicate, baroque harmonies. Sunday headliners The Cure played 31 songs from the group's vast catalog -- concentrating heavily on early material, and for the most part, staying away from the biggest radio hits. They, too, played well past curfew -- continuing with their third encore even after the sound from the main PA system was cut off. My Bloody Valentine -- whose four members reunited last year after a decade apart -- was also a crowd pleaser, although an interlude where they played a single chord at maximum decibels for a mind-numbing 15 minutes left fans scratching their heads. Perry Farrell is the only artist who's performed at all 10 Coachella festivals -- in Jane's Addiction, Porno for Pyros, Satellite Party, as his alter ego DJ Peretz and in other incarnations. This year, he dueted with Thievery Corporation on the main stage, then headed over to the dance tent, where he joined his wife, Etty, for an electronic set. ""I would probably silently be very depressed if they wouldn't invite me, to tell you the truth. My mental health depends on them,"" he said with a laugh. Despite a time of belt-tightening, festivalgoers are finding a way to let it all hang out. According to The Desert Sun, the local newspaper, even two former first daughters couldn't resist the draw of the desert. It said Barbara Bush and Jenna Bush Hager dropped into Coachella on Saturday -- complete with Secret Service. Guitron couldn't confirm the report, but he did say, ""I wouldn't be surprised if they did show up. Dignitaries just kind of show up like everybody else.""","Coachella music festival wraps up Sunday .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Police think it started with a dispute over an ex-girlfriend. Threats were made on social networking sites and via text messages. The suspects, clockwise from top left are: Lernio Colin, Angel Cruz, Peter MacDonald and Christopher Harter. A murder plot was hatched and, police say, in the early hours of last Saturday morning, a Florida man was gunned down in his car. But the suspects apparently killed  the wrong man. Now four men are in custody, and will face charges of first degree premeditated murder and two counts of attempted murder. The four are Angel Cruz, 23; his brother from Oregon, Christopher Harter, 29; Peter MacDonald, 18; and Lernio Colin, 20. They have all appeared before a judge in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. They have not entered pleas and are being held without bond, according to state prosecutors. Detectives are executing search warrants today, and much about the case is still not known. ""The victim was with two other males, in the vehicle,"" said Mike Jachles of the Broward Sheriff's Office. ""One of those men was the intended target,"" Jachles told CNN. Witnesses said multiple shots were fired, according to police. Henry Mancilla, 24 was sitting in the driver's seat of a gold Mitsubishi Galant at an intersection in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale. ""They were exiting the vehicle when shots were fired, striking Mancilla,"" said Jachles. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Mancilla was with two other men in their early 20s, Tony Santana and Nick Pappas. One of them was the intended victim, but police are not saying who. ""The four men acted in unison in planning and executing this murder. Mancilla was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and he ended up the victim,"" said Mike Jachles. The three victims said they had been ""jumped"" earlier in the evening by the same four men and fled the scene in a red Chevy Impala, according to a sheriff's detective affidavit released Monday afternoon. Later, a blue Chevy Silverado pickup truck belonging to the defendant Cruz drove up to the three men, according to the affidavit. The victims say they armed themselves with a baseball bat and a walking cane, when the truck turned around and drove towards them. That's when the shots were fired. Christopher Harter told police he was in the vehicle at the scene, but said he left the vehicle and then heard four or five gunshots, according to the affidavit. Harter also told police he saw his brother, Angel Cruz, in possession of a semi-automatic pistol three weeks prior to the incident. ""It could have been a case of mistaken identity, but our investigation will determine that,"" Jachles told CNN. Threats were posted on social networking sites and sent via cellular text messages by the suspects to the intended victim, said police. Police said they have not subpoenaed those records and are not releasing the names of those Internet sites. The Broward County State Attorney's office could seek the death penalty.","Henry Mancilla, 24, shot to death as he sat in his car with two others .

"ATHENS, Greece (CNN) -- Protesters clashed with riot police and 10,000 people marched on parliament in Greece as a 15-year-old boy killed by police was buried Tuesday.

Thousands paid their respects to Alexandros Grigoropoulos at his funeral, but a small number of the protesters there grew violent at the end of the ceremony. Riot police lined up as night fell and a reasonably peaceful candlelight vigil was held in central Athens. Some 10,000 people marched on the country's parliament Tuesday to express their anger at the teenager's death, and also other issues like the economy, jobs, and allegations that the government is corrupt. Groups clashed with riot police at the parliament and across central Athens. Street riots started over the weekend after Athens police killed 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos on Saturday. Police said six young protesters pelted a police patrol car with stones, and the teen was shot as he tried to throw a fuel-filled bomb at the officers. The shooting occurred in a neighborhood where there have been regular clashes with police, but it immediately sparked clashes and riots in Athens and Thessaloniki, the country's second-largest city. The violence then spread to other municipalities.  Watch iReporter John Kountouris' videos of the violence » . The events have exacerbated the unpopularity of the ruling party and left Greek Prime Minister Konstandinos Karamanlis scrambling to shore up support.  Watch crowds gathered for funeral » . On Tuesday, he met with President Karolos Papoulias and cabinet members before briefing political leaders on the country's security situation. Opposition leader George Papandreou of the left-wing PASOK party said: ""The country does not have a government that can protect its citizens, their rights, or their safety. ""I told Mr. Karamanlis that our society, our citizens are experiencing a multiple crisis: an economic crisis, a social crisis, an institutional crisis, and a crisis of values. And the government is unable to address these crises; they have lost the confidence of the Greek people.""  See images of anarchy on Greek streets » . Karamanlis ruled out early elections and called for all political parties to stand together against violence. ""It's our responsibility to maintain a united stance against illegal acts,"" he said in statement. ""We must condemn in the strongest terms, with pure reason and not minced words - the violence, pillaging, and vandalism, that hampers social peace."" The government called on union leaders to cancel a national strike planned for Wednesday, fearing it could lead to further violence. But the labor movement refused, saying the action was planned before the shooting of the boy and was unrelated to it. Cleaning crews worked for hours early Tuesday to clear the mess left by the riots, but evidence of the violence remained. In some places, entire rows of shops still have broken windows. iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video of rioting . The mayor of Athens asked residents not to dispose of garbage for a day because many of the city's trash bins were destroyed in the violence. Karamanlis vowed again Tuesday that those responsible for the violence would be punished. ""I assured the president that no leniency will be tolerated in holding people accountable,"" he told reporters. ""No one has the right to use this tragic incident as an alibi for actions of raw violence."" Athens police said 12 policemen were injured in Monday's violence and 87 people were arrested. There were 10 flashpoints across Athens where police confronted rioters, police said.  Watch protesters clash with police » . Many of the young people who rioted holed up at universities, taking advantage of a decades-old rule that bars police from entering university grounds. The rule came into force after tanks crushed a 1973 student uprising protesting the ruling military junta. The dean of Athens University resigned Tuesday as a result of the students' violent behavior. Public and private schools and universities across the country were shut again Tuesday. Watch as iReporter witnesses the clashes . Demonstrators torched government buildings and the offices of the ruling conservative party in central Athens. They also set cars and trash containers ablaze. Monday, young demonstrators barricaded streets in Athens and Thessaloniki and hurled gasoline bombs as they battled police. Clouds of tear gas hung over the capital as police tried to disperse the crowds. The police officer who fired the fatal shot at the teenage boy has been charged with ""manslaughter with intent"" and suspended from duty, police said, adding that a second police officer was arrested Saturday on criminal accessory charges. Government officials, including the interior minister, have condemned the shooting. Authorities conducted an autopsy on the boy Monday in an effort to clarify the circumstances of the shooting, but the boy's family has called in their own investigators to verify state findings, the Athens coroner told CNN.

"(CNN) -- Mac computers are known for their near-immunity to malicious computer programs that plague PCs. Some security experts say viruses are moving toward Mac as those computers become more popular. But that may be changing somewhat, according to computer security researchers. It seems that as sleek Mac computers become more popular, they're also more sought-after targets for the authors of harmful programs. ""The bad guys generally go toward the biggest target, what will get them the biggest bang for their buck,"" said Kevin Haley, a director of security response at Symantec. Until recently, the big target always was Microsoft Windows, and Apple computers were protected by ""relative obscurity,"" he said. But blogs are buzzing this week about what two Symantec researchers have called the first harmful computer program to strike specifically at Mac. This Trojan horse program, dubbed the ""iBotnet,"" has infected only a few thousand Mac machines, but it represents a step in the evolution of malicious computer software, Haley said. The iBotnet is a sign that harmful programs are moving toward Mac, said Paul Henry, a forensics and security analyst at Lumension Security in Arizona. ""We all knew it was going to happen,"" he said. ""It was just a matter of time, and, personally, I think we're going to see a lot more of it."" The malicious software was first reported in January. It didn't gain widespread attention until recently, when Mario Ballano Barcena and Alfredo Pesoli of Symantec, maker of the popular Norton antivirus products, detailed the software in a publication called ""Virus Bulletin."" Mac users at large, however, should not be alarmed by the incident, experts said. The program infects only computers whose users downloaded pirated versions of the Mac software iWork. The harmful software is a Trojan horse, meaning it tries to sneak into the computer with some sort of permission from the user. Computer worms travel differently. They wiggle their way into computers and replicate without the owner's approval or knowledge. The Mac program is called a botnet because infected computers become part of a network that is controlled by the program's author. The Mac botnet is significantly less threatening than computer worms like the much-publicized Conficker.c, said Jose Nazario, a senior security researcher with Arbor Networks. Conficker was thought to have infected up to 10 million computers, compared with thousands for the iBotnet, researchers said. There's also some question as to whether it is the first botnet to target Mac. Others have targeted both PCs and Apple computers. ""This isn't the first botnet that's been built using Mac computers,"" Nazario said. ""This is an interesting one in that it's a little more flexible and includes some new features. ... It's getting a lot of press mostly because it's Mac and people are talking about how Macs are immune to malware -- and, sure enough, they're not."" The potential damage that could be caused by the Mac botnet is also less severe than other attacks, said Darrell Etherington, a contributor to theAppleBlog, which is not affiliated with the computer company. ""It's a very low-level attack,"" he said. ""Some people won't even notice the effect of it."" It is in the interest of software companies like Symantec, who spread the news, and McAfee, which has downplayed the presence of the Trojan, to raise concerns so they can promote their antivirus software packages, he said. ""Yes, it is going to become a bigger problem and, yes, people have to become more aware, but I think that what McAfee and Symantec would like is for the panic to start and for people to start rushing to antivirus software,"" which isn't necessary yet, Etherington said. In a statement, Apple said it is working to prevent security problems. ""Apple takes security very seriously and has a great track record of addressing potential vulnerabilities before they can affect users,"" the statement says. Only about 7.4 percent of computer users work on Macs, according to Gartner, a technology research firm. That user base is proportionally more affluent than PC users, Etherington said, which may make Mac a bigger target. But overall, Macs are still far less vulnerable to attack than PCs, he said. Haley said news of the Apple botnet is significant in part because it's something other authors of malicious code can build from. ""I don't think it's a tipping point; I think it's an evolutionary step. We see virus authors often use what somebody else has done,"" he said. ""There's a model. There's something out there to follow.""","Researchers find computer malware aimed at Mac computers .

"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, CNN's Jaime FlorCruz writes about press freedoms covering the Olympics. Journalists surf the Internet at the main Olympics press center in Beijing. BEIJING, China (CNN) -- For many overseas reporters now in Beijing, covering the Summer Games has turned into an Olympian task. We go through tedious security checkpoints to cover events and conduct interviews even as we deal with bureaucratic and linguistic barriers. But we face one particularly irritating issue: China's limits on Internet access. Despite Beijing's earlier promise to allow open reporting and unfettered access to information, Internet access remains erratic and unpredictable. ""It's so counter-intuitive to find the Internet restricted, even if only selectively,"" one western journalist told me in Beijing. Last week, colleagues working in the Media Press Center faced a blank computer screen whenever they clicked on sites deemed sensitive to the Chinese authorities -- like Amnesty International and Falun Gong. That is attributed to China's sophisticated filter system, also known as the ""Great Firewall."" Why the paranoia? Pro-democracy activists, as well as advocates for Tibet independence and the spiritual group Falun Gong, have Web sites carrying information and views that the Chinese authorities deem ""subversive."" These sites reinforce Beijing's worst fears about cyberspace. China has groomed ""Internet police"" to patrol its networks and is constantly upgrading software to filter sites. Under Chinese law, using the Internet to ""harm national interests,"" ""spread rumors"" or ""leak state secrets"" is punishable by stiff prison terms. Journalists and politicians alike cried ""foul"" but other critics turned their criticism on the International Olympic Committee (IOC.) When Beijing submitted its Olympic bid seven years ago, the Chinese promised: ""There will be no restrictions on journalists in reporting on the Olympic Games."" The U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China, which monitors human rights and rule of law issues in China, has compiled documents that show that International Olympic Committee agreements with the Chinese government, from the start, were based on abiding by China's domestic laws. Those laws, the commission says, give authorities a lot of ""wiggle room"" to define actions that might ""endanger state security"" or ""disrupt social order."" Chinese regulations, for example, include a ""service guide"" for the foreign media. That guide notes the regulations apply to ""the coverage of the Beijing Olympic Games and the preparation as well as political, economic, social and cultural matters of China by foreign journalists, in conformity with Chinese laws and regulations."" China's ""Provisions on the Technical Measures for the Protection of the Security of the Internet,"" which went into effect in 2006, note the regulations are aimed at ""promoting the sound and orderly development of the Internet and safeguarding the state security, social order and public interests.""  Learn more how China monitors the Internet » . Last week, foreign journalists discovered Internet access to Web sites such as Amnesty International or sites with Tibet in the address were still restricted. After a media uproar, China seems to have relented. Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said: ""If there are some needs to adjust on the Chinese side, we will do that.""  Amnesty International's site, for example, has been accessible since August 1. However, the site of Falun Gong remains taboo. Andrew Lih, a new media expert based in Beijing, says that ""unblocked sites are still subject to the sophisticated keyword blocking system of the GFW (the Great Firewall of China.)"" China has also tightened its grip on other media sources. The English version of Time Out, the monthly listings and entertainment guide, has been told to close. Freelance journalists are finding it hard to renew Chinese visas and accreditation for smaller, niche publications have become virtually impossible. Even a writer from Saveur, a food magazine, was denied a visa. Last Tuesday, relations between journalists and Chinese authorities soured again after police in the frontier region of Xinjiang roughed up and detained two Japanese reporters who were sent to cover a suspected terrorist attack. They suffered minor injuries and their equipment damaged during the scuffle. ""This is utterly unacceptable any time,"" says Jonathan Watts, president of the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China. ""It's particularly reprehensible just days before the Olympics at a time when China has promised complete media freedom."" The incident has prompted a rare apology from the local police, who also offered to pay for the damage and medical bills.","Internet access remains erratic for journalists in Beijing covering the Olympics .

"ASUNCION, Paraguay (CNN)  -- A second woman stepped forward Monday to say that Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo fathered a child out of wedlock when he was a Roman Catholic bishop. Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo says Monday he will comply with justice on the latest paternity allegation. Benigna Leguizamon said Lugo fathered her son in 2002 in the city of San Pedro. She served notice that Lugo has 24 hours to acknowledge paternity or she will take legal action. ""I am waiting in good will,"" she said in an interview on CNN affiliate Telefuturo TV. ""But if they don't do something, oh, my God."" Lugo, 57, acknowledged last week that he is the father of a 2-year-old child conceived in the months before he stepped down as bishop. He said last week he was making the admission ""with the most absolute honesty, transparency and feeling of obligation."" Without acknowledging paternity, he expressed similar sentiments Monday about the latest allegation. ""We're going to act always in pursuit of the truth ... in this private matter,"" he said in a nationally televised announcement on Telefuturo. Last week's announcement came after a woman filed suit in a southern Paraguay city seeking a paternity test. ""It's true that there was a relationship with Viviana Carrillo,"" Lugo told reporters, naming the mother. ""I assume all the responsibilities that could derive from such an act, recognizing the paternity of the child."" Leguizamon, 27, said Monday that last week's announcement had encouraged her to come forth. ""When I saw the case with Viviana, I was strengthened to make my accusation,"" Leguizamon said. She said she made the accusation to help her 6-year-old son, who is starting school. She will ask for a DNA test, she said. In last week's case, Judge Evelyn Peralta said she was treating it routinely. ""It is a case like any other, which involves the president and nothing more,"" she said. ""It will be processed at it should be."" Some Cabinet members interpreted Lugo's acknowledgment of paternity as an indication of the change he has promised to bring about to achieve greater transparency in the public sector. ""This is the Paraguay that we want,"" said Liz Torres, minister of children's issues. ""This is the Paraguay of serious change in which there is no double standard or secrets. It seems to be an example, a very big lesson."" But some opposition party members said it appeared that Lugo practically had been forced to acknowledge what happened and that he had not done so willingly. Sen. Julio Cesar Velasquez of the opposition Colorado Party called on the Vatican to excommunicate Lugo. Lugo was made a lay Catholic last year, around the time he assumed the presidency.","Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo fathered son, woman says .

"MARANA, Arizona (CNN) -- I've been privileged in the past to witness Tiger Woods out on a golf course. And I can tell you, it's a painful, frustrating process. Golf fans flocked to Arizona to see Tiger make his long-awaited return to the tee. Not because the golf he produces isn't spectacular and at times utterly dazzling but it's the sheer volume of people he attracts that help convince me each and every time golf has to be one of the worst ""out on the course"" spectator sports going. That's just my opinion though. Try telling that to the legions who got themselves to Arizona this week once they heard the world's top player was making his return to the game after more than eight months. Woods' first competitive slice of action in the best part of a year wasn't due to get under way until around lunchtime here though judging by the fans already out on the course you'd have thought his tee-time was more like 7am. Even those jostling for position to catch a glimpse of him on the range or putting green were taking no chances and ensuring they arrived in plenty of time. Remember all of this was before he even teed off! The scene on that first hole was as expected bustling to say the least. The small gantries were packed anyway due to the whole array of talent on show through this week, but it got even more frenzied when the Woods-Jones match- up was announced. Mayhem to say the least! Those seated in the stands were the lucky ones, it was the unfortunate spectators trying to stand and strain every sinew to catch a glance of that first shot from the world number one I felt for. Even us media suffered! With seconds to go before the American struck his drive, one television camera crew, which really should have known better, blatantly blocked us from getting that prized shot. Only quick last-gasp thinking from our cameraman John saved the day. In case you were wondering that Woods drive was just majestic and he would go on to win the first two holes in fine style. When he strode off down the first fairway, there was a stampede with those looking to brave the soaring temperatures here in Arizona and follow him every step of the way. The Woods 'wow factor' is still very much alive and kicking. The question is will the so-called bionic knee hold up in the weeks and months to come?","Fans jostle for a view of their hero on Tiger's return to competitive golf .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Somali suspect in the hijacking of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama has been charged with piracy, a count that carries a minimum life sentence. Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse arrives in the United States on Monday. He was charged with piracy Tuesday. Abduwali Abdukhadir Muse also has been charged with conspiracy to seize a ship by force, conspiracy to commit hostage-taking and two firearm charges, according to a criminal complaint released by the U.S. attorney's office in the southern district of New York. Muse ""conducted himself as the leader"" of the pirates who allegedly took over the Maersk Alabama, according to the criminal complaint. A federal judge ruled Tuesday that Muse could be tried as an adult. U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew Peck had ordered the media and public out of the courtroom earlier while he evaluated Muse's age. Muse's father in Somalia told defense attorneys the young man was born on November 20, 1993 -- making him 15, the defense attorneys said. However, the prosecution argued otherwise, saying Muse made statements that suggest he is older. Before Peck closed the courtroom, Muse wiped his hand over his face at one point, and it appeared he was crying. He had worn a broad smile late Monday when he arrived in New York escorted by a phalanx of law enforcement officers.  See timeline of events that led to piracy case » . Muse was arrested in the hijacking of the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship that pirates attacked on April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast.  See an interactive map of 2009 pirate attacks off the Horn of Africa » . Peck read the young man his rights and said attorneys had been appointed to represent him because the suspect did not have the resources to hire representation himself. Muse said through an interpreter that he understood and said, ""I don't have any money."" Pirates attacked the Maersk Alabama, a cargo ship, on April 8 about 350 miles off the Somali coast. According to the criminal complaint, two of the 20 crew members -- all Americans -- saw lights heading toward the Maersk Alabama around 4:30 a.m. on April 8, while the ship was in the Indian Ocean. After a ""brief time,"" the lights disappeared, the complaint said, but about two hours later, the same crew members saw a small boat approaching and later heard ""what sounded like"" gunshots, the complaint said. Crew Member 1 then heard the ship's captain -- later identified as Capt. Richard Phillips -- on the radio saying that two pirates were on the ship's bridge. A third crew member, Crew Member 3, also heard the radio message and began shutting down the ship's power, the complaint said. The complaint said Muse, who was carrying a gun, was the first alleged pirate on the ship, and said the attackers used a portable ladder to climb on board. According to the complaint, Muse had fired his gun at Phillips, the captain said, and then took $30,000 from the ship's safe after he forced Phillips to open it.  Watch Muse being hauled into court » . Muse demanded that the Maersk Alabama be stopped and that the crew give him the number of the ship's owner, the complaint said. The captain then ordered the crew to the bridge after Muse ordered him to do so, the complaint said, citing Crew Member 2. Muse then began canvassing the dark ship with Crew Member 2 as a guide, the complaint said. While they were going through the ship, Crew Member 3, who had not come to the bridge, tackled Muse to the ground, the complaint said. Crew Member 2 helped subdue Muse, and the two tied the young man's hands with wire and took him to the ship's safe room, where several crew members were hiding. After several hours, the remaining pirates said they would leave the ship if Muse was returned to them, and if a lifeboat was given to them. Phillips boarded the lifeboat with them and the ship's crew freed Muse, who then boarded the lifeboat, according to the criminal complaint. The boat floated a short distance from the Maersk, even as the Navy's USS Bainbridge arrived the next day. Over the next three days, officers on the Bainbridge communicated with the pirates by radio. ""In those communications, the pirates threatened to kill the captain if they were not provided with safe passage away from the scene,"" the complaint said. At one point, Phillips tried to escape and the pirates shot at him, the complaint said. On April 12, Muse boarded the USS Bainbridge and demanded safe passage for himself and the other pirates in exchange for Phillips' release. Muse also received medical treatment while he was on the warship, the complaint said. While Muse was away from the lifeboat, Navy SEALs shot and killed the three remaining pirates. The U.S. Navy recovered two loaded AK-47 assault rifles; two gunstraps, each containing three AK-47 magazines; one handgun magazine; and multiple cell phones and handheld radios from the lifeboat, according to the complaint.

"(CNN) -- It's Sunday night during TNT's coverage of the NBA playoffs, and announcer Kenny Smith, aka ""The Jet,"" is doing push-ups. TNT's Kenny Smith tries to connect personally with NBA fans through his Twitter feed. Not on camera, but on Twitter. ""Hawks look hot! CWebb, my boy Fabian and I doing 30- pushups P90X style every commercial.. getting summeer [sic] ready,"" writes Smith to his followers on Twitter, the microblogging site where you can ""tweet"" brief messages of up to 140 characters. Five hours later, Smith (@TheJetOnTNT) tweets a follow-up: ""Man, i think im gonna be sore."" By Monday morning, though, he seems raring to go again: ""Im not sore today! the workout didnt kill me... Im back!!"" Welcome to today's intersection of sports and social networking, where college athletes, professional players and even broadcasters use tools like Facebook and Twitter to share their thoughts and experiences with fans. ""Sports personalities are tweeting now. They are giving fans a reason to tune in to see their comments,"" says Adam Ostrow, managing editor of Mashable, a blog devoted to online social media. Ostrow believes social networking sites like Twitter allow athletes to connect directly with fans without the filter of the traditional media. And while many athletes and teams have blogs and Facebook profiles, Twitter allows for a more personal connection between fan and sports, he says. NBA All-Star Shaquille O'Neal (@THE_REAL_SHAQ) is both a prolific scorer and a prolific twitterer. His more than 700,000 followers get his tweets about everything from his diet to his recent trip to Graceland. Seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong (@lancearmstrong) has more than 650,000 Twitter followers for such updates as ""Eating pizza at home w/ the family. Good test today, kids go home tomorrow (sad), and a hellacious week of training coming up."" Hockey players also are getting into the act. Washington Capitals ace Alex Ovechkin (@ovi8) was on Twitter during the NHL All-Star game in January, tweeting about the festivities and responding to fan questions and comments. One athlete, Milwaukee Bucks forward Charlie Villanueva (@CV31), even got into hot water after tweeting during halftime of a game last month. Villanueva's entry read: ""In da locker room, snuck to post my twitt. We're playing the Celtics, tie ball game at da half. Coach wants more toughness. I gotta step up."" He did. Villanueva finished with a team-high 19 points, and the Bucks won. Now sports announcers are using Twitter to talk to fans about everything from game action to what they do when the cameras are off. Fox Sports (@MLBonFox) baseball commentators and reporters are using Twitter to share tidbits from players and behind-the-scenes moments that the normal fan may not even think about. Fox play-by-play announcer Joe Buck, one of the network's wittier twitterers, shared this recent tender moment from the broadcast booth: ""Joe Buck: Cold in the booth in STL. Tim [McCarver] and I are bundled up. And snuggling. Hard to type. I think hypothermia is starting to set in!"" TNT is using the same approach to connect with basketball fans during the current NBA playoffs. Eleven members of the network's broadcast team have joined Twitter to provide insight into games, offer nuggets from players and solicit fan opinions. ""TNT is an interesting experiment if they add analysis they don't give on TV,"" said Ostrow of Mashable. ""More interesting if they give more non-basketball info."" And they are. When Kenny Smith started on Twitter, he wasn't really sure what it was or how it would work. So he just answered the default question on his page: What are you doing? ""I want to have some fun with it,"" Smith told CNN. ""I love scavenger hunts. I might leave tickets to the conference finals somewhere and leave clues on my Twitter."" Twitter gives announcers another way to connect with sports fans, Smith said. ""You can give an attitude [on Twitter],"" he said. ""They can hear you on the air, but [on Twitter, they] get to hear your voice."" Smith hopes to continue revealing ""behind-the-scenes"" details in his tweets, because he wants his more than 1,000 followers to feel like they are there. And he plans to continue twittering beyond the NBA playoffs. Increasingly, sports fans use social networking to talk back. For the Stanley Cup playoffs, the NHL recently organized ""tweetups"" where Twitter users met face-to-face to talk about whatever brought them together. Events were organized in 21 cities in the United States and Canada. Laura Astorian, a self-described hockey blogger who follows the St. Louis Blues and Atlanta Thrashers, helped organize an NHL tweetup in Atlanta, Georgia. She said even though the city's hockey-fan base is relatively small, the fans rely on each other and use social networking sites like Twitter to communicate. ""The people who did come enjoyed the chance to sit down and talk hockey with like-minded people,"" Astorian said. ""We did have fun, and there was mention of using the tweetup strategy for our draft party in July.""","More pro athletes are using Twitter to share their thoughts and experiences with fans .

"(CNN) -- Debbie Phelps, the mother of swimming star Michael Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals in Beijing, is the author of a new memoir, ""A Mother For All Seasons."" Debbie Phelps, mother of Olympian Michael Phelps, tells Larry King her son has strong values. Phelps spoke with CNN's Larry King about her new book, a recent tabloid report detailing her son's partying ways and the infamous bong photo. The following is an edited version of the transcript. Larry King: You have this terrific new book coming. If I do say so myself, it's inspiring. Yet (Thursday's) lead story in the ""New York Daily News"" gate crasher column -- I don't know who writes that -- ""tsk, tsk,"" it says, ""Michael Phelps, partying your face off in public is not the way to reclaim your good guy image. The Olympian was been laying relatively low since his bong smoking scandal in January was out in full force Tuesday night at New York City hot spot Marquis"" -- I think is the name -- ""Michael was definitely having a good time, an eyewitness tells us, drinking straight from a bottle of Grey Goose. When the DJ started playing MIA's 'Paper Planes,' he got up started dancing like a loon and kept on yelling 'shots.' Phelps definitely had enough alcohol on hand for several four round. He ordered four bottles of Vodka."" Is this tough for a mother? How do you react? Debbie Phelps: It's one thing that I learn at a very early age is I don't get caught up in gossip columns. I know my son. He has great values, lots of integrity. That's what I think about that. King: Did you talk to him about this? Phelps: I always talk to Michael. I talk to Michael every day. We talked about training today and things of that nature. King: But it would be normal to say, what happened, wouldn't it? I would say that to my son. Phelps: We give support. We give guidance. We give an ear to listen. And, again, I don't get caught up in gossip. King: Therefore, you don't believe it? I just want to establish what your feelings are. Phelps: I don't get caught up in gossip, Mr. King. King: What about something that wasn't gossip, the picture with the bong thing. It was a picture. Phelps: It's a picture, that's true. But, you know, a picture can say many things. It has many words. It has many meanings. It has many visualizations that you want to think. It depends on the person who is looking at that picture. You know, as a mom, I support all three of my children. I believe that no matter who you are in this country, in this world, there are obstacles that get into your life. I call them speed bumps in school sometimes. I heard someone say lightning bolts. That's another term for that. But, you know, how do we grow? How do we learn? You raise a child through 18. You send them off to college. You give them the roots. You give them the foundation to be a strong, young man, a strong lady. Life throws curve balls to you sometimes. How do you handle that curve ball? King: Michael is 23. That's an adult. He's an adult. Phelps: A young adult. King: Young adult. So one could say it's his life. He chooses to lead it. As our parent, we do our best to guide them, but 23 is 23. Do you view him still as a kid? Phelps: I view my 31-year-old daughter as a kid sometimes. You know, I look at each of my children independently and individually of themselves. They have many strong values, strong points, professionalism. I'm just very proud of all three of them and everything they've done. King: Do you think these kind of stories -- and you don't pay attention to them -- hurt your book? Phelps: I was asked many times and told many times, ""Debbie, you need to write a book some day."" As an educator, I'm thinking, I would really like to do that. It became a personal goal of mine to be able to publish a book, not knowing exactly what it was going to be. Was it going to be my life? Was it going to be parenting? Was it going to be swimming? Was it just going to be motivational and inspirational?

It's a great bonding relationship. Families are very important. King: Is he still a role model, do you think? Phelps: You know, when I think of the word role model, I'll go back to me being a little girl. It was my mom and my dad. They were my role models when I was growing up. When I hear that role model in a sentence with my son, what I think about with Michael is what he does with and for children. It might be things people don't even know of -- his association with the Boys and Girls Club. For years, he has done that (and) his association with Make A Wish. He touches kids' lives. So if an individual, wherever they may be, may select my son as a role model, I say that my son has strong values. I say he's a human being. And I say that from obstacles that get in people's ways -- we all have them, Mr. King, and you know that -- what do you learn from them and how do you rise above the occasion?","Debbie Phelps says she doesn't get caught up in gossip involving son, Michael .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Justice John Paul Stevens is approaching his 40th year on the federal bench -- the last 34 on the Supreme Court, deciding thousands of cases. But he said his love of the law was nurtured decades earlier by a professor's dedication and the enduring power of a political dispute that blossomed into a landmark decision known as Marbury v. Madison. Justice John Paul Stevens swears in Vice President Joe Biden. Stevens has been on the court for 34 years. ""It was the beginning, well, of my whole legal career,"" Stevens told CNN in a recent exclusive interview. ""You read it today and you will find some current value in it. For me, that case inspired a lasting appreciation and respect for the rule of law."" The 88-year-old justice, who sources said has no plans to step down anytime soon, is not alone in citing the 1803 high court ruling as a cornerstone of federal court authority. The landmark decision for the first time established the power of the Supreme Court to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional. It also helped codify the idea of separation of powers as a lasting hallmark of the American system of government. The case is the subject of a new book, ""The Great Decision: Jefferson, Adams, Marshall and the Battle for the Supreme Court"" (PublicAffairs Books), which includes Stevens' analysis of the opinion's impact over the years. Written by Clifford Sloan -- a former Stevens law clerk -- and David McKean, it offers an inside look at how the federal judiciary, led by Chief Justice John Marshall, muscled itself into equal footing with the other two branches of government. It is a struggle, Sloan noted, that continues to affect issues today, such as the president's authority in the war on terror, federal bans on late-term abortion and church-state disputes. ""There is a view of an enduring role for our courts that rises above the political pressures and cross-currents of the moment,"" said Sloan. ""There are imperfections, there are problems, but it's been the most protective regime for rights and liberties of any country in the world. And it's really attributable to the special role of the [Supreme] Court in safeguarding our rights and liberties that Marbury established."" Immersed from the start in Marbury v. Madison . Stevens still has his law school notes from Northwestern University, which he entered in 1945. It was just months after leaving the Navy, where he served as an intelligence officer during World War II. At the time, he was thinking of becoming an English teacher, but Stevens said his brother Richard asked him to think about a law career. ""At the time I was trying to decide what to do, and it seemed like a sensible move,"" Stevens said, with his characteristic Midwestern modesty. It was as a freshman that he met his early mentor, Nathaniel Nathanson, who immersed his students in Marbury v. Madison from the start. ""I knew nothing about it before I went to law school, but it was a major part of our constitutional law course,"" Stevens recalled. ""We began with the case and we were still on it six or eight weeks later. We spent most of the first semester studying that one case, and the different issues that come out of it."" Something must have stuck, because when he graduated two years later, Stevens had the highest GPA in the history of the law school. The justice gives credit for much of his budding success to Nathanson, a former Northwestern dean and faculty member for 47 years. ""He was very brilliant, he could ask good questions and get people to think about issues,"" said Stevens. ""He was a very decent and inspiring teacher."" From political pot-boiler to legal treatise . One thing Stevens admires about Marbury v. Madison is ""there are a whole bunch of issues that are discussed in it. When is executive privilege something that the president can rely on; when should there be a remedy for a wrong?"" It was a big case that had humble beginnings. The behind-the-scenes intrigue reads more like a political pot-boiler than a legal treatise. The fight began in early 1801, in the closing days of the Federalist administration of President John Adams -- who had just lost the election to Thomas Jefferson, who was poised to take over the White House. Sloan noted, ""Adams was packing the federal government, the District of Columbia government, and the federal courts with midnight appointees. One of these was William Marbury."" The Maryland financier was set to be justice of the peace of Washington, but somehow his commission was not delivered in time, in person by the State Department, as the law required. So when Jefferson -- a Democratic-Republican -- took over, he canceled all pending appointments, leaving Marbury and other Federalists in the outs, and enraged. Marbury sued the Jeffersonians to get his job back. The ""Madison"" in this case was none other than James Madison -- principal author of the U.S. Constitution, and then Jefferson's secretary of state. Marshall played two roles . As a backdrop, ""The Great Decision"" details fascinating tales of the capital at the turn of the 19th century, including ""the dust and grime of Washington"" -- not much different from our own, except perhaps for the grime. Among the tales: A senator's ""romantic interest"" -- as Stevens put it -- in Dolley Madison, wife of the future president; and Marshall's own physical prowess -- he reportedly could jump 6 feet and had a taste for fine whiskey. It was that man's failure as a bureaucrat and genius as a judge that led to the 4-0 decision. In February 1801, native Virginian Marshall -- an Adams ally -- was serving as both secretary of state and the newly named chief justice of the United States. ""He was the one who bungled the delivery of the commissions,"" said Sloan, ""so he was deeply involved in the underlying facts of the case. The genius of Marshall was that he got out of a very difficult jam by finding Marbury's appeal to have merit, but his direct appeal to the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional."" Such direct appeals were allowed under federal law, but the high court ruled the law went too far by attempting to give one branch of government a power specifically denied it by the Constitution. The decision thus set precedents for both separation of powers and constitutional interpretation -- the court's right to declare a law unconstitutional. In Marshall's famous words, ""It is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department"" -- the courts, he means -- ""to say what the law is."" It put the case on sacred constitutional ground in the eyes of many subsequent justices. It was cited in Brown v. Board of Education, and the 1974 order for President Nixon to turn over secret White House tapes during the Watergate scandal. Stevens emphasizes separation of power . Sloan said his old boss in particular has a fondness for the stirring words of Marbury. ""It's not surprising that when justices like Justice Stevens are grappling with the very difficult questions that come before them and the deeply contested constitutional issues that they turn to that guiding star of the first principle of Marbury v. Madison, and get inspiration and strength from it."" It was separation of powers Stevens chose to emphasize as a principal hallmark of Marbury. During a panel discussion a few weeks ago, he noted the wall between the courts and the executive can be breached. As an example, he cited public swear-ins of justices that have lately been held at the White House. Stevens said it is far preferable they be conducted at the Supreme Court itself -- such as his 1975 ceremony -- to underscore the ""very separate status"" of the justices. He later said the power he and his fellow benchmates enjoy today is embedded in that principle: . ""Marbury v. Madison established that idea of separation, something no other branch of government -- no political majority -- can take away from the judiciary.""","Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens says case inspired his career .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A group of student protesters were arrested Sunday after they called on President Bush to end the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, Sudan, and refused to leave the front gates of the White House. The protesters shouted, ""Hey Bush, you can't hide! Help us end this genocide!"" and ""President Bush! No more excuses!"" Federal police arrested 18 of them after they marched to the White House. Sunday's protest was one of many scheduled around the world for ""Global Day for Darfur"" to mark five years of ethnic cleansing in Sudan.

"ST. GEORGE, Utah (CNN) -- A young man whose arranged marriage to a young cousin led to the conviction of polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs was charged Wednesday with her rape. Prosecutors filed the rape charge against Allen Steed, 26, a day after a jury found Jeffs guilty of two rape-accomplice counts in connection with Steed's ill-fated 2001 marriage to Elissa Wall. Jurors found that Jeffs used his authority as leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or FLDS, to push the girl into a marriage she did not want. Steed was 19 and his bride, who also was his first cousin, was 14 when Jeffs ""sealed"" them in spiritual marriage at a motel in Caliente, Nevada, where many FLDS weddings were performed. Three other couples also were married that day in separate ceremonies, according to testimony. Steed is accused of having sex with the girl against her will several weeks into the marriage. Steed testified for the defense at Jeffs' trial. He said his new wife was affectionate to him in private, but cold in public. He denied that he or Jeffs had forced sex on her. Wall agreed to be identified publicly as the trial ended in hopes of encouraging other women who feel trapped by polygamy to come forward.  Watch Wall urge other girls to be brave » . She testified that she told Steed she was not ready and that her first sexual encounter made her feel dirty, used and trapped. Her pleas to church leaders to end the marriage were ignored, and Jeffs told her to submit ""mind, body and soul"" to her new husband, Wall told the jury. Her sisters testified that most of the women in the family also opposed the marriage but were powerless to stop it. According to the criminal complaint, the trial established that the pair had sex and that the young woman had convinced jurors she did not consent. Wall left the marriage and the FLDS in 2004. She is now remarried. An attorney for Steed could not be reached. Jeffs, 51, leads the 10,000-member FLDS, which is based in the twin border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona.

"(CNN) -- Sri Lankan cricketers have described for the first time how they feared some of their teammates had been killed during a deadly attack on the team bus by gunmen in Pakistan -- and paid tribute to the driver of the bus for saving their lives. Thilan Samaraweera is due to undergo surgery to have a bullet removed from his leg. Six police officers and a driver were killed in the ambush by around a dozen attackers armed with automatic weapons as the players made their way to Lahore's cricket stadium early Tuesday. Two players, Tharanga Paranavitana and Thilan Samaraweera, suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and leg respectively while six others suffered shrapnel wounds. But vice-captain Kumar Sangakkara told CNN he believed Paranavitana had been killed when he collapsed after being shot. ""I was lying on the ground. I heard Thilan (Samaraweera) groan and I heard Tharanga Paranavitana say something. I turned around and a bullet whizzed past my head and hit the seat in front of me. And then I got hit in the shoulder by shrapnel,"" Sangakkara said. ""Then I saw Tharanga Paranavitana get up and say 'I've been shot' and then he collapsed on the seat. I really thought he was seriously hurt or even dead."" Read profiles of the wounded players » . Describing the initial moments of the ambush, Sri Lanka coach Trevor Bayliss said there had been an explosion ""which someone said later was a rocket launcher that missed the bus and went over the top and hit somewhere in front of us.""  Watch footage of the gunmen staging their attack » . He said two cars then pulled up in front of the convoy, blocking its path. Gunmen jumped out of the cars and started firing, sending bullets ripping through the bus. ""By that stage everyone was on the ground,"" Baylis told CNN. ""Surprisingly it was very calm. There was not a lot we could do except keep low as possible and hope for the best. Every now and then someone would just yell out and say 'I'm hit.'""  Watch Bayliss talk about his experience » . Sangakkara said someone at the front of the bus had shouted to the players to take cover. ""Some of the guys looked up to see what was going on because the bus just swerved a bit and almost came to a stop,"" he said. ""Suddenly we heard a couple of explosions getting closer. And then someone from the front of the bus shouted 'They're shooting at the bus -- get down!' That's when we just hit the deck and suddenly we heard bullets thudding into the bus. It kept going for about a minute.""  Watch Sangakkara describe how players ducked for cover » . A Pakistani security official on the bus then shouted to the driver in Urdu to ""go, go go!"" Sangakkara said. ""I think we owe our lives to him -- he just put the bus in gear and drove straight through the carnage straight to the ground,"" he said. ""They tried to shoot the bus driver first and missed and the guy had the presence of mind to do what was needed to save all our lives."" Baylis also praised the driver of the bus for his bravery. ""He jumped back in his seat with all the bullets coming through the bus and he got us into the stadium. It wasn't until we got into the stadium that we could see how hurt some of the players were,"" Baylis said. Once inside the stadium the players received medical attention. ""Everyone still seemed confused and shocked but the mood was quite upbeat,"" said Sangakkara. ""A few jokes were being cracked, people were talking to each other, making sure everyone was ok, everyone made a great effort to keep the mood lighter than it could have been in that situation and that's helped a lot of the guys to get through it."" Sangakkara said he'd had some of the shrapnel removed from his shoulder inside the stadium. He also underwent surgery to remove some more after arriving home in Colombo earlier Wednesday. Paranavitana and Samaraweera are also expected to undergo surgery. Samaraweera still had a bullet in his leg, Sangakkara said. Meanwhile match referee Chris Broad criticized Pakistan's security forces for their conduct during the attack, claiming they had abandoned match officials traveling in the convoys as ""sitting ducks."" The Englishman and other officials had been traveling in a minibus behind the Sri Lankan team bus when bullets ripped through the vehicle, killing the driver and critically wounding fourth umpire Ahsan Reza. Broad has been hailed as a hero for reportedly shielded Reza but he played down his bravery. ""I'm not a hero. Ahsan Raza took a bullet to the stomach or chest -- somewhere in the spleen and lung region. I was lying behind him on the floor of the van and there were bullets flying all around us,"" Broad said. ""I only noticed he was injured when I saw a large pool of blood had spilled on to the floor and out of the partially opened van door."" Broad said police vans detailed to protect the vehicles in the convoy had apparently disappeared during the attack. ""I am extremely angry that we were promised high-level security and in our hour of need that security vanished and they left us to be sitting ducks.

"(CNN) -- A total of seven cases of a previously undetected strain of swine flu have been confirmed in humans in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. None of the patients has had direct contact with pigs. Swine flu is usually diagnosed only in pigs or people in regular contact with them. Five of the cases have been found in California, and two have been found in Texas, near San Antonio, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the CDC's Interim Deputy Director for Science and Public Health Program. The CDC reported Tuesday that two children in the San Diego, California, area, infected with a virus called swine influenza A H1N1, whose combination of genes has not been seen in flu viruses in either human or pigs before. The patients range from age 9 to 54, Schuchat said. They include two 16-year-old boys who attend the same Texas school, and a father and daughter in California. ""The good news is that all seven of these patients have recovered,"" Schuchat said. The first two cases were picked up through a special influenza monitoring program, with stations in San Diego and El Paso, Texas. The program aims to get a better sense of what strains exist and to detect new strains before they become widespread, the CDC said. Other cases emerged through routine and expanded surveillance. At this point, the ability for the human influenza vaccine to protect against this new swine flu strain is unknown, and studies are ongoing, she said. There is no danger from contracting the virus from eating pork products, Schuchat said. The new virus has genes from North American swine and avian influenza, human influenza and swine influenza normally found in Asia and Europe, said Nancy Cox, chief of the CDC's Influenza Division. Swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza, according to the CDC. It does not normally inflect humans, but cases have occurred among people, especially those who have had direct exposure to pigs. There have also been cases in the past of one person spreading swine flu to other people, the CDC said. In 1988, in an apparent swine flu infection in pigs in Wisconsin, there was antibody evidence of virus transmission from the patient to health care workers who had contact with the patient, the CDC said. Person-to-person transmission is believed to occur in a manner similar to the spread of the influenza virus: through infected people coughing and sneezing, the CDC said. People may contract swine flu by touching something with viruses on it and then touching their mouth or nose. From December 2005 to February 2009, 12 cases of human infection with swine flu were documented. Symptoms of swine flu in humans are expected to resemble regular human seasonal influenza symptoms, including fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, and coughing, the CDC said. Other reported symptoms include runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The new strain of swine flu has been resistant to the antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine, but has responded to the other licensed options: oseltamivir and zanamivir. The CDC is working closely with health officials in California and Texas to learn more about the virus. The agency expects to find more cases, Schuchat said. If swine flu can mutate to spread between humans, what does this mean for avian flu? Because of the virus subtype, it is less likely that avian flu would become transmissible from person to person, but still possible, said Dr. William Short at the division of infectious diseases at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The news is not cause for widespread panic, but people at risk -- those who live in or have traveled to the areas where patients live, or have been in contact with pigs -- should watch out for symptoms and get tested if they occur, Short said. The three criteria for a pandemic are a new virus to which everybody is susceptible, the ability to spread from person to person readily, and wide geographic spread, said Dr. Jay Steinberg, infectious disease specialist at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia. The new strain of swine flu only meets one of these criteria: its novelty. On the other hand, bird flu meets two of the criteria: novelty and geographic spread.  If history is any indication, flu pandemics tend to occur once every 20 years or so, meaning we're actually due for one, he said. However, it is not likely to be the swine flu, he said. ""I can say with 100 percent confidence that a pandemic of a new flu strain will spread in humans,"" Steinberg said. ""What I can't say is when it will occur.""","CDC: Five cases found in California, two found in Texas .

"(CNN) -- Piracy off the coast of Somalia has more than doubled this year, threatening to make international trade more expensive and offering terrorists a new source of income, says a report released Wednesday. A photo from the destroyer USS Howard shows Somali pirates in small boats hijacking the MV Faina last week. As of late September, 60 ships had been attacked in 2008, said the report by Chatham House, a London-based institute that analyzes international issues. The report comes amid a standoff between officials and pirates demanding a $20 million ransom for the release of a Ukrainian ship captured off the coast of Somalia last week. Money from the $18 million to $30 million in ransoms paid this year is helping finance the war in Somalia, the report says. One of the groups reportedly receiving ransom money is Al-Shabaab, which the United States listed as a terrorist organization this year. Asked to rank the problem on a scale of one to 10, report author Roger Middleton said it's middle range but could quickly deteriorate. ""At the moment, it's a five-six problem with the potential to be seven or eight,"" Middleton said. ""You're looking at a nine, 10 if it starts to be co-opted by international terror organizations."" About 16,000 ships a year navigate the Gulf of Aden, which, as the southern gateway to the Suez Canal, is one of the most important trade routes in the world. The ships mostly transport oil from the Middle East and goods from Asia to Europe and North America. Having to change routes would add weeks of travel time and increase fuel consumption, driving up the cost of shipping. Insurance premiums for the Gulf of Aden have already increased tenfold, says the report, ""Piracy in Somalia: Threatening global trade, feeding local wars."" Additionally, pirates are hampering relief efforts in Somalia. ""As a result of piracy,"" the report says, ""the World Food Programme has been forced to temporarily suspend food deliveries to drought-stricken Somalia. Canada is now escorting WFP deliveries but there are no plans in place to replace their escort when it ends later this year."" Somalia's ambassador to Russia made the same point Wednesday. ""This has been a great problem for the Somalian government,"" Ambassador Mohamed Handule said. ""This hinders humanitarian aid a lot. The Somalian people are not getting it."" Middleton noted that French officials are talking about offering a U.N. Security Council resolution to increase international presence in the area. ""This new move by the European Union to put more ships into the Gulf of Aden could be quite positive,"" he said. ""Some form of U.N.-sponsored coast guard might start to chip away at this. ... If America, Europe and Russia cooperate, it can be made much safer."" He noted that France, Denmark, Netherlands and Canada offered escorts for World Food Programme ships that had been unable to enter Somali ports this year. ""A more general approach has focused on Combined Task Force 150 (CTF 150), a coalition naval task force covering the Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea, Red Sea and the Indian Ocean,"" the report states. ""CTF 150's primary responsibility is to assist in the 'war on terror,' so piracy is lower on its list of priorities. However, some of the roughly 15 ships making up CTF150 have been involved in deterring pirate attacks."" In addition, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1816 on June 2, giving foreign warships the right to enter Somali waters ""for the purposes of repressing acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea"" by ""all necessary means."" But none of these measures has stemmed the problem. ""Piracy has been a problem in Somali waters for at least 10 years. However, the number of attempted and successful attacks has risen over the last three years,"" Middleton's report says. ""With little functioning government, long, isolated, sandy beaches and a population that is both desperate and used to war, Somalia is a perfect environment for piracy to thrive."" Handule stressed that the problem has gotten worse since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami killed 225,000 people in more than 10 nations, including Somalia. The problem is compounded, he said, because Somalia does not have a coast guard. ""Pirates are mostly young unemployed men, many of them fishermen who lost their boats, tackle and their jobs following the tsunami,"" Handule said. ""They started hunting on boats, and this process went our of control. They operate in groups of up to 12-15 people, however they all have associates ashore seeking information, negotiating about ransom, etc."" Handule said officials estimate that there 25 groups with no central command. ""We believe their total number stands at about 1,000 people, counting those who help them on the ground,"" he said. Middleton's report also notes that Somalia's fishing industry has collapsed in the past 15 years, particularly as European, Asian and African ships increase their fishing in the area. Middleton offers five possible solutions to the piracy plague, including organizing shipping into a safe lane, providing a coast guard for Somalia, having a large international naval presence and refusing to pay ransoms. But he noted that none of these solutions can be easily implemented. ""It's not going to stop until Somalia has a stable government,"" he said. The CIA World Factbook notes that Somalia, a country about the size of Texas, does not have a permanent national government. ""Although an interim government was created in 2004, other regional and local governing bodies continue to exist and control various regions of the country, including the self-declared Republic of Somaliland in northwestern Somalia and the semi-autonomous State of Puntland in northeastern Somalia,"" the Factbook says.","Sixty ships had been attacked by pirates in 2008, according to institute report .

An unabashed celebration of girlishness, the coming-of-age movie tells the story of Esther, a   bespectacled and awkward teen. Looked down on as nerd at her posh private school, Esther (played by newcomer Danielle Catanzariti) reinvents herself after befriending Sunni, an older girl who goes to the local public school. Bearing a passing resemblance to the runaway U.S. indie hit ""Juno"", ""Esther Blueburger"" could well go on to imitate some of the worldwide success of its hipper American cousin. If the film is to do well, its kitschness can surely only work to its advantage. After all, many of the Australian comedies that have found success with an international audience have relied on more than just a smattering of camp. Oddly, from a country that brought the world ""Mad Max"" and Russell Crowe, many of the biggest comic hits fly in the face of the conventional stereotypes of Australian culture as straight-talking and macho. For every ""Crocodile Dundee"", in other words, there is a ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"", riding triumphantly over the horizon ready to unsettle the manhood and steal the laughs into the bargain. It was Paul Hogan's comic creation Mick ""Crocodile"" Dundee, the laidback survivalist from the outback that first put Australian comic films on the map over 20 years ago. The first ""Crocodile Dundee"" film was released in 1986 to huge commercial success worldwide -- it was the highest grossing film internationally that year -- spawned two sequels and was credited with boosting the Australian tourist industry. A lot of the laughs in the film come from the depiction of Mick Dundee (played by Hogan) as an unreconstructed, Aussie bloke struggling to come to terms with modern metropolitan life when he leaves small town Australia to visit New York. In one scene, for example, Dundee's reaction to meeting a cross-dresser on the streets of the Big Apple is to grab the man's crotch to verify his gender. Crocodile Dundee's comic book version of Australian identity may have worked well in the movie theaters, but it was viewed by many critics as hackneyed and out of touch with the reality of modern Australia. The arrival of the writer and director Baz Luhrmann in the early '90s seemed to breath fresh life into Australian film. The stunning critical and financial success of his debut feature, ""Strictly Ballroom"" in 1992 heralded a string of breakout hits that weren't afraid to show their feminine side. The story of a young ballroom dancer who flouts convention and risks the ire of the judges by dancing his own moves, ""Strictly Ballroom"" provoked a bidding war at the Cannes Film Festival after it won the Prix de Jeunesse award. Alongside a realistic portrayal of Australian small town life, there is a warm-hearted send up of the peculiar world of ballroom dancing. From the sequined costumes to the Cyndi Lauper soundtrack, the movie is also saturated in campness and kitsch. The benchmark set by Luhrmann, whose 2001 stellar musical feature ""Moulin Rouge!"" was also defiantly camp, was matched by ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" in 1994 and by ""Muriel's Wedding"" to a lesser extent the same year. ""Priscilla"" in particular created a huge stir when it was first released. Starring the venerable British actor Terence Stamp, Guy Pearce and Hugo Weaving, it is the story of three drag queens driving across the outback from Sydney to Alice Springs in a large bus they have named Priscilla. It has gone on to be regarded as a camp classic -- though perhaps not in South Korea, where it was reportedly banned for fear it might encourage homosexuality. Less overtly camp than ""Priscilla"", ""Muriel's Wedding"" celebrates the lighter side of femininity. The story of a socially awkward 'ugly duckling' whose daydreams of a glamorous white wedding are soundtracked by Abba music, the film was a surprise hit globally and launched the Hollywood career of Toni Collette -- who has a role in ""Esther Blueburger"". Muriel (played by Collette) tramps around in leopard skin inviting bitchy comments from her crass friends until she eventually plucks up the courage to head to the city. Like ""Strictly Ballroom"", it exposes the mean-spiritedness that can blight small town life -- in this case the small town in question is the kitschy fictional coastal setting of Porpoise Spit. As well as their camp credentials, one thing these films share in common is a reluctance to slip into stereotyped depictions of Australians. Questions of national identity are explored with more subtlety through a range of characters, and the image of the Aussie bloke immortalised in the character of Mick Dundee is made to look a dated simplification. Still, this onslaught of camp sometimes proves too much, even for some of the films' characters. As Bernadette (played by Stamp) tells her fellow drag queens at one point in ""Priscilla"": ""I'll join this conversation on the proviso that we stop bitching about people, talking about wigs, dresses, bust sizes, penises, drugs, night clubs, and bloody Abba!"" To which Weaving's character Tick snaps back: ""Doesn't give us much to talk about then, does it?""","""Hey, Hey It's Esther Blueburger"" is the latest comedy film to come out of Australia .
Like many successful Australian comedies it relies on a high dose of kitsch .
Films like ""Strictly Ballroom"" have subverted the macho Aussie stereotype .

"LONDON, England (CNN) --     Editor's note: Watch Tarantino talking about the making of ""Pulp Fiction"" on The Screening Room podcast. To receive regular movie podcasts subscribe here. Quentin Tarantino's first trip to Sundance wasn't exactly a success. Tarantino's hyper-violent, super cool debut feature ""Reservoir Dogs"" scorched audiences and critics alike when it came out in 1992. ""If you do this in real life, they're going to fire your ass,"" scolded cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt, veteran of films like ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Charlie Wilson's War."" The novice filmmaker was participating in a directors' workshop at the Sundance Institute -- the film trust founded by Robert Redford which also runs the Sundance Film Festival. Unfortunately, Tarantino's mentors were just not feeling his experimental approach. The following week, a new group of mentors arrived, including ex-Monty Python member and filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Tarantino and his editor steeled themselves for the inevitable disapproval: ""Then Terry Gilliam comes in and goes 'Oh, your scene. Just great!'"" recalls the director. He is talking at the Cannes Film Festival Cinema Masterclass, following in the illustrious footsteps of directors like Wong Kar Wai, Sydney Pollack and Martin Scorsese. ""It was just like, you know what, that's gonna be my career. People are gonna either really like me or they're really not and just get f***ing used to it 'cause this is the deal,"" Tarantino says. A second visit to Sundance in 1992 proved more fruitful. His debut feature, ""Reservoir Dogs,"" a sassy, hyper-violent gangster movie, was the hit of the year. French film critic and regular on the European film festival circuit, Michel Ciment still remembers the effect it had on him when it showed at Cannes later that year: ""It was a big shock. I remember it was the most striking new American film since 'Mean Streets' 30 years before."" Despite the impact of his droll, assured debut, Tarantino recalls being convinced he was going to get fired in the first two weeks of production. ""I just thought it was too good to be true. I couldn't help but think something like 'they don't let people like me make movies,'"" he says, laughing. Follow-up movie ""Pulp Fiction"" was awarded the coveted Palm D'Or at Cannes two years later, cementing his reputation as a movie-maker to be reckoned with. It was filled with the dark humor and bloody violence that would become known as Tarantino trademarks. The B-movie-obsessed director admits to getting a kick out of creating humor in inappropriate situations. ""I'm trying to get you to laugh at things you've never laughed at before,"" he explains. He cites his ""bigtime"" influences as movie brats like Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, as well as Sergio Leone and Howard Hawks. In person, he is a great raconteur and his expletive-littered speech is not a million miles away from the dialogue that's so central to his movies. ""I tend to think of myself as more of a novelist who makes movies than a director per se,"" he declares. But he dismisses his apparent love of language as a product of writing for acting classes: ""I started writing as an actor and it was all about dialogue and writing scenes to do."" Before moving into directing, Tarantino studied acting for six years and says learning to act for the camera gave him an insight into how directors put a movie together -- frame by frame. That was what really taught him how to write for the movies. ""All of a sudden I started seeing [film] in a whole different way. When you start doing that, then it's only a few short steps until you start composing shots of your own,"" he explains. Tarantino has shown himself to be one of the most music-savvy directors of this generation with his use of songs like ""Little Green Bag"" by the George Baker Selection in the opening sequence of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" in ""Kill Bill Vol. 1."" He, not immodestly, puts that skill down to his great music collection. ""The thing is, I have one of the best soundtrack collections in America,"" he boasts. That probably accounts for his scathing determination never to use film composers: ""I don't trust any composers to do it. I would just never give anybody that kind of responsibility,"" he says, ""Who the f*** is this guy coming in here, throwing their s*** all over my movie?"" And he admits that his inner film buff enjoys the cornerstones of action cinema that some of his later movies have explored. ""I love action scenes, but they are hard, and in a way that's what's fun about them. These cool little puzzles. To me, action scenes are some of the most cinematic moments that you can do in film,"" he says. ""Kill Bill Vol. One"" and ""Kill Bill Vol. Two,"" starring Tarantino muse and Hollywood A-lister Uma Thurman, are his movie-geek nod to the kung fu genre. When he started filming ""Vol. One,"" Tarantino hadn't made a film for six years and with typical chutzpah challenged himself to choreograph astonishingly intricate fight scenes. ""If I throw my hat in the ring with the greatest action directors who ever lived ... I wanna be as good as them,"" he asserts. He continues to work his way through his action movie checklist. In his latest movie, ""Death Proof,"" a homage to sleazy 70s B-movies that stars Kurt Russell as a murderous stuntman, he puts his own spin on another of action film's fundamentals -- the car chase. Tarantino is critical of CGI being used so much in film today. All the seat-grippingly tense stunts in ""Death Proof"" are real and he specifically cast a stuntwoman, Zoe Bell, in one of the leading roles to achieve this. It may have been ambitious, but ""Death Proof,"" which is one half of ""Grindhouse,"" a B-movie-referencing double bill he made with fellow director Robert Rodriguez, got a critical mauling and didn't fare much better at the box office. But then Tarantino has long been resigned to people either loving or hating his movies.","""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Kill Bill"" director Quentin Tarantino talks about his films .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Scientist and author Stephen Hawking is ""very ill"" and has been hospitalized, according to Cambridge University, where he is a professor. Stephen Hawking in Pasadena, California, in March. Cambridge University said the 67-year-old is ""comfortable"" and will stay overnight at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge. Hawking, one of the world's most famous physicists, is also a cosmologist, astronomer, and mathematician. Wheelchair-bound Hawking is perhaps most famous for ""A Brief History of Time,"" which explored the origins of the universe in layman's terms. The book is considered a modern classic. Hawking has Lou Gehrig's Disease (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS), which is usually fatal after three years. Hawking has survived for more than 40 years since his diagnosis. On his Web site, Hawking has written about living with ALS. ""I try to lead as normal a life as possible, and not think about my condition, or regret the things it prevents me from doing, which are not that many,"" he wrote. He added: ""I have been lucky, that my condition has progressed more slowly than is often the case. But it shows that one need not lose hope."" The disease has left him paralyzed -- he is able to move only a few fingers on one hand. Hawking is completely dependent on others or technology for virtually everything -- bathing, dressing, eating, even speech. He uses a speech synthesizer with an American accent. Hawking has been married and divorced twice. In 2004, police completed an investigation into accusations by Hawking's daughter that his second wife was abusing him. Authorities said they found no proof. His Web site says he has three children and one grandchild. Hawking was born in Oxford, England, on what turned out to be an auspicious date: January 8, 1942 -- the 300th anniversary of the death of astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei. A Cambridge University spokesman told CNN: ""Professor Hawking is very ill and has been taken by ambulance to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge."" Professor Peter Haynes, head of the university's department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, said: ""Professor Hawking is a remarkable colleague, we all hope he will be amongst us again soon."" At Cambridge, he holds the position of Lucasian Professor Mathematics -- the prestigious post held from 1669 to 1702 by Sir Isaac Newton. Hawking has guest-starred, as himself, on Star Trek: The Next Generation and The Simpsons. He also said if he had the choice of meeting Newton or Marilyn Monroe, his choice would be Marilyn. In October, CNN's Becky Anderson interviewed Hawking. The following are some quotes from that interview: . ""Over the last twenty years, observations have to a large extent confirmed the picture I painted in 'A Brief History of Time.' The one major development that was not anticipated was the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating now, rather than slowing down... We live in the most probable of all possible worlds."" CNN's Jennifer Pifer contributed to this report .","Physicist Stephen Hawking hospitalized Monday in ""very ill"" condition .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- One of the most destructive moments in Chinese history is bringing together -- at least temporarily -- this vast nation of more than a billion people, made up of disparate ethnic groups stretching across five time zones. Thousands chant ""China, keep moving"" during a rally in Chengdu's Tianfu Square. When millions of Chinese paused for three minutes of silence Monday, they personified the surge in patriotism and charity that has swept this country since a massive 7.9 magnitude earthquake leveled large sections of Sichuan province in southwestern China. Moments after the observance ended, chants of ""Go, China, Go!"" broke out in Tiananmen Square, where a Chinese military crackdown in 1989 left hundreds dead. Sentiments have changed since the days of the anti-government protests. ""As Chinese we must be united,"" said a student. ""We Chinese can do it!"" Some of Monday's demonstrators waved Chinese flags while others hoisted banners with slogans like ""Rebuild Sichuan!"" iReport.com: Thousands rally in Chengdu . Horrific scenes of death and devastation -- covered heavily by the local media -- have triggered a surge of patriotism and charity. ""When one is in trouble,"" the Chinese say, ""help comes from all directions."" In Beijing, Chinese officials, entertainers, athletes and artists attended a marathon concert, giving donations and calling on the public to give more. The benefit concert raised more than 1.51 billion yuan, or $216 million. More donations are pouring in through other channels. Watch report on how quake has united Chinese » . As of Sunday, Chinese nationals had donated more than 4.9 billion yuan ($700 million) in cash and goods for earthquake relief, according to China's Ministry of Civil Affairs. Live on Chinese TV, local businesses pledged to give money and build free housing for victims -- an unusual display of civic charity. As of last Saturday, Chinese enterprises had donated more than 3.5 billion yuan ($501 million) in cash and relief goods. ""Traditionally the Chinese people don't share as much with strangers. They share a great deal among friends and family, but not with strangers,"" according to China analyst Zhang Daxing. At The Bookworm, a Beijing bookstore, residents drop off relief goods that are promptly shipped to disaster areas. ""My guess would be about 350 boxes, which include kid's clothes, adult clothes, a lot of sleeping bags, tents, dried food, shoes, that type of stuff,"" said store owner Alex Pearson. Students in the Chinese capital have even taken to the street to collect donations. ""Although we cannot go to Sichuan to save them, we can still help them with donated money,"" one student said. Analysts say this unprecedented display of charity is partly in response to the quick action already taken by Chinese officials to the emergency. The Chinese media have repeatedly shown Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao comforting survivors. Many believe this has inspired Chinese residents to do what they can to help. Meantime, a new image of China is emerging around the world. ""The earthquake changed China's international image from an oppressor or an authoritarian government to a victim of natural disaster and human tragedy,"" said Wenfang Tang, professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh. The Chinese, at least for now, are more united as a people and more charitable, as citizens pull together in the wake of a massive earthquake.

"(CNN) -- The Pulitzer Prize winners for 2009 were announced Monday, with The New York Times capturing five of the awards. Writer Jon Meacham won a Pulitzer Prize in biography for ""American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House."" The Times garnered wins in the categories of breaking news reporting, investigative reporting, international reporting, criticism and feature photography. In the international reporting category, The Times won for its reporting on the battles in Afghanistan and Pakistan. In the arts, ""Olive Kitteridge"" by Elizabeth Strout won for fiction, ""Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II"" by Douglas A. Blackmon won in the general nonfiction category, and ""American Lion: Andrew Jackson in the White House"" by Jon Meacham won for the category of biography. Among the winners in journalism categories were the Las Vegas (Nevada) Sun for public service, the San Diego (California) Union-Tribune's Steve Breen for editorial cartooning and columnist Eugene Robinson of The Washington Post for commentary. For the first time, all 14 Pulitzer journalism categories were open for competition from news organizations that publish only on the Internet. Entirely online entries were previously permitted in only two categories: breaking news coverage and breaking news photography . Since 2006, online content from newspaper Web sites had been permitted in all Pulitzer journalism categories, but online-only newspapers were not allowed to submit entries. Despite the opportunity, there were no winners from online only news sites. Web sites for print magazines and broadcast outlets are not eligible to enter, said Sig Gissler, administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes. Amy Mitchell, deputy director for the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism, said that allowing online-only publications to apply for the prestigious award is recognition of the growing importance of online media. ""Much of [media] comes from traditional press, but a lot is coming from non-traditional press as well, and that needs to be recognized along with what's being produced in traditional media,"" she said. ""We've clearly hit a point now where we've seen the audience migration to the Web accelerate."" Mitchell said a survey of online journalists conducted by the Project for Excellence in Journalism found some concerns about the possibility of online reporting changing the fundamental values of journalism. Those surveyed cited issues like a focus on speed and loss of accuracy as possible issues that could arise with journalism on the Web. But with those concerns, Mitchell said, comes the opportunity to tell stories in a multidimensional way. ""We see some tremendous reporting that could not exist in former modes of communication,"" she said, observing that media platforms such as text, photo galleries and video can not only be connected but be used to connect journalists to Internet users and Internet users to each other. ""Those are tremendous changes,"" she said. Robert M. Steele, the Eugene S. Pulliam Distinguished Visiting Professor of Journalism at DePauw University in Indiana, said the core values of accuracy and fairness have to be honored, no matter the method of reporting. Still, Steele said, further opening the Pulitzer Prizes to online publications ""gives further weight to the role that digital journalism plays in this era."" ""In some ways, it's increased legitimacy for new forms of delivering journalism,"" Steele said. ""It also heightens the discussion about the distinction between basic information and substantive journalism. Just because somebody throws something online doesn't mean it is journalism."" David Plotz, editor of Slate, said his site did not apply for the Pulitzers despite what he believes was his publication's exceptional political, technology and business coverage. ""We are not a hard-news site, and we don't do the kinds of stories and projects that have traditionally been awarded,"" Plotz said. Plotz said the recognition for online journalism is more than warranted. ""It's an overdue acknowledgement that some of the best journalism in the world and in America is being created not for print publication but for places that live entirely on the Web,"" he said. ""There's so much of it that doesn't ever get into a print publication and yet is as important to shaping the debate and to changing how people think about things as to anything you might read in one of our great newspapers or magazines."" Pulitzer Prizes for journalism were also awarded to the following: Bettina Boxall and Julie Cart of the Los Angeles (California) Times for explanatory reporting; the Detroit (Michigan) Free Press Staff, and notably Jim Schaefer and M.L. Elrick and Ryan Gabrielson and Paul Giblin of the East Valley (Arizona) Tribune for local reporting; and the staff of the St. Petersburg (Florida) Times for national reporting. Also receiving awards were Lane DeGregory of the St. Petersburg Times for feature writing; Mark Mahoney of The Glens Falls (New York) Post-Star for editorial writing; and Patrick Farrell of The Miami (Florida) Herald for breaking news photography. In the arts, ""Ruined"" by Lynn Nottage won for drama; ""The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family"" by Annette Gordon-Reed won for history; ""The Shadow of Sirius"" by W.S. Merwin won the poetry category; ""Double Sextet"" by Steve Reich won for music.","Prizes were awarded Monday for excellence in journalism and the arts .

"Editor's note: Dan Buettner is the best-selling author of ""The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer from the People Who've Lived the Longest.""   Watch Buettner's reports from Greece all week on ""AC360°"" Greek-American Yiannis Karimalis, 73,  lives in Ikaria nearly 40 years after a diagnosis of stomach cancer. Ikaria, GREECE (CNN) -- In 1970, when doctors diagnosed Greek-American Yiannis Karimalis with stomach cancer and only gave him a few months to live, he decided to move back to Ikaria, his birth island. There, he reasoned, he could be buried more inexpensively among his fellow Greeks.   But when he moved back to the island he didn't die. He has lived nearly 40 years more. And when he returned to America on a recent visit, he discovered that his doctors were all dead. The people on this 99-square-mile Greek island in the eastern Aegean Sea smugly tell this story as yet another example of what they've always known and scientists are now discovering: People in Ikaria live longer than in just about any other place in the world. A recent study of 90-year-old siblings, conducted by the National Hellenic Research Foundation, discovered 10 times more 90-year-old brothers and sisters here than the European average. Why is this important? Most scientists agree that the average human should live to age 90. (You have to have won the genetic lottery to live to 100.) But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says life expectancy in America is 78. Somewhere along the line, we're losing about a dozen years -- most of them to costly and potentially preventable chronic diseases such as heart attacks, diabetes and cancer. These diseases are dragging down our health care system and account for much of the reason why the National Institute on Aging says the average American suffers about three disabled end-of-life years during which they incur 90 percent of our lifelong health care costs.   Ikarians are avoiding these diseases and reaching age 90 at a rate of about four times the rate that Americans do. They are getting the good years we're missing, dying quickly and less expensively. For the next two weeks, I'm leading ""The Blue Zones"" expedition, an AARP and National Geographic sponsored team of the world's best demographers, physicians, medical researchers and media specialists, to explore Ikarian longevity. We already have a few clues. Since at least the sixth century B.C., Icaria was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans as a health destination -- largely for its hot springs believed to relieve pain, joint problems and skin ailments. Our team has reviewed reports of high levels of radon in these baths and will be exploring a theory that chronic exposure to low-level radiation may help protect DNA against the ravages of aging. For much of the ensuing two millenniums, people here lived in relative isolation. The people here evolved a unique diet that we believe is a more heart-protective version of the Mediterranean diet. We're doing pharmacological analyses of dozens of herbal teas and unique honey produced by bees that draw pollen of thyme, fir and erica. We think we'll find anti-cancer, anti-oxidant and probiotic properties in these locally produced products. We also know that people here have a vastly different character than the rest of the Mediterranean. They have volcanic tempers that quickly subside. Despite living on harsh, steep terrain, they're known for relentless optimism and three-day parties. They don't get stressed by deadlines. They go to bed well after midnight, sleep late and take naps. Anecdotally, we know that most people over 90 are sexually active. Do these people possess the true secret to longevity? We're not sure yet, but we'll certainly distill a few clues about living longer, better. Ikarian wisdom may not help you live to 100. But at least they may help you outlive your doctor.

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff arrived in Pakistan on Tuesday amid tensions between the two countries about U.S. military incursions into Pakistan's tribal areas. Adm. Michael Mullen will meet with Pakistan's new prime minister and its military chief. Adm. Michael Mullen will meet with Pakistan's newly elected prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, and Pakistan's military chief, Gen. Parvez Kayani, Mullen's office said. Relations between the United States and Pakistan have been tense since the U.S. military sent ground forces into Pakistan's tribal regions earlier this month without Islamabad's permission. The incident prompted the Pakistani government to summon the U.S. ambassador to voice its disapproval, as well as deliver a ""demarche"" (a diplomatic petition or protest) through its ambassador in Washington. Last week, Kayani announced no foreign forces will be allowed to conduct operations inside Pakistan in light of the ""reckless"" U.S. military ground operation. Kayani said Pakistan's ""territorial integrity ... will be defended at all cost and no external force is allowed to conduct operations ... inside Pakistan."" His announcement came amid media reports that several months ago, President Bush authorized U.S. special forces to carry out ground assaults inside Pakistan without first seeking Islamabad's permission. Meanwhile, a suicide attack late Tuesday evening in the restive area of Swat killed three soldiers and wounded six others, the Pakistani military told CNN. Pakistan army spokesman Major Murad Khan said the driver of the suicide car bomb tried to ram the gate of a military checkpoint at a school in the Swat District. Troops shot from the check-post before the attacker reached his target, Khan said. The car exploded, and militants shot back as they ran away. The incident happened at a time when Muslims break their fasts in the month of Ramadhan. Swat militants loyal to banned religious leader Maulana Fazlullah have claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the military. The suicide attacker in the car was killed. A few others were also believed to have been killed or injured, but Khan said there were no confirmed numbers because it was dark and the militants removed the bodies of their dead and wounded. The explosion occurred at the Tutano Bandai school of Tehsil Kabal in Swat District in the North West Frontier Province. A military spokesman offer no additional details. CNN's Jamie McIntyre and Zein Basravi contributed to this report.","Adm. Michael Mullen to meet with Pakistan's new prime minister and military chief .

"(CNN) -- A federal immigration board rejected an emergency appeal Friday for a stay of deportation filed by the lawyer for Nazi war crimes suspect John Demjanjuk. John Demjanjuk, shown at his 1993 Israel acquittal, is sought by Germany for alleged killings at a Nazi camp. The decision by the Department of Justice's Board of Immigration Appeals in Falls Church, Virginia, clears the way for Demjanjuk's deportation to Germany, where he is being sought for his alleged involvement during World War II in killings at Sobibor, a Nazi death camp in Poland. The deportation of Demjanjuk would close a chapter in one of the longest-running pursuits of an alleged Holocaust perpetrator in history, while also paving the way for an extraordinary German war crimes trial. Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement are now free to pick up Demjanjuk at any point and take him into custody for transport to Germany, a board official said. The appeals board rejected Demjanjuk's emergency stay request because it concluded ""there is little likelihood of success that his pending motion to re-open the case will be granted,"" according to board officials. The pending motion argues that a deportation of Demjanjuk, 89, to Germany would constitute torture. ""In the four years since his deportation was [initially] ordered, his health has seriously deteriorated,"" Demjanjuk's attorney, John Broadley, told CNN in a recent telephone interview. Broadley said Demjanjuk suffers from pre-leukemia, kidney problems, spinal problems and ""a couple of types of gout."" The board, however, has already signaled that argument will be rejected. Demjanjuk may make an additional expedited appeal for an emergency stay to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, though his chances of getting the board's ruling overturned are believed to be slim, according to Justice Department officials. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center found irony in Broadley's argument for his client. ""He wants to plead the sense of fairness that he regularly denied all of the victims at Sobibor,"" Hier said. Hier called Demjanjuk's comparison of his planned deportation to torture ""preposterous coming from a person that served the [Nazi organization] S.S. in a death camp.

""You were there for one job: kill the Jews,"" he said. ""And that's what they did full-time."" He called the evidence against Demjanjuk ""overwhelming."" German authorities issued an arrest warrant for Demjanjuk on March 10, accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at the death camp from March to September 1943. They studied an identification card provided by the U.S. Office of Special Investigations, and concluded it was genuine, before issuing the warrant. Demjanjuk, a retired autoworker living in Cleveland, Ohio, has been fighting charges of Nazi war crimes for more than two decades. He was previously extradited from the United States to Israel, where he was convicted in 1986 of being ""Ivan the Terrible,"" a guard at the notorious Treblinka extermination camp. The conviction was overturned by Israeli courts on appeal, and he returned to the United States. The United States filed new charges against him in 1999, again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard. He was stripped of U.S. citizenship and has been awaiting deportation since 2005, despite fighting his case all the way to the Supreme Court. Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian, says he fought in the Soviet army and later was a prisoner of war held by the Germans.

"(CNN) -- The Sri Lankan army launched an operation against Tamil rebels in the country's north early Monday, the military said, claiming to have rescued thousands of civilians trapped in a government safe zone. The Sri Lankan army has relaunched its attacks on Tamil rebels in the country's north. A rebel Web site, TamilNet, said government forces were engaged in a fresh ground offensive. A TamilNet correspondent in Vanni reported heavy shelling, rocket fire and gunfire. Thirty civilians died in shelling Sunday, rebels said. The government of Sri Lanka has been battling the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) rebels in a civil conflict that has lasted nearly 25 years. ""Thousands of civilians who had been forcibly held by the LTTE terrorists in the government declared No Fire Zone (NFZ) were rescued early hours this morning, 20 April, as the troops engaged in a massive scale rescue mission, were able to open a safe passage for the civilians,"" the Ministry of Defense Web site said. More than 10,000 civilians are trying to seek refuge with soldiers, the military said. The upsurge in hostilities follows a two-day cessation last week for the Sinhala and Hindu New Year. The U.S. State Department on Thursday called for a cease-fire between the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tigers to allow civilians to escape the fighting. ""We call upon the government and military of Sri Lanka, and the Tamil Tigers, to immediately stop hostilities until the more than 140,000 civilians in the conflict area are safely out,"" acting spokesman Robert Wood said in a statement. ""Both sides must immediately return to a humanitarian pause and both must respect the right of free movement of those civilian men, women and children trapped by the fighting.""  Watch the heavy toll of fighting on civilians » . A brief cessation of hostilities  announced by the Sri Lankan government on April 12 allowed the United Nations and its partners to bring in aid, but a renewed government offensive has left civilians trapped in a war zone. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his humanitarian chief John Holmes called the brief halt in fighting inadequate and have pushed for a longer humanitarian pause in fighting. The most pressing concern now, according to Holmes, is the fact that more than 100,000 people are crowded in a ""very small pocket of land"" that is about five square miles, or about twice the size of New York's Central Park. ""It is a very small area indeed for what we believe is a very large number of people,"" Holmes told reporters Wednesday. Overcrowding is also a problem in camps housing displaced people, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). As of Monday, some 65,000 displaced people were crammed into camps in Vavuniya, Jaffna and Mannar, with 35,000 more expected to arrive within 48 hours, the organization said in a statement. ' UNICEF said it feared for children trapped in the escalating fighting and is worried that the worst is yet to come. The group appealed for donations to help cover ""the most immediate needs of the affected population in health and nutrition, water and sanitation, protection and education."" The crowded population, primarily comprised of Tamil civilians, is subject to the continuing Sri Lankan government assaults. The British and French foreign ministers released a joint statement as well on Wednesday, saying that the Tamil Tigers are using Tamil civilians as human shields. The Tigers have been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States and the European Union. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the conflict officially began in 1983. The International Committee of the Red Cross said Monday that it has helped evacuate more than 10,000 sick and injured patients, and their caregivers, from Putumattalan in rebel-held territory since February. ""These evacuations have saved many lives,"" said Morven Murchinson, the Red Cross medical coordinator in Sri Lanka. ""It is vital that they continue, because more sick and wounded people are arriving every day at the makeshift medical facilities in Putumattalan."" The Red Cross says there's an acute shortage of medical supplies in the region, which it is trying to rectify.","NEW: Fears voiced by UNICEF for children trapped in the escalating fighting .

"(CNN) -- The women hockey players gathered at the center of the rink and prayed. Tears wet their cheeks and most held hands. Then they lit 10 candles, the number on the jersey of the missing teammate, the one with the huge smile and even bigger heart, who died in last week's plane crash. Madeline Loftus, 24, was killed aboard Flight 3407. She was returning to Buffalo for a reunion hockey game. Madeline Loftus, known as Maddy, was one of 49 people to die aboard Continental Connection Flight 3407 last Thursday. She was returning to Buffalo State College to play in a reunion hockey game on Saturday, to meet up with her old classmates to play the game she loved so dearly. ""She popped into my head every time I got back to the bench,"" said former teammate Emma Wadsworth. Breaking down in tears, she said the game was filled with sadness because ""Maddy wasn't here."" She described Loftus as an ""awesome teammate, a beautiful person always smiling, and always upbeat, and ready to cheer you up if you were having a bad day.""  Watch a promising life cut short » . ""She was just amazing,"" Wadsworth said. Her teammates said they decided to play the game out, because Loftus would've wanted them to play on. Loftus' No. 10 jersey hung from the bench near her friends and former players. ""It's a really hard time for her teammates, for her friends, for her family,"" said teammate Janelle Junior. Loftus, 24, of Parsippany, New Jersey, played two seasons at Buffalo State from 2002 to 2004 before transferring to St. Mary's University in Minnesota after her sophomore year. At St. Mary's, she was a marketing major who starred on the hockey team from 2004 to 2006. While there, Loftus helped form the Cardinal Athletic Council, a student-athlete outreach program to help with community service projects. ""Madeline was an important part of the university and athletic communities. Our thoughts and prayers now turn to Madeline's family, friends and teammates as they cope with this sudden loss,"" St. Mary's athletic director Nikki Fennern said in a statement. ""Maddy was the first senior to graduate from my program. She will always hold a special place in my heart,"" said Terry Mannor, St. Mary's women's hockey coach. ""Everyone who knew her will remember someone full of life and compassion. She was loved by everyone and will be greatly missed."" Officials in Buffalo have said that it may take several days before all the bodies are recovered from the crash site, as investigators work through freezing temperatures and piles of wreckage.  See photos of the crash site » . About 1,000 people gathered at a church in western New York Monday to remember the crash victims. The community memorialized the 50 victims, with religious leaders from Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Hindu communities offering words of sympathy to the community. ""We've gathered today because western New York has entered a season of grieving,"" said Pastor Karl Eastlack of the Eastern Hills Wesleyan Church. Each speaker emphasized that everyone in the community is connected by the tragedy. One leader said we ""gather in our common desire to console one another."" All 49 passengers and crew members aboard the 74-seat turboprop were killed when the plane crashed into a home in Clarence Center, New York, on Thursday night. A 61-year-old man in the house was also killed. While investigators try to piece together the cause of the crash, portraits of those who died aboard the flight have emerged: . • Alison Des Forges spent four years in Rwanda documenting the 1994 genocide and had testified about that atrocity and the current situation in central Africa before U.N. and congressional panels. • Beverly Eckert was the widow of Sean Rooney, who died in the World Trade Center in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. After Sean's death, Eckert co-founded Voices of September 11, an advocacy group for survivors of the attacks and families of those killed. • Gerry Niewood was traveling with jazz guitarist Coleman Mellett for a show with musician Chuck Mangione and the Buffalo Philharmonic at Kleinhans Music Hall. • Co-pilot Rebecca Shaw's father said she loved to fly and ""couldn't believe she'd get paid"" when she took the job. Learn more about the victims . On the ice rink in Buffalo Saturday, Loftus' friends played with a heavy heart. This would have been her first time on the ice with her former Buffalo State teammates since her playing days. Jessica Aykroyd said she had spoken with Loftus right before she left for the airport. ""The last thing I have is: Can't wait to see you,"" Aykroyd said. Lindsay Welch said simply, ""Her friends and hockey is what she was all about."" So passionate about hockey, Loftus was the first female to play on the boys' team in high school. In college, when she wasn't playing, she worked as a student assistant for the ice rink. ""She was a great student, she was a great hockey player and just a great person. Everybody loved being around her,"" said rink manager Jim Fowler. Those who knew her in Minnesota agreed. ""Her classmates were always eager to work with her on projects,"" said Thomas Marpe, dean of St. Mary's School of Business. ""Maddy was enthusiastic about life and especially about women's hockey.""

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen has claimed responsibility for Friday's suicide bombing attack on a building housing Yemeni security forces. Al Qaeda in Yemen have claimed that Ahmed bin Said bin Omar al-Mashjari, right, carried out Friday's attack. ""This attack was carried out in revenge for our brothers whose blood is on the hands of the infidel Yemeni forces,"" according to an e-mailed statement that included a photo of the alleged suicide attacker. The photo identifies the attacker as Ahmed bin Said bin Omar al-Mashjari -- also known as Abu Dajjana al-Hadarmi -- from Yemen's Hadramout governate where the attack took place. He is standing next to another man whose face is covered in front of a black-and-white banner. Both men have weapons slung across their shoulders; guns and ammunition belts are also pictured beneath the banner in the background. Al-Mashjari is wearing a black and white head covering, but his face is visible. The e-mailed statement was dated July 25, the day of the attack, but it was distributed and posted online on Sunday. According to Yemen's state-run news agency SABA, a suicide car bomber crashed the white 2003 KIA into the gates of the security camp in the southern city of Sayoun on Friday, prompting guards to open fire on the attacker. The SABA report gave no details on casualties. Yemen's Interior Ministry said four people were killed and 12 were injured, but the Yemen Post, an English-language newspaper that covers events in Yemen, put the number at 10 dead and about a dozen wounded. Hadramout's governor Saleh al-Khanbashi described the bombing as a criminal terrorist act, and threatened to track down and bring to justice those responsible, SABA reported.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- North Korea is to blow up a key part of its controversial Yongbyon nuclear reactor on Friday. Hyun Hak-Bong (right), North Korea's deputy negotiator to six-party talks, crosses the border into South Korea on June 5. The destruction of the plant's cooling tower is part of an agreement with the United States aimed at denuclearizing the Korean peninsula in exchange for loosening some restrictions on the highly secretive Communist country. The North Korean government has invited news organizations, including CNN, to witness the event. Earlier this year, Pyongyang agreed to disable its nuclear reactor and provide a full accounting of its plutonium stockpile, ""acknowledge"" concerns about its proliferation activities and its uranium enrichment activity, and agree to continue cooperation with a verification process to ensure no further activities are taking place. North Korea has been taking Yongbyon's main reactor apart, but imploding the cooling tower is an exceptionally important psychological step given that the highly recognizable shape of the structure is synonymous with nuclear power plants. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, says it would take a year to rebuild if North Korea decided to go back on its agreement, and that the construction could not be done in secret. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice defended U.S. diplomacy toward North Korea last week, saying the deal with Pyongyang made Asia and the U.S. safer. Speaking at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank, Rice said that ""North Korea will soon give its declaration of nuclear programs to China."" China is the host of the six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear program, along with Russia, South Korea, Japan and the United States. Rice spoke in advance of her upcoming trip to Asia where she will be attending a meeting of G8 foreign ministers and meeting with her Asian counterparts. Rice said once North Korea submits its declaration, President Bush will notify Congress he intends to remove North Korea from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism and scrap some sanctions levied against North Korea because of nuclear concerns. But she noted that there would be no practical effect to loosening the restrictions because North Korea still was under the same sanctions because of other areas of U.S. law. Rice said a 45-day review would then begin to see if North Korea is telling the truth and living up to its end of the deal struck in the six-party talks. ""Before those actions go into effect, we would continue to assess the level of North Korean cooperation in helping to verify the accuracy and completeness of its declaration,"" she said. ""And if that cooperation is insufficient, we will respond accordingly."" The United States softened its demand that North Korea publicly admit to having a highly enriched uranium program and to providing Syria with nuclear technology, key unanswered questions that have left negotiations stalled for months. North Korea has already handed over about 18,000 documents on its nuclear past to the U.S., which the U.S. says are critical to verify North Korea's claims. Rice said that the deal with North Korea wasn't perfect but offered the U.S. the best chance to learn about North Korea's nuclear history. ""We must keep the broader goal in mind: the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons and programs, all of them,"" she said. ""North Korea has said that it is committed to this goal. We'll see."" Rice said that ""no final agreement can be concluded"" unless the U.S. verifies North Korea's claims.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Police officers responsible for protecting the British royal family handled firearms when drunk, traded pornography and steroids and sat on Queen Elizabeth II's throne in comical poses, it has been alleged in a London court. The former royal protection officer was responsible for security at Buckingham Palace. The allegations were made Tuesday by John Cooper, the lawyer for former royal protection officer Paul Page, who is accused of defrauding colleagues and friends to fund a life of luxury, The British Press Association reported. According to PA, the claims were made during a lengthy cross-examination of Adam McGregor, a colleague of Page who left service at London's Buckingham Palace in 2005, who has accused the former officer of ""conning"" him out of thousands of dollars. At one point Cooper ""suggested"" there had been a procedure among armed officers at the palace whereby one officer on duty would sleep while the others kept watch for their superior. McGregor denied any knowledge of this and all other allegations of wrongdoing among his colleagues at the iconic Royal residence. However, when pressed further he did admit to sitting on one of the thrones, but did not recall doing any ""comical poses."" The court also heard that officers protecting the royals lost more than £250,000 ($365,800) to a spread betting venture called ""The Currency Club,"" one of a number of apparently successful sidelines Page allegedly set up to clear spiraling debts, PA said. According to the BBC, Page extracted around £3 million ($4.4 million) from some 57 lenders or investors. Cooper suggested that McGregor had been ""one of those police officers"" using mobile patrols to deliver cash to other police officers based in Royal Protection who were involved in financial matters. The accusation was again denied by McGregor. He instead claimed he had been ""totally sucked in"" by Page. ""I was totally sucked in by Paul he is a very charismatic person,"" he said, before adding that he had acted ""very naively and very stupidly"" in some of his dealings with his former colleague. The prosecution claimed much of the money was promptly laundered by Page's wife before being gambled away, as Page himself hid his dishonesty behind a "" veneer of credibility"" fueled by a fleet of expensive cars and claims he was a highly ""adept"" property developer and market speculator, PA said. Father of five Page, 37, from Essex in south-east England, has denied five charges -- two of fraudulent trading, one of intimidation, threatening to take revenge and making a threat to kill between January 1, 2003 and March 30, 2007. His wife Laura, 42, denied ""being concerned in an arrangement facilitating dealings with criminal property,"" intimidation and threatening to kill.","Paul and Laura Page accused of defrauding colleagues to fund a life of luxury .

"(CNN)  -- Former Italian international star Filippo Inzaghi scored a hat-trick as AC Milan went second in Serie A with a 5-1 win over Torino in the San Siro on Sunday. Beckham and Mathieu Flamini take part in an unusual goal celebration in the San Siro. The legendary goalscorer has now put away nine in the last six matches but it was his combination with England international David Beckham which electrified the Milan fans. Beckham, who had sat out the last two games because of a shoulder injury, set up Inzaghi for his opening two goals in the 13th and 37th minutes from a corner and a clever chip, both headed home. After the interval, Inzaghi completed his hat-trick on the hour mark before Kaka added a penalty for the fourth. Ivan Franceschini pulled one back for Torino in the 80th minute, but Massimo Ambrosini rounded off the Milan scoring in the final minute. The win sees Milan level on points with Juventus but with a better goal difference. They trail leaders Inter by 10 points. In the battle for the fourth and final Champions League qualifying spot, AS Roma beat Lecce 3-2 with captain Francesco Totti scoring twice. Fifth-placed Fiorentina hardly helped their cause with a 3-1 defeat to Udinese, missing the chance to move a place higher after Genoa lost 1-0 at home to Lazio on Saturday. Improving Roma are now three points behind Fiorentina and five adrift of fourth-placed Genoa. Kwadwo Asamoah put Udinese ahead in the 10th minute lead and Gaetano D'Agostino doubled the lead from the penalty spot early in the second half.

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Spike Lee's last film, the gratifyingly tense and tricky ""Inside Man,"" was celebrated -- rightly -- for the way that Lee finally jumped, feet first, into the studio-genre-movie game. Director Spike Lee poses for a shot during the filming of ""Miracle at St. Anna"" in Rome, Italy. He cooked up a gourmet-popcorn heist thriller and stamped every moment with his personality. Lee, until now, has never made a movie -- good or bad -- that wasn't unmistakably his. His latest, ""Miracle at St. Anna,"" is the first Hollywood feature to tell the story of the African-American soldiers who fought in the U.S. armed forces during World War II , and as such it's a movie with a monumental mission. Unfortunately, that's more or less the only monumental thing about it. ""Miracle"" isn't powerful, it's muddled and diffuse, and the disappointment of the film begins with what a hard time I had finding Spike Lee in it. Based on a 2002 novel by James McBride, who also wrote the screenplay, the movie has a drifting, scattershot structure and no real organizing tone or style (if you wondered what Lee's frozen-figure-on-receding-background shots might look like in a wartime setting, then keep wondering). The bizarrely contrived framing device is set in the 1980s, when a postal worker named Hector Negron (Laz Alonso) mutters in anger at an old John Wayne war flick on TV, then shoots and kills a man who shows up to buy stamps. (He surely has his reasons, but does he really get away with stashing a loaded Luger under his post-office window each day?)  Watch Spike Lee talk about the film » . After his arrest, Hector won't talk, but a reporter finds a clue in the form of a priceless artifact hidden in his apartment: the head of a statue that once adorned a bridge in Florence that was wrecked by bombs during World War II. From this labored and gimmicky setup, the film flashes back to the itch and fear of battle, as Hector, along with other members of the all-black 92nd Infantry Division and its ''Buffalo Soldiers,'' stalks the Tuscan countryside. It's September 1944, and as they try to cross the Serchio River, the men are ambushed. The sequence has thunderous explosions, jittery editing, blown-up bodies -- everything but the virtuosity of staging that might have made the chaos and carnage revelatory instead of just a Saving Private Ryan rehash. Four members of the division end up stranded behind enemy lines, all but abandoned by a racist commander. In addition to Negron, there's Staff Sgt. Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke), a college-educated stoic devoted to his service; Sgt. Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy), furious at the world and a loose cannon, with no loyalty to the country he's fighting for; and Pvt. Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller), a starry-eyed oversize simpleton who rescues, and befriends, an Italian urchin (Matteo Sciabordi). The dramatic focal point, if you can call it that, is the war of wills between Stamps and Cummings. These two play out a version of the assimilate-versus-agitate debate that has echoed through many decades of African- American life, though this one would be more convincing if Ealy, a dynamic actor, had been asked to project his anger more in period, with a little less proto-gangsta recklessness. The men arrive at a picturesque village, where they mingle with the locals and Stamps and Cummings stoke their rivalry over Renata (Valentina Cervi), a married woman who is lovely in a saintly way. The film then veers into an endless, murky subplot about the Italian resistance from which it never recovers. ""Miracle at St. Anna"" wants to do too many things at once to do any of them with much verve. It aspires to be a war epic, but it's dominated less by combat than by flat, meandering talk. It wants to salute the flesh-and-blood valor of the Buffalo Soldiers, but these unsung heroes are treated as such impersonally symbolic and stiff-jointed types that their heroism shines only faintly. The movie tries to be raw and real, yet it isn't above trotting out a tyke who might have stepped out of Cinema Paradiso II to tag along with the soldiers as a mascot of sentiment. There are vile Nazis on hand -- and also a nice Nazi who does a really good deed. ""Miracle at St. Anna"" winds up as a pastiche of racial-historical correction, showboat atrocity, murder mystery, love story, and windy meditation. Is it any wonder that it's less than the sum of its ambitious parts? As odd as it may sound to say about a war film, though, the real trouble with ""Miracle"" is that Lee's filmmaking is joyless.

"(CNN) -- A California Sunday-school teacher accused of killing a young girl may have abducted another child, police said. Melissa Huckaby is charged with killing 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, who was a friend of her own daughter. Melissa Huckaby, 28, was arrested earlier this month and charged with killing and raping 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, who was taken from a mobile home park in Tracy, California. Police said Huckaby was named in a January police report about the four-hour disappearance of a 7-year-old girl from the same mobile home park, CNN affiliate KOVR reported. After Huckaby returned the girl, the girl had to be taken to a hospital because she was under the influence of a strong muscle relaxant.  Watch Nancy Grace for details » . Police were called to the mobile home park after the girl's mother reported her missing, according to KOVR. Police discovered that the girl was at a park with Huckaby. Huckaby said she had permission to take the girl, but the girl's family disputed that claim. About five hours after the girl was returned to her family, they discovered that she was under the influence of the drug. ""Her speech was slurred. She could barely walk. She could barely stand,"" the girl's older sister told KOVR. Police could not prove that Huckaby had drugged the girl and no arrest was made then. On April 11, Huckaby was arrested and charged with killing and raping Sandra Cantu. Huckaby -- a Sunday-school teacher who lives in the same mobile home park as Sandra's family -- has been charged with murder, kidnapping, the performance of a lewd and lascivious act on a child under 14, and rape by instrument. If convicted, she would face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, authorities said.","NEW: Melissa Huckaby named in police report on January missing girl case .

"(CNN)  -- The sagging economy is taking a bite out of federal school-meal subsidies as more students take advantage of free or low-price breakfasts and lunches, nutritionists say in a report released Thursday. About 425,000 more students are participating in the National School Lunch Program, a group reports. The School Nutrition Association surveyed more than 130 school nutrition directors from 38 states to produce its report, ""Saved by the Lunch Bell: As Economy Sinks, School Nutrition Program Participation Rises."" The nonprofit organization said that about 425,000 more students are participating in the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program in 2008-09 than in the previous school year. That represents an average increase of 2.5 percent from 2007-08, the report says. These numbers hold true despite a slight decline in the number of students enrolled in public schools this school year, according to the study. More than three-quarters of the districts surveyed reported a rise in the number of students eating free meals under the U.S. Department of Agriculture program, the report says. Many of the school district employees who monitor the food programs complain that the federal subsidies fall far short of the rising costs. According to the association, the estimated average cost to prepare a school meal is $2.90, but the federal reimbursement is $2.57. School lunch programs are experiencing a potential loss of at least $4.5 million per school day, based on 30 million school lunches provided, the group says. The good news, according to association President Katie Wilson, is that ""this year, when hunger is more common, more students are able to eat a balanced, nutritious meal at school."" Meals served under the USDA programs must meet nutrition guidelines based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. For lunches, that means no more than 30 percent of calories can come from fat and fewer than 10 percent from saturated fat.","Number of students eating subsidized meals rises 2.5 percent, nonprofit says .

"(CNN) -- Take a handful of screen goddesses and a clutch of matinee idols, put them together and one thing's sure to happen. Nobody does love like they do in the movies: this month on the Screening Room, we've picked our favorite silver-screen romantic moments. No contest: Bogie and Bergman in undoubtedly the silver screen's top romantic movie moment . From rom-coms to heartbreak, these are the scenes that skip the schmaltz to make us believe that sometimes, Cupid really does get it right. And, just for balance, we've also picked those moments that made us cringe -- or long for a sick-bucket ... Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Post your comments to the Screening Room blog and we'll publish the best. Read other CNN viewers' favorite romantic movie moments, and tell us yours >> . 1. Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) Yep, it's a no-brainer. In a world full of slushy, happily-ever-after rom-coms, Bogie and Bergman find true romance in heartache, sacrificing their romance for the greater good. Bogie's ""hill of beans"" speech still gets us every time. Oh, the tragedy! Still, they'll always have Paris ... 2. City Lights (Charles Chaplin, 1931) Truly, madly sweetly: Blind flower-girl Virginia Cherrill recognizes Chaplin's tramp when she presses a coin into his hand. Deeply moved, as the scale of his sacrifice dawns on her, she wells up -- as did we; his expression shifts from shame to tentative delight. The most touching film moment of all time? 3. Roman Holiday (William Wyler, 1953) Audrey Hepburn's princess falls for Gregory Peck's noble hack (surely that's an oxymoron!) -- but while the ending is bittersweet, it's the playful scene at the Mouth of Truth, with its pitch-perfect comic timing, that captured our hearts. 4. From Here to Eternity (Fred Zinnemann, 1953) ""Nobody ever kissed me the way you do."" Army sergeant Burt Lancaster and troubled wife Deborah Kerr find refuge in their torrid, adulterous affair; the heat between them is tangible. With the tumultuous waves crashing over the embracing couple, Zinnemann creates one of old Hollywood's most iconic images. 5. Amélie (Jean-Pierre Jeunet, 2001) A sheer moment of joy, as Amélie (Audrey Tautou) zooms through Paris on the back of Nino's (Mathieu Kassovitz) bicycle. The laughing couple freewheel down the cobbled streets past Sacré Coeur, filled with the delirious exuberance of new love. Ah, c'est l'amour. 6. Annie Hall (Woody Allen, 1977) The highlight of Woody Allen's confessional masterpiece is Annie's (Diane Keaton) first meeting with Alvy (Allen) at the tennis club where we're blown away by her vitality, ebullient charm and fresh contrast with Allen's wound-up, navel-gazing New Yorker. La-di-da, la-di-da, la la! 7. La Dolce Vita (Federico Fellini, 1960) Fellini's beautifully choreographed tableau in the Trevi Fountain sees young journalist Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni) rendered helpless as buxom screen goddess Sylvia (Anita Eckberg) draws him into her spell. A paean to those fleeting moments between sunset and dawn when reality slips away to reveal something altogether more magical. Talking of which ... 8. Before Sunrise (Richard Linklater, 1995) They've no time for mix-tapes, so Celine (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) head to a record store's music booth to acid-test their compatibility. In its confined space, they nervously avoid each other's eyes, so painfully aware of each other's physical presence. A moment that evokes strong memories of those sweet first-love connections. 9. Lost in Translation (Sofia Coppola, 2003) Bob (Bill Murray), a movie star well past his sell-by date, and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a neglected newlywed, are two lost souls who are cast adrift, and come together, in Tokyo. Their parting moment, when Bob whispers his secret farewell to Charlotte, is all the more romantic for its mystery. 10. When Harry Met Sally (Rob Reiner, 1989) Forget the orgasm scene in Katz's Deli. Forget the strolls in scenic Central Park. After ninety minutes of vacillating, Harry and Sally have one final bout of verbal sparring before they finally get it together for good. Now that's what we call New Year fireworks. ....................... And our most cringe-worthy moments... Four Weddings and a Funeral (Mike Newell, 1994) Out of the frying pan, into the fire: Hugh Grant escapes Bridezilla to pour his heart out to Andie MacDowell, who utters her painfully corn-dog response: ""Is it still raining? I hadn't noticed."" You could have had Kristin Scott Thomas, you dolt! Howard the Duck (Willard Huyck, 1986) Please, no! Down in B-movie hell, we hid our eyes and winced as lovely Lea Thompson attempted to seduce a rather startled duck-shaped alien. There should be laws against that sort of thing. Wait a minute, there ARE laws against that sort of thing! The English Patient (Anthony Mingella, 1996) ""I've watched you - on verandahs, at garden parties, at the races ... "" Ralph Fiennes turns stalker in Mingella's improbable mush-fest. And don't even start us on the bit where he runs across the desert. As Seinfeld's Elaine says, ""Quit telling your stupid story about the stupid desert and just die already! Die!"" Titanic (James Cameron, 1997) Timeless romance? We think not. As Leo slips away, Kate Winslet's star-crossed lover cries, ""I'll never let go, Jack. I promise."" And then does -- scurrying as quickly as her hands will paddle her to the safety of a lifeboat, a warm blanket and a nice cup of tea. Ah, the relief. Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones (George Lucas, 2002) ""I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.""

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Friends and acquaintances of Philip Markoff, a medical student accused of killing a woman he may have met through a Craigslist online ad, described the 23-year-old as a model student. Medical student Philip Markoff, 23, appears in court Tuesday in Boston, Massachusetts. ""My girlfriend actually rode the elevator with him a lot alone; it's kind of freaking her out now,"" said Patrick Sullivan, who lived in the same apartment building as Markoff in Quincy, Massachusetts, a Boston suburb. ""She thought he was kind of the all-American, good-looking guy,"" Sullivan said. ""When she saw him on TV yesterday, she even remarked, 'I can't believe it's him. I always thought he had such a great smile, and he was so nice to me.'"" James Kehoe, a friend of Markoff's from the State University of New York at Albany, where both attended college, said Markoff was ""one of the best students I've probably ever encountered."" ""He would never put anything in front of his work,"" he said. ""He had great aspirations to be a doctor."" Markoff, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, is charged with killing 26-year-old Julissa Brisman of New York on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel.  Watch acquaintances describe a smart, good-looking guy » . Markoff was arraigned Tuesday and is being held without bail. His attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is ""not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything."" A Boston University spokeswoman said the school suspended Markoff, who has no criminal record, when it learned of the charges on Monday. ""This was a brutal, vicious crime. Savage,"" Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley told reporters. ""And it shows that Philip Markoff is a man who's willing to take advantage of women -- to hurt them, to beat them, to rob them."" A procedural not-guilty plea was entered on Markoff's behalf, Conley said. Evidence from the scene suggests that Brisman ""put up a fight,"" prosecutor Jennifer Hickman said during the hearing Tuesday. Police have said that Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, a popular online classifieds service. She suffered blunt head trauma, Hickman said, and was shot three times at close range. One of the bullets passed through her heart, killing her, she said. Markoff is also charged in connection with the April 10 robbery of a woman at a Westin Hotel in Boston. In that case, the woman made arrangements to meet a man through Craigslist for a massage at the hotel, but was held at gunpoint and bound, Hickman said. She was robbed of $800 and personal items and left tied to a door handle with duct tape over her mouth, the prosecutor said in court Tuesday. The victim was not identified. Megan McAllister, who identified herself as Markoff's fiancee, maintained his innocence in an e-mail sent to ABC News. McAllister said Markoff ""is the wrong man"" and ""was set up."" ""Unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public,"" she wrote. ""All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!"" She accused Boston police of ""trying to make big bucks by selling this false story to the TV stations. What else is new??"" Authorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said. Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was killed showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, according to Boston police, who had sought public assistance in identifying the man. Police traced the Internet communications with Brisman to an e-mail account that had been opened the day before her death, Conley said. Using Internet provider information, they found the computer was at Markoff's residence in Quincy. Authorities put the home under surveillance, Conley said, and ""the case just begins to build from there."" Markoff, meanwhile, is ""bearing up,"" Salsberg said. ""It's obviously a difficult time for anybody in these circumstances with the charges that have been brought against him. ... He's pleaded not guilty. He is not guilty."" Authorities in Boston are working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, on what could be a related case. On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney said. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, McCartney said. He said the incident ""may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area,"" but that had not been determined. Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster told CNN the company is ""horrified and deeply saddened that our community services have been associated in any way whatsoever with a crime of violence."" He promised that Craigslist will evaluate the incident to see whether additional measures could be introduced to protect users.

"(CNN) -- The mysterious deaths of 21 prized polo horses Sunday at a club in Florida provides a peek inside the private world of a sport that generally is off limits to all but the very wealthy. The Lechuza Caracas polo team may not recover from the loss of 21 ponies for years, a polo executive says. The University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville and the state-run Kissimmee Diagnostic Laboratories near Orlando are conducting necropsies on the animals. Initial tests failed to reveal a cause, said Liz Compton, a representative of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Tissues, organ samples and blood are now being screened for toxic agents, she said. Scientists have ruled out any contagious disease because the animals died so quickly, said state Agriculture Department spokesman Mark Fagan. Authorities initially requested necropsies for only the eight horses that were insured, according to Sarah Carey, a representative of the veterinary school, which got the bodies of 15 horses. Later, the order was expanded to all 15 horses, she said. The U.S. Polo Association is among the parties cooperating in the investigation. ""In the meantime, we all mourn the loss of these horses,"" U.S. Polo Association Executive Director Peter Rizzo said in a news release. ""There are no words to describe the grief and sadness shared by everyone -- particularly the devastated owners of those magnificent horses.""  Watch what investigators are studying » . Players form strong emotional bonds with the horses they ride, said John Wash, operations president of the International Polo Club Palm Beach in Wellington, Florida, where the horses fell ill. ""I've heard a couple of polo players who were affected with this loss the other day, a couple of them I don't think have left their house since Sunday night,"" Wash said. ""There were a lot of tears there -- these big, tough guys just on their hands and knees, crying over what happened."" The U.S. Open Polo Championship that was interrupted by the tragedy will resume Wednesday with semifinal matches, Wash said. Lechuza Caracas, the team whose horses died, was offered spare mounts from other competitors so they could remain in the competition, but the devastated team chose to withdraw, Wash said. The Wellington tournament is one of the sport's three major championships, on a par with the U.S. Open in tennis or golf. Authorities say they believe that the competition facility is safe for the other horses and that whatever killed the 21 horses entered their bodies away from the site. Fifteen of the animals fell ill shortly before they were to compete Sunday; some died immediately and others lingered for almost an hour. Six others died overnight Sunday to Monday as they were kept in the same trailer in Wellington. Animals are not kept overnight at the competition site, so no special precautions are in place regarding food, water or bedding, Wash said. Organizers are planning a short memorial and laying of wreaths in honor of the horses, he said. Grief counselors are on hand at the facility to help employees deal with the trauma, Wash said. ""The scene can be described as almost like an airplane crash that involved not human life, but horses,"" he said. ""It was horrific."" Polo ponies in the United States are not drug-tested, but the U.S. Polo Association has been considering taking up the practice for several years, Wash said. ""People are calling for reform, and maybe that needs to happen, but until toxicology reports come back, and autopsy reports, we don't even know if [Sunday's incident is] anything related to that."" The Humane Society of the United States has no record of abuse of polo ponies, but that may be a function of the sport's exclusive nature, society spokeswoman Holly Hazard said. ""We are learning about this, as is everyone else,"" she said. ""It may be that perhaps because it's not televised or not as popular as other sports, it's not something that either our constituents or our program is particularly focused on. ""But if there are either performance-enhancing drugs or some problem that is associated with this, we will investigate and we will offer a reward to bring whoever is responsible to justice."" Keith Dane, director of the Humane Society's equine protection program, was en route to Florida on Tuesday to interview people involved in the incident and keep an eye on the investigation, Hazard said. No evidence has been brought forth suggesting someone deliberately poisoned the animals. ""I guess everything's possible,"" Wash said. ""I've heard all different rumors. I don't know if I even want to go there and think about that."" Compton, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services representative, said authorities have seen no evidence of criminal activity in the case. ""Clearly, law enforcement has gotten involved, given the complexity and the scope of the deaths, and they are fact-finding and gathering information, and once we have a specific cause of death, then they can determine where their investigation will go,"" she said. The devastated team, Lechuza Caracas, is one of the top teams in the world. The loss could set it back for years, Wash said. ""It's just like baseball or basketball or football,"" he said. ""You're taking years of grooming, training, nurturing to create, really, a first string of horses. And for four polo players, it takes anywhere from six to eight horses per polo player to play a game of polo. So if you're taking 21 horses, they're probably 21 of your first-string horses ... and you've just lost every one of your best players. ""It's not like you could just go out and buy 21 new horses and start at that point."" Polo ponies are thoroughbreds, many of them former racehorses retrained for the game, but they cover a wide range of ages, Wash said. When they get too old to play, they are retired to pasture or stud, he said. ""A polo horse is treated quite well,"" Wash said. ""In fact, when you're a polo horse, you might play three months here in Palm Beach, you might take three months off, you might play another three months, say, in Argentina or England, you take three months off. They're not pushed 12 months out of the year."" CNN's Kim Segal and John Couwels contributed to this report.","Investigators try to determine what killed 21 polo ponies in Florida .

"MARATHON, Florida (CNN)  -- Juan Lopez reads meters with one eye and looks for snakes with the other. Lopez is a member of the ""Python Patrol,"" a team of utility workers, wildlife officials, park rangers and police trying to keep Burmese pythons from gaining a foothold in the Florida Keys. Members of the Python Patrol show off a giant snake that stretched more than 20 feet. Officials say the pythons -- which can grow to 20 feet long and eat large animals whole -- are being ditched by pet owners in the Florida Everglades, threatening the region's endangered species and its ecosystem. ""Right now, we have our fingers crossed that they haven't come this far yet, but if they do, we are prepared,"" Lopez said. Burmese Pythons are rarely seen in the middle Florida Keys, where Lopez works. The Nature Conservancy wants to keep it that way.  Watch huge python wrap around a CNN reporter » . The Python Patrol program was started by Alison Higgins, the Nature Conservancy's Florida Keys conservation manager. She describes it as an ""early detection, rapid response"" program made up of professionals who work outside. Eight Burmese pythons have been found in the Keys. ""If we can keep them from spreading and breeding, then we're that much more ahead of the problem,"" Higgins said. Utility workers, wildlife officials and police officers recently attended a three-hour class about capturing the enormously large snakes. Lt. Jeffrey L. Fobb of the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Venom Response Unit taught the participants how to capture pythons. ""There's no immutable laws of snake catching. It's what works,"" Fobb said as he demonstrated catching a snake with hooks, bags, blankets and his hands. ""We're doing it in the Florida Keys because we have a lot to protect,"" Higgins said. ""The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures, and we want to make sure they don't breed here."" Where the snakes are breeding is just north of the Keys in Everglades National Park. An estimated 30,000 Burmese pythons live in the park. The Everglades, known as the ""River of Grass,"" is a vast area with a climate perfect for these pythons to hide and breed. And breed they do: The largest clutches of eggs found in the Everglades have numbered up to 83. The snakes grow like they're on steroids. With a life span of 30 years, these pythons can weigh as much as 200 pounds. And the larger the snake, the bigger the prey. Biologists have found endangered wood rats, birds, bobcats and other animals in their stomachs. Two 5-foot-long alligators were found in the stomachs of Burmese pythons that were caught and necropsied, officials say. Officials also say Burmese pythons can travel 1.6 miles a day by land, and they can swim to reach areas outside the Everglades. This nonvenomous species was brought into the United States from Southeast Asia. Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar says biologists believe that well-intended pet owners are to blame for their introduction into the Everglades. ""These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,"" she said. Higgins says 99,000 of the popular pets were brought into the United States from 1996 to 2006, the most recent data available. She says they are an easy species to breed, and you can buy a hatchling for as little as $20. The problem with these pets, Friar says, is that they get too big for their owners to handle. Making the owner aware of what to expect when the animal becomes full-grown is a priority. ""The pet trade is pretty supportive in educating people,"" Friar said. She hopes a ""Don't let it loose"" message campaign makes an impact on pet owners. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, a supporter of restoring the Everglades, has introduced a bill that would ban importing the python species into the United States. The senator saw the need after learning about the effect these snakes were having on the park. ""Finding out many endangered species are being found in the stomach of the python,"" Nelson spokeswoman Susie Quinn said, ""we need to do a better job at protecting the resources."" In the meantime, Lopez and the Python Patrol will continue to protect the Florida Keys by capturing the snakes and turning them over to biologists to perform necropsies. The Nature Conservancy plans to expand the program to all the areas that surround the Everglades, making these predators their prey.

"ROOSEVELT, New York (CNN)  -- Lisa Brown was caught off-guard by the offers of help that came from strangers. Lisa Brown has to move out of her rental house because it fell into foreclosure and was sold at auction. ""I'm overwhelmed,"" she said. ""People helping people in these tough times. I never meant to solicit any help. This is incredible, really."" Brown and her three daughters can't escape eviction. The family is being kicked out of a rental house because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the home fell into foreclosure. The house was sold at auction, and they have to move out by May 1. She didn't seek financial help, but it came anyway. An executive from Texas named Kelvin who saw Brown's story on CNN.com was moved by her ""unfortunate situation"" and wanted to help. He sent a check for $400. A New York man named Dave offered financial help as well as aid planning for the future. When Brown moved into the Long Island, New York, home last summer, she loved the spaciousness she never had in an apartment. ""It was bigger than what I had lived in,"" she said. Brown was also won over by the neighborhood, with its tidy homes and good schools. ""I wanted to come here, and I wanted to see my kids graduate from this school district."" The bad news came just seven months after she moved in. A real estate broker came to the door and handed her an eviction notice, telling her she had to vacate. ""I was hysterical. I was like, 'What do you mean?' ""  Watch Lisa Brown talk about why she has to move » . The broker explained that the landlord no longer owned the property and the lease was no longer valid. Brown had no idea the house was in foreclosure. As a tenant, she always paid her rent on time, and she assumed the mortgage was being paid. ""I didn't see there was a problem,"" she said. ""You know, I'm paying rent, and she's putting it toward her mortgage."" Brown was astonished to learn that her landlord, who lives upstairs, rented the house when she knew that she was losing it. ""She knew that this house was foreclosing on her. She did nothing about it,"" Brown said. ""Nothing except take my money."" Brown had been paying $1,900 a month in rent. She had also paid $5,700 for a security deposit and broker fees to secure the house. That money, she said, is gone. ""She will not give me my deposit back. Nothing."" CNN tried to reach the owner for comment about the security fee, but no one answered the door, and the phone is disconnected. The broker who rented Brown the house and who was paid $1,900 said he didn't know that the house was in foreclosure. He also said the brokerage fee will not be returned. Dave, who lives on Long Island and who also read Brown's story on CNN.com, was perplexed that none of the fees were being refunded. To help recoup her losses, Dave offered help and sent a check for $5,000. Helping with Brown's immediate needs was not enough for Dave, a financial adviser who wanted to do something for her future. ""He offered me a retirement plan,"" Brown said. ""He came to my job, gave me his business card and said, 'I want you to get into this plan; I will help you with this.' "" Dave met Brown over coffee and set her up with a retirement account, something the 42-year-old said she has never had. He will make monthly contributions of $500 for 10 consecutive months to get her started. But Brown still has one problem: She has to move out. She has no legal right to stay. The bank that foreclosed on the house and owns it has offered her $1,000 to vacate. Brown's problem is not unique. Nearly 20 percent of all foreclosures are on rental properties, and tenants' rights in such situations are minimal, according to the Center for Housing Policy, a nonprofit organization that researches housing issues. In most states, when a bank forecloses on a landlord, the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property, and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure. So while the owners know what is going on, renters are usually kept in the dark. New York state Sen. Jeff Klein is aware that renters can run into problems. ""In many instances, they're actually paying their rent on time, and the owner of the property who is in foreclosure is pocketing the money,"" he said. Klein said that 50 percent of all foreclosures in New York involve rental properties, and he is working on a law to warn tenants of foreclosure proceedings ahead of time, to keep them from losing their security deposits and being evicted with nowhere to go. Similar laws are in place in California, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Rhode Island. ""What we're facing here,"" Klein said, ""it's sort of the new homeless population unless we do something about it."" His legislation is scheduled for a vote next week. Responding to the outpouring of help Brown has received, Klein said, ""It's great support for the Brown family, but that's why we need legislation for innocent, hardworking people like Lisa to protect them from reaching the point of desperation. People who play by the rules should not be penalized for the misdeeds and malice of others."" Brown hopes to relocate in the same area so her daughters can stay in the schools they love and be near their friends. A caseworker for the Children's Aid Society, which administers the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund for the victims of the subprime mortgage crisis, saw Brown's story on CNN's ""American Morning."" They are now in contact so the fund can help cover moving and transitional expenses. Brown may have to adjust some of her dreams, but she is optimistic. She said the one thing she has seen through this experience is ""the goodness of the human spirit is alive, and that's encouraging.""","Lisa Brown is being evicted because landlord defaulted on mortgage .

"(CNN)  -- A 47-year-old woman who became paralyzed after breaking her neck and back on a turbulent flight is developing some motion in her toes and regaining some sensation after two operations, her doctor said Wednesday. Dr. Trey Fulp, an orthopedic spine surgeon who performed the surgeries at McAllen Medical Center in McAllen, Texas, told CNN that the woman initially was paralyzed from the chest down. She underwent six hours of surgery Saturday and a more than five-hour operation late Tuesday, the surgeon said. ""She is very brave and is talking,"" Fulp said. ""If she walks again, I get the first dance."" The woman was on Continental Flight 511 en route from Houston, Texas, to McAllen early Saturday, a one-hour trip that had been delayed more than three hours because of severe storms that barreled through the Houston area on Friday night. The woman's attorney, Ramon Garcia, said Tuesday that his client struck her head on the bathroom ceiling when the plane suddenly dropped during turbulence. ""We have a lady who got out of her seat and went to the bathroom,"" Garcia said. ""And while either in the bathroom or coming out of the bathroom is when this situation occurred."" The woman was stretched out on the plane's floor for the remainder of the flight until paramedics could start treating her, the attorney said. Fulp said another physician was on the flight. When that doctor realized the woman couldn't get up, he held her until the flight landed 20 minutes later. Garcia said his client, a mother of three, did not want to be identified. Continental spokeswoman Mary Clark on Tuesday confirmed that the flight -- carrying 104 passengers and five crew members -- experienced turbulence and that two passengers and a crew member were transported to a hospital in McAllen. Clark said one passenger and the crew member were released, but the other passenger remains hospitalized. ""Our focus is assisting the customer who is still in hospital and her family,"" Clark said. Seat belt lights were illuminated during the turbulence, the spokeswoman said. However, it's not clear whether the passenger was already out of her seat when the light came on or whether she ignored the light and got up to go to the bathroom. Federal aviation authorities are investigating. The Federal Aviation Administration said it's providing crucial flight information to the National Transportation Safety Board.

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- A U.N. report says hunger is on the rise globally and blames higher food prices. Populations within conflict zones such as the Democratic Republic of Congo are particularly vulnerable. The Food and Agriculture Organization has issued preliminary estimates classifying 963 million people as undernourished -- an increase of 40 million people over the past year. ""One out of seven people -- about 15 percent -- suffer chronically of not having enough to eat,"" said Mark Smulders, an FAO economist. The hunger report -- titled ""The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008"" -- said the world's financial and economic problems could throw more people into poverty. The number of hungry had been increasing over the years before the rise in food prices, with warfare and political instability continuing to be among the factors causing poverty. The preliminary estimates lack a firm country breakdown, but last year's figures are an accurate measure of where the problems are. About 907 out of 923 million undernourished people in 2007, or 65 percent of the hungry, live in India, China, the war-wracked Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Ethiopia. Smulders said about 27 percent of the world's hungry live in India and 15 percent in China. The other countries each represent 4 to 5 percent of the world's total. There has been progress in fighting hunger in the Asian nations of Thailand and Vietnam, and in the sub-Saharan African nations of Ghana, Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Mozambique and Malawi, the report said. Food prices have declined from their peak earlier in the year, but they are staying high compared to other years, the agency said. The Food and Agriculture Organization's food price index was 28 percent higher in October than it was two years before. ""Prices of major cereals have fallen by over 50 percent from their peaks earlier in 2008 but they remain high compared to previous years,"" the FAO said. The agency said the ""rural and urban poor, landless farmers and female-headed households are the worst hit by high food prices."" -- CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","U.N. agency says food prices are to blame for an increase in hunger .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The home life Diana Krall shares with husband (and fellow musical brain) Elvis Costello and their 2-year-old twin boys is a little nutty. Diana Krall's new album, ""Quiet Nights,"" was inspired by a trip she made to Brazil. ""It's zany in the most wonderful way,"" says the 44-year-old jazz singer-pianist. ""You have two little boys leaping off the furniture who think they're Buzz Lightyear while we're practicing and playing. It's just a happy house."" Krall's domestic bliss -- ""domestic"" being a new concept for the ever-touring artist -- is suggested in the warm, intimate vibe of her latest album ""Quiet Nights."" ""It's a very natural process for me, making a record. It ends up being a reflection of where I am at that time. My life is just tremendous right now. It couldn't be better,"" she says. No kidding. ""Quiet Nights"" debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 album charts last week, a career high for Krall. A memorable trip to Brazil in 2007 inspired the Canadian chanteuse to take her 12th album in a bossa nova direction: The title track is the English version of the bossa nova classic ""Corcovado."" She also covers ""The Girl from Ipanema"" -- though naturally in her whispery rendition she flips ""girl"" to ""boy"" -- and gives a fresh spin on Frank Sinatra's ""Where or When.""  Watch Krall find bliss in Brazil » . ""There was something about turning 'Where or When' into a bossa nova that changes the feeling for me of the song,"" Krall said. ""It's much more emotional than if I sang it in a swing feeling. I've always experimented with that."" Krall brought arranger and conductor Claus Ogerman on board. He was a natural, having worked with Sinatra and Brazilian singer-songwriter Antonio Carlos Jobim who wrote both ""Ipanema"" and ""Corcovado."" And Krall co-produced the album with frequent collaborator Tommy LiPuma. ""One of the best parts of making a record is the dinner after where you all you go to the restaurant, you decompress, have some great wine and just tell stories and listen to Claus and Tommy and [engineer] Al Schmidt and all these people telling amazing stories,"" says Krall. Diana Krall recently sat down with CNN to share some stories of her own about a teenaged letter to Oscar Peterson, idolizing Harry Connick Jr. and Mickey Mouse pancakes. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: This is the first album you've made since becoming a mother. Does it feel different somehow? Diana Krall: I think [this album reflects my present] state of mind. It's not about loss, it's not preparing for loss. I'm not peeling grapes. Life has changed a lot and it's not just about performing and touring. It's motherhood and having a home for the first time, because I've always been on the road. So it's an incredible thing to be making Mickey Mouse pancakes in the morning while you're doing your interviews. CNN: You've been producing Barbara Streisand's new album. What has that been like? Krall: Incredible. I just am so thrilled with her performance on this album. [She gives] one of the most incredible performances I think of her career on a song called ""You Must Believe in Spring"" with a great pianist from New York named Phil Charlap. It's just piano and voice and it's so incredibly stunning. She said to me, ""Maybe it needs some strings or something."" I said ""Don't touch it! Just leave it! It's gorgeous!"" It's been great working artist to artist and we had a lot of fun. We played cards. So when there were moments in the studio where there was something technical that had to be fixed, we'd deal the cards and we'd play gin rummy, which I'm lousy at. Thank goodness. CNN: This is the first album you've produced for another artist. Way to choose somebody really small to start off with. Krall: She chose me! I had a few phone calls and it was a little daunting, but it was a great experience and really, really intense, as you would expect it to be. CNN: Some people were a little put out by your record ""The Girl in the Other Room"" because you strayed from jazz. How did you process that reaction? Krall: Somebody's always put out with anything I do (laughs). ""Why'd you do 'The Look of Love?' "" ""Why don't you do 'The Look of Love' again?"" I don't know! I'm too busy trying to put the Lego back in the box, and making sure nobody's eating all the Play-Doh. That record did very well and a lot of people say to me, ""That's my favorite record."" And I wrote [it] with my husband, so I don't really look back. I look forward. And I've got a pretty loyal audience. CNN: What would you say to your sons if they tell you they want to be musicians when they grow up? Krall: They should do whatever makes them happy. This is what they know so if that's what they choose to do -- who knows. They could be like my mom and my dad and be a teacher-librarian and a chartered accountant. That's fine too. A month ago I found this letter I wrote to Oscar Peterson when I was 16 years old and my mom had saved it for me and put it in a box in the attic. It was a five-page letter I wrote to Oscar Peterson saying, ""Dear Oscar, I'm 16 years old and I hear a professional musician's life is a very difficult one but I know this is the only life I want to have."" And it was really enlightening for me to see the focus of a 16-year-old. It reminded me of how much I love the music and always wanted to do what I'm doing, so how lucky am I? CNN: But it's not all luck. Krall: I think it's a lot of luck. I think I started in a very good time. When I went to see that film ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and I heard Harry Connick playing the piano, I though there's somebody who's my age and he's playing the music that I love. And I felt like there was a kindred spirit and it inspired me to go, ""I want to do exactly what he's doing."" And I still owe a lot of thanks to Harry. I've only met him like a couple of times, but he's still a favorite artist of mine.","Diana Krall's new album, ""Quiet Nights,"" features bossa nova interpretations .

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- More than one million people in Darfur are at risk of losing food, water and shelter in coming months, following the expulsion of international aid groups by Sudan's government, the United Nations' chief humanitarian coordinator said Tuesday. A Doctors without Borders medic helps a sick child in a Darfur refugee camp. The statement by coordinator John Holmes comes after a joint U.N.-Sudanese assessment of the situation. The information was gathered from March 11-18 in hopes of stemming further troubles in Darfur after Sudan's government expelled 13 international relief organizations from the wartorn region. The announcement came on the same day that President Omar al-Bashir, now an indicted war criminal, ignored the threat of arrest by traveling abroad to Eritrea. Also Tuesday, a Sudanese staffer working for a Canadian relief group was shot dead in Darfur. A full report of the assessment will be released soon, according to the U.N., but an executive summary and recommendations were made available on Tuesday. ""While a significant effort is being made by the government, by the U.N., by the NGOs [nongovernmental organizations] which are left, to plug some of the immediate gaps in these areas, these are at the same time, 'Band-Aid' solutions, not long term solutions,"" Holmes said. The U.N. estimates that 1.5 million people in Darfur are dependent on healthcare support, 1.1 million need regular food aid, and another 1 million are in need of clean drinking water. The summary released Tuesday said the World Food Programme, which is still allowed to operate in Sudan, is carrying out a one-time-only distribution program in March and April, but that new partners will be needed to continue delivering food after April. After the International Criminal Court charged Bashir with war crimes and crimes against humanity on March 4, Khartoum expelled 13 international aid agencies and revoked the permits of three organizations in the country. Bashir -- the first sitting head of state to be charged with war crimes by the court -- has continued to say that humanitarian efforts in the country should be ""Sudanized."" ""Within a year, we don't want to see any foreign aid group dealing with a Sudanese citizen,"" he said at a rally a week after his arrest warrant was issued. Holmes said that 13,000 to 14,000 aid workers in the region already were Sudanese nationals. Holmes said the cooperation and technical help from the Sudanese government on the assessment was a good step forward. But he called it ""only the first of many steps if the people in Darfur are not going to suffer major consequences from these expulsions."" Sudan's U.N. Ambassador, Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad, has repeatedly said he has information implicating the ousted organizations in activities contrary to their humanitarian missions. He has yet to make any of that information public. One claim is that some organizations acted as spies for the International Criminal Court. Holmes denied those allegations, saying they remain unfounded. ""Despite claims that there are dossiers of evidence, we have not been given any of that evidence,"" he said. ""In the absence of that, no meaningful investigation can be done."" The British aid organization, Oxfam, one of the agencies expelled from Sudan, released a statement in response to Tuesday's findings. ""Current stop-gap measures will only be effective for a short time,"" the statement said. ""As the rainy season arrives within the next two months, people living in weak temporary shelters, in flood-prone locations where latrines can fill and overflow, will become at extreme risk of disease and death. ""With the humanitarian capacity reduced by nearly 50 percent, responding to such emergency scenarios will be an enormous challenge for others to tackle,"" Oxfam said.","Assessment of humanitarian needs in Darfur conducted by UN and Sudan .

"(CNN) -- The cause of a South Carolina wildfire that has charred about 19,600 acres appears to be a yard debris fire, the head of the state's Forestry Commission said Friday. Derek Boos sifts through the wreckage of his in-laws' house Friday after a fire in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The blaze seems to have been caused by a yard debris fire in the Woodlawn subdivision, an unincorporated part of Horry County, halfway between Conway and North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina Forestry Commission Forest Protection Chief Darryl Jones said. The fire began Saturday and rekindled itself Wednesday evening, according to the Forestry Commission. Officials said about 70 homes had been destroyed in the county, which contains a stretch of popular tourist spots, including Myrtle Beach. About 100 other homes were damaged, Horry County officials said. The blaze left only charred rubble and the smoldering, skeletal remains of some houses, even as adjacent homes went untouched. The fire swallowed up pines and dry brush, sending a smoky gray smudge into the sky that could be seen for hours from miles away Thursday. ""It's better now, but the smoke was pretty much everywhere,"" said Chavdar Pavlov, a CNN iReport contributor who lives 20 miles from where the fires raged. ""At nighttime, it was like snow in the air, but it wasn't snow; it was ashes."" The Horry County Council's Brent Schultz said, ""The only way to describe this is tragic."" At a Friday morning news conference, frustrated residents who had evacuated demanded to know when they could return home, yelling at Bob Grabowski of the Horry County Council. ""I just want to go home,"" one man cried out, prompting Grabowski to pause. ""Come on,"" others said. ""That will be addressed,"" he said. ""We'll get with you on that."" About 2,500 people were evacuated Thursday, authorities said, and more than 400 people were in shelters. No fatalities or injuries have been reported from the blaze. Horry County said the fire was about 40 percent contained by early Friday.  Watch as residents face uncertainty about their houses » . ""It's on everybody's mind and in everyone's conversation,"" said the Rev. Marion Brazell, whose Conway church was serving as a shelter. ""It's pretty flat area, so you can see the smoke from a distance."" Brazell had not yet arrived at the church Friday, but he said he believed only Red Cross and other emergency workers were staying there. The evacuations occurred north of Conway, he said. He added good-naturedly, ""Shelters are often the last place people will go. They'll go to hotels and motels"" that may offer rooms for free. ""I'd rather go to a motel than sleep in my church. ... It's much more comfortable than sleeping in a cot,"" he said. The fire has mostly kept its distance from tourist areas, and as the South Carolina officials provided updates and warnings to residents, they urged visitors to stay. ""For tourists coming here for vacation, we should have no problems taking care of our guests and visitors that are going to come to Myrtle Beach and North Myrtle Beach,"" Grabowski said. And North Myrtle Beach Mayor Marilyn Hatley, answering a question about tourism, said Thursday: ""People who have reservations can certainly come onto the Grand Strand area and enjoy themselves. It is not affecting the majority of golf courses; there should be no reason that anyone is canceling their vacation."" Hatley said she could not say if any golf courses had been damaged. ""The golf course property itself was not our first priority,"" she said.

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian emergency officials have begun evacuating 800 families from an area at high risk from the expected eruption of a volcano that killed at least six people in November. Colombians make their way across a landslide in November after the Nevado del Huila volcano erupted. The Nevado del Huila volcano is on orange alert, meaning an eruption is probable within days or weeks, the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining said last week. An eruption would cause an avalanche down the Paez and Simbola rivers, officials said. The town under evacuation, Belalcazar, sits on the bank of the Paez River about a half-mile (less than a kilometer) from the junction with the Simbola River. It was the worst-hit area in November's eruption. The volcano's crater holds 52 million cubic meters (1.8 billion cubic feet) of lava, said Colombia's Caracol Radio. That's the equivalent of 13.8 billion gallons. The Colombian national emergency agency said Monday it is ready to evacuate thousands of residents if the volcano's condition turns to red, which means an eruption is imminent or ongoing. The snow-capped Huila, the highest active volcano in Colombia, last erupted on November 20. At least six people, including four children, died then. Gas and hot ash caused snow on the mountain peak to melt, sending mud, rocks and floodwater rushing down the Paez and destroying at least 20 homes and washing out five bridges, the presidential office said at the time. Much of the sparsely populated region about 155 miles (250 kilometers) southwest of Bogota is a reservation for Nasa indigenous communities. All six fatalities were native Indians, the government said. The youngest victim was a year old. The Huila volcano, which has a summit of 17,598 feet (5,364 meters), has erupted four times. The first documented eruption occurred in the 1500s, then it stood silent for more than 400 years, according to the Web site volcanolive.com. Colombian emergency officials said Monday they are asking the 800 families where they want to be moved to, Caracol Radio said. Scientists with the Colombian Institute of Geology and Mining, commonly known as Ingeominas, said they did not detect any major action inside the volcano Monday, Caracol reported. Ingeominas and the National System for Emergencies are monitoring the volcano around the clock and have acquired new equipment, including additional telecommunication gear and an infrared camera to monitor Huila's temperature. Officials also plan to install a microphone on Huila to detect any new rumblings from inside the volcano, Caracol said. Officials already are monitoring the volcano with four stations that detect seismological activity, a video camera, a communications network and a system that measures mudflow, Caracol said.","Eruption likely within days or weeks at Nevado del Huila volcano, agency warns .

"(CNN)  -- Security forces aboard a U.S. naval vessel fired warning shots toward two approaching small boats off the Somali coast Tuesday, the U.S. military said Wednesday. The USNS John Lenthall is one of 14 fleet refueling ships operated by Military Sealift Command. The rounds landed in the water, prompting the boats to turn around, and no casualties were reported, the military news release said. It is unclear whether the boats were trying to attack the 41,000-ton USNS John Lenthall, the military said. ""It is clear they were not following the international rules of the road observed by mariners around the globe,"" it said. The release noted that the location of the incident, the types of boats involved and the maneuvering were all ""consistent with reports from previous attacks on merchant vessels in the region."" The USNS John Lenthall is one of 14 ""fleet replenishment oilers"" in the Military Sealift Fleet Support Command, according to a U.S. Navy Web site. Oilers refuel Navy ships at sea and any aircraft they may be carrying. Attacks by pirates have increased dramatically off the northern coast of  Somalia in the past year, prompting the United States and other nations to step up patrols in the region. In May, the U.S. Navy warned merchant ships to stay at least 200 miles off the Somali coast. But the U.S. Maritime Administration warns that pirates sometimes issue false distress calls to lure ships closer to shore. The pirates are often armed with automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rockets, according to warnings from the agency.","Warning shots fired after two boats raise suspicions of piracy .

"(CNN) -- Somalia is facing life-threatening food and water shortages leaving millions at risk for starvation, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Wednesday. A growing percentage of Somalia's population has become dependent on humanitarian aid. ""The Somali people are going through unbearable hardship,"" said Pascal Hundt, head of the ICRC's delegation for Somalia, in a written statement. ""We are witnessing the worst tragedy of the past decade in Somalia."" Somalia's last severe famine, from 1991 to 1993, devastated crops, killed between 240,000 and 280,000 people and displaced up to 2 million, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Humanitarian workers view Somalia's food crisis as one of the worst in the world. With winds ripping though the country, hundreds of thousands of Somalis are finding their crops as dry as the surrounding landscape, preventing harvests, killing livestock and leading to a mass risk of starvation. The continual armed conflicts in central and south Somalia have aggravated the situation, hindering people from accessing shelter and medical attention. A growing percentage of the population has become dependent on humanitarian aid. The ICRC, World Food Program and CARE plan to deliver four months worth of food to 435,000 Somalis within the next few weeks. International donors are being asked by the ICRC to provide some of the emergency money. Aid includes giving blankets, kitchen sets and other shelter supplies to 150,000 people. The WFP will be increasing the amount it spends in Somalia to $163 million in food assistance, the group said at a U.N. conference in Rome Wednesday. In addition to drought and armed conflict, high inflation on food and fuel have also exacerbated the situation. Similar factors have affected other developing nations in Africa and other parts of the world. Ethiopia's food crisis has affected 4.5 million people, said the United Nations Children's Fund. As a result of widespread food shortages and little rainfall, an estimated 126,000 children are in need of medical assistance to combat severe malnutrition, while the WFP projects $193 million will be needed for urgent food distributions.","ICRC: Somalia facing life-threatening food, water shortages leaving millions at risk .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged businessman Robert Allen Stanford with orchestrating an $8 billion fraudulent investment program. Stanford presents a trophy to the winners of his Twenty20 cricket tournament in November 2008. Stanford is the tycoon who bankrolled the Twenty20 Super Series cricket competition in the West Indies last year. The Texan has also contributed millions of dollars to the West Indies Cricket Board in an attempt to boost their flagging fortunes. Rose Romero, Regional Director of the SEC's Fort Worth Regional Office in Texas, said, ""We are alleging a fraud of shocking magnitude that has spread its tentacles throughout the world."" Stanford allegedly fabricated historical return data to prey on investors. The SEC says the investigation is on-going. Reuters.com reports three of Stanford's companies are involved in the SEC probe including Texas-based Stanford Group Co, Antigua-based Stanford International Bank and investment adviser Stanford Capital Management. The SEC Web site said Stanford International Bank CFO James Davis and Stanford Financial Group chief investment officer Laura Pendergest-Holt also face charges. It added that U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor granted a temporary restraining order freezing the defendants' assets and appointed a receiver to marshal those assets, as part of a request for emergency relief for the benefit of defrauded investors. The SEC's complaint alleges that the fraud centered on a program in which Stanford International Bank promised ""improbable and unsubstantiated high interest rates."" SIB allegedly acted through a network of Stanford Group Company financial advisers to sell approximately $8 billion of ""certificates of deposit"" to investors. The bank boasted a unique investment strategy that it said allowed it to receive double-digit returns on its investments for the past 15 years, the SEC said. Early Tuesday, CNBC reported federal marshals were seen entering the offices of Stanford Financial Group in Houston. Reuters reported an eyewitness saw a sign taped to the window stating the company is now ""under the management of a receiver."" Stanford Financial Group could not immediately be reached for comment. According to the SEC's complaint, a close circle of Stanford's family and friends operates SIB. Its investment committee, responsible for managing the bank's multi-billion dollar portfolio of assets, includes Stanford; Stanford's father, who lives in Mexia, Texas; another Mexia resident with business experience in cattle ranching and car sales; Pendergest-Holt, who had no financial or securities experience prior to joining SFG; and Davis, Stanford's college roommate. The SEC alleges an additional scheme relating to $1.2 billion in sales. Stanford Group Company advisers are accused of using materially false historical performance data to create a mutual fund program called Stanford Allocation Strategy, the release said. According to the complaint, the false data helped grow the program from less than $10 million in 2004 to more than $1 billion, generating SGC - and ultimately, Stanford - about $25 million in 2007 and 2008. In the UK, the Press Association news agency reported that the England and Wales Cricket Board has ceased negotiations with Stanford, who was expected to become a major backer of a proposed tournament in England from 2010.","Robert Allen Stanford charged in alleged multi-billion dollar fraud .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Cell phone images are providing evidence that a large number of civilians may have been mistakenly killed by U.S. troops operating in Afghanistan last month, two NATO officials said Sunday. The grainy cell phone video shows blankets and quilts covering bodies inside a building. The Afghan government, a United Nations review and other reports from the region state that as many as 90 civilians were killed in an August 22 airstrike, but the Pentagon has adamantly disputed the death toll. Another U.S. military official, who has seen the cell phone imagery but asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media, said Monday there were about 30 bodies, some covered and some in blankets. There were ""several children who appear to be pulled from the rubble,"" he said. The grainy cell phone video, viewed by CNN, shows rows of blankets and quilts inside a building. In the video, someone lifts the blankets to show the heads of those slain. People who appear to be mourners sit by their loved ones and wail.  Watch: Video prompts Pentagon probe » . Though CNN has confirmed the military is reviewing the video, CNN has not independently verified the authenticity of the imagery. The U.S. military source, who has direct knowledge of the investigation, said the initial U.S. assessment was based largely on comparisons of satellite imagery of a 10-square-kilometer area from before the attack, taken August 14, and imagery captured after the attack, on August 24. Officials viewing the satellite imagery looked for fresh graves after the attack and found only 18 new plots, just in the village area, he said. A U.S. patrol then went to the area August 26. The patrol confirmed those graves but found no others, the source said. The cell phone images were recently shown to Gen. David McKiernan, the top NATO commander, who over the weekend asked for a high-level review of the previous military investigation. That probe concluded the United States was only responsible for a handful of civilian deaths. One of the NATO officials said it appears there were a number of villagers buried in the rubble that the U.S. troops did not see when they were searching the compound targeted in the airstrike. It is believed that after the U.S. troops left the compound, villagers pulled the bodies from the rubble and buried them. Locals apparently took cell phone images and showed them to U.N. investigators, who recently showed them to McKiernan, leading him to request a review. McKiernan learned of the cell phone imagery only after it was shown to him at the U.N. headquarters in Kabul a few days ago. ""In light of emerging evidence pertaining to civilian casualties in the August 22 counter-insurgency operation in the Shindand District, Herat province, I feel it is prudent to request that U.S. Central Command send a general officer to review the U.S. investigation and its findings with respect to this new evidence,"" McKiernan said Sunday in statement. ""The people of Afghanistan have our commitment to get to the truth,"" he said. Afghanistan's government and the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan concluded that 90 civilians were killed in the August 22 airstrike in the western Afghan province of Herat. UNAMA said it found ""convincing"" evidence that 60 children, 15 women and 15 men were killed in the strike. But the initial investigation by the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan found that 30 to 35 Taliban militants and five to seven civilians were killed. The findings have been handed over to McKiernan. After the Afghan government concluded its investigation, ministers demanded a review of international troops within its borders. On August 25, Afghanistan's Council of Ministers called on the Defense and Foreign Affairs ministries to start negotiating a ""status of forces"" agreement with international forces -- which include U.S. and NATO troops. The council also asked that the ministries demand the international forces halt airstrikes on civilian targets, as well as house searches not coordinated with Afghan authorities and the illegal detention of civilians. That same day, Afghan President Hamid Karzai announced that he had fired two military commanders, including Gen. Jalandar Shah, the Afghan army corps' commander for western Afghanistan. The humanitarian watchdog group Human Rights Watch released a report Monday saying that U.S. and NATO airstrikes in Afghanistan almost tripled from 2006 to 2007, ""fueling a public backlash."" The report added that this year, there has been a ""massive and unprecedented surge in the use of airpower"" there. Karzai has blamed U.S.-led coalition forces for failing to coordinate their attack with the Afghan army. However, coalition officials said Afghan and coalition troops called in the airstrike as they embarked on a raid to arrest a Taliban commander in Shindand. The coalition investigation found that U.S. and Afghan forces began taking fire from Taliban militants as the forces approached the target in the early hours of August 22. ""The intensity of the enemy fire justified use of well-aimed small-arms fire and close-air support to defend the combined force,"" the coalition said in a statement released shortly after the strike. ""The type and application of fires were used in accordance with existing rules of engagement."" Mullah Sadiq, a known Taliban commander, was among the militants killed, the coalition said. A U.S. military official, who declined to be named because the investigation is ongoing, cast doubt on reports that the strike killed civilians gathered in a room, reciting Quranic verses at 1 a.m. Regarding reports that most of the 90 deaths were children, the official said there were not 50 children in the entire village. The airstrike was on a legitimate target, he said, noting that coalition forces found a weapons cache -- including AK-47s, 4,000 rounds of ammunition and bomb-making materials -- as well as thousands of dollars in U.S. currency. Investigators also discovered ""firm evidence"" that militants had planned to attack a nearby coalition base, the coalition statement said. The airstrike disrupted the militants' plan, the statement said. The investigating officer interviewed more than 30 people, both Afghan and American, the statement said. He also viewed video taken during the engagement, topographic photos of the area before and after, reports from ground and air personnel involved, reports from local medical clinics and hospitals, intelligence reports, and physical data and photographs collected on the site. Last week, Karzai spoke to President Bush ""in general terms"" about the incident, the White House said in a statement. It gave no further details.","NEW: Video shows rows of blankets, apparent mourners wailing by loved ones .

"(CNN) -- Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland. Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. ""I very quickly realized two things,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. ""One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change."" ""The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening."" He calls his discovery Warming Island. Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming. Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious. The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius). The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling. The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC. The presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. ""For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it,"" Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. ""A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming,"" he added. Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union. But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves,"" he said. ""When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming."" He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal. ""The Earth is always getting colder and warmer,"" he said. ""It's always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet."" Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained. ""We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred,"" he said. ""What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming."" Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. ""We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don't predict it,"" he said. ""We don't know what's going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty."" The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations. The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers. Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them. ""Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know,"" Schneider said. ""That it's going to warm up? I'd bet anything on that.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- To this day, Linda Haywood recalls the shame she once felt for her great-uncle. Jack Johnson was convicted of transporting a white woman across state lines for ""immoral purposes."" ""I could see from the expression on my mother's face that it pained her to tell me about him,"" she recalled, ""but it wasn't just her. The shame was there for all the members of my family."" Haywood's great-uncle, Jack Johnson, shocked the nation in 1908 by becoming the first African-American world heavyweight champion. Yet the boxer was arrested not long afterward for taking a white woman across state lines for ""immoral"" purposes. That case fell apart and the woman later became his wife, but then investigators charged him with a similar offense involving a woman he had dated years earlier. An all-white jury's decision to convict him in that case has come to be widely viewed as a symbol of racial injustice. Now Haywood is working with Sen. John McCain and others to try to clear her great-uncle's name. McCain wants the Senate to pass a resolution urging President Obama to grant Johnson a presidential pardon. It would represent a final vindication for Haywood, a 53-year-old seamstress in Chicago who now views her great-uncle with pride. Her parents didn't tell her until she was 12 that she was related to Johnson, even though she saw his photo at school during lessons on black history. ""I remember seeing his picture on the wall of my sixth-grade classroom in Chicago in 1966,"" Haywood said in a voice tinged with sadness. ""It was up there next to pictures of Sojourner Truth and George Washington Carver as part of a black history week my teacher put together. I didn't have the first clue who the man was. My parents didn't want me to know."" Her parents, she said, were trying to protect her from a legacy of racial injustice at a time when the country had yet to emerge from the long shadow of segregation. Haywood was stunned when she learned her great-uncle's story. Less than five years after winning the heavyweight title, Johnson was convicted for violating the Mann Act, which outlawed the transportation of women across state lines for ""immoral"" purposes. Johnson was black and the woman was white -- enough to get even a champion imprisoned in early 20th century America. Justice Department lawyers decried it as a ""crime against nature"" for him to have a sexual relationship with a white woman. Judge Kennesaw Mountain Landis, later to become the first commissioner of Major League Baseball, set Johnson's bail at $30,000 -- the equivalent of more than $660,000 today. When a bail bondsman showed up, Landis jailed him, too, according to an account that filmmaker Ken Burns relays in his documentary, ""Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson."" An all-white jury convicted Johnson in less than two hours. ""Mr. Johnson was perhaps persecuted as an individual, but ... it was his misfortune to be the foremost example of the evil in permitting the intermarriage of whites and blacks,"" one of the prosecutors later said. Johnson's real crime, in the eyes of many, was committed three years earlier, when he successfully defended his boxing title against Jim Jeffries, a white boxer who came to be called the ""Great White Hope"" because many white fans saw him as the best chance to wrest back a boxing title from the African-American champ. Jeffries, a former heavyweight champion, had come out of retirement intending to reclaim a title that many Americans believed Johnson had no right to in the first place. Johnson beat Jeffries on July 4, 1910, before a stunned, almost entirely white crowd in Reno, Nevada. Race riots followed. More than 20 people were killed and hundreds were injured. Most victims were black. So when they ""couldn't beat him in the ring, the white power establishment decided to beat him in the courts,"" Burns said in his documentary. Johnson fled to Europe in 1913 while free on appeal. But after years of fights overseas -- including the eventual loss of his title in Havana, Cuba, in 1915 -- Johnson came home. He turned himself over to U.S. authorities at the Mexican border in 1920 and served ten months in prison. He died in a car wreck in 1946. ""Back then, if you were black and you were told that you did something wrong, you really had no recourse,"" said Haywood. ""You just accepted what was done because black people were basically powerless and voiceless. Jack may have been a rich boxer, but he couldn't fight the system."" Today, in a very different America, Haywood's family is seeking justice. They've teamed up with Burns, McCain and Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, to urge the nation's first African-American president to grant Johnson a rare posthumous pardon. McCain and King introduced resolutions calling for a presidential pardon in 2005 and last year. The House passed it, but the Senate did not. The White House declined to comment when asked Obama's views on a possible pardon for Johnson. McCain, who says he made a mistake by once voting against a federal holiday for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., sees the pardon as a way to right an old wrong. ""The Jack Johnson case is an ignominious stain on our nation's history,"" he said on the Senate floor this month, while introducing a new version of the resolution. ""Rectifying this injustice is long overdue. [The resolution recognizes] the unjustness of what transpired, and sheds light on the achievements of an athlete who was forced into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice. Johnson ... deserved much better than a racially motivated conviction."" King, himself a former boxer, said in a written statement that Johnson was a trailblazer who became ""a victim of the times."" For Haywood, the proposed pardon is also personal. It's about wiping the slate clean for future generations of her family. ""My mother used to say Jack was defiant,"" she remembered. ""No disrespect, momma, but he was being his own man. And I'm so proud of him. To think -- of all the families in the world, God gave him to us."" Haywood has made sure her four children know the story of the country's first black heavyweight champion. ""They love him,"" she said. ""Especially my oldest son. He was a bit of a pugilist in high school. He got into his fair share of scraps. I think we know where he got that trait."" Haywood says she'll go to Washington if Obama issues a pardon. With a bit of laughter, she promises to give a gracious, eloquent speech thanking him. With or without a pardon, she emphasizes, the stigma and the shame are gone. Today, Johnson's family feels only pride.","Heavyweight champ Jack Johnson was arrested around 1908 .

"(CNN)  -- Workers at a Texas state school for mentally handicapped adults are believed to have been staging a ""fight club"" among residents, encouraging them to physically battle one another, police told CNN Tuesday. A cell phone containing videos of the alleged abuse at the Corpus Christi State School in Corpus Christi, Texas, was turned over to police last week, and authorities are expecting to file arrest warrants this week, Corpus Christi police Capt. Tim Wilson told CNN. The incidents are believed to have taken place in a school dormitory, Wilson said. ""This has been going on for some time,"" Wilson said. ""That is what makes this an exceptional case. It is not the workers abusing the clients, so to speak. The workers are not hitting them, but they are allowing these clients to fight with each other, thereby endangering their well-being."" ""These people are charged with the care and custody of these clients, and they are exploiting (them),"" he said. Those involved will likely face charges of injury of a disabled person, Wilson said. The charge's severity can range up to a third-class felony, depending on the extent of a person's involvement, he said. The actual charges, however are left up to the Nueces County District Attorney, which is participating in the investigation along with the Texas Inspector General's Office, he said. Seven school employees have been placed on paid emergency leave by the Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services, according to spokeswoman Cecilia Fedorov. Some former workers also will be interviewed, authorities said. Fedorov said the agency received a phone call Friday from the state Department of Family and Protective Services, saying they had been alerted to the situation by police and were opening an investigation into possible abuse or neglect. The employees on leave cannot come on to campus, but must sign in at the gate every day they are on leave, Fedorov said. State officials are awaiting the outcome of the investigation to determine whether they should take further action, she said. Wilson said Corpus Christi police received the cell phone a week ago, when a citizen found it and gave it to an officer working security at a hospital. The officer looked at several of the videos, then gave the phone to the police's forensic unit for analysis. More videos were found in the phone's memory. ""It appears it was some sort of a fight club,"" Wilson said. Twenty videos were found on the phone, with dates going back about a year. All the videos featured the school's ""clients,"" who are severely mentally handicapped, he said. On the videos, ""they (the clients) are not upset like they are being forced,"" Wilson said. ""They are being more goaded into it. There's a lot of voices on there from workers ... saying, 'Look at that, ha ha' ... laughing, stuff like that."" No clients are seen crying, upset or injured on the videos, he said, but no workers are seen stopping the fighting. ""The fighting entails pushing, wrestling and some shoving,"" Wilson said. Police do not believe anyone was seriously injured, he said, but the investigation is ongoing. ""Four or five clients have been identified and at least five workers, possibly as many as 10,"" he said. ""Some are more active in staging the fights, and some others passively stand around not doing anything."" The clients are all adult males, ranging in age from their late teens into their 30s, he said. As part of the investigation, the Inspector General's office has interviewed some of the clients, Wilson said. Asked whether the school had previously been investigated for abuse, he said, ""This is the exception. Over the years, we have had isolated instances of abuse we have investigated. Every once in a while, the school itself would report a case, but this appears to be organized."" Police believe, based on the videos, the ""fight club"" was confined to one dormitory, he said. CNN's John Murgatroyd contributed to this report.","Cell phone videos of alleged abuse at Corpus Christi State School given to police .

"This story is part of an ongoing series of profiles by CNN about economic survival in this time of financial crisis. Jean Lindsay records a video telling people to get out of their nightgowns and look for work. (CNN) -- Jean Lindsay, a spunky 67-year-old with two masters' degrees, panicked after she failed to land a job in the garden center of a Lowe's home-improvement store. She started to wonder whether a woman of her age ever would be able to find work. She worried about her debt, and weeks of unemployment were turning into months. After the job interview, she stayed up most of the night in the fits of an anxiety attack -- vomiting and huddling under the bedcovers with her two dogs. ""God, I felt like I was falling off the ends of the earth,"" she said. A few days later, though, she tossed on a red sweater, plopped down in front of her computer, flipped on her Web camera -- and, suddenly, while streaming her story onto the Internet, things seemed OK. ""I know I can count on you to send me great letters of support and cheer,"" Lindsay told viewers on CNN's iReport.com. ""And remember, if you're going through this, I'm going through it too. There are lots of us going through this."" Watch Lindsay's post . For Lindsay, like many people these days, the Internet has become both a tool for economic recovery and a cure for isolation. iReport.com: Share your survivor story . At a time when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says that 1.07 million people 55 and older are unemployed and looking for work, the Internet is an increasingly useful tool for older people looking for jobs and a sense of community, said Deborah Russell the AARP's director of workforce issues. ""It's a great way of being able to network with people who are either in a similar situation or who may have some resources to help you,"" she said. The number of people who need this help is on the rise. Some older people are delaying retirement because of the economic recession; and, according to an analysis by the AARP Public Policy Institute, those who are looking for work typically search for about a third longer than people younger than 55.  Watch how one senior goes back to school for a living » . Lindsay had been out of work for about three months before her brother gave her a Web camera for Christmas last year. Almost immediately, she was hooked. Her brother intended her to use the Web cam mostly to communicate with family members who are spread out across the country, she said. But Lindsay didn't stop there. She got a creative jolt from filming quirky videos of her own. So, she started posting video monologues for the Internet world to see. In the past three weeks, she's posted nearly 40 videos on iReport. Her most popular video -- in which she talks about depression while wearing a plaid nightgown -- has been viewed by more than 140,000 people. ""I was in my nightgown at noon, and I wasn't getting at the job search very fast, and I thought, 'this is instructive,' "" she said, laughing. She signs off from the video simply: ""Get up, and get out!"" Watch Lindsay's tips for getting out of the house . Her own advice compelled her to do the same. Lindsay says sharing her failures as well as successes online is cathartic, but she also hopes it's helpful for people in similar circumstances. She's not shy about saying that she suffers from mild bipolar disorder. This economy can push people into depression and mental illness, she said, and she wants people to know they're not alone. The same goes for her job search. ""This has really invigorated me,"" she said of her forays with a virtual persona. ""It's something where I've had success. And the job search is not always successful -- it's dealing with a lot of rejection, especially when you're older."" On iReport, Lindsay posts under the name ""infoaddict,"" which seems fitting for a former librarian and information technology expert with masters' degrees in literature and library information sciences. Like a good book, Lindsay says the Internet also opens new worlds for her. While she's not sure exactly how, she has a sense that all of her online storytelling will help her in the job search. If nothing else, the online videos market her computer skills, she said. Dan Beach, Lindsay's second cousin, who lives in Florida, said Skype, social media sites and online video have been ""a salvation"" for Lindsay. ""Frankly, I think she was very, very depressed. And I think this has brought her out enormously,"" he said. The 72-year-old added: ""It helps an older person feel younger because there is so much youth [online]. I've done the Facebook thing in the past couple of months myself."" At first, Lindsay's online presence surprised him. ""She's gotten so much response to it, and I'm wondering whether she might try to make something out of that,"" he said. ""She's just the dotty aunt enough to be able to do that kind of thing. She's a charming person."" iReport.com: Send us your job hunt stories . Lindsay, who said she needs a job because she has home-improvement debt and can't sell her house in this slumped market, said she is able to keep hunting for jobs partly because of her creative outlet online. She grew up loving to help her grandfather on his farm. Together, they would build manure loaders and chicken pluckers -- machines Lindsay found fascinating. Those experiences translated into her love for hardware stores, gardening and gadgetry. ""I love hardware stores, so Lowe's would have been perfect. I'm just a crazy old lady, I've just got catholic taste,"" she said. But she believes that something better than Lowe's is out there. She plans to apply to an office-supply store, an electronics store and for a telecommunications job she could do from her home in western New York. ""There is a real Catch-22 for people my age who are still hale and hearty and still have some talent left. We're probably fooling ourselves that we can go on and do anything,"" she said, ""but we can't live that way.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- For the fifth time this year, a U.S. Air Force nuclear weapons unit failed an inspection, this time because of failure to document its handling of nuclear missiles and other critical issues, Air Force officials said. In an Air Force file photo, an airman inspects a missile part at a training site. A ""nuclear surety inspection"" and ""unit compliance inspection"" was conducted this month on the 90th Missile Wing at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming by an Air Force inspector general. There was no risk to the unit's Minuteman III nuclear missiles, Air Force officials said. The unit has 90 days to correct the problems and pass another inspection. In the wake of recent problems, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and top Air Force officials have indicated a zero tolerance for failing inspections, but no punishments are expected in this case, officials said. The inspection report found the maintenance unit failed to document tests conducted on missiles correctly, including tests on safety devices. The inspector general told the unit the failures indicated either a ""lack of competence"" or ""disregard for procedures,"" according to a source who has seen the report. Additionally, failures included having some personnel on duty without proper medical clearance and failure to inspect radiation detectors. Other units that failed inspections this year included two bomb wings and two missile units.","Unit at Wyoming base fails to document missile handling, Air Force officials say .

"(CNN) -- Pulitzer Prize-winning author, radio host and activist Studs Terkel died in his Chicago, Illinois, home Friday at the age of 96. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Studs Terkel died at his home Friday at the age of 96. Terkel had grown frail since the publication last year of his memoir, ""Touch and Go,"" said Gordon Mayer, vice president of the Community Media Workshop, which Terkel had supported. ""I'm still in touch, but I'm ready to go,"" he said last year at his last public appearance with the workshop, a nonprofit that recognizes Chicago reporters who take risks in covering the city. ""My dad led a long, full, eventful -- sometimes tempestuous -- satisfying life,"" his son Dan said in a statement. ""The last time I saw him, he was up, about, and mad as hell about the Cubs,"" workshop President Thom Clark said in the statement.

Terkel was born in New York but moved to Chicago, where his parents ran a small hotel. Terkel would sit in the hotel lobby watching droves of people arguing, fighting, ranting and telling stories. ""That hotel was far more of an education to me than the University of Chicago was,"" Studs told CNN in 2000. It seems that beginning would pave the way for Terkel's love of passing on people's oral histories. He could often be found behind a tape recorder talking to the people who would eventually become the basis for his books. Terkel became famous, if not synonymous with oral histories, for his ability to cast a light on the working class. ""Oral history preceded the written word,"" Terkel told CNN in 2000. ""Oral history is having people tell their own stories and bringing it forth. ""That's what history's about: the oral history of the unknowns that make the wheel go 'round. And that's what I'm interested in."" In an interview with Lou Waters on CNN in 1995, Terkel spoke about his book ""Coming of Age,"" which explored the lives of people who have been ""scrappers"" all of their lives. Inside the book are the stories of people between the ages of 70 and 95, a group he called ""the truth tellers."" ""Who are the best historians? Who are the storytellers?"" Terkel asked. ""Who lived through the Great Depression of the '30s, World War II that changed the whole psyche and map of the world, a Cold War, Joe McCarthy, Vietnam, the '60s, that's so often put down today and I think was an exhilarating and hopeful period, and, of course, the computer and technology. Who are the best ones to tell the story? Those who've borne witness to it. And they're our storytellers.""

"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida (CNN)  -- A bat that apparently had trouble flying instead tried to hitch a ride on the space shuttle Discovery, NASA officials said. The free tail bat was last seen clinging to the space shuttle Discovery's external fuel tank just before launch. The animal was last seen clinging on the foam of the external tank of the space shuttle moments before the Discovery launched, officials said. NASA officials had hoped the bat would fly away on its own, but admitted the bat probably died quickly during Discovery's climb into orbit. Discovery's seven-member crew, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center on Sunday, is on a 14-day mission to deliver supplies needed to expand the International Space Station. NASA officials noticed the bat before shuttle's liftoff and brought in a wildlife expert to look at video images of it. The expert said it appeared to be a free-tailed bat that probably had a broken left wing and an injured right shoulder or wrist. The launch pads at the space center are near the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, so NASA has sirens to scare away animals that get near the shuttles. The bat isn't the first to try hitching a ride into space. NASA officials said they noticed one of the creatures on a tank of a shuttle in 1998. That bat flew away as the shuttle's massive engines ignited. The crew of the Discovery safely docked at the International Space Station on Tuesday. It was unclear whether its stowaway was still clinging to the shuttle.","NASA: Bat was last seen clinging on space shuttle Discovery before launch .

"Editor's note: Randall Balmer, an Episcopal priest, is professor of American religious history at Barnard College, Columbia University, and a visiting professor at Emory University. His most recent book is ""God in the White House: How Faith Shaped the Presidency from John F. Kennedy to George W. Bush."" Randall Balmer supports Obama's unusual broadening of a president's words to include nonbelievers. NEW YORK (CNN) -- President Obama's mention of ""nonbelievers"" in his inaugural address represents an important broadening of the circle of acceptability in American life, an acknowledgement of our growing diversity and a fuller embrace of the principles articulated in our nation's charter documents. One of the hallmarks of American life, dating to the 17th century, is its religious pluralism. The Atlantic seaboard during the colonial period was home to everyone from Puritans, Roman Catholics and Dutch Reformed to Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, Swedish Lutherans, Anglicans, Huguenots, Mennonites and Schwenckfelders. Jews arrived in New Amsterdam in 1654, refugees from South America after the Portuguese takeover of Recifé. Somehow it all worked, especially in the crucible of religious pluralism in the Middle Colonies: New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, where William Penn launched his ""Holy Experiment"" of religious toleration. In the context of the New World, these religious groups learned to coexist with remarkably little conflict, and when it came time to configure the new nation, the founders in their wisdom elected not to designate any group as the state religion. ""Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,"" the First Amendment to the United States Constitution reads. This provision set up a kind of free market for religion in America, allowing religious groups to compete in a marketplace unfettered by government interference. Indeed, American history is littered with religious entrepreneurs (to extend the economic metaphor) who have peddled their wares in this marketplace and thereby contributed to the vigor and vitality of American religious life. The story of religion in America life has been one of expansion and ever-increasing diversity. Although Roman Catholics were present in the colonial period -- Maryland, named for the wife of Charles I, was founded by Catholics from England -- Catholics arrived in great numbers from Ireland, Germany and Italy over the course of the 19th century. Many Protestants, their hegemony threatened, resisted, sometimes with violence. Jews from Germany and Eastern Europe came as well. Most of the resistance was episodic. With notable -- albeit unfortunate -- exceptions, we Americans eventually rise to our better selves and embrace the principles of equality and toleration enshrined in our charter documents. And we can trace these changes in our rhetoric. The term ""Judeo-Christian,"" although coined late in the 19th century, became popular in the 1930s as the clouds of war were gathering in Europe. In 1955, after World War II, when so many sons of Jewish and Catholic immigrants fought the Axis powers, sociologist Will Herberg published a book entitled ""Protestant-Catholic-Jew,"" arguing that any of these religious expressions was legitimately ""American."" The following decade saw still more changes. The civil rights struggle brought the vibrancy of African-American religious life to national attention, and Lyndon Johnson's signature on the Hart-Cellar Immigration Act in 1965 removed immigration quotas. In the decades since, the arrival of people from around the world, especially from South Asia and Southeast Asia, has literally recast the religious landscape of the United States. Muslim mosques, Hindu temples, Sikh Gurdwäräs and Buddhist stupas have sprouted across the nation, from cities to the countryside. And our rhetoric has evolved as well. Whereas America might once have been described as a ""Protestant"" nation and then a ""Christian"" nation (to reflect the inclusion of Roman Catholics), we moved to ""Judeo-Christian"" and then ""Protestant-Catholic-Jew."" More recently, we have talked about the ""Abrahamic Traditions,"" Jews, Christians and Muslims, thereby broadening the circle to include Islam, one of the three major monotheistic religions. Even with this broadening landscape, however, presidents have generally acknowledged only believers and failed to mention atheists or agnostics. Our rhetoric, in fact, has always lagged behind our reality. When President Obama declared, ""We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus and nonbelievers,"" he sent a signal that it's time, once again, to enlarge the circle of inclusiveness, consistent with the great American tradition of equality and toleration. Although I'm sure that Buddhists and Jains and Sikhs and countless other religious adherents would like to have been included in the president's roll call, the message was clear: We are a diverse nation, and the ""free exercise"" of religion guaranteed in the First Amendment also protects the exercise of no religion at all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Randall Balmer.","Randall Balmer: It's unusual for a president to include nonbelievers in his words .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The two youngest stars in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" will get ""a substantial sum of money"" that would ""change their lives for the better"" when they turn 18, but only if they stay in school, director Danny Boyle told CNN. Director Danny Boyle says the youngest actors in his film will get ""substantial"" money if they stay in school. Rubina Ali and Azharuddin Ismail, both 8, have been temporarily forced to stay away from school by the crush of journalists who have converged on the campus in Mumbai, Boyle said. ""The press attention that's been focused on them is really sad at the moment and they've had to leave school temporarily because the press outside the school is disrupting the school,"" Boyle said. ""So, we've withdrawn them from the school for a short while."" Boyle, in a CNN interview Thursday, said the boys were paid ""way over and above what you could pay,"" despite media reports to the contrary. The success of the moderately budgeted film, about an orphan seeking fame and love through the ""Millionaire"" game show, drew a spotlight to the slums of Mumbai, India, where it was filmed. A controversy erupted this week when the children's parents told reporters they felt they were exploited and underpaid for their work. The Telegraph newspaper of London reported the children and their families still live in the same ""tangle of makeshift shacks"" in Mumbai where they lived when the casting director found them. Azharuddin's situation has gotten worse, the paper said, because ""his family's illegal hut was demolished by the local authorities and he now sleeps under a sheet of plastic tarpaulin with his father, who suffers from tuberculosis."" This public relations challenge began just as Oscar ballots were mailed to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is nominated for 10 Oscars, including best picture and best director for Boyle. Boyle defended how his production company has treated the boys. ""We thought long and hard about how best can we benefit them and we decided to put in place an education plan for them,"" Boyle said. ""We put them in school, a very good school, which they're paid for to stay in until they're 18."" ""If they stay in school until they're 18, a substantial sum of money is released to them then, which will effectively change their lives for the better,"" Boyle said. The Telegraph quoted their parents saying Azharuddin was paid less than $2,500, and that Rubina got about $700. ""The children were paid well,"" Boyle said. ""The families were paid well for their work, over and above what you could pay, way over and above what you could pay."" ""Some of the figures that have been quoted have been very inaccurate,"" Boyle said. He said he would not quote the real numbers ""because to do so makes them vulnerable within their own community. There are people who would take advantage of them immediately."" Even the trust fund is a target of ""gangsters,"" he said. ""The money that would be released to them when they are older, that is the kind of thing that can be mortgaged off by gangsters,"" he said. Boyle said the film's financial backers have agreed that charitable groups that help children of the slums will also see ""a slice of the profits."" ""We've all agreed that we will sit down and dedicate a slice of the profits of the film to be distributed amongst people like those who run the school and other organizations who make a big difference to children's lives there,"" he said. ""We gained from the city, both from these two children and from the city, in general, and we'll make sure the film gives back some of the enormous success it's had,"" he said. -- CNN's Kareen Wynter contributed to this report.","The children's parents say they felt they were exploited and underpaid for their work .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN)  -- The only surviving suspect in last month's attacks in Mumbai has written a letter to the Pakistan High Commission, or embassy, seeking legal aid, CNN's sister network in India reported Saturday, quoting a Mumbai police official. Flames and smoke gush from the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai, India, on November 27. Investigators said that Mohammad Ajmal Kasab is from Faridkot village in the Okara district of Pakistan's Punjab province and that the other nine attackers also are from Pakistan. Pakistani officials have denied that assertion, blaming instead ""stateless actors."" Rakesh Maria, Mumbai's joint police commissioner of crime, said Saturday that Kasab's three-page letter was written in Urdu. In the letter, Kasab confesses his role in the attacks, CNN-IBN said. The letter is to be delivered to the commission's New Delhi, India, office, possibly Monday, the network reported. Maria paraphrased parts of the letter at a news conference but did not release a copy to the media, CNN-IBN said. More than 160 people were killed in the three-day Mumbai siege that started November 26 and targeted 10 sites, including two luxury hotels, a train station and other landmarks. Of the 10 suspects, only 21-year-old Kasab survived, according to police. This week, Pakistani authorities banned a charity linked to the attacks and placed its leader under house arrest, Pakistan's information minister told CNN. The move came after the U.N. Security Council designated the charity, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, as a terrorist organization because of its links to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (known by the acronym LeT) and placed sanctions on the group. India has blamed LeT for training the attackers who carried out the Mumbai attacks.","Mohammad Ajmal Kasab is only surviving suspect in last month's attacks .

"(CNN) -- The world has certainly changed since Michael Jackson last staged a concert tour in 1997 to promote the ""HIStory"" album. Fans clamor in London as Michael Jackson announces his return to performing. Since then, other performers have gained prominence -- some who have even been tagged as heir-apparents to Jackson, such as Usher and the currently legally troubled Chris Brown. Now the original is back. Jackson announced Thursday that he'll perform 10 concerts in London in July. But is the world ready to receive Jackson, who has had his share of financial and legal woes, with open arms?  Watch Jackson make his announcement » . Publicist and writer Howard Bragman said it's up to the public. ""He's playing off the fact that people have the wonderful ability to have short memories,"" Bragman said. It was only a few years ago that Jackson was acquitted of several charges, including child molestation, in a California trial. The case, coupled with the singer's eccentric behavior, had seriously damaged his reputation.  See a timeline of Jackson's life » . Bragman said Jackson, who is slated to play the 20,000-capacity O2 Arena, is better off playing smaller venues rather than booking huge stadiums that may not sell out, an embarrassment a returning veteran can't afford to risk. ""It's sort of like the political thing, how you always want to get a small room and make it look full,"" Bragman said. ""Have reasonably priced tickets and do some of your classics. I certainly think that at one point there were tens of millions of Michael Jackson fans worldwide and I think there have to be still some Michael Jackson fans."" Culture critic, filmmaker and former Billboard music editor Nelson George said British fans are much more forgiving of Jackson's troubles than are Americans, who expect celebrities to be ""saints and heroes,"" George said. ""The love for Michael Jackson in the UK is undiluted by any of the stuff that's been talked about here in the states,"" said George, whose soon-to-be-released book ""City Kid: A Writer's Memoir of Ghetto Life and Post-Soul Success"" offers some insight into the era in which Jackson's popularity exploded. ""He's a huge star there still and he will sell out all of those shows,"" George added. George recently returned from London, where he witnessed firsthand the adoration that European fans have for the singer. While there, he said he attended ""Thriller,"" a sold-out tribute to Jackson in London's West End. George points out that Jackson is pursing a similar path to the one the musical artist Prince took in 2007 when he played 21 nights at the O2 Arena. Given its London location, George observed the venue has the potential to attract fans from across Europe. Moreover, George said, the British have long been admirers of black music and culture. ""It's the perfect place for [Jackson] to play,"" George said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- From Capitol Hill to Springfield, Illinois, President Obama and Congress paid tribute Thursday to Abraham Lincoln on the bicentennial of his birth. Visitors greet an Abraham Lincoln impersonator in Washington on Thursday. ""It is an honor to be here: a place where Lincoln served, was inaugurated, and where the nation he saved bid him a last farewell,"" Obama said at the Capitol on Thursday. ""As we mark the bicentennial of our 16th president's birth, I cannot claim to know as much about his life and works as many who are also speaking today, but I can say that I feel a special gratitude to this singular figure who in so many ways made my own story possible -- and who in so many ways made America's story possible."" White House officials say Obama's speechwriter had several conversations with historian Doris Kearns Goodwin in crafting the speech. ""At a moment when we are far less divided than in Lincoln's day but when we are once again debating the critical issues of our time -- and debating them sometimes fiercely -- let us remember that we are doing so as servants of the same flag, as representatives of the same people and as stakeholders in a common future. That is the most fitting tribute we can pay and the most lasting monument we can build to that most remarkable of men, Abraham Lincoln,"" Obama said.  Watch more on the Lincoln celebration taking place » . Obama will also speak later Thursday at an event in Springfield. Throughout the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama -- a Democrat who hails from the Land of Lincoln -- reminded audiences from coast to coast about the similarities between himself and the beloved political leader. At his presidential acceptance speech in Chicago, Illinois, on November 4, Obama used Lincoln as a guide for his ideology. ""As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, 'We are not enemies but friends. ... Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection,' "" Obama said.  Watch a young student read one of Lincoln's speeches » . In Washington, a congressional tribute took place at the Capitol rotunda. Illinois senior Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat, gave the keynote address. At the end, a wreath was placed at the Capitol. The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield also opened its doors Thursday for a special celebration, featuring original documents including the Gettysburg Address.  Watch CNN's Kyra Phillips take a tour » . Meanwhile, the Library of Congress marks the bicentennial Thursday by opening a special exhibit featuring Lincoln's handwritten speeches and artifacts, including the Bible used last month by Obama during his swearing-in. ""This exhibit, in a little more than 200 items, presents Lincoln, the man and the politician,"" said John Sellers, curator of the exhibit, which runs through May 9. Lincoln successfully fought a proposal for legalized slavery as development spread to the Western United States, and he eventually brought an end to slavery throughout the country. Among the manuscripts on display is a letter he wrote in impassioned defense of his Emancipation Proclamation.  Watch actor Sam Waterson's reading of Lincoln speeches » . The librarian of Congress, James Billington, acknowledges that the materials are available on the Internet in ""digitized"" form, but he said ""there is something about seeing the original because, after all, Lincoln was a man of words, of rare eloquences."" ""His words changed history,"" Billington said. The exhibit at the Library of Congress -- on Capitol Hill next to the U.S. Supreme Court -- was in the works for Lincoln's bicentennial long before the presidential campaign in which voters elected Obama. Billington said the exhibition is all the more profound as visitors explore the links between the anti-slavery Lincoln and the African-American Obama. There are also grim reminders of Lincoln's assassination. An original ""wanted"" poster with large black letters reads: ""$100,000 Reward. The murderer is still at large."" The poster includes a photograph of John Wilkes Booth, who was on the run after being accused of firing the fatal shots at Ford's Theatre in Washington, where Lincoln was attending a play. ""This is the autopsy report,"" Sellers noted during the preview. ""Those are actual blood stains -- Lincoln's blood."" Other, more lighthearted artifacts are also on display, including an 1860 letter from a girl urging presidential candidate Lincoln to grow a beard to help his prospects with voters.

"(CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board said Wednesday that both engines of the US Airways flight that ditched last month into the Hudson River contained bird remains. The feather found inside one of the engines of the plane that crashed into the Hudson River. The engines from US Airways Flight 1549 were sent to the manufacturer in Cincinnati, Ohio, where the NTSB directed the analysis, it said in a news release. The plane's flight data recorder ""revealed no anomalies or malfunctions in either engine up to the point where the captain reported a bird strike, after which there was an uncommanded loss of thrust in both engines,"" the NTSB said. The NTSB also said that an ""engine surge event"" in the right engine on January 13, two days before the accident, was caused by a faulty temperature sensor, which had been replaced. Investigators said last month they found a single feather and evidence of ""soft-body impact damage"" on the aircraft. The find reinforces the pilot's report that the plane was brought down by a flock of birds. Pilot Chesley B. ""Sully"" Sullenberger, 58, told investigators his aircraft struck birds, disabling both engines, about 90 seconds after takeoff from LaGuardia Airport in New York. The feather, found on a flap track on the wing, was also sent to identification experts at the Smithsonian Institution last month. The pilot ditched the Airbus A320 in the Hudson River and passengers tried to flee the aircraft almost immediately after it settled in the water and began to float along the river current. All 155 crew members and passengers on the plane survived the incident, which New York Gov. David Paterson dubbed a ""miracle on the Hudson.""","Engines sent to manufacturer in Ohio after crash .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Court hearings began Friday for 11 people, including two Spanish professional football players and a Serb-French football agent, who were arrested this week on charges of cocaine smuggling, a police source told CNN. Spanish police allege the group smuggled the drugs in from Argentina. The 11 are accused of taking advantage of their football contacts in Latin America, and their trips to the region, to organize the drug trafficking. Spanish police made the arrests on Thursday, mainly in Madrid, and seized 600 kilos (1,320 pounds) of cocaine they alleged had been shipped from Argentina to Spain earlier this month. The suspected leader of the group was identified as Zoran Matijevic, a Serb-born football agent, the international football federation, who now holds French citizenship, according to a police statement and the police source. His aides in the alleged scheme included Pedrag Stankovic, a former player on the second-division Hercules team from Alicante in southeast Spain; Carlos de la Vega Diaz, a current player for the second-division Rayo Vallecano team in Madrid, and Pablo Acosta, a football agent, according to the statement and the police source. The investigation began in the middle of 2008 after police began to notice a group running drugs from South America to Spain. A container with 45 packages of cocaine -- linked to the suspects -- was hidden in wind farm machinery. It left an Argentine port in February, stopped in Tangiers, Morocco and then crossed the Strait of Gibraltar, docking in the southern Spanish port of Algeciras. The cocaine container was finally driven by truck to Madrid, but before the suspects could get the cocaine and distribute it, the police moved in, arresting seven suspects in Madrid, three in the southeast port of Valencia and another in Alicante. The suspects include a Peruvian national, the police statement said. Authorities say Spain --- with its extensive coastline on the Atlantic and the Mediterranean -- is a major point of entry for drugs, for use in Spain or to be shipped elsewhere in the European Union.","Two professional footballers and agent among 11 accused of drug smuggling .

"(CNN) -- An Internet auction to sell off the plaster cast that New Zealand Prime Minister John Key wore when he broke his right arm has raised close to NZ$ 20,000 for charity. John Key wears the cast during a TV interview on Friday. The online auction ended Sunday with a winning bid of NZ$18,500 (US$ 9,362), according to the New Zealand shopping Web site TradeMe, which conducted the bidding. The prime minister broke his arm in two places on January 17 when he tripped on some stairs at a Chinese New Year event in Auckland. Later, during a trip to Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands for a Pacific Islands Forum meeting, several dignitaries -- including Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd -- signed Kay's blue cast. The money will benefit the Fred Hollows Foundation in blindness prevention programs in the Pacific. The TradeMe listing said the foundation estimates there are about 5,000 blind people in the Islands, mainly needing cataract surgery. Another 15,000 suffer from poor vision and need eyeglasses. ""I am very surprised it got to that ... but I am delighted,"" New Zealand's national news agency quoted Key as saying about the winning bid. The cast, which was removed this weekend, is in ""excellent condition,"" Key said. ""Though I don't know whether is is $20,000 worth of condition.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has signed a deployment order to move an additional 3,000 troops to Afghanistan next year, according to U.S. military officials. Helicopters are the main transportation of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, with its high mountain terrain. The troops will be part of a combat aviation brigade, the latest approved by Gates for the expected build-up of U.S. troops in Afghanistan throughout next year. Earlier this year, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. David McKiernan, requested at least 20,000 additional troops be sent there to fight the increasing violence by the resurgent Taliban forces in the southern and eastern parts of the country. The officials could not say what units are being tapped to go because those units are now being told of their deployment and the announcement has not yet been made public. The aviation brigade will send a number of much-needed helicopters to the region. Helicopters are the main transportation of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, where high mountain roads and passes make it difficult for large transport vehicles to move troops and supplies around the country. There are more than 30,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan.  Meanwhile, a Dutch soldier was killed Friday in southern Afghanistan, the NATO command confirmed. The soldier died in an improvised explosive device strike, according to a news release from NATO's International Security Assistance Force.

"(CNN) -- Troubled U.S. insurer AIG will end its shirt sponsorship deal with Premier League and European champions Manchester United next year. End of era: AIG will not renew its four-year sponsorship deal with Manchester United. It was widely believed that AIG would not renew their £19 million ($27 million) per year shirt deal when the four-year contract expired in 2010, due to the financial troubles the company has suffered. And, on Wednesday, the company confirmed this. ""AIG's shirt sponsorship with Manchester United runs through May 2010. We have no plans to renew the deal,"" said a company statement. AIG is still restructuring after receiving a bail-out of $150 billion from the U.S. Government. They also have a £5 million ($6.8 million) per year deal to run MU Finance, but it is not clear what will happen with that contract. Despite the loss of AIG, a Manchester United spokesman told the UK Press Association that the Premier League giants hoped to better the current deal it had with the U.S. insurer. Have your say: Can football's giant salaries survive the financial crisis? ""In line with industry practice, Manchester United is exploring the possibility of a shirt sponsor for the new 2010/11 season. ""The club is in dialogue with a select number of top companies worldwide and has so far received sufficient interest to be confident it can improve on its current £19 million annual partnership with AIG."" Michael Stirling, managing director of Global Sponsors, predicts United will be able to find a new sponsor who will match those figures. ""I think they will do extremely well regardless of the crisis because they have done superbly in being the world club champions. There will be a lot of interest from major brands that want to be associated with the club, no matter the price,"" he told CNN. Massive Indian corporation Sahara are reported in the Indian media to be investigating the Red Devils' proposals, while Saudi Telecom is another company believed to be a potential new sponsor. World Club champions United also have strong links in both Malaysia and South Korea. Meanwhile, AIG have insisted they will honor their four-year agreement, leaving the Old Trafford club in a better position than when Vodafone gave just six months' notice before terminating their deal in 2006.","AIG confirm they will not renew its four-year contract with Manchester United .

"(CNN) -- Swedish car manufacturer Saab, a fully owned subsidiary of General Motors, announced Friday that it will ""file for reorganization ... to create a fully independent business entity."" The Swedish car maker says a formal reorganization is the best way to create an ""entity that's ready for investment."" Under the Swedish court system, an independent administrator will be appointed to work closely with the Saab management team to formulate a reorganization proposal, which will be presented to creditors within three weeks of the filing. Saab said it will continue to operate as usual and in accordance with the formal reorganization process, with the government providing some support during this period. ""We explored and will continue to explore all available options for funding and/or selling Saab and it was determined a formal reorganization would be the best way to create a truly independent entity that is ready for investment,"" said Jan Ake Jonsson, managing director for Saab Automobile. ""Saab has an excellent foundation for strong growth, assuming we can get the funding to complete engineering, tooling and manage launch costs. Reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market, while minimizing the liquidity impact of Saab on GM."" General Motors said this week that it plans shed tens of thousands of employees, close factories, cut product lines and wants billions of dollars in government funding to stave off bankruptcy. When all is said and done, GM said that by 2011 it could need a total of $30 billion, which includes the $13.4 billion in Treasury loans it has already received. In the near term, GM will most certainly need $9.1 billion in additional loans and could require an additional $7.5 billion in the next two years if auto sales don't improve.","Independent adminstrator appointed to form Saab reorganization plan .

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama's two daughters had another reason to high-five their dad's election to the presidency Tuesday night: they're getting a puppy. President Bush's dog  Barney walks in the White House Rose Garden in 2007. ""Sasha and Malia,"" Obama said in his victory speech at Chicago's Grant Park, ""I love you both so much, and you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the White House."" The new White House pet will follow in the paw-steps of a menagerie of animals that have had the run of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue over the years. The Bush family shared their eight years at the White House with a cat, a feisty English springer spaniel and two Scottish terriers -- all of whom have their own pages on the president's Web site. The Clintons' Washington stay included a cat, Socks, who did not get along with their chocolate Labrador retriever, Buddy. And Millie the springer spaniel's canine view of life in the White House -- as ""told to"" then-first lady Barbara Bush -- became a best-seller that outsold the memoirs of President George H.W. Bush. While many presidents took to heart President Harry Truman's admonishment -- ""If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog"" -- first pets have come in all shapes, sizes and species. Thomas Jefferson kept two grizzly bears in a cage on the White House lawn, while John Quincy Adams is said to have let his alligator use a bathtub inside. Calvin Coolidge walked his raccoons on a leash. Theodore Roosevelt's sons escorted their pet pony onto the White House elevator to cheer up a sick sibling. And perhaps the strangest of all: Martin Van Buren briefly owned two tiger cubs, a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Pets have sometimes been a boon to a president's image. But some have also taken a bite out of their popularity. Animal lovers howled in protest when Lyndon B. Johnson picked up his beagles, Him and Her, by the ears to provide photographers a better view. On the other hand, Richard Nixon -- running for vice president and accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions -- successfully defended himself in his famous ""Checkers Speech."" The only gift he ever accepted was ""a little cocker spaniel dog"" that his daughter named Checkers, Nixon said. ""And I just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we are going to keep it,"" he added. Come January, the Obamas will make history by becoming the first African-American family to move into the White House. But if Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, get what they've been promised, the new tenants will keep one long-standing tradition alive ... and wagging.","President-elect Obama promises his daughters a puppy .

"BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- Bedraggled, hungry and dazed, the refugees arrived on the shores of Thailand after fleeing one of the most repressive governments in the world -- the hard-line military regime in Myanmar, also known as Burma. This picture provided to CNN is said to show refugees being towed out to sea by the Thai army. But a CNN investigation has uncovered evidence that for hundreds of Rohingya refugees -- members of a Muslim minority group -- abuse and abandonment at sea were what awaited them in Thailand, at the hands of Thai authorities. Extraordinary photos obtained by CNN from someone directly involved in the Thai operation show refugees on their rickety boats being towed out to sea, cut loose and abandoned. One photo shows the Thai army towing a boatload of some 190 refugees far out to sea.  Watch the backstory on the investigation » . For days, accusations have been carried in several regional papers that the Thai army has been systematically towing boat-loads of Rohingya refugees far out to sea and setting them adrift. The army denied it, and the Thai government has launched an inquiry. CNN's investigation -- based on accounts from tourists, sources in Thailand and a Rohingya refugee who said he was on a boat towed back out to sea -- helps to piece together a picture of survival thwarted by an organized effort not just to repel arriving refugees, but to hold them prisoner on shore, drag them in flimsy boats far out to sea and then abandon them.  Watch CNN's investigation into reports of refugees being set adrift » . Three tourists recently voiced concern to CNN over what they had seen -- and in some cases photographed -- near Thailand's tourist areas. One tourist provided CNN with photos last week of refugees detained by Thai authorities on a beach near a tourist site, with the refugees prone on the sun-bleached sand while guards stood nearby. ""Whenever someone raised their head or moved, they [guards] would strike them with a whip,"" said Australian tourist Andrew Catton. A CNN crew traveled to a remote stretch of the Thai coast four hours north of the tourist island of Phuket to investigate the growing reports that the Thai military was secretly detaining Rohingya refugees before towing them out to sea and setting them adrift. In an isolated beach area, debris including sandals and campfire remnants indicated that large numbers of people had been there but were nowhere to be seen. The crew then traveled to a nearby island, where residents reported that refugees who had escaped were living in the jungle. In one hamlet, villagers had captured a Rohingya man they believed had been living in the jungle for days. The refugee, who identified himself as Iqbal Hussain, told CNN he was on one of six boats in a makeshift refugee fleet that arrived in Thailand in December. He said all six boats with their refugee cargo were towed back out to sea in January, and five of the six boats sank. His boat made it back to shore, and he hid in the jungle for days until nearby villagers captured him. In broken English and using sign language and drawings, he described what happened to the other men on the boats: . ""All men dead,"" he said, putting the number of dead at several hundred. The Rohingya, a persecuted minority in Myanmar, have been fleeing their country in rickety boats for years, in search of a better life. In Thailand, many instead have found deprivation and the possibility of desertion far off shore, according to the CNN investigation. The source who provided CNN with photos of refugees in a boat being towed out to sea stressed that the Thai army had given the refugees food and water, but he also confirmed that the boats had been pulled for more than two days into international waters before they were set adrift. His account directly contradicts briefings by senior Thai army sources who denied any such operation was undertaken. A source in the Thai military, after extensive questioning, did confirm to CNN that the Thai army was operating a dump-at-sea policy. But the source defended it, insisting that each boatload of refugees was always given sufficient supplies of food and water. That source claimed local villagers had become afraid of the hundreds of Rohingya arriving each month, and that they were accusing the refugees of stealing their property and threatening them. CNN asked the government for comment and was told that an investigation was being launched and that Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has plans to call an emergency meeting once the country's foreign minister returns from Cambodia. Panitan Wattanayagorn, a government spokesman, gave no timeline for the foreign minister's return or the emergency meeting. He did say the government is taking the matter very seriously.","CNN finds evidence hundreds of Rohingya refugees abandoned at sea by Thai army .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Rapper Kanye West and his business manager face vandalism, battery and grand theft charges in connection with a scuffle with photographers at Los Angeles International Airport last September. Rapper Kanye West has been charged after an incident last year involving two photographers. The Los Angeles County district attorney declined to file felony charges, but L.A. City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo decided to charge West, 31, and Don Crawley, 33, with misdemeanors Wednesday. Police arrested West on September 11, 2008, after an altercation with two paparazzi, airport police said. The incident, which took place near the airport's Terminal 4, occurred between the rap star and Crawley -- his road manager and bodyguard -- and a photographer and a cameraman who were taking their photos, airport police said. The cameras of the paparazzi were damaged in the altercation, police said. West was charged with one count of vandalism, one count of grand theft and one count of battery, according to Frank Mateljan, the spokesman for the city attorney. Crawley was charged with two counts of vandalism, two counts of grand theft and two counts of battery, Mateljan said. If convicted of all charges, West could face up to two years and six months in jail, while Crawley could face up to five years, he said. Their arraignment hearing is set for April 14 at the Los Angeles Airport Courthouse, he said. West, a 10-time Grammy winner, and Crawley were in the airport to catch a flight to Honolulu, Hawaii, police said. The pair were outside of passenger security screening when the incident occurred. CNN could not immediately reach the star's publicist for comment. The celebrity Web site TMZ posted a video of the incident shot by one of its reporters, who was also in the terminal when the altercation occurred. The video was short and chaotic, and the man whom TMZ identifies as West never shows his face, which is shrouded in the hood of a gray sweatshirt. According to the Web site, after West grabbed the camera from the photographer, Crawley took it from him, leaving the rap star with the lighting component. The video shows the man in the gray sweatshirt and another man in a red sweatshirt -- whom TMZ identifies as Crawley -- each smashing parts of a camera on the ground. Then the man in red approaches the camera as it is filming. He reaches out for the camera, and it appears a struggle ensues. As airport officials arrive, the man walks off. TMZ reported that after the incident with the first photographer, Crawley grabbed the TMZ reporter's camera and allegedly broke it. Police stopped West and Crawley as they tried to leave to go through security to board the plane, the Web site said. TMZ is partly owned by AOL, part of CNN's parent company, Time Warner. West quickly became a hip-hop star after his first album, ""College Dropout,"" debuted in 2004, earning him a best rap album Grammy that year. He twice matched that feat with 2005's ""Late Registration"" and 2007's ""Graduation."" West also has won three best rap song Grammys for his hits ""Jesus Walks,"" ""Diamonds from Sierra Leone"" and ""Good Life."" His other four Grammys include two best rap solo performance awards, one for best rap performance by a duo or group, and one for best R&B song for his role in helping write ""You Don't Know My Name,"" a song performed by Alicia Keys. The platinum rapper is also known for controversial outbursts, most notably in 2005, when he went off script during an NBC telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina, saying, ""George Bush doesn't care about black people.""","Kanye West and his manager charged with vandalism, theft and battery .

"(CNN)  -- Two former presidents reflected on their greatest regrets in office Monday, each looking back to issues that continue to plague the nation years later. Former presidents and political rivals Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush now share philanthropic efforts. Former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton appeared together at a question-and-answer forum before the National Automobile Dealers Association in New Orleans, Louisiana. Asked his biggest regret after leaving office, Bush said he now wonders whether he should have tried to get Saddam Hussein to leave office at the end of the first Gulf War in 1991. He told the gathering, ""I've thought a lot about it, but at the end of Desert Storm, the question was should we have kind of kept going on that road to death and all this slaughter until Saddam Hussein showed up and laid his sword on the table, surrendered. And the common wisdom was he wouldn't do that."" But he said a conversation with an FBI agent who interrogated Saddam after he was captured has made him reconsider. Bush recalled their talk, ""I said, 'What if we just say he has to come to surrender, would he have done it?' And this guy said, 'I'm absolutely convinced he would have.' My experts tell me he wouldn't have."" Bush said, ""We ended it the way we said we would"" as a military success, but noted a cleaner ending ""would have been perfect."" He added, ""If we had tried to get Saddam Hussein to come and literally surrender and put his sword on the table, I think it might have been avoided some of the problems that we did have in the future from him."" On a day that President Barack Obama dispatched George Mitchell to the Middle East as the latest U.S. envoy, Clinton discussed the failure to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians. ""My No. 1 regret is that I was not able to persuade Yasser Arafat to accept the peace plan I offered at the end of my presidency that the Israelis accepted. ""If he had done that ... we had had seven years of progress toward peace. We had one year in 1998, the only year in the history of Israel where not a single soul was killed in a terrorist act. The Palestinians had more control over West Bank then than they do today,"" Clinton said. ""And if he had taken that deal, we would have a Palestinian state and we would have had, I think now, normal peaceful relations with Israel and all of its Arab neighbors."" Clinton said a deal would have helped the U.S. handle other issues in the region, saying, ""We'd be much better positioned to deal with the problem of Iran, and we would have taken away about half the arguments of terrorists around the world by giving the Palestinians their state and creating a cooperative, positive interdependence in the Middle East, not a negative one. And so, I think that would have done more good to save more lives and help more people, and I wish I had been able to do that. "" Clinton also said he regretted not doing more to ""stop the Rwandan genocide,"" and succeeding on a new health care plan. He said ""presidents should share freely ... the mistakes they made"" with historians, because it teaches lessons. He said he shared problems during the lunch with Obama and the four living presidents, saying, ""You want each new president to make new mistakes, not the same ones."" Clinton added, ""all of us know if you make enough decisions, you're going to make a few of them aren't right.""","Middle East leaves George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton with some regrets .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British reality TV star Jade Goody married Sunday after being told by doctors last week that her cancer is terminal. Jade Goody, pictured with fiance Jack Tweed Saturday,  before Sunday's wedding . Goody, 27 tied the knot with boyfriend Jack Tweed, 21, in Hatfield Heath, Essex, east of London, UK media reported. After the ceremony Max Clifford, the couple's publicist, told waiting reporters that there had been ""lots of tears and smiles and laughter"" and that the congregation gave the newlyweds a standing ovation after the signing of the register. Goody sprung to fame in ""Big Brother"" in 2002, going on to launch a range of her own products and host TV shows. But her return to the celebrity edition of the show in 2007 ended in international ignominy, after her taunting of Indian Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty. Goody's behavior resulted in more than 40,000 complaints and sparked protests in India.  Shetty said last week that she was unable to attend the wedding due to filming commitments but was praying for Goody. Read blog about how media covered wedding . In August 2008 Goody appeared on the Indian version of ""Big Brother,"" only to fly home after she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. News of Goody's condition has sparked massive interest in the UK, both from the media -- which bid for rights to her story -- and among the public, who have contacted charities for information about cervical cancer. Critics have attacked Goody's decision to sell rights to what may be her final weeks, although the star has told British media that she wants to leave her children by a previous relationship -- sons, Bobby, five, and Freddie, four -- financially secure. Watch Jade Goody's wedding preparations » . But Clifford told ITN: ""Ironically, a big part of what she's doing now is to fund her children's education. To give them the education she never had."" Charity Cancer Research UK said in a statement earlier this month that daily visits to its Web site had increased two- to three-fold since news of Goody's illness was announced. ""The publicity around Jade's diagnosis has led many more people to ask questions and seek information about cervical cancer,"" spokeswoman Emma Gilgunn-Jones said. Shetty, writing on her blog earlier this week, said that Goody had invited her to the wedding but had been unable to attend due to filming commitments in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""Read an article on Jade Goody's deteriorating condition,"" wrote Shetty. ""It disturbed me 'cause the last time I spoke to her, she seemed very positive and we were all expecting that the doctors would be able to curb the cancer from spreading. This piece of news came as a shock - so I called her hoping it was only a rumor but she confirmed it. Shetty added that she was praying for Goody and that she hoped God ""gives her the strength to cope with this pain."" ""She wants the best for her kids,"" Shetty wrote. ""I hope Jack makes a good father to them. I also hope for a miracle to happen for her children's sake."" On Friday the UK's Ministry of Justice said it would allow Tweed, who was jailed in September 2008 for assault, to spend his wedding night with his bride, the Press Association reported. ""We are absolutely thrilled,"" the agency reported Clifford as saying. ""It will be the dream finish to her dream day, and it makes so much difference. Tweed, who was released early from jail in January, has to wear a tag and is subject to a 1900 GMT curfew. ""We'll get married if I have to drag her wheelchair down the aisle,"" he told ITN last week. The wedding dress, which media reports say included a pouch to hold Goody's medication, was donated by Harrods owner Mohamed al Fayed.  Goody's bridesmaids were seen with the TV star Saturday, wearing plastic bald caps in a show of solidarity at the impact of her chemotherapy treatment.","Publicist: Couple receive standing ovation, lots of tears, laughter, smiles .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City have confirmed that absent Brazilian striker Robinho will be back in time for the Premier League side's return to training next week. Robinho had a reputation for partying prior to his British-record transfer to Manchester City last August. City manager Mark Hughes told the club's official Web site that Robinho, who cost mega-rich City a British record fee of £32.5 million ($45m) when he signed from Real Madrid in August, will be spoken to after not joining the rest of the squad in a Tenerife training camp this week -- choosing instead to fly to Brazil to attend to a family matter. Hughes told mcfc.co.uk: ""Robbie left without permission, he felt that he had personal things that he needed to attend to. ""He made the decision to leave the camp, and go back to Brazil. That was not with my permission, and the situation at the moment is not really practical to get him back here with time differences and length of flights, so he will be back at the weekend ready to train when we are back in Manchester at the first available opportunity. ""Once he is back, I will sit down with him and explain my feelings, and decisions will be made after that. He has rung me, and he understands that we need to address this -- and we will. Then we will move on. Robinho's decision to fly to Brazil came on the same day that City announced they were pulling out of a world record transfer move for AC Milan star Kaka, a Brazilian team-mate of Robinho. However. Hughes has insisted that that two matters are completely unrelated. Robinho is no stranger to controversy and had a reputation as a party-goer prior to his move to Manchester last year. He was dropped by his former Madrid coach, and now England national coach, Fabio Capello, who questioned his attitude and Robinho's eventual departure from the Spanish club was acrimonious. In fact, in October 2007, Robinho failed to return to Madrid after appearing for Brazil in an international match, claiming he had missed his flight. Local newspapers later revealed that he had been seen partying in a popular Rio de Janeiro nightclub and he was subsequently fined and dropped by the club.","Robinho will return to Manchester City in time for return to training next week .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The National Transportation Safety Board and other agencies are investigating not only what went wrong, but also what went right Thursday when a US Airways flight ended in the Hudson River without any deaths or major injuries. The aircraft remains in the Hudson River on Friday. Workers hope to lift it out Saturday morning. ""Having a successful ditching is a very rare event,"" Kitty Higgins of the NTSB said Friday. ""We'll not only celebrate what worked here, but also learn what worked. So many times you're only focused on what went wrong. A lot of things went right yesterday."" Divers struggled against strong currents and frigid water temperatures to retrieve critical pieces of the puzzle from the Hudson River, where US Airways flight 1549 ended up less than three minutes after it took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport Thursday afternoon. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- both critical to determining exactly what happened -- remained attached to the tail section of the aircraft, which was still partially submerged but secured to moorings.

After the plane came to a stop, passengers quickly got out, standing on the partially submerged wings or on the emergency exit chutes, which also serve as life rafts. New York Waterway Capt.

""I said to my deck hand, 'That's an odd-looking boat,' "" he told reporters Friday. ""He said, 'I think that's an airplane.' "" The ferry headed straight for the plane, he said. ""I was a little overwhelmed and scared for the people. The water is about 32 degrees. The outside air temp was in the 20s. We were worried if we didn't get them out right away, there would be casualties."" As he arrived, he said, most passengers were calm, but some were cheering and crying. Some said, ""Get me out of the water, please, I'm cold.""  Watch a Coast Guard lieutenant talk about rescuing passengers » . Detective Michael Delaney, an NYPD diver, recalled seeing a woman in the water clinging to the side of a ferry ""in obvious distress"" when he arrived. ""We pretty much saw the distress that was in her face,"" he said. He and other divers pulled her off the side of the boat and swam her over to another boat and to safety, he said. The New York Waterway ferry reached the scene in less than four minutes, city officials said at a news conference on Friday. The first ambulance reached the shore in a minute and 12 seconds. Other boats arrived at the plane within seven minutes. About 25 people were treated at hospitals after the incident, but Bloomberg said Thursday there were no serious injures. Only a few people remained hospitalized Friday, according to the hospitals. They included a flight attendant with a deep laceration to her leg and a Coast Guard rescuer with a minor hematoma -- a localized swelling filled with blood. The flight attendant was in stable condition and the rescuer was in good condition. Most patients were treated and released, the hospitals said. With the air and water temperatures at the time of the incident, people could remain in the water only two to three minutes before the onset of hypothermia, said John Peruggia, chief of emergency medical services for FDNY. NTSB  investigators planned to speak with Sullenberger and his co-pilot on Saturday, Higgins said.

"(CNN)  -- After deliberating for only 45 minutes, a jury convicted an Alabama man Thursday of throwing his four children off a Gulf Coast bridge in January 2008, according to prosecutors. Lam Luong, 38, admitted throwing the children, who ranged in age from 3 years to 4 months, off the Dauphin Island bridge south of Mobile, according to CNN affiliate WKRG. Charged with five counts of capital murder, he changed his plea to guilty last week. However, Alabama law requires that all capital cases go before a judge and jury, WKRG said. The sentencing phase of Luong's trial will begin Friday, the Mobile County District Attorney's office told CNN. Jurors will decide whether he should receive the death penalty or life in prison without parole. A judge is not bound by the jury's decision, however, and Alabama law requires an automatic appeal in capital cases. Luong and his wife were having marital difficulties, prosecutors said. WKRG reported that during opening arguments in the trial, prosecutors told jurors Luong threw the kids off the bridge so he could see the look on his wife's face. Luong was on crack at the time, and he told investigators they could charge him if they found the children's bodies before breaking into laughter, jurors were told. The defense called no witnesses, but told jurors Luong was intoxicated at the time and was incapable of forming the necessary intent to be convicted of a capital offense, asking them to convict him of manslaughter, WKRG said. During the trial, jurors heard about the search for the children's bodies and saw graphic video of the bodies floating in the water, the station reported. A commercial fisherman recording rough weather off the coast of Venice, Louisiana, found one body, while two duck hunters and a Mississippi marine officer found the other three, according to WKRG.

"(OPRAH.com) -- One of the original Kings of Comedy, Steve Harvey is the host of one of the most popular radio shows in the country, ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show."" His first book, ""Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man,"" is shooting to the top of the best-seller lists, and Oprah Winfrey says she loves everything it has to say! Harvey says this book has a special meaning for him. ""This is the first project that I didn't do for money,"" he says. ""Other than my foundation -- mentoring programs -- everything I do is for money. I tell jokes for a check; I'm on TV for a check. ... But this [book] right here I did purely to empower women."" In his book, Harvey says the way a man introduces you gives good insight into the status of your relationship. If a man introduces you as a friend or says your name with no title at all, Harvey says you have nothing. ""We're very protective. We mark our territory. If a man loves you...he's willing to profess it. He'll give you a title after a while. You're going to be his lady, his woman, his fiancée, his wife, his baby's mama, something,"" he says. ""If he's introducing you after six months, 'This is...Oprah,' you should be standing there going, 'This is going nowhere.'""  Oprah.com: Read an excerpt from this best-selling book! Man with a plan . Another thing women need to understand, according to Harvey, is that every man has a plan. ""Men don't come up to you to just talk. We come up to you with a plan,"" he says. ""We're looking across the room at you, and we don't care about your hopes and dreams. We don't care about what your future holds. We saw something we wanted."" When a man approaches a woman, Harvey says, he already knows what we wants from her, but he doesn't know what it will cost. ""How much time do you want from me? What your standards? What are your requirements? Because we'll rise to the occasion no matter how high you set the bar if we want to,"" he says. ""The problem is, women have stopped setting the bar high."" Oprah.com: What's your love type? The cookie . Though a woman might want many things from a man, Harvey says men only need three things: support, loyalty and sex. Or as Harvey calls it, ""the cookie."" ""We've got to have your support. Whatever adventure we're out on, whatever pursuit in life, we need your support. Then we need your loyalty. That's your love. We've got to know that you belong to us,"" he says. ""And we've got to have a cookie. Everybody likes cookies. That's the thing about a cookie. I like oatmeal raisin...but if you've got vanilla cream, I'll eat that too."" Kickin' it . In his book, Harvey tells the story of his father-in-law's first introduction to one of Harvey's daughter's boyfriends. ""[My 26-year-old daughter] was dating this guy who was about 30. He had been over to the house about four, five times. And my father-in-law was visiting from Memphis,"" Harvey says. ""He's in the kitchen and he's eating and [my daughter's] boyfriend is in there, and [my father-in-law] goes: 'So, son, sit down. Tell me, what's your plan for my granddaughter?'"" After plenty of hemming and hawing, Harvey says the boyfriend finally said that the two were just ""kickin' it."" Harvey was pretty confident his daughter didn't have the same interpretation of the relationship, he says. ""I said: 'Cool. Let's bring my daughter in there. Let's inform her that she's just being kicked...let's see if that's what she wants to do,"" he says. ""They broke up the next day."" Gone fishin' Harvey says men are like fishermen -- but women are actually the ones looking for a good catch. You won't be able to find one, though, until you up your standards. ""You've got sports fishermen, and you've got guys out there fishing to eat. You've got guys that are fishing to keep the fish, and you've got guys that are fishing to catch them, unhook them and throw them back,"" Harvey says. ""You've got to determine along the way which one of the fish you're going to be."" Without ironclad standards, Harvey says you'll always end up back in the dating pool. ""You've got to quit lowering your standards,"" he says. ""Set your requirements up front so when a guy hooks you, he has to know this is business."" And don't let the man set the pace of the relationship -- Harvey says it's always the woman who has total control. ""With all that power, why do you suddenly relinquish this power just because you want a guy to accept you? That's stupid,"" he says. ""Say: 'Look, if you want to be with me, this is what you got to do. This is what it takes to get to me.'"" When should you sleep with your new boyfriend? As an auto plant worker, Harvey says he had to wait 90 days to receive benefits -- and says the same probation period should apply to dating. ""In 90 days they checked me out. They determined if I was easy to work with, if I got along well with others, if I showed up when I said I was going to show up, if I was worthy."" Women, Harvey says, hold the greatest benefit of all -- the cookie -- so there's no reason to give it away until you know your man deserves it. ""Slow down, ladies,"" Harvey says. ""Look, you cannot run us off."" So what if you don't want to wait 90 days? Harvey says if you change the probation period, you do so at your own risk. ""You all keep changing the rules. And men are aware of the fact that you are changing the rules. We're aware of the fact that you act desperate. We're aware of the fact that you think there's a good shortage of good men out there,"" he says. ""We play on all of that. ... We created the term 'gold digger' so you won't ask us for nothing. We created the term 'nagging' so you can quit badgering us. These are terms that we created so you can require less of us."" Mr. fix-it . Harvey says four little words can strike fear and dread into any man: We need to talk. ""You just drove a nail in his forehead,"" Harvey says. Men are fixers, not talkers, Harvey says, so it's better to get to the point. ""When you say, 'We need to talk,' we put up the barriers,"" he says. ""I tell ladies, just sit down and strike up a conversation."" Oprah.com: How to talk to a brick wall . Turn off the text . Social networking Web sites and text messages can be a great way to keep in touch with friends, but Harvey says it's not the best way to date. ""You have nothing if you're texting a guy in a relationship,"" he says. ""We can text six women a minute. We can text it and push 'reply all.' I mean, since we're lying, we might as well lie to everybody."" If you want the relationship to be more, take it face-to-face. ""Women talk about [how] chivalry's dead. Chivalry's not dead -- it's just not required anymore,"" he says. ""You've got to get a guy in your face. Look in his eyes. ... God has given you all this incredible thing called intuition. You've got to use that."" Safety first . You know you've got a keeper when your man wants to make sure you're always safe, Harvey says. Every man wants to protect his woman, and Harvey says this instinct kicks in when his wife, Marjorie, scuba dives. ""I can't go home without her. We've got seven kids between us,"" Harvey says. ""They need their mother. I'm not a good mother at all."" Although Marjorie is a certified diver, Harvey isn't a swimmer. ""I have a security guy who can swim,"" he says. ""So [he puts] on the snorkeling gear and when she goes down, I tell him, 'You swim over and just keep an eye on my wife.'"" Harvey also has instructions for everyone else on the boat. ""I told all the dive masters on the boat: 'If she does not come out of that water in 30 minutes, everybody in the water. Everybody. We're doing a dive search right here,'"" he says. ""I don't care if nobody [else] on the boat goes home. She goes home."" Oprah.com: How to read his body language . From The Oprah Winfrey Show .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani scientist who admitted leaking nuclear secrets to North Korea, Iran and Libya and then recanted his confession, has been released from house arrest after it was declared illegal by the Islamabad High Court, his attorney told CNN Friday. Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan meets the media outside his residence Friday. ""What the court declared is that he is a free citizen which means effectively... the basic human rights are available to him like any other citizen,"" said attorney Syed Ali Zafar. The Pakistani government was slow to acknowledge the high court's ruling. A spokesman said the Interior Ministry hasn't received the official court ruling, but will comply with whatever decision was made. Government attorneys said they expected an official announcement to be made by Saturday. But evidence of the end of Khan's house arrest seemed clear outside his home in an upscale part of Islamabad. Where a government security detail previously stood guard with machine guns, cars were parked and reporters roamed the area scratching for details. Khan made a brief appearance, saying he was outside because of the court's ruling, but gave few other details. In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she is ""very much concerned"" about Khan's release. Separately, acting deputy State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said: ""This man remains a serious proliferation risk.,"" he said. ""The proliferation support that Khan and his associates provided to Iran and North Korea has had a harmful impact ... on international security and will for years to come."" Khan is widely regarded as a hero in Pakistan for his part in helping the country to develop nuclear weapons. In 2004, Khan was placed under house arrest following his admission on Pakistan television that he had been involved in a clandestine international network selling nuclear weapons technology from Pakistan to a host of nations including Iran and North Korea. Pakistan has so far refused to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency and the U.S. access to Khan to quiz him on the extent of the nuclear secrets he sold. ""Even if they had asked me I wouldn't have answered,"" he said last year. In May 2008, Khan denied his involvement with the spread of nuclear arms outside Pakistan. He explained in an interview with ABC News that the Pakistani government and then-President Pervez Musharraf forced him to be a ""scapegoat"" for the ""national interest."" He also denies ever traveling to Iran or Libya and said that North Korea's nuclear program was well advanced before his visit.","NEW: U.S. concerned at Abdul Qadeer Khan's release from house arrest .

"(CNN) -- Iran is to send a female skier to the Winter Olympics for the first time at next year's Games in Vancouver, Canada, the head of the Islamic Republic's ski federation told state media Monday. Fatemeh Kiadarbandsari, competing at last month's World Ski Championships, in France. The chosen competitor will ski in ""full Islamic dress,"" Iran's National News Agency reported. Three women Fatemeh Kiadarbandsari, Mitra Kalhor and Marjan Kalhor are vying for the place on the national team alongside three male skiers, said Iranian Ski Federation head Isa Saveh-Shemshaki. Trials for the team will be held in December, two months ahead of the event. Iran has sent male athletes to every Winter Games since 1956. Skiing is hugely popular in Iran with some of the region's best slopes in the Zagros Mountains just a two-hour drive from the country's capital Tehran. At weekends during the seven-month ski season it is common to see long queues of traffic on routes to resorts. With a growing ski tourism industry, the price of the sport has steadily increased. But with fewer social restrictions on the pistes than in other areas of Iranian life, the sport remains a popular pursuit for the country's youth. Until recently, many slopes were strictly segregated with men and women skiing on different sides of the mountain. But while it is still illegal to travel in the same chair lift or gondola, the country's strict religious laws are visibly more lax at 3,000 meters. Iran took just three women among 53 athletes to last year's Beijing Olympics but the choice of 19-year-old female rower Homa Hosseini to carry the flag during the opening ceremony infuriated strict Islamists. Current president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who faces an election this year, was forced to back down from an initiative ealry in his current term to encourage female participation in sport because of criticism from the country's religious leaders. One mullah reportedly said that women should not ski because the movement of their knees looked ""more like dancing than sport.""","Iran set to send female athlete to next year's Winter Olympics for the first time .

"BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- The tribunal established to prosecute people allegedly responsible for the killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 22 others will officially convene at The Hague in Netherlands on Sunday. White wreaths with photos of Rafik Hariri at his tomb. The car bomb in Beirut in February 2005 transformed the turbulent nation's politics and sent shock waves across the Middle East and the world. ""All the necessary measures have been taken for the Special Tribunal for Lebanon to commence functioning,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon wrote in his latest report to the U.N. Security Council. Daniel Bellemare, a Canadian, will be the U.N. tribunal's prosecutor. The trial judges and appeals chambers will take on their responsibilities on a date determined by Ban and the tribunal's president. The United Nations says the case is expected to be ready for trial by 2010. At the time of Hariri's death, neighboring Syria had immense political influence Lebanon, where it had had a troop presence from the 1980s, after the fighting between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon. Hariri was admired for spearheading the rebuilding of Beirut after the country's civil war, from 1975 to 1990, and many Lebanese blamed Syria for the killing, citing Hariri's patriotism and strong sense of Lebanese independence. The killing sparked widespread protests that led to the eventual withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon and the election of an anti-Syrian bloc in parliament. The anti-Syrian movement is known as the March 14 Alliance, named after the day millions of supporters of Hariri took to the streets, and its actions have been dubbed the Cedar Revolution, for the nation's iconic cedar trees. Huge counterprotests also were staged by Lebanese supporters of Syria.  Watch how Lebanon changed after Hariri's death » . Along the way, U.N. investigators tasked to probe the attack found links between Syria's government and Hariri's assassination. Three people detained for three years in connection with the case were released Wednesday by a Lebanese judge. Four Lebanese generals who have been held for nearly four years in connection with the attack remain in custody. The Lebanese hope the tribunal will settle the case, but there are also fears it could further divide the nation and open up older wounds in the country. Rami Khoury, a political analyst and a professor at the American University of Beirut, said the tribunal could serve as a political flashpoint, but he said the existence of the tribunal is important. ""It's an extraordinary symbol of the whole world coming in here, to the Arab world, and saying this has to stop, we're going to find who did it and hold them accountable,"" he said. ""So it's tremendously important, I think, in what it represents."" The special tribunal takes over from the Beirut-based International Independent Investigation Commission, which looked into 20 other attacks and found elements linking some of them to a criminal network behind the Hariri killing, the United Nations said.","U.N. tribunal for killing of former Lebanon prime minister to convene Sunday .

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- The United Arab Emirates has refused to grant a visa to a female Israeli tennis player, preventing her from competing in the Sony Ericsson World Tennis Association Tour in Dubai, the WTA said in a statement Sunday. The UAE has refused to grant a visa allowing Shahar Peer to compete in Dubai. Shahar Peer would have been the first Israeli athlete to participate in a professional sporting event in the UAE, CNN Sports correspondent Pedro Pinto said. The UAE has no diplomatic ties with Israel. Peer told CNN on Sunday evening she was ""very, very disappointed"" to be denied access to the tournament. ""Any player that qualifies should attend, and I was prevented,"" she said from Israel. ""I'm glad the WTA support me. A red line was crossed for every athlete in the world -- politics should be kept separate from sports."" The governing body of women's tennis said it was ""deeply disappointed"" that Peer was being denied entry to the country hosting the tournament, but it did not cancel the competition, which began Sunday. The move runs counter to WTA policy, which says no player should be barred from competing in a tournament for which she has qualified. Dubai could lose its membership in the WTA tour next year over the ban on Peer, according to WTA rules. That would mean professional players could compete only in exhibition matches in Dubai, the results of which would not count in pro rankings. Government officials in Dubai have not responded to CNN's request to comment over their refusal to allow Peer to compete in the event. ""Ms. Peer has earned the right to play in the tournament, and it is regrettable that the UAE is denying her this right,"" said Larry Scott, chairman and chief executive of the tour.  Watch Scott express disappointment » . ""Following various consultations, the tour has decided to allow the tournament to continue to be played this week, pending further review by the tour's board of directors."" The patron of the Dubai Tennis Championships is Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Makhtoum. Two million dollars in prize money is on the line. Al-Makhtoum told CNN in 2004 that Dubai would accept Israeli students to a school dedicated to students from the Middle East who are talented at sports. In 2003, Dubai hosted World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings, which Israeli government officials attended. The Israeli flag -- among other member states' flags -- is still part of a globe monument in Dubai. Peer, 21, is ranked 48th in the world among female tennis players. She was allowed to compete at the Doha tournament in Qatar last year, where she received a warm welcome, according to Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz. Qatar, another Gulf Arab state, froze diplomatic ties with Israel after Israel's military offensive in Gaza last month. Peer downplayed the political undertones of her participation in last year's Doha tournament, telling Haaretz that she didn't come to Qatar ""to help the politics of course."" But she added that if her playing in the tournament ""can help for peace or anything, I'd be really happy."" Scott said the tour will ""review appropriate remedies for Ms. Peer"" as well as ""appropriate future actions with regard to the future of the Dubai tournament."" Peer was advised Saturday by tournament and WTA officials of the denial of her visa while she was participating in a tournament in Pattaya, Thailand, according to a WTA statement. The Dubai Tennis Championships runs through February 28.","NEW: Shahar Peer, female Israeli tennis player, says she's ""very, very disappointed""

"(CNN)  -- Liberia's president has declared a state of emergency after hordes of ravenous caterpillars infested the country. The African armyworm caterpillar is chewing its way through Liberia's food crops. Tens of millions of the worm-like larvae have appeared in the northern part of the country, where they are destroying green crops like cabbage and collard greens and contaminating the water supply, Liberian Information Minister Laurance Bropleh told CNN Wednesday from the capital of Monrovia. ""I am not aware that they have been here before, ever, and certainly not in this great number,"" Bropleh told CNN. ""That is why it was so overwhelming initially when we first discovered it."" The state of emergency covers the three northern Liberian counties of Bong, Lofa, and Gbarpolu, Liberian officials said. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told legislators Monday that 350,000 people in 62 communities in those three counties may have been affected. There are also indications the bugs have spread to neighboring Guinea, Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast, Bropleh said. ""This is indeed a crisis,"" the president said Monday. Johnson Sirleaf said she appointed a task force, including members of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to identify the species and commence spraying. Investigators suspect the caterpillars are African armyworms, the FAO said. The infestation is ""quite alarming,"" said Winfred Hammond, the FAO representative in Liberia. Hammond said the caterpillars started showing up sometime during the week of January 12 but spread quickly. In just a week, he said, the caterpillars had spread to 50 villages. The pests multiply rapidly and adult moths are able to fly long distances at night, the FAO said. Worsening the situation, the area's water supply has been contaminated by the huge volume of feces dropped by the caterpillars, the FAO said. ""The plague is being described as Liberia's worst in 30 years,"" the FAO said. ""The last African armyworm outbreak in the sub-region occurred in Ghana in 2006.""","Liberia declares emergency after hordes of ravenous caterpillars infest country .

"PARIS, France (CNN)  -- Opposition lawmakers Tuesday ridiculed President Nicolas Sarkozy for taking France back into NATO's military command after more than 40 years, but were unable to stop the move when it came to a vote. French troops on patrol with the Afghan army as part of the NATO mission in Afghanistan. The National Assembly voted in favor of Sarkozy's plan, 329-238. Socialist Laurent Fabius, a former prime minister, told Prime Minister Francois Fillon: ""You tell us this would mean more independence and more influence. It would probably mean less independence and less influence."" The move did not technically require parliamentary approval, but the president's party scheduled the debate to give opponents a chance to voice their opinions -- and to show a majority backed it. Asking the National Assembly to vote on the issue also showed how sensitive the matter is in France. France was a founding member of the NATO alliance in 1949 but it left the military structure in 1966 amid friction with the United States. ""To cooperate is to lose your independence,"" French President Charles de Gaulle said at the time. For the next 43 years, even though France selectively participated in NATO military operations, de Gaulle's principle remained the governing cornerstone of French foreign policy. If Paris took orders from NATO military commanders, it was reasoned, the nation would no longer have complete control of its destiny. Sarkozy, however, believes the opposite -- that cooperation in NATO is a guarantee of French independence. Rejoining NATO's military command, he argued, will give France a seat at the table for decision-making. From its earliest years, the organization's trans-Atlantic ties were strained because U.S. analysts warned that if the European allies failed to increase their contributions to the alliance, they risked losing the support of the United States, according to NATO. Meanwhile, the European nations felt the United States was trying to dominate the organization, according to NATO. De Gaulle's 1966 decision meant no French forces could be under permanent allied command and that France would have no participation in defense planning. In 1995, France rejoined NATO's military committee, which advises NATO's political authorities on military policy and strategy and provides guidance on military matters to NATO's strategic commanders. While France was still not a part of the military command, it contributed troops and funding to NATO activities, including actions in Kosovo and Afghanistan. Half of all French troops outside the country are assigned to NATO military operations. Opponents of Sarkozy's move -- who include some members of his party -- believe de Gaulle, not Sarkozy, had it right. They started a last-minute petition drive to stop his march back into NATO. ""With this decision, France will return as a subordinate country and will lose its ability to represent another image in the world,"" said Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, a member of the French National Assembly. The president's allies calculate Sarkozy's move will strengthen Europe's hand on defense issues. ""There will be more European weight in the way decisions will be made,"" said Louis Giscard d'Estaing, a member of the National Assembly's U.S. Friendship Committee. ""Therefore, the balance of power between the USA and Europe will be re-established within this French move.""

"(CNN) -- A California jury Wednesday recommended the death penalty after convicting a man on murder and arson charges in the deaths of five U.S. Forest Service firefighters who died in a 2006 blaze outside Los Angeles. Smoke rises over a flag flying at half-staff for fallen firefighters October 27, 2006, in Banning, California. Raymond Lee Oyler of Beaumont, California, was convicted on five counts of first-degree murder, including two special circumstances -- that the murders were committed during an arson and that multiple murders were committed -- making him eligible for the death penalty. Oyler was also convicted of 11 counts of arson and 10 counts of use of an incendiary device in those arsons. Sentencing is set for June 5. Firefighters Mark Loutzenhiser, 44; Jess McLean, 27; Jason McKay, 27; and Daniel Hoover-Najera, 20, died October 26, 2006, during a blaze called the Esperanza fire when the wildfire, fueled by Santa Ana winds, enveloped their engine. The fifth firefighter, Pablo Cerda, 23, died October 31, 2006, at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, where he had been taken after sustaining burns over 90 percent of his body. Days before being charged in Esperanza Fire, Oyler had been arrested and charged with two counts of arson in a June 2006 fire in the Banning Pass area. The 41,173-acre Esperanza fire outside Los Angeles destroyed 34 homes and 20 outbuildings, mainly in the Twin Pines and Poppet Flats areas, which had been under mandatory evacuations. The firefighters died trying to protect a partially built house in Twin Pines, a rural mountain community.","Jury convicts man on five counts of first-degree murder, 11 counts of arson .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen shot and killed a food monitor for the United Nations' World Food Program on Thursday, the second killing of a WFP humanitarian worker in Somalia in three days, a spokesman for the agency said Thursday. Mohamud Omar Moallim, a food monitor for the United Nations, was killed in Somalia on Thursday, the U.N. says. Peter Smerdon said Mohamud Omar Moallim, 49, was shot by unidentified gunmen while distributing food to displaced people at Daynile, 6 miles (10 kilometers) northwest of Mogadishu. The gunmen put Moallim's body in a WFP vehicle and drove away, then pushed the corpse from the vehicle and drove on, Smerdon said. Moallim joined WFP in 1993 and worked until 1995 as a logistics assistant. He rejoined the agency in May 2006 as a food monitor. He was abducted in September 2008 for 16 hours outside Mogadishu. He leaves two wives and 11 children. Colleagues said Moallim was calm, extremely hard-working and highly responsible and was often consulted for advice and support by other staff members. On Tuesday, three masked men shot and killed 44-year-old Somali national Ibrahim Hussein Duale while he was monitoring food distribution at a school in Yubsan village, near the Gedo regional capital of Garbahare, the WFP said. Witnesses say the gunmen approached Duale while he was seated, ordered him to stand up and then shot him, according to the account on the WFP Web site. Duale leaves a wife and five children. He joined WFP in 2006 as a food monitor in the Gedo region, which borders Kenya and Ethiopia.","U.N. aid worker shot by unidentified gunman while handing out food, U.N. says .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- The Disney family film update, ""Race to Witch Mountain,"" won the weekend box office in fine fashion, grossing $25 million according to Sunday's estimates from Media by Numbers. ""Race to Witch Mountain"" won the weekend box office in fine fashion, grossing $25 million. That's the second best opening ever for a movie fronted by Dwayne Johnson alone, trailing only the first feature that starred the artist formerly known as The Rock, ""The Scorpion King,"" which banked $36.1 million in its 2002 debut. ""Race to Witch Mountain's"" take was in line with expectations and garnered an okay CinemaScore grade of B+ from an audience that was 60 percent female. It should stay strong at the box office at least until ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" opens in two weeks. Also in ""Race to Witch Mountain's"" favor: weak competition from reigning champ ""Watchmen"" (No. 2), which dropped a hefty 67 percent from its big opening last weekend to gross $18.1 million. Zack Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark superhero saga is clearly slowing down, although it has grossed $86 million in 10 days. Freshman fright flick ""The Last House on the Left"" was next at No. 3, with an anticipated $14.7 million. That's a decent sum for a horror movie that had the added benefit of opening on ""Friday the 13th;"" indeed, it's in line with what most scary remakes tend to bring in on their first weekends. Thus, you can expect this film (which got a so-so B CinemaScore review) to fall off the map after this frame, since that's also what most horror movies do. ""Taken"" (No. 4 with $6.7 million) remained in the top five well into its second month at the multiplex. Tyler Perry's ""Madea Goes to Jail"" came in at No. 5 with $5.1 million. And the weekend's other new wide release, the Playboy-centric comedy ""Miss March,"" grossed an unsexy $2.3 million way down at No. 10. Meanwhile, the limited indie release ""Sunshine Cleaning,"" starring Emily Blunt and Amy Adams, scored the highest opening-weekend per-theater average thus far in 2009, dusting up a stellar average of $53,500 in four theaters in New York and Los Angeles. Overall, the box office was a little on the sluggish side, dropping nearly 17 percent from the same frame a year ago, when ""Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!"" was the big winner. Still, this is just the first ""down"" weekend in more than a month, which is comforting. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The Italian capital Rome was spared major damage Saturday as some of the heaviest flooding in the past century reached its peak without bursting the banks of the Tiber river. A rescue boat patrols the swollen River Tiber in central Rome early Friday. Italian Civil Protection officials said the river will take several days to return to normal levels but there was no longer a risk of flooding. Civil Protection teams were also coordinating the removal of two barges that crashed against bridges after breaking their moorings on Friday. Italian media report that last night a young man from Ireland fell in the Tiber, but his body has not been found yet. Hundreds of volunteers and officials had been deployed around Rome ahead of the flood's peak, while sandbags were lined up to contain any possible river overflow. Firefighters Thursday had to rescue dozens of motorists stranded in their cars. Because of the intense rain, the streets of some northern Rome neighborhoods were already flooded by water and covered in thick brown mud. One woman died near Rome early Thursday when her car was submerged by a wave of water and mud in an underpass. The body of a second victim was found in the southern region of Calabria after a bridge collapsed. Earlier this month, much of the Italian city of Venice was underwater as some of the heaviest floods for several decades burst the city's famed canal networks and inundated historic landmarks such as St. Mark's Square.","Flood waters subside in Rome .

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles police are searching for a serial killer dubbed the ""Grim Sleeper,"" who is thought to have killed 11 people. Alicia Alexander was one of the Grim Sleeper's victims in the 1980s. The killer, who police say murdered from 1985 to 2007, was nicknamed the Grim Sleeper because he seemed to take a break between homicides, police said. Authorities this week released a 9-1-1 tape recorded shortly after a killing in 1987, in the hope of producing clues. ""Yes ... I'd like to report a murder,"" an anonymous caller says on the tape. ""The guy that dropped her off was driving a white and blue Dodge van. He threw her out. ... He threw a gas tank on top of her. All that you can see sticking out is her feet.""  Watch the hunt for a serial killer » . Police found the scene just as the caller described and found the van. But they are still searching for the caller and members of the now-defunct church that owned the van. The killer is wanted in 11 deaths and another homicide attempt, police say. Detectives say they have the Grim Sleeper's DNA, and a $500,000 reward has been offered for information leading to an arrest and prosecution. The killer shot his victims, police said. Porter Alexander has waited two decades for the Grim Sleeper's arrest. His daughter Alicia Alexander became the Grim Sleeper's eighth victim in 1988, police say.

Conjoined twins Hassan, left, and Mahmud rest the day before separation surgery in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. ""The twins' vital signs are good; they're doing excellent,"" said Sami Al-Shalan, spokesman for the King Abdulaziz Medical City facility in Riyadh where the surgery took place. ""The twins still have about 24 hours before a progress report can be issued. The anesthesia consultants are happy with the progress of the children.""

"(CNN) -- The chief executive of American Airlines, which has grounded almost 2,500 flights over the past three days, accepted ""full responsibility"" Thursday for failing to meet government inspection standards. ""I am profoundly sorry that we've gotten ourselves into this situation, and I thank our customers for their patience under very difficult circumstances,"" American CEO Gerard Arpey said Thursday afternoon. The airline canceled 933 flights on MD-80 jets Thursday and announced  570 would be scrapped Friday. Potential wiring hazards in wheel wells that could cause fires or problems with landing gear prompted the action. American canceled several hundred flights for the same reason about two weeks ago. Earlier Thursday, American said it expected all of its MD-80 jets to be flight-worthy by Saturday night. The airline has offered to make amends to travelers with refunds, vouchers and compensation for overnight stays. The cancellations have delayed and stranded more than 140,000 passengers. Roger Frizzell, an airline spokesman, said the inspections involve technical compliance as opposed to flight safety.  Watch how air travelers deal with disruptions » . Although American was most affected by the inspections, the Federal Aviation Administration's orders for safety checks have also affected Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Alaska Airlines and Midwest Airlines, which was the latest airline to ground planes: 13 on Thursday. The FAA launched its inspection campaign in March, after CNN obtained documents given to congressional investigators that showed more than 100 Southwest aircraft had not had mandatory safety inspections.   At a Capitol Hill hearing Thursday, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration's safety division, Nicholas Sabatini, was told that his agency's performance was woeful. ""I think [it's] approaching losing the confidence of the American people and the Congress,"" said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia. Lawmakers said the agency has become too close to the airline industry. Sabatini defended the FAA's record but said any lapse was cause for concern. ""We found we had achieved 99 percent safety compliance,"" he told lawmakers. But, he added, ""It's the other 1 percent that keeps me up at night."" Passengers scheduled to fly on an American Airlines MD-80 between Tuesday and Friday can receive a full refund or apply the value of their ticket to a future flight, the airline said. People who stayed overnight as a result of a canceled flight can go to the company's Web site to inquire about receiving compensation. Arpey said that the MD-80 has been a great plane for American Airlines and that the inspection problems should have ""no impact on our long-term fleet plan."" ""The FAA is stepping up their surveillance and doing their job,"" Arpey said. ""In this case, we failed to get it right, and we're trying very hard to get it right."" He said American plans to hire an independent consultant to examine the company's inspection system. Meanwhile, airports are doing their best to keep frustrated travelers happy. ""Getting stuck at the airport is not like a day at the beach, but we sure are trying to make passengers as comfortable as possible,"" said Ken Capps, vice president of public affairs for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas. Eateries were staying open all night, some provided free pastries and coffee, and some even handed out diapers. The situation at American's hub at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, ""was what you might see on a normal Thursday morning,"" CNN's Susan Roesgen reported. American employees handing out free coffee and granola bars found few takers.  Watch a report from O'Hare » .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- U.S.-led forces captured two men believed to be senior al Qaeda in Iraq leaders, including one suspected of planning the 2006 kidnapping of U.S. journalist Jill Carroll, a military statement said. Jill Carroll, seen here in an interview following her 2006 release, was held for nearly three months in Iraq. Coalition forces captured the suspects in Baghdad on August 11 and 17, according to the statement. The suspects were identified as Salim Abdallah Ashur al-Shujayri, also known as Abu Uthman, and Ali Rash Nasir Jiyad al-Shammari, also known as Abu Tiba. Abu Uthman is suspected of masterminding Carroll's abduction, the statement said. Carroll, a freelance reporter for The Christian Science Monitor, was abducted in January 2006 and freed unharmed in March of that year. Both men are suspected of overseeing car or suicide bombings targeting Iraqis with the intent of inciting sectarian violence, the statement said. Abu Tiba is suspected to have been in charge of as many 15 al Qaeda in Iraq ""attack cells,"" providing them with money, weapons and explosives, according to the statement.

"(CNN) -- An Austrian man who allegedly held his daughter as a sex slave for 24 years has been charged with murdering one of their children, prosecutors say. Josef Fritzl is accused of fathering seven children by his daughter during her 24-year captivity. Austrian State Prosecutor Gerhard Sedlacek told CNN Thursday that Josef Fritzl, 73, was charged with murder because one of the seven children died in infancy. The other six children survived. Fritzl, a retired electrician from Amstetten, 75 kilometers (46 miles) west of Vienna, was also charged with rape, incest, false imprisonment and slavery. The murder charge stems from the death of Fritzl's infant son, Michael Fritzl, who died from lack of medical care, the prosecutor said.  Watch as Fritzl is charged with murder » . ""Although he realized how life-threatening M.F.'s situation was after being born, Josef F. did not call out for help,"" Sedlacek said, explaining the charge. The trial is expected to begin early in 2009 and if convicted of murder Fritzl could face 10 to 20 years in prison. Austria, like other European countries, has no death penalty. Prosecutors say psychiatric tests show that Fritzl is mentally fit to stand trial but Sedlacek has asked that Fritzl be confined to a ""mental asylum."" Fritzl kept the daughter and all but three of the children in a cellar beneath his home in Amstetten, Austria, west of Vienna, officials say. Three of the children lived upstairs in the home Fritzl shared with his wife and several of their own children. Fritzl has been in custody since the case came to light in April, sparking worldwide attention. He had explained Elizabeth's disappearance in 1984 by saying the 18-year-old girl had run away from home, a story backed up by letters he forced Elisabeth to write, including one that begged her parents not to look for her. When Elizabeth gained her freedom, she told police her father began sexually abusing her at age 11. On August 8, 1984 -- weeks before she was reported missing -- her father enticed her into the basement, where he drugged her, put her in handcuffs and locked her in a room, she told police. For the next 24 years, she was constantly raped by her father, resulting in seven children, she said, according to the police statement. Fritzl's daughter and her children have since been receiving counseling although doctors warn that they will take years to recover. Members of the Fritzl family will also be offered the chance to adopt new identities in an effort to help them lead normal lives, officials said. Psychiatrist Max Friedrich, who treated the abducted Austrian teenager Natascha Kampusch, estimated it would take ""between five and eight years"" for the children to recover from their experiences.","Austrian man who allegedly held daughter for 24 years charged with murder .

"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Efforts by government troops to secure control of a main highway that links mainland Sri Lanka to the northern Jaffna peninsula came a step closer Thursday when they re-captured Pallai, a palm-fringed village under rebel control. Sri Lankan army troops have had there most decisive victories against the Tamil Tigers in recent weeks. The village is located past Elephant Pass, described as a gateway to the Jaffna peninsula, which the army re-captured on Wednesday. Whilst a column of troops are moving northwards from this town, another column that advanced from the outer fringes of the government-controlled peninsula advanced southwards to recapture Pallai. ""When the two columns meet we would have captured the entire A-9 highway,"" a senior army source told CNN. He spoke on grounds of anonymity since he is not authorized to talk to media. The A-9 highway links the hill city Kandy with Jaffna. The only stretch that remains to be recaptured is the area between Elephant Pass and Jaffna. Earlier this month, President Mahinda Rajapaksa urged the Tamil Tigers to lay down their arms and end a quarter-century of civil war. Before he made that request government troops retook the separatists' former capital, Kilinochchi. Rajapaksa called the recapture of Kilinochchi ""a victory against separatism."" ""The time is not far off when people of the north can breathe freedom again,"" Rajapaksa said. He invited the Tigers -- who have fought for an independent homeland for Sri Lanka's ethnic Tamil minority since 1983 -- to surrender as government troops closed in on their last remaining strongholds. The civil war has left more than 65,000 people dead. The U.S. State Department has designated the Tamil Tigers a terrorist organization.","Sri Lankan government troops continue advance into rebel territory .

"(CNN) -- An apartment left untouched since before the fall of the Berlin Wall has been discovered by a developer in the eastern German city of Leipzig, German media reports said Thursday. The fall of the Berlin Wall heralded the end of the communist regime in East Germany in 1989. The discovery, made by architect Mark Aretz, revealed a small one-bedroom apartment evidently abandoned quickly by its occupants as the Communist East German state disintegrated in 1989, Spiegel Online reported. A wall calendar showed August 1988, and the kitchen cupboard and drawers contained plastic crockery and aluminium cutlery along with communist-era food brands such as ""Vita"" Cola, ""Marella"" margarine, ""Juwel"" cigarettes and a bottle of ""Kristall"" vodka. ""When we opened the door we felt like Howard Carter when he found the grave of Tutankhamen,"" Aretz told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. ""Everything was a mess but it was like a historic treasure trove, a portal into an age long gone."" According to Aretz -- a developer who renovates properties in eastern Germany -- the occupant appears to have been a 24-year-old man from Leipzig who had been in trouble with the authorities, judging by personal documents left behind. The most recent document was dated May, 1989 -- a police search warrant for a caravan. There was also a stamped and addressed postcard written by the occupant, but he had never sent it, Spiegel said.","Apartment found by developer in eastern German city of Leipzig .

"GLEN BURNIE, Maryland (CNN) -- At his GM dealership in suburban Washington, Maury Wilkins exudes calm as he gears up for an enormous challenge: protecting his decades-old family business. Zero-percent financing is one way Maury Wilkins and other GM dealers are trying to lure new buyers. With General Motors teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, Wilkins says luring customers back into his showroom boils down to two factors. ""Everything is confidence and perception,"" Wilkins told CNN in a recent interview. Confidence in the beleaguered General Motors Corp. is exactly what President Obama hopes to restore. Even as he forced out GM's CEO Rick Wagoner in late March, the president also made an extraordinary pledge. ""If you buy a car from Chrysler or General Motors, you will be able to get your car serviced and repaired, just like always,"" Obama announced from the White House a week ago. ""Starting today, the United States government will stand behind your warranty,"" the president said. Some critics have blasted that promise as untenable. ""That's pie-in-the-sky,"" says William Holstein, author of ""Why GM Matters: Inside the Race to Transform an American Icon."" ""If General Motors goes away, how is the government ever going to maintain the network of suppliers?"" asks Holstein. Noting there are ""four or five thousand moving parts in a vehicle,"" Holstein wonders, ""How is the government going to maintain this incredible infrastructure of suppliers to make sure that every part, every body panel is available for years after General Motors goes away?... It's impossible."" GM dealer Wilkins sees the government's guarantee as a consumer confidence-builder. Still, he's concerned about slumping sales figures. Nationwide, auto sales dropped 37 percent in March compared with a year ago. Wilkins' business was not immune. Though he says he's not in crisis mode, he does have contingency plans.  Watch report from CNN's Elaine Quijano on Wilkins » . ""Our business model is 'what if, what if, what if,'"" Wilkins said, adding, ""if all these things are outside of our control, how do we make sure that we maintain our profitability?"" That means extra attention to facets of his business besides new-car sales, including used-car sales, service and parts, and collision repair. Already, Wilkins believes car sales have turned a corner. He says February was one of his dealership's best months. It was the result, he believes, of business adjustments he made, including altering inventory stocks. Wilkins also says credit for car buyers is finally beginning to loosen. Potential customer Jim Lally says that's what drew him into the showroom the day CNN visited. ""I heard about the zero-percent financing and the exceptional deals that are being offered right now,"" Lally said. While Lally hadn't decided on whether to buy a GM, his visit was another reason for Wilkins' cautious optimism, as his business tries to weather the economic storm.","Suburban Washington GM dealer Maury Wilkins trying to lure back customers .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- President Obama mixed jokes with serious discussion Thursday during an appearance on ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno."" President Obama chats it up with Jay Leno on ""The Tonight Show"" on Thursday. While presidential candidates have used comedy shows for campaigning as far back as Richard Nixon's performance on ""Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In"" in 1968, Obama became the first sitting president to appear before a late-night talk show studio audience. Obama complimented guitarist Kevin Eubanks on his suit, and he cracked jokes about the Secret Service and ""American Idol"" host Simon Cowell. Obama also remarked on his poor bowling skills, which were evident during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania. He told Leno that he bowled 129 in the White House bowling alley and said his bowling skills are ""like Special Olympics or something."" Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton said the president's remarks were not meant to poke fun of the Special Olympics. ""The president made an offhand remark making fun of his own bowling that was in no way intended to disparage the Special Olympics,"" Burton said. ""He thinks that the Special Olympics are a wonderful program that gives an opportunity to shine to people with disabilities from around the world."" Obama later moved on to topical discussions of the economic crisis and the AIG bonus scandal.  Watch some of Obama's appearance » . ""The problem with AIG was that it owed so much and was tangled up with so many banks and institutions that if you had allowed it to just liquidate, to go into bankruptcy, it could have brought the whole financial system down. So it was the right thing to do to intervene in AIG,"" Obama said. Obama said earlier this week that he'll ""take responsibility"" for AIG executives receiving those controversial bonuses -- roughly $165 million -- while the company took $173 billion in government bailouts. Congress is looking for ways to recoup all or some of that money. ""The larger problem is we've got to get back to an attitude where people know enough is enough, and people have a sense of responsibility and they understand that their actions are going to have an impact on everybody,"" he said. ""If we can get back to those values that built America, then I think we're going to be OK."" Obama also said he was confident in his embattled Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. ""I think Geithner is doing an outstanding job. I think that we have a big mess on our hands,"" he said. ""It's not going to be solved immediately, but it is going to get solved."" Obama taped the show Thursday afternoon during a two-day swing through the Los Angeles area for town hall meetings focusing on the economy. iReport.com: Nice to see the ""real"" Obama . Obama also discussed the ""life in the bubble,"" musing over how Secret Service agents would not let him walk 750 yards from Air Force One to the Costa Mesa fairgrounds, where some of the day's activities were to take place. Obama said flying in Air Force One is ""pretty cool,"" especially because ""they give you the jacket with the [presidential] seal on it,"" he said. The only time Leno appeared to stop Obama in his tracks was when he asked the president whether he thought people intentionally lose basketball games when they play with him. ""I don't see why they would throw the game, except for all those Secret Service guys with guns around,"" he said. There's some political risk for Obama, according to Washington Post media columnist Howard Kurtz, who also hosts CNN's ""Reliable Sources."" AC360 blog: Laughing through the pain . ""He has to be very careful about his tone, because if he yuks it up too much and seems to be having too good a time, it will be quite a contrast there with the pain the people are feeling with the crumbling economy,"" Kurtz said.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Up to 30,000 additional U.S. troops could be sent to Afghanistan next year, military officials said Saturday. Helicopters are the main transportation of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, with its high mountain terrain. Roughly 31,000 U.S. troops currently are in Afghanistan. Of the additional troops, 20,000 will comprise four ground/maneuvering brigades, said Col. Gregory Julian, spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. That number is consistent with what Gen. David McKiernan, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, called for in October, he said. The additional 10,000 likely refers to support personnel, Julian said. McKiernan requested the additional 20,000 troops be sent to fight the increasing violence by the resurgent Taliban forces in the southern and eastern parts of the country. On Friday, military officials said Defense Secretary Robert Gates signed a deployment order to move an additional 3,000 troops to Afghanistan next year. Those troops will be part of a combat aviation brigade, the latest approved by Gates for the expected buildup of U.S. troops in the country in 2009. The brigade will send a number of much-needed helicopters to the region. Helicopters are the main mode of transportation for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, where high mountain roads and passes make it difficult for large transport vehicles to move troops and supplies. The additional troops would nearly double the level of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Troop levels are likely to be maintained at this increased level for three to four years, Julian said Saturday, as U.S. forces continue to try to ""clear and hold"" more parts of Afghanistan from insurgents and militants and train Afghan military and police to be self-sufficient.","20,000 in four ground/maneuvering brigades, said U.S. forces spokesman .

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II reflected Thursday on the economic and political crises sweeping the globe, acknowledging in her Christmas Day message their impact on holiday festivities. Queen Elizabeth II attends a Christmas Day service at Sandringham in Norfolk, England. ""Christmas is a time for celebration, but this year it is a more somber occasion for many. Some of those things which could once have been taken for granted suddenly seem less certain, and naturally give rise to feelings of insecurity,"" she told Britons in a televised appearance from Buckingham Palace. ""People are touched by events which have their roots far across the world -- whether it is the global economy or violence in a distant land, the effects can be keenly felt at home."" In her nine-minute message, she encouraged Britons to look for happiness and courage through helping others, and singled out World War I veterans and current troops in Iraq and Afghanistan as examples of courage and sacrifice. Military veterans of the First World War recently commemorated the ""service and enormous sacrifice of their own generation,"" the queen said. The families of soldiers now serving overseas carry an extra burden of worry while they are away, she added. ""In such times as these, we can all learn some lessons from the past. We might begin to see things in a new perspective, and certainly we begin to ask ourselves where it is that we can find lasting happiness.""  Watch excerpts of the queen's address » . It appears, she noted, that people who seem most contented and fulfilled are ""the people who have lived the most outgoing and unselfish lives -- the kind of people who are generous with their talents or their time ... those who use their prosperity or good fortune for the benefit of others."" ""When life seems hard, the courageous do not lie down and accept defeat. Instead, they are all the more determined to struggle for a better future,"" the queen said. ""I think we have a huge amount to learn from individuals such as these."" She expressed pride in her son, Prince Charles, who turned 60 last month and is one of the longest-serving heirs to the throne. He was baptized in the music room where the queen spoke, she said. Several clips -- including a few with the queen playing with Charles, as a toddler -- were shown throughout her comments. Charles has helped and supported young people through various charities, and his sons, princes William and Harry, are following his lead, the queen said. She closed her message with references to Jesus Christ, who she said lived an unselfish and sacrificial life, despite circumstances of great adversity. ""He makes it clear that genuine human happiness and satisfaction lie more in giving than receiving, more in serving than in being served.

"(CNN) -- Radical Islamist fighters seized control of the seat of Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government Monday, raiding the parliament building and demanding that several lawmakers publicly surrender, according to a journalist who witnessed the spectacle. Members of the Somali Transitional Federal Parliament are meeting in the neighboring country of Djibouti. Al-Shabab fighters took over the parliament building and the presidential palace in Baidoa, in the southwestern part of the country, a day after the Ethiopian troops who had backed up the transitional government left the country. The insurgents captured five members of parliament and paraded them through the city streets, with hundreds of residents looking on, the reporter said. The five were released after publicly surrendering. The situation left Somali lawmakers stranded in the neighboring country of Djibouti, where they often convene and where talks on forming a new government are under way. ""We have nowhere to return to,"" Parliament Speaker Aden Mohamed Nur told fellow lawmakers there. Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government took office after Ethiopian troops invaded the country at its request in December 2006. The Ethiopian invasion ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamist movement that had claimed control of the capital Mogadishu earlier that year. Ethiopia's invasion had the blessing of the United States, which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda. But various Islamist groups -- including the hard-line Al-Shabab, which the United States has designated a terror organization -- rejected the presence of Ethiopian forces and mounted an insurgent campaign against the Ethiopians and the transitional government. Ethiopia announced on Sunday that all its forces have left Somalia. Last week, as Ethiopian troops began pulling out of the Somali capital, forces from different Islamist groups -- including Al-Shabab -- took control of bases the Ethiopians abandoned around Mogadishu. The transitional government maintained very little control outside of Baidoa, even with the support of the Ethiopian forces. It has also been wracked by an internal power struggle between Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein and President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, who resigned in December. In Washington, the State Department said U.S. officials are working to independently confirm the reports from Baidoa. But State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said members of one of the major Islamic factions, which signed a peace agreement in October in Djibouti, are already joining the transitional government. Duguid said the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, another offshoot of the ICU, will choose up to 200 new members of the transitional parliament. Another 75 members will be drawn from other opposition groups, and the expanded parliament is expected to elect a new president soon. ""We remain deeply concerned about the ongoing violence in southern Somalia, which continues to claim innocent lives,"" Duguid said. ""Lasting peace and stability in Somalia can only be established through the reconciliation process underway through the Djibouti Agreement and rejection of extremism."" With Monday's takeover of Baidoa, the transitional government only has control of the presidential palace in the Somali capital of Mogadishu and the road to the airport in the capital city, which it holds with the help of African Union forces. CNN's Ben Brumfield and journalists Mohamed Amiin Adow and Omar Faruk Osman contributed to this report.","Islamist fighters seize control of Baidoa, Somalia .

"(CNN) -- The World Bank cut China's economic growth forecast in 2009 to 6.5 percent Wednesday, down a full percentage point from November's projection. Workers assemble toys on a production line at a factory in Shantou, in China's Guangdong province. Despite the downgrade, ""China is a relative bright spot in an otherwise gloomy global economy,"" said the World Bank's David Dollar. Last week, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao reiterated projections that the nation's economy will grow by 8 percent in 2009, despite doubts expressed by domestic and international economic analysts. Some have forecast growth as low as 5 percent. ""I will admit it will be a difficult job [to reach 8 percent]. This being said, I also believe with considerable efforts it's possible for us to obtain this goal,"" Wen said at a news conference following the annual session of the country's rubber-stamp legislature. China has seen a sharp decline in demand for its exports since November as other major economies have struggled. In February, Chinese exports plunged 25.7 percent compared with the previous year's, Beijing reported last week. Even with the slowdown, China's economy -- the third largest in the world -- has gone from white-hot to merely robust. In 2007, China's gross domestic product grew at 13 percent. The two largest economies -- the United States and Japan -- are in recession. ""So a lot of things will go down in 2009 globally,"" Dollar said. ""But we see China's contribution as being very positive in keeping many markets from going down as far as they would otherwise."" The World Bank expects China's economy to outgrow most others in 2009. In November, China announced plans to inject $586 billion (4 trillion yuan) into its economy to offset declines in industrial and export growth. That economic stimulus plan included the loosening of credit restrictions, tax cuts and massive infrastructure spending.","World Bank cuts China's economic growth forecast in 2009 to 6.5 percent .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Playing the Nintendo Wii Fit could improve balance and help avoid falls in seniors, researchers taking part in a new study suggest. Researchers in Aberdeen think playing Wii Fit may improve the elderly's balance and lower risks of falling. The University of Aberdeen, Scotland and the UK's National Health Service (NHS) have embarked on a four month study on people over 70 to observe any changes in balance after regular use of the Wii Fit. The video game has different activities including yoga poses, push ups, strength, balance and aerobic exercises. The Wii Fit includes a balance board that records movements and gives feedback on performance. Dr Marie Fraser, a specialist registrar at Woodend Hospital in Scotland, UK, is carrying out the research. She told CNN: ""Falls are the most common cause of accidental injury in older people and the most common cause of accidental deaths in 75-year-olds and over."" It is hoped that using the Wii Fit's balance board can improve elderly people's balance and confidence. Dr Alison Stewart, who devised the study said she came up with the idea while working in the Osteoporosis department at the University of Aberdeen, after seeing a large number of fractures in old people who had fallen. Stewart, a commercial research manager with the NHS, said she then decided to research how to improve older people's balance. She told CNN: ""There exists a medical fitness device that improves balance, but it is expensive and I could not get the funding. ""That's when I looked up the Wii and discovered it is very similar to the other equipment, but less expensive. ""What is great about the Wii is it also has an entertainment value. The fact that it is enjoyable also makes the compliance rate higher."" The latest study comes as another pilot study at Southern Cross University, Australia looked at the  benefits of using the Wii to help Parkinson's sufferers. A group of seven older people with and without the degenerative condition took part in the pilot project, and were put through an almost daily regime of playing the Nintendo Wii. Associate Professor Rick van der Zwan who led the research said initial results were ""positive."" They ultimately hope to determine the effectiveness of computer games in developing muscle strength and co-ordination and reducing the risk of falls for people with Parkinson's. ""People generally start to develop the disease in their 50s or 60s. It leads to inertia and people become unstable on their feet,"" said Van der Zwan in a media statement. ""What we are trying to do is reduce the risk of serious harm. These people are nine times more likely to fall over than someone without the disease and falls in this older age group can be very serious."" Van der Zwan now wants to recruit 15 more research participants to broaden the study. Since its launch in 2006 the Nintendo Wii has seen a huge rise in the number of elderly players. At one senior citizen home in north-east England, staff introduced the popular games console at Christmas in all five of its homes. ""Everyone loves it and we noticed it has improved the physical fitness of residents who play,"" Rachel Todd of McArdle Care told CNN. Todd believes the device's entertainment value not only improves residents' fitness levels, but also their mental fitness. Among the Wii Fit fans at the home are 74-year-old Ian Fisher and 86-year-old Betty Dennis. ""I always loved sports, particularly football"" Dennis told CNN. ""But I had a stroke six months ago and am now in a wheelchair."" ""Since the Wii I really feel movement in my right arm has improved, which is all I need to play skittles."" Her bowling partner Fisher told CNN he recently played the boxing game on Wii Fit with his four-year-old great-grandson. ""It really spans all ages, although my great-grandson knocked me out twice,"" the former bricklayer said.","Researchers study whether Wii Fit can can improve older people's balance .

"(CNN) -- South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford declared a state of emergency Thursday for a coastal county where a wildfire has consumed thousands of acres and destroyed dozens of homes. Scott Vereen sprays water on his family's home Thursday near Conway, South Carolina. ""This has already proved to be a devastating event for Horry County, and it isn't over,"" Sanford said in a written statement. The county includes some of the state's most popular tourist spots, including the Myrtle Beach area. By late afternoon, however, officials in North Myrtle Beach said the fire there was mostly contained. ""The fire is very contained on our end right now,"" said the city's director of public safety, William Bailey. ""We have hot spots. I would say we're about 75 to 80 percent [contained]."" But as he gestured toward the dark clouds behind him, he told people who had been evacuated: ""As you see with the smoke and activity behind us, we still got some issues that we're concerned about. We're doing everything we can to get you home."" Authorities began alerting people in the city's Barefoot Resort area early Thursday after the fire jumped a highway and began consuming some houses. As of about 6 p.m. ET Thursday, the fire had consumed 15,500 acres, destroyed 69 homes and damaged 100 others, according to the Horry County Emergency Operations Center. While no fatalities or injuries were reported, some 2,500 people have been evacuated, officials said. About 440 people were in two shelters at the House of Blues and at the North Myrtle Beach Aquatic Center, the operations center said. Both the Barefoot Resort and the Pelican Bay subdivisions had been evacuated. In addition, three schools were evacuated because of heavy smoke. Eight vehicles had been destroyed as of Thursday afternoon, said Mayor Marilyn Hatley.  Watch footage of coastal areas in flames » . Bailey said authorities were hopeful the weather would continue to cooperate. Low humidity had persisted for most of the day. ""We have the resources, we just need to get a weather break,"" he said. Authorities said the fire has been unpredictable. ""When we got our last report [Wednesday], we had no idea that it would be crossing over into the Barefoot Resort area,"" Hatley said at the morning news conference. ""The fire kind of created its own weather, and it just started the wind spinning."" Nick Gentile, 64, told The Myrtle Beach Sun News that he left his Barefoot Resort home around 2 a.m. Thursday. ""They came around with a police car with a loudspeaker,"" he told the newspaper, still wearing his blue-plaid pajamas. ""You always read about stuff like this, but you never know when you are going to be in it."" Helicopters were conducting water drops over portions of the area, Hatley said. The National Weather Service issued a dense smoke advisory for the county until 3 a.m. Friday. Thick plumes billowed high above buildings, prompting North Myrtle Beach school officials to close school Thursday, CNN affiliate WPDE-TV reported. Officials have not determined a cause for the fire, which began about noon Wednesday in Conway.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Shortly after midnight on January 24, a 16-year old boy from Powder Springs, Georgia, crashed his car into an oncoming vehicle. Garrett Reed, a star football player at Harrison High School, died instantly. Police believe he had been drinking. Kecia Evangela Whitfield, 43, is charged with furnishing alcohol to a minor and reckless conduct. According to police, the investigation revealed that a classmate's mother served alcohol to Reed. Police charged 43-year-old Kecia Evangela Whitfield with furnishing alcohol to a minor and reckless conduct, both misdemeanors. Whitfield was released on a $10,000 bond and awaits a court date in April. Records on file with the Cobb County solicitor general's office indictate she has not yet entered a plea or obtained a lawyer. She did not return CNN's phone calls. If convicted, she could receive up to a year in jail and fines totaling thousands of dollars. Toxicology reports for Reed will be released in six weeks, officials said. His death stunned the small community of Powder Springs and sounded an alarm for parents. ""What we have to realize is that our kids do think they are invincible,"" said Patti Agatston, a mother of another Harrison High School teenager who lives in Reed's neighborhood. ""We can't be enablers. We've got to be adults and say 'no.' "" At least ten states including Virginia, Minnesota and New Mexico-and Georgia, where Garrett's accident occurred, allow parents to give their own child alcohol, according to the Alcohol Policy Information System, a federal website that tracks alcohol laws. The alcohol can typically be given to the minor in the guardian's home or a private setting and there are no age limits, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. However, nowhere is it legal to give alcohol to other people's children. Officials say teen binge drinking is reaching epidemic proportions, and states and municipalities are scrambling to implement ""social hosting"" laws that carry stiff fines for parents whose homes are used for drinking parties, whether they know about them or not. At least 24 states have enacted social hosting laws that fine parents several thousand dollars for each offense, said Jim Mosher, an expert tracking alcohol policies at the National Conference of State Legislatures. The fines, he said, are an effective deterrent. A 2005 study conducted by the American Medical Association reported that about one-third of teens said it was ""easy to obtain alcohol"" from their parents. That figure jumps to 40 percent when it comes to getting alcohol from a friend's parent. One out of four teens said they had attended a party where minors were drinking in front of parents. Some communities are using their zoning powers to create local social hosting laws. These laws usually result in misdemeanor charges and jail time is rare. Prosecutors' offices are often busy with other cases and don't bother to charge unless there is a serious incident or accident, policy experts said. ""It's very difficult for us to knock on a random door and say 'are you drinking?' "" said Sgt. Dana Pierce of the Cobb County Police Department, the agency responsible for investigating Reed's case. ""We usually have to respond to some kind of nuisance call."" In Massachusetts in January, a court sentenced a mother to jail for serving alcohol to minors at a party in her home. A teenage boy died in an auto accident after leaving her party. In Charlottesville, Virginia, two adults served jail time in 2007 for providing alcohol at their son's 16th birthday party. Some parents consider giving a teenager a drink a rite of passage -- and that contributes to high teenage drinking rates, said Richard Yoast, director of the Department of Healthy Lifestyles and Primary Prevention at the American Medical Association. ""It's a myth that adults and children are buying into, and it creates pressure on the child to drink,"" Yoast said. ""The biggest problem to overcome is the fact that parents feel like they are helping their kids,"" said Denise Thames, director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving in Georgia, ""They often forget they are in fact breaking the law."" The affluent suburbs near Powder Springs, where Reed's accident took place, are not immune. Police say there were several teenagers hanging out with Reed the night he died, including Whitfield's stepson. Several of Reed's close friends at Harrison High School said alcohol is easy to get in their community and students can find a drinking party each weekend if they want to. It is easier to get alcohol from older friends and relatives or parents than buying it with a fake ID, they said. ""As long as you have money, you can get it,"" said Eric Stallworth, a senior at Harrison High School, who was close friends with Reed. He described his friend as a charismatic and popular boy, who was fiercely competitive when it came to sports and dreamed of playing college football. While there is no county or city ordinance on social hosting in Powder Springs, or in Georgia, some parents are fighting back. The Cobb Alcohol Task Force, which also serves Powder Springs, is a volunteer group working to reduce teens' access to alcohol. The group launched a campaign called ""Adults Who Host Lose the Most"" to educate the public about the dangers of illegally providing teens with liquor. Surveys in Cobb County show the campaigns are working slowly, said Cathy Finck, Cobb Alcohol Task Force coordinator. In 2007, 68 percent of 10th grade students said obtaining alcohol was easy, a decrease from 73 percent the previous year. But that may not be enough to stop a fatal accident such as Reed's. ""Unless you get everyone to do it, kids will find out one place where they can get alcohol and you will have these kinds of incidences,"" Finck said. ""Everyone has to get on board."" Ultimately, parents need to step up and take responsibility, said Shawna Snapp of Blue River, Oregon. Her son, Ryan Snapp, nicknamed ""Snapper,"" died two years ago in a car accident. He was 17 and the teenage driver had been drinking alcohol obtained from an adult. ""We're not here as parents to be their best friends,"" Snapp said. ""We are here to guide them for life.""","Star football player dies in crash that followed night of drinking .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The photograph is a jarring image that shows Nazi Party members, shovels in hand, digging up graves of American soldiers held as slaves by Nazi Germany during World War II. Members of the Nazi Party are forced to dig up mass graves of U.S. soldiers while American GIs look on. While the men dig up the site, U.S. soldiers investigating war crimes stand over them. Two crosses with helmets placed atop them -- the sign of a fallen soldier -- are visible. Two Germans are knee deep in mud. Another, with a handlebar mustache, has the look of a defeated man. The bodies of 22 American soldiers were found in at least seven graves, according to the photographer. On the back of the photo is written, ""Nazi Party members digging up American bodies at Berga.""   Berga an der Elster was a slave labor camp where 350 U.S. soldiers were beaten, starved, and forced to work in tunnels for the German government. The soldiers were singled out for ""looking like Jews"" or ""sounding like Jews,"" or dubbed as undesirables, according to survivors. More than 100 soldiers perished at the camp or on a forced death march. It was on this day six decades ago, April 23, 1945, when most of the slave labor camp soldiers were liberated by advancing U.S. troops. The emaciated soldiers, many weighing just 80 pounds, had been forced by Nazi commanders to march more than 150 miles before their rescue.  Watch survivor break down in tears over liberation » . The new photograph was likely taken in May or June 1945 when U.S. war crimes investigators combed Berga. It was donated earlier this month to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum by Jim Martin and his family, whose father, Elmore ""Bud"" Martin, is believed to have snapped the picture as part of the war crimes investigation team. The photo and dozens of others sat for years in Jim Martin's closet. Some of the photos, including graphic images of American corpses, were placed on record at the National Archives years ago.  See shocking photos of the slave camp » . But the image of Nazi Party members digging up graves doesn't appear to be part of that collection. Martin said he was proud to hand over the photos. ""People have to see these. This is something that's history and it belongs with something that's historical to tell that story. It doesn't belong in my closet."" ""To be honest, I'm kind of sorry I haven't done it sooner. We didn't realize what it was."" Elmore Martin, who won a Silver Star for his valor in capturing images during the war, was 28 when he shot the photographs. Before the war, he worked as a photographer for the St. Paul Dispatch and Pioneer Press. Martin's son said his dad, who died several years ago, struggled to keep a job when he returned home. ""I now see where it all started,"" he said. What Elmore Martin and the war crimes soldiers seen in the photo couldn't have known that day was how the case would evolve. The two Berga commanders -- Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz -- were tried for war crimes and initially sentenced to die by hanging. But the U.S. government commuted their death sentences in 1948, and both men were eventually released in the 1950s. One other Berga commander, Lt. Willy Hack, was executed, but not by the United States. He died by hanging, justice carried out by the Soviets. Jim Martin said his father would have been upset at the freeing of the Berga commanders after the atrocities he documented. ""He knew it happened and to see that these people were released would be pretty devastating."" Efraim Zuroff, who has spent nearly 30 years hunting Nazis responsible for the Holocaust, said the U.S. government commuted the sentences and freed hundreds of war criminals like those at Berga after the war, as the Cold War began to intensify. ""They were more concerned about keeping out Communists than admitting victims of the Nazis,"" he said. ""The realities out there were very conducive of letting these people off the hook."" How should Americans feel six decades later that the government freed the Nazi commanders responsible for atrocities against U.S. soldiers? ""We're supposed to feel very pissed off about that, to be perfectly honest, and that feeling is very justified,"" Zuroff said. The German government has since made reparations to the soldiers held at Berga. Zuroff said now it's time for the U.S. government to do ""the right thing."" ""To apologize,"" he said. The Army said it is trying to figure out the best way to honor the Berga soldiers. There are about 20 known survivors still living. ""The U.S. Army honors the service and sacrifice of all veterans who have fought our nation's wars. The Army is working to identify the most dignified and personal way to honor the soldiers held at the Nazi slave camp, known as Berga,"" Army spokesman Lt. Col. Willie Harris said in a written statement. The Army refused to answer further questions about the Berga case.  Listen in as an elderly man learns about his brother's death at the camp » . Survivors have long wanted to know why the sentences of the commanders were commuted. In a letter dated June 11, 1948, to an attorney whose nephew died at Berga, the U.S. War Department said the sentences of Metz and Merz were commuted because they were ""underlings."" The letter goes on to say that Metz ""though guilty of a generally cruel course of conduct toward prisoners was not directly responsible for the death of any prisoners, except one who was killed during the course of an attempt to escape."" That soldier was Morton Goldstein. Survivors say Goldstein tried to escape but was captured. They say Metz stood him against a wall, walked up to him and shot him, execution-style, through the head. As his body lay on the ground, guards riddled him with bullets, according to survivors. The soldiers who survived were not called to testify at the war crimes trial against Metz and Merz, instead prosecutors relied on about a dozen soldiers' statements gathered through the course of the investigation. At the trial, Metz blamed any deaths at the camp on U.S. medics. ""They bore the sole responsibility for the medical care,"" Metz told the court, according to the book ""Given Up for Dead,"" by Flint Whitlock, citing trial transcripts. ""I ask you: Who must bear the responsibility? The answer is obvious: The U.S. medics."" Those comments don't sit well with Berga survivors. ""He was terrible, absolutely terrible. He lied,"" said Tony Acevedo, a U.S. medic who catalogued the deaths in a diary at the camp. ""Everybody hated his guts."" ""Even the German guards were scared of him.""  Flip through Acevedo's diary from the slave camp » . Berga survivors say they await any recognition from the Army that may come, especially after all these years. Morton Brooks, 83, said he constantly thinks about the day he was liberated. He was rail thin and had walked by political prisoners shot in the head during the forced death march. In the final hours before his rescue, his attitude was, ""Let them kill us,"" he said. ""I think all the time that I'm a survivor of this and I'm still around,"" said Brooks. ""To me, it just amazes me. I don't know how I got through."" Jim Martin said he's still trying to process his father's role as a forgotten American war hero, armed not with a gun, but a camera. ""The worst part is I'm just finding it out,"" he said.","New photo surfaces of Nazi slave labor camp where U.S. soldiers held during WWII .

"(AOL Autos) -- The little two-passenger smart fortwo is the most fuel-efficient car (not counting hybrids) in the U.S. market, with EPA fuel economy ratings of 33 mpg city, 41 highway. For high-mileage frugality, it appears to beat the five-passenger Toyota Yaris and its 29/35-mpg ratings by a long shot. Look at the inside of your car's fuel door to find out whether you're required to use a certain octane gasoline. But wait! Premium fuel -- which cost about 12 percent more than regular at U.S. pumps last month -- is required for the fortwo. Suddenly the gap closes and the Smart no longer looks like as strong of a fuel-budget buster. And with the requirement, they mean it: smart says you'll lose your warranty coverage if you don't ante up. With premium fuel averaging about 24 cents more per gallon than regular, your choices at the pump can add up very quickly. If you drive a 20-mpg vehicle 15,000 miles a year, that's an extra $180, each year, toward those extra few octane points. If you have a thirstier truck or SUV or cover more mileage, it could amount to hundreds of dollars a year. New-car buyers, take notice. Add fuel requirements to your shopping checklist, because it will impact your wallet with every visit to the gas station, for years of ownership. The expensive stuff is typically recommended -- though not always required -- for luxury and high-performance cars, while less-expensive sedans, coupes, and SUVs only require 87-octane. But there are plenty of exceptions. Alan Hall, a spokesman for Ford, says that the automaker no longer has any models that require premium grade and only a few for which it's recommended. Regular unleaded is fine across all the models of Ford's Lincoln  luxury brand, says Hall, so ""as a luxury car buyer you don't have that added premium of premium fuel."" Ford now does all of its engine development and vehicle testing on 87-octane, regular-grade fuel. ""We don't want to give you a product that will have durability issues,"" explains Hall, if premium-grade isn't available everywhere. Another exception in the luxury-car realm is Hyundai; the automaker chose to tune the new high-performance V-8 engine in its Genesis sedan for premium fuel, but it also certified it for regular-grade. The automaker is the first to list power figures both with premium (375 hp) and regular (368 hp), letting owners opt for either top performance or a substantial savings at the pump. For the record, there's no measurable difference in fuel economy between the two grades, or any greater potential for damage, according to Hyundai. ""We wanted to give customers the choice,"" explained Hyundai spokesman Miles Johnson. ""If you want a few extra horsepower, go ahead and spend a little more at the pump."" Along with several European automakers, the BMW Group recommends premium fuel for all of its vehicles -- including the economical MINI Cooper -- yet Ford doesn't even recommend premium for its sporty, V-8-powered Mustang GT. The high-performance, 540-hp Shelby GT500 is the only new Ford vehicle to carry the recommendation for premium ... and Hall concedes the engine will get a ""slight boost"" from premium. Throwing money away? You might have been led to believe at some point that your vehicle will do better with premium, but with most newer vehicles, that's simply not true. Provided yours just calls for 87-octane, chances are you won't notice the difference, according to a number of experts, and you're essentially throwing the money away. The best way to tell, advises John Nielsen, director of AAA's Auto Repair and Buying Network, is to simply look at the inside of the fuel door; if it says, ""use premium fuel only,"" and specifies a higher octane number (regular is typically 87, premium is 91 or higher), then the expensive stuff is actually required for the vehicle. But for people with vehicles only requiring 87-octane, Nielsen advises, ""Don't do it; it's a waste of money."" Don't let the filthy images get to you either. If you've seen commercials for gasoline, you've likely heard that premium-grade will keep maintain your vehicle's full power and smoothness, and otherwise your valves and injectors will become clogged with 'gunk,' and you'll have to shoulder premature repairs. Typically, within the same brand of gasoline, between regular and premium, ""the difference is really just octane,"" confirms Prentiss Searles, Marketing Issues Manager at the American Petroleum Institute. To call a fuel regular, midgrade, or premium, Searles explains, only relates to octane; there's no other requirement that assures greater purity, more detergents, or better additives. Nielsen says that the emphasis on detergents and additives for premium fuels is also misleading because in most fuels you have plenty of detergents to keep modern computer-controlled engines clean. ""Unleaded is just fine,"" he insists. More drivers are discovering that. Last year, as gasoline prices crept past four dollars a gallon for regular grade and approached five dollars in some places for premium, many motorists with rapidly emptying wallets broke the premium habit and filled up their vehicle with regular for the first time. The market share of premium gas has been on a downward trend for many years -- going from 16.6 percent percent of U.S. sales in 1997 to just 9.5 percent in 2007, according to the Energy Information Administration -- and although 2008 data hasn't yet been released, it's anticipated that last year even more turned to the less-expensive nozzle. Pinging is a thing of the past . For cars made several decades ago, it was up to you to listen for deadly knocking or pinging sounds -- a sign that the fuel was prematurely detonating and could quickly cause damage to engine components. But since the 1980s, most vehicles have had knock sensors. These little microphones listen for the telltale 'ping' of early detonation and your car's electronics automatically retard ignition timing to smooth it out. You don't even need to worry that your knock sensors have broken, Nielsen says, because it would set off the 'check engine' light. The actual heat energy in gasoline is typically the same whether it's regular or premium, but the higher octane rating means it can burn in a more controlled fashion -- useful only if the engine can take advantage of it. ""Higher-octane gasoline doesn't make any more power, but it enables higher compression, or enables the turbochargers to produce more boost,"" says Nielsen. For vehicles that only require 87-octane, using a higher-octane fuel won't yield any noticeable difference from the driver's seat. It's a bit more complicated when premium is recommended. Look at the language in your owner's manual first, and if it mentions that regular is acceptable there will still likely be cautions of compromised performance; if it cautions against the regular use of regular you might be compromising your warranty. Honda spokesman Chris Martin advises against using regular for any vehicle for which premium is recommended. ""There could be some short-term knocking or pinging, but nothing lasting,"" he says. ""I wouldn't recommend it for the long term."" Nielsen, of AAA, adds that drivers of high-performance or luxury vehicles for which 91-octane is recommended might actually negate their savings with regular depending on their driving style, seeing lower fuel economy. In a lot of cases, Nielsen sums, the fuel specs are simply an engineering issue; the engine was designed and tested with premium fuel, and they didn't design it to run on premium -- although it might do just fine. If your car wasn't built with an appetite for premium, save yourself the money.","Fuel octane requirements can be found on inside of car's fuel door .

"(CNN) -- An estimated one percent of adults have active epilepsy, and many of them are getting insufficient treatment, according to a 19-state survey released Thursday. ""This is the first time that we actually have data from multiple states,"" said Rosemarie Kobau, lead author of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study, in a telephone interview. ""What we learned is that, among adults with active epilepsy, more than a third of them reported not seeing a specialist for their epilepsy, and that's really unacceptable."" A follow-up survey is planned to determine why so many people with seizure disorders said they had not seen a specialist in the past year, Kobau said. ""This is a highly specialized field,"" said Eric Hargis, the president and CEO of the Epilepsy Foundation, which collaborated with the authors of the study. ""It's not possible to get state-of-the-art care"" for the disorder from primary care doctors. One in six (16.1 percent) adults with active epilepsy with recent seizures said they were not taking their medication and two-thirds (65.1 percent) said they had had more than one seizure during the prior month. More than a fifth (20.4 percent) said cost was a barrier to seeking care from their doctor. Access to high-quality care is key to quality of life, Kobau said. People with recurrent seizures face substantial impairments in their daily activities; many are not allowed to drive and, as a result, depend on public transportation. In some areas, particularly rural ones, that can present a barrier to full participation in life, she said. That's not all. In addition to carrying stigma, people with epilepsy were more likely to live in households with the lowest annual incomes and to report being unemployed and unable to work. According to the 2005 findings, 1.65 percent of the population said they had been told by a doctor that they had epilepsy or a seizure disorder, the report said. Half of that group (0.84 percent) said they had active epilepsy -- defined as having had one or more seizures during the prior three months or currently taking medication. If the findings translate to the general population, that means a stadium filled with 60,000 people would contain 480 people with active epilepsy, Kobau noted, adding, ""Epilepsy is not rare."" But that view was disputed by Dr. James King, a family physician in Selmer, Tennessee, and president of the American Association of Family Physicians. ""There are patients that can be managed fairly simply with seizure disorder,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""In my own personal practice, I'd say that I can manage at least half, if not more, of the patients that have seizure disorder."" Many of the others are able to get by with just a one-time visit to a neurologist, said King, whose practice is 50 miles from the nearest neurologist, and 100 miles from the nearest neurologist who accepts Medicaid, the government program for the poor. ""There's only a handful of patients that are managed in my area by the neurologist."" He said financial barriers -- from insurance to the cost of anti-seizure medication -- are a bigger problem. ""If you can't afford to buy it -- which is what I run into with a lot of the seizure medicine -- it doesn't really matter"" if patients see a neurologist or a family physician, he said. Many patients, forced to choose between paying their light bill or taking their anti-seizure medication, choose the former, King said. Epilepsy is a condition in which the normal activity of the brain malfunctions, causing recurrent seizures -- electrical storms in the brain -- that can be characterized by a range of symptoms, including sudden change in awareness, movement or sensation. Each year, about 200,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease, as was Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts after he suffered a seizure last year at his Maine vacation home. ""Many people with epilepsy do lead normal, productive lives despite the hardship of having this disorder,"" Kobau said. The study, conducted by the federal government and published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, estimates that 2.7 million people in the United States have epilepsy, and that it costs some $15.5 billion in medical care and lost or reduced earnings or productivity each year. Hargis said the incidence of the disorder is expected to climb among veterans returning from Iraq or Afghanistan, where head injuries are common. ""When you have a head injury, it's common for epilepsy to develop after a gestational period -- it could be a couple of months or it could be years,"" he said. And the aging population is also expected to boost the incidence of epilepsy. Conditions of aging, such as stroke and Alzheimer's Disease, are also associated with a higher incidence of epilepsy. The study was based on data from more than 120,000 adults in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.","One in six adults with epilepsy who had recent seizures were not on medication .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of seven of eight snowmobilers missing after Sunday's avalanches in southeastern British Columbia have been found, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Monday. Authorities found seven bodies a day after avalanches in British Columbia, Canada. One man still was missing, but rescue personnel suspended their search near Fernie, British Columbia, at mid-afternoon Monday because of heavy snowfall and dense low clouds, the RCMP said. The search will resume Tuesday morning, authorities said. All eight men -- and three others who escaped -- faced two avalanches Sunday afternoon about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) east of Fernie, a town in the Canadian Rockies about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of Calgary, Alberta. The three survivors suffered minor injuries, and one of them was hospitalized overnight. The men had been in an area called Harvey Pass, which police called a popular backcountry snowmobile destination. Officials said an avalanche buried part of the group, and a second buried the rest as they tried to assist. ""Two of the buried riders managed to self-rescue within about 20 minutes. These two used their avalanche beacons to locate a third buried victim who they rescued after an additional 20 minutes of digging,"" police said. iReport.com: Wyoming avalanche training covers pulling people out of snow . A search command post was set up Sunday, but darkness and avalanche hazards prompted authorities to postpone the search until Monday. On Monday morning, before the bodies were found, authorities said searchers and police dogs were being dispatched to the rugged, snowy area, and crews would dig into any sites where searchers thought they might find any of the missing men. The snowmobilers resided in Sparwood, a small town just north of Fernie. Sparwood's mayor, David Wilks, said Monday morning that ""it certainly doesn't look good"" for the missing. ""Reality tells us if you're stuck in the snow for about 24 hours, bad things can happen,"" he said. The region has had previous coal mine disasters, ""but in recent memory, this is the largest single tragic event to hit this community,"" Wilks said. iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video . He said the snowmobilers are men in their mid- to late 20s and described them as upstanding citizens, most of them working in coal mines or as businessmen. ""All were well aware of the dangers involved in snowmobiling. All are very cautious with what was going on,"" Wilks said. The mayor said temperatures had been as low as minus-30 degrees Fahrenheit in recent weeks, but the air had warmed up in the last two or three days to 25 degrees Fahrenheit.

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN)  -- South Africans waited on election results Thursday in a ballot that the ruling African National Congress party appeared on course to win in a landslide. ANC leader Jacob Zuma is expected to be South Africa's next president. South African media reported Thursday that the ANC had won around 65 percent of the vote with one third of ballots counted. Reports suggested the opposition Democratic Alliance could be on course to claim control of Western Cape province -- but the ANC was ahead in the country's eight other provinces. ""This party is an elephant. You cannot actually topple an elephant,"" presidential candidate Jacob Zuma told thousands of supporters at ANC headquarters in central Johannesburg, according to Reuters.com. Zuma, who danced and sang his trademark ""Bring me my machine gun"" anti-apartheid anthem, stressed the ANC was ""not yet celebrating victory."" Final results are not expected until Saturday. All counting is done by hand in the country, which has 23 million registered voters. Members of parliament will elect the country's president next month. The Independent Electoral Commission said the number of people voting on Wednesday created long lines and a shortage of ballot boxes and papers in some districts and voting stations.  Watch as South Africa waits for a winner » . ""We thank voters for their enthusiasm and patience as they waited to exercise their democratic right to vote,"" commission Chairwoman Brigalia Bam said Wednesday. Although the ANC is widely expected to win, it remains to be seen how much ground the two main opposition parties -- the Democratic Alliance and the Congress of the People -- will gain, and whether the ANC will be able to hold onto its two-thirds parliamentary majority. The ANC has gained votes in every election since 1994, when the country held its first democratic election. But the Congress of the People -- a breakaway faction of the ANC -- threatens the ruling party's grip on power.  Voter shares feelings about ANC and new rival » . The ANC has been dogged by allegations of corruption and has been accused of failing to deliver services to the poor. And Zuma until recently faced fraud and corruption charges. The country's prosecuting authority dropped the charges two weeks before the elections, citing alleged political interference in the case.

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Bolivian President Evo Morales said Wednesday he does not regret expelling the U.S. ambassador last year, maintaining again that the envoy was plotting with opposition politicians. Bolivian President Evo Morales maintains the U.S. ambassador was plotting against Morales' government. Bolivia declared U.S. Ambassador Philip Goldberg persona non grata in September and ordered him to leave. Goldberg denied that he encouraged anti-government demonstrators to commit violent acts. ""I don't regret having expelled the ambassador, Mr. Goldberg,"" Morales said in an exclusive interview Wednesday with CNN en Español. ""And now, with the events we are seeing and we are finding, it is confirmed that he was conspiring against the government, conspiring against the national territory. He is an expert in dividing countries, with external groups and in Bolivia."" Morales also expelled a lower-level U.S. diplomat last month, accusing him of contacting opposition groups. Morales indicated Wednesday, however, that he is open to reviewing the issue since President Obama is in office. ""With the new times,"" he said, ""we expect to improve diplomatic relations. So we have to revise our politics. You can't conspire against us nor blackmail us. But if there's mutual respect, welcome."" Morales also said an assassination plot against him and other government officials that he alleged last week was real. Three gunmen were killed and two others were arrested Thursday after a 30-minute firefight in the city of Santa Cruz. At least two of the gunmen were foreigners, Bolivian authorities said. Morales said last week he had been aware of the assassination plot, which was verified after the arrest of the gunmen. Opposition politicians expressed doubt about the plot, saying Morales had made similar allegations in the past based on flimsy evidence. The gunmen, he said Wednesday, wanted ""to take power violently and also undemocratically. But also, if they could not take power, divide a region of the country. ... And for that, they had to take lives."" Morales did not mention who might want to divide the country, but five resource-rich eastern regions and the eastern province of Gran Chaco have been seeking greater autonomy. Earlier Wednesday, Morales addressed the United Nations in observance of Earth Day. He called for the nations of the world to accept a set of principles that would protect the planet's resources and ""right to life."" Morales, the first indigenous president in Bolivia's history, told the U.N. General Assembly that people cannot put their interests above those of the Earth. ""Not just human beings have rights, but the planet has rights,"" he said. ""What's happening with climate change is that the rights of Mother Earth are not being respected."" Telling the U.N. delegates that ""we have the challenge to agree on a universal declaration for the rights of Mother Earth,"" Morales outlined four principles that he asked them to consider: . Morales pointed out how indigenous people in Bolivia have rites and rituals to honor the Earth. ""We now must begin to realize that the Earth does not belong to us,"" he said. ""It's the other way around. We belong to the Earth."" Earth Day was started in 1970 in the United States as a way to bring awareness to the ecological problems plaguing the planet. It is celebrated in many parts of the world.","NEW: Bolivia's Evo Morales says ordering ambassador to leave was right move .

"(CNN)  -- President Obama said in an interview aired Sunday that the hardest decision he's made since taking office was to send more troops to Afghanistan. In a ""60 Minutes"" interview, President Obama said, ""I fundamentally disagree with Dick Cheney."" Also in the interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" Obama defended his decision to shut down the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,  and he countered criticism from former vice president Dick Cheney. ""I fundamentally disagree with Dick Cheney -- not surprisingly,"" Obama said. ""I think that Vice President Cheney has been at the head of a movement whose notion is somehow that we can't reconcile our core values, our Constitution, our belief that we don't torture, with our national security interests. I think he's drawing the wrong lesson from history."" Obama was responding to comments Cheney made to CNN's ""State of the Union"" on March 15, when he said the president is making the nation less safe by closing the Guantanamo prison and ending interrogation practices that Bush administration critics consider torture for terror suspects. Just a month into office, Obama ordered 17,000 troops to Afghanistan, the original front in the ""war on terrorism"" sparked by the September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington. ""I think it's the right thing to do. But it's a weighty decision because we actually had to make the decision prior to the completion of the strategic review that we were conducting,"" Obama said. Coming off a tumultuous week over the millions in bonuses paid out to employees of AIG, Obama said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's job is secure despite critics calling for his resignation. Obama joked that even if Geithner were to tender his resignation, the president would tell him, ""Sorry buddy, you've still got the job."" Geithner has come under fire over the $165 million in bonuses AIG paid its top executives after the insurance giant received more than $170 billion in federal bailout money. A loophole in the recently approved economic stimulus bill, included at the behest of the Treasury, allowed AIG to pay the bonuses. ""It's going to take a little bit more time than we would like to make sure that we get this plan just right,"" Obama said. The president also stressed that his administration won't endorse a House bill that would levy a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid out by companies that receive bailout money. ""As a general proposition, you don't want to be passing laws that are just targeting a handful of individuals,"" Obama said. ""You want to pass laws that have some broad applicability ... you certainly don't want to use the tax code to punish people.""","Dick Cheney has drawn 'the wrong lesson from history,' president said .

"(CNN)  -- Stop, speed racers, stop. Police say the cars were pulled over on a dangerous stretch of Highway 18 near Grand Ronde, Oregon. So said Oregon State Senior Trooper David Petersen after he was able to catch up with six exotic sports cars on a stretch of Highway 18 near Grand Ronde on Thursday, according to a news release. Perhaps a more amazing feat was that he stopped all the cars simultaneously. ""They just were all good little soldiers and pulled right over,"" Oregon State Police spokesman Lt. Gregg Hastings told CNN. One of the drivers was later cited again on a different highway. The drivers of the cars -- consisting of Ferraris, a Lamborghini and an Acura NSX -- told Petersen they were part of a group of 20 similar cars making an annual road trip, the news release said. They were all cordial and cooperative, and were cited with speed racing, a class A traffic violation that can command a fine of $627, Hastings said. After receiving reports Thursday morning that several sports cars were speeding and passing in no-pass zones west of Grand Ronde, Petersen set up east of the casino town, near McMinnville, and waited. Five of the cars soon blew past him, running about 100 mph in a 55-mph zone, Hastings said. As Petersen pulled onto Highway 18 in pursuit, a sixth car passed him. ""I guess when you're going too fast, you're in a rock and a hard place,"" Hastings said. Highway 18 runs from Dayton, Oregon, in the Willamette Valley to the Pacific coast. The stretch where the cars were cited is considered particularly dangerous and the Oregon Department of Transportation provides additional funding to enforce traffic laws there, Hastings said. About two hours after the incident, another trooper pulled over the Lamborghini from the group in Multnomah Falls, about 90 miles east. The driver of the car, which bore the the license plate ""BADBUL,"" was cited for driving 90 in a 65-mph zone, according to a news release.","Police: 6 exotic sport cars, mostly Ferraris, pulled over ""like good little soldiers""

"(CNN) -- Michigan authorities are investigating whether foul play led to the death of a 9-year-old quadriplegic girl whose body was found inside a public storage facility. Shylea Thomas, 9, of Flint, Michigan, was quadriplegic and used a feeding tube. ""This is a very sad and tragic case that hurts all of us involved in the ongoing investigation,"" Genesee County prosecutor David Leyton said at a news conference Wednesday. Shylea Myza Thomas of Flint, Michigan, hadn't been seen in six weeks, and relatives reported her missing Tuesday, Leyton's office said. Her adoptive mother, who is also her aunt, is in custody as a suspect, special assistant prosecuting attorney John Potbury told CNN. No charges have been filed pending the results of the autopsy, he said. Because of her physical disabilities, Shylea used a feeding tube. She suffered from quadriplegia because of a ""suffocation issue"" in her crib at 3 weeks of age, Leyton said. On Wednesday, Flint police found her body stuffed inside a garbage bag in a public storage facility in Vienna Township, near Flint, Leyton said. The bag was covered in mothballs ""in an apparent attempt to mask odors from the dead body,"" his office said in a news release. ""For her to have to live like that, and then to die and be stuffed into a bag and plastic bin in a storage facility, just breaks my heart,"" the prosecutor said. CNN affiliate WJRT reported that the suspect could face charges including murder, first-degree child abuse and welfare fraud. The station also reported that investigators are trying to determine why the girl's disappearance wasn't reported until six weeks after she went missing. Relatives told WJRT that they remember Shylea as a happy child, who loved music and whose smile was infectious.  Watch a family in shock » .

"(CNET) -- Compact-camera manufacturers have begun testing the waters with a wealth of high-end features as they search for new ways to gain revenue, market share, and recognition. A prototype of Olympus' Micro Four Thirds model, one of several small cameras with big features. In earlier digital photography days, a camera with an extra megapixel of resolution, face recognition, or image stabilization could stand apart from the herd. But now that herd has grown larger, most folks who'll buy a digital camera already have done so, the economy has put consumer spending on ice--and camera makers are making some bolder bets with high-end features. Among them: Nikon's built-in GPS support to record where a photo was taken, Casio's high-speed video, and the Micro Four Thirds camera system from Panasonic and Olympus. Premium features aren't an easy sell. They tend to appeal to market niches rather than the mainstream. Early implementations are often rough around the edges. And it's hard enough to convince people to buy a new camera, much less one with the higher price of premium features. But winning those customers can have a good payoff with better profit margins. And that's critical in this day and age. Market research firm IDC expects that after years of growth, the shipments of digital cameras will decline in 2009. ""It's crowded, and it's getting crowdeder,"" IDC analyst Ron Glaz said of the digital camera market. ""We're anticipating that with the slowdown in economy and disposable income, we'll start seeing consolidation of the vendors."" In other words, even though something in the neighborhood of 38 million digital cameras are sold annually, some companies will throw in the towel. Even as the compact-digital market saturated in recent years, digital SLRs showed strong market growth. Some high-end compact models are geared for those thinking of buying an SLR, but who want something less bulky and complicated. Another type: SLR owners who need something they can slip into a pocket or easily take on a trip. Dethroning Canon . The company to dethrone here is Canon, the leader of the compact camera market. Not only does it have seemingly innumerable cameras for every variation of consumer, but it also has long offered its G series for enthusiasts who are willing to pay a premium for high-end features. The current PowerShot G10 offers 14.7 megapixels of resolution, full manual controls, support for raw image format, a durable body, and a relatively fast lens. ""There have always been competitive products for the G-series. However, the range of competitors has expanded recently. Now, not only high-end point-and-shoot, but also low-end DSLR products are priced about the same as the G10,"" Canon said in a statement. The company has offered a new G-series model each year since 2006, and Canon believes the G10 to be the leading high-end compact camera in the United States. Canon shares dominance in the SLR market with Nikon, and in the compact market, Nikon's Coolpix P6000 is aimed straight at Canon's G10. The P6000's chief distinguishing feature is its built-in GPS receiver, which enables the camera to know where it is when a photo is taken. That location data is written into the image file through a process called geotagging that lets people sort their photos not just by when they were taken or by what folder on a computer they were stuffed into, but also by where they were taken. ""Having GPS in the camera makes all the sense in the world to me,"" Glaz said. ""People are now capturing thousands of pictures a year. There are only a few things they remember about them--I was in Paris, it was around the holidays."" So location data is important, especially as software arrives that can convert a photo's latitude-longitude information into a place name. That will let people search for photos by typing in text, not just by looking at image thumbnails on a map. The Micro Four Thirds contenders . The P6000 and G10 are self-contained, one-off cameras. If you don't like them, you can wait a couple years and buy the next model in the category. But Olympus and Panasonic are trying something much more ambitious in the market: the Micro Four Thirds standard. The two companies already sell SLRs that use the earlier Four Thirds standard, which governs the sensor size along with the interchangeable lenses mounting system and communication with the camera body. Micro Four Thirds is a smaller variation that employs the same size sensor but smaller lenses, and cameras forsake SLRs' space-consuming flip-up mirror. ""We're looking at (Micro Four Thirds) as the ability to offer a high-end interchangeable lens camera in an extremely small, compact body at an affordable price that would appeal to individuals coming up from the point-ad-shoot space, looking for a more sophisticated camera system they could grow with,"" said Sally Smith Clemens, product manager for Olympus Imaging America. It's for the person who demands high image quality but wants to be able to fit a camera and three lenses in a small fanny pack. Casio's EX-FH20 camera can shoot slow-motion video. This one slows down time by a factor of 14 but has a native resolution of only 224x168 pixels. At 1000 frames per second, it's a 224x56 strip. So far, Olympus has only shown a slim Micro Four Thirds concept model, and despite some speculation to the contrary, that's all it'll show at the Photo Marketing Show in March, Smith Clemens added. But Panasonic already has its first first Micro Four Thirds model for sale, the $670 Lumix DMC-G1. While Olympus' Micro Four Thirds effort is steered initially toward small models resembling the rangefinder cameras from the film era, Panasonic's G1 is relatively expensive and bulky, smaller than an SLR but not something that fits into a pocket easily. Some wags have called the G1 a ""Barbie SLR."" But it shows what can be done with Micro Four Thirds, leading Popular Photography magazine to name the G1 camera of the year. DxO Labs has found the G1's sensor quality to be superior to that of Canon's G10, boding well for Micro Four Thirds models. Sensor size has a lot to do with image quality--and price--and Micro Four Thirds sensors, at 17.3mm by 13mm are vastly larger that those used in compact cameras. That's important when shooting in dim conditions and when trying to get the best range of colors and tones. Panasonic's ambition . Panasonic, which hasn't had much success with its Four Thirds SLR line against giants Canon and Nikon, is eagerly pursuing the Micro Four Thirds direction. Along with the G1 and two lenses, a 14-45mm model and a 45-200mm model (the equivalent of 28-90mm and 90-400mm in 35mm camera terms), Panasonic plans to release three more lenses this year: a 7-14mm f4, a fast 20mm f1.7, and an image-stabilized 14-140mm f4-5.6. ""I do see this being a big part of our future,"" said David Briganti, Panasonic's national marketing manager for imaging. ""The only people having extreme success in the true digital SLR world are Canon and Nikon. Sony is a huge player in the digital compact camera space, but even Sony has struggled despite the huge efforts with their Alpha line. We'll still have Four Thirds models, and there will be potential for new models in the future, but we feel there's a huge opportunity that's been missed by camera manufacturers today,"" the step-up from ordinary compact cameras. Panasonic believes there are 23 million people in the market who are willing to buy digital SLRs, but only 7 million have done so, and Micro Four Thirds is aimed at the other 16 million. Micro Four Thirds, though, is a hybrid technology that remains unproven in the market, Glaz said. ""Nobody knows if people will buy them. The G1 is kind of in a no-man's land at this point,"" he said. Why not make things even easier by skipping the interchangeable lenses altogether and shipping an model with a big zoom range? In short, physics constraints preclude ultrazoom cameras with large image sensors, Briganti said. In general, the larger the sensor, the larger the lenses to support it must be. There is room for improvement, though. The G1 can't shoot video--despite not being encumbered by the mirror that makes video in SLRs so difficult. But Panasonic plans a new model this year that will support high-definition video, Briganti said. Casio's need for speed . Casio has long had a niche with its very slim compact cameras, but in 2008 it started offering a new selling point: super-high-speed video. Most digital cameras shoot video at 30 frames per second, but Casio's $1,000 EX-F1 can shoot much faster: 512x384-pixel resolution at 300 frames per second or 336x96 at 1,200 frames per second, for example. Later came the EX-FH20, which at $600 isn't as expensive, then at the Consumer Electronics Show, the still cheaper EX-FS10 and EX-FC100. These cameras also will take a high-speed burst of full-resolution still images, making it easier at least in theory to capture that exact moment when the your son's bat hits the baseball. ""The megapixel wars have peaked out,"" said Bill Heuer, head of Casio's digital camera division. ""We challenged R&D to come up with something to use technology to do things that haven't been done before...Our goal is to establish categories that are profitable to us and to the retailer."" With the camera industry now operating at the breakneck speed of computing technology, it's certain other camera makers will try to stake their claims with high-end options. Fujifilm's $400 F200EXR has a sensor designed to work better in low-light conditions. But it's not just a research and development challenge. The industry now has to convince budget-constrained consumers that the new high-end features aren't just gimmicks but are actually advances worth spending money on. © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc.

"(CNN) -- The fourteenth suspicious fire in a month's time hit a small community near Philadelphia before dawn Sunday. A huge fire spread through more than a dozen homes Sunday outside Philadelphia, authorities said. The seven-alarm fire in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, damaged more than a dozen homes and caused nearly $2 million in damage, according to city spokeswoman Kristin Geiger. No residents were injured, she said. It took 150 firefighters three hours to bring the blaze under control, and one firefighter broke his ankle, CNN affiliate WPVI reported.  Watch a town fearful of what's next » . Authorities in the city announced a state of emergency on Sunday. In a statement, Coatesville City Manager Harry Walker said the declaration would allow him to ""promulgate whatever special rules and regulations necessary to protect"" citizens. It would also let him request assistance from other municipalities and ""enter into contracts, employ temporary personnel, rent equipment, purchase supplies without regard to the normal procedures and formalities prescribed by law,"" Walker wrote. Authorities have been imploring residents to remove anything flammable from outside their homes -- including porch furniture and trash. Standing outside the latest blaze early Sunday, resident Janet Jackson said it had broken out just behind her house. ""I woke up and everything was in flames,"" she said, adding, ""It's really scary. ... I mean we're all afraid to even be in our houses right now."" Francis Dorsheimer said he had just arrived home when his family told him they needed to leave right away because a neighbor's house was on fire. He ran outside and saw flames ""shooting off the roof."" ""Must have been like 15-foot flames or higher,"" he said. ""It was just unbelievable. All the smoke in the air -- you could hardly breathe.""  Watch the flames eat away at homes » . Beverly Rivera watched firefighters put out the blaze at the home that she had recently moved out of. She still had possessions inside. ""Whoever's doing this, this is just absolutely ludicrous,"" she said. Referring to suggestions that the fires may be the result of gang activity, Rivera said, ""If it's a gang, please stop, and find something else to do. Because this is, this is terrible. This is absolutely unreal."" ""I never thought Coatesville would be on the map for something like this,"" she added. ""It's just awful. Just awful."" Thirteen previous suspected arsons have occurred since the start of the year in Coatesville. Fifteen suspected arsons happened in 2008 -- including one that killed an 83-year-old woman, Geiger said. The fires do not appear to follow a clear pattern, she said. Three suspects were arrested in December, and confessed to some of the fires, said Geiger. The suspects -- two adults and one juvenile -- are still in custody, she said. A $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to whomever has been setting the latest fires. Federal officials have joined the investigation, WPVI reported. Two homes were first spotted in flames at 11:30 p.m. The blazes spread and burned 15 homes, causing damage estimated at about $120,000 per home or a total of $1.8 million. City officials expect a huge turnout at a city council meeting Monday when the fires will be discussed. Coatesville, about 45 miles west of Philadelphia, has about 11,000 residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.","NEW: Authorities in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, declare state of emergency .

Wu -- who has been in the business for three years, according to InStyle.com fashion director Joe Berean -- said he intended the gown to stand for everything that she and President Obama are about.  Listen to Berean critique Michelle Obama's inauguration outfits » . ""It's about hope. It's about newness,"" he said. ""It's all a little dreamlike, and we're making history, and I wanted to really reflect that."" The Neighborhood Ball, a first of its kind and one of the balls open to the public, was the first of 10 official balls that the Obamas were scheduled to attend. For the new president, the first was particularly important. ""I cut my teeth doing neighborhood work and this campaign was organized neighborhood by neighborhood,"" he said. For that reason ""this ball is the one that captures best the spirit of this campaign,"" Obama said. The Obamas then moved to their second ball -- the Home State Ball, for Illinois and Hawaii --  at the Convention Center. After greeting the crowd by saying ""Aloha,"" the president thanked many in the crowd who he said were old friends who had been part of the couple's lives for awhile. ""This is a special ball because it represents our roots,"" he said. The couple laughed and embraced as they danced. President Obama even let loose after his long day, twirling his wife around in a circle -- a move the crowd cheered.  Time: See the glamour of past balls . Next, the Obamas made their way to the Commander-in-Chief Ball, attended by many members of the military, including wounded veterans. ""It is wonderful to be surrounded by some of the very best and bravest Americans,"" Obama said. ""Your courage, your grace and your patriotism inspire us all."" Obama told the crowd that there is ""no greater honor or responsibility than serving as your commander in chief.""  Watch the Obamas as the Commander-in-Chief Ball » . Obama then introduced members of the military from Illinois stationed in Kabul, Afghanistan. After thanking them, Obama took time for lighter banter, polling the members of the military about whether they were Chicago Cubs or Chicago White Sox baseball fans. ""Terrible!"" quipped Obama, known to be a huge White Sox fan, as most said they were Cubs fans. Then Obama introduced his wife, who took a moment to emerge from backstage. ""I may have been stood up,"" he joked, before she came out for their next dance. Next, the Obamas turned their attention to the Youth Inaugural Ball, where people between the ages of 18 and 35 gathered. ""When you look at the history of this campaign, what started out as an improbable journey -- when nobody gave us a chance -- was carried forward, was inspired by, was driven by, was energized by, young people all across America,"" Obama said. The president thanked the young people who came out to vote in dramatically high numbers, especially compared to past elections. He said a new generation inspired an older generation, and ""that's how change happens in America."" Afterward, the Obamas moved to the Home State Ball for Delaware and Pennsylvania, honoring Vice President Joe Biden. ""We are grateful to you, not only for the trust you bestowed, but also for a guy named Joe Biden,"" Obama said. Biden was born in Pennsylvania and later moved to Delaware, which he represented in the U.S. Senate. The Obamas then visited the rest of the parties earlier than scheduled and in quick succession, spending about five minutes each at the Mid-Atlantic, Western, Midwest, Southern and Eastern regional balls. At the Western Ball, singer Marc Anthony helped entertain about 11,500 guests, including film director Ron Howard and ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" actress Cheryl Hines. When the Obamas arrived, someone shouted ""I love you"" to the president. ""I love you back,"" Obama responded. ""Michelle loves you, too."" Before the couple's dance at the Midwest Ball, the president introduced the first lady by saying he'd ""like to dance with the one who brung me, and who does everything I do except ... in high heels."" The first couple's last dance of the night -- at the Eastern Ball -- happened shortly after 12:35 a.m. Wednesday. Melanie Roussell, a spokeswoman for the committee, said that in keeping with tradition, the Obamas and Biden and his wife, Jill,  would make appearances at each of the official balls. Quiz: First ladies gowns . There was more than chips and dip for the new president and his fellow partygoers. ""We will have a little more than light fare,"" said Roussell, who listed such menu items as penne Italiano and chilled chicken roulades with tomatoes, artichokes and pine nuts. The balls also featured plenty of music to suit just about everyone's taste. In addition to Beyoncé, the Neighborhood Inaugural Ball at the Walter E.

"(CNN) -- A woman in rural Papua New Guinea was bound and gagged, tied to a log and set ablaze on a pile of tires this week, possibly because villagers suspected her of being a witch, police said Thursday. Her death adds to a growing list of men and women who have been accused of sorcery and then tortured or killed in the South Pacific island nation, where traditional beliefs hold sway in many regions. The victims are often scapegoats for someone else's unexplained death, and bands of tribesmen collude to mete out justice to them for their supposed magical powers, police said. ""We have had difficulties in a number of previous incidents convincing people to come forward with information,"" said Simon Kauba, assistant commissioner of police and commander of the Highlands region, where the killing occurred. ""We are trying to persuade them to help. Somebody lost their mother or daughter or sister Tuesday morning."" Early Tuesday, a group of people dragged the woman, believed to be in her late teens to early 20s, to a dumping ground outside the city of Mount Hagen. They stripped her naked, bound her hands and legs, stuffed a cloth in her mouth, tied her to a log and set her on fire, Kauba said. ""When the people living nearby went to the dump site to investigate what caused the fire, they found a human being burning in the flames,"" he said. ""It was ugly."" The country's Post-Courier newspaper reported Thursday that more than 50 people were killed in two Highlands provinces last year for allegedly practicing sorcery. In a well-publicized case last year, a pregnant woman gave birth to a baby girl while struggling to free herself from a tree. Villagers had dragged the woman from her house and hung her from the tree, accusing her of sorcery after her neighbor suddenly died. She and the baby survived, according to media reports. The killing of witches, or sangumas, is not a new phenomenon in rural areas of the country. Emory University anthropology professor Bruce Knauft, who lived in a village in the western province of Papua New Guinea in the early 1980s, traced family histories for 42 years and found that one in three adult deaths were homicides -- ""the bulk of these being collective killings of suspected sorcerers,"" he wrote in his book, ""From Primitive to Postcolonial in Melanesia and Anthropology."" In recent years, as AIDS has taken a toll in the nation of 6.7 million people, villagers have blamed suspected witches -- and not the virus -- for the deaths. According to the United Nations, Papua New Guinea accounts for 90 percent of the Pacific region's HIV cases and is one of four Asia-Pacific countries with an epidemic. ""We've had a number of cases where people were killed because they were accused of spreading HIV or AIDS,"" Kauba said. While there is plenty of speculation why Tuesday's victim was killed, police said they are focused more on who committed the crime. ""If it is phobias about alleged HIV/AIDS or claims of a sexual affair, we must urge the police and judiciary to throw the book at the offenders,"" the Post-Courier wrote in an editorial. ""There are remedies far, far better than to torture and immolate a young woman before she can be judged by a lawful system.""","Woman suspected to be witch in Papua New Guinea burned alive .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy has captured seven suspected pirates in the Gulf of Aden, the first arrests by a U.S.-led task force set up to curb rampant piracy off the Horn of Africa, a Navy spokesman said Wednesday. Seven men suspected of trying to pirate a tanker raise their hands before their arrest in the Gulf of Aden. Sailors from the cruiser USS Vella Gulf arrested the men Wednesday in the western Gulf of Aden -- a waterway between Africa and the Middle East -- after a distress call from the 420-foot (128-meter) tanker Polaris. The tanker reported that men aboard a small skiff were attempting to board the ship using ladders, but its crew removed them before the would-be hijackers could get aboard, the Navy said. The Vella Gulf found and boarded the skiff, and the tanker's crew identified the men aboard the skiff as their would-be hijackers. The skiff's men were taken aboard the Vella Gulf, the flagship of the task force now patrolling the western Gulf of Aden, and eventually will be transferred to Kenya for trial, said Lt. Nate Christensen, a spokesman for the U.S. 5th Fleet. Piracy has become a chronic problem off the Horn of Africa in recent years, with some pirates operating from largely lawless Somalia. Pirates attacked nearly 100 vessels and hijacked as many as 40 in the waters off the coast of Somalia in 2008, according to the International Maritime Bureau. The task force led by the Vella Gulf was set up in January in an effort to clamp down on the attacks in the region, the southern approach to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal.","Seven men captured after failed attack on ship, U.S. Navy says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- After a lifetime of playing characters past-their-prime, Clint Eastwood appears to still be enjoying his own. Clint Eastwood stars as inspector Harry Callahan in ""Dirty Harry"" (1971). Just last week the 78-year-old actor, best-known for his portrayal of ""tough guys"" like ""Dirty Harry,"" was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the organizers of the Cannes Film Festival. The American film-maker accepted the Palme d'Or (only the second they've ever given for lifetime achievement), while he was in town promoting his new film ""Gran Torino."" What is your favorite Clint Eastwood movie? Tell us below in the SoundOff box. Eastwood both directs and co-stars in ""Gran Torino,"" as a prejudiced Korean war veteran who comes to the rescue of troubled Asian teens who live next door. For Eastwood the honor caps a 40 year career acting, directing, producing and composing. During this time, he has won five Academy Awards, five Golden Globes and received many more nominations. The Hollywood veteran earned perhaps most acclaim for two films: ""Unforgiven"" (1992) and ""Million Dollar Baby"" (2004). For each of these films he was awarded both Best Director and Best Picture Oscars, as well as being nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Eastwood got his break in 1959, landing the role of Rowdy Yates in the television series ""Rawhide."" A successful seven-year run helped turn Eastwood into a household name and landed him several other roles in so-called Spaghetti Western films, including the hit ""A Fist Full of Dollars"" (1964), directed by Sergio Leone. Leone then re-hired Eastwood for two more successful films: ""For a Few More Dollars"" (1965) and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1966). The trilogy earned Eastwood greater fame and a reputation for playing tough-guy, gun-slinging cowboys. Eastwood found another friend in director Don Siegel who gave him perhaps his most iconic role, starring in ""Dirty Harry"" (1971) as no-nonsense, ""loose-cannon"" cop Harry Callahan. The film was such a hit that it four spin off sequels were made: ""Magnum Force"" (1973), ""The Enforcer"" (1976), ""Sudden Impact"" (1983) (the highest grossing film of the series), and ""The Dead Pool"" (1988). In the 1990s Eastwood returned to westerns -- this time as director as well as star -- earning critical acclaim and a monumental nine Oscar nominations for ""Unforgiven"" (1992). Throughout the decade he also had considerable success helming blockbuster projects, like ""In the Line of Fire"" (1993), ""Bridges of Madison County"" (1995) and ""True Crime"" (1999). In 2000 Eastwood co-starred in the box-office hit ""Space Cowboys."" In 2004, he put employed his entire array of movie skills directing, producing, scoring and co-starring alongside Hillary Swank in boxing drama ""Million Dollar Baby."" Until his most recent return to the screen in ""Gran Torino,"" Eastwood had been concentrating on directing, releasing two films about World War II in 2006, ""Flags of our Fathers"" and ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and directing Angelina Jolie to BAFTA, Golden Globe and Oscar nominations this year in ""Changeling.""

"UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- Rapes targeting girls as young as seven are on the increase in Afghanistan where conditions for women are little better than under the Taliban, the U.N. and rights groups say. Conditions for women are little better than they were under the hardline Taliban regime, the U.N. says. In its annual report on human rights, the U.N. warned conditions were deteriorating in the war-ravaged country despite U.S.-led efforts after the 2001 removal from power of the hardline militia. ""Violence is tolerated or condoned within the family and community, within traditional and religious leadership circles, as well as the formal and informal justice system,"" said Navi Pillay, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights. The ""Afghan government has failed to adequately protect the rights of women despite constitutional guarantees."" With a resurgent Taliban targeting NATO forces, government security forces and civilians, violence has been on the increase in Afghanistan.. The number of civilian casualties in 2008 totaled 2,118 -- the highest number recorded since the ouster of the Taliban in 2001, the U.N. said, urging greater protecting for ordinary Afghans. Violence against women comes in the form of rape, ""honor killings,"" early and forced marriages, sexual abuse and slavery, the report says. ""The security is the big issue,"" said Suraya Pakzad, founder of the Voice of Women Organization, which promotes education and awareness of women's rights and protects women and girls at risk in Afghanistan. ""Because of security we, unfortunately, day by day, we have to pull out of areas where last year we operated, we have our operations. We were able to work with the women, but this year we cannot,"" she said. ""We have to leave the area because security is getting worse day by day."" ""Rapes in the country have been growing tremendously, particularly child rapes within the ages of 9, 8, 7, even lesser than that,"" said Wazhma Frogh, director of Global Rights Afghanistan. ""So these are the issues that are all born by this lack of security where women have no place in ... security decisions."" Domestic violence against child brides is widespread, said Suraya Pakzad, the founder of the Voice of Women organization, who was married at age 14 and has six children. She said girls as young as 10 face ""violation"" by husbands 40 years their senior. ""By the end ... women, or girls, run away."" But women without husbands, especially widows, may have it even worse in Afghanistan, the report says. Without a spouse, the women are reduced to begging to feed their children. Options outside the home are limited where the Taliban holds sway in Afghanistan. The Taliban's interpretation of strict Islamic law, or sharia, has included banning girls from school and the workplace. Even in areas not overrun by the Taliban, women face risks outside the home. ""The assassination of the most prominent national female senior police officer, in Kandahar in September 2008, underscores the tremendous risks faced by women in public life,"" the report says.","Afghan women's rights are little better than under Taliban, report says .

"Editor's note: Jeffrey D. Sachs is director of the Earth Institute and a professor at Columbia University. He also serves as special advisor to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on the U.N. Millennium Development Goals. From 2002 to 2006, he was director of the U.N. Millennium Project. He is president and co-founder of Millennium Promise, a nonprofit organization aimed at ending extreme global poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals. He has twice been named among the 100 most influential leaders in the world by Time magazine and is the author of the bestsellers ""Common Wealth"" and ""The End of Poverty."" Jeff Sachs says the G-20 countries must take steps to cushion the poor from the financial crisis. (CNN) -- The G-20 meeting in London, England, on April 2 will be watched by the entire world with urgency and with a yearning for hope, vision and programmatic clarity. The preparatory work is not adequate. The G-20 discussions do not move sufficiently beyond financial regulation. I would like to suggest the following main points for G-20 leadership in the global recovery. The G-20 needs to combine stimulus, economic development and sustainability: stimulus to get the world recession reversed, development to ensure that all of the world (not merely the rich countries or the G-20) shares in the benefits, and sustainability to address the world's grave risks of climate change, water stress and loss of biodiversity. The world's 3 billion poor, especially the 1 billion poorest of the poor, are suffering powerful and destabilizing blows from the crisis, and these will get worse and threaten global security unless there is specific attention and action. The G-20 cannot limit its focus to regulating the financial sector, reforming the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, avoiding protectionism and reciting the measures that individual countries are taking. This would leave the world gasping for direction and hope. The G-20 must offer a vision that is big enough to quell global fears and action bold enough to protect the desperately poor while guiding the cooperative decision-making of the world's economic authorities. The G-20 must push forward based on real policy coordination. The world does not have a system of effective cooperation. The United States, for example, does not engage in comprehensive and deep coordination with other countries. The poor countries, with half the world's population, and the poorest countries, with roughly one-fifth of the world's population, have not been brought into the equation. The G-20 package for stimulus should include: . First, fulfillment by all countries of stimulus measures already announced and a commitment to undertake new joint stimulus measures, especially priority public outlays on infrastructure, the social safety net and sustainable energy, as may be needed during the coming years. Second, establishment of a high-level G-20 coordination group, backed especially by China, the European Union, Japan and the United States, to work full-time on coordinating monetary, fiscal and financial policies for stimulus and long-term recovery. Such cooperative macroeconomic programming does not now exist. Third, increased currency support extended from the world's five major central banks (the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan and the People's Bank of China) for emerging market economies facing the loss of loans from international banks (e.g. Eastern Europe). The Fed's currency swap lines to Brazil, Mexico, Korea and Singapore last fall played an important stabilizing role. The other central banks can and should do more, as can the Fed vis-à-vis other countries. Fourth, a G-20 commitment to gradual and orderly currency readjustments to help rebalance the world's financial and trade flows. The Asian currencies should gradually appreciate against the euro, which in turn should appreciate gradually against the dollar. Squabbling about bilateral rates between the dollar and Chinese renmenbi should be put to rest. G-20 actions for the poor should include: . First, establishment of an urgent special food security program, which would make grants to low-income, food-deficit countries (including Africa, Haiti, Afghanistan and elsewhere) to ensure that impoverished farmers can get the basic input they need (such as fertilizer and high-yield seeds) to grow more food. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and Spain's Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero have joined to propose this new program and have mobilized backing from about a dozen countries. The United States' contribution should be at least $200 million per year over five years ($1 billion total), matching Spain, the largest donor country, and sending a powerful message of solidarity from the United States to the world. The hunger crisis is now afflicting 1 billion people and contributing to the deaths of millions of children each year. Second, full funding of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which is facing a critical and potentially devastating cash shortfall during 2009-11. An incremental U.S. contribution of $350 million in 2009 would close the most urgent cash-flow gap and put the United States in the clear lead of protecting the Global Fund and championing the fight against the three pandemic diseases. Third, special urgent long-term financing of clean energy investments in the poor countries, especially solar, geothermal, wind and hydro, as a direct stimulus to the supplier countries (including the United States), a development boost for the recipient countries (notably in Africa and Central Asia) and a major spur to climate control and success in negotiations this year. Fourth, accelerated distribution by the World Bank and the regional development banks of their unused financing capacities, directed at infrastructure and the Millennium Development Goals. The G-20 would commit to accelerate the replenishment of those funds on an expedited and as-needed basis. Fifth, urgently completing the pending injection of capital for regional development banks to bolster their lending and grants. (The Asian Development Bank, for example, is in the process of a recapitalization, which should be strongly supported by the United States and the rest of the G-20.) Sixth, an urgent easing of the conditions the IMF sets on its grants and loans to poor countries. This will ensure that those countries can receive and utilize greatly increased IMF financial backing to preserve trade finance and to have the room to undertake needed stimulus measures. Seventh, an explicit commitment by all parties to take the steps needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, the world's internationally agreed goals to fight extreme poverty, hunger and disease. (See http://www.milleniumpromise.org for details and ways to achieve them.) All parties should underscore their commitments to the goals, and the United States should emphasize its resolve to increase aid markedly by 2015. G-20 actions for sustainability should include: . First, a determination to ""green"" the stimulus in each country and to expand the development financing for sustainable infrastructure in the developing world, including solar power and efficient water use in sub-Saharan Africa. Second, a commitment to reach a climate agreement in Copenhagen, Denmark, which will steer large-scale investments in sustainable energy, next-generation automobiles, green buildings and so forth as a key plank of global recovery. Follow-up . I recommend that the United States offer to host the next G-20 meeting in September in advance of the U.N. General Assembly. China would be a logical host for the fourth G-20 meeting during early 2010. To enhance global coverage and legitimacy, the G-20 should be enlarged to be the G-22, to include representation of East and West Africa. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Sachs.","Jeffrey Sachs: When G-20 meets, it must do more than just financial regulation .

"(CNN) -- The risk of being jolted by 1,500 volts of electricity hasn't scared them off. Neither have fears of falling off the speeding electric trains. Thousands of passengers ride on overloaded trains in Jakarta every day. So Indonesian railway officials on Monday will unleash a new weapon on commuters who squat on top of railway cars: spray them with colored dye, a local newspaper reported. The state transit agency told the English-language newspaper Jakarta Post that it hopes the ""unique approach"" will deter passengers riding illegally on rooftops. Trains are the cheapest and fastest form of transportation for office workers commuting between the capital city Jakarta and neighboring towns. Throngs of thousands cram the trains during the morning and evening rush hours, making it impossible for everyone to snag space inside packed cars. Under the new plan, security officials at each station will ""mark"" roof riders with dye as trains depart. When the passengers disembark at their destination, officials can then easily identify them. ""We will confiscate their IDs and give them a ticket,"" Akhmand Sujadi, regional spokesman for the transit agency Kerata Api, told the newspaper. ""We will send a copy of the ticket to their family, their local neighborhood unit head, their employer, or, if they're students, their headmasters."" The offenders can reclaim their ID cards once they write a letter ""regarding their behavior, to be signed by the person who received their ticket."" More than 320,000 passengers rode trains to and from work every day last year, the newspaper reported. The crush of passengers meant revenues of 248 billion Rupiahs ($26.8 million) for the system. But many commuters prefer to ride on top of passenger cars -- either due to a lack of space inside or because they can't afford the ticket, which start at 1,000 Rupiahs ($0.11) At least 53 rooftop riders died in the last two years, the newspaper reported.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Barack Obama is planning to issue three executive orders Thursday, including one demanding the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay be closed within a year, according to a senior administration official and a congressional aide. A guard keeps watch from a tower at the military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A second executive order will formally ban torture by requiring the Army field manual be used as the guide for terror interrogations, essentially ending the Bush administration's CIA program of enhanced interrogation methods. A third executive order, according to the officials, will order a systematic review of detention policies and procedures and a review of all individual cases. The officials said new White House Counsel Greg Craig was briefing congressional Republicans Wednesday afternoon about the three executive orders. ""We've always said the process would include consultation,"" the senior administration official said of the closed-door meeting informing Republicans of the moves. The detention facility at Guantanamo Bay became a lightning rod for critics who charged that the Bush administration had used torture on terror detainees. President George W. Bush and other senior officials repeatedly denied that the U.S. government had used torture to extract intelligence from terror suspects. Obama's move will set off a fierce legal struggle over where the prison's detainees will go next.  Watch experts debate the Gitmo dilemma » . ""The key question is where do you put these terrorists,"" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement issued Wednesday. ""Do you bring them inside our borders? Do you release them back into the battlefield?"" The meeting with Craig did not address how the administration plans to handle Guantanamo detainees, said Rep. Bill Young of Florida, the top Republican on the Defense Appropriations Committee. The executive orders ""will leave some wiggle room for the administration,"" he said. Young said he has ""quite a bit of anxiety"" about transferring detainees to United States facilities. ""Number one, they're dangerous,"" he said. ""Secondly, once they become present in the United States, what is their legal status? What is their constitutional status? I worry about that, because I don't want them to have the same constitutional rights that you and I have. They're our enemy.""  Watch what may happen to Gitmo's inmates » . He said he asked Craig what the government plans to do with two recently built facilities at Guantanamo, which he said cost $500 million. He said Craig had no answer, but pledged to discuss the issue further. Young said he suggested reopening Alcatraz, the closed federal prison on an island outside San Francisco, California -- in Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's district. ""Put them in Alcatraz, where supposedly they can't escape from,"" Young said, but added the suggestion ""didn't go over well."" The revelation coincided with a judge's decision on Wednesday to halt the September 11 terrorism cases at the behest of President Obama. On Tuesday, he directed Defense Secretary Robert Gates to ask prosecutors to seek stays for 120 days so terrorism cases at the facility can be reviewed, according to a military official close to the proceedings. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Laurie Ure contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama to issue 3 orders Thursday that break from Bush administration .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN)  -- Suspected Maoist rebels in eastern India who held up a train carrying 300 passengers Wednesday ended their siege after a four-hour standoff, officials said. An election official in Maharashtra Wednesday. Maoist rebels seized the train as India continued to vote. No one was hurt, said A.K. Chandra of India's east-central railway. The suspected rebels seized the train, apparently to protest that some former comrades are taking part in general elections that are under way in the country. The Maoists didn't want the former rebels ""to join the mainstream and, therefore, stopped this train,"" said Sarvendu Tathagat, deputy commission of the Latehar district in the state of Jharkhand. Jharkhand is a mineral-rich state where rebels -- known as the Naxalites -- claim to be fighting for the rights of the poor and the dispossessed who have not benefited from the state's resources. About 300 men, apparently unarmed, boarded the train, disabling its braking system as it passed through a dense forest. The hijackers released the train after ""persuasion"" by area villagers and railway officials, Chandra said. ""They wanted your (media) presence,"" he said of the hijackers' possible motive. Jharkhand has seen stepped-up deadly attacks by rebels while the country is in the midst of month-long general elections. The second round of the elections begin Thursday. On April 16, when the voting began, suspected rebels triggered an explosion that forced a bus carrying border security troops to stop in the same Latehar district. When the troops stepped out, the attackers killed at least six in a three-hour gun battle. And in neighboring Bihar state, suspected Maoists, who had called for a general strike, set eight trucks on fire, shot dead a driver, and blew up a government office on Wednesday, police said. The Maoist insurgency has claimed more than 6,000 lives since the late 1960s. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has called the rebels India's biggest security threat. The elections, covering more than 3 million square kilometers of the planet, will run until next month in several stages of scattered polling. Then, elections officials will count the vote electronically in a single day -- on May 16, three days after the last round of polling. It is an exercise that India undertakes every five years for its 1 billion-plus population. This year, the country is voting in 543 boroughs of the Lok Sabha, or the lower house of the Indian parliament. In the elections this year, 714 million registered voters are eligible to cast ballots. The number is up 43 million from the last vote.","300 suspected Maoist rebels stop train as it passed through a forest in Jharkhand .

What the two organizations learned was both old and new: bankers giving themselves large salaries and generous bonuses, at the same time they are lending millions of dollars on what, according to one lawsuit, were essentially parcels of bare dirt with little potential of big income. Silver State Bank had been in business in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson for 10 years when Little, the bank's founder and CEO left. The bank had grown impressively under his guidance, but Little said his managers wanted more and he was forced out. ""They wanted bigger salaries, bigger lifestyle, fancier offices. Whatever. However you want to view that,"" Little told CNN. One of those managers was new bank president Corey Johnson, who declined to answer any questions. Three other managers declined comment to CNN, as well. Silver State and others loaned money on the promise of Las Vegas' commercial real estate boom with the belief that undeveloped land would be turned into shopping centers, hotels and offices. Records show that land and houses were being ""flipped"" or resold over and over at huge profits. Bill Martin, a Las Vegas banker who once worked as a regulator for the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington, said what was happening to Silver State was clear. ""They were over-advancing on construction, you know, more liberal advances on construction,"" Martin said. ""It all worked last year [and] the year before and the year before. So they just kept doing it."" Banking regulators issued repeated so-called ""mild"" warnings to banks concerned they were amassing large amounts of commercial development loans and lowering lending standards. But Martin says those warnings -- delivered by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation personnel often on a quarterly or semi-annual basis in their field visits to Silver State -- were ignored. One Silver State loan that turned out to be especially poor was to a Las Vegas developer who had been a longtime customer of the bank. According to bank records, a developer named Thomas Jurbala, received almost $100 million from Silver State during a 10-year period. In 2008, Jurbala came calling again and the bank approved a $24 million loan for a piece of ground in North Las Vegas far from the Last Vegas strip, supposedly valued at $48 million. It was a so-called ""interest reserve loan"" in which the bank not only loaned the principle amount but the interest, as well. Then, according to bank records, it booked the interest as revenue. Regulators say those sorts of deals are not uncommon in construction loans. But this particular piece of land was undeveloped with only a permit to build a casino there one day. It is near the Las Vegas Speedway and in court papers the developer said he hoped a casino could be built. However, the entire project was scrapped before a spade was ever turned, and the land sits empty surrounded by a fence. The project was scrapped because Silver State went under. Doug French, the man who made that loan, reluctantly agreed to sit down with CNN for a taped interview. He is now vice president at a Libertarian think tank in Auburn, Alabama. French told CNN that at ""the time"" he believed the land was ""very valuable."" But when it all went up in smoke, he says, ""It's very humbling, believe me."" French says mistakes at Silver State Bank were ""preventable,"" but according to a lawsuit filed by the developer, the loans were part of a series of loans, each one preceding the other -- to different corporations. At the time French left Silver State Bank, the bank told reporters he had resigned for ""personal reasons."" But French told CNN he was fired from Silver State. According to Securities and Exchange Commission documents, he sold $1.8 million in Silver State stock from November 2007 through February 2008. That was on top of his $650,000 in salary and bonuses, according to bank records. He left the bank in March 2008. In September 2008, when Silver State Bank collapsed, a group of elderly Las Vegas deaf residents was especially hurt. The local chapter of the Deaf Seniors Association put an estimated $400,000 into certificates of deposit sold by Silver State. That money was to be used to help fund the group's annual national convention in Las Vegas in 2009. The group lost half of its money. The FDIC said after it seized Silver State that it did not have enough capital to cover business activities. ""I just can't believe it happened,"" one woman told CNN through a sign language interpreter. ""We're just so frustrated."" The group is trying to raise funds in a more traditional manner by making quilts. They have a very long road ahead, its members say. Silver State Bank was the 25th bank to fail in the United States in 2008. As a result, the FDIC was left to cover more than a half-billion dollars in Silver State liabilities. Already this year, three U.S. banks have collapsed and experts predict many more will tumble as the economy continues to suffer.","Bank CEO says he was forced out for favoring slow growth, not being powerhouse .

"(CNN) -- The nation's new ""first dog"" has heightened interest in its breed -- Portuguese water dog -- but not necessarily a thorough understanding of the dogs' needs, a pair of owners and breeders told CNN. Bo the Portuguese water dog meets the camera. Bo was a gift to the Obama girls from Sen. Ted Kennedy. The dog, Bo, has triggered ""the most publicity the breed has ever had since its introduction into the U.S. in the late 1960s,"" the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America said in a news release. President Obama and his family welcomed Bo into the White House this week. Shortly afterward, the club's Web site was receiving a million hits an hour, said Susan Teasley, a club member. Jane Harding, a fellow member of the club, said she has ""received about a 10 percent increase in calls"" since Tuesday, and some of the other breeders she knows also have reported more calls. ""Thankfully, people want to know more about the breed,"" Teasley said. ""But water dogs are not for everybody, and it would be sad to see people getting the dog without doing the proper research."" Portuguese water dogs are ""active athletes,"" far from couch potatoes, she explained. In fact, they are more likely to rip a couch into pieces than lounge on it, Harding said, recalling a friend who had lost a sofa that way.  Watch more water dog fun » . Portuguese water dogs can be miserable and destructive when alone, Teasley said. And don't think you can close the door and keep them out. ""They want to be with you at all times -- even if it's in the bathroom or your bed,"" she said. Teasley and her husband breed Portuguese water dogs and often allow them to run free on the two and a half acres of land they own. They are ""not apartment dogs,"" she said. Harding agreed. ""They aren't for people who want a tie-out dog or an apartment dog. For people like that,"" she joked, ""we recommend a stuffed dog."" Portuguese water dogs love the outdoors, particularly if they have a garden to eat from, Teasley said as she wrestled to keep 7-month-old Misty Morning from eating the family's flowers. Harding said she believes the first family will be successful with their new dog because ""they have access to the best trainers, and they want to make this work."" For other Americans thinking about following suit, she cautioned, ""Buyers beware. Do your homework and first read the information on the breed."" Teasley wants people to understand the breed to help avoid what she called the ""Dalmatian syndrome."" After the movie ""101 Dalmatians"" came out in 1996, ""thousands of people rushed to get the dog, and thousands of dogs ended up in rescue kennels,"" Teasley said. What those who followed the Dalmatian trend may not have known is that Dalmatians shed profusely and they develop hearing problems, making it hard to train and call them, she said. Both Teasley and Harding advised owners to get a mentor, as they expect Sen. Ted Kennedy to be to the Obama family. Kennedy owns Portuguese water dogs himself and recommended the breed to the Obamas.  Watch Obamas introduce dog » . ""For the first six to seven months of the puppy's life, they need training,"" Harding said. She has diligently trained 8-year-old champion Bessie, who she said ""produces phenomenal litters ... and has multiple titles"" from the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America. Such organizations provide guidance to first-time dog owners. But it takes time to get a membership, Teasley said. Prospective members must apply for a one-year associate membership before they can receive a permanent one, she explained. That provides a cushion while they decide whether the dog is the right fit. ""It sounds like I'm trying to discourage people from getting (a Portuguese water dog),"" Teasley said, ""But I'm not. We just don't want dogs to come back because owners don't know what they are doing.""","Breeders fear too many people will try to get dog like the Obamas' Bo .

"(CNN) -- Rioting has flared near Belfast on Saturday after the arrests of three men in the killings of two soldiers in Northern Ireland last week, police said. Two people in masks prepare to throw petrol bombs Saturday in Lurgan, Northern Ireland. Petrol bombs have been hurled at police in Lurgan, a town in County Armagh, 20 miles west of Belfast, police in Northern Ireland said. There are gangs of youths on the streets, authorities said, but there have been no arrests or injuries. Police announced the arrests on Saturday and said the three men have been taken to the police service's Serious Crime Suite in County Antrim. One of them, a dissident republican named Colin Duffy, is from Lurgan. They are the first arrests in connection with the March 7 shootings, which were the first fatal attack on British troops in the province for more than 12 years. The two British soldiers were shot dead at a base in Massereene, in Antrim, as they were preparing to ship out for duty in Afghanistan. The soldiers, Cengiz ""Pat"" Azimkar, 21, and Mark Quinsey, 23, had already packed their bags and changed into desert uniforms, authorities said. Two masked gunmen with automatic rifles shot them as the soldiers picked up a pizza delivery at the barracks, authorities said. Two other soldiers and the two pizza delivery men were seriously wounded. The shooting has sparked fears of a return to the sectarian violence that Northern Ireland suffered until the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, a period known as The Troubles. A militant splinter group, the Real IRA, reportedly claimed it had carried out the attack on the soldiers. Two days after the soldiers were killed, a police officer was killed in a shooting southwest of Belfast. Constable Stephen Carroll was one of four officers who were responding to call in Craigavon when his vehicle came under fire and he was killed. Three people have been arrested in connection with the police officer's death. The Continuity IRA, a republican splinter group that does not accept the Good Friday Agreement, said it had killed Carroll, Britain's Press Association reported. Politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned the killings, with Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness calling the killers ""traitors to the island of Ireland."" Sinn Fein is a predominantly Catholic party that wants Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and become part of the Republic of Ireland. The party is widely thought to be linked to the Irish Republican Army. Danny Kennedy, deputy leader of the loyalist Ulster Unionist Party, which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, also condemned the attack as ""wicked and murderous.""","NEW: Petrol bombs hurled at police after arrests in connection with soldiers' killings .

"TAMPA, Florida (CNN) -- Don Stratton says he's just a good ol' boy. He's simple and plainspoken. But he has a painful past he can't leave behind. When he talks about it, the old emotions surface. Don Stratton says he and others were abused at the Florida School for Boys during the 1960s. Stratton attended a Florida reform school as a teenager in the early 1960s. Nearly half a century later, he's telling a chilling tale of alleged beatings, sexual abuse and violent death at the hands of reform school workers. He said he believes the bodies of slain boys are buried in unnamed graves on the grounds of the former reform school in Marianna, Florida. ""These men are animals and need to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,"" Stratton told CNN in an interview at his attorney's office in Tampa. Stratton wore a black cowboy hat with a Harley Davidson logo. Despite his tough exterior, he fought back tears as he recounted how he was physically and sexually assaulted. Stratton is among a group of men, now in their 60s, who are suing state agencies in Florida as well as two former reform school workers over alleged abuse they received as teenagers. The suit was filed this month. ""At 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, you'd hear a boy crying,"" Stratton told CNN. ""And then the door would open and you'd see these guys come in and come up to somebody they liked, and they'd just tell you, 'Come on with me, you're mine for tonight. You're my boy for tonight.' And they would take you and do what they wanted to do with you."" ""They would take a leather strap, six inches wide and three feet long,"" he added, swinging his arm in a downward motion. ""It's like a shotgun going off. And they beat you until you're bloody."" Stratton's attorneys said they've interviewed 80 former students who say they were abused. Stratton and the other alleged abuse victims who spoke with CNN all said the beatings took place in a small white cement building they called ""the white house."" Gov. Charlie Crist has ordered an investigation into the alleged abuse. He has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to uncover records, interview students and find former administrators. The agency also was asked to determine who, if anyone, is buried beneath the 31 rusting white crosses on the school grounds. ""Whatever is below those crosses is crying out -- and it's screaming for us to bring justice,"" Stratton said. The truth of what happened at the Florida School for Boys may ultimately be lost to time. But investigators said they're making progress. ""There are challenges due to the length of time that has passed,"" said Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokeswoman Heather Smith. ""We are confident that we can conduct a thorough and methodical investigation and establish, as much as we can, what happened here and what lies beneath in those grave sites."" Smith said it was much too early in the investigation to say whether there would be an exhumation. Investigators said that, so far, the search for records from 50 years ago has been productive. They also have met with many of the men who have come forward. When they meet with Stratton, they will hear his claim that he witnessed the violent death of one boy who exposed himself to reform school workers on a dare. The boy was taken to ""the white house."" Stratton said that later, while he was working in the kitchen, he saw a brown 1949 Ford pull up. ""They opened the back door and they carried him out and threw him in the back of the car,"" said Stratton, fighting tears. ""They took him out there and buried him in the woods,"" he said. ""I know they buried him somewhere, 'cause he never showed up again."" Investigators will also hear Stratton's claim that he and many of the other boys were sexually assaulted. His story is so graphic that it cannot be repeated. He tearfully apologized to CNN. ""I don't pull no punches, but it's hard doing this on camera. See what I'm saying? This is tough, fellas,"" he said. ""We're all men here, know what I mean? I'm not ashamed of it, but I was 13 years old and I had no choice ... and it haunts me today."" CNN has tried to find many of the men who are alleged to have committed the beatings and sexual assaults. Some have died. The lawsuit names former worker Troy Tidwell, a one-armed man who still lives near the reform school grounds in Marianna. It alleges he participated in physical assaults and failed to report the abuse. Tidwell refused to meet with CNN in December to respond to the allegations, but he recently told the Miami Herald that the boys were ""spanked"" but not injured. ''Kids that were chronic cases, getting in trouble all the time, running away and what have you, they used that as a last resort,'' Tidwell told the Herald. ""We would take them to a little building near the dining room and spank the boys there when we felt it was necessary."" Tidwell, in his 80s, has hired a law firm to represent him in the lawsuit. In court filings, his lawyers are trying to get the suit thrown out. His attorney did not return CNN's calls for comment. ""You've got to realize what these guys did,"" Stratton said. ""They mentally abused us, and they beat us. Is that something you should say: 'I'm sorry fellas. You're an old man now, live out the rest of your life in a rocking chair.' Well, no way.""","Lawsuit alleges abuse at Florida reform school during 1960s .

"(CNN) -- Earth Day may fall later this week, but as far as former NASA astronaut Edgar Mitchell and other UFO enthusiasts are concerned, the real story is happening elsewhere. Astronaut Edgar Mitchell, shown after his Apollo mission in 1971, claims there ""is no doubt we are being visited."" Mitchell, who was part of the 1971 Apollo 14 moon mission, asserted Monday that extraterrestrial life exists, and that the truth is being concealed by the U.S. and other governments. He delivered his remarks during an appearance at the National Press Club following the conclusion of the fifth annual X-Conference, a meeting of UFO activists and researchers studying the possibility of alien life forms. Mankind has long wondered if we're ""alone in the universe. [But] only in our period do we really have evidence. No, we're not alone,"" Mitchell said. ""Our destiny, in my opinion, and we might as well get started with it, is [to] become a part of the planetary community. ... We should be ready to reach out beyond our planet and beyond our solar system to find out what is really going on out there."" Mitchell grew up in Roswell, New Mexico, which some UFO believers maintain was the site of a UFO crash in 1947. He said residents of his hometown ""had been hushed and told not to talk about their experience by military authorities."" They had been warned of ""dire consequences"" if they did so. But, he claimed, they ""didn't want to go to the grave with their story. They wanted to tell somebody reliable. And being a local boy and having been to the moon, they considered me reliable enough to whisper in my ear their particular story."" Roughly 10 years ago, Mitchell claimed, he was finally given an appointment at Pentagon to discuss what he had been told. An unnamed admiral working for the Joint Chiefs of Staff promised to uncover the truth behind the Roswell story, Mitchell said. The stories of a UFO crash ""were confirmed,"" but the admiral was then denied access when he ""tried to get into the inner workings of that process."" The same admiral, Mitchell claimed, now denies the story. ""I urge those who are doubtful: Read the books, read the lore, start to understand what has really been going on. Because there really is no doubt we are being visited,"" he said. ""The universe that we live in is much more wondrous, exciting, complex and far-reaching than we were ever able to know up to this point in time."" A NASA spokesman denied any cover-up. ""NASA does not track UFOs. NASA is not involved in any sort of cover-up about alien life on this planet or anywhere else -- period,"" Michael Cabbage said Monday. Debates have continued about what happened at Roswell. The U.S. Air Force said in 1994 that wreckage recovered there in 1947 was most likely from a balloon-launched classified government project. Stephen Bassett, head of the Paradigm Research Group (PRG), which hosted the X-Conference, said that the truth about extraterrestrial life is being suppressed because it is politically explosive. ""There is a third rail [in American politics], and that is the UFO question. It is many magnitudes more radioactive than Social Security ever dreamed to be,"" Bassett said.","He says governments are concealing evidence that extraterrestrials exist .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il has been making the the rounds of major industrial facilities in the country's north, state-run media reported Thursday. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il meets people at a library in the country's north. It was the second time in as many days that state media reported Kim's activities. State media reported Wednesday that Kim had visited a steel company and expressed ""great satisfaction"" with workers' efforts. The steel factory tour generated no pictures, but his stops at a library and an electronics research facility in Jagang Province the day before did. Kim was shown bundled up in a parka with matching thick gloves. He was also wearing a fur hat and his signature dark sunglasses. The photos showed Kim engaged in conversation and active. South Korean media noted it was the first time since Kim reappeared in public October 4 -- after a hiatus of nearly 60 days -- that his activities have been reported two days in a row. Kim's disappearance during that period raised speculation about the North Korean leader's health. South Korean analysts said they believe the new reports are an attempt by the North Korean leadership to show Kim is healthy and in control. Last week, Francois-Xavier Roux, a French neurosurgeon at Saint-Anne Hospital in Paris, told a French newspaper that Kim had suffered a stroke, but is now better. The doctor said he last treated Kim in late October. The North has denied its leader was ever ill and state media has issued a series of reports portraying Kim as healthy and active.","North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il has appeared in public again .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A pedestrian was struck twice by vehicles in Queens and dragged for 17 miles by the second vehicle before police found him dead in Brooklyn, New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters Wednesday. Surveillance video shows a body in the middle of the street. The badly mangled body was discovered under a van after several passing motorists motioned the driver to pull over, Kelly said. Police had not identified the victim Wednesday evening, he said. The first driver called 911 to report he thought he had struck a pedestrian but did not see anyone. It turned out the second driver, in a van, had driven over the man, whose body became lodged under its chassis, according to police. Kelly said the van driver stopped at one point during the drive on New York City's highways and roads because he noticed the vehicle was not driving properly. But he failed to find anything unusual, Kelly said. Police are retracing the route the van drove in an attempt to find body parts, he said. No charges have been filed, Kelly told reporters Wednesday afternoon.","Pedestrian struck twice, dragged 17 miles by second vehicle, New York police say .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Thousands of visitors lined Constitution Avenue in Washington on Saturday morning for the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival Parade. The annual two-week National Cherry Blossom Festival runs through April 12. ""Jeopardy!"" host Alex Trebek served as the parade's grand marshal, waving to crowds from the back of a convertible. ""American Idol"" finalist Kimberly Locke, the cast of the musical ""Chicago"" and D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton were among the parade's stars. The cherry blossom trees were a gift of friendship to the U.S. government from Japan in 1912, according to the National Park Service. Their blooming has come to represent the definitive beginning of springtime in the nation's capital. The parade is part of the annual two-week National Cherry Blossom Festival, which is timed around the projected peak bloom period of the famous trees. This year, the trees reached their peak bloom this week, according to the park service. Many high school groups and marching bands also participated in the parade. Near the National Mall, large crowds mingled under the branches of the blossoming trees that line the Tidal Basin. On an unusually blustery day, the delicate pink and white blossoms blew from their branches like snowflakes. ""It's like being in a fairy tale,"" said Maria Podonyi, a visiting professor from Hungary. Podonyi brought her parents, who are visiting the United States from Hungary, to the festival.

"(CNN) -- An Iranian human-rights activist and Nobel laureate has joined the legal team of an Iranian-American journalist convicted of spying and jailed in Iran. Shirin Ebadi, a civil rights leader in Iran, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003. Shirin Ebadi, who won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2003, took up the case of Roxana Saberi at the request of Saberi's family, her father, Reza Saberi, told CNN Wednesday. Ebadi heads the Center for Defenders of Human Rights in Iran. Saberi, 31, was sentenced Saturday to eight years in prison after a one-day trial that was closed to the public.  President Obama, as well as other U.S. and international officials sharply denounced the decision. The Rev. Jesse Jackson has offered to travel to Iran to help seek Saberi's release. ""If our voices are heard in Iran today, I would be anxious to travel with a delegation to Iran, if we are permitted, and make an appeal for her freedom,"" said the longtime civil rights activist, according to his Rainbow PUSH Coalition. Jackson, 67, spoke Tuesday at a peace conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ""Whenever we've brought people out of captivity, whether in Syria, Cuba, Iraq or Yugoslavia, or Liberia, it's always opened a diplomatic door to reduce tensions,"" he said. Saberi's attorneys said they will appeal her conviction. Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Hashemi Shahroudi ordered the head of Tehran's Justice Department to make sure the appeals process is quick and fair. Jackson has offered in the past to help release American hostages, most recently in 2005. At that time, he said he was willing to use his role as a religious leader to help secure the release of Roy Hallums, who was kidnapped along with five others in Baghdad in November 2004. Hallums was freed in September 2005 when U.S.  troops raided the farmhouse where he being held outside Baghdad. In 1984, Jackson secured the release of a Navy pilot held in Syria. In 1991, he helped secure the release of 500 ""international guests"" held in Iraq. And in 1999, he persuaded Yugoslavia to release three U.S. soldiers held there during the Kosovo conflict. Obama has called for Saberi's release, saying he is ""gravely concerned with her safety and well-being.""  Watch how U.S.-Iranian relations are complicated » . ""We are working to make sure that she is properly treated, and to get more information about the disposition of her case,"" Obama said Sunday. ""She is an American citizen, and I have complete confidence that she was not engaging in any sort of espionage."" Iranian officials initially said Saberi was held for buying a bottle of wine. The Foreign Ministry later said she was detained for reporting without proper credentials. Saberi, who comes from North Dakota, has been living in Iran since 2003, said the Committee to Protect Journalists, a journalists' advocacy group. She has freelanced for National Public Radio and other news organizations, and was writing a book about Iranian culture. Iranian authorities revoked her press credentials in 2006, but Saberi continued to file short news items without permission, the journalists' group said. Saberi was detained in January, although no formal charges were disclosed. On April 9, word emerged that Saberi had been charged with espionage. ""Without press credentials and under the name of being a reporter, she was carrying out espionage activities,"" Hassan Haddad, a deputy public prosecutor, told the Iranian Students News Agency. Authorities also said Saberi had confessed. Her father said he thinks she was coerced into making damaging statements. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi offers to help in Iran .

"(OPRAH.COM) -- Here's a little fact of life that took me by surprise: Roughly 23 million women in this country are 40 to 49 years of age and about 6,000 of us turn 50 every single day. We are a thoroughly undefined constituency. Some of us are what the wonderful Wendy Wasserstein used to call ""bachelor girls,"" some of us are married, and a lot of us have had trial separations that seemed to go just fine...at least for the husband (with the struggling rock band), who went on to become the ex-husband (with the thriving law practice). Many of us have demanding kids or aging parents or a little of each. We juggle jobs, mortgages, student loans, and cancer treatments with low-fat diets, low-impact aerobics, low-grade depressions, a strong sense of irony, a dark sense of humor, and a full-bodied cabernet. We are tired. We are very tired -- we've thought seriously about penciling in a nervous breakdown for ourselves, but we've been through everything the world has to throw at us so many times that it's damn near impossible to get nervous about much of anything. Despite (or perhaps because of) all the coulda, woulda, shoulda moments that have come and gone, we've learned how to have a good laugh, an impromptu party, and an impure thought (or two) on a semiregular basis. We consider our options, our alternatives, our exit strategies. We take notes, we plan ahead, but we always leave room for serendipity. We are an entire generation of women who are making up our lives as we go along. Oprah.com: What Oprah has learned though the years . I know that it's human nature to want to glorify the past and preserve it in a delicious, if often inaccurate, cotton-candied haze. But the truth is that part of me (that would be the part of me that now needs an underwire bra and a pair of Spanx) really does miss my 20s. I still had that new car smell. I still thought terrorism would stay confined to the other side of the world. On the home front, I still kept standing up for brides (as if they needed my assistance to stand) while waiting politely for it to be my turn. And because it never occurred to me that my turn wouldn't come, I devoted an inordinate amount of time to trying to decide whether my wedding gown should be white or ecru -- by the time I hit 35, I'd have been okay with paisley. The Web had not gone mainstream when I was in my 20s, so any surfing I did (and coming from Detroit, that wasn't much) was in the ocean. And I grant you, my rearview mirror might be a little bit rose-tinted, but if memory serves, those oceans were fairly clean. Come to think of it, the glaciers were glacial, the bees were alive and well, a can of tuna didn't require a warning from the surgeon general, and the climate wasn't making any sudden moves. Color me crazy, but I've always been a sucker for a nice solid layer of ozone parking itself between me and a death ray. I'm also a great believer in time off for good behavior. I crave solitude. I like being unreachable once in a while, and in those days it was no big deal if somebody couldn't track you down for half an hour. You see, in the 1980s, we didn't know from e-mail or cell phones or Facebook or GPS, and a BlackBerry was nothing more complicated than a healthy treat that was high in antioxidants -- only guess what? Nobody had ever heard of antioxidants. I didn't need a baby aspirin every night or a Lipitor every morning. And I swear to God (that's another thing, God was still around when I was in my 20s), the closest anybody seemed to come to a genuine eating disorder was picking at a mixed green salad on a blind date until it was okay to go home and scarf down the contents of your refrigerator. But before I start turning into my great-uncle Saul, who never fails to tell me how he could've bought the entire Upper East Side of Manhattan for $225 back in 1936 (""when an ear of corn still tasted like an ear of corn""), let me say this: As much as I miss those days, I'm delighted and relieved to be done with being young. One quick glance in the mirror is all I need to know that time is most definitely a thief. Wait, strike that: One glance and I usually think I'm holding up pretty well -- it's upon closer inspection, that moment when I take a deep breath, put on my glasses, and turn up the dimmer switch, that I'm reminded gravity is not my friend. But if time has robbed me of a little elasticity and a lot of naïveté, it's left a few things in their place. Thanks to nearly 48 years at the big dance, a million mistakes, and one extraordinary psychiatrist, I've finally achieved the occasional touch of clarity. I'm getting to be resourceful. I'm getting to be resilient, and I hope that on my better days, I'm getting to be a little more calm, a little more contemplative, a little more compassionate. Oprah.com: How to make your midlife matter . Sometimes I think being middle-aged isn't about learning a lot of new lessons so much as learning the same old ones again and again. Here are a few of the lessons I keep learning: . • It is never a good thing when a shrinking portion of the population controls a growing portion of the money. It tends to make incredibly decent, hardworking, middle-class people sort of jumpy, and the next thing you know Kirsten Dunst is playing Marie Antoinette in a Sofia Coppola extravaganza. • Anyone who looks okay in ochre will look even better not in ochre. • War and famine bad, James Franco and spaghetti carbonara good. • What doesn't kill me does not make me stronger. It makes me anxious, bitchy, and vulnerable...but nobody wants to see that embroidered on a pillow. • This isn't exactly an old lesson I keep learning, but given that I'm lucky enough to have my own column, I'd like to use it to set right an unfortunate mistake. Remember a few years ago when we all got together and decided that sleep was the new sex? I've come to believe that we were dead wrong. What do you say we make actual ouch-you're-on-my-hair, did-you-hear-the-baby, jeez-that-was-my-eye, messy, intimate, life-affirming, really, really fun sex the new sex?! Because here's the thing: Between the economy, the environment, and the powder keg that is Pakistan, nobody's getting any sleep anyway -- so as long as we're all lying there wide awake... • Dorothy Parker was a genius.

And if you do not like me so, . To hell, my love, with you! Bravo, Ms. Parker. And, finally, deep into my 40s, I couldn't agree with you more.

"LITTLE ROCK, Arkansas (CNN) -- Carlotta Walls LaNier points out the only two African-Americans in her senior class as she flips through her high school yearbook. She pauses when she sees the picture on a page dedicated to ""Integration."" Carlotta Walls LaNier and eight other members of the Little Rock Nine are invited to Obama's inauguration. It's been nearly five decades since LaNier graduated from Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas. ""It shows how the 101st were on the grounds of the school,"" says LaNier. In 1957, soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division, an elite Army unit, escorted LaNier and eight other African-American students into the all-white public high school. The students, who became known as the Little Rock Nine, were taunted and threatened by an angry mob. ""We knew we could not participate in extracurricular activities,"" recalls LaNier. ""There was one who could have been in the band, one who could have been on track. I was the one who played basketball ... I couldn't do that."" Back then, LaNier thought once the doors of equality were open it wouldn't be long before an African-American became president. ""I had hoped to see something like that in the next 10 or 15 years when I was in high school but that didn't happen,"" says LaNier. What has happened is a new generation of students walks the halls at Central High. Even though the exterior looks the same as it did during integration -- the interior would be almost unrecognizable to LaNier and the other Little Rock Nine.  Student: I can't believe it happened here, but I'm glad it did » . Today, the sea of mostly white faces has disappeared. The hallways are now filled with a more racially diverse student body. Students take a class to learn about the school's history and many say it's given them a greater appreciation for racial tolerance. ""Now it's definitely hard to imagine -- you walk into the halls and you see people of all different races are in the hallway. And in addition, the majority of our school is African-American now,"" points out Afshar Sanati, student body president. ""It is hard for me to walk inside the school every day and see how this place could have been such a hostile environment for nine African-American students."" LaNier is still humble when she reflects on her experience. ""We all knew that we were giving up something for a bigger cause and [we were] happy that we did it,"" says LaNier. ""Because it has been 51 years, I think they were baby steps now. But they were big steps then."" The steps taken by the Little Rock Nine were so big, in fact, they received personal invitations to attend President-elect Barack Obama's inauguration. ""I think the Little Rock Nine set the foundation,"" says student Sarah Karney. ""I don't think [Obama's election] could have happened without them."" Today, many students at Central High see themselves as the beneficiaries of an Obama presidency. ""Him being president means there actually is a chance for anyone to do what they want to do if they work hard enough,"" says Helena Liu, who says she doesn't see race when she looks at Obama. ""It doesn't depend on your race -- it depends on who you are, the quality of your character,"" says DeIvory Howard. ""[We've] got to get past just the color of our skins being newsworthy. It's really about all the things we knew we could do for this country and now we have the opportunity to show it and it's going to come through his leadership,"" says LaNier. ""And, we're looking forward to that."" Senior Chris Bell couldn't agree more. ""This election proves that this America is just not the old America. It shows that America is ready for something different,"" says Bell. ""I just think ... that's amazing.""","Carlotta Walls LaNier, eight others integrated Little Rock Central High School .

"(CNN) -- A polar bear falls through thin Arctic ice while searching for food for his family. A humpback whale guides her calf on a perilous 4,000-mile journey. A herd of African elephants in search of water battles a sandstorm in the Kalahari Desert. ""Earth,"" a documentary in theaters Wednesday, follows families of polar bears and other animals. These dramatic scenes await viewers in ""Earth,"" a feature-length documentary hitting theaters Wednesday for Earth Day. For British filmmakers Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield, surveying the whole planet for Earth's most exotic species and magnificent landscapes was a daunting task. ""We wanted to tell an epic story about the whole planet,"" co-director Fothergill told CNN in an interview. ""We spent a record 2,000 days in the field. We filmed in 46 countries worldwide, on every continent."" Fothergill and Linfield shot the footage for the film while making ""Planet Earth,"" the Emmy-award-winning nature series that aired on the BBC and the Discovery Channel in 2007.  See photos from ""Planet Earth"" » . But the filmmakers say ""Earth"" is not just a remix of the previous project. ""The movie has over 40 percent original footage. It has a very distinctly different story line than the TV series,"" said Fothergill, who believes small TV screens don't do justice to the images he and Linfield captured.  Watch directors give behind-the-scenes look at 'Earth' » . ""It's very hard [on TV] to give people a true sense of what it's like to be there,"" he said. ""What we think is very special about the movie is its surround sound. When the lions roar, you get a real feeling for being there."" ""Earth"" is the first of a series of movies set to be released under the newly branded Disneynature label -- a spin-off of ""True-Life Adventure,"" Disney's first nature documentary series of the '40s and '50s. Nature movies have made a big impression on national and international audiences in recent years. The 2005 documentary ""March of the Penguins"" cost roughly $3 million to make and sold over $127.4 million in tickets worldwide. Disney plans to release one feature-length film a year. The next one is ""Oceans"" in 2010 followed by ""Big Cats"" and ""Chimpanzees."" In honor of Earth Day 2009, Disney promised to plant a tree for each person who goes to see the movie on its opening weekend. ""Earth"" examines the resilience of life in the face of ever-present danger through three stories of mothers and their young: polar bears in the Arctic, elephants in Africa's Kalahari Desert and humpback whales in the tropical oceans. Thirty-nine other exotic species from all corners of the world get supporting roles. The film is narrated by James Earl Jones, and George Fenton composed the score, which is performed by the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. iReport.com: Tell us about nature and environmental issues near you . Over the course of five years, the filmmakers collected video footage from some of the most remote places on the planet, including the Aurora Australis in Antarctica, the peaks of the Himalayas, and the tropical birds of Papua New Guinea, to reveal the earth's intrinsic beauty and harsh realities. Central to the movie's storyline is the constant tug-of-war between the animal ""actors"" and their ever-changing environment.  See iReporters' photos and video of local ecological issues » . ""Although the elephants and the humpback whales and polar bears are the animal stars, the other big star of the movie is the earth -- the planet itself,"" said Fothergill. ""Really the one thing that unites all of our planet and all the animals that live on it is the seasonality of it."" Without the earth's 23.5-degree tilt to the sun there would be no seasons, no variation in daylight and darkness, said Fothergill. Fothergill and Linfield used state-of-the-art camera technology to capture nature's predator-prey interplay from great distances without disrupting the hunt. Aerial shots of the elephant herd, for example, were shot using a gyro-stabilized Cineflex aerial camera system mounted to the bottom of a helicopter. ""A lot of the breathtaking cinematography in the movie was only achieved through this special camera system,"" Fothergill said. ""We were ... almost a mile away from our action and we could still get all the close-ups we needed."" The filmmakers used this technology to film a sequence of a wolf chasing a herd of caribou. ""Wolves are very shy animals and they run very fast. If you are on the ground, you can never keep up with the action. We filmed the whole hunt from our helicopters and because we were flying so high, the wolves could hardly hear us,"" added Fothergill. The filmmakers also used infrared cameras to film a dramatic nighttime sequence of 30 lions in Botswana joining forces to attack an elephant. Fothergill and Linfield couldn't use lights or normal cameras because they would have frightened away the animals. ""Probably the most dangerous single situation was filming the lions at night attacking the elephant,"" Fothergill said. ""Apart from the woman who was looking through an infrared sensitive camera, nobody else could see anything. We were right in the middle of the action and there was a constant concern that the elephants would come charging through our vehicle. That was pretty hairy."" Another high-speed, high-definition camera, originally developed to film car crash tests, was used to capture an eye-popping scene of a Great White shark leaping out of the water to devour a seal in midair. The camera was able to film shots at 1,000 frames per second, slowing shots by as much as 40 times their original speed. The images were captured directly onto a computer allowing for an endless stream of video while maintaining the detail and clarity of the shot. ""In normal speeds it's gone in seconds, but in slow motion, when you see it lasting 40 seconds to a minute, you get a real sense of the beauty, the scale and the size and power of that shot which is exactly what we wanted,"" Fothergill said. Not a single image in the film was computer generated, Fothergill said. Time-lapse camera technology allowed the filmmakers to condense a year's worth of seasonal changes into a seamless 30-second shot. Fothergill says his formula for movie-making success is simple: ""A lot of waiting around, a lot of patience and a lot of failure."" The filmmaker believes those failures -- missed opportunities, days of waiting for animals to appear -- paid off in the end. He hopes audiences will be entertained while escaping into the wonders of a world they don't often see. ""We wanted to give people this wonderful journey and say, 'Look, it's a really beautiful planet and it's still ... worth preserving.""","""Earth,"" a movie about animals and their dramatic journeys, hits theaters Earth Day .

"HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- Director Antoine Fuqua, the force behind films such as ""Training Day"" and ""Shooter,"" turned his focus to creating CNN's exclusive short film ""From MLK to Today,"" which airs at 7 p.m. ET Monday. Filmmaker Antoine Fuqua, 43, says he didn't believe he would see an African-American president in his lifetime. Before flying off to the Sundance Film Festival to premiere his latest action-thriller, ""Brooklyn's Finest,"" starring Richard Gere, Ethan Hawke and Don Cheadle, Fuqua, 43, stopped by the CNN newsroom in Hollywood to discuss the making of this film. He outlined his vision for the piece, which chronicles America's civil rights journey from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Barack Obama. CNN: As a filmmaker, you work with people like Don Cheadle, Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington. Why are you sitting here in our edit bay doing this project? Antoine Fuqua: Because it's Martin Luther King, and because it's Barack Obama's story. And because it's CNN. It's important to be a part of history, and a part of inspiring people today. I think this is one of the biggest times in my life -- besides my children. So why wouldn't I be here? What else would I be doing except flying to Sundance to promote my movie! [Laughs]  Watch a clip from ""From MLK to Today"" » . CNN: You were born in the '60s, so you were very young during the civil rights movement. You were barely out of diapers when Martin Luther King was assassinated. Fuqua: I am familiar with the history because I love history. African-Americans -- I feel we cannot ever forget our past. Not in an angry or negative way -- just to know where we come from, so we get a better sense of where we're going, and how to get there, and what not to do. I don't think you can ever forget Martin Luther King and many other people who sacrificed, whose names we don't even know. CNN: What do you remember from your childhood? Fuqua: I remember being afraid at times. I remember the Black Panthers. When I was a little boy, the men that were around me were part of a movement. There was a lot of tension. There were a lot of weapons around. There was talk of FBI. I was a little kid, you know -- 6, 5 years old. I didn't really know what it meant. But there was a lot of fear -- a lot of fear of police, or of leaving your neighborhood. CNN: Did you experience much racism growing up in Pittsburgh? Fuqua: I remember a lot of racism. I mean, we used to get beat up by the police. We used to go to certain areas, and cops would slap you around, and grab you by your collar and treat you a certain way. I remember getting on a bus and drivers would treat us disrespectfully, assuming we were going to misbehave. And we were just going to school. I got into fights at school. ... No real reason, except for color of the skin. I don't think they even understood really. CNN: Did you understand? Fuqua: Not really. I didn't really understand it. I was used to it. I had an understanding of it at that age, which was I was black and they were white, and I was poor and they had money. CNN: Did you think there were certain things you couldn't accomplish because you were black? What about being a director? Fuqua: When I was a little kid, I used to sleep in my grandmother's basement, and I would read magazines, and books and things -- and I would dream of places I would go. I remember thinking, ""Well, if it's just a matter of money to leave my neighborhood, then I have to make money."" Then I read something about craftsmanship -- which is not a word you used often in that time in the ghettos. If you learn a craft, then you can make a living for the rest of your life. So I went to school to be an electrical engineer. And when I was in school, I took a Baroque art class. They were talking about Caravaggio, who was a Baroque painter. Now he was from the streets in Italy, and he used to paint these very provocative paintings of people he lived with on the streets -- beggars, and prostitutes and things. It reminded me of my world -- in the sense of being a young kid on the streets, growing up, seeing a lot of provocative images that I was probably too young to see -- and I would express them, and I would do little illustrations or I would paint on a wall. Then I started to study [Akira] Kurosawa, who was a painter as well as a director. I saw his movies -- ""The Seven Samurai"" and all that -- and I thought, ""Wow, that's even more interesting, because it's a moving picture and you get to tell a story."" CNN: And now you're telling the story of Martin Luther King and Barack Obama. Did you ever think you'd see an African-American president of the United States? Fuqua: Never. Never. Not in my time. I thought somewhere down the line it would happen, but not in my time -- because I still deal with racial situations. Sometimes people don't do it blatantly. They'll say something, or they'll behave a certain way when I know they don't normally behave that way. As a director, you run into walls where they say, ""Well, it doesn't translate well overseas. You know, you need to have a white movie star in it."" There's some truth to that. So if Hollywood's not ready to embrace more stories about African-Americans -- and that's based on the money that the movies make -- then would the country really be ready to embrace a president? You know, the CEO of the country? And obviously, we are. We are ready. CNN: As a director, you have this story about an unbelievable presidential election, where a first-term senator wins. Would you have cast Barack Obama in that role? Fuqua: In a heartbeat, in a heartbeat. He's like a movie star. Look at the guy. He's dashing, he's charming, he's got a little swagger about him. He reminds me of Denzel in their way. [Fuqua directed Washington in the 2001 action-thriller ""Training Day.""] I was with Denzel over Christmas, and they're very similar -- their mannerisms at times. CNN: In the short film you're directing for us, you've drawn the parallel between Obama and Martin Luther King. Fuqua: It is the passing of the torch between Martin Luther King and Barack Obama. I think Barack Obama is the ""dream."" I mean, we're all the dream. I think it's a bigger picture than one man. CNN: What's the message you want to convey with your short film? Fuqua: Hope. A sense of the past. But more than anything, I would love people to walk away feeling like we've just begun.","Director Antoine Fuqua is filmmaker behind CNN's ""From MLK to Today""

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A Russian naval ship rescued a Dutch container vessel under attack by suspected Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden, the head of the International Maritime Bureau said Wednesday. The Liberian-flagged oil tanker Sirius Star was recently released by pirates off Somalia. Two or three pirate speedboats were chasing the Dutch ship, with the goal of boarding it, when the Russians intervened, said Capt. Pottengal Mukundan, director of the International Maritime Bureau in London. He said the pirates fired two rocket-propelled grenades at the Dutch ship, but no injuries were reported. The incident occurred about midday Tuesday. The Russians chased one of the speedboats but the pirates got away, Mukundan said. He said he did not know where the Dutch ship was headed. ""It is important that the naval vessels continue to respond robustly to these pirates,"" he said.  Watch how attacks peaked in 2008 » . Hijackings off the coast of East Africa have become a growing international concern, prompting a number of foreign navies to patrol the Gulf of Aden and neighboring coastal areas. The Gulf of Aden links the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. About 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route near Somalia each year. Most of the attacks are blamed on pirates based in largely lawless Somalia, a country racked by poverty and conflict. Watch CNN's exclusive interview with a pirate . According to the United Nations, there were 115 reported pirate attacks off the Somali coast in 2008, including 46 successful hijackings. Read blog on how CNN contacted a pirate . The troubling rise in Somali piracy has led the United Nations to step up efforts to tackle the crime. The first U.N. group to address piracy met Wednesday in New York. Mark Kimmitt, U.S. assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs chaired the ""contact group"" of two dozen nations and five multi-national organizations. He said the group was formed to ""establish a counter-piracy coordination mechanism,"" and the members believe more can be done to halt piracy. Still, Kimmitt noted that less than one percent of manifests off the Somali coast are attacked by pirates and only 50 percent of those have crew and passengers taken hostage. The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution in December expanding counter-piracy measures off the Horn of Africa, including a stipulation that allows national and regional military forces to chase pirates onshore in Somalia when in ""hot pursuit.""","NEW: First United Nations group to address piracy meets in New York .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The death of actress Natasha Richardson, who sustained a fatal head injury while skiing, has reignited the perennial debate around the safety of the sport. Head injuries are the most common cause of death among skiers . The 45 year-old died Wednesday, two days after falling on a beginners slope while having a private lesson at Canada's Mont Tremblant resort. While full details of the circumstances surrounding Richardson's death are not yet known, head injuries are the most common cause of fatalities among skiers worldwide. ""A typical death is a high speed collision with a static object after losing control -- a tree or a person,"" Dr Mike Langran a GP who works in Aviemore, Scotland and runs Ski-injury.com told CNN. ""Most ski deaths involve multi-trauma, but a head injury is by far the most common reason. ""There might be injuries to the abdomen or the chest or the neck but there nearly always is a head trauma as well."" However, Langran, along with many other industry experts, maintains that skiing is a relatively safe sport. ""I don't regard skiing and snowboarding as a dangerous sport,"" he said. ""It's like many activities in life -- there are people who do silly things but in general these sports are safe."" There are an estimated 200 million skiers in the world, and in the U.S. (one of the few countries to keep reliable data on skiers and ski injuries) an estimated 55 million people ski. Each year there are 39 deaths, which equates to about 2 deaths per million skiers. While children and beginners are most at risk of being injured while skiing, it's those more experienced on the slopes who are most likely to be involved in a fatal accident. ""When you look at fatalities it does tend to be younger males and often of better skiing ability who are maybe pushing limits a little bit harder, traveling a little bit faster,"" Langran said. In Austria, earlier this year a huge debate over the safety of skiing was sparked by a high-profile incident on the slopes, which involved a German politician. Deiter Althaus, minister-president of Thuringia state was charged with manslaughter after colliding with another skier, Beata Christandl, a 41 year-old Slovakian mother of four, who later died from multiple head injuries. He was accused by Austrian prosecutors of entering onto a slope against the direction of traffic while skiing at high speed. Althaus was left with a fractured skull and has no recollection of the accident. Althaus' accident may be typical of the kind that cause deaths in skiers but, The Austria Ski Federation says Althaus' case is very unusual. Each year, an estimated 10 million people ski in Austria's resorts and there are between 10 and 50 deaths during this time, according to Thomas Woldrich, Head of Leisure Skiing at the federation. ""There's a minimal risk to get hurt when skiing,"" Woldrich told CNN. ""When you're skiing approximately 14 days a year, the risk of having an injury is one in 55 years."" Even so, a law was recently passed in Austria making it compulsory for children to wear helmets on Austrian ski slopes. ""We do have an extraordinary trend towards wearing helmets,"" said Woldrich. ""We have, especially among children, almost 100 percent of skiers wearing helmets on Austrian ski slopes."" Whether or not skiers should be forced by law to wear helmets is a debate that continues energetically in many countries. The big question is do they make skiers safer. Langran says that while there is evidence to suggest that helmets will provide a moderate degree of protection for low speed impacts, there is no evidence for high speed collisions. ""As far as I'm aware there is no evidence that for high speed impacts -- you're talking about 30 mph plus impacts, which sounds a lot but that's the average speed of a good intermediate skier on the slopes -- there's no evidence that if you hit a tree at that kind of speed a helmet will protect you against a fatality."" Indeed, there is evidence that wearing a helmet can give some skiers a feeling of invincibility, which can make them ski faster and more recklessly. So, what can skiers do to make themselves safer? It's all about knowing the risks and making informed choices, according to Sean Langmuir, a trained ski instructor who has coached both the Canadian National Ski Team and the British National Ski Team. ""People need to be better informed but they need to seek out that information for themselves,"" said Langmuir who is also Training Manager for British Association of Snowsport Instructors (BASI). ""A lot of people go on ski holidays and they can't ski very well and they won't go for a lesson immediately. It can help so much to get all that basic information."" It is also important to have properly fitting equipment, according to Langmuir. ""It's not just a helmet, it can be the skis or the snowboard that you use can make a big difference to how you manage to control yourself.

Skiers can also refer to the the International Ski Federation (FIS) Rules of Conduct as a guide for safety on the slopes.

"(CNN) -- Nine Hutu tribal fighters and several Rwandan and Congolese troops were killed in fighting in eastern Congo, a United Nations spokesman said, as the two governments continued an unprecedented partnership to combat ethnic violence. Laurent Nkunda, seen here in November 2008, was reportedly arrested last week in Rwanda. The fighting against the Hutus in the Lubero region came a day after Congolese rebel leader Laurent Nkunda, of the rival Tutsi ethnic group, was arrested by Rwandan authorities. U.N. spokesman Jean Paul Deitrich told CNN on Saturday that no further details about the fighting were immediately available. Lubero is about 200 kilometers (124 miles) northeast of Goma, the regional capital. Nkunda's arrest early Friday raised hopes for peace in the war-ravaged region. International observers hope it will lead the roughly 1,500 fighters that follow him to join with government forces.  Hear how Nkunda tried to flee capture » . Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo have traditionally been on different sides of the conflict in eastern Congo -- which pits ethnic Tutsis, supported by Rwanda, against Congo-backed Hutus. The fighting is effectively an extension of the Rwandan genocide of the early 1990s, when hundreds of thousands of Rwandans were killed in ethnic battles between minority Tutsi and majority Hutu. A United Nations report last month accused Rwanda and Congo of fighting a proxy war in the region, using the ethnic groups. It said both sides had used child soldiers, and committed executions and rape, in the conflict. CNN's Katy Byron contributed to this report.","Fighting comes day after  Rwanda arrests Tutsi rebel leader, Laurent Nkunda .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- Pakistan's fired chief justice was reinstated in a flag-raising ceremony at his house Sunday after the government bowed to protesters' demands following days of massive demonstrations. Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry will not renew his oath of office. The flag-raising was ceremonial. Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry will not renew his oath of office because his firing by former President Pervez Musharraf was deemed illegal. About 100 people gathered outside Chaudhry's residence, some dancing, some beating drums in a boisterous celebration. A growing protest movement had demanded that Chaudhry and other judges that Musharraf fired be re-seated. Buckling under pressure, the government of current President Asif Ali Zardari agreed. Along with Chaudhry, most of the sixty others who had been fired have also returned to their posts.  Watch people cheer after Chaudhry is reinstated » . Two unresolved matters will immediately test Chaudhry on his return to office: . Some experts have surmised that one reason Zardari delayed acting on Chaudhry's return is because the Supreme Court wanted to look into the amnesty. Both Zardari and his late wife, one-time Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, had been granted amnesty by Musharraf so they could return from exile in 2007 and participate in elections. The couple faced numerous charges of corruption. Bhutto was assassinated during a campaign rally. Her husband became head of her party and the new president of Pakistan. Zardari promised to reinstate the judges within 30 days of taking office. The deadline came and went. The political turmoil in Pakistan came just a year after the country celebrated a return to democracy. It has forced the government's attention away from a deadly fundamentalist insurgency in its tribal areas and an economy that is on the verge of collapse. The Obama administration Monday praised the Pakistani government's decision to reinstate Chaudhry, with the State Department saying the move ""brought Pakistan back from the brink.""

"(CNN) -- According to a Russian proverb, God makes the priests. Jesters come from the devil. Heath Ledger dominates as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight"" in a performance already garnering raves. You won't have any trouble believing that aphorism when you see Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's hotly anticipated and often brilliantly executed follow-up to ""Batman Begins."" His face caked in cracked white greasepaint, his smile a grotesque red lipstick scar, kohl rimming his eyes, the Joker is a cruel kind of clown, the kind that is only interested in the last laugh. Slouched in his purple suit, Ledger gives him a lopsided shuffle, a permanently craning neck and an insinuating, deceptively neighborly voice. But there's something reptilian about the way his tongue flicks through his pursed lips like a pickpocket. He's hungry for trouble, a maniac for mayhem -- and in Gotham City, where crime is still running wild, he can make himself right at home. Ledger dominates this movie as a living presence, a live wire, dangerous and unpredictable. It's an astonishing performance, as extravagant and free (""deranged"" might be a better word) as his Ennis Del Mar in ""Brokeback Mountain"" was inhibited and tongue-tied.  See how Ledger made the Joker his own » . And ""The Dark Knight"" takes him -- and its world -- very seriously. Even more than Batman himself, the Joker would usually scream ""camp"" (and has in the TV series and other movies) but Nolan refuses to go there. His Gotham is cement and glass, a ""real"" city not so different from what we might find in any contemporary action thriller. (Chicago doubles for Batman's metropolis.) Unlike Tim Burton or Joel Schumacher, who directed previous Batman films, Nolan favors location work over studio artifice, and he seems determined to keep the computer-generated imagery within the bounds of gravity. Even the fetishistic attention to Batman's toys -- his suit, his weaponry and transport -- emphasizes utility and design; this is not a superhero in the supernatural sense. (He may not be a hero, either, according to the serious-to-a-fault script by Nolan and his brother Jonathan.) ""Batman Begins,"" which came out in 2005, was about the politics of fear, the power of nightmares. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) overcame his own phobia to turn fear back on the fear mongers and restore hope to Gotham. In ""The Dark Knight"" (Nolan must have been tempted to add ""of the Soul"" to the title), the Joker might be his shadow or his evil twin. In some sick way, they need each other. ""You complete me,"" the Joker lisps to Batman, mimicking (mocking?) ""Jerry Maguire.""  Watch co-stars defend Ledger » . The word is nowhere stated, but this Joker is unmistakably a terrorist -- he blows up hospitals, rigs bombs to commuter ferries, burns his own ill-gotten gains. (He even manages to put Gotham's crime syndicates under his thumb.) That makes Batman a kind of one-man Department of Homeland Security. And if he has to ride roughshod over civil liberties to get the job done -- eavesdropping on the entire city's cell phone data, for example -- then so be it. To their credit, neither Nolan nor Bruce Wayne is comfortable with this glorified vigilante figure. However, the only legitimate alternative turns out to be a civic crusader, District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). Dent, who carries around a double-headed coin, may seem honorable, but he was once known as ""Two-Faced Harvey."" With whom will he cast his lot? That's the movie's ultimate ideological battleground. iReport.com: Lining up for 'Batman?' Send photos, video . Unfortunately, if Dent gives the movie a classic character arc, Eckhart's disappointingly bland performance fails to nail the narcissism that must be the flip side to his zeal, making his ultimate about-face hard to accept. That's the film's most obvious flaw. Whenever the Joker and Batman are in the vicinity, the movie hums with finely tuned dread and anticipation. But the longer it goes on (and yes, it does go on too long), Dent triangulates the equation, ultimately pulling it out of whack. Still, for the most part, ""The Dark Knight"" is an exceptionally smart, brooding picture with some terrific performances. In a summer when action overwhelms intelligence (and even good sense), here's a movie that works on many levels. It even features the single most awesome truck stunt I've ever seen. And though Ledger's tragic death in January can't help but cast a morbid pall over the proceedings -- and that's saying something, given some of the film's plot points -- when he's on the screen the movie lights up. It's a bravura turn. I'll be surprised if Ledger doesn't get a posthumous Oscar for it. ""The Dark Knight"" runs 152 minutes and is rated PG-13.

"(AOL Autos) -- As long as people have been making cars, other people have been figuring out ways to evaluate what they're worth. Kelley Blue Book offers one of the best online resources to find out how and why your car is worth X amount. In the case of Kelley Blue Book, they've vehemently pursued vehicle values for over 80 years and offer one of the best online resources for companies and private individuals to understand how and why their cars are worth X amount of dollars. We talked with Jack Nerad, the executive editorial director and executive market analyst for KBB.com, to explain some of the best ways that you can evaluate your vehicle's worth. Don't fool yourself . Surprisingly, one of the problems in properly evaluating a vehicle's worth has nothing to do with the vehicle. Think of the computer phrase IT guys like to use, ""It's a PICNIC error."" Which stands for ""Problem-In-Chair-Not-In-Computer,"" meaning that nothing is really wrong with the computer, the real issue is the person using it. Nerad says that some people trick themselves into thinking their vehicle is worth more than it actually is. ""Where we get into difficulty is when people start fooling themselves about the condition of their car -- that they believe it is in excellent or pristine condition when actually if it has two or three years on it, it's going to have some miles on it, some wear and tear."" AOL Autos: 2009 cars with best blue book values . You may have yelled at your family and friends every time they even considered bringing a coffee cup into the car, but it's still a used vehicle, uh, I mean pre-owned vehicle. ""Even if you've taken wonderful care of it, it's not going to be as fresh as it was when it left the showroom -- that's something people are going to have to keep in mind."" Know the true condition . Although you have to be honest with yourself about how your car compares with others on the road, taking good care of it can pay off when selling. ""When you have a used car, condition, condition, condition are the three most important things,"" Nerad explained. AOL Autos: Best-selling sedans . ""So actually assessing your car's condition is crucial to getting the right value, understanding the right value and arriving at the right value. The good news is that at our Web site we give you a checklist that you can essentially go through and it includes things like mileage, equipment levels and also an assessment of condition, which helps you arrive at the appropriate value."" Nerad said that the values KBB gives are estimated ranges of what the vehicle is worth rather than an exact dollar amount because they are factored remotely. Still, an estimate from the Web site is one of the best and simplest ways to calculate your car's worth. AOL Autos: 10 best cars of 2009 . Body shops can help, but a wash and wax might be better . ""Most often, it's been our experience that you're better off giving an honest discloser of the car's condition and selling it as is opposed to doing things like cosmetic changes, which can be pretty expensive and are kind of in the eye of the beholder,"" Nerad said.  AOL Autos: Cars with the worst values . He mentioned that the person purchasing your vehicle might not care as much about some of the minor cosmetic flaws and would rather hold onto their money than pay for a car in pristine condition. ""I don't think too many people who are buying used cars, especially over a few years old, are expecting a car to be in perfect condition or even nearly pristine condition. I think they're expecting to buy something that has a few miles on it in all senses of that term."" AOL Autos: Car cleaning tips . There is a difference between taking your car to the body shop and taking your car to have a wash and wax job done, however. Appearance is still one of your car's best selling points, and you should do everything you can, short of spending more than your car's worth, to make it look good. ""I think the thing that most helps is appearance. It's kind of like the curb value of your home. Appearance is going to catch people's eyes, and it's going to give off the impression that the car was taken care of. If the car is dirty and there are scratches on it, inside and out, if it doesn't appear to be taken care of, that's going to have a negative effect on what you're liable to get for it,"" Nerad explained. ""The good news on that cosmetic stuff, washing the car, giving it a wax job, cleaning the tires, those kind of things are pretty inexpensive to do. Even cleaning the interior out helps the added value. It's certainly worth doing to put your best foot forward that way."" Understand the resale game . Since Kelley Blue Book released its 2008 resale value guide not too long ago, I asked Nerad about the assessment of car values. He explained that cars can have high resale values based on their actual resale value, their perceived resale value or simply their demand. The better you understand where your car fits into this system, the easier it will be to understand why your car is worth what is and how to sell it. ""For instance, a Honda, BMW or Volkswagen has a reputation for resale value in the marketplace, so it helps them to have good resale value,"" he said. Although not necessarily true for the brands just mentioned, Nerad notes that sometimes brand equity, the popularity of a particular brand, can override its current level of reliability, although it's not common. ""What we've found though, is there are really no major swings in this, there are changes, year to year changes and we adjust our site year to year, but they don't really move in a volatile way,"" he said. ""It's something that has a degree of predictability about it."" Keep in mind that your car's resale value is public information; anyone can go online and look it up in 2 minutes. If you let the online experts do their job in evaluating your vehicle's worth, you're likely to sell the vehicle a lot faster than if you overprice it or exaggerate its condition. Keep it clean and happy selling.","Expert for Kelley Blue Book explains how to evaluate your car's worth .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Two satellites, one Russian and one American, have collided some 800 kilometers (500 miles) above Siberia, the Russian and U.S. space agencies, said Thursday. Debris from the collision poses no threat to the International Space Station. The collision on Tuesday produced two large debris clouds, NASA said. The satellites collided at 10 kilometers (6 miles) per second, producing 500-600 new pieces of space debris, the U.S. Strategic Command said. That debris is not believed to pose a threat to the International Space Station as long as the clouds continue moving in a lower orbit, according to NASA and the Russian federal space agency, Roscosmos. ""There is some elevated risk, but it is considered to be very small to the ISS and to the other satellites that NASA has in orbit,"" NASA spokeswoman Beth Dickey told CNN. She said experts were still assessing the effects of the debris. Mikhail Martirosov, from Russian mission control center, told Interfax news agency that the real threat from the debris will become obvious next week, once experts can calculate the trajectory of the fragments' descent. ""We have not received a warning of the possible danger to the ISS. The fragments may descend to the ISS orbit in several years, although I do not rule out that some fragments may go down within several days,"" Martirosov said. The Russian satellite was launched in 1993 and had been out of service at the time of the collision, Roscosmos said. The U.S. satellite was part of the Iridium global mobile communications system and is owned by a consortium headed by Motorola, the space agency said. It was launched in 1997. Iridium said in a statement Wednesday it ""expects to implement a network solution by Friday,"" and will ""move one of its in-orbit spare satellites into the network constellation to permanently replace the lost satellite"" within the next 30 days. CNN is ""one of the larger non-government users"" of Iridium, said Arnie Christianson, operations manager for CNN Satellites and Transmission. ""We do rely on it for communication in high-risk areas like Iraq, Afghanistan, and other remote locations,"" he said. ""Because of this collision, there may be a slightly longer hole in the coverage from one satellite to the next, but only in a very small area and for a very small amount of time. This is a collision, not an internal failure of the satellite or the system."" The satellite crash may result in ""brief, occasional outages"" that may slightly disrupt service, Iridium said in the statement, adding ""this event is not the result of a failure on the part of Iridium or its technology."" Christianson questioned how U.S. government, which tracks all space junk larger than a football, didn't see this coming. But he said the system will continue to work without any noticeable problems. A representative of Iridium could not immediately be reached for comment. NASA's Dickey said a collision like this one is very rare. ""This is the first impact between two intact satellites traveling at hypervelocity,"" she said. ""There have been some other occasions when things have accidentally collided in space, but they have been parts of rockets or parts of satellites and (produced) a very small cloud."" Major Regina Winchester, of the U.S. Strategic Command, said: ""Space is getting pretty crowded. The fact that this hasn't happened before -- maybe we were getting a little bit lucky."" Winchester said Strategic Command tracks more than 18,000 pieces of manmade objects in space every day. ""Any time there's an event that creates more debris, it's a concern,"" she said. ""All countries who have assets in space are going to be concerned simply because when there's more debris, there's a higher chance it's going to hit something.""

"(CNN) -- Shahid Afridi claimed six victims to pave the way for Pakistan to claim victory by four wickets in their opening one-day international against Australia in Dubai. Career-best figures from Shahid Afridi helped steer Pakistan to victory in the first one-dayer against Australia. The all-rounder secured career-best figures of six for 38 as Australia could only manage a paltry 168 in an innings that lasted just 38.5 overs. The world champions again lost their way in the middle overs, losing eight for 27 at one stage as they wilted against Afridi's spin. It could have been worse for the Australians who relied on a last-wicket stand of 46 runs between James Hopes (48 not out) and Ben Hilfenhaus (four) to give their score some respectability. Pakistan's reply always looked on track with Kamran Akmal hitting 48 at the top of the order before Misbah-ul-Haq anchored the innings with an unbeaten 30 from 68 balls. A near-capacity crowd filled the Dubai Sports City Cricket Stadium as the venue hosted international cricket for the first time. The postponed series, which was originally due to be played last year, had been moved from Pakistan to neutral turf because of security concerns. Meanwhile, a superb half-century from Adam Gilchrist set Deccan Chargers on their way to a 24-run win over Bangalore Royal Challengers in the Indian Premier League in Cape Town. The Australian smashed a quickfire 71 and Rohit Sharma contributed 52 as Deccan reached 184 for six from their 20 overs. Bangalore's reply never really got going with captain Kevin Pietersen managing just 11 before he fell to a teasing delivery from Pragyan Ojha and a smart stumping from Gilchrist. Rahul Dravid gave them hope with a thumping 48 before holing out, and Virat Kohli posted 50, but with precious little support from their team-mates their efforts proved in vain.","Shahid Afridi claims six victims to pave the way for Pakistan to beat Australia .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Defense Department will release ""a substantial number"" of photographs showing abuse of prisoners at prisons in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.

The statement released late Thursday said the photos were taken at facilities other than Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. ""These photographs provide visual proof that prisoner abuse by U.S. personnel was not aberrational but widespread, reaching far beyond the walls of Abu Ghraib,"" Amrit Singh, an ACLU attorney, said in the release.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States is keeping a close eye on Pakistan after this week's Taliban surge into the Buner district brought them just 60 miles from the capital, Islamabad. A Taliban fighter in the district of Buner, which is only 96 kilometers from Islamabad. A Pakistani government official said Friday that the insurgents had completely withdrawn from the district by the end of the week, but a human rights group said people in Buner were reporting that local Taliban remained in the district. And senior U.S. officials cautioned that any withdrawal by the Taliban was likely meaningless and that the fundamentalist group now holds large areas of the country with the government seemingly unable to stop them. ""We're certainly moving closer to the tipping point,"" Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff said on NBC's ""Today"" show Friday. In the interview from Afghanistan, Mullen said he was ""extremely concerned"" about indications the Taliban is moving closer to Pakistan's capital of Islamabad. Syed Mohammed Javed, commissioner of the Malakand Division that includes Buner, said the Taliban withdrew on Friday without any conditions. Earlier in the day, Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan told CNN that the militants would pull back from the district. Pakistani Express TV showed live footage of armed and masked Taliban militants in Buner, loading pickup trucks and driving away. Sufi Muhammed, an Islamist fundamentalist leader who has been negotiating on behalf of the Taliban, was on scene overseeing the withdrawal, police said. U.S. military commander Gen. David Petraeus credited about 300 Pakistan's Frontier Corps with driving Taliban militants out of Buner. The U.S. Central Command chief spoke to CNN on Friday after testifying before a Congressional panel about the need for the United States to boost its support for Pakistani counterinsurgency troops such as the Frontier Corps. But Amnesty International's regional chief said people in Buner are reporting a different situation. ""What we're hearing from people in Buner ... is that the Taliban that have moved out are the non-local ones,"" Sam Zarifi, Amnesty's Asia Pacific director, told CNN. ""So the local branch of the Taliban are still in place in Buner."" Amnesty International is concerned that those local Taliban will continue to enforce the Taliban's ""abusive and repressive"" control of Buner. Girls over the age of 7 are forced to wear a burka, a head-to-toe covering that the Taliban say is required of Muslims under its radical interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia. ""I think we're going to see those harsh edicts stay,"" Zarifi said. The Taliban installed strict Islamic law when it took over Afghanistan after a two-year fight with warlords, many of whom surrendered without a fight. They fought with a coalition of some of those warlords known as the Northern Alliance from 1996 until U.S. forces, seeking the leadership of al Qaeda after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, added bombing raids to Northern Alliance ground operations and successfully drove the Taliban out of most of Afghanistan. iReport: Should the U.S. intercede in Pakistan? But the Taliban regrouped in 2004, launching a guerrilla war against the Afghan government while operating from the tribal areas of that country and Pakistan. Meanwhile, senior U.S. officials said that the ""retreat"" was likely meaningless. Control was the impetus behind the Taliban move into Buner, and the fundamentalist group now controls large areas of Pakistan, they said. The officials said, however, that they did not believe the Taliban's goal was to take over the government of Pakistan but rather to create instability by taking advantage of Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari's apparent inability to cope with the situation. Zardari, they said, does not understand the gravity of the situation, remains distracted by domestic politics and appears unable to make critical decisions to deploy the army to stabilize the country. State Department envoy Richard Holbrooke has been on the phone ""nonstop"" with officials in Islamabad and Washington, the officials said, providing frequent information to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama. Holbrooke's read on the situation, officials familiar with the conversation said, is that the Pakistani government does not know how to handle the situation and is looking to the United States for direction. A senior military official, however, presented a more dire case. Pakistan is ""rapidly deteriorating,"" he said. He said that he could not rule out the possibility of a military takeover in Islamabad, although he added that such a prospect was not in the immediate future. As for Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, he said the weapons ""are safe for now"" but that the United States is monitoring the safety systems in place. Administration officials said that the Pakistani military had assured the United States it would not act without an express order from the civilian leadership. Earlier this week, Clinton warned that nuclear-armed Pakistan was in danger of falling into terrorist hands. Before the Taliban's apparent withdrawal Friday, a local Pakistani official expressed doubt about whether the militants would leave, as they pledged to local elders on Thursday. ""Nobody can trust them,"" Sardar Hussain Babik, the provincial education minister, said by phone from Buner. The Taliban have broken promises before and probably would do so again, he said. Militants who swarmed into Buner subsequently locked up courthouses, seized court documents and battled Pakistani troops who were sent to protect residents. The militants said they took control of the district to ensure that Islamic law was properly imposed. The Pakistani government called the land grab a breach of a recent peace agreement.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The British government announced Friday that more than 4,000 former Gurkha soldiers are entitled to settle in Britain, but Gurkha supporters quickly denounced the measure as meaningless. Former Gurkha solider Tulbahadur Pun was awarded Britain's highest honor for bravery, the Victoria Cross. Supporters have fought for years for more rights for the Gurkhas, Nepalese soldiers who have been part of the British Army for nearly 200 years. Gurkhas have fought alongside the British Armed Forces in every conflict in that period, including both world wars, and are known for their ferocity and pride. Despite their centuries of service, Gurkhas were not given the right to settle in the United Kingdom until 2004. And even then the order applied only to those discharged after the British handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, when the Gurkhas Brigade moved from Hong Kong to Britain. The government's announcement Friday applies to all Gurkhas, including those who left the army before 1997, if they meet one of five criteria. It also says around 6,000 of the Gurkhas' dependents may be able to apply for settlement in Britain as well. ""The guidance honors the service, commitment, and gallantry of those who served with the Gurkhas Brigade,"" Border and Immigration Minister Phil Woolas said in a written statement. The Gurkha Justice Campaign, however, said the government's criteria for the Gurkhas' resettlement are unrealistic and too difficult for many of the soldiers to meet. ""Only a tiny fraction of the Gurkhas who retired before 1997 will win settlement rights under the new policy,"" the campaign said. ""The campaign for full Gurkha justice will now be taken back into Parliament and the courts. The government needs to know they will have a huge campaign against them who will commit to righting this wrong."" The High Court ruled last September that the 1997 cut-off date was fair, but added that caseworkers needed revised guidance on deciding the cases of Gurkhas discharged before that date. Under the guidance, Gurkhas discharged before 1997 must meet one of five criteria to be considered for resettlement in Britain: . • Have three years' continuous residence in Britain, before or after service; • Have close family settled in the United Kingdom; • Have an award for gallantry, leadership, or bravery while in the brigade; • Have a chronic medical condition attributable to or made worse by army service; • Have served for 20 or more years. Actress Joanna Lumley, whose father served in the Gurkhas while she was a girl, has been an outspoken campaigner for their rights. She said the new criteria are harsher than she expected. ""They've given five bullet points which virtually cannot be met by the ordinary Gurkha soldier,"" Lumley told reporters Friday. ""This one page of criteria has taken the government four months to come up with. It has made me ashamed of our administration."" She said most Gurkhas are allowed to stay in the United Kingdom for only two years, so three years of continuous residence is not possible. Most Gurkhas, she said, also have not been allowed to settle in Britain with their families. The requirement for having won an award discriminates against the ordinary soldier who has no award, she said. ""This sends out not only to the Gurkha soldiers, but to our own men fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, the most appalling message: that unless you have been awarded a medal for gallantry, you're not a real soldier,"" Lumley said. Only officers are allowed to serve 20 or more years, she said, so most riflemen will not qualify for the service requirement. And proving that an injury is related to army service will be nearly impossible for most, she said. ""How on earth are men who were injured in the 1940s, '50s, '60s going to be able to prove that their long-term chronic illness is attributable to injures received during their service?"" she said. A Home Office spokesman said the government believes hundreds of Gurkhas will still be eligible to settle in Britain. ""We would not accept that,"" the spokesman said of Lumley's criticisms. ""We would say that the criteria as we see it is fair and balanced."" The Gurkha brigade originated in the 19th century with Nepalese soldiers who impressed British imperial troops with their ferocity and military ability. The first Gurkha units were formed in 1815. They saw action in both world wars and were fundamental to the British military maintaining control of India in the 1800s. Today there are 3,400 troops in the Gurkha brigade, operating from bases in Great Britain. Most recently, Gurkha troops were used in the Persian Gulf War and the Balkan conflicts.","British government unveils moves to let more former Gurkha troops live in the UK .

"(CNN) -- Long before fish swam in Macquariums, hipsters got Apple logo tattoos and thousands camped out for days to get into computer store openings, there was a machine. Danielle Brecker found this 1989 photo of friends on their Macs at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Saturday marks the 25th anniversary of the original Macintosh, the first personal computer to draw masses, introduce the mouse and incorporate a graphical user interface, relying on images instead of text. The Apple Inc. watershed product entered American consciousness amid fanfare, with a $1.5 million commercial, made by Ridley Scott, wowing audiences during Super Bowl XVIII. The piece's title, ""1984,"" invoked author George Orwell's message and stood as a warning against conformity. Two days after the ad ran, the Macintosh became available and life, as people knew it, changed. No longer were computers viewed as toys with which to play primitive games or as untouchable tools reserved for degreed engineers. We began to think different. ""The Macintosh demonstrated that it was possible and profitable to create a machine to be used by millions and millions of people,"" said Alex Soojung-Kim Pang, research director for the Institute for the Future, a Palo Alto, California, think tank, and chief force behind ""Making the Macintosh: Technology and Culture in Silicon Valley,"" an online historical exhibit. ""The gold standard now for personal electronics is, 'Is it easy enough for my grandmother to use it?' People on the Macintosh project were the first people to talk about a product in that way."" Pang, 44, remembered being ""mesmerized"" by the computer when he first saw it up close in his college bookstore. He wasn't alone. Read about how iReporters are preserving Mac history . For graphic designers like Zoë Korstvedt, now a Los Angeles creative director, the evolving Mac, with each added feature, was ripe with ah-ha moments. To tinker with a piece, play with the text, ""to visualize on your computer was just insane,"" she said. ""My colleagues and I wonder how we did it [their jobs] before."" No wonder, then, that when Korstvedt, 44, married her first husband in 1989, she used half of their wedding money to buy her first home computer: a Mac SE/30, for which she forked over extra bucks for an upgrade to a whopping 8 megabytes of RAM. Nothing compared to the 12 gigs she now has. ""I was styling,"" she said with a laugh. Jeremy Mehrle, 30, of the St. Louis, Missouri, area is too young to know a world without Macs. This MacAddict began hoarding and tinkering with tossed-out computers, and then he discovered eBay. Today, the motion graphics designer's 1,400 square-foot basement is a museum to Apple computers, all-white and in gallery-style with about 80 fully-functioning machines on display. ""Some people think it's really cool. ... Others say 'It's Jeremy's thing, it's a little weird, whatever,'"" he said. ""I think if I had stacks everywhere, and you couldn't move in my house, people would be worried."" What's Mehrle's hobby, however, became a career for Dan Foust, 38, of Bloomington, Illinois. ""Danapplemacman,"" as he's known on eBay, makes a living out of buying, and when necessary resuscitating, these computers before hawking them online to customers/collectors in places as far-flung as Italy and Australia. So what would people pay for an original Macintosh? ""A complete boxed system?,"" he said. ""I can't put a price on that."" The extremes to which people have gone in their love and loyalty for Apple (and specifically Macs) knows no bounds. Perhaps no one knows this better than Leander Kahney, news editor at Wired.com and author of Cult of Mac, as well as the more recently published Inside Steve's Brain. That would be Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' brain, of course. From his phone in a San Francisco coffee shop, Kahney told tales of people allotting their limited vacation time to Macworld conferences, a man who has traveled to 40 Apple store openings and those who shaved Apple logos into their heads. As for the Apple tattoos, those, at first, really bothered him. ""I'm a bit of a leftie,"" he said. The idea of ""corporate worship"" didn't initially sit well with him -- although he's not afraid to admit his own obsession. ""It's a very deep relationship people have with their computers. ... If the computer's not working, it's more important than the car breaking down."" Speaking of worship, Israeli filmmakers Ron and Kobi Shely created ""MacHEADS: The Movie,"" a 50-minute documentary that'll be available next week on Amazon's video on demand service and, soon after, on iTunes. The film includes footage from The Church of Mac in Los Angeles, where a preacher and congregants gathered to glorify the computer at a service that ended with, ""Praise Steve."" ""Although we read a lot about the [Mac] phenomenon,"" Ron Shely said by phone from Tel Aviv of the two-year film project, ""we didn't realize how big this social movement really is."" And that, beyond the products, is what has been so powerful about the Mac brand, said Peter Friess, president of The Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose, California. iReport.com: Got your own Mac Museum? Show us! Steve Jobs ""really has changed the world,"" Friess said. ""You hardly find people who changed cultures. He changed culture."" Decades before Jobs' health became a topic of discussion, Friess was lucky enough to meet the man. At the time, German-born Friess was a lowly watchmaker, repairing clocks in the basement of Munich's Deutsches Museum, the largest science and technology museum in the world. The year was 1984, and Friess thought a Macintosh might come in handy, so he called Apple Germany to see if he might be able to get one. The answer, as he recalled it, ""'You're very lucky. Steve Jobs is in town. We'll come over and give you one.'"" Ever since, he's been amazed and exceedingly intrigued by every new computer. ""My wife goes crazy,"" Friess, 49, admitted. ""Every Apple computer I buy, the first thing I do is take it apart, just to see what's inside."" For Gary Allen, 61, of Berkeley, California, his interest is less inside than it is outside the company's stores. He runs ifoAppleStore.com, the first three letters taken from his police dispatch days, meaning ""in front of."" The site's genesis dates back to 2001 when Apple store No. 9 opened, in Palo Alto, and he and his son went early. Way early -- as in the night before. The crowds, and natural community, grew on Allen, who began seeing new-found friends at other openings. They were like groupies chasing a band. So he started a Web site, to help fans keep in touch, and soon other Apple enthusiasts began writing from across the globe, sharing tips about new stores, as well as testimonies and photos. The site, he said, averages about 4 million visitors a month. Allen, who guessed he's been to 22 store openings so far, once stood in the rain for days in Tokyo so he could snag the first spot in line. He's seen old friends at openings in Germany and Italy. Last summer, he and his now 21-year-old son experienced what he called ""the perfect storm,"" hitting Boston, Beijing and Sydney. Next stop: Paris. He may not speak the same language as the thousands who surround him in these various cities, but that doesn't much matter when people speak the same language of computer love. ""Apple enthusiasts, it turns out,"" Allen said, ""are the same wherever you go.""","Saturday marks the 25th anniversary of the first Macintosh computer .

"(CNN) -- Efraim Diveroli's father hoped his son would become a doctor or lawyer. Efraim Diveroli, 22, is doing his ""patriotic"" duty as an arms dealer, his grandfather says. What he got instead is a 22-year-old international arms dealer who faces a congressional inquiry for allegedly selling old Chinese ammunition to the U.S. military to equip allies in Afghanistan. Diveroli is president of AEY Inc., a South Florida company which, according to U.S. government documents, has done more than $10 million of business with the U.S. government since 2004. The papers also reveal the company struck it big in 2007 with contracts totaling more than $200 million to supply ammunition, assault rifles and other weapons to the Afghan National Army and police. The company's contract said it would get the ammunition from Hungary. But Army investigators found what the Afghan military got included corroded ammunition made in China as long as 46 years ago. The New York Times reported Thursday that AEY shopped stockpiles and ammo dumps in old Soviet bloc allies, from Albania to Kazakhstan. Albania was a big customer for Chinese armaments in the 1960s and '70s, the Times reported. Angelo Diveroli, Efraim's grandfather, told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV that his grandson is being targeted by ""jealous competitors"" in the international arms market. Since he was a boy, the grandfather said, Efraim Diveroli has known his way around weapons. Read the WPLG story . ""He's a genius about anything to do with weapons,"" the 72-year-old says. ""Ever since he was a little boy, I would take him to gun shows and he could identify every model of guns. People would ask: How can he do that so young? He has a gift, I would tell them.'' Michael Diveroli, Efraim's father, told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV that he wished his son had turned his intellect elsewhere. He said Efraim was ""a boy genius"" who is ""hard to control."" Read the WFOR story . ""I would prefer he became a nice Jewish doctor or lawyer rather than an arms dealer,"" WFOR quoted Michael Diveroli as saying.  Watch how father says son runs his own show » . But his son seem to have a good idea of the circles he was running in. ""What goes on in the Albanian Defense Ministry,"" the New York Times quoted him as saying. ""Who's clean? Who's dirty? Don't want to know about it."" On a MySpace page Efraim Diveroli last updated in 2005, he says ""I probably grew up way to (sic) fast."" But in a hint of where the then-19-year-old's future was heading, he wrote, ""I definately (sic) have the desire to be very successful in my business and this does take up alot (sic) of my time."" The MySpace page also hints of his need for thrills. ""I'm one of those guys who needs to be entertained and having lots of fun all the time so if your (sic) also an undiagnosed case of ADD look me up,"" it says. He lists the weapon-heavy films ""Heat"" and ""Scarface"" among his favorites. A CNN search of Diveroli's Florida criminal record shows arrests, but no convictions, on offenses from misdemeanor battery to felony possession of stolen property. He has yet to appear in court on a March 3 arrest for driving under the influence. For now, relatives say Efraim Diveroli is out of the country. CNN attempts to contact him have not been successful. His grandfather told WPLG that Diveroli is now in Turkey or Albania doing his ""patriotic"" duty. ""He's all over the world getting what the military needs,"" Angelo Diveroli says. But in a MySpace message exchange with Radar magazine, a person thought to be David Packouz, a 25-year-old who was AEY's vice president, refers to Efraim Diveroli as ""my former scumbag partner"" and says he is motivated by money. ""Efraim Diveroli has a serious psychological illness called 'extreme greed,' "" Radar quotes him as writing in a report on its Web site. Packouz would not discuss AEY with CNN on Friday, saying he had no comment ""because of the ongoing investigation.""  E-mail to a friend .","22-year-old arms dealer faces congressional inquiry .
