"(CNN)The greatest sports franchises in the world all share one thing in common: superfans so passionate they will travel far and wide to watch their teams exult in victory. Dennis Doyle has experienced all of the travel and exactly none of the joy. When the 32-year-old New York Knicks lifer first drummed up the plan to follow his beloved NBA team at every stop -- including London -- for an entire season, he had no idea it would be a historic one. Sadly for him, it was historic for all the wrong reasons. ""This is the worst basketball that I've seen this season,"" says Doyle, while exiting the O2 Arena after the Knicks were blown out by the Milwaukee Bucks for their 16th loss in a row. Doyle arrived in London (via Iceland) on Saturday to watch the Knicks as part of the NBA's Global Games initiative. ""I was hoping they would win close to 40 games, sneak into the playoffs and see what could happen,"" he says. Instead, the Knicks are on course to have their worst season in franchise history with a 5 -- 36 record at the halfway mark. The failure is extreme, even for a team that has battled a revolving door of personnel changes and off-court controversy for well over a decade. During the off season, the Knicks hired Phil Jackson to run its front office -- unchartered territory for the legendary former coach. His first move was to appoint his long-serving Lakers point-guard Derek Fisher as a rookie head coach. Both, it appears, are learning on the job at the expense of fans who pay the highest ticket prices in the league. For Doyle, however, supporting the Knicks is practically out of his hands. ""If it were possible I would have left the team about 10 years ago,"" he says, referring to an era that included crippling player contracts along with an in-house sexual harassment charge against then-coach and general manager Isiah Thomas. ""So I've given up trying to get a divorce, we're stuck together ... unfortunately."" In London, he will attend his first English Premier League football match at his adopted team of Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. ""I ended up choosing the team most like the Knicks,"" Doyle explains. ""They are from a big city, but have a history of disappointment. There's something that resonated with me in that."" Rather than sport a lucky jersey like most super fans, Doyle wears an unlucky jersey, Carmelo Anthony's number 7, which he bought after the third game of the season when the Knicks had a record of 2-1. They have won only three games and lost 35 since. ""It's a tough season, so we really appreciate his effort of trying to see all of our games,"" says Pablo Prigioni, the Knicks Argentinian point guard and Doyle's favorite current player. ""You know I feel a little bit sad, not only for him, but for all Knicks fans around the world,"" Prigioni explains. ""Because of course we never expected this kind of season; but by now we are in the middle of deep changes, so I think in the future the team will be much better."" Doyle, who went to law school at Georgetown, received a pink slip from his law firm on the same day the Knicks announced Jackson's hire. He took it as a sign. After talking it over with his sister Kelly, a life coach in Charlotte, North Carolina, Doyle paid $3,500 for a season's worth of middle-tier corner seats at Madison Square Garden and began plotting his six month odyssey. Including away tickets, which he paid for in advance -- ""I probably could have gotten a discount if I had waited to see how bad they are,"" he laments -- along with flights and accommodation, the experience has set him back $25,000. ""It's a crazy amount of money, I understand that,"" he says, between sips of Guinness at an oak-infused pub in Notting Hill, west London. ""But a lot of people in my position will travel the world. Lawyers burn themselves out, they take a year off, and spend a good deal of money. This is my version of that."" Doyle, who says there was ""an element of relief"" in getting fired, is using the time off to hone his writing skills on his travel blog and has already signed with a book agent. A great fan of Nick Hornsby's ""Fever Pitch,"" he intends to write a memoir about the Knicks' season in the same vein, minus the trophy ending. In some ways he sees the Knicks' moribund season as a perverse blessing in disguise. ""I think it is infinitely more interesting to write about a really, really bad team then to write about a mediocre team, or even a really good team."" he says. ""Right away there is a certain interest, a morbid curiosity."" Although the Knicks often trail by double figures early (the Bucks took a 14-0 lead on Thursday, and were ahead by 20 points in the second quarter), Doyle says he tries to remain focused at least until the end of the third quarter. Sometimes, however, the losing is just too hard to take. ""At a certain point, it's like watching a small animal get tortured and there's no reason to continue to subject myself to that kind of pain,"" he says. Outside of the arenas, he resists the psychological pull of returning to life as a lawyer, sometimes from the most unexpected places. In New Orleans, prominent personal injury attorney Morris Bart invited Doyle to sit courtside with him, but on one condition. ""I had to sit and listen to him explain why I was making a mistake by leaving the practice of law,"" says Doyle, who became aware that the VIP experience was a subtle recruiting effort. Even other extreme fans find Doyle's mission unattainable. ""That's a lot more hardcore than I am,"" says Ziad Al-Essa, a 35-year-old Milwaukee Bucks faithful, who flew in from Kuwait and spent $750 on a floor seat to see the London game. ""He got fired, he spent his savings watching a horrible team lose. That's a diehard fan."" Nevertheless, Doyle admits that he'll be relieved once the season is over, and doubts he'll renew his season ticket even though he thinks the Knicks can become a playoff team next season. ""I don't think I'll be able to afford it,"" he shrugs. There's one more reason why he's not renewing. ""I miss watching it on TV,"" he says.","Fan spends $25,000 to watch Knicks' epic losing streak .

"Ray Duggan will be the first to tell you just how tough he was. Raised to never run from a fight, Duggan started running with a gang at 14. With his father in prison and absent from his life, the gang was everything to Duggan. ""It gave me a sense of being,"" said Duggan, now 31. Running with the Young Bloods in the West End neighborhood of Providence, Rhode Island, Duggan says he felt the need to prove himself. ""I had to make myself meaner and tougher,"" he said. He got his first gun at 16 and admits ""shooting people and running away from the police"" were his adrenaline. Duggan thought he might one day get shot and killed. He never expected to get shot and paralyzed. What happens when you don't die? It was around midnight on October 9, 2004, when Duggan returned home after a car chase with rival gang members. Thinking he'd lost them, he was outside chatting with a friend when two men walked by. He thought they were neighbors until they opened fire. Duggan was hit with a barrage of bullets, one severing his spinal cord. ""It never entered my head about being paralyzed or anything,"" Duggan said recently as he maneuvered his wheelchair down the street, pointing to the corner where he was shot. ""It was right there. That's where I ended up getting shot ... I fell into the street right here,"" he said. For Joel Irizarry, a former gang member from Chicago's northwest side, the memory of the moment he was shot is just as clear. On May 6, 1998, from the driver's window of his car, Irizarry watched a rival step out of an alley, raise his pistol and fire a single shot. The bullet went through the seat and hit Irizarry in the spine, he said. He was instantly paralyzed. One bullet was all it took. When doctors told Irizarry he'd never walk again, his whole world shattered. Before that moment, he thought he was invincible. A double life . Irizarry says he joined a gang for protection. He was a skinny, scared 15-year-old in a neighborhood where there were shootings nearly every day. He couldn't get to school without being harassed, chased, or beaten up, he said. After joining the gang, Irizarry felt he was leading a double life. He maintained a good GPA at school, and at home he was a caring son and a good brother for his younger siblings, Irizarry said. But out on the streets, he said, ""I made less than favorable decisions."" Irizarry said he was trying to leave the gang when he was shot. Whether it's drug dealing or gang activities, the outcomes you hear about are always the same, Irizarry said. ""You only hear about death or jail. You never hear about this disability,"" he said. Lifelong disability and health care . For Irizarry and Duggan, permanent disability and lifetime health care are their new reality. According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, acts of violence, primarily gunshot wounds, are the third leading cause of spinal cord injury among American adults.  Experts say young, uninsured men are affected disproportionately. The cost to society is huge. Health care can cost up to a $1 million per patient in the first year alone, and up to $181,000 for each year after that. Dr. Roy Adair, head of rehabilitation at Chicago's Advocate Christ Medical Center, says nearly half of all spinal cord injuries that come through the hospital's trauma unit are the result of gunshot wounds. ""Imagine being fully independent, get a gunshot wound and all of a sudden you're paralyzed, you can't work, you can't take care of bodily functions ... That's what we're dealing with,"" Adair said. Everyday tasks are beyond challenging. For Duggan, just going to the bathroom is difficult. ""It really humbles you,"" he said. And being intimate with another person? ""That scares the hell out of me,"" he said. ""I have very, very low self-esteem."" Duggan lives on his own in a small house that is barely wheelchair accessible. Still, he insists on doing most things himself. ""Just because I'm in a wheelchair,"" he said, ""if I don't do something and have to ask someone else, it's like giving up."" His biggest health threat, he says, is the bedsores he gets from being in his chair.  When we visited Duggan, he had just come home from the hospital after one of his bedsores became infected. Duggan underwent several surgeries; part of his hip bone had to be removed. Dr. James Doherty, director of the trauma center at Chicago's Advocate Christ Medical Center, said the majority of the patients his center treats survive their injuries but are left with long-term disabilities. A high price to pay . Duggan no longer looks at the medical bills that come. He knows he cannot afford the cost of his care. In the first year of his recovery, Duggan estimates, he had more $1 million in health care bills that were passed on to taxpayers. The ongoing cost of hospital stays for bedsores, he says, is about $40,000 a year. ""There is a financial cost for those injured in gun violence,"" said Rebecca Levin, director of the Injury Prevention & Research Center at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago. Because victims are ""disproportionately young and uninsured,"" she said, ""the cost is borne by the rest of us."" Irizarry was 17 and uninsured when he got shot. He feels those paralyzed by gun violence are forgotten victims. ""Every once in a while you'll see or hear something in the news about the aftermath, but not enough,"" he said. Irizarry believes if people were more aware of the cost to society, more might be done to find solutions to the violence. ""Everybody is a victim of their circumstances. ... Whether it's bad role models or just poverty, the help is not there that we need,"" he said. The bystander . Michael Brown, 56, was an innocent bystander when a bullet struck him while he was driving in a Chicago suburb on May 3 of this year. ""All of a sudden a big boom, big sound and then pain like a big punch through my left shoulder, and I lost control from my neck down,"" Brown said. Gun violence, unfortunately, is nothing new to Brown. At age 7, he says, he was playing outside his house in the suburbs just south of Chicago when a bullet pierced his upper thigh. He survived that -- and he survived being shot again this time. But the most recent bullet has left Brown a quadriplegic. These costly, life-changing injuries affect not only those caught up in street wars, but also those who have nothing at all to do with the violence. Brown is a pastor, a high school math teacher and a father who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. ""You know, I don't hold any bitterness or anger. I just want the violence to stop,"" he said, as a tear rolled down his cheek. From gang war to peace . Duggan and Irizarry take full responsibility for their situations and acknowledge their role in the violence. But today, both are working to fight violence on the streets of their respective cities. Duggan works at the Institute for the Study & Practice of Nonviolence in Providence. That job -- and the people he meets through it -- give him reason, he says, to go on. ""I can give up, just sit on disability and just not do nothing with my life and stay home and just freakin' fade away,"" said Duggan. ""I'd much rather do something, and this is why I do the work I do now."" ""As long as I stop one kid from going down the wrong path, then -- bang -- I already saved a life,"" he said. Irizarry mentored young men who were making mistakes similar to those he made and helped those with spinal cord injuries.  He just graduated with a master's degree in social work, and he's working full-time as an admission coordinator at Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital in Chicago until he gets his license to practice social work. ""They say everything happens for a reason. This might be my reason. Just so I can prevent somebody from following my same road,""  he said.

"Nearly two years ago, John Brennan worked hard to convince the Senate that he was no believer in torture -- and that if he was confirmed as CIA director, he wouldn't represent a return to George W. Bush-era tactics. He told Senators at the time that he'd read the Senate Intelligence Committee's summary of its investigation into those ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" and that it had ""raised serious questions"" in his mind about whether those techniques had been effective. Now, Brennan finds himself firmly on the other side, defending the CIA in the days after that report's summary was finally release to the public. He's slated to speak on the CIA's interrogation tactics -- and the intelligence they elicited -- during a rare 1:30 p.m. news conference. It's a stark turnaround for Brennan, and one that has infuriated some Democratic lawmakers. Colorado Sen. Mark Udall called for his resignation on the Senate floor Wednesday, and said the CIA is ""lying"" in claiming that rough interrogation tactics worked. RELATED: Udall blasts Obama, CIA on torture . The early portion of Brennan's evolution -- from a top CIA official in the Bush administration to a torture skeptic as he sought confirmation as the agency's director under Obama -- was on display at his confirmation hearing in 2013. He admitted that he hadn't taken steps to ""stop the CIA's use of those techniques,"" but said that was because he ""was not in the chain of command of that program."" ""The reports that I was getting subsequent to that, and in the years after that, it was clearly my impression that there was valuable information that was coming out,"" Brennan said. Then, though, he said he read the Senate Intelligence Committee's report. ""I must tell you,"" he said, ""that reading this report from the committee raises serious questions about the information that I was given at the time, and the impression that I had at the time. Now I have to determine, based on that information, as well as what CIA says, what the truth is. And at this point ... I do not know what the truth is."" He added: ""There clearly were a number of things, many things, that I read in that report that were very concerning and disturbing to me, and ones that I would want to look into immediately, if I were to be confirmed as CIA director."" RELATED: Dick Cheney says 'The report's full of crap' Brennan, 59, is a New Jersey native who speaks Arabic and studied at the American University in Cairo, Egypt while earning an undergraduate degree from Fordham University. He later earned a master's in government from the University of Texas. He joined the CIA in 1980, starting a career that saw him work as a Near Eastern and South Asian analyst, a Saudi Arabia station chief and leader of the agency's terrorism analysis. He was the CIA's daily intelligence briefer at the White House during President Bill Clinton's administration and served as former CIA Director George Tenet's chief of staff. After serving as interim director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Brennan left government to become president of The Analysis Corporation, a security consulting firm. During then-Sen. Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, Brennan served as an intelligence adviser. Once Obama won, Brennan was considered a shoo-in for CIA director, but he withdrew his name amid criticism of his support for the use of torture in George W. Bush's administration. Instead, he became Obama's deputy national security adviser. When the job of CIA director opened again in early 2013, Brennan was Obama's choice -- despite the concerns of left-leaning groups like the American Civil Liberties Union. He was confirmed on a 63-44 vote and was sworn in on March 8, 2013. RELATED: John Brennan Fast Facts .","Brennan faced questions about his role in the use of torture during his confirmation hearing .

"There's no ""Hey, baby, what's your sign?"" button. But if you have a friend with a mysteriously undefined love life, Facebook may have just become a little more like a singles bar at closing time. A new ""Ask"" feature lets you ping friends who haven't set their Relationship Status and ask them what's up. Facebook has been quietly rolling out the feature for testing in select countries, including the United States. Clicking on ""Ask"" brings up a dialogue box with the text, ""Let (your friend) know why you're asking for (his/her) relationship status."" It provides space to expand upon your request -- say, to invite them out for drinks. A Facebook spokeswoman said that similar ""Ask"" buttons have been available on mobile and Web for a few months for other profile information. ""This feature provides an easy way for friends to ask you for information that's not already on your profile,"" Facebook spokeswoman MoMo Zhou said in an e-mail. ""For example, a friend could ask where you work or for your hometown. If you choose to answer, this information is then added to your profile. By default, only you and your friend can see it, and you also have the option of sharing it with others, too."" Well, that sounds a little less like an overture from someone who's hitting on you.

"(CNN) -- Two secret blitzes. Two high-value targets. Two very different results. U.S. forces launched dual raids on the northern and eastern coasts of Africa over the weekend in the hunt for two alleged terrorists: Abu Anas al Libi, a suspected al Qaeda operative wanted for the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, and an Al-Shabaab foreign fighter commander named Ikrima. American forces snatched al Libi in the Libyan capital Saturday morning. But 3,000 miles away, the plan to catch Ikrima didn't go as planned. Navy SEALs came under heavy fire during their raid and had to retreat -- not knowing whether Ikrima was dead or alive. While officials have disclosed some details, many questions remain. Here are the five key ones: . 1. What's next for al Libi? He spent 15 years on the run and had a $5 million reward on his head. But he was captured in less than a minute by U.S. Army Delta Force members outside his home in Tripoli. The Pentagon said the U.S. military was holding al Libi in a ""secure location"" outside Libya. There, a team of officials from the FBI, the CIA and other intelligence agencies will grill him for intelligence on al Qaeda. Eventually, he'll be taken to New York to face federal charges. U.S. authorities have long wanted al Libi to stand trial in an American court for his alleged role in the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that left over 200 dead and thousands wounded. In December 2010, Libyan authorities told a U.N. committee that al Libi was living there, even giving a Tripoli address for him. But al Libi hadn't been apprehended until now because of the delicate security situation in much of Libya, where ex-jihadists -- especially those who once belonged to the Libyan Islamic Fighters Group -- held considerable sway since the ultimate ouster of longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. There's no extradition treaty between Libya and the United States. And Libya's interim government has called al Libi's capture a ""kidnapping."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry disputes that. He described al Libi as a key al Qaeda figure who is a ""legal and an appropriate target."" Kerry said Monday that al Libi ""will now have an opportunity to defend himself and to be appropriately brought to justice in a court of law."" Ruthless leader aims to extend reach of Al-Shabaab, eyes the West . 2. Could al Libi be a treasure trove of information? That's the hope, but it might not happen. Edith Bartley, who lost her father and brother in the embassy attack in Nairobi, said she was relieved when Osama bin Laden -- also indicted in the embassy attacks -- was killed in 2011. But she's also happy that al Libi is in U.S. hands. ""Certainly, we are very pleased to know that we can have someone who is captured, and for the wealth of information that may be available to our intelligence community and our military personnel,"" she said. ""You can't put a price on that."" If he talks, al Libi could offer valuable information on men he worked with inside Libya, as well as al Qaeda in general. ""He is a big catch. He is going to know about the Libyan branch of al Qaeda,"" CNN National Security Analyst Bob Baer said. ""He knows the entire infrastructure of the early days of bin Laden. Catching this guy alive, he's got a lot to say, a lot -- carrying a lot of phone numbers, all sorts of knowledge."" But some think al Libi probably doesn't know much about the current operational details of al Qaeda. ""There's a lot of thought out there that al Libi may have sort of gone into semi-retirement,"" CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr said. ""Maybe he was in Libya, of course, to start an al Qaeda operation there, but had sort of moved away over the last 15 years from some of his potential activities."" Libyan counterterrorism analyst Noman Benotman, a former jihadist associate of al Libi's, also said his former colleague has been out of the game for a while. Al Libi's wife agreed, saying he was living a normal life and was not in hiding. She said he actually reapplied for a job with the oil ministry. Umm Abdul Rahman said her husband left al Qaeda in 1996 and had no connection to the twin 1998 bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. ""I am sure of what I am saying -- he did not take part in any bombing anywhere in the world,"" Rahman told CNN's Jomana Karadsheh. ""He participated in the jihad in Afghanistan. .... He was a member of al Qaeda and he was personal security for bin Laden -- that's true -- but he did not take part in any operation."" Opinion: Good thing U.S. terrorist hunters weren't furloughed . 3. Who is Ikrima? The target of the U.S. raid in Somalia was named Ikrima -- a Kenyan of Somali origin, a senior administration official told CNN. He has been on the U.S. radar for at least three years. Before dawn Saturday, a team of Navy SEALs zoomed in by speedboat and snuck up on a seaside villa in southern Somalia. Soon afterward, the sounds of heavy gunfire and several large explosions echoed across the port city of Barawe. After coming under fire, the SEALs made a ""prudent decision"" to pull back, a senior U.S. official said. They withdrew, unable to confirm whether they killed their target, the official said. A recent Kenyan intelligence report alleged that Ikrima was behind several foiled terror conspiracies against targets in Kenya between 2011 and 2013. The most recent was a plot to attack Mandera Airport in Kenya's North Eastern Province in April. Kenyan officials said last year that Ikrima had a significant role in recruiting and training Kenyans in Al-Shabaab. He is thought to have been a close associate of the Saleh Ali Nabhan, a fellow Kenyan and senior al Qaeda operative in east Africa, who was believed to have been connected to the embassy attacks. (Ali Nabhan was killed by U.S. forces in 2009 in Somalia.) Ikrima also appears to be close to Al-Shabaab leader Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, who also goes by Ahmed Abdi Godane. Al-Shabaab, of course, is the al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia. Most recently, it made headlines when it claimed responsibility for the days-long deadly attack at Kenya's upscale Westgate mall in Nairobi in September. At least 67 people were killed in that siege. 4. Were the raids a coincidence or were they coordinated? The two missions have one thing in common: the 1998 embassy bombings. Al Libi was wanted for his alleged role in attacks. And Ikrima is closely associated with Saleh Ali Nabhan, also accused of being part of the attacks. But U.S. officials have not talked specifics about the timing. ""Sometimes that depends on the moment of opportunity. You can be watching and then the moment of opportunity comes up and you have to take it,"" says CNN foreign affairs correspondent Jill Dougherty. President Barack Obama gave his go-ahead and was updated as the operations proceeded. The missions, however, are unlikely to help buoy Obama as he battles House Republicans amidst a partial government shutdown. ""I would submit to you right now most Americans remain focused on the economy. They remain focused on the government shutdown and the upcoming debt ceiling lifting or not lifting, depending on what Congress decides to do,"" CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley said. But David Rennie of The Economist said the missions are a reminder that ""even an American president who is domestically very frustrated wields extraordinary executive powers."" U.S. forces strike in Libya, Somalia . 5. Who is next? The operatives of the 9/11 era are largely dead or captured. And key operatives like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- an alleged 9/11 mastermind -- are detained at Guantanamo Bay. Topping the list of still-wanted is Ayman al Zawahiri, the leader of al Qaeda. With a $25 million reward on his head, Zawahiri is believed to be hiding in Pakistan. But some of the biggest targets are part of the new al Qaeda affiliates like Al-Shabaab -- including its top leader, Godane. ""By formally merging with al Qaeda and doing an attack in which Americans were targeted, this group has put itself in the sights of the United States,"" CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said. The United States is also hunting for other emerging terrorist leaders. Nasser al-Wuhayshi is a one-time bin Laden aide and leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). The Yemen-based group is now considered one of the most lethal. CNN's Tim Lister, Paul Cruickshank and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","U.S. forces launched raids in Libya and Somalia over the weekend .

"(CNN)Sen. Marco Rubio had only kind words for potential Republican presidential rivals Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney on Wednesday, but he argued if he runs he'll have better credentials to offer than the two former governors. ""I believe that the central obligation of the federal government ... is providing for the national security,"" he said during a breakfast briefing for reporters hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. ""The next President of the United States needs to be someone who has a clear vision of American's role in the world."" ""For governors that's going to be a challenge, at least initially,"" Rubio added, ""since they don't deal with foreign policy on a daily basis."" The argument offers an early look at what the Florida senator's primary pitch would be if he does decide to make a play for the White House in 2016. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, Rubio has been an outspoken critic of Obama's foreign policy, and most recently took the lead in opposing the President's move to thaw diplomatic relations with Cuba. And with the GOP primary field shaping up to include potentially a dozen prominent Republicans, Rubio's foreign policy experience could potentially offer him a needed boost to break away from the pack. But on Wednesday he refrained from taking any hits at his potential opponents, calling Bush ""a very credible candidate"" and defending Romney against critics who say he ran a gaffe-prone and lackluster campaign in 2012. ""I don't necessarily think there were flaws in that candidacy,"" he said. ""I think oftentimes, we forget that in these campaigns, 90 percent of the outcome is determined by the blocking and tackling of politics. And I think the Obama campaign was a superior campaign operation."" He said, however, he's got the support of his family if he wants to run, and he's ""down to the last decision...the fundamental one."" ""And that is, where is the best place for me to serve the country at this time in my life, at this time in my career?"" This weekend could bring some clarity to that decision, when his top aides and donors huddle in Miami Beach to discuss the senator's future. Rubio's made one thing abundantly clear, however, and he repeated it Wednesday: He won't try to run for both reelection to the Senate and for president at the same time. ""If I decide that I want to be president of the United States, that's what I'm going to run for,"" Rubio said. ""If I decide to make that decision, it will not be with the intention of looking for a Plan B if it doesn't work out.""","Marco Rubio praised Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney, but argued governors don't have the foreign policy chops needed for the White House .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. government employees received improper gifts from energy industry representatives, and engaged with them in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations, according to a report issued Wednesday. A report says government officials accepted gifts from oil and gas company employees. The report was issued by the Interior Department's inspector general after a $5.3 million investigation ""uncovered recreational marijuana and cocaine use"" by ""a handful"" of Interior Department staff, and found two federal employees ""engaged in brief sexual relationships with representatives from companies doing business"" with the department. Two Interior Department employees ""received combined gifts and gratuities on at least 135 occasions from four major oil and gas companies with whom they were doing business -- a textbook example of improperly receiving gifts from prohibited sources,"" Inspector General Earl Devaney says in a letter to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne accompanying the report. Randall Luthi, head of the Minerals Management Service at the Interior Department, said the public had not suffered financial losses as a result of the employees' behavior. Some of the government employees tried to hide their close association with the industry they were supposed to be regulating, the report says. The investigation turned up e-mails in which MMS employees ""preparing to attend industry events used such language as 'this trip is to be kept quiet,' or were asked to RSVP 'in private' by their supervisor,"" the report says. ""When we asked one of these employees why they needed to avoid discussing their social activities with industry, he responded with a slight chuckle, 'They might have, you know, contacted the [inspector general],' "" the report says. The investigation appears to have been prompted by an internal whistle-blower's report in 2006, and concerns activity from 2002 to 2006 by the department responsible for selling the oil and gas the government collects as rent from companies drilling on federal lands. The report alleges inappropriate behavior by 19 members of the Royalty in Kind program -- about one-third of the department. Some have since left the department, making it unclear what kind of disciplinary action they could be subject to. The Department of Justice declined to prosecute two former employees named in the report, the inspector general said, without saying why. Another pleaded guilty to a criminal charge. Department of Justice spokeswoman Laura Sweeney said the department did receive ""one or more referrals related to matters referenced in the Department of Interior inspector general reports,"" but she declined to comment further. MMS head Luthi said only ""six or seven"" employees named in the report still work for the department. He vowed appropriate action by the time he leaves office in January. Democrats used the report to accuse President Bush's administration of being too close to the oil industry. ""The Bush administration put an 'America for Sale' sign on the White House lawn from day one and has been courting Big Oil ever since,"" Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-New York and chairwoman of the House Rules Committee, said in a written statement. ""Democrats have been saying it for some time, but this proves it. This administration is literally in bed with Big Oil. Little did we know they were such a cheap date."" Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said the report should make Congress reconsider plans to expand offshore drilling. ""The rest of the United States government doesn't need to jump in bed with"" the oil industry, he said. ""Offshore drilling will not solve our energy crisis nor will it bring down prices at the pump,"" Nelson said. ""Instead, it will enrich the oil companies and reward the culture of corruption that has been fostered, funded and now exposed by the inspector general."" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said in a statement: . ""This report documents the 'pervasive culture of exclusivity' that has cheated the American taxpayer out of the billions of dollars owed them by the oil companies,"" Pelosi said. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, called the allegations in the report ""unacceptable."" House Minority Leader John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio and an advocate of easing drilling rules, said that in 2006, ""our members on the Government Reform Committee were investigating this problem in the department."" ""Our members of the last two years ... have been pushing [current] Chairman [Rep. Henry] Waxman to continue this investigation and to have hearings and he's refused to do it,"" Boehner said. Waxman is a Democrat from California. Two oil companies mentioned in the report, Shell and Chevron, declined to comment, saying they still needed to review it. A third, Hess, said in a statement: ""We do not believe we are the focus of the investigation and we will cooperate with any further requests from the inspector general's office that may arise."" CNN's Karina Frayter and Carol Cratty contributed to this report.","Democrats: Report shows Bush administration too close to oil industry .

"Late night TV host Jimmy Kimmel apologized for airing a clip of a child suggesting that ""killing everyone in China"" could be a solution to America's debt problem. ""You know, today is a weird day,"" Kimmel said on Monday's show.  ""There seems to be a lot of people upset with me, more upset than usual."" Chinese-American groups organized several protests and a petition drive after the October 16 broadcast of ABC's ""Jimmy Kimmel Live."" The offending remark came while Kimmel was talking to a group of children, ages 5 and 6, about the United States government's debt, much of which is held by China. ""America owes China a lot of money, $1.3 trillion,"" Kimmel told the children.  ""How should we pay them back?"" ""Shoot cannons all the way over and kill everyone in China,"" one boy said. ""Kill everyone in China? OK, that's an interesting idea,"" Kimmel said. He then posed the question: ""Should we allow the Chinese to live?"" While one boy said, ""No,"" most of the children said, ""Yes."" ""If we don't allow them to live, then they'll try to kill us,"" a girl said. ""Well, this has been an interesting edition of Kid's Table -- The Lord of the Flies edition,"" Kimmel said as the segment ended. ABC published an apology Friday, saying the network ""would never purposefully broadcast anything to upset the Chinese community, Asian community, anyone of Chinese descent or any community at large."" The letter from ABC executives addressed to the 80-20 National Asian American Political Action Committee promised ""swift action to minimize the distribution of the skit by removing it from all platforms and editing it out of any future airings of the show."" ""I thought it was obvious that I didn't agree with that statement, but apparently it wasn't,"" Kimmel said Monday.  ""So I just want to say I am sorry. I apologize. It was certainly not my intent to upset anyone."" He ended his apology by saying, ""I'm here to turn frowns upside down.""","Kimmel: ""There seems to be a lot of people upset with me""

"Paris (CNN)It'll be difficult for Paris to celebrate with music and showmanship after last week's twin terrorist attacks on the weekly newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. The violent events left at least 17 dead. For the brand new Paris Philharmonic -- scheduled to open this week -- the show must go on, even when the city surrounding still reels from the violence. Amid unprecedented displays of unity and defiance in the wake of the attacks, the Philharmonic aims to celebrate those who lost their lives, dedicating its debut concerts to the victims. Rising in the northeast of Paris like a shimmering metallic starship, the new venue's opening is intended as a historic moment for the city and performance groups who will call it home. Controversy has beset the building, designed by architect Jean Nouvel. It's gone over budget, was still having its stainless steel and aluminum outer shell installed a week before the opening and has been criticized for its location. It is in the La Villette quarter in the 19th arrondissement, a stone's throw from the Boulevard Peripherique -- Paris' ring road. Against a backdrop of turbulent times, the people behind the venue will be hoping for positive reviews to cement its reputation. Architectural misfits . Eight years in the making, the starkly modern building is unlike most other structures in Paris, but it manages to fit into the already eclectic architecture in the surrounding Parc de la Villette. Other buildings here, including a science museum and the Zenith concert hall, feature similarly un-Parisian architecture -- a group of misfits that have found refuge together. Speaking before last week's events, Paris Orchestra's director Paavo Jarvi spoke of his excitement about the new Philharmonic. ""It's not every day that someone will build you a brand new concert hall of these dimensions,"" he said. A Grammy-award winning conductor, Jarvi will be directing the Orchestra's first shows, which start Wednesday. They feature French artists and composers, including a world-premiere composition by Thierry Escaich. ""Like all new things there is a bit of anxiety and apprehension and a bit of unknown actually,"" he said, admitting that his orchestra hadn't yet practiced on the stage, which was still under construction the week before the gala events. The orchestra currently plays at the smaller Salle Pleyel, in the chic eighth arrondissement, but Jarvi is thrilled about the move. ""It's sort of unbelievable that this actually going to happen,"" he said. Although nearly three times the initial budget, the 386 million euro project has drawn criticism over funding disputes. Some also worry that the neighborhood will alienate older patrons in the west of Paris, though others say it'll attract a younger, less affluent audience, including those from nearby suburbs. French Minister of Culture and Communication Fleur Pellerin has defended the Philharmonic, saying the hall will be the envy of orchestra directors worldwide. ""No European capital will have a hall like this with such acoustic quality or capacity,"" she told LCI radio in December. The main concert hall has 2,400 seats, making it one of the largest of its kind in Europe. Retractable portions of seating will allow up to 3,650 people on special occasions. It features modern, sleek, almost organic interiors that are a far cry from the gilded walls and red fabrics that line more traditional orchestra venues like the Theatre des Champs Elysees. With seats surrounding the stage, the design offers a closer experience with the music. Sound experts from Japan and New Zealand have ensured state of the art acoustics in the main auditorium, the most important thing for the orchestra. ""But it's not an exact science so we are keeping our fingers crossed that the acoustic gods smile on us,"" Jarvi says. Gentrifying district . In addition to the Philharmonic's bar, cafe, five public rehearsal rooms and an 1,800-square-meter educational center, its Musee de la Musique features a new temporary exhibition space to complement a permanent collection. The first show will feature works centered on David Bowie, featuring costumes, photos and other mementos from the performer's personal life. There'll also be a strong family and educational component, with weekend family events and workshops allowing more interaction than that found currently in Paris's big name halls. Free recitals and concerts will run alongside paid events. The Philharmonic's location, in the Parc de la Villette, is also home to the National Conservatory for Music and Dance, as well as the Cite de la Musique, a site well known by music enthusiasts. Since 1995 the center has hosted exhibits and concerts for Parisians. The addition of the new building, however, will bring additional cultural offerings to a slowly gentrifying district, including Pantin just across the beltway, where companies like Chanel have recently opened ateliers. By orienting itself toward these up and coming suburbs, the Philharmonic potentially opens itself to new audiences. But whether or not younger, suburbanite crowds will fill the venue remains to be seen. Prices for ticketed shows start at 10 euros on the Philharmonic's website and books are open for the 2015 season. More details on the season can be found here at the Philharmonic's season calendar.

"The University of North Carolina says that three independent experts in the field of adult literacy have finished a university-commissioned review of whistleblower Mary Willingham's research and found flaws in her claims that some athletes were reading at elementary-school levels. Willingham's research, described to CNN in January, was based on a sampling of about 180 student-athletes who Willingham personally worked with over an eight-year period. Each had taken a 25-question reading vocabulary test on the Scholastic Abilities Test for Adults (SATA) -- an aptitude test used by many universities to gauge the learning level of incoming students. Without actually naming her, UNC released a summary report that implied she incorrectly deduced that 60% of the sample were reading below a high school level, and that 8% were reading below a fourth-grade level. ""Outside experts found no evidence to support public claims about widespread low literacy levels,"" UNC said in a statement. UNC also said in its summary that each expert independently found similar things -- that this specific test shouldn't have been used to determine reading levels and also that, based on the same data Willingham used, a majority of those tested were, in fact, reading at a college level. The individual reports were much more nuanced. For example, Nathan Kuncel, a psychology professor at the University of Minnesota, found that many scored below average. Another expert, Lee Alan Branum-Martin, associate professor of psychology and co-investigator in the Center for the Study of Adult Literacy at Georgia State University, said he was not given enough data to answer many of the questions posed about the reading levels of those tested. But all three, including Dennis Kramer, assistant professor of higher education at the University of Virginia, found that it's possible Willingham misread the findings and inaccurately assigned a grade level to the scores. All three said the SATA test is not a good measure of determining equivalent reading levels. UNC said these three were chosen  ""based on their knowledge of adult literacy, assessment and measurement in education, and multivariate analysis."" When asked why Willingham wasn't mentioned in the summary, UNC spokesman Joel Curran told CNN, ""This is not about her. It is about the data and the methodology."" The findings are not much different than what the university preliminarily released just days after CNN's first report. Willingham and her research were disavowed by the university almost immediately, based on these same claims. On Friday, Willingham said she was ""disappointed"" by the report, and said she will take the time to fully review the ""supposedly 'independent' review of my data."" ""The fact that they engaged in this exercise without ever seeking input from me or my research partner, and without the raw scores, or an examination of the full battery of tests ...speaks volumes about the true motivations behind today's press release,"" she wrote in a statement. ""UNC personnel with the knowledge and expertise to verify my claims continue to remain and/or are being forced to remain silent."" When contacted by CNN, the psychologist who administered the tests to the student-athletes in Willingham's study said she backs Willingham, and verified that no one at UNC has ever reached out to talk to her about her work. Last month, a Washington whistleblower group wrote a letter to UNC, demanding the university apologize to Willingham and launch an investigation into the way it says she has been publicly smeared, most specifically by Provost Jim Dean. The group said it was possible state whistleblower laws were broken. Since the CNN report aired, UNC has asked for a new investigation into the yearslong ""paper class"" scandal, in which student-athletes allegedly were taking classes in which the only requirement was completing a single paper. Attorney Kenneth Wainstein, who had worked at the U.S. Justice Department for 19 years, is reviewing whether it was widely known among staff in athletics that student-athletes were sent to no-show classes where little or no work was required. CNN first reported this week that California Rep. Tony Cardenas is also demanding the NCAA answer questions on why UNC was never sanctioned for having paper classes. Willingham told CNN that the paper classes were widely known and talked about in athletics, where she worked for seven years. She also said the paper classes were used to keep eligible some of the student-athletes who were reading at low levels. ​ .","Mary Willingham exposed how UNC enrolls student-athletes reading at low levels .

"Billionaire U.S. media mogul Oprah Winfrey says she was the victim of racism on a recent trip to Switzerland when a shop assistant refused to show her a handbag because it was ""too expensive."" Winfrey was in Zurich for Tina Turner's wedding in late July when she left her hotel alone and popped into an upscale handbag shop. She told Entertainment Tonight: ""I was in Zurich the other day at a store whose name I will not mention. I didn't have my eyelashes on, but I was in full Oprah Winfrey gear. I had my little Donna Karan skirt and sandals, but obviously The Oprah Winfrey Show is not shown in Zurich."" ""I go into a store and say to the woman, 'Excuse me, may I see that bag over your head?' and she says to me 'No, it's too expensive.'"" Winfrey says she asked again to see the bag -- a $38,000 crocodile skin number by Tom Ford -- and the woman again refused, saying, ""No no no, you don't want to see that one, you want to see this one, because that one will cost too much and you will not be able to afford that."" Winfrey says she asked a final time to see the bag: ""One more time I tried -- I said, 'But I really do just want to see that one,' and she said, 'I don't want to to hurt your feelings,' and I said, 'Ok thank you so much, you're probably right, I can't afford it and walked out of the store. Now why did she do that?"" While Winfrey did not specifically identify the shopping trip as a racist experience, she described the incident when asked about her encounters with racism during an interview. The talk show host is the first and only female African-American billionaire, with an estimated net worth of $2.8 billion. She said: ""I could've had the big blow up thing and thrown down the black card and all that, but why do that?"" Five trailblazer CEOs who reinvented their brand . Winfrey chose not to identify the shop, but the name of the high-end boutique -- Trois Pomme -- was soon revealed. The shop's manager told CNN the entire incident was a ""200 percent misunderstanding"" and had nothing to do with racism. ""Mrs. Oprah said she just wanted to look at the bag, she didn't want it taken down, and because my sales assistant felt a little embarrassed about the price, she quickly said that she also had the model in other materials such as ostrich and suede, which weren't so expensive,"" explained Trudie Goetz, the manager of Trois Pommes. Calling it a ""normal selling discussion,"" Goetz said: ""Mrs. Oprah got the impression she didn't want to sell the bag to her because she wanted to show her other bags. This had nothing whatsoever to do with racism."" ""Who wouldn't want to sell a bag like that?  Everyone would. My saleswoman just wanted to do her best.  She feels very bad because she feels the way it's being represented is very unfair."" Goetz added that Tina Turner was her ""best friend"" and that she, like Oprah, attended the singer's wedding.

It's a search-meets-social networking website that looks more like Pinterest than Facebook, and has until now been open only to invited Microsoft employees and college students. Now, everyone with a Microsoft or Facebook account can access it. The sign-up process is effortless -- users simply connect their account with Socl. They can then start sharing content (e.g. photos, videos, links), and comment on other members' posts. Socl's forever-scrolling front page, which shows posts from all users, can feel a bit random. Also, though the site offers categorization by tags, it's not that easy to find the content you want. Overall, Socl is a solid time-waster at this point.

"A lie about earning a Ph.D. cost a Syria expert her job as an analyst days after her op-ed in the Wall Street Journal was cited by Secretary of State John Kerry and Sen. John McCain in congressional hearings about possible U.S. military action in the war-torn country. Elizabeth O'Bagy, who was an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, said she had earned a doctorate from Georgetown University when she had not, the organization announced Wednesday. ""The Institute for the Study of War has learned and confirmed that, contrary to her representations, Ms. Elizabeth O'Bagy does not in fact have a Ph.D. degree from Georgetown University. ISW has accordingly terminated Ms. O'Bagy's employment, effective immediately,"" the institute posted in an online statement Wednesday. The president of the institute, Dr. Kim Kagan, said she was surprised to learn of O'Bagy's lie just before the former senior research analyst admitted it on Tuesday. The decision to terminate O'Bagy's employment at the institute was made later that day, Kagan said. O'Bagy was hired a year ago as a research analyst, after she had been working as an intern at the institute for a few months. O'Bagy proved to be an exceptional researcher and analyst, and Kagan said she was ""pleased and proud to move her forward."" Last week, both Kerry and McCain cited O'Bagy's op-ed piece, which was published in the Wall Street Journal on August 30, titled ""On the Front Lines of Syria's Civil War."" Part of the debate over authorizing American military action is how many of the rebel groups are extremist and how many are moderate. According to O'Bagy's op-ed, extremists and moderates exercise control over distinct areas of the country, and checkpoints are often set up to define territory. Also, there are distinct areas where moderate rebels are in control and can keep weapons out of the hands of extremists, O'Bagy told CNN in an interview last week. Kerry and McCain agreed with O'Bagy that Syria is a secular state; McCain even called her op-ed ""important."" Initially, the Wall Street Journal only recognized O'Bagy as a ""senior analyst"" at the institute, but a clarification was later added, stating her affiliation with the Syrian Emergency Task Force, a non-profit organization based in Washington that advocates a free and democratic Syria. O'Bagy responded on Twitter last week to scrutiny over her association with the Syrian rebel advocacy group, writing she never tried to conceal her ties with opposition and rebel commanders and is not being paid to advocate her views on Syria. Rather these connections allow her to travel more safely in Syria, she wrote. ""I'm not trying to trick America here,"" O'Bagy tweeted on September 7. Before accepting her position as political director of SETF, O'Bagy had to ask Kagan for approval. Kagan granted her permission because O'Bagy said she would be distributing humanitarian aid to Syrian people. SETF posted a news release online in May, welcoming ""Dr. Elizabeth O'Bagy"" to its Washington staff. The news release has since been removed. It's unclear whether O'Bagy still holds her position at the SETF in light of the revelations about her non-existent doctorate degree. The organization declined to comment Wednesday. According to Kagan, the institute never had reason to doubt O'Bagy's qualifications, and she could not comprehend any motivation the former employee would have for lying about her education. O'Bagy was not immediately reached for comment Wednesday. O'Bagy received a Master of Arts degree in Arab Studies from Georgetown University in May and was allegedly working on her dissertation for a Ph.D, which she told Kagan she had completed later that month, Kagan said. ""I hired (O'Bagy) without (a doctorate degree) and would have kept her if she hadn't pursued it. So this is particularly sad,"" Kagan said. Despite the lie, Kagan said she is ""confident"" in the work O'Bagy produced for the institute, because she and other research officials for the institute validate any research and argumentation that is published. Also, O'Bagy never had the administrative power to enter data into the institute's resource database, she said. ""I do trust her work,"" Kagan said. O'Bagy has appeared on several television networks, including BBC, CNN, Fox and PBS. Last week, she was a guest on CNN Newsroom and Fox News, speaking about Syria. Because of the revelation about her false doctorate, O'Bagy will not appear again as an analyst on CNN networks.","Elizabeth O'Bagy was fired from the Institute for the Study of War for lying about a Ph.D.

"(CNN) -- When I saw these words on Twitter, I couldn't help but put down my tablet: ""They say the smallest coffins are the heaviest to carry."" They weigh heaviest upon the heart. First the Sydney attack Monday, then all too soon there came the school killings Tuesday -- 145 people, 132 of them children -- in Peshawar, Pakistan. Tragedies are stacking up. There isn't enough time to grieve. To spend one minute of silence in honor of each of the lives lost would take more than two hours. The average life expectancy for men in Pakistan is about 66 years. These children killed at their school had some 50 years of life stolen from them â€” life that will never be lived. Think back on the last year. What did you accomplish? How many times did you laugh? How many act of kindness did you bring into the world? Think on all you did. Think of what could have been if these children had lived â€” of how each of their lives could have changed the world. It takes but one person, one moment, one conviction, to start a ripple of change. Because they can't, we must. Those stolen lifetimes deserve fulfillment. Those children's lives can still change the world. But it requires us to be called from despair to action. Although their deaths are senseless and tragic, their potential lives can unfold through us. The smallest coffins are the heaviest, but living for the child lightens our hearts. It is easy to fall into despair thinking about all that is wrong with the world. The joys seems so small in comparison. Internet videos of cats riding Roombas just can't compete with a father talking about how his dead 13-year-old son had wanted to be a pilot. How do we not yield to despair? Action is my antidote. I do something. The Taliban attacked a school -- and earlier had shot Malala, an education activist -- because they are scared. They fear the potential of education to change the world, and move beyond them. Education is the light that fights their darkness. It is up to us. The horror of their methods only redoubles our commitment to spreading the light. We know education is a human right and an unstoppable force. We can use our grief to activate and motivate us, to work so even more children are educated, to ensure that these child killings are the last throes of the Taliban's reign of terror. The question becomes: how? Not long after the devastating news of the attack, I began to see a growing online community, started in large party by people of Pakistani descent across the world, looking for ways to help those in need in. Each is seeking ways to honor those murdered in Peshawar. You don't have to donate. But at the very least, you can add your name to online pledges and join this community in saying, ""Your terror only makes us fight harder."" If you want your checkbook to follow your heart, make a donation to those doing work you support. The Malala Fund is a great place to start. UNICEF and the Global Fund for Children are other established, well-respected organizations that do great work across the world for children. If you aren't in a positon to give money, get some skin in the game. In 2015, the Hult Prize challenge will provide quality education for 10 million children who live in urban slums. If you are a student whose school is involved, apply online before December 21. Apply for a chance at $1 million to change the lives of 10 million children, and through them, to help change the world. If your school is not involved, apply here. If you are not a student, you can connect with your local university and offer to support the team working for early childhood education in urban slums. You have something to offer â€” maybe you bake fantastic cookies, or provide expertise in financial modeling, or simply ask good questions. Each skill, no matter how modest you feel it is, is useful to the students. Help them. We're a world away from Pakistan in geography, but not in sentiment. We mourn with the parents as one people. Now, we must act as one people.","Donna Brazile: Lives cut short by Taliban's school rampage is tragic and can sow despair .

"It's been 21 years, and John Moore still eagerly leans against his passenger window to watch the landscape pass by as the train he commutes on every day roars over the Moodna Viaduct in Cornwall, New York. The green hills and vibrant leaves just below the elevated track make the trestle one of the prettiest scenes on the 57-year-old's trip. For more than two decades, the senior business analyst has been traveling about 67 miles for work from his home in Cornwall to lower Manhattan. His total commute time is 2½ hours each way. It may seem like a lengthy commute, but Moore says he prefers this mode of travel. ""Compared to a bus or a car, it's much more spacious and comfortable,"" he says. As soon as Moore boards, he can start work, or socialize with the friends he's made on the train over the years, or even stretch out his legs and spend a few hours reading a novel. Moore is not the only one dedicated to passenger rail. There has been a 51% increase in ridership from 2001 to 2013 on Amtrak rail lines alone, according to Jim Mathews, the president of National Association of Railroad Passengers. More business travelers, students and people from the Northeast, Midwest and Western United States are turning to trains for their work and vacation travels. Matt Hardison, a spokesman for Amtrak, the national rail operator, says the longstanding rumors from the 1980s that passenger rail is dying have changed. In the past 10 to 15 years, rail travel has seen a significant rise in ridership. ""Rail has seen a real renaissance in the last decade,"" he says. ""It's been a great time to be here. People are turning to rail for inter-city travel."" From October 2012 to September 2013, ""Amtrak welcomed aboard nearly 31.6 million passengers, the largest annual total in its history,"" according to its website. Some rail stations are brimming at capacity, Hardison says. For example, Pennsylvania Station in New York sees 650,000 passengers a day buzzing through. The Northeast Corridor, Amtrak's busiest railroad, has more than 2,200 trains operating on the Washington-Boston route each day. Related: Libraries are dying? Think again . Hardison attributes the shift toward train ridership to the increase in traffic throughout many metropolitan cities in the United States. ""In the Northeast, there's congestion on the streets because of cars and buses and there's even congestion at airports."" He says people in many of America's busiest cities are looking for alternative ways to travel more efficiently. For Moore, traveling via train not only reduces commuting stress, but it also allows him and his wife, Maureen, to live in a more serene environment that is far away from the fast-paced city lifestyle. ""We moved to Cornwall specifically because I could take a train to work. It allowed us to live more than 50 miles outside the city and still commute comfortably to work every day,"" he says. Rediscovering freedom in travel . The portrayal of trains as an old-fashioned mode of transportation isn't a realistic reflection of the hundreds of thousands of people who use them daily, according to Mathews, NARP's president. ""The community that travels on trains travel for many reasons. One is just for nostalgia. But there are a lot of people who travel from D.C. to New York and you won't find a lot of those people traveling for nostalgia,"" he says. ""They are in suits and ties, where time is money, and they can work for 2½ hours."" One of those in a suit and tie was Vice President Joe Biden, who for decades traveled by train between Washington and his home in Wilmington, Delaware, while he served on the Senate. Although a growing number of people are commuting daily by train like Biden once did, there are also those who prefer to ride trains for leisurely travel to see more of the landscape and to relax. Jack Donachy says he and his wife, Barbra, are among those people. Donachy says they're restless souls always seeking a new adventure. Recently, they moved to Mongolia to teach English. But throughout their lives they have had an affinity for trains, riding the Skunk Train in Northern California and traveling via rail throughout Japan and Europe. Donachy, 55, fondly remembers a train ride he took in Japan during spring 1981. He had just been honorably discharged from the U.S. Navy after serving out his enlistment. He was traveling by train from Yokosuka, where he was stationed onboard the USS Blue Ridge, to Narita International Airport. ""I had a window seat and was allowing my mind to wander with the rhythm of the train. Suddenly, a switch flipped inside my head and I realized that even though I'd spent the last two years in Japan, I was seeing -- really seeing -- the country for the first time,"" he says. Related: See why travelers are craving vintage theme parks . Zooming past the newly planted rice fields, schoolchildren in uniform, and homes tucked away against hillsides, he was inspired to come back to explore the country. ""I don't think I would have had that experience, that sudden 'connected-ness' with the country, had I been riding any other mode of transportation. There is something incredibly liberating and thought-inducing about being on a train,"" he says. In fact, Donachy went back to school to receive a degree in creative writing and headed back to Japan, where he lived for seven years, immersing himself in the country's beauty and culture. Donachy says the draw for him and his wife to travel by train is independence. ""The true luxury is freedom,"" he says. ""There are no seat belts and for most of the journey you are free to walk around, or have a glass of this or that, or read, or go to the dining car for something to eat, or simply stare out the window and allow thoughts to wander."" That freedom is a rare commodity in today's travel culture, Mathews says. ""We let airlines treat us really badly. Whether you have to sleep curled up in a ball because you got bumped from your flight or they lost your luggage along the way, we roll with it. But we don't let trains do that to us,"" he says. Mathews says because trains are not readily incorporated in aggregated discount travel sites like Kayak and Priceline.com, the average traveler does not realize trains are a transportation option that can be cheaper and more accommodating than taking a flight. ""I think if people stop flying over our country and start seeing our country and how large it is and how beautiful it is, they'll get it,"" he says. ""It's hard to have a train ride across the country and leave that and not be a patriot.""","In the past 10 to 15 years, passenger rail has seen a resurgence in ridership .

"Baltimore police said they've arrested a suspect in the death of a 16-year-old North Carolina girl whose body was found in a Maryland river a year ago. The body of Phylicia Barnes was recovered in April last year about 40 miles from where she was last seen in Baltimore, where she was visiting family when she vanished in 2010. People spotted the body in Conowingo Dam on the Susquehanna River and and flagged down police, authorities said at the time. Police arrested a man identified as Michael Johnson, 28, Wednesday night and charged him with first-degree murder in connection with the killing, said Anthony Guglielmi, a spokesman for Baltimore police. Johnson was the ex-boyfriend of Barnes' older half-sister, the family has said.  Authorities say he was the last person to see Barnes alive. Her father, Russell Barnes, said news of the arrest came in the form of ""a long overdue call,"" and says he hopes prosecutors can ""make sure justice is served."" Bryan Barnes, Phylicia's brother, wore a pendant containing a picture of his dead sister around his neck as he addressed reporters Thursday.  He said he knew Johnson growing up as a child and that there was nothing to indicate that he was allegedly capable of committing murder. But ""there's no way to tell that somebody could be a murder,"" he added. The teenage girl said she was going out to get something to eat when she left a Baltimore residence where she'd been spending Christmas with her half-sister and other relatives. She was last seen at the Reisterstown Square Apartments in northwest Baltimore. The FBI joined the search as dozens of detectives and officers worked around the clock to scour the area. Police also questioned about a dozen people believed to have had contact with Barnes in the hours before she disappeared, searching their homes and cars. They also collected 40 hours of video from surveillance cameras at nearby businesses and apartment buildings. Authorities then turned to posting billboards along I-95 in hope of gathering information about the girl's fate. Later, officials said they feared she had been abducted or harmed. Last April, Barnes' body was one of two found in the Susquehanna River -- one south and the other north of the Conowingo Dam -- state police said. Authorities said the other body was that of a black male, which was found floating in water about three to four miles away.","Barnes' father said news of the arrest came in ""a long overdue call""

"(CNN)For another weekend, moviegoers will be glued to their seats, watching the grit and turmoil of Chris Kyle, the real-life character portrayed in ""American Sniper."" But for Kyle's widow, Taya, the blockbuster hit is all too real. Fortunately, she's not alone. Friday, Taya was left searching for words after the nonprofit organization AmericanSnipers.org awarded her family $62,000 from its successful rifle raffle. The group auctioned off five rifles from its site. One of the rifles was a replica of the McMillan .338 Lapua sniper rifle that Kyle used in combat, which Taya signed. In a YouTube video captured at the 2015 SHOT Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, Taya addresses an applauding crowd after learning about the money raised for her family. ""I don't know what to say. It's been a bittersweet journey, obviously, and I do feel that Chris is with me,"" she says in the video. Why 'American Sniper' is a smash hit . Brian Sain, the co-founder of AmericanSnipers.org, says it was important for him and the organization to show their support for Kyle's family. ""I think America needs heroes like Chris. He was a diehard American,"" Sain said in an interview with CNN. Sain meet Kyle in 2009 and the two formed a friendship. They discussed working together to help raise money and gear for troops overseas through AmericanSnipers.org. In August, Sain organized a rifle raffle on the site as a way to continue that dream. The raffle ended on Thursday and the money that was raised was donated to Taya and her two children. Coming from a law enforcement background himself, Sain says supporting Kyle's family is only natural. ""The whole community is a family. No one really understands what we do.""

"(CNN)A tenacious Tunisia broke the deadlock in Group B to put one foot in the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations. The 2004 champions were the first team to win a match in the so-called ""Group of Draw"" with a 2-1 victory over Zambia. The second qualifying place from Group B is still up for grabs, however, after Cape Verde and the Democratic Republic of Congo played out a goalless draw in the late game. That result will cheer the free-flowing Zambians, who had created the best chances as dusk began to settle around the tree-fringed Estadio De Ebebiyin. Captain Rainford Kalaba and Emmanuel Mayuka fed off one another up front but shot after shot failed to find its target. The 2012 champions -- who had not lost an AFCON match since 2010 -- had to wait until the 59th minute for Mayuka to fire them into a deserved lead. Kalaba darted through the Tunisia defense to set up Mayuka, who buried the ball deep into the net and celebrated with a series of back flips. The striker's acrobatics proved more painful just minutes later. As he stretched to reach another cross from Kalaba, his legs split wide and he was eventually carried off the field. The untimely injury to the talismanic striker, who is on the books of English Premier League side Southampton, was the turning point of the match. While he was being treated on the sidelines, Tunisia spied a chance to take a run at 10-man Zambia. The equalizer, a tap in by Ahmed Akaichi, came all too easily. As darkness fell on the town of Ebebiyin, in the north east corner of host nation Equatorial Guinea, the crowd raised its voice, urging on a winner. The decisive goal came from Tunisia captain Yassine Chikhaoui in the 89th minute when the FC Zurich player rose clear, heading the ball into the net. ""That was not the Zambia I know,"" the team captain Kalaba told reporters. ""I don't know what came into the mind of my colleagues after we scored. I was shocked to see the way they played."" Tunisia now leads Group B on four points ahead of Cape Verde and DR Congo on two points and Zambia, which has a single point. The second match at the lively Estadio De Ebebiyin saw Cape Verde and DR Congo play out a physical, often scrappy, draw. Cape Verde represent the smallest country at AFCON -- the island territory stretches to just 1.5 square miles --but the 'Blue Sharks' have big ambitions. At its tournament debut in the 2013 edition of AFCON, the islanders reached the quarter finals and Rui Aguas' men came close to joining Tunisia on the cusp of the last eight again, Thursday. The ball was inches from the line when defender Admilson Barros -- known as Gege -- attempted to bundle it into the net only to be denied by the swift fingers of Robert Kidiaba. The Congo DR keeper then stooped low to brilliantly deny Heldon Ramos when he had wriggled his way clear on goal. The Leopards' threat was blunted early in the match when West Bromwich Albion midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu limped off. Cedrick Mabwati emerged as Congo DR's target man but there was ultimately no breakthrough for either side. The ""Group of Draw"" may be no more but Zambia, Congo DR and Cape Verde are all hunting an elusive win in Monday's decisive Group B matches.","Tunisia stage a late comeback to defeat Zambia 2-1 in the Africa Cup of Nations .

"(CNN)This was no ordinary second-round match for Serena Williams at the Australian Open, even though her opponent was ranked outside the top 200. Williams faced Vera Zvonareva, whose slide in the tennis world the previous two years could largely be attributed to injury and illness. The crafty Zvonareva is a former world No. 2 -- and took on Williams on a much grander stage, the Wimbledon final, in 2010. Zvonareva was still a heavy underdog Thursday and playing without pressure, built up three set points on the Williams serve at 5-3 in the first set. Trouble for the world No. 1. But just as Maria Sharapova and Rafael Nadal stepped up when their backs were against the wall Wednesday, so did Williams. She erased all three of the set points to hold. It was the start of a 10-game run that propelled the 18-time grand slam winner to a 7-5 6-0 win on the first day of sweltering conditions -- temperatures reached almost 36 degrees Celsius in Melbourne -- at the year's opening major. ""Things really clicked,"" Williams told reporters. ""I had no other option but for things to click. I just had to start playing better."" Williams dropped just eight points in the second set, an ominous sign for her third-round foe, Elina Svitolina. Williams' older sister, Venus, also progressed to the third round by crushing fellow American Lauren Davis 6-2 6-3. Serena said she continues to draw inspiration from Venus, who was diagnosed with the autoimmune disease, Sjogren's Syndrome, in 2011. ""She's like, 'Yeah, if I win it'll be great. If not, I'm not going to worry about it,'"" Serena said. ""I think that's a great attitude because it takes a lot of pressure off of you. ""She's done so much in her career. She doesn't have to win another match. The same thing for me. As long as we can kind of look at it that way, then we both will do really well."" Another marquee second-round clash saw two-time Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka tangle with U.S. Open finalist Caroline Wozniacki. After a close first set, the rejuvenated -- and healthy -- Azarenka won 6-4 6-2 and celebrated by dancing on court. She's on course to tangle with Williams in the quarterfinals. Last year's Wimbledon champion, Petra Kvitova, beat Germany's Mona Barthel 6-2 6-4. Kvitova is one of the contenders at Melbourne Park this year, having triumphed in Sydney last week. The 2013 Australian Open finalist, Dominika Cibulkova, is flying under the radar thus far -- which she probably doesn't mind. And after getting past the tricky Kirsten Flipkens in the first round, Cibulkova crushed unpredictable Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova 6-2 6-0. Another lucky escape . Sharapova saved match points in defeating qualifier Alexandra Panova, but it's an uncommon feat. Saving match points two matches in a row is almost unheard, yet veteran Feliciano Lopez has done it. The Spaniard fended off three match points against American Denis Kudla, prior to saving one more Thursday in the third set versus Frenchman Adrian Mannarino. Lopez, the 12th seed, eventually advanced when Mannarino retired with heat exhaustion while leading 6-4 6-4 6-7 (3) 0-4. ""I feel very lucky,"" Lopez told the Australian Open's website. ""I think those two matches I won, I shouldn't (have) won, at least not the one today. I was very lucky."" There was no such drama for top-seed Novak Djokovic. Djokovic needed less than an hour and a half to see off young Russian Andrey Kuznetsov -- who upset grand slam finalist David Ferrer at Wimbledon last year -- 6-0 6-1 6-4, but defending champion Stan Wawrinka had to work somewhat harder against Romanian qualifier Marius Copil. Wawrinka prevailed 7-6 (4) 7-6 (4) 6-3. Despite the loss, Copil can take heart from the fact he hit the fastest serve of the tournament at 242 kilometers per hour. In a week filled with mostly positive results for the Australians, favorite Lleyton Hewitt -- in his record 19th straight tournament appearance -- blew a two-set lead to fellow 33-year-old Benjamin Becker of Germany. Becker, previously 0-6 in fifth sets, came through 2-6 1-6 6-3 6-4 6-2. U.S. Open finalist Kei Nishikori admitted to feeling slightly dizzy due to the conditions but still eliminated another big server, Ivan Dodig of Croatia. Dodig failed to serve out the fourth set and Nishikori ran out a 4-6 7-5 6-2 7-6 (0) winner. ""Hot out there,"" said Nishikori. ""A lot of sun. It wasn't easy. Especially third and fourth set I was a little bit dizzy and tired. But, you know, it's going to be like this in Australia, so I think I was ready for it. Hopefully I won't play (in) this condition again."" For Nishikori, the weather forecast looks promising. The forecast high for the next two days is 27 degrees Celsius prior to the highs falling to the low 20s.","Serena Williams rallies to beat Vera Zvonareva at the Australian Open .

"New York (CNN) -- The Korean War began 60 years ago on June 25, 1950, and it still hasn't ended. Fighting on the Korean Peninsula may have stopped with a cease-fire in July 1953, but North and South Korea have remained in a tense state of armed truce ever since, with open warfare just a hair-trigger away. The sinking of the South Korean navy vessel Cheonan on March 26 -- which an international investigation team concluded last week to be the result of a North Korean torpedo attack -- shows how volatile the situation remains between North and South. There is a real danger of the current war of words escalating into a shooting war, which would be a catastrophe for Korea and the surrounding region. But if all sides, including the United States, pull back from the brink, this tragedy may also present an opportunity to defuse tensions with North Korea and resume talks that have been on hold for the last two years. The Cheonan disaster caused an outcry of grief and anger in South Korea. On May 24, South Korea's President Lee Myung-bak gave a forceful speech to his countrymen, asserting that South Korea would not tolerate any provocation from the North and would pursue ""proactive deterrence."" South Koreans, Lee vowed, ""will immediately exercise our right of self-defense"" if their territorial waters, airspace or territory are violated."" Lee called the sinking of the Cheonan, in which 46 sailors died, a violation of the United Nations Charter and of the Korean War Armistice and said he would turn to the U.N. Security Council for international support in condemning North Korea. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has demanded North Korea face ""consequences"" for this attack. But North Korea denies involvement in the incident, claiming the whole investigation is a fabrication designed to undermine North-South Korean relations and ignite a war against the North. The North Koreans have said any retaliation against them for the incident would be met with a forceful and immediate response, up to and including all-out war. China has so far been neutral about the investigation's findings, calling the incident a ""tragedy"" but refusing to blame North Korea and calling for calm on all sides. Without China's support, no call for action against North Korea will make it through the U.N. Security Council. (China is one of the five nations that hold veto power on the Council.) China supported two rounds of U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang, after North Korea's nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009, but is unlikely to support sanctions this time. North Korea denies responsibility for the incident and China regards the evidence as inconclusive. Besides, it's hard to see what further economic or diplomatic pressure can be put on North Korea, which already faces tough previous sanctions. Contrary to common belief, North Korea is not facing internal political disarray or economic decline. Kim Jong Il appears to be fully in charge, and harvests for the last two years have been relatively good. Chinese sources estimate a substantial increase in North Korean industrial production over the last year. Whatever may have motivated the attack on the Cheonan, it was not the act of a desperate or divided regime, and the strong sanctions called for by President Lee -- even if China would agree to support and enforce them -- are not likely to get North Korea to admit responsibility for the attack or to change its behavior. On the other hand, there is a real danger of this war of words escalating into a shooting war. With well over a million Korean troops facing each other across the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South, along with 29,000 U.S. troops in the South, and North Korea now armed with nuclear weapons, the consequences of a renewed Korean War would be catastrophic for the Korean peninsula and the entire Northeast Asia region. The Cheonan incident has reinforced U.S.-South Korean and U.S.-Japanese cooperation in deterring the North. But deterrence can look like provocation from the other side, and in such a tense and volatile environment, a slight miscalculation can lead to disaster. Anger and outrage may be understandable, but cooler heads must prevail. Millions of lives are at stake. Rather than lead to deepening confrontation, this tragedy may be an opportunity to re-engage North Korea in talks to scale back and ultimately eliminate its nuclear program, and to promote security and economic cooperation with its neighbors. North Korea has never admitted to acts of terrorism in the past, and we cannot expect it to acknowledge responsibility and apologize for the sinking of the Cheonan as a precondition for such talks. Instead, the international community should take advantage of Kim Jong Il's stated willingness to return to multilateral negotiations, suspended since 2008, as a way of reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula. It is time to end the Korean War, not start it anew. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Armstrong.","Charles Armstrong says new conflict between North and South shows tension unabated .

"A team of scientists has just finished what might literally be described as one of the most breathtaking jobs in the world -- surveying and mapping the coral reefs in Southeast Asia's Coral Triangle off the coast of Indonesia's Sulawesi Island. As part of the Catlin Seaview Survey, teams from the University of Queensland, Indonesia's Sam Ratulangi University and Indonesia's Institute of Sciences spent time underwater over several weeks near the city of Manado to record data and map reefs in what the survey says ""could become one of the last refuges on Earth for coral reefs."" The effort was part of a larger project to map the Coral Triangle, which encompasses 647 million hectares of land and sea located within the territories of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste. ""Coral Triangle"" refers to a roughly triangular shape of waters between the Pacific and Indian oceans. One of the world's most crucial breeding grounds for marine biodiversity, it's home to 75 percent of all known coral species, including nearly 600 species of reef-building corals and 3,000 species of reef fish. The Catlin Seaview Survey says the scale of its undersea mapping project is unprecedented. Located on the island of Sulawesi, Manado is the capital of Indonesia's North Sulawesi province. Coral devastation . According to experts, about 40 percent of the world's corals have been lost in the last three decades due to climate change and human activities. Assuming the current rate of decline remains steady, some marine biologists predict that most of the world's remaining coral will disappear by the middle of the century. The Catlin Seaview Survey got underway in September 2012 on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Centering on the waters of Southeast Asia, the 2014 campaign commenced in April and has also covered areas around Apo Island and Tubbataha Reefs in the Philippines, Komodo and Bali in Indonesia, and East Timor. Located in the center of the Coral Triangle, Manado is a crucial section for researchers. ""Regions like Manado in the Coral Triangle could, by the middle of the century, be one of the only places on Earth where coral reefs will exist,"" says Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, chief scientist of the survey and director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland. ""Understanding the structure and function of such reefs is of the utmost importance if we are to underpin their resilience to global change."" ""This information is necessary to make informed decisions about how much, and where, governments should invest to ensure the future well being of our planet,"" says Stephen Catlin, chief executive of Catlin Group Limited, a Bermuda-based insurance company that sponsors the survey. How coral reef maps are made . The coral mapping effort employs a Seaview SVII underwater camera, which has a rod and propeller attached to the back to create a sort of photo scooter. Three digital SLR cameras encased in the SVII's globe-shaped lens capture high resolution, 360-degree images of reefs. Designed by Catlin Seaview Survey, the camera's new technology helps shorten surveying time of large, shallow water areas from months to days. Officially called the South East Asia Expedition: Survey 4, the survey around Manado, which concluded this week, covered up to 80 linear kilometers of reef, and comprised 40 two-kilometer transects. To map such a vast area, scientist-divers took photographs while ""riding"" the camera at an average depth of eight meters while traveling at 4 kph. Thousands of images will eventually be stitched together to create a whole picture of the reef system. The images will be uploaded for viewing on the company's database, The Global Reef Record. Some of the images can be found on Google Maps. The team will begin mapping a section of the Coral Triangle in the Solomon Islands later this month.","The Coral Triangle is home to 75 percent of all known coral species in the world .

"The Justice Department secretly collected two months of telephone records for reporters and editors at The Associated Press, the news service disclosed Monday in an outraged letter to Attorney General Eric Holder. The records included calls from several AP bureaus and the personal phone lines of several staffers, AP President Gary Pruitt wrote. Pruitt called the subpoenas a ""massive and unprecedented intrusion"" into its reporting. ""These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know,"" wrote Pruitt, the news agency's CEO. The AP reported that the government has not said why it wanted the records. But it noted that U.S. officials have said they were probing how details of a foiled bomb plot that targeted a U.S.-bound aircraft leaked in May 2012. The news agency said records from five reporters and an editor who worked on a story about the plot were among those collected, but it said none of the information the government has shared with it suggested agents listened in on any reporters' calls. The news immediately raised questions among members of Congress. ""The First Amendment is first for a reason,"" said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. ""If the Obama administration is going after reporters' phone records, they better have a damned good explanation."" The subpoenas were disclosed to the news agency on Friday, Pruitt wrote. In all, federal agents collected records from more than 20 lines, including personal phones and AP phone numbers in New York; Hartford, Connecticut; and Washington, he wrote. ""We regard this action by the Department of Justice as a serious interference with AP's constitutional rights to gather and report the news,"" he told Holder. Pruitt demanded that the department return all records collected and destroy all copies. The U.S. attorney's office in Washington responded that federal investigators seek phone records from news outlets only after making ""every reasonable effort to obtain information through alternative means."" It did not disclose the subject of the probe. ""We must notify the media organization in advance unless doing so would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation,"" it said. ""Because we value the freedom of the press, we are always careful and deliberative in seeking to strike the right balance between the public interest in the free flow of information and the public interest in the fair and effective administration of our criminal laws."" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the Obama administration ""has been incredibly aggressive"" about prosecuting leakers, and there's no privilege in federal law that allows reporters to protect their sources. But he said past administrations have avoided going that far. ""I have never heard of a subpoena this broad,"" Toobin said. ""It's legal, as far as I can tell. The administration isn't violating the First Amendment. But they are certainly doing more than has ever been done before in pursuing the private information of journalists. And we'll see if there's any political check on them, because there doesn't appear to be any legal check on what they're doing."" The White House was unaware of the subpoenas, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday night. ""We are not involved in decisions made in connection with criminal investigations, as those matters are handled independently by the Justice Department,"" Carney said. Holder announced in June 2012 that he had assigned two U.S. attorneys to lead investigations into the possible leaking of state secrets, and members of Congress have complained about disclosures of electronic warfare campaigns against Iran, U.S. drone attacks overseas and Obama's personal involvement in ""kill lists"" of militants in Yemen and Pakistan. But Pruitt wrote that most of the records collected from the AP ""can have no plausible connection to any ongoing investigation,"" and the American Civil Liberties Union called on the Justice Department to explain its actions. ""Obtaining a broad range of telephone records in order to ferret out a government leaker is an unacceptable abuse of power,"" Ben Wizner, the head of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said in a written statement. ""Freedom of the press is a pillar of our democracy, and that freedom often depends on confidential communications between reporters and their sources."" In a statement issued Monday night, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said, ""I am very troubled by these allegations and want to hear the government's explanation."" ""The burden is always on the government when they go after private information -- especially information regarding the press or its confidential sources,"" said Leahy, D-Vermont. ""I want to know more about this case, but on the face of it, I am concerned that the government may not have met that burden."" And Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, told CNN that the Justice Department already has the ability ""to listen, very transparently, to all the government phones and government activities."" ""You can imagine if Congress wanted to know about leaks that obviously came out of the administration that ended up in the press, they would be outraged if we tried to get that information,"" said Issa, a member of the House Judiciary Committee and a leading critic of Holder. ""But that's exactly what they're doing. They're looking at what is considered to be confidential.""","There'd better be a ""damned good explanation"" for subpoenas, Boehner spokesman says .

"The name ""Ferguson"" will enter America's political vocabulary alongside cities like Detroit, Harlem and South Central Los Angeles -- places where black Americans rioted in the streets following the violent mistreatment of unarmed black men at the hands of police. Despite amazing progress in some areas of race relations -- notably, the election and re-election of Barack Obama as President -- the United States also harbors a deep, durable strain of racism that occasionally flares into public consciousness, sometimes with explosive results. The summer of 2014 was one of those times the curtain was pulled back and the ugliness emerged. On July 17 in New York City, half a dozen police confronted a man named Eric Garner for allegedly selling cigarettes on the street without a license to do so.  A bystander's phone camera captured video of the police pushing Garner to the ground using a chokehold as Garner, a father of six, repeatedly said ""I can't breathe."" He died shortly afterwards. A few weeks later on August 5, in Beavercreek, Ohio, a man named John Crawford was shot to death inside a Walmart store after police responded to an emergency call about a man waving a weapon. Crawford turned out to be holding a pellet-shooting BB gun he'd picked up from a shelf inside the store (which sells the gun). On August 9 in Ferguson, Missouri, police killed a teenager named Michael Brown and left his body uncovered in the street. Witnesses say Brown had his hands up when an officer fired six shots into his body. A week of demonstrations and violence followed. On August 11, a 25-year-old man named Ezell Ford was shot to death in Los Angeles. Police say Ford attacked an officer after his car was stopped; other witnesses say he was not resisting and was killed while lying down in the street. All around America, demonstrations have taken place to protest what some call a national epidemic of police brutality toward black men. There's no sure way of knowing whether there is a pattern of police imposing deadly force on blacks, but civil rights organizations have long complained about racial profiling -- the practice of assuming members of a racial minority group are engaged in criminal activity and detaining or arresting them for that reason alone. Such practices are illegal under the U.S. Constitution. ""Racial profiling continues to be a prevalent and egregious form of discrimination in the United States,"" says the website of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""This unjustifiable practice remains a stain on American democracy and an affront to the promise of racial equality."" America has fought a long battle to ensure equal opportunity and legal treatment for descendants of the African slaves who spent centuries in bondage until the practice was outlawed in 1863. But many stories show black Americans lagging far behind when it comes to economic and educational achievement. Studies show that white families, for instance, had an average of $113,149 in household wealth in 2009 compared with only $5,677 for blacks. Educators have discovered a persistent gap between black and white students on standardized English and math tests. These gaps have existed for decades, but they seldom result in the kind of street demonstrations and riots that followed the recent killings in Missouri and elsewhere. That's because poverty and ignorance are social ills that people can battle gradually. Racial profiling and police violence, on the other hand, represents a form of injustice that is impossible to ignore. History suggests that grinding poverty and discrimination create social dynamite -- but it's police violence that triggers the explosion. Adam Serwer of Buzzfeed recently described some of this history, accurately, as 80 years of Fergusons. In 1935, a false rumor swept through Harlem that a 16-year-old, arrested for shoplifting, had been killed by police. It touched off two days of rioting. In 1962, riots went off in St. Louis -- a stone's throw from Ferguson -- when a teenager was shot to death while running from a policeman who claimed the boy had tried to grab his gun. After riots broke out in Detroit in 1967 -- five days of chaos that left 41 dead -- a presidential commission found that police aggression, along with racism and discrimination, was to blame. In 1980, the Liberty City section of Miami went up in flames after a man named Arthur McDuffie died in police custody after a motorcycle crash. One responding officer later testified that his fellow cops had beaten McDuffie with flashlights; when the officers were acquitted, rioters took to the streets. Miami burned again in 1989, after an officer shot a motorcyclist to death (the officer ended up convicted of manslaughter, although the conviction was later overturned). And in Los Angeles in 1992, the acquittal of officers who'd been videotaped beating a motorist named Rodney King led to riots that left more than 50 people dead. Then, as now, the social unrest reminds many black Americans of a time when violence -- including violence by police -- was used as a tool of social and political intimidation. In the 1960s, at the same time urban riots were taking place, police were also used to attack and brutalize African-Americans seeking the right to vote. A famous series of protests in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963, led by Martin Luther King Jr., led to mass arrests and attacks by police using dogs, fire hoses and clubs on nonviolent demonstrators. A similarly brutal attack on demonstrators followed in Selma, Alabama, in 1965. Black political leaders are making a connection between the politically-motivated police violence of the past and the current cases of possible profiling. It was significant that two of King's children, Martin Luther King III and Bernice King, attended Mike Brown's funeral, along with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was at King's side the day he was assassinated. The biggest difference between past violence and the current cases is that African-Americans now have much greater political influence -- most notably, a black president. Obama sent high-ranking aides to Brown's funeral, and the nation's top law-enforcement official, Attorney General Eric Holder, made a personal appearance in Missouri, wrote an open letter to the town and deployed 40 FBI agents to investigate the killing of Brown. The nightly violence involving citizens and police in the days following Brown's killing have stopped for now, but the national debate over the politics of policing will continue long into the future. Even with a black president, this summer's cases show that suspicions of racial profiling will remain a live, lingering concern from coast to coast as long as cops apply outsized levels of force that rarely, if ever, get applied outside of black communities. Will we see more Fergusons?  My guess would be yes. 80 years of history suggest that the inequality and discrimination that continue to plague black communities around America are still a kind of factory creating vast amounts of social dynamite. Those tensions can be detonated by a single clash between police and citizens in a country where encounters take place thousands of times every day. So the odds suggest there will be more times when America pays the price for maintaining a gap between the American dream and the very real nightmare of poverty and racism in our midst.","Errol Louis says racial divisions in America were again exposed by the shooting of Michael Brown .

"Attorneys for a former Vanderbilt football player charged with rape are asking a judge to toss the case, saying several pieces of evidence have allegedly gone missing. And the attorneys reveal in court papers filed this week that then-head coach James Franklin had a conversation with the woman who later became the accuser in which he asked her to arrange for ""fifteen pretty girls"" to help with recruiting. The attorneys for Brandon Vandenburg -- one of four former Vanderbilt football players charged with raping a woman last summer --  say that the accuser told this to police during an interview that has not been handed over during the pre-trial process. In it that interview, the attorneys say, the woman told police that Franklin also contacted her after the rape to check on her well-being since she had helped them with recruiting. It's not clear how they know what was said in during this missing interview. Police or prosecutors have not confirmed the interview. ""Coach Franklin called her in for a private meeting and told her he wanted her to get fifteen pretty girls together and form a team to assist with the recruiting even though he knew it was against the rules. He added that other colleges did it,"" the motion seeking dismissal says. The ""rules"" are presumably those of the NCAA. In 2004, after several allegations of rape at get-togethers designed to woo prospective players, the NCAA passed a rule that said that students who host recruits during campus visits ""must be either current student-athletes or students consistent with the school's policy for providing campus visits or tours to prospective students generally,"" NCAA spokeswoman Emily James told CNN. ""The overall intent of the rule was to preclude athletics departments (from) specific hosting groups , which were most commonly, gender specific."" The NCAA did not say if it will look into the claims made against Franklin in this court filing. ""What is important to recognize about this rule, is that it is not about maintaining a level playing field -- all schools can afford to have all female recruiting club(s) -- it was passed to prevent sexual assaults, to create a healthier environment on campuses,"" said Todd Crossett, associate professor of sport management at the University of Massachusettes-Amherst. Crosset has been an expert witness in three Title IX civil suits involving sexual assaults by athletes, including the case at the University of Colorado-Boulder which led to the NCAA's ban on female hostess recruiting parties. Franklin responded to the motion seeking dismissal with a public statement: ""The allegations that I did something wrong are simply not true. I have cooperated fully with the authorities in this matter but, out of respect for the legal process, I am not able to comment any further."" Vanderbilt declined to comment on an ongoing investigation, and so did Penn State, where Franklin was hired in January and is preparing for a much-anticipated first season. Penn State, coming off the heels of the sexual abuse scandal of Jerry Sandusky, faced some criticism from victim advocates when Franklin was hired, since the case involving Vandenburg and others at Vanderbilt wasn't yet resolved. The prosecutor in the criminal case has said that Franklin cooperated with police and ""There's no evidence whatsoever where Coach Franklin was involved in any way in the cover-up or has done anything inappropriate."" The rest the motion from Vandenburg's attorneys deals with allegations of misconduct against the prosecutors, whom Vandenburg's attorneys say destroyed or lost evidence. Davidson County District Attorney General Torry Johnson responded with a statement, saying: ""The fact is, our office has given defense counsel for all four defendants complete access to the investigative file as the materials have become available."" He did not specifically deny whether there was an interview missing. Among the things Vandenburg's attorneys says he never got missing are text-message records and call logs of Franklin, the alleged victim and other football staff members. The motion also alleges that Franklin met with the woman in the hospital and told her he cared about her because she had assisted him with recruiting. It goes on to request interviews, police records, medical records and communication records. Vandenburg is accused of taking an unconscious Vanderbilt woman into a building on campus on June 23. He allegedly was joined in his dorm room by three other now-former Vanderbilt football players also indicted on charges of rape: Cory Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie, authorities said. All four were dismissed from the team following the allegation. They all have pleaded not guilty. Penn State, when Franklin was hired, said the university thoroughly vetted Franklin and dismissed criticism that he wasn't a good choice in the wake of the Sandusky scandal that ended the career of legendary coach Joe Paterno and the indictment of the Penn State's former president, athletic director, and vice president for finance. But claims of a thorough vetting wasn't enough to appease some critics. One of them was Jennifer Storm, a victims advocate in Pennsylvania, who said Wednesday that she believes Penn State could not have known all the details in a fluid investigation like the one at Vanderbilt. ""It doesn't make any rational sense for an institution coming off such a horrific scandal to then hire someone in the midst of a scandal himself,"" Storm said. In 2004, after reports of women being assaulted at all-female recruiting parties, the NCAA banned such gatherings, although news reports in the last 10 years painted a picture of them continuing to happen at schools.","Four former Vanderbilt football players face rape charges .

"(CNN) -- As America grapples with a crisis of children on its southern border, another image from another time seems inescapable: that ship full of Jewish refugees off our shores as World War II approached. You might have seen the story portrayed in the Holocaust Museum in Washington. It unfolded in 1939 as Jewish families fleeing from Germany took passage to Cuba on a German liner, the St. Louis. While underway, Cuba decided to deny them entry so they turned toward America, desperately hoping the United States would show them compassion. But the U.S. political climate had turned hostile toward the growing number of European Jewish immigrants. On June 6, 1939, their ship hovered off the coast of Miami Beach -- only to learn that the U.S. government refused them entry. Losing hope, the St. Louis turned back to Europe and there, in the months and years that followed, over a third of its passengers perished at Nazi hands. America has had many noble moments, but that was a moment of shame that left an indelible stain. Seventy-five years later, we are faced with a new group of desperate people hovering in our midst -- this time children from Central America escaping escalating levels of violence few of us can fathom. While certainly no Nazi Germany, the growing humanitarian crisis in their home countries is glaring as rising murder rates for youths are a driving force behind the mass exodus. How will we respond this time? A family secret that changed his life . As has been widely reported, the number of unaccompanied children arriving from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras has increased tenfold since 2011. It's no surprise that the current system -- designed for no more than 8,000 children -- has collapsed under the stress of 40,000 unaccompanied minors since in October. By year's end, our government says, as many as 90,000 may be apprehended -- a tripling of last year's border arrest figures. But just as with the Jewish refugees on the St. Louis, this influx is not primarily a story of immigrants traveling to America to seek opportunity and prosperity. This is a story of three countries so plagued by gang violence, chaos and poverty that a family would rather pay a ""coyote"" 18 months of income to take their 14-year-old daughter on a life-threatening 45-day, 2,000-mile journey than have her risk her life at home. This is a story of three countries with levels of violence comparable to a war zone. Honduras suffers from the highest murder rate in the world, and El Salvador and Guatemala are in the top five. In fact, a civilian is twice as likely to be killed in these three countries as in Iraq during the height of the war. It is also the story of three broken states where the police are infiltrated by street gangs (some copied on U.S. models) and governments -- corrupt from top to bottom -- are helpless in their fight against organized crime. And it's the kids who are most at risk in this story. Boys are recruited into gangs sometimes before they hit their teenage years. Girls are forced into nonconsensual relationships with gang members where they are raped, abused and sometimes ""disposed"" of afterward. And any defiance invites violent retaliation and, often, death. One immigration rights advocate recalls a mother telling her, ""I would rather see my child die on the way to the United States than die on my doorstep."" Another organization reports a child explaining, ""If you stay, you will die, if you leave, you might. ... Either way it's better to try."" What should be done? We can solve the immediate crisis of children piling up in detention centers. Congress can -- and should -- pass some version of the president's $3.7 billion emergency spending request. We can -- and should -- beef up security at the border, hire more judges to expedite the process,and track down the children who skip their court dates. We can -- and should -- provide due process to these kids, seeing who legally qualifies for staying here as refugees from persecution. Estimates vary on how many will qualify. But those calling for mass deportations of the rest need to think long and hard about what sort of fate we are sending these kids back to. Unless circumstances change, many forced to return to their cities will likely perish. They are now in our care. Are we not morally obligated to prevent the possible deaths and abuses of thousands of these children? So how do we humanely protect these kids without encouraging new waves of children to undertake highly dangerous journeys and wind up on our already overstressed border? Surely, we as Americans are capable of coming up with creative solutions that are compassionate as well as sensible, solutions that tell the world (and ourselves) that we still aspire to be good-hearted, noble but pragmatic people. Three steps come quickly to mind. We invite you to post others. --First, we should respond generously to those children who have already arrived or will soon. For those who qualify for refugee status under U.S. law, we should ask families across our country to help provide new homes for them. -- Second, we should push to establish ""safe zones"" -- operated by the United Nations, supported by the U.S. -- for returning children and their families in their native countries and work with those countries to reduce their violence and expand hope. Opinion: Border crisis could last a long time . --Third, once the ""safe zones"" are developed, we should set a firm date when all children who arrive thereafter will be returned to their native countries regardless. The idea of ""safe zones"" is not new. The United Nations has successfully established such protected areas in two major instances: to protect refugees in the Indochinese crisis of the 1970s and to shield 2 million Kurds from slaughter by Saddam Hussein's troops after the 1991 Gulf War. As we learned from a ""safe area"" that did not work in Bosnia in 1995, it is essential that there be enough well-armed international and regional troops on the ground to ensure zones are not overrun. In Bosnia, thousands lost their lives. Understandably, many Americans are fatigued from trying to help other nations when our own communities are desperate for more help. Polls show that our citizenry, frustrated and disgusted by years of wars that are ending badly, are more opposed to the U.S. taking on new tasks overseas than at any time in the past 50 years. And it's true: the only way this crisis ends well in the long run is if these Central America governments successfully fight back against gang violence and corruption. We will definitely need to aid them in their efforts, as we did in Colombia where our financial support has helped to stem the tide. Even so, moments inevitably come that define who we are as a people. As the saying goes, we may not be looking for trouble but trouble is looking for us. How we respond to these thousands upon thousands of desperate, destitute children is one of those moments. Will we turn our backs, as we did so shamefully to those Jewish refugees years ago? Or will we live by our ideals? That is the choice we now face.","Gergen, Katz: U.S. turned away ship of German Jewish refugees fleeing Nazis .

"(CNN)It's proving to be a roller-coaster ride for Ghana at this year's Africa Cup of Nations. After the heartache of conceding a last-minute winner against Senegal in its opener, ecstasy has followed with the Black Stars stealing all three points at the death in their second Group C match against tournament favorite Algeria. Following 91 minutes of a game of football that had very little to show for it, Asamoah Gyan -- back for Ghana after a bout of malaria -- was on hand to keep his nation's dream of a first Africa Cup of Nations title in 33 years alive. Despite a poor showing, but for a handful of minutes at this tournament, Avram Grant's men will take heart from beating the competition's highest-ranked team -- the last time it defeated Algeria in the Africa Cup of Nations, it went on to win the whole thing in 1982. The result means Ghana is now level on points with Algeria but leapfrogs the North African nation into Group C's second qualifying spot due to its superior head-to-head record. The day's late game between South Africa and Senegal ended 1-1, leaving Group C very tight -- South Africa sit top, one point ahead of Ghana and Algeria, with bottom-placed South Africa a further two points adrift. Ghana's chances of a victory against Algeria did not look quite so bright at halftime, however, following a cagey, scrappy 45 minutes bereft of any real quality, with the Black Stars desperate not to lose and the Desert Foxes happy with a draw. Given that it was pretty much a must-not-lose affair for Ghana in Mongomo, Equatorial Guinea, jangling nerves were perhaps to be expected. And they certainly had their wicked way in the first half, with a poor touch from Brimah Razak in Ghana's goal almost handing Yacine Brahimi the opener on a plate, only for the keeper to recover in time. Algeria, equally, struggled to make an impact, lacking the enthusiasm going forward it showed in last summer's World Cup, though it did come closest to scoring in a drab first half through Nabil Bentaleb, who fired wide an Aissa Mandi delivery. Ghana appeared a somewhat different team after the break, perhaps realizing that three points might be vital towards ensuring a first Africa Cup of Nations group-stage exit since 2006 is avoided. Gyan first went close, heading an Harrison Afful cross agonizingly wide, while Andre Ayew and Jordan Ayew also had chances -- the older sibling heading over after his younger brother had earlier fired a flicked effort off target. Inspired by its opponent, Algeria also picked up its performance going forward, resulting in a rather more open second 45 minutes. One constant from the first half, however, remained -- a lack of quality in the final third. That was until a shattered Gyan latched onto a long ball forward over the top deep into stoppage time and picked out the bottom corner. ""Asamoah is a great player with a fantastic attitude. He was ill but he played the 90 minutes and scored at the end,"" Grant told FIFA's official website following his first competitive win as Ghana coach. ""He is a great player but also a great personality. But it's not just the victory of one player. It's the victory of a whole team."" The second match at Estadio de Mongomo saw South Africa and Senegal play out a far more entertaining affair, with the second half coming alive after an uninspiring opening 45 minutes. Although eventually succumbing to a 3-1 defeat against Algeria Monday, it was South Africa that started the brighter and took the lead on that occasion -- and it was similar for the Bafana Bafana this time around. The 1996 champion was the more threatening team in the first half and came out of the blocks firing after the restart as Oupa Manyisa converted a cross from the right into the bottom corner of the net with an excellent first-time finish. Senegal, insipid in attack up to that point, was soon awoken and thought it had found an equalizer through Sadio Mane shortly after, only for the goal to be disallowed due to offside. Minutes later, though, and the Lions of Teranga had leveled, with Kara Mbodj rising highest to head home Pape Diop's free-kick past the stranded Jackson Mabokgwane. With momentum on its side, it was Senegal who looked the more likely to score another, attempting to replicate Monday's comeback victory over Ghana. This time, however, there was to be no last-minute winner for Alain Giresse's side, yet it still had the consolation of ending the evening sitting atop Group C.","Ghana beats Algeria 1-0 with last-minute winner from Asamoah Gyan .

"The latest report from House Republicans on IRS targeting of conservative groups - their sixth - says the tax collection agency ""systematically targeted"" conservative groups over the course of two years and ties the behavior to a ""culture of bias"" among IRS employees. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrel Issa slams IRS officials in the report for their ""inability to keep politics out of objective decisions"" and points to a ""general loathing"" toward conservative organizations. The report -- Issa's last before he hands his gavel over to Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz  -- also explicitly spreads the blame beyond Lois Lerner to seven other top IRS officials, singling out two former IRS commissioners, the agency's chief counsel and several others. But Issa has yet to find a smoking gun linking the IRS's inappropriate screenings to political direction from the White House. That effort will continue under Chaffetz. ""The fact-finding is not yet complete,"" according to the the report. The IRS still has yet to comply with three subpoenas requesting more documents and records and under Chaffetz's leadership, the Committee is expected to look into another 30,000 newly recovered emails to and from Lois Lerner, the now-former IRS official who has been at the center of the probe. The Senate Finance Committee, which will be chaired by Republican Sen Orrin Hatch in January, is also conducting an investigation. Related: White House says Lerner emails lost in computer crash . Democrats dismissed the new report as not telling the entire story. ""It is revealing that the Republicans -- yet again -- are leaking cherry-picked excerpts of documents to support their preconceived political narrative without allowing Committee Members to even see their conclusions or vote on them first,"" said Rep. Elijah Cummings in a statement. ""By leaking information to reporters on condition that they not disclose it to Democrats, Republicans are intentionally bypassing the normal congressional vetting process designed to distinguish fact from fiction."" The report released Tuesday ties the targeting of conservative groups caused by a ""perfect storm of mismanagement"" that extended from the bottom rungs of the IRS to ""the very top"" of the organization with ""bad judgment, inexperience, and bureaucratic rigidity"" at fault. But most of all, the report charges that IRS staffers inserted their own political beliefs into their jobs, allowing their liberal bias to influence professional decisions on whether groups should obtain tax-exempt status. ""Conservative organizations were not just singled out because of their political beliefs—they were targeted by IRS officials and employees who expressed a general loathing toward them even while begrudgingly admitting that those organizations were in compliance with...the tax code,"" the report reads. The report also reveals emails between IRS officials, noting an email from one IRS agent to another about an application from a group that had donated to a political group. After a first agent wrote that he was ""not sure we can deny them"" simply for donating to another non-profit social welfare group, another agent replied: . ""This sounds like a bad org...This org gives me an icky feeling."" Reports emerged last year that liberal groups were also singled out by the IRS for closer scrutiny, but the Committee asserted in its Tuesday report that the special attention to liberal groups was for ""non-political reasons"" and that all seven applications that were flagged for containing the words ""progress"" or ""progressive"" were ultimately approved. Among the senior officials blamed for the targeting or their failure to stop the selective screening of political groups, the committee calls out Doug Shulman, who led the IRS as its commissioner over the course of the alleged targeting. The Committee asserts that Shulman was aware of the targeting and failed to do act to stop it. ""Shulman failed to fully inform Congress about the IRS's inappropriate treatment of conservative-oriented tax-exempt applications, despite his awareness of inappropriate treatment,"" the committee report states. And his deputy and later successor as acting commissioner, Steve Miller, also ""failed to prevent targeting"" and did not ""promptly inform Congress of the misconduct,"" according to the committee. Both of their chiefs of staff are also singled out. The report also slams Holly Paz, the director of the IRS's Rulings and Agreements section, for allowing IRS agents to use ""inappropriate screening criteria."" Paz was placed on administrative leave in June 2013. The report also suggests that Chief Counsel William Wilkins made a ""deliberate attempt to obfuscate his role"" in the scandal, saying he could not recall over 80 times in response to the Committee's questions.","The final report by a Congressional committee accuses the IRS of having a ""culture of bias"" against conservatives .

"Mauritius (CNN) -- For an island country that spans less than 800 square miles, and hosts a little over one million inhabitants, Mauritius is surprisingly multicultural. Though 80% of the populace are descendants from the country's early settlers, they are made of a mix of Indian, African, French and Chinese heritage. The nation's diversity makes for a rich, cultural smorgasbord whose presence is felt in the local food, music and architecture. History . Part of the tiny country's worldliness is due to the fact that it was occupied by an array of nations. The Dutch took control in 1638, only to be followed by the French and ultimately the British before the island's independence in 1968. Under the Dutch and the French, slaves brought over from other African nations drove a large part of the economy. Many of the island's remote regions -- particularly Le Morne Mountain -- became refuges for escaped slaves. ""During the French period, 5% of slaves left their property and went to settle in natural places in a quest for independence -- 10% during the British period,"" says Breejan Burran, a local historian. ""[On Le Morne Mountain], they lived in such an isolated place that they were not even aware when slavery had been abolished. When people were coming around, [many former slaves] thought they were slave hunters and they just threw themselves down the mountain and killed themselves in this way,"" he adds. Though slavery on the island was abolished in 1835, the British introduced indentured laborers from India onto the island to work in the sugar industry. Around 450,000 were brought to live on the island. Many of their descendants still live there today, lending Asian influences to the African nation. Food . Nothing illustrates the melting-pot nature of Mauritius quite as succinctly as the cuisine. At the bustling Central Market in the capital Port Louis, thousands of people come daily to search out a global array of produce, from cassava to soy sauce, and dahl to roti. ""You can get all things here. There's a Chinese section, you can get Creole fruits and vegetables over there. We use some roots, some local things, European things and we mix it and create one plate here,"" says Vijay Purlackee, a chef at one of the island's five-star hotels. Music . It should probably come as no surprise that the local music also incorporates a range of styles. Sega -- the traditional music of the island -- has recently given way to a whole new style that borrows heavily from reggae. The result? Seggae. ""We started to think, 'how are we going to start a new style of music to express the real problems of Mauritius?' So we started to set about a fusion with reggae music, because in this time reggae was started to be listened to in Mauritius,"" explains Ras Natty Baby, a local musician who has championed the new style. ""This music has become like a liberation, you know? Music has no border, even when the authorities want to border in the music, it's like the wind, it's like water. You can't block music; there's a lot of ways to express music,"" he says.","Mauritius hosts a population of about 1m people, but is surprisingly multicultural .

"TRENTON, New Jersey (CNN) -- The man who raped and killed 7-year-old Megan Kanka -- the 1994 crime that inspired ""Megan's Law"" -- is one of eight men whose sentences were commuted to life in prison this week as part of New Jersey's new ban on execution. Megan Kanka's killer, Jesse Timmendequas, is among eight men whose sentences were commuted to life. The Garden State on Monday became the first state in more than three decades to abolish the death penalty after a commission ruled the punishment is ""inconsistent with evolving standards of decency."" Gov. Jon Corzine the day before commuted the sentences of eight men sitting on the state's death row. They will now serve life in prison without parole, according to the governor's office. Among the eight is Jesse Timmendequas, 46, who was sentenced to death in June 1997 for Megan's murder. Prosecutors said Timmendequas lured Megan to his home by saying he wanted to show her a puppy. He then raped her, beat her and strangled her with a belt. A day later, he led police to her body. ""Megan's Law,"" introduced after her death, requires that authorities notify neighbors when a sex offender moves into an area. Timmendequas had twice been convicted of sex crimes -- on 5- and 7-year-olds -- before he murdered Megan. In signing Monday's bill, Corzine called it a ""momentous day"" and made New Jersey the first state to ban capital punishment since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated it in 1976. ""It's a day of progress for the state of New Jersey and for the millions of people across our nation and around the globe who reject the death penalty as a moral or practical response to the grievous, even heinous, crime of murder,"" Corzine said. Society is not forgiving criminals, the Democratic governor insisted, but the law is necessary because ""government cannot provide a fool-proof death penalty that precludes the possibility of executing the innocent.""  Watch Corzine sign the document » . ""Society must ask,"" he continued, ""is it not morally superior to imprison 100 people for life than it is to execute all 100 when it's probable we execute an innocent?"" The state Assembly approved the measure Thursday by a 44-36 vote after the Senate OK'd it 21-16. New Jersey has not executed a prisoner since 1963. The new legislation replaces the death penalty with life in prison without parole. The bill was introduced in November after a state commission concluded capital punishment was an ineffective deterrent to crime. Since the Supreme Court's reinstatement of the death penalty, almost 1,100 people have been executed in 37 states.  See the death penalty by state » . According to the Death Penalty Information Center, which opposes capital punishment, New Jersey joins 13 states and the District of Columbia that do not use execution as a means of punishment.

"ISIS has used videos of its shocking beheadings of Western hostages to seize the world's attention, threatening the United States and its allies. But the Islamic militant group is also pushing its extremist views in a slick online magazine. The publication -- named ""Dabiq"" after a town in northern Syria that symbolizes a clash between Islam and the West -- portrays U.S. President Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain as ""crusaders"" who will ""bring about the complete collapse of the modern American empire."" It also carries images evoking apocalyptic battles between the Sunni extremist group's fighters and the rest of the world -- including American soldiers enveloped in flames. By producing the magazine, ISIS is taking a leaf out of the book of its former ally al Qaeda, which has praised and advocated terrorist attacks in its glossy publication, Inspire. But experts say the two terrorist groups don't appear to be aiming for the same goals through their propaganda. Inspire focuses more on practical advice for terrorists planning attacks, publishing guides on how to make bombs and get them onto planes. Dabiq ""is very different,"" Seth Jones, a security analyst at the RAND Corporation, told CNN. ""This is encouraging people to come, to recruit and to join the army in Iraq and Syria -- and fight."" 'A global outreach strategy' ISIS has already been exploiting the brutal tactics it used to grab control of large areas of Syria and Iraq for publicity purposes. The publication of Dabiq demonstrates that ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, is ""looking not only to nearby areas for support, but is undertaking a global outreach strategy to recruit immigrants to build its state,"" the Institute for the Study of War said in a recent report. It noted ""the sophistication and production value of the magazine."" ISIS has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe, including from the United States and Western Europe. A CIA source told CNN last week that more than 15,000 foreign fighters, including 2,000 Westerners, have gone to the civil war in Syria. It was not immediately clear how many have joined ISIS and how many are with other groups opposed to the Syrian government. The foreign fighters come from more than 80 countries, the CIA source said. Article on Foley's beheading . Dabiq carries plenty of violent images, apparently aimed at luring jihadists. It has photos of the mutilated bodies of Muslims wounded and killed by Western forces and their allies -- but also pictures of ISIS's own victims. The final section of its most recent issue is dedicated to the beheading of American journalist James Foley, the first of three Western captives whose killings the group has publicized. The article defends his murder as retribution for Western military campaigns in the Middle East. The magazine shows that ISIS, which is also known as ISIL, is paying close attention to what's being said about it in the West, featuring an ""In the Words of the Enemy"" section. In the first issue, it focuses on an article co-written by Douglas Ollivant, an Iraq combat veteran and key adviser on the surge in U.S. troops there under former President George W. Bush in 2007. Ollivant, who appears regularly on CNN, is also described as a ""crusader."" He said he was ""perversely honored"" that the terrorists were reading his work, but was also aware he was being ""incorporated into their propaganda."" ""We take them seriously, write about them seriously, and perversely they then twist this to their potential recruits and say 'Look, you know, American analysts take us seriously,'"" Ollivant told CNN.

"Mass shootings have been occurring more frequently in recent years, an FBI study shows, with nearly one incident a month from 2000 to 2013. The study, which was released Wednesday, reported 160 incidents during that time, with 486 people killed and 557 wounded. Those figures don't include the deaths or injuries of the shooters. The bureau called such shootings ""active shooter incidents"" -- which the report described as ""individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in populated areas (excluding shootings related to gang or drug violence)."" Underscoring the difficulty authorities have to prevent such incidents or reduce their lethality, the study found that 60% of the shootings ended before law enforcement officials arrived. In cases where investigators could determine the length of time of the incident, most of the shootings lasted under five minutes and many under two minutes. In 40% of the cases studied, the shooters killed themselves. Most of the shootings were carried out by males.  Only six of the ""active shooters"" in incidents during that time period were female. Seventy percent of the incidents ""occurred in either a commerce/business or educational environment,"" the FBI said. James Yacone, the FBI's assistant director overseeing the Critical Incident Response Group, said at a briefing that the study is part of a White House-directed response to some of the recent mass shooting incidents and the need to understand what's behind them and how to prevent them. Because police and other first-responders often also are shot or wounded, the FBI hopes to implement better practices for local agencies usually first on the scene. ""In essence, we're trying to improve our readiness,"" Yacone said. Frequency increasing . And if you think such shootings seem to be happening more frequently in the past few years, you're right. ""In the first half of the years studied, the average annual number of incidents was 6.4, but that average rose in the second half of the study to 16.4, an average of more than one incident per month,"" the study said. ""Recognizing the increased active shooter threat and the swiftness with which active shooter incidents unfold, these study results support the importance of training and exercises -- not only for law enforcement but also for citizens."" The FBI said the goal of the study is to ""provide federal, state, and local law enforcement with accurate data so they can better understand how to prevent, prepare for, respond to, and recover from these incidents."" Active shooter incidents differ from ""a defined crime, such as a murder or mass killing,"" the study says, because ""the active aspect inherently implies that both law enforcement personnel and citizens have the potential to affect the outcome of the event based upon their responses."" 25 deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history . Andre Simons leads the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit 2 in Quantico, Virginia, which is helping to study the motives for shootings and assists local police in detecting early signs that may indicate a suspect is planning one. Simons said at Wednesday's briefing that while the motives vary widely, more shooters appear to be inspired by past mass shootings. ""The copycat phenomenon is real,"" Simons said. Anecdotal evidence shows that ""many active shooters have a real or perceived deeply held personal grievance and the only remedy that they can perceive for that grievance is an act of catastrophic violence against a person or an institution,"" Simons said. Many shooters research major shooting events and find inspiration from the notoriety that killers receive. ""As more and more notable and tragic events occur, we think we're seeing more compromised and marginal individuals who are seeking inspiration from these past attacks,"" Simons said. Case studies . Among the incidents studied by the FBI for the report was the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012.  Gunman Adam Lanza, 20, killed 20 children, ages 6 and 7, and six adults at the school  before killing himself.  Police later found the body of Lanza's mother at her home. ""In at least nine incidents, the shooter first shot and killed a family member(s) in a residence before moving to a more public location to continue shooting,"" the FBI report said. Another case studied for the report was the mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater in 2012. Twelve people were killed and 58 wounded. Accused gunman James Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the killings; his trial begins next month. In 2007, Virginia Tech student Seung-Hui Cho shot and killed 32 people and wounded dozens more in a classroom building and a dorm on campus before killing himself. Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 people and wounded 32 at Fort Hood, Texas, during a shooting rampage November 5, 2009. He was convicted and sentenced to death.","Between 2000-2013, there were 160 ""active shooter"" incidents, FBI study shows .

"Maine police revealed Saturday that blood was found in missing toddler Ayla Reynolds' basement and, for the first time, cast doubt on the accounts of adults who were in the home when she was last seen -- saying they don't ""pass the 'straight-face' test in Maine."" ""We feel they know more than they're telling us,"" said Stephen McCausland, a spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety. Investigators found the blood during their initial search of the Waterville, Maine, house, though they did not specify how much blood there was and where exactly in the basement it was located. Determining whose blood it is is ""a top priority of the crime lab,"" McCausland said. Justin DiPietro -- the father of Ayla, who was 20 months old when authorities began looking for her last month -- sleeps in the basement of the home, which is owned by his mother. McCausland said authorities felt they should reveal the information about the blood discovery now, because ""we need information from the public, and we think this might help."" ""The public needs to understand we're frustrated, and no closer to finding Ayla than we were ... December 17,"" he said. Police have said that DiPietro's mother, Phoebe DiPietro, wasn't home the night of December 16, when her son told police that he put his daughter to sleep in her first-floor bedroom at 8 p.m. He called police the next morning just before 9 a.m. to report her missing. Justin DiPietro has said in a written statement that ""he would never do anything to harm my daughter."" Police now say that Ayla was alone in the bedroom the night before she was reported missing, even though relatives have told CNN her younger cousin normally slept in the same room. In addition to Ayla and her father, two other adults and two other children were in the house on the night of December 16, according to authorities. They were Justin DiPietro's girlfriend and her young son, plus Ayla's aunt and her toddler. The latter two also live in the house. The two other children are thought to have slept in a different bedroom than Ayla, and police believe Ayla's aunt was with them, according to McCausland. Police said the adults told them ""someone snuck into the house, went into the bedroom where Ayla was sleeping, and no one heard or saw anything."" Yet ""there is no evidence that we have found that would point to an abduction,"" said the state spokesman. ""Their story ... doesn't pass the 'straight-face' test in Maine,"" McCausland said. See more coverage from CNN affiliate WCSH . ""We don't know what happened other than we know Ayla didn't walk out on her own, and we have grave doubts she was abducted because there were three adults in the home that night (and) it's a very small house."" No one has been arrested in the case, and police have not identified Justin DiPietro or anyone else as a suspect. ""We're not ruling anyone in or anyone out,"" McCausland said. Police confirm that Justin DiPietro took a polygraph test, but won't reveal the results. Lie detector evidence is not admissible in court. He told Waterville's Morning Sentinel newspaper that police wouldn't show him the actual polygraph paperwork to show him how he did. ""I know I went in there and smoked it,"" Justin DiPietro said. ""I told the truth, and that's it."" Phoebe DiPietro has told CNN she fully supports her son and doesn't believe anyone who was in the house on that December night would harm the toddler or had anything to do with her disappearance. She has said she just wants Ayla back healthy and safe. ""I'd give everything I owned if we can have her back,"" Phoebe DiPietro said. On Saturday, Justin DiPietro and Ayla's mother, Trista Reynolds, appeared together publicly for the first time since their daughter's disappearance to thank those who have tried to help locate Ayla, CNN affiliate WCSH reported. The two embraced when DiPietro showed up 30 minutes before the event ended and later talked calmly on the steps of Waterville City Hall, according to WCSH. Trista Reynolds had told HLN's Nancy Grace last month that she raised Ayla for 18 months, and that DiPietro had become involved after she ""needed to go and get a little bit of help for myself."" She told HLN she entered rehab. DiPietro had sole custody of Ayla when she disappeared. Two days before Ayla was reported missing, Reynolds filed court documents seeking custody of the girl. The 23-year-old mother said she didn't tell DiPietro she was going to court because he was ""vindictive"" and ""verbally abusive."" Reynolds said Saturday that ""I don't have the answers that you guys are looking for."" She reacted emotionally, when asked about the police announcement that blood was found in Ayla's house. ""I'm ready to go knocking at people's door myself because I want to know what happened to my daughter, and I want to know where she is and who took her or just whatever, like everybody else does,"" she said.","Ayla Reynolds' parents appear together at an event to thank searchers .

"The similarities are striking. An American journalist kneels in the desert, dressed in an orange prison-style jumpsuit. A masked ""executioner"" lords over him, wielding a knife. The journalist speaks; the executioner speaks. And then the horrific happens: the victim is beheaded. ""It is almost the exact same choreography,"" said Peter Neumann, a professor at King's College London, comparing ISIS videos showing the deaths of American journalists Steven Sotloff and James Foley. The executioner appears to be the same person. The location of the two killings also appears to be similar. Neumann suspects they took place in or around the Syrian city of Raqqa, one of the safest areas for ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. ""It's titled 'A Second Message to America,' and it basically contains exactly the same message,"" Neumann said about the Sotloff video, which was posted Tuesday. A video of Foley's execution was released last month. The executioner . Sotloff's apparent executioner speaks in what sounds like the same British accent as the man who purportedly killed Foley. He's dressed identically in both videos, head to toe in black, with a face mask and combat boots. He appears to be of similar build and height. He waves a knife in his left hand, as did the militant in the video of Foley's death. And then, there are his actual words. ""I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State,"" the executioner says in the second video. ""Just as your missiles continue to strike our people, our knife will continue to strike the necks of your people."" Obama on ISIS in Syria: 'We don't have a strategy yet' At the end, the video threatens the life of a British captive, just as the Foley video threatened Sotloff's life. The SITE Intelligence group says there's no question the same masked fighter appears in both videos. Adds CNN's Karl Penhaul, ""He certainly wants us to think that he is the very same man."" Following Foley's death, the British ambassador to the United States said that experts in his country were close to identifying his killer. He has not yet been named. Questions . The U.S. intelligence community is busy analyzing the Sotloff video to try to answer some key questions: When it was shot? Where was it shot? Is the killer the same as the one in the Foley video? The administration does not want to speculate on specifics of the video until those questions can answered, a senior official told reporters. Paul Ginsberg, a forensic audio and video expert, said analysts will comb through every inch of the video, ""analyzing the electronic impulses, the audio, the video, the speech, voice identification, the geography -- for whatever information it can provide -- as well as the production techniques."" U.S. analysts have said it's not possible to know from the first video who beheaded Foley because the entire slaying is not shown. A man moves a knife across Foley's neck, then the picture fades to black. Kerry: 'The cancer of ISIS will not be allowed to spread' One forensics expert has raised the issue that there appear to be two militants in the video. The second militant appears on the video after an obvious edit. ""There's definitely a change of actor,"" said Ross Patel, the forensics expert. ""There are noticeable -- there are subtle -- but there are also noticeable changes in their build, their physical appearance."" The man who speaks, holds a knife in one of his hands. It looks to be a different knife than the one that was left next to Foley's body. Also, the dimensions and style of the knives are slightly different, Patel said. In the Sotloff video, the picture fades to black immediately before and after the start of the beheading so, again, it's not immediately clear whether the man speaking is the same man who then killed the journalist. Who is ISIS?","The U.S. intelligence community is analyzing the latest video .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard and Environmental Protection Agency on Saturday authorized BP to use chemical dispersants underwater to help break up the oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico. BP and other authorities have already used more than 436,000 gallons of dispersants on the ocean's surface, but the Coast Guard says using it underwater could be even more effective. CNN takes a look at what dispersants are, how they work and what other effects they may have on humans and the environment. What are dispersants? Dispersants are a common product used to clean and control oil spills in the ocean. They are special fluid chemicals that bond to the oil molecules and separate them from water molecules, thus breaking up the oil. The result is tiny oil droplets that can biodegrade more quickly than a mass of oil. Though they are chemicals, they are generally less harmful than the highly toxic oil, the Coast Guard and EPA say. How are dispersants used? Dispersants are usually used on the surface of the ocean and distributed by aircraft flying over an oil spill. BP said this week it has made more than 120 such flights to spread dispersant in the Gulf of Mexico. Using it underwater is a new idea, and BP says it hopes to inject the dispersants directly into the oil flow at a point close to the main leak on the seabed. The technique could help break up and disperse the oil before it reaches the surface, BP says. Are dispersants harmful to the environment? Experts say dispersants, while toxic, are much less toxic than oil. Using them on an oil spill produces the ""lesser of two difficult environmental outcomes,"" says EPA administrator Lisa Jackson. But some experts, including Ken Rosenberg of Cornell University's Lab of Ornithology, say dispersants still pose a problem for the environment. ""Almost certainly it's going to have major effects down in the water to the marine life and, ultimately, this is the same marine life on which the birds and animals on the surface are dependent,"" Rosenberg told CNN. Scientists have warned that fish eggs and larvae, shrimp, coral and oysters are potentially most at risk from dispersants. The chemicals can also contaminate the skin of ocean-farmed fish if their cages are near where dispersants are used, according to the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation, a nonprofit group that offers technical guidance on cleaning up spills. Do dispersants pose any harm to humans? The dispersant being used by BP is made by the Nalco Holding Co. based in Naperville, Illinois. The company would not discuss the exact chemical makeup of the dispersant, Corexit 9500, in part because the formula is a trade secret. Corexit 9500 comes with a warning that it can cause irritation to the eyes, skin and respiratory tract with prolonged contact. Toxicologists and environmental scientists say, however, that dispersants are unlikely to cause immediate harm to people. Charlie Henry, scientific support coordinator with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has said the dispersants being used in the Gulf show ""fairly low toxicity."" CNN's Caleb Hellerman contributed to this report.","Dispersants are a common product used to clean and control oil spills in the ocean .

"(CNN) -- A few years ago a group of us were having dinner at a steakhouse, and among the people at the table were the terrific sports columnist Mike Downey and his wife, Gail Martin. The manager of the place came over to say hello; introductions were made. At one point in the evening I was making my way to the men's room and ran into the manager again. I said to him, ""That Gail Martin you met? I think you're probably familiar with her late father."" ""Who was her dad?"" the man said. ""His first name was Dean,"" I said. Within minutes the taped music that had been playing in the restaurant stopped, and a new tape was substituted -- a Dean Martin tape. Any steakhouse worthy of the name has his music on hand. There it was, coming out of the ceiling: ""You're nobody till somebody loves you. ..."" And just the sound of it -- just that instantly recognizable deep tremolo of Martin's voice, so warm and easy and seemingly effortless -- had an effect on the room. It was as if someone had sprayed some kind of invisible muscle relaxant into the air. People visibly loosened up, they smiled a little more, it was like a friend had arrived and had said: Quit worrying about things. Life doesn't have to be so serious. He's been gone for more than 16 years now -- he died on Christmas Day, 1995 -- yet he seems to get only bigger as the years go by. I've been noticing it in recent days: That voice keeps drifting out of radios, out of television sets, out of hidden speakers in malls and coffee shops and clothing stores ... it's as if his voice, and his face, have by some sort of silent national acclamation been voted the quasi-official antidote for tense times. In a lousy mood? That changes as soon as you hear: ""When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie. ..."" The coolness of Dean Martin seamlessly crosses generations; young guys heading for a weekend in Las Vegas with their buddies understand his appeal just as viscerally as their grandparents do. He never, in life, actively campaigned for this role -- the eternal model of coolness -- and in death it has just seemed to be bestowed upon him naturally. His friend Frank Sinatra may have liked the image of being Chairman of the Board, but the core of Martin's enduring allure is that not only did he not want to be chairman, he didn't even want to serve on the board: It would mean that he would be cooped up in some boardroom for meetings when he'd rather be out playing golf. The sight of him in a tuxedo -- he wore it as comfortably as most men wear a pair of pajamas -- says to people who weren't even born when he was at the height of his fame: Take a deep breath and let yourself grin. Your problems can wait until tomorrow. He didn't like to rehearse, his friends said, because he knew he would do just fine without it. As he grew older he didn't feel the need to endlessly seek out applause, because he had been so famous for so long -- his nightclub and motion picture partnership with Jerry Lewis, his own movie career, the Rat Pack years, his success as the host of his television shows, his sold-out concerts -- that he'd heard enough ovations to last a lifetime. His ease onstage made his audiences feel at ease, too; he seemed as at home in front of a packed Vegas concert crowd as he was in the den of his own house (his line at catching his first glimpse of an audience: ""How did all these people get in my room?""). It had been a while since I'd talked with Gail Martin, but I called her the other evening, and she told me that, like the rest of us, she is forever encountering her dad's voice unexpectedly in public places: ""It's always reassuring, it's always nice. I was in a store one holiday season, and there was a Christmas tape playing. A choir of some sort was singing a Christmas carol, and that ended and then there was my dad: 'Oh, the weather outside is frightful...' I just smiled a quiet smile. He's always there."" She said the reason he appeared so relaxed while working was because it wasn't an act. ""Nothing seemed to bother him. And if something ever did, he sure wasn't going to bother anyone else with it."" She said that when she was a girl and was in a bad mood at home, her dad, in that voice of voices, would say to her, without a bit of rancor: ""Go up to your room if you're going to pout. Come on back down when you're happier."" In Florida the other night I was walking along the street and thought I heard him singing. It was a restaurant with an outdoor terrace; a local duo -- they billed themselves as Frank and Dean â€” was performing in front of one of those digital music machines that can replicate the sound of a full orchestra. The shorter of the two was singing Sinatra songs, the taller was doing Dean Martin. The physical resemblance wasn't really there, but the songs were right. Whenever it became the Dean imitator's turn for a tune, he would jack the vibrato in his vocals into overdrive: ""Everybody loves somebody sometime ... "" And the thing is, the people at the cafe were gravitating toward him. They were on their feet, beaming, moving closer to the microphone, some of them dancing, some just blissfully staring, seduced by the sound. The singer looked as if he was accustomed to getting this reaction. It turns out that it's cool to be Dean Martin even when you're not really Dean Martin. Ain't that a kick in the head? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says the coolness of Dean Martin seamlessly crosses generations .

"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio emerged from the depths of the nation's largest transit system Thursday to assure commuters that trains are safe in the wake of reports of an ISIS terrorist plot against U.S. subways. ""I have a simple message for all New Yorkers: There is no immediate credible threat to our subway system,"" de Blasio told reporters after taking a short subway ride from City Hall to Union Square in Manhattan. ""I say that with confidence. People should go about their business as they normally would."" Intelligence and law enforcement agencies have no indications of an ISIS terror plot against U.S. transit systems, two U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN earlier. Later on Thursday, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Iran and Iraq Brett McGurk told CNN's Brianna Keilar that there ""is no specific credible threat whatsoever that they have uncovered to the United States."" He spoke to Keilar having just come from a meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and Vice President Joe Biden. From Washington to New York, a flurry of denials followed media reports that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told reporters at the United Nations that his country's intelligence agency had uncovered an imminent ISIS plot against United States and Paris subways. ""We don't have anything to back it up at this point,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf told CNN. ""We'll keep looking at it."" A senior administration official told CNN that ""no one in the U.S. government is aware of such a plot and it was not raised with us in our meetings with Iraqi officials"" at the United Nations, including a meeting between al-Abadi, President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. FBI Director James Comey told reporters that he hadn't heard of the plot. U.S. agencies are reaching out to Iraq to determine what information it may have, the two officials told CNN. ""We know that our transit and aviation systems are always a target. We know New York is always a target,"" one U.S. law enforcement official told CNN. ""Do we know what the Iraqi Prime Minister is talking about? No,"" the official said. Why is ISIS taunting the West? 'We are monitoring these reports' De Blasio stood with Police Commissioner William Bratton and FBI Assistant Director in Charge George Venizelos outside the Union Square subway hub for a news conference. ""We are convinced that New Yorkers are safe,"" he said. ""We are convinced that people should go about their normal routine. Terrorists want us to live in fear."" As a precaution, the mayor said, New York will increase security measures throughout its vast transit network. ""You may be asked to open your bag,"" he said. ""You may find there are some spot checkpoints set up. Don't be alarmed."" Bratton said New York was already on a high state of alert because of the world leaders in town for the U.N. General Assembly, including President Barack Obama. In Connecticut, Governor Dannel Malloy ordered increased state police presence along Metro North and Amtrak rail lines, as well as at Bradley Airport. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said state officials were treating the report with ""utmost precaution"" and ""coordinating at a high level with local, state and federal partners."" ""I want to assure the people of New York that we are monitoring these reports closely and are in close communication with officials in Washington,"" Cuomo said in a statement. He said that New York and New Jersey authorities had in recent weeks increased security at mass transit sites and areas as part of a joint security enhancement. John Miller, the New York Police Department's deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, said in the statement that police were in ""close contact"" with the FBI and other federal agencies. ""New York City normally operates at a heightened level of security and we adjust that posture daily based on our evaluation of information as we receive it,"" he said. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the city's buses and trains, declined to comment. A spokesman for Transport Workers Union Local 100, which represents subway workers, said the MTA, as of Thursday afternoon, had not issued any security bulletins. Everything you need to know about the rise of ISIS . Earlier plots . European and New York transit systems have been targeted in the past. On March 11, 2004, terrorists in Madrid, Spain, carried out coordinated bomb explosions on four rush-hour trains, killing 191 people and wounding more than 1,800. The Madrid train bombings were the deadliest terror attack in Western Europe since the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, which killed 270 people. The terrorists in Madrid, the authorities later determined, carried bombs in sports bags and backpacks onto four commuter trains serving the east of the Spanish capital. They got off and left behind their deadly devices. Spanish courts later convicted 14 Islamist militants for their roles in the bombings, along with four Spaniards for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks. On July 7, 2005, 52 people were killed and 700 injured when four bombers planted explosives on three underground trains and a bus in London. The bombers, from the north of England, used cheap explosives and techniques found on the Internet to carry out the country's worst terror attack. British intelligence came under criticism after reports that the country had received reliable warnings about such an attack. Two weeks after the London transit bombings, an attempted second wave of bombings struck other trains and a bus, but the devices failed to explode properly. More than a dozen people were arrested afterward. Four homemade bombs stuffed into backpacks did not fully explode in the attempt. One person was injured. In 2012, a Bosnian immigrant accused of plotting to bomb New York's subway system as an ""al Qaeda terrorist"" was found guilty of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit murder, supporting a foreign terrorist organization and other charges. Prosecutors said Adis Medunjanin traveled to Pakistan's tribal region with two high school friends, Pakistani-born Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay, an immigrant from Afghanistan. His friends pleaded guilty to planning the attack with with Medunjanin and testified against him. Medunjanin sought to join the Taliban, but ended up being recruited by al Qaeda to perform a suicide mission in the United States. On their return, Medunjanin and his two friends hatched a plan to rig backpacks with explosives and blow them up, prosecutors said. At trial, Assistant U.S. Attorney Berit Berger said Medunjanin was willing ""to strap a suicide bomb to himself, walk into a New York City subway and blow it up.""","State Dept. official tells CNN ""no specific credible threat whatsoever"" uncovered in U.S.

"Another week in America, another mass shooting. This time the mayhem was at the hands of a drive-by shooter Friday night, firing at people in Santa Barbara, California. Six dead, 13 others injured, gunman suicide, police say. Officials called the man ""severely mentally disturbed."" The rampage comes only weeks after police headed off a Minnesota teen's plans to shoot up his school. According to news reports, John David LaDue allegedly possessed an arsenal (which included homemade bombs) that he allegedly planned to use to slaughter as many students as he could at his high school in rural Minnesota. Thanks to a civilian tip and good police work, we narrowly escaped a mass shooting then. On Friday, we were not as lucky. A friend of mine predicted that the United States would suffer probably 10 such shootings in 2014. I didn't want to believe him, but I knew it would be true. It turns out we will suffer far more than 10. We've seen a shooting where an assailant targets multiple people somewhere in this country every week this year, according to the website Shootingtracker.com. Only a small number -- such as the recent FedEx shooting in Georgia, or those at Fort Hood, Texas, or Jewish facilities in Kansas -- will gain national attention. We have a problem with gun violence in this country. I think this much is not in dispute. The real debate is this: What do we do about it? Unfortunately, most answers to this question involve greater governmental regulation and intrusion into our lives. Americans are fiercely independent, sometimes to a fault, and we bristle at any effort seen as trampling our inalienable rights. But the freedoms guaranteed in our Constitution have never been unfettered. Each amendment in the Bill of Rights has spawned a legacy of case law that interprets, defines, refines and restricts our basic freedoms based on the values and needs of the people at the time. Here are some examples: . The First Amendment -- our freedom of speech, of expression, of assembly -- is our most fundamental right, but even it is not unrestricted. No matter how strongly we feel, our words cannot be used to incite violence. They cannot be used to further terrorism. We cannot incite panic (shouting ""fire"" in a crowded theater). We are allowed our freedom of religion, yet we cannot force those religious beliefs on others. The Fourth Amendment says we are secure in our home, and that the government cannot search and seize our effects and paper without probable cause. While we're free from improper government intrusion, the interpretation of probable cause has loosened over time. We're free from government intrusion as long as we are not doing something illegal or something that would negatively affect our community. (I can live at peace in my home; I cannot do so with a meth lab.) And of course we have amendments that ended slavery and granted universal suffrage. The Constitution is not written in stone. It evolves as our society evolves. The Second Amendment is more complicated, however, because it deals with issues larger than freedom and oppression; it deals with life and death. Buried in the Second Amendment is the right to self-defense, the very mechanism that allowed our Founding Fathers to win freedom from tyranny. Some argue it is the right that guarantees all other rights. Our forefathers wanted us to be able to protect ourselves against outside threats, and even from internal tyranny. They may have even intended us to be able to protect ourselves from each other. It is a stretch to argue they intended guns to be so available, in such strength, that children, high-school populations and co-workers and law enforcement could be so easily slaughtered. A gun in the hands of a law-abiding citizen is the perfect, unassailable instrument for self-defense and for the protection of one's family. To tell someone who is acting reasonably and rationally that they have to give up that right is unfathomable to the responsible gun owner. That's why gun rights advocates have such a negative response to any perceived restrictions on gun ownership: They know, without question, that they will only use their weapon properly. But all too often guns are used improperly, without justification, with tragic results. While we have laws preventing convicted felons from legally owning guns, we live in a reality where even properly maintained guns wind up in the wrong hands, where the overly free commerce of firearms virtually assures that some of them will be used by people with criminal intentions. Gun rights advocates often see a comment like that as an argument for further restriction on their use of weapons, but that's not the way I intend it. I myself am a responsible gun owner. I believe in the right to justified self-defense. I also believe that reasonable restrictions to assure that only law-abiding citizens can purchase firearms better prevents over-restriction of our Second Amendment. Our Constitution is a resilient force, and our Bill of Rights has survived countless modifications and restrictions without the erosion of fundamental freedoms. Our Second Amendment right is no different: It can survive modification and restriction without the fear that it will vanish altogether. Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently pledged $50 million to address gun issues. In the face of such a concerted effort, the failure of gun rights advocates to allow any reasonable flexibility to our right to bear arms could mean that it will eventually buckle under the weight of thoughtful opposition propelled to action by the next series of tragic and, unfortunately, inevitable mass shootings.","Mark O'Mara: Fatal shooting rampage in Santa Barbara latest to reflect U.S. violence problem .

"(CNN)Mandatory evacuations were in effect overnight for those in danger because of a Northern California wildfire, which has already destroyed five homes and is threatening 1,000 more, a state fire spokesman said. The Applegate Fire -- centered in Placer County, about 40 miles northeast up Interstate 80 from Sacramento -- had burned 420 acres and was 20% contained as of late Thursday afternoon, according to Cal Fire's website. It is not expected to abate much until at least Friday. ""We do not have containment on the lines that could affect structures, and we have downed power lines,"" Cal Fire spokeswoman Joann Cartoscelli said, explaining why the evacuations will continue through the night. ""We don't want to put firefighters or the public at risk."" Five homes in the small community of Applegate have been destroyed, and many more are at risk. That's why evacuation orders have gone out to those living on dozens of roads in the area, and three evacuation shelters -- two in Auburn and one in Colfax -- have been set for those with nowhere else to go. Cartoscelli said the threatened residences are ""primary residences, not vacation homes."" The blaze has also affected I-80, which had one lane open eastbound in the hardest hit area as of late Thursday afternoon. Pilot dies in air tanker crash while fighting fire at Yosemite . According to Cal Fire, more than 1,200 personnel are devoted to fighting the blaze. They have a lot of tools at their disposal, including 128 fire engines, 18 dozers and seven helicopters. Those in the affected area should see sunny skies, a high temperature of 79 degrees and likely shifting winds of 5 to 7 mph, according to the National Weather Service. Placer County is also in the middle of a major drought, which often means more dry, incendiary material to fuel a wildfire.

"Miami (CNN) -- An eagle ray weighing as much as 300 pounds landed on top of a woman on a boat in the Florida Keys last week, throwing her to the deck and pinning her underneath it -- the ""scariest thing"" that's ever happened to her, she said. The woman, Jenny Hausch, was on the chartered boat Friday with her husband and three children, taking pictures of a group of eagle rays as they flew out of the water. ""These eagle rays, they were flying through the air,"" said Kelly Klein of Two Chicks Charters, the captain of the boat. ""These giant things go out of the water and slam back down."" Hausch said she was in the front of the boat, snapping away. ""The first picture I took of the ray jumping was 50 feet in front of us,"" she said. When the ray jumped again, Hausch said she was readying her camera. ""Next thing I know, it hit me square in the chest. I fell backwards and fell down,"" she said. Klein said the ray kept ""slamming and slamming on top of (Hausch), trying to swim away."" Hausch said the incident happened so fast that she didn't have time to react. ""I was just trying to push it off me as I was scooting backwards,"" she said. Hausch's husband and children watched in horror. Florida Fish and Wildlife Officers Aja Vickers and Bret Swensson were patrolling the water near the tour boat when they heard screams. ""We turned around and looked and saw the eagle ray thrashing around in the boat and at that point we realized we had a problem,"" said Vickers. As the officers made their way to the boat, Vickers said, ""shoes were getting thrown off the boat, towels were going everywhere."" By the time officers made it to the boat Hausch had freed herself from under the ray. Klein said the animal measured 8-feet across, and probably weighed a good 300 pounds. ""It's just massive, it has a 10-foot tail,"" she added. Klein said everyone thought that Hausch was dead, but when she was freed she didn't have a scratch on her. Hausch said it was the scariest thing that's ever happened to her, and she's thankful she didn't get hurt. Hausch's children were hysterical, but she and her husband decided to continue the charter in hopes that the incident wouldn't make them afraid of the water. Eagle rays can measure as much as 10 feet across and 17 feet long -- from their snout to the end of their barbed tails -- and weigh up to 500 pounds, according to the Florida Museum of Natural History. The spines on the tails are venomous and can inflict serious wounds. In 2008, a woman died from the impact when a ray jumped out of the water and hit her as she boated in the Keys, but Vickers said both incidents were freak accidents. ""This is a total one-in-a-million chance,"" she said. ""These animals aren't attacking by any means. One theory is these animals jump during mating season.""","NEW: It's the scariest thing that's ever happened to her, the woman says .

"(CNN)F-16 fighter jets escorted two passenger planes into Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Saturday after a bomb threat made on Twitter was deemed credible, according to military officials. Southwest Airlines Flight 2492 and Delta Flight 1156 landed safely at the airport and were searched by bomb disposal units, according to airline officials. Nothing out of the ordinary was found, officials said. One runway was closed temporarily, causing delays for other flights as passengers on the two flights were questioned and their luggage was searched by bomb-sniffing dogs, officials said. Delta spokesman Morgan Durant said, ""It was a Portland, Oregon, to Atlanta, Georgia, flight. Delta is supporting the sweeping process carried out by authorities."" The Southwest flight was coming from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The F-16 fighter jets were from McEntire Joint National Guard Base in South Carolina and returned to the base after the passenger planes landed. ""What you see is a very hefty response,"" said CNN Aviation Correspondent Rene Marsh. Due to the current  world wide terror threats ""no one wants to take the risk,"" she said. Normal operations returned to Atlanta's airport after nothing suspicious was discovered during the searches.","Both flights landed safely, nothing out of the ordinary was found on the planes .

"""Thanks for the nomination Luke,"" jokes a young man in a YouTube clip pouring what he says is a new, unopened bottle of Sambuca spirits into a pint glass along with another, unidentified drink. As the liquids mix, he observes: ""And that is congealing nicely ... whew ... okay,"" before knocking back the potion. After a brief pause he declares: ""I nominate [he names some friends]. You've got 24 hours lads. Get it done."" The game, known as Neknominate, is thought to have originated in Australia and is now sweeping the world. It involves you filming yourself downing a drink -- often alcoholic and of large quantities -- and then nominating a friend to outdo you. All this is posted on social media -- be it Facebook or YouTube. But what started for some as fun has turned deadly; at least five men aged under 30 have died after drinking deadly cocktails. Now health professionals are warning young people of the risks of consuming large amounts of alcohol in a short time. ""This is a lethal game,"" Dr. Sarah Jarvis, medical adviser for the UK-based charity Drinkaware, told CNN. ""The point about alcohol is that it affects your ability to recognize that you're in danger, and it absolutely affects your ability to react to danger. So we have a double whammy."" There appears to be no limit to the type of drinks that are consumed, and in what matter. Each nomination becomes more and more daring and outlandish. It started as exhibitionism with this woman stripping in the supermarket and downing a drink, but the bravado has escalated into extreme cocktails: One mixes spirits with a dead mouse, in another a man drinks out of a toilet, and the craze has seen players consume alcohol with goldfish, insects, engine oil and dog food. Unsurprisingly the trend has prompted politicians to demand that schools play a bigger role. ""The Facebook drinking game Neknomination has gone viral, and very sadly young people have died as a result,"" said UK opposition spokesman Diana Johnson. ""What role do schools have in building resilience in our young people to resist peer pressure?"" The role of social media giants like Facebook is also coming under scrutiny. Brian Viner, whose own son has played the game, demanded that those companies face up to their responsibilities. His son was nominated and pressured to play the game but drank water instead of vodka so as not to harm himself. ""I was cross with him but more cross with the social media involved and the way this game has just spread,"" Viner said. ""The whole thing is madness and it needs some kind of sharp and swift action on the part of these social networks to stop it."" Facebook said in a statement: ""We do not tolerate content which is directly harmful, for example bullying, but behavior which some people may find offensive or controversial is not always necessarily against our rules. ""We encourage people to report things to us which they feel breaks our rules so we can review and take action on a case by case basis."" But Dr. Jarvis rejected this defense, saying Facebook must recognize its own role in the game. ""It's very difficult in this day of personal liberties to say that Facebook shouldn't be condoning this or taking these videos offline. ""Personally, I would like to see that happening. Frankly, if the thrill wasn't there, your mates weren't seeing you, I expect it would very rapidly fizzle out.""","Neknominate game, thought to have originated in Australia, now sweeping the world .

"New York (CNN)Around 100 potential jurors made their way into a Manhattan courtroom Monday morning, as Pedro Hernandez, alleged killer of 6-year-old Etan Patz, looked on. Hernandez, joined by his attorneys, Harvey Fishbein and Alice Fontier, sat in court opposite prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office as jury selection for the criminal case began. In May 2012, Hernandez confessed to choking the boy to death in New York City in 1979, according to police. The potential jurors were asked to review a list of 131 names of potential witnesses and disclose whether they knew anyone on the list. ""The publicity surrounding this case is ... unprecedented,"" said presiding Judge Maxwell Wiley, urging the possible jurors not to read any media reports on the case. You must ""base your decision on what you hear in this courtroom and nothing else,"" Wiley instructed. Jury selection is expected to continue at least until the end of the week, with an additional 100 people expected to arrive Tuesday.  Ultimately, 12 people will be chosen to serve on the jury. The trial is expected to last approximately two to three months, Wiley said. Hernandez admitted to luring Etan, who was en route to a school bus stop, into the basement of a bodega where Hernandez worked as a stock clerk and killing him, according to police. The boy's body was put in a garbage bag and thrown away, Hernandez allegedly told authorities. The remains were never found. Fishbein previously argued that his client falsely confessed and the statements were not reliable because Hernandez has an ""IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range,"" and had been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia. But a judge ruled in November that Hernandez's confession would be admissible in court. The Patz case garnered national attention after the boy went missing, and his picture was plastered on thousands of milk cartons around the country. In November 2012, a grand jury indicted Hernandez on second-degree murder and kidnapping charges. He pleaded not guilty in court the following month.","Pedro Hernandez is accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz in 1979 .

"President Barack Obama took more thinly-veiled shots at governors like New Jersey's Chris Christie on Wednesday, saying the mandatory quarantine policies some states have imposed amount to ""hiding under the covers"" from Ebola. After visiting a group of health care workers who'd recently returned from the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa -- some still within the virus's 21-day incubation period, but showing no symptoms -- Obama said policies like states requiring three-week quarantines of doctors and nurses who treated Ebola patients could harm U.S. efforts to stop its spread. He didn't mention Christie, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo or others by name, but said he's ""putting those on notice who think that we should hide from these problems."" ""When I hear people talking about American leadership and then promoting policies that would avoid leadership and have us running the opposite direction and hiding under the covers, it makes me a little frustrated,"" Obama said.

They come days after Christie and Cuomo, faced with the first potential Ebola cases in their states, said they were imposing mandatory quarantines for health workers who'd treated infected patients upon their return to the United States. California Gov. Jerry Brown's top health official announced a similar rule there on Wednesday, though the state hasn't yet had an Ebola case.

"New York (CNN) -- As a reproductive rights advocate and a proud mother of two, my blood ran cold as I read about Oklahoma's new abortion legislation (HB 2656). The state of Oklahoma just decided, and by an appallingly high margin I might add, that a doctor is protected from being sued if he or she chooses not to tell a woman that the baby she is carrying has a birth defect. State legislators made this decision Tuesday, voting 36-12 in the Senate and 84-12 in the House to override Gov. Brad Henry's veto of this law. (The Legislature also overrode the governor's veto of a second egregious law, HB 2780, which forces women to view an ultrasound before having an abortion.) Oklahoma, what have you done? Under this new law, a doctor may withhold information, mislead or even blatantly lie to a pregnant woman and her partner about the health of their baby if the doctor so much as thinks that fetal test results would cause a woman to consider abortion. As expected, the anti-abortion movement is claiming victory. But this bill isn't ""anti-abortion."" It is devastating because it is anti-motherhood and anti-medicine. When I found out I was pregnant with each of my children, like every woman who has ever undergone fetal testing, I held my breath at each doctor's appointment. I didn't let it go until the doctor or the tech said, ""Everything looks great."" I seized up when they took out the blood work results and I didn't relax until I heard, ""It all came back negative."" But a woman in Oklahoma no longer gets to exhale. Because now, when a doctor says, ""Everything looks fine,"" she has to wonder; does it really? Oklahoma politicians have now said that she can no longer count on the sacred trust that always existed between her and her doctor. A doctor may now lie to her face and, in doing so, deny a woman what is quite possibly the most important piece of information she will ever receive in her life. The very thought makes my breath catch even now. The information you get on those visits matters to every woman getting prenatal care, regardless of what she decides to do based upon the results. The legislators have decided that a woman, when she becomes pregnant, loses the right to full, honest information from her doctor. It is her right to know this information. It is how she and her family determine what to do next, not only to decide if they want to continue a pregnancy, but also to consider how they will prepare to care for a special needs child. What specialist will they turn to? What support will they require? Who will hold their hand in the delivery room if a child is born who will only live an hour, or a day? Does she want to call her own mom in from across the country or does she want to grieve silently with her partner? What will they tell the children they already have? Doesn't every family have the right to the information that may help them decide the course of their future or the future of their child? According to the Oklahoma State Legislature, they no longer do. These politicians have decided they know best what women need. They are wrong. I ask each politician in Oklahoma who voted yes on this bill: How dare you? How dare you deny a woman the peace of mind that her baby is healthy? How dare you not give her and her family time to prepare if, God forbid, her baby is not? How is this bill ""pro-life""? How is this mockery of medical care and paternalistic devaluing of women, ""pro-life""? This bill is anti-mom, it's anti-doctor and it is anti-family. And all women, regardless of how they feel about abortion, should be appalled. I hope the courts stand up for the women and families whom politicians have turned their backs on and find this law unconstitutional and flat-out wrong. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mary Alice Carr.","Mary Alice Carr says new Oklahoma abortion law protects doctors who lie from lawsuits .

"Angry Netflix mobs aren't putting away the pitchforks yet. The company said Monday that it would kill its spinoff, Qwikster, only a month after it was announced. That did little to placate consumers who are still fuming about price increases the company announced in July and who are starting to see Netflix as a once-innovative service that's lost its way. ""Netflix does more flip-flopping than a fish on a hot dock,"" a Twitter user named Steve Harrison wrote. ""Netflix's approval rating is so low right now it could run for president,"" @jokesbyCandice said. ""I don't think this fixes anything,"" said Ann Marie Blodgett, a 37-year-old in Utah. ""This will make people realize how right they were to leave them. Now they're just back-pedaling."" ""I don't feel the need to go back when they've already made too many changes too fast,"" said Adam Britten, a 21-year-old in London. The company's public relations nightmare began in July, when Netflix announced that it would stop offering free streaming video services to households that paid for its DVD-by-mail service. That raised monthly prices by 60% for some customers, without any improvement in the service. Then Netflix said in September that it was splitting its DVD and streaming services into two companies: Qwikster and Netflix. That incensed some already-angry customers, since they now would have to deal with two corporations instead of one. And, finally, on Monday the company pulled a 180-degree-turn. ""It is clear that for many of our members two websites would make things more difficult, so we are going to keep Netflix as one place to go for streaming and DVDs,"" CEO Reed Hastings said in a blog post. ""This means no change: one website, one account, one password ... in other words, no Qwikster."" Actually, that puts Netflix back at square two -- before the Qwikster fiasco, but with price hikes. Since all of the whiplash changes started, Netflix has lost an estimated 1 million customers -- possibly more. An earnings call on October 24 is expected to reveal details about how Monday's changes affected the company's customer base. It's clear investors don't like all this back-and-forth. The company's stock closed down nearly 5% by the end of Monday. Since mid-July, it's fallen about 60%. Not all consumer reaction to Netflix's decision to kill Qwikster was negative, however. Kyle Wegner, a 26-year-old in Fayetteville, Arkansas, said he was going to quit the service until he heard about Monday's announcement. ""It's the right move, not only because of the silly name of Qwikster, but it was just going to be such a huge pain to manage two separate companies that were doing the same thing,"" he said. ""Nobody wants to have to manage two different queues and pay two different bills for something that we're doing all together now."" The company does seem to have lost its way, he said. ""They're being really reactionary at this point, and that's not very comforting."" Others cut the company a bit more slack. ""As long as Netflix continues to function for a reasonable price I don't have reason 2 abandon it,"" a Twitter user named @Nitesh_Arora wrote. ""Wish they'd focus though.""","Netflix customers not happy about whiplash decisions .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of his decision to devalue Venezuela's currency, President Hugo Chavez on Sunday said he would put the military on the streets to ensure that business owners don't raise prices. Speaking on his weekly television program, ""Alo Presidente,"" Chavez railed against merchants who re-price their items in reaction to Friday's announcement that the Venezuelan bolivar currency, which had been fixed at 2.15 to the U.S. dollar since 2005, was devalued to 4.3 to the dollar. For food and medicine, Chavez announced a second fixed exchange rate for these ""necessity"" goods at 2.6 bolivares to the dollar. ""I want the national guard in the streets, with the people, to fight speculation,"" Chavez said, calling re-pricing a form of robbery. A devaluation makes foreign products relatively more expensive for domestic consumers, discouraging imports. Chavez showed a photograph in a newspaper of consumers in long lines over the weekend to buy goods, fearing that the sharp devaluation could result in higher prices. The president blamed such lines on ""teleterror,"" saying that opposition media outlets were fueling a panic. ""At this moment, there is absolutely no reason for anyone to raise the prices of anything,"" Chavez said. He encouraged people to publicly denounce businesses where prices increase and threatened to expropriate businesses that do. The government would transfer ownership of such businesses to the workers, Chavez said.","Venezuela President Hugo Chavez announces devaluation of country's currency .

"Fresh off his Senate floor speech against arming Syrian rebels, Sen. Rand Paul shifted gears Thursday night to lambast the current state of police militarization in the United States, especially when it comes to the war on drugs. The Kentucky Republican told a libertarian-leaning audience in Alexandria, Virginia that police sometimes direct their focus on the wrong crimes. ""You want your police to be aggressive,"" he said. ""But if someone's got some pot, you want to break down the door at two in the morning with masks and gas and concussion grenades?"" Paul was speaking to the Liberty Political Action Conference, where moments before his speech he was on stage with his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, to deliver a scholarship award. It was a rare dual appearance by the two, as Rand Paul, who's laying the groundwork for a potential presidential bid, has attempted to differentiate himself from his father's legacy as a vocal libertarian. (Rand Paul, however, dutifully quoted his father at the end of his speech: ""Freedom is popular. Bring it on."") On militarization, Rand Paul said the public may never really know what happened to Michael Brown, the unarmed 18-year-old shot dead by police in Ferguson, Missouri last month, and he didn't weigh in on the still unfolding controversy. But he's had much to say about the clashes between police and protesters that followed after the shooting. Paul made headlines last month with a commentary that called for the demilitarization of police. It was a bold stance at a time when many federal lawmakers were largely staying out of the Ferguson debate. He fired up the audience Thursday night, ticking off examples of outsized arsenals in small communities, collections that he described as ""crazy stuff."" ""When you see something dumb like giving out 12,000 bayonets, just stop doing it,"" he said. President Obama has ordered a review the federal programs that enable state and local law enforcements to purchase military equipment. Some of that force, Paul said, has been used against marijuana users. Recalling stories of people being injured during drug raids, Paul said the situation has ""gotten out of control."" ""I'm ok with police using force,"" he said, saying if his wife were taken hostage, he'd want someone to save her. ""But if somebody's saying there's some kid who's got pot in the house, I think it's a little crazy to have this war on drugs gone so far."" Paul has actively sought to reduce mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, as well as restore voting rights for nonviolent felons who've completed their sentences. The senator hits the road this weekend, this time to California. He participates in a school choice roundtable discussion in San Pedro on Friday, then speaks at the California GOP convention on Saturday.","Rand Paul says police forces have become too militarized .

"A day late and a compromise short. House Republicans stayed in Washington longer than planned to try to change an emergency border bill so it can pass without any Democratic help. A split between tea party conservatives and more moderate Republicans over how to respond to the immigrant surge from Central America threatened to further delay the start of the five-week summer break for Congress. GOP leaders abruptly pulled the bill from the House floor on Thursday, to address concerns by some conservative factions. They came back Friday with a revised version that included more money for the National Guard. Among the changes: provisions making it easier to deport children back to Central America and scheduling a separate vote on a bill to deny President Barack Obama the authority to halt deportations of young immigrants -- the so-called ""Dreamers."" In one way, it worked: The updated version passed the House on Friday night, by a 223-189 resoundingly Republican vote. But that doesn't mean this legislation is going anywhere. Zero chance . That's because the measure has zero chance of getting through the Democratic-led Senate, meaning Congress will go on its August recess without sending legislation to President Barack Obama on what both parties call a humanitarian crisis. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid confirmed as much Friday, saying ""I don't think it's going to get done"" because he ""can't imagine"" the Senate approving the House version. Obama later said the failure of Congress to provide emergency funding in response to the immigrant influx means he must decide how to reallocate resources because ""we've run out of money"" to handle the surge. He blamed overall Washington dysfunction on the inability of  congressional Republicans to agree among themselves on what to do, telling reporters that GOP legislators ""are not able to act even on what they say their priorities are"" and are unable to compromise because of differences among themselves. Internal division . As an example, he cited the refusal by House Speaker John Boehner to hold a vote on a comprehensive Senate immigration reform measure passed last year with bipartisan support from backing from across society including the business community, labor unions and faith-based groups. ""The argument isn't between me and House Republicans,"" he said. ""It's between House Republicans and Senate Republicans. House Republicans and the business community. House Republicans and the evangelical community."" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel shot back that it was Obama's failed leadership that caused the current border crisis, saying the President has been ""completely AWOL."" For House Republicans, the optics of passing a plan before heading home became the top priority after Senate Democrats were unable to push through their own version, which died Thursday night on a procedural vote. Steel pushed that point, noting that ""Senate Democrats have left town without acting on"" Obama's request for emergency funds."" ""Right now, House Republicans are the only ones still working to address this crisis,"" he said. Such is the state of politics in Washington less than four months before congressional elections. The partisan climate is as fierce as ever with conservatives again rising up to challenge establishment priorities and assert their agenda. Immigrant influx . The influx of immigrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- many of them unaccompanied children -- into Texas has overwhelmed border facilities and services, inflaming an already volatile political issue. Obama had asked for $3.7 billion in emergency funds to strengthen border security and speed up the processing of new arrivals, while the Democratic plan scuttled in the Senate called for $2.7 billion. The GOP measure in the House slashed that to $659 million and included a change to a 2008 anti-trafficking law to make it easier to send home the child immigrants. Tea party Republicans, spurred on by conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, rejected the plan because it failed to limit Obama from acting on his own on immigration issues, such as halting deportations of some child immigrants who arrived years earlier. Unilateral steps . They also fear further further unilateral steps signaled by the White House that would allow more undocumented immigrants to work in the United States. Ted Cruz weighs in . The conservative backlash forced GOP leaders to cancel a scheduled vote on Thursday night, originally planned as the last session before the summer recess. Instead, the Republican caucus met Friday to revise their plan by adding $35 million to help Texas pay for National Guard troops deployed to the border and loosen regulations to ease the ability to send home newly arriving immigrants with no standing to remain in the country. Legislators said after the meeting the changes appeared to secure the necessary support to pass the bill, but some dissatisfaction remained over plans to hold separate votes on the funding measure and a Cruz-backed provision to halt Obama's unilateral steps on immigration. Obama, however, called the resulting GOP legislation ""the most extreme"" version so far and said Republicans knew it had no chance of becoming law because the Democratic-led Senate wouldn't pass it and he would veto it. Widening gap . The changes widened the gap between Republicans and Democrats, who oppose removing guaranteed immigration hearings for child immigrants from Central American now required under the 2008 law. Reid said the House ""appears to be heading from bad to worse"" in its effort to secure conservative votes. Thursday's developments were an embarrassing result for Boehner and his new leadership team put together after former Majority Leader Eric Cantor's primary defeat last month. The canceled vote and resulting confusion displayed the continuing deep divisions between conservative and more moderate House Republicans that has caused similar episodes in the past on other spending matters. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the administration already has shifted resources from the nation's interior to the border to try to speed up the processing of new arrivals. Obama also will do what he can to address overall immigration reform because House Republicans have refused to vote on a comprehensive measure passed last year by the Senate, Earnest said.

"When a man tells me to ""trust him,"" my typical reaction is to run. When he tells me this while trying to get me to jump off a Swiss mountain with only a paragliding sail to stop me from plummeting to earth, I should run even faster -- even if he does look like Keanu Reeves. Instead, I ignore my irrational fear of heights and rational fear of men using bad cliches, take a running leap then gasp as the sheer terror subsides and I find myself soaring into the Alpine air. Below me the Swiss countryside unfolds like a map, with stunning views of the peaks of Eiger, Monch and Jungfrau, and the waters of Brienz and Thun lakes. It turns out the worst part of my first-ever paragliding flight -- made in tandem with an instructor resembling the star of ""The Matrix"" -- was the apprehension beforehand. It took me a while to build up the courage to even sign up for the flight, after but several hours of watching other people effortlessly winging their way over the glaciers from Beatenberg to Interlaken, I decided to do it. Still nervous, I opted for the tamer version of the rides on offer. Versions aimed at thrill seekers involve extreme aerobatics or high altitude James Bond-style takeoffs at Schilthorn, the 2,970 meter (9,700 feet) peak where ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" was filmed. Stuffed penguin . There's even a ride that allows fliers to make a grand entrance at a mountaintop restaurant, but with my aeronautic jitters, I could see this ending in disaster. Once aloft and floating serenely, I apparently can do no wrong, according to my instructor. All I need to do is sit tight, he says, which is just as well considering I feel like a stuffed penguin thanks to the layers of padding I'm wearing. I get a chance to catch my breath and take in the staggeringly huge panoramic vista, which is great as long as I don't look down too often. During the flight, my instructor takes pictures with a wide angle camera attached to an extendable pole, all of which turn out the same thanks to the tortured smile plastered on my face. He explains that the trick to staying for long periods is to find rising air currents known as thermals and circle around in them to gain height. Early mornings, he says, are best as the weather is more predictable. After that little tutorial, he offers to show off some nifty tricks. We're in midair, dangling from a scrap of crescent-shaped nylon fabric. What could possibly go wrong? We do a quick, sharp dip to the left, followed by another to the right. Hit the ground running . Before my dislodged heart can creep back to its original lodgings, we do a 360-degree turn. The pirouette is fantastic except that even when we stop spinning, my world doesn't. This isn't an experience for the faint of heart or full of stomach, but we survive to glide peacefully over alpine pastures, tiny chocolate box houses, lakes and grazing sheep. To land, we have to stand up in the harness and be prepared to hit the ground running, a fact that gets me panicking all over again. ""You can do it,"" deadpans Keanu. The worst that can happen, he says, is I'll graze a knee or break a leg. We manage, though I spoil the effect somewhat by crumpling into a heap and doing an excellent imitation of a beached whale. This isn't enough to dampen my spirits though, especially since I'm now the proud owner of a certificate proving my pluck. The spectacular flight over Switzerland will always be a good reminder that one can overcome fear with willpower.

"During 15 years of talking to high school students about sex and bullying, Laurie Halse Anderson has continued to get the same questions from boys: Why was the main character in her book, ""Speak,"" so upset about what happened to her? Didn't she want the attention of one of the popular boys? And why was the impact so traumatic? Anderson, who published the award-winning novel in 1999, believes the questions come from an honest place. They're teen boys, after all, growing up in a society where media and pop culture tell them women are created for sexual gratification. They're not used to reading novels that feature characters like Melinda Sordino, a teen who is raped by a classmate at a house party. As her classmates and neighbors go to great lengths to protect her attacker, Melinda plunges into near-silence, refusing to say what happened while still feeling ostracized by her classmates. Fifteen years after its publication, society has shed some of the stigma associated with sexual violence, but the conflict at the heart of ""Speak"" still shows up in headlines, from Steubenville, Ohio, to Maryville, Missouri. And yet, many parents still struggle to find the words or the courage to talk to teens about sex and intimacy, Anderson said. As a mother who raised four girls, Anderson knows that parents today are navigating uncharted territory when it comes to adolescent sexuality, and they're doing it earlier than parents in other generations. Talking to teens about sexuality, intimacy and consent is urgent, she said. ""We've fallen down on our responsibility to our children by somehow creating this world where they're surrounded by images of sexuality; and yet, we as adults struggle to talk to kids honestly about sex, the rules of dignity and consent,"" she said. ""So many teens out there are operating in a vacuum, they're operating in adult situations without any adult support or advice."" For the 15th anniversary of ""Speak,"" Anderson is lending her support  to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, a resource for survivors of sexual violence. Macmillan, the publisher of ""Speak,"" is matching donations to the organization in April, which is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Anderson said she wrote ""Speak"" based on her own experience of being raped as a teen. She struggled for years to find the words or the courage to express what she'd gone through. Much has changed since then, she said, and ""Speak"" has become required reading in some schools across the country. Scores of students still describe the same struggles to Anderson, and she often directs them to the RAINN hot line, she said. Over the years, more resources have emerged for survivors of sexual violence, especially online. Today, if you're a victim of any crime, including sexual violence, you can go online and ""find someone who's walked in your shoes who can help you make sense of what happened,"" she said. ""I do see reduction of shame, which is very good. We still have a long way to go yet.That's the reason many victims don't come forward. That feeling is understandable, but it's why we still need to do more to reduce the stigma around rape,"" she said. While the Internet brings people together and creates supportive communities, it has also become the source of damaging images and intense bullying, she said. ""We as a culture are still figuring out how to teach our children the awesome parts of the Internet and cell phones and new media, but we also have to figure out how to keep them safe,"" she said. Although many students first encountered ""Speak"" in high schools, it's now being taught in middle schools, Anderson said. She thinks it's an acknowledgment that sex education needs to start earlier if we want to help teens feel comfortable talking openly about sex and what feels right and wrong. She believes parents can be more involved, too; just take a deep breath and commit to talking about sex and what constitutes consent, she said. ""Because boys and girls can be victims of rape, we need to try to teach them to make decisions about life that keep them safe, sober and with people they can trust, and make sure people who might be inclined to rape -- who think they can get away with it -- know they can't get away from it. ""It used to be that we teach girls not to be raped, but we need to start teaching boys not to be rapists, and that's a really hard thing for parents of boys to process,"" she said. ""No one wants to think of their sons as rapists. ""We are a culture who is right now in 2014 finally having the conversation that it actually doesn't matter what a woman is wearing, you're not supposed to rape her. I think we're all trying to find the right language surrounding sexual assault. I'm optimistic  that we're heading in a better direction as a culture."" The term ""young adult lit"" was hardly in use when Anderson wrote ""Speak."" She didn't set out to be a public touchstone in the genre, she said. A teacher who uses ""Speak"" in her classroom told Anderson that she calls it ""resilience literature,"" a term Anderson said she is proud of. ""Speak"" is about teen rape, the pressures of high school and the insularity of small-town life, but most importantly, it's about overcoming stigma, Anderson said. ""That can be the most painstaking aspect of being a teen, figuring out what the world really looks like,"" she said. ""If you find someone in a book, you know you're not alone and that's what's so comforting about books.""","Real talk about sex among families is more important than ever, ""Speak"" author says .

"(CNN)A late goal saved Ivory Coast's blushes as they secured a draw against Mali in the Africa Cup of Nations Saturday, keeping them on course for the a place in the quarter finals. Mali had taken an early lead after striker Bakary Sako, who plays for Wolverhampton Wanderers in the English Championship, superbly powered home a right foot volley from close range. The goal looked to have been enough for Mali, who defended stoutly against an Ivory Coast team featuring the likes of Manchester City's Yaya Toure and Wilfried Bony. Equalizer . But The Elephants pushed hard for an equalizer. Winger Max-Alain Gradel clinched it, scoring with seven minutes remaining. The Ivory Coast are now top of the group on two points with one game to play. Despite the late goal, Ivory Coast's French coach Herve Renard, a previous winner of the tournament as coach of Zambia, was not happy with some of the officiating, especially a first half penalty appeal for a foul on Wilfried Bony. Renard unhappy . ""I won't talk about anything but I was not upset against my players. I think you are able to understand against what I was upset, but now it is too late to talk about that,"" Renard cryptically told AFP. ""I don't like to create controversy after. All that leads to is being suspended. I need to remain calm,"" he added. ""There were lots more good things today than in the first match but unfortunately we went behind early on. Once again we struggled at the start of the game. I think if you look at the statistics, they didn't have many shots on goal."" All square . Group D's other two teams, Cameroon and Guinea, played out an entertaining 1-1 draw. Cameroon took the lead rather fortuitously when a Benjamin Moukandjo corner went straight in before a goal by the highly rate Ibrahima Traore before half time leveled the match. The group is now delicately poised going into the final round of games, with all four teams on two points after four consecutive 1-1 draws.","Ivory Coast score late equalizer against Mali .

"San Francisco, California (CNET)  -- On Wednesday, Sony unveiled Move, its motion-sensitive controller. A small device that looks like a microphone -- but with something on top of it that looks like a ping pong ball with an LED inside -- Move is Sony's bid to gain control over the motion controller wars that are currently led by Nintendo, with its Wii controller, and which many think will be dominated by Microsoft and its Project Natal controller system. To Sony, releasing the Move is an obvious move for the PlayStation, given it believes it started the motion controller era with its Eye Toy. Sony held its press conference during the Game Developers Conference here. Now, the Move, which will be available this fall in a starter kit that begins at under $100 for a Move, a PlayStation eye camera and a game, is its attempt to jump ahead of Microsoft's Natal and to begin winning over Wii users. ""We like to think that the migration path between Wii households and PlayStation households is a natural path,"" said Peter Dille, Sony's senior vice president for marketing and PlayStation. Shuehei Yoshida, Sony's president for worldwide studios, said Move will ""demonstrate that the motion controller for PS3 will be the solution for both casual and hard-core gamers alike"" and that the types of games Sony can create with it are ""amazingly diverse."" Among the types of games Move will work with include those that involve swords, bows and arrows, guns, punching and much more. The idea is that Move will provide players with a realistic and precise feeling of holding whatever kind of thing the game calls for, be it a sword or a gun. Sony first talked about its new motion controller at E3 last year but didn't have a name or any kind of timing. Now, by unveiling the device's name it can begin what Dille said will be the company's biggest video game marketing effort of the year. While Sony is expecting consumers to use Move with a range of brand-new games, the company also clearly thinks that it will enhance game play in existing titles. As such, it showed off how Move can be used to move characters around in its hit title, Little Big Planet. Further, the controller comes with its own accessory, known as a sub-controller, which will accentuate what's possible with Move. And later this year, the forthcoming game SOCOM 4 will incorporate both Move and the sub-controller. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- It's 25 years since the end of Communist rule in Romania, and although much may have changed in the East European nation, its production line of gymnasts continues to generate champions. From Nadia Comaneci, the sport's first ""perfect 10"" back in the 1970s, to multiple '80s gold medalist Ecaterina Szabo and the post-revolution exploits of Simona Amanar, the country's young women have set benchmarks of excellence. Standing less than five foot tall, but with deceptively long legs, the 18-year-old Larisa Iordache is the latest to be dubbed the ""New Nadia."" Having helped Romania to a team bronze at the London 2012 Olympics, she has blossomed this year -- claiming two golds at the European championships as the only gymnast to qualify for all four finals and finishing runner-up in the all-round competition at last week's worlds in China. ""I didn't choose gymnastics -- it chose me. It just happened. I am very glad to have got so far,"" she tells CNN's Human to Hero series. Iordache was spotted as a child playing in a park, chasing her brother on rollerblades. ""I think she noticed the speed and the energy and that impressed her,"" Iordache says of the woman who became her first coach, Mariana CÃ¢mpeanu-SiliÅŸteanu. Rollerblading was probably not the sort of pastime available to children during the reign of president Nicolae CeauÈ™escu, whose bloody overthrow in 1989 signaled the beginning of a new era. ""I was born after Communism, however my parents told me about how much stricter things were back then compared to now,"" Iordache says. ""Now it's a very open country and people survive by doing what they can -- it's much easier than before. I'm glad I didn't live through that."" Nonetheless, she learned the rewards of hard work when, aged five, she joined Bucharest's CS7 Dinamo Club -- an institution renowned for producing champions in a wide range of sports. And when she was selected to the junior squad at the age of 10, she realized how important gymnastics was to her. ""It was a new path that I had to try out and try to go all the way to the end, trusting myself as much as I could,"" she recalls. It didn't take long for her to appreciate the thrill of performing in front of a crowd. ""I loved being watched by people,"" she says. ""It's so important, when you've been working hard, to be able to show what you've worked for daily."" Iordache describes her sport as a ""beautiful story that encompasses in all domains an elegance and attention that you have to display when working on the apparatuses, the determination you need to show on each, the pleasure as well."" ""You can't succeed without pleasure and desire,"" she says.","Larisa Iordache is Romania's latest young gymnastics star .

"(CNN)Cricket is not a game that looks ready to take off among American sports fans -- but it could be about to provide an unexpected new career for professional athletes in the United States. Despite the millions earned in Major League Baseball, the minor leagues are filled with players only pocketing around $1,000 a month as they chase a dwindling dream of making it big. It's a breadline salary so low that it has sparked a class-act lawsuit against major teams. But one man thinks another way out is for minor leaguers to take their professional skills and switch them to another ball game. Julien Fountain, the former fielding coach for Pakistan's Test cricketers who also played baseball for Great Britain, is recruiting American players to a scheme he calls Switch Hit 20 -- aimed at taking the inherent aptitude and athleticism of ballplayers and training them in the nuances of Twenty20 cricket. ""I'm not trying to take players away from a baseball career,"" says Fountain, who had tryouts with the Royals, the White Sox and the Mets, before coaching some of cricket's top international teams using skills learned in the ballpark. ""But any current minor leaguers who feel they aren't going to make it, or guys who have recently been cut or quit because they simply cannot afford to carry on; they are perfect for a career in modern cricket. And the key things for these guys is that it pays considerably better than the Gulf Coast League."" It's something he's already done once. After leaving his post with Pakistan last year, he converted a group of Korean baseball players into a national cricket team that reached the quarterfinals of the Asian Games this fall. ""Having moved back and forth between the two sports myself, I know the potential these guys have for success in T20 cricket,"" says Fountain. ""I was the first to introduce baseball fielding techniques to international cricket, because a major league outfielder will out-throw a professional cricketer every time. This is a sport that Americans can do well at."" Minor leaguer Boomer Collins has been chasing the dream of the big leagues since he was a boy. His looks, his build, the way he talks and even his name are as near to the definition of an American ballplayer as you're going to get. But beyond the square jaw and the all-state honors as both outfielder and quarterback, there's one thing that makes him different to every other guy out there on the diamond. He wants to be the greatest cricket player the world has ever seen. Thomas Collins III got the nickname ""Boomer"" thanks to the tornado crashing past the Texas hospital where he was born in June 1989. A couple of decades later and his .374 batting average, with 13 home runs in 60 junior-year games at Dallas Baptist, saw him eventually signed by the Blue Jays. His story since then is depressingly similar to thousands like him, becalmed in the minor leagues on a poverty-line salary of $1,200 a month. ""I'm always an optimist. I'm 25 years old. This year will probably prove a lot. I want to make the big leagues and I'm going to work my butt off until it happens or doesn't happen,"" Collins said in his break between working an eight-hour milk delivery shift and a full afternoon of offseason training. Collins is one of the first signups to Switch Hit 20, and talks with surprising enthusiasm about a sport he has only seen on YouTube links sent to him by Fountain. Cricket's revolution 11 years ago into Twenty20 or T20 -- with games taking three hours instead of five days -- has seen sleepy spectators replaced with raucous crowds, batters swinging for the fences instead of blocking balls, cheerleaders on the sidelines, and the creation of new competitions. The annual Indian Premier League, for instance, awards the best players seven-figure contracts for a season lasting just eight weeks. Collins hopes it can save him from 3.45am wakeup calls and the end of his athletic career, but believes he has something to contribute as well. ""I've always wanted to do something to change the world -- something that I can put my stamp on,"" he says. ""Jackie Robinson did it for African-Americans in baseball. We can do it for Americans in cricket. ""The athleticism that Americans can bring to the table could revolutionize the game of cricket even more to become a bigger, faster, stronger sport. ""Look at soccer now. That all came from American players making a stand in what was a minority sport over here. ""If you would've said 'soccer' about five years ago people would've said, ""Get outta here, man"". Now everyone's watching the World Cup."" Another player hoping to break the mold is middle infielder Jordan Dean, a 24-year-old drafted by the Tigers in 2012 but now with Illinois independents the Schaumburg Boomers -- and studying for an M.B.A. as a Plan B. ""A lot of us guys in the minor leagues have to take the decision -- are my legs going to hold up, or my bank account, and which is going to go first?"" Dean says. ""In my case it'll be the bank account, because I know that otherwise I'll never be ready to finish playing ball. ""I've talked to my girlfriend about the cricket thing. We'd go through about five or 10 minutes thinking how amazing it would be, traveling the world playing sport. Then it would be, 'What the hell am I saying?' It's ping-pong in my brain."" For Fountain, the endgame goes beyond getting his players a T20 contract. ""I want to inject enough talent into USA cricket, to see it bounce back up the rankings. I want to coach a USA team at a World Cup."" A team already exists, but he believes replacing its largely ex-pat spine with American baseball talent is the only way it can join the elite. ""Wearing a jersey with the flag on the front and your name on the back is huge for any American,"" says Dean. But Fountain has also let his early sign ups know that there are a few things to iron out before he can start printing jerseys. ""I'm aiming for tryouts in the spring, so the guys who are already with teams, or trying out for teams can also come and try out for me,"" says Fountain. ""Sponsorship is crucial. We're in talks with some interested parties but even if companies like Greyhound can lay on some tickets to get these players to the tryout, that would help. ""I've wanted to do this for years -- I talked to some TV companies about a reality TV show back in 2010 and I hope it could still be a part of it."" Brenden Kalfus, 23, was another earning in the region of $14,000 a year with a Blue Jays affiliate before they let him go this past season. ""I think if we all started playing cricket, I don't think the expectation would be that we're going to be stars and make millions,"" he says. ""It would just be great to be the first to bring it out to America. Then see where it goes after that."" If the project stalls, Boomer Collins is prepared to go it alone. ""The whole thing with me is that whatever happens, I still want to go overseas and try because I have got that excitement so high,"" he says. ""I still want to go and train with Julien to try it out myself. If we can work out a living situation with food, I would do it in a heartbeat. I don't have to have some sort of income, just as long as me and my wife have food and a place to stay. ""I know that I'm not going to be the best in the world in the first five years of playing the sport. But I'm also never going to go in and say, 'I'll just be OK.' ""I'm going to go and try and be the best cricket player in the world."" Fountain says it will take less time than Collins thinks. ""These guys have the potential to take the world of T20 cricket by storm,"" he said. ""For the last few years you have heard cricket announcers use the phrase, 'That was a real baseball shot.' ""Well now you will be able to see those so-called baseball shots executed by guys who really can hit a ball 400 feet -- with a bat whose hitting area is a fraction of the width of a cricket bat.""","Low wages push players away from minor league baseball .

"(CNN) -- Police in New Jersey arrested a teenager in connection with a public-address-system announcement telling ""all blacks"" to leave a Wal-Mart store, a police spokesman said. The 16-year-old boy is from Atlantic County, New Jersey, said deputy police chief John Dalesandro of the Washington Township Police Department. The suspect was arrested Friday in Atlantic County on bias intimidation and harassment charges, police said in a statement Saturday. He is in custody of his parents, police said. Gloucester County prosecutors say that shortly before 5 p.m. on March 14, an unidentified male accessed the public address system at the Turnersville, New Jersey, Wal-Mart Supercenter Store. ""All blacks need to leave the store,"" the voice announced. Store management contacted the Washington Township Police Department, which opened an investigation in conjunction with the county prosecutor's office, Dalesandro said. Wal-Mart corporate spokesman Lorenzo Lopez said the company is ""just as appalled by this as anyone."" He emphasized that Wal-Mart, the world's largest public corporation, is working with law enforcement officials. ""Whoever did this is wrong and acted in an inappropriate manner,"" Lopez said. ""Clearly this is unacceptable."" Law enforcement officials said that Wal-Mart is now acting to limit the public address feature to a smaller number of in-store telephones. Lopez has confirmed that the New Jersey store is updating its intercom systems and that the company is looking at Sunday's episode to see if there are any lessons for the retailer's other 4,000-plus American stores.","Boy, 16, arrested on bias intimidation and harassment charges .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Russia pressed the United States on Wednesday to choose between ""a real partnership"" with Moscow or an ""illusory"" relationship with U.S. ally Georgia. Washington said it's sticking with Georgia. ""As to choosing, the United States has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of Georgia,"" Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Wednesday. She spelled out the Bush administration's stance after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called Georgia's government ""a special project for the United States."" ""And we are aware that the U.S. is uptight about this project,"" Lavrov said in remarks broadcast on Russian television. ""But a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts."" Rice, amid reports that Russian troops remained on the move Wednesday, pushed Russia to abide by a cease-fire signed Tuesday by the Russian and Georgian presidents. Russian military action in Georgia ""must stop and must stop now,"" Rice said. Rice said Moscow already faced ""quite significant"" diplomatic consequences over its conflict with Georgia before Tuesday's cease-fire agreement, which calls for Russian and Georgian troops to return to pre-conflict positions. Bush said reports he had received were contrary to Russian assurances that it had halted military operations. Bush said he was told the Russian military had blocked Georgia's major east-west highway, and had soldiers at the main port at Poti. There were reports that some ships had been attacked, he said. Russia has likely moved additional troops into the disputed Georgian provinces and into Georgia proper over the past several days, several administration officials told CNN on Wednesday. The officials said the United States now believes Russia may have 15,000 or more troops in the region. That would be an increase from the 8,000-10,000 the U.S. government estimated when the fighting began. A Bush administration official stressed that the scope of Russia's military effort remains unclear. Any violations of the cease-fire would call into question Russia's ""suitability"" as an international partner, Rice told reporters before leaving on a diplomatic trip to Europe. Bush administration officials told CNN the United States and its European allies were considering kicking Russia out of the G-8, the group of the world's largest industrial economies, and other international organizations as punishment for its actions in Georgia. Rice discounted concerns that Moscow would no longer assist Washington on thorny diplomatic issues such as efforts to halt nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea, saying it had its own interests at stake. ""Let's be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that Russia and the United States have engaged in on Iran or North Korea,"" she said. ""Again, it's not a favor to the United States."" Russia sent troops and tanks into the breakaway Georgia region of South Ossetia last week after Georgia's military acted to clamp down on Russian-linked separatists there. Separatists in South Ossetia want independence -- or unification with North Ossetia, which is in Russia. The conflict quickly spread to other parts of Georgia, including Abkhazia, another separatist region. Georgia has been a close U.S. ally, contributing troops to the war in Iraq and seeking to join NATO with Washington's support. In a CNN interview Wednesday, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili criticized the United States for not doing more to help his nation.  Watch Saakashvili fault the U.S. response » . ""America is losing the whole region, and this is the region of eastern and central Europe,"" said Saakashvili, who called for the United States and European powers to send peacekeepers to the region. ""This is much bigger than any other place where there is American influence, and this is the most natural allies of America."" But later Wednesday, in an interview with CNN's ""Situation Room,"" Saakashvili seemed to have a change of heart. He said that after speaking with President Bush earlier in the day, he felt ""there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity."" ""I never accused the United States in the first place of anything,"" he said. ""I just said that the Russians mistook some of the statements at certain levels."" Rice defended the administration's response to the fighting.  Watch Bush express support for Georgia's democracy » . ""I don't think you can have any doubt but that the United States has, from the very beginning, believed that the South Ossetian situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully, as we've been working for months and months and months to do, but that Russia seriously overreached, that Russia engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in South Ossetia,"" she said. U.S. officials said they warned Saakashvili not to provoke Russia militarily by sending Georgian troops into South Ossetia and they had ruled out any U.S. military action to defend Georgia. Rice spoke after Bush's announcement that U.S. aircraft and ships would deliver humanitarian aid to victims of the fighting. Bush and Rice warned Russia not to interfere with the delivery of humanitarian aid, noting that Tuesday's French-brokered cease-fire allows for the delivery of international relief, and expressed concern over reports that Russian units were continuing to advance into Georgian cities despite Tuesday's cease-fire.  Watch Russian tanks move toward Tbilisi » . ""We expect Russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in Georgia, and we expect all Russian forces that entered Georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country,"" Bush said. Rice will travel to France and then head to Tbilisi, Bush said. Next week, Rice will travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Russia's move into Georgia came amid a struggle between the United States and Russia for influence within Eastern Europe. From Russia's point of view, American support for Georgia is a direct threat to its influence. By striking heavily in Georgia, Moscow is sending a signal to other former Soviet republics, such as Ukraine and Moldova, said Sarah Mendelson, the director of the Human Rights and Security Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ""If I were a neighbor of Russia and I saw what Russia had done in Georgia, I would be very nervous,"" Mendelson said. ""I think those countries that are leaning toward the West are very nervous today."" CNN's Zain Verjee contributed to this report. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"Should a captive chimpanzee have the same rights as a ""legal person""? That's the debate set to unfold after an activist group filed lawsuits on behalf of four chimpanzees, asking the New York Supreme Court to grant them the ""right to bodily liberty."" ""When we go to court on behalf of the first chimpanzee plaintiffs, we'll be asking judges to recognize, for the first time, that these cognitively complex, autonomous beings have the basic legal right to not be imprisoned,"" said Steven M. Wise, founder and president of the Nonhuman Rights Project. According to the group, the four chimpanzees are all held in New York state: . • Tommy, 26, is living in a cage on a trailer lot in Gloversville. • Kiko, 26, formerly worked in the entertainment industry and is now living in Niagara Falls on private property, where he is caged. • Hercules and Leo, two young males, are owned by New Iberia Research Center and used in a locomotion research experiment in the Anatomy Department at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook. ""Not long ago, people generally agreed that human slaves could not be legal persons, but were simply the property of their owners,"" Wise said. ""We will assert, based on clear scientific evidence, that it's time to take the next step and recognize that these nonhuman animals cannot continue to be exploited as the property of their human 'owners.' "" Neither the owner of Tommy nor the owner of Kiko has responded to CNN's requests for comment. But Stony Brook University spokeswoman Lauren Sheprow said the university ""has not seen any legal papers related to this matter and therefore is unable to comment."" Morality: It's not just for humans . What is personhood? ""To be a 'legal person,' one doesn't need to be a human being or even a biological being. A corporation is a legal person,"" wrote Joyce Tischler, co-founder of the Animal Legal Defense Fund. Even if the chimpanzees don't understand what a lawsuit is, they benefit from being directly represented, she said. ""We see that in children. They can be removed from an abusive home and be protected, even though the child might not be able to formulate those desires and the issues represented in the court of law,"" Tischler told CNN. She added that Spain's parliament passed a resolution in 2008 that deemed great apes to be considered legal persons. So why not file suit on behalf of all animals? ""Lawsuits have to address a real problem faced by an individual plaintiff. You cannot sue on behalf of all animals everywhere,"" Tischler said. The lawsuits are asking for the four chimpanzees to be moved to a sanctuary ""where they can live out their days with others of their kind in an environment as close to the wild as is possible in North America,"" the Nonhuman Rights Project said. The group said it plans to file more lawsuits across the country on behalf of captive animals ""who are scientifically proven to be self aware and autonomous,"" such as elephants, dolphins and whales.

"Jeb Bush is stepping down from the board of directors at Rayonier Inc., according to a Monday filing from the forestry company. It's further evidence he is seriously mulling a presidential bid as he continues to cut his corporate ties. The two-sentence filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission states the former Florida governor notified Rayonier on Dec. 23 that he plans to resign from the board effective Dec. 31, adding that there were no disagreements between him and the company. The filing comes just days after Bush told the board at Tenet Healthcare Corporation that he would step down, also effective Dec. 31. And he decided last week to leave the board of British bank Barclays at the end of the year. Questions arose earlier this month — before Bush announced he was ""actively exploring"" a bid — about whether he was seriously interested in wanting to run for president after a Bloomberg report detailed his recent business activity. Private equity experts considered his ties unusual for a prospective candidate. But his spokesman said Bush's business interests would not stand in the way of a possible campaign.

"(CNN)Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush launched a new political action committee Tuesday in the latest move that he is moving closer to a 2016 presidential run. Bush launched the ""Right to Rise PAC"" on Tuesday, a Leadership PAC which will allow him to raise money, hire staff, travel around the country and donate to candidates and other groups that could help him lay the groundwork for a presidential run. Bush supporters also launched a Super PAC in the same name on Tuesday according to FEC filings. Super PACs can accept unlimited contributions from supporters, but will not be allowed to coordinate with the Bush campaign if he officially becomes a candidate. Veteran Republican strategist Charles Spies, who co-founded a Super PAC that buoyed Gov. Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential bid, is the new Super PAC's treasurer, according to FEC filings. Both the Leadership PAC and Super PAC list the same assistant treasurer in documents filed with the FEC on Tuesday. The move is the latest hand wave from Bush that he is leaning toward running for President as he looks to lock up top GOP donors ahead of other potential contenders. The PAC formation comes less than a week after Bush announced he was stepping down from all his corporate and nonprofit board memberships. Bush calls for 'respect' in gay marriage debate . Bush announced his move online on his Facebook and Twitter pages with a video in English and another in Spanish. He also joined Instagram.

We need to let people fail. We need to let people suffer the consequences of bad decisions,"" he wrote in 2011. Bush attributed the phrase to Rep. Paul Ryan in the editorial, but the phrase appears to trace its roots to President Abraham Lincoln.

"DOVER, Delaware (CNN) -- Police said they were interviewing a student who is a ""person of interest"" in Friday's shooting of two other students at Delaware State University. A guard checks a van entering Delaware State University Friday after two students were shot and wounded. Police were also searching for a second student -- also a person of interest -- as the university was locked down in the wake of the early morning shootings. ""This was not an act of terrorism,"" said James Overton, the school's police chief. ""This was not a crazed gunman who found his way onto the campus. What our investigation is telling us is, it was a Delaware State University student that caused this and will have to face the consequences of his actions."" University President Allen Sessoms echoed those remarks, saying the shooting appeared to be ""an internal problem for the university."" ""These are just kids who did very, very stupid things ... and we've got to deal with that,"" he said. The shootings happened after a group of eight to 10 students left the campus' Village Cafe between midnight and 1 a.m., Overton said. Some of the group gathered at a pedestrian mall in the center of campus, near Memorial Hall. Someone started shooting, Overton said, and ""approximately four to six shots were fired."" A 17-year-old male student was shot once and is hospitalized in stable condition and a 17-year-old female student was shot twice and is in serious condition, he said. University spokesman Carlos Holmes said the female student's ""injuries were more serious and they could potentially be life-threatening. We're praying, we're hoping for the best for her."" Both victims are from the Washington area, Overton said. Students, faculty and staff were directed to remain in their buildings, the school said. The lockdown, Holmes said, continued Friday afternoon for about 1,200 people living in dormitories and an apartment complex for upper-level students. The campus would be opened on a limited basis for student activities on Saturday, Overton said. Chris Reugre, a junior who lives off-campus, said he hoped police catch the other potential suspect soon. ""I heard about it this morning around 7. My dad woke me up, and I was just shocked,"" he said. ""It took me back to Virginia Tech. ... I never thought it would happen at my school. ... It's a pretty safe campus, in my opinion."" On April 16, Seung-Hui Cho killed 32 students and faculty members before killing himself on the Virginia Polytechnic Institute campus in Blacksburg, Virginia. An investigation report released in August criticized school officials after the shooting deaths. An independent investigative panel concluded that more timely and specific information by Virginia Tech officials might have saved lives. ""We have learned tremendously from the tragedy at Virginia Tech,"" Sessoms said, adding the school began notifying students almost immediately. The university posted ""timely warning notifications"" in residential halls, on Web sites and on campus phone messages, Holmes said. ""Any time you pick up a phone you automatically hear a message that lets you know the situation,"" Holmes said. ""We've used everything we have at our disposal."" Senior Franz Delima said a friend told him about the shootings at 5:30 a.m., and he immediately checked the university's Web site. ""I was shocked by the news,"" Delima said. He said a friend of his is a residential assistant in one of the dorms, and she was ""scared."" ""I'm pretty sure someone from outside did it,"" Delima said. ""The school did a good job of telling us what happened."" University personnel and students can check the status of the situation on the campus Web site at www.desu.edu and by calling (302) 857-7669. Holmes said a procedure had been set up for students who wanted to leave for the weekend. Students were allowed to leave their dorm rooms to eat on campus, but had to follow strict safety procedures, he added. He said food and other necessities would be provided to people holed up in the dorms. Several law enforcement agencies, including the Delaware State Police, were aiding the search for the gunman, Holmes said. U.S. marshals and agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also are lending forensics expertise, he said.  Watch how police are searching campus and surrounding area » . The Delaware school was struck by tragedy last month when three teens who were either enrolled at Delaware State or in the process of doing so were shot to death execution-style in a Newark, New Jersey, school yard. Another teen was wounded. Asked about the impact of the Newark killings, Afiriyie-Hwedie said, ""People are really worried, and basically some people are trying to figure out whether things are connected or not, but on the most part they don't think it is."" The university was founded in 1890 as the State College for Colored Students, a land grant college for agriculture and mechanical arts. The school now considers itself diversified. The 400-acre main campus is on the north side of Dover, Delaware's capital.

"The Gingrich campaign has now confirmed a longstanding business relationship that enabled his consulting group to receive between $1.6 and $1.8 million from mortgage giant Freddie Mac. But it wasn't for ""lobbying,"" Newt Gingrich insists. It was for ""strategic advice on a wide range of issues."" OK, but then doesn't the payment, AP's Tom Beaumont asked the former House speaker, just remind people that ""your background comes from being a Washington insider?"" ""It reminds people,"" Gingrich corrected Beaumont, ""that I know a great deal about Washington."" And as he continued,  ""If you want to change Washington, we just tried four [sic] years of amateur ignorance and it didn't work very well, so having some-body who knows Washington might be a really good thing."" Newt Gingrich is certainly right about that. There is no candidate for president who has had more experience in changing Washington than Gingrich. Indeed, there may be no American since James Madison who has had more of an effect in making the institution of Congress what it is today. For as far too few remember, more than any other living American, it is Newt Gingrich who gave us the current version of our hopelessly dysfunctional Congress — an institution which, according to a New York Times/CBS poll, now has the confidence of 9% of the American people. That monster is his baby, and no one should deny him his parental bragging rights. The question for Gingrich now, however, is whether he wants to change that institution — again. For nothing in his campaign so far has either explained what went so wrong in the practices that he helped birth, or how we might possibly reform them. And it is this, I suggest, more than anything else that Americans need ""reminding"" of. The Framers of our Constitution meant Congress to be a great deliberative body. It has become an embarrassment. Congress doesn't deliberate to resolve important national issues. Congress fundraises, and postures to fundraise, to support the next fight for control. The transformation to this ""Fundraising Congress"" began in 1993. Newt Gingrich was its leader. After claiming Republican control of both houses of Congress in 1995 — for the first time in 40 years — Gingrich launched his new army of reformers on a project to secure permanent control of that institution, and of government. Fundraising was the key to that strategy of control. The Republicans came to power raising a then unheard of amount of money: $618.42 million in the election cycle ending in 1994, compared to the Democrats' $488.68 million. In the four years between 1994 and 1998, Republican candidates and party committees would raise over $1 billion. Never before had a party come anywhere close to raising that amount of money, because never before had any party's leaders so effectively focused the energy of their members on this single task: fundraising. Gingrich concentrated the ""work"" of Congress into a three-day ""work"" week. He sent his caucus home for the rest of the week, in part so that they had time necessary to launch cross-country fundraising missions. He exploded the number of committees, radically increasing the number of fund-raising targets. He ended any idea of bipartisanship. Instead, as Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tennessee, has described, the focus of Congress after Gingrich's reforms became the ""majority of the majority,"" (i.e., the majority of the Republicans) polarizing the institution to the end of assuring ever more loyal and energized troops. Members of Congress now spend between 30%-70% of their time raising money to get re-elected to Congress or to get their party back into power. And not just the Republicans: The Democrats quickly followed the lessons of Professor Gingrich. And in the almost 20 years since he came to power, practically everything about that great institution has changed. Gone is any semblance of deliberation, or the idea that there is a business of the nation to be done, as opposed to the business of the party in power. Instead, the institution that Gingrich inherited — the one in which Democrats worked with Republicans to pass the most important tax reform in modern history (Reagan's), and in which Republicans led Democrats to break a filibuster in the Senate and pass the most important social legislation in a century (The Civil Rights Act of 1964) — was gone. What replaced it is the completely dysfunctional institution which practically no American has confidence in today. More important to the right, as the business of Congress became the business of fundraising, the ideals that had brought Gingrich to power quickly got compromised. Fundraising demands pushed the Republican leadership to give up on its stated goal of shrinking the size of government, so that it could better use the power of majority status to raise campaign cash. As the Washington Post's Robert Kaiser reported in his 2009 book, ""So Damn Much Money"": . ""Republicans took over ... determined to cut the government down to size. [But] their ambitions were soon compromised. ... Gingrich initially supported ... efforts to impose discipline on spending.... But in the face of perceived political necessity, the leadership wavered. Cutting spending was good, but Gingrich, (Dick) Armey, (Tom) DeLay, and others quickly realized that 'we have another aspect to our existence here, which is that we must use the Appropriations Committee as a resource to protect our vulnerables, because once we got into power, we wanted to stay in power.'"" The job of Congress was no longer the work of the nation. The job of Congress was to help its majority ""to stay in power."" This is the legacy of Speaker Gingrich. It has been followed by Republicans and Democrats alike. It is a legacy that has done the nation great harm. And much more important than the question of how Gingrich might have profited personally from the economy of influence that he helped build is the question of whether, and how, he now intends to ""change"" it. So it is perfectly true, Mr. Speaker, that you have the most ""change"" experience of any candidate for president. So would you use it this time to do good?  Or would you continue to defend the practices that have destroyed the crown jewel of the Framers' Republic: Congress.","Lawrence Lessig: Gingrich fundamentally changed nature of Congress .

""He had made a comment that was very similar to what Dick Cheney said about a month or two ago, which was basically, 'Why are we talking the environment when ISIS is out there?'

"" Last month, Paul blasted Clinton for saying climate change marked the ""most consequential, urgent, sweeping collection of challenges we face."" ""I don't think we really want a commander in chief who's battling climate change instead of terrorism,"" Paul said on Fox News. Maher said that Paul's answer on the environment was ""wholly unsatisfactory"" and that the senator would lose his vote based entirely on that issue unless Paul comes up with a better answer.

"Fears of a possibly nuclear-armed Iran took center stage early in Thursday night's vice presidential debate between incumbent Democrat Joe Biden and his Republican challenger, Paul Ryan. ""When Barack Obama was elected, they had enough fissile material, nuclear material, to make one bomb. Now they have enough to make five,"" Ryan said. ""They're racing toward a nuclear weapon. They're four years closer toward a nuclear weapons capability."" The Wisconsin congressman said Iran's progress has sped along ""because this administration has no credibility on this issue."" Biden hit back by criticizing what he called ""bluster"" and ""loose talk"" about the issue, saying international sanctions are crippling the Iranian economy and that U.S. and Israeli officials believe Iran is ""a good way away"" from getting the bomb. Fact Check: What about security in Benghazi? The facts: . Iran has greatly expanded its ability to produce nuclear fuel in the past four years, revealing a second uranium enrichment plant in 2009 and continuing to defy U.N. demands that it halt work until questions about its intentions are resolved. A bit of tech talk here: About three-quarters of 1% of naturally occurring uranium is uranium-235, the radioactive isotope used to produce a nuclear reaction. To produce fuel for nuclear power plants, that concentration has to be increased to 3 to 5%, while research reactors use fuel with a U-235 concentration of about 20%. To make a nuclear weapon, that concentration has to be increased to more than 90%. As of May, Iran had produced about 6,200 kilograms (13,640 pounds) of power plant-grade uranium and 146 kilograms (320 pounds) of fuel at 20% concentration, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog. Based on those figures, the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, estimated that Iran could produce enough weapons-grade uranium for five nuclear bombs. The organization, led by former U.N. weapons inspector David Albright, says Iran could build a crude bomb with 20-25 kg (44-55 pounds) of highly enriched uranium. However, it would take Iran more than two months to produce that amount if it started with 20%-grade uranium, and ""several months"" to make enough for a bomb using low-enriched uranium. That would give the world community enough time to detect the operation and organize a response, ISIS noted in June. And there's more to building a bomb than just having the uranium, as Biden noted. ISIS estimated last week, that Iran would need ""many additional months"" to develop a device that could be tested ""and even longer to make a reliable warhead for a ballistic missile."" Fact Check: Wind power, electric cars and the stimulus . Iran has denied conducting any nuclear weapons research, insisting its nuclear program is for civilian purposes. The IAEA has verified that Iran has not diverted any of its declared uranium stock, but cautions that Iran ""is not providing the necessary cooperation"" to verify that all nuclear work is peaceful. Israel has accused Iran of working toward a nuclear weapon, raising concerns that it could launch a preventive attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. Israel is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal, but has never disclosed whether it has the bomb -- and Iran has accused Israel and the United States of trying to sabotage its nuclear facilities. As for the United States, American intelligence agencies believe Iran ""is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons"" but has not made the decision to build a bomb, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a Senate committee in January. Conclusion: According to at least one widely circulated estimate, Iran could produce enough uranium for five bombs, as Ryan says. But the same estimate notes that it would draw attention if it did so, and that's only part of the work necessary to make a weapon.

"(CNN) -- A sailor is accusing the Navy of baselessly trying to discharge him for ""unprofessional conduct"" in an effort to get around the recent ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal, after being found asleep in the same bed with another male sailor. Navy Petty Officer Stephen Jones, a student at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Charleston, South Carolina, told CNN that on the night of February 5, a male sailor stopped by to watch the CW TV show ""Vampire Diaries."" ""He has come over to watch shows in the past,"" Jones said. The two watched the show on his bed but accidentally fell asleep. Jones says his roommate walked in around midnight. ""My roommate walked in and it woke me up,"" Jones said. He then woke up his friend, Navy Petty Officer Bryan McGee, who according to Jones, immediately left the room. But the Navy is proceeding with discharging Jones, charging him with ""willful failure to exhibit professional conduct,"" Jones' lawyer, Greg Myers said. ""It is a violation of the Command Instruction for sailors to act unprofessionally in the barracks. It is considered unprofessional conduct to share the same bed in Navy barracks,"" said Thomas Dougan, a spokesman for the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command. Jones, who claims nothing sexual happened, said they were both clothed, him in pajama pants and a white t-shirt and McGee in boxers, and that two were not under the covers together. Jones was lying above the covers while McGee lay below. The play-by-play given by Jones is substantiated by the Naval investigating documents, although a different account on the amount of clothing worn was given by Jones' roommate who claimed in his naval statement that both sailors were only dressed in their boxers. Jones' roommate, who was uncomfortable by what he saw, according to Myers, Jones' attorney, moved out of the room a day later and reported the incident to command officials. An investigation was launched, ending with the Command attempting to punish Jones and McGee by a ""Captain's Mast,"" a non-judicial procedure meant to avoid a court martial. McGee, who declined to comment on the case, accepted the mast and punishment but Jones refused, moving the Navy to begin proceedings to discharge him. Punishment by Captain's Mast could have resulted in loss of rank, forfeiture of pay, or jeopardized Jones' top secret security clearance, Myers said. ""I'm not pleading guilty to something that I didn't do. I did not commit a crime,"" said Jones. ""I am the type of person that takes responsibility for my actions. If I break a rule, I take my punishment. And I know I did not break any rules."" Myers also said he is adamant that no crime was committed. ""In the end, Jones was charged with falling asleep while watching a show on his computer while on his bed over the covers where another man under the covers was also sleeping. This is not a crime and never will be as there was and is no duty to avoid such a circumstance as a matter of laws,"" said Myers in a statement sent to the Navy. Jones and his lawyer charge that the Naval Command suspects Jones of being gay and wants to discharge him for that reason alone. ""This Command suspects that Jones is a homosexual but has no proof. It cannot invoke 'don't ask, don't tell' because there is no homosexual conduct and there is no admission of homosexuality. Yet this homophobic Command is using its suspicions to reach the same result as though there were,"" said Myers. ""This is bigotry disguised as the rule of law."" Jones would not comment on his sexual orientation saying, ""that is my business and my business alone"". President Obama signed the so-called ""don't ask, don't tell"" repeal into law in December but it's not officially off the books until Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the President give the OK that the military is ready to implement the repeal. For now, the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy remains in place, although no military personnel have been discharged under that policy since October, when Gates changed procedures to have such separations reviewed at the highest levels, a point, Myers says, was not forgotten by the Naval Command. ""The Secretary of Defense has said that 'don't ask, don't tell' cases will be reviewed at the highest levels. This case is disguised as misconduct to avoid that result,"" said Myers. ""This is a subterfuge being used by this Commander because he does not have the elements of proof to separate him for homosexuality, but he suspects homosexuality, so he has created this illusion that Stephen has engaged in misconduct of some form."" The Navy denies the separation proceedings are based on the suspicion of homosexual behavior. ""Naval Nuclear Power Training Command is not administratively processing either of these sailors for separation based on sexual orientation,"" said Dougan. But one gay rights group worries this case may be an example of some in the military trying to get around the ""don't ask don't tell"" repeal by charging suspected homosexuals with other offenses. ""We've seen this before,"" said Alex Nicholson, executive director of Servicemembers United, the nation's largest organization of gay and lesbian troops and veterans. ""Here is the classic text book case of trumping up charges and exaggerating an event to try to punish someone. And this is exactly what the senior defense leadership has said would not and should not happen when DADT goes away."" For now, the 21-year-old Jones says that even though he is disappointed in the Naval Command, he just wants to keep his job and finish his training to become a nuclear operator on an aircraft carrier or a submarine. ""I enjoyed my job. I enjoyed the environment and I was interested in what I was learning. It has been challenging but it was definitely something that I wanted to complete,"" said Jones.","Petty Officer Stephen Jones says he fell asleep with another sailor while watching television .
His roommate caught the two sailors sleeping and reported them to supervisors .
The NAVY has said the sleepover is a violation and unprofessional ."
"Maine authorities gave their most dire judgment yet Thursday as to what they believe happened to missing toddler Ayla Reynolds, with a police spokesman saying ""there's nothing we have found that leads us to believe she's alive."" ""Based on everything we know -- the thousands of hours of investigation, the 1,127 leads that have come in, the searches, the dives and the evidence gathered -- we think it's highly unlikely that Ayla Reynolds will be found alive,"" said state police spokesman Stephen McCausland. ""Nothing points us in that direction. Ayla was 20 months old when her father, Justin DiPietro told police he had put her to bed around 8 p.m. on December 16 in a first-floor bedroom of her grandmother's Waterville, Maine, home. The toddler's father, her aunt and the father's girlfriend were in the home at that time. DiPietro called police the next morning, just before 9 a.m., to report Ayla missing. Authorities believe, as they have said previously, that there was ""foul play"" involved in the girl's disappearance and they opened a criminal probe, McCausland told reporters Thursday. But her body has not been found and no one has been named a suspect in the case. ""She did not leave that home by herself, and she was not abducted,"" the state police spokesman said. On Thursday, as he has done previously, McCausland suggested the adults in the house with Ayla the night before she was reported missing -- including her father -- have not been totally forthcoming. The police spokesman said there has not been ""a lot of communication with the three adults who were inside the home that night."" At the same time, he said ""it's way premature to start speculating on charging anyone."" ""They were the adults and they were there, and they may have answers,"" said McCausland. ""Justin was the father, (and) we believe he knows more than he has told us."" Authorities called Ayla's parents shortly before Thursday's press conference to tell them they'd be stating they presume their daughter is dead. The toddler's mother, Trista Reynolds, was ""thankful for the call,"" said McCausland, as was DiPietro. As for the father, ""His reaction was no reaction,"" the spokesman said. Local attorney John Nale announced at Thursday's press conference that the $30,000 reward offered for information leading to Ayla or the arrest of the person or persons responsible for her disappearance would expire at the end of June. The hope is that someone will come forward in the next 30 days. Even if they do not, authorities vow that the lapse in the reward offer has no bearing on the investigation. To that point, McCausland promised there will be more searches and that -- even though police are now stating they believe Ayla is dead -- ""this is still a missing person's case."" ""We are committed to this investigation, no matter how long it takes,"" said Waterville Police Chief Joe Massey, noting two members of his department will remain assigned to the case.","Ayla Reynolds was 20 months old when her father reported her missing .
166 days later, her body hasn't been found and no one's been named a suspect .

"The family of ISIS hostage and U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig released a YouTube video Saturday asking his captors to show mercy and free him. Referring to him as Abdul-Rahman -- a first name his family says he took, having converted to Islam while being held hostage -- father Ed Kassig said: ""We implore his captors to show mercy and use their power to let our son go."" Peter Kassig, 26, first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier and returned as a medical worker, feeling compelled to help victims of war. His mother, Paula, addressed her son in the video: ""We are so very proud of you and the work you have done to bring humanitarian aid to the Syrian people,"" she said. ""Most of all, know that we love you, and our hearts ache for you to be granted your freedom so we can hug you again and then set you free to continue the life you have chosen, the life of service to those in greatest need,"" she added. The couple noted they were releasing the video on the same day of Islam's Eid al-Adah or the Festival of Sacrifice, when Muslims slaughter lambs, goats, sheep and cattle and distribute the meat to the poor and their families. The holiday coincides with the end of the hajj pilgrimage and commemorates Allah's sparing Abraham from sacrificing his son Ishmael. A native of Indiana, Peter Kassig founded Special Emergency Response and Assistance, a nongovernmental organization aiding Syrians fleeing the civil war there. Since 2012, he delivered food and medical supplies within and outside Syria and provided trauma care and training, his family said. But on October 1, 2013, he was ""detained"" on his way to Deir Ezzor in eastern Syria while performing a project for SERA, his family said. Peter Kassig's life was threatened Friday in an ISIS video that showed the apparent beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning. In a statement Friday, Kassig's parents, Ed and Paula Kassig of Indianapolis, confirmed that their son was being held hostage by ISIS but provided no other details on his abduction. They had maintained silence about his capture since he was taken hostage in 2013. ""The Kassig family extends our concern for the family of Alan Henning,"" Kassig's parents said. ""We ask everyone around the world to pray for the Henning family, for our son, and for the release of all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe."" Joined the Army in 2006 . Kassig's journey began when he joined the U.S. Army Rangers in 2006 and deployed to Iraq in 2007. He was honorably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour  and returned to the United States to study political science and train for 1,500-meter races. But something wasn't right. ""I was going to school with kids who look the same, were the same age as me, but we weren't the same,"" he said. ""I wanted more of a challenge, a sense of purpose."" Portraits of conflict: Can an image stop the bloodshed? In 2010, Kassig took time off and began his certification as an emergency medical technician. In the two years that followed, he fell in love, got married and quickly divorced. Devastated and heartbroken, he went back to school, but he couldn't shake his depression. ""I needed a game-changer,"" he said. He decided he would head to Beirut, follow the situation in Syria and try to help. So, on his spring break this year he packed his medical kit and flew into the Lebanese capital. The next two weeks were filled with eye-opening misadventures as Kassig began to scratch the surface of the complexities of the Syrian conflict and the Middle East as a whole. Founded a humanitarian aid organization . ""I had learned enough to know that I didn't know anything,"" he said. After finishing the semester back in the United States, he returned to Lebanon, only this time with a plan. ""The way I saw it, I didn't have a choice. This is what I was put here to do. I guess I am just a hopeless romantic, and I am an idealist, and I believe in hopeless causes."" Kassig then founded SERA, and in summer 2013 he moved its base of operations to Gaziantep, Turkey. Kassig's family said SERA was dedicated to providing first-response humanitarian aid for refugees fleeing the widening civil war in Syria. ""I am not a doctor. I am not a nurse,"" he said in the 2012 interview. ""But I am a guy who can clean up bandages, help clean up patients, swap out bandages, help run IVs, make people's quality of life a little bit better. This is something for me that has meaning, that has purpose."" Converted to Islam . Kassig's family said he converted to Islam while being held hostage and now goes by Abdul-Rahman. The family said they understand, ""from speaking to former hostages, that Kassig's faith has provided him comfort during his long captivity."" While working in hospitals, some of those Kassig helped treat were rebel fighters, all who vowed they would return to the battlefield as soon as they could. Others were the innocent victims of a spiraling conflict. One patient, 24-year-old Louliya, said she and her three children were run over by a military jeep as they tried to escape the Syrian military siege of their village. Her spinal cord was crushed, leaving her unable to move from the neck down. She was smuggled across the border to Lebanon for surgery. She smiled bravely but was unable to stop the tears from rolling down her face. ""All I want is to be able to hold my children in my arms again,"" she said softly, trying but failing to imitate the cradling of a child. Despite dangers, doctors honor oath in a secret Syrian field hospital . He bonded with doctors, patients . Kassig said his direct exposure to what was something of an alien conflict and culture before transformed his perspective. ""There is this mentality from where I come from back home that I have a little bit of a problem with,"" he  said. ""I don't want to get on a political soap box, but at the same time we have to think about why as a country we choose to help certain people and not others. ""We have to think about why we just chalk up the Middle East [as] this complex enigma that we will never understand because they are so different from us. But at the end of the day, they are really not. It's just about whether or not you're willing to go out on a limb and understand something,"" he said. ""Peter can tell the American people who we are,"" said Marwan, a Syrian nurse he worked with. ""We are not what the regime says we are -- terrorists and al Qaeda. Peter knows we are good people, who love joking and laughter. We just want to live."" Kassig was struck by the resilience of the Syrians he met, by their ability to smile and somehow joke even in the darkest of circumstances. ""This is real, and it's scary stuff, and it's sad what is happening to people here,"" he  said. ""People back home need to know about it, they need to know. Sometimes you gotta take a stand, you gotta draw a line somewhere."" When outrage isn't enough . Your take: Intervene or not?","Ed and Paula Kassig urge ISIS to release their son .

"Last week, a member of Congress, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, actually defended the way that Congress does its business. Give him credit for originality. Rather than the usual refrain of blasting Washington as a dysfunctional and corrupt city, Reid disagreed with President Barack Obama and said: ""I have been a fan of earmarks since I got here the first day. I disagree -- underline, underscored, big exclamation mark -- with Obama. He's wrong."" He opposes the ban on earmarks that Congress put into place three years ago following the Republican victories in the 2010 midterm elections. Earmarks, historically referred to as a form of ""pork-barrel spending"", are measures that House and Senate members add to bills to benefit people in their own districts. In response to Reid's comments, there was the predictable backlash of criticism. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, warned that ""The American public think it's a sick way to run a business, to have to bribe somebody to get something done and politicians use it to look good at home."" In The Wall Street Journal, Coburn pushed back against calls to bring back a little pork by writing, ""restoring earmarks in today's Congress would be like opening a bar tab for a bunch of recovering alcoholics."" But Reid has a point, and many Republicans who spent much of their careers mastering the art of congressional spending agree with him -- even though many are scared to say so in public. Indeed, even with the recent ""ban"", according to the conservative Citizens against Government Waste, the 2014 budget included almost $2.7 billion in spending for projects requested by individual legislators (much of which went to defense and national security projects). Legislators have found new ways (called lettermarking or phonemarking) to obtain these kinds of appropriations, though in smaller scale than before. Congressional earmarks and pork barrel spending have a long history in the United States. They have served important purposes that are too often overlooked. Most important, this kind of congressional spending has been vital to successful negotiation on Capitol Hill. Presidents and party leaders have traditionally depended on their influence to insert measures in congressional spending bills to persuade legislators to join them in voting for key legislation that is important to the national interest. Often, earmarked spending has been the most important tool in the effort to persuade legislators to vote against their interests or their traditional position. During the battle over the Civil Rights Act of 1964, President Lyndon Johnson needed as many votes as possible to overcome the Southern filibuster against the bill in the Senate. One of the ways in which Johnson won over a key vote, that of Arizona Democrat Carl Hayden, was to let him know that the administration would throw its support behind a Central Arizona Water Project that the senator's constituents desperately wanted. In exchange Hayden, one of the many Westerners who had traditionally refused to vote to end any filibuster, agreed to vote for cloture if his support was needed in the end. Without a little pork, Johnson would have been unable to obtain his support. We can even see how earmarked spending has proved effective at the state and local level. In New York, the state famously littered university campuses in as many legislative districts as possible so that the state system would have broad and durable support. This worked. The outcome was ongoing, bipartisan support for investment in higher education that has been vital to the residents of New York. Earmarked spending also fits into our respect for decentralized and localized decision-making. When legislators lobby for spending within their district, they are usually responding to the pressures and demands that emanate from the local level. To be sure there are many examples of outrageous earmarks that don't have much justification or value. Political speeches and newspaper stories are filled with accounts of this kind of useless pork. However, for every ""bridge to nowhere"" there are congressional earmarks that fund university research and public works programs that play a vital role for Americans. Peg McGlinch writes in U.S. News and World Report that the Minnesota congressional delegation obtained about $2 million in earmarked funding that was used to provide more services for members of the National Guard who returned from Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Earmarks,"" she writes, ""have funded hundreds of job training programs, paved roads that reduced traffic, supported the police officers protecting our streets, underwritten research on diseases, revitalized blighted neighborhoods, developed technologies to improve national defense, built libraries and schools and given children opportunities to learn."" Earmarked spending is a good way to build broad and durable party support for important public policies. Very often, crafting programs that provide pork to legislators has been an effective way to broaden support for a policy. During the New Deal, FDR was keen to provide money to the districts of key Northern legislators so that they would become politically invested in his public works program. That program offered key relief to American workers during the height of the Great Depression. The complex patchwork of military defense contracting throughout the Sunbelt, often a result of legislative efforts to get money to valuable districts, was essential for Republicans in building support for a muscular national security policy against the Soviet Union. So earmarks have their function and Reid has a point. Members of both parties understand that this has been key. The legislative process is not pretty, but there have been many moments when Congress has accomplished big things -- and earmarked spending has been critical to success. It might be time to push back a little on our anti-Washington sentiment and look more carefully at the value of some of the seemingly uglier sides of our political process.  Indeed, restoring the pork barrel might help move Congress beyond its current dysfunctional state. Earmarks would be the place to start.","Sen. Harry Reid spoke out in favor of earmarks, disagreeing with President Obama .
Julian Zelizer says Reid is right; there are benefits from dispensing political pork .

"Yes, Ebola is a scary infectious disease. But the first thing you should know is that it's not very contagious -- ""Common sense and observation tell us that spread of the virus via coughing or sneezing is rare, if it happens at all,"" the World Health Organization says. It's spread through frequent contact with bodily fluids and can be spread only by someone who is showing symptoms. So if they're not feeling sick ... Many viruses can hide in the body and spread from person to person without causing any symptoms in the people it infects. Ebola isn't like that. ""Ebola doesn't spread before someone gets sick,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday. ""Ebola does not spread ... from someone who doesn't have fever and other symptoms."" Symptoms generally occur abruptly eight to 10 days after infection, though that period can range from two to 21 days. As people with the Ebola virus become sicker, they become more infectious, experts say. The virus can also spread through bodily fluids after the patient dies. And by 'bodily fluids,' you mean? Blood, sweat, feces, vomit, semen and spit. Basically any kind of fluid that comes from the body. People in West Africa are avoiding hugs and handshakes because the virus can be spread through the sweat on someone's hand. The uninfected person would have to have a break in the skin of their hand that would allow entry of the virus, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta says. But ""we all have minor breaks in our skin. And there is a possibility that some of the virus can be transmitted that way."" Health care providers -- or family and friends -- caring for Ebola patients are often at the highest risk of getting sick because they are most likely to come in contact with the body fluids of sick patients, according to the CDC. People with Ebola suffer from extreme vomiting, diarrhea and high fevers, which causes sweating. In the later stages, they may start bleeding from their eyes, mouth or other orifices. Ebola virus: Nine things to know about the killer disease . Bottom line? ""This is not an airborne transmission,"" said Dr. Marty Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. ""There needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood."" Close contact . While the Ebola virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism, Doctors Without Borders says, agents such as chlorine, heat, direct sunlight, soaps and detergents can kill it. Could Ebola spread around the world via air travel? While the CDC acknowledges it is possible for a person infected with Ebola in West Africa to get on a plane and arrive in another country -- which is apparently what happened in the U.S. case -- the chances of the virus spreading during the journey are low. That's unless your fellow passenger is bleeding, sweating profusely or vomiting on you, of course. ""It is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel,"" the International Air Transport Association said. Travelers should take precautions by avoiding areas experiencing outbreaks and avoiding contact with Ebola patients.","Ebola is spread by someone who has become sickened by the virus .
From there, the actual transmission occurs through contact with bodily fluids .
Those bodily fluids include sweat, blood and feces .
The virus can also spread through bodily fluids after the infected victim dies ."
"(Wired) -- It appears that technology giant Samsung is handing out free Galaxy S smartphones to iPhone 4 owners frustrated by reception problems. An account on Twitter called @samsungukmobile is contacting people who've tweeted about their difficulties with the handset, asking them to submit their contact details to receive a free handset. One of those offered a handset was Tiffany Nieuwland, who told Wired: ""My iPhone and I have been inseparable for almost a month now, tomorrow being one month since the iPhone OS 4 launched. But the honeymoon period ended this week as repeated dropped calls, and a sudden unexplainable inability to make or receive calls or send texts left me disgruntled. ""So I did what anyone else would do: I vented my frustration on Twitter. Imagine my surprise, then, when this morning I am tweeted by Samsung offering me a free Galaxy S, their latest phone. Too good to be true? I decided to investigate. ""I called a friend at Samsung, and though she was initially sceptical, it has now been confirmed: the campaign is legit. Samsung is so confident about the superiority of the Galaxy S that they're sending free ones to existing iPhone customers so they can decide for themselves."" It's an interesting and unconventional approach to marketing the device, which is powered by Android 2.1 and features a whopping great big 4.0-inch AMOLED display. It's entirely possible that Samsung has taken a gamble that getting a few of the devices out in the wild, so that people can see and play with them, will be worth the initial outlay in terms of the effect they'll have on sales. Tiffany added: ""I've been waiting for an excuse to try out an Android for months, but it is yet to be seen if I can be persuaded to stray."" Would you convert to Android if the phone was offered up free? Tell us in the comments. Update: We've got official word from Samsung that this is legitimate. A spokesperson for the company told us: ""Recently there has been a real increase in online activity from consumers dissatisfied with some of our competitors' products.

"(CNN)Manchester City and Chelsea, two of the richest clubs in world soccer, were knocked out of the English FA Cup by lower league opposition on a day of shocks and awe. At the Etihad Stadium, Manchester City -- who are the current Premier League champions and whose Middle Eastern owners have spent close to $1.5 billion assembling the most expensive squad in the league's history --  lost to second tier Middlesbrough 2-0. Frank Lampard looked to have secured a last minute draw but his free kick instead hit the post. A few seconds later Middlesbrough scored a second, securing a famous victory. Chelsea out . But arguably the bigger shock took place In west London.At Stamford Bridge Chelsea, the current Premier League leaders who have looked imperious all season, took an early two goal lead against Bradford City, who play in English football's third tier. An easy victory looked on the cards. But Chelsea somehow conspired to throw away their lead as Bradford City scored an incredible four goals without reply. It was the first time Chelsea have conceded four goals against opposition two leagues below them since the 1950s. Before the game Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho said it would be ""a disgrace"" if his team lost Saturday's game. He didn't mince his words after the match either. ""I am ashamed,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports. ""The players should feel exactly the same."" Wow that still hasn't sunk in! What a day...2-0 down. Fans during and after game were unbelievable #everywherewego pic.twitter.com/z6ofDlVinX . Giantkillers . The English FA Cup has long been famous for its tradition of seeing smaller teams upsetting the odds and beating more established opposition. ""In this moment I feel happy for them. I am honest,"" Mourinho said of Bradford City's performance. The Portuguese coach, who has won the UEFA Champions League twice, visited Bradford City's dressing room after the game and congratulated the team on their performance. ""This is beauty of the FA Cup,"" he added. ""This happens here more than any other country."" More shocks . Elsewhere it wasn't a good day for the top half of the English Premier League. Southampton, who are currently third, were also knocked out after losing 3-2 to Crystal Palace whilst Tottenham Hotspur, in sixth, lost 2-1 to recently promoted Leicester City. Swansea, in ninth place, lost to Blackburn 3-1. On Friday fifth placed Manchester United narrowly avoided losing to Cambridge United, who play in English football's fourth tier. Louis Van Gaal's expensively assembled team could not break down the fourth division team, who featured former Manchester United academy player Luke Chadwick, once a contemporary of David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs. The match finished 0-0, securing Cambridge United -- whose entire yearly wage bill is the same as Argentina international Angel Di Maria's monthly paycheck  -- a replay at Old Trafford and a place in the fifth round draw. ""The atmosphere in the stadium with the crowd was fantastic,"" Van Gaal told the BBC after the game. ""I can only give the credit to Cambridge United ... every aspect of the match was against us; the pitch, the referee, everything."" Holders Arsenal through . Sunday's action went more to form, with holders Arsenal winning 3-2 at second-flight Brighton. Goals from Theo Walcott, Mesut Ozil and Tomas Rosicky put the Gunners 3-1 ahead although Sam Baldock's late second for the home side led to a few late scares. Fellow EPL sides Aston Villa and West Ham also progressed with 2-1 and 1-0 wins over Bournemouth and Bristol City respectively.","Chelsea, Man City, Southampton, Tottenham out of the FA Cup .

"When jury selection gets underway in a Phoenix courtroom on Monday, attorneys may be hard-pressed to find jurors untainted by news of the case against Jodi Arias. Lurid details about how the former waitress seduced her lover and left a trail of pictures depicting their sex play, before shooting and nearly decapitating him, created a media sensation for months during her 2013 trial. A new jury will be tasked with determining punishment after her first jury found her guilty of first-degree murder but deadlocked on whether she should be put to death for the 2008 murder of her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander, who was stabbed 29 times, had his neck slit from ear to ear and shot in the face. ""She's very scared,"" said Donavan Bering, a friend of Arias. ""Things changed for her. She came to the realization that she didn't want the death penalty. She wants to be able to see her mom and her family."" After efforts to settle the case went nowhere and legal motions to drop the death penalty were denied, Arias will resume the fight for her life with the help of a lead attorney, Kirk Nurmi, that she neither wants or trusts. ""I do not trust his advice and especially do not trust how he might conduct himself towards me because I know from personal experience that he is curt, rude and condescending,"" she wrote in a 12-page, single-spaced handwritten letter to the judge in October of 2013. When her efforts to replace him were unsuccessful, she persuaded the judge to let her represent herself, but then changed her mind weeks before the start of her retrial. The defense team is made up of Nurmi, Jennifer Willmott and mitigation specialist Maria Delarosa. Sex, lies and digital images . While Arias has the same defense team, trial strategy could be a lot different if Nurmi follows the advice of jury foreman William Zervakos, who shared his thoughts with the defense team when they met with him to discuss the case. ""Jodi Arias is her own worst enemy. She's a terrible defendant,"" said Zervakos, one of the four jurors who voted to spare her life. ""I was candid with them. I told them it was best if she were not on the stand."" ""The strategy this time is to keep Jodi off the stand,"" said a source close to the defense. ""However, Jodi has a mind of her own."" Arias spent 18 days on the witness stand recalling the minutiae of her allegedly abusive relationship with Alexander, but claimed to have no recollection of the actual attack. The trial was rife with sex, lies and digital images, including graphic autopsy photos that showed Alexander's body. But the 2013 hung jury brought to a close a dramatic chapter in a high-profile case that lasted months, drawing spectators who lined up for courtroom seats and waited anxiously outside the courthouse. Emotions ran high in the courtroom as the jury's inability to agree on a sentence was announced. Arias appeared to be on the verge of tears. One of Alexander's sisters sobbed. Even the normally stoic judge's voice cracked as she dismissed jurors. ""Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the participants in this trial, I wish to thank you for your extraordinary service to this community,"" she told them. ""This was not your typical trial. You were asked to perform very difficult responsibilities."" An alternate juror and a juror who was on the panel cried as the verdict was being read. As the jury filed out of the courtroom, one juror said, ""I'm sorry"" to Alexander's family. Jurors had deliberated for more than 13 hours in the penalty phase of the trial when they told the court they wouldn't be able to agree on a verdict. ""We'll never know what happened, and whatever triggered that rage,"" said Zervakos. ""She must be held accountable. But up until then, she had led a relatively normal life."" Witnesses threatened and intimidated? The jury foreman found mitigating evidence in her lack of criminal history and was not persuaded by the state's argument that the murder was premeditated. Despite the heavy social media backlash from people who wanted the death penalty for Arias, Zervakos said time has only made him more comfortable with in his decision. Arias needs only to persuade one juror to vote in her favor to avoid the death penalty. While the odds may seem favorable, it is a formidable challenge for a defense team that has complained that their witnesses have been threatened, intimidated and bullied into silence by ""haters"" who loathe Arias. ""It's impossible to get a fair trial with all the publicity this case has received,"" said a source close to the defense. ""We had several witnesses who backed down because they are so afraid to support Jodi."" The jury is expected to hear the state argue that the murder was especially cruel and heinous, a violent attack that included dozens of stab wounds, a knife wound to the neck that went down to the spine, and a bullet to the head. Arias' behavior before and after the murder -- allegedly stealing her grandfather's gun, getting rid of incriminating evidence, including the weapons used in the attack, and a rendezvous with a prospective lover hours after killing Alexander -- are likely fodder for the state's case for the death penalty. The reluctance of defense witnesses to testify may also have something to do with the aggressive style of prosecutor Juan Martinez, whose cross of defense expert Alyce LaViolette caused her such anxiety she sought medical help during the trial. She refused to return for the retrial, telling CNN's Ted Rowlands: ""Threats to my life, threats to my family. My family doesn't want me to go back."" LaViolette wasn't the only defense witness raked over the coals by Martinez, who mocked the professionalism of defense psychologist Richard Samuels, suggesting his judgment was clouded by his fondness for Arias. The psychologist testified that one of the reasons for Arias' amnesia was post-traumatic stress disorder. The exchanges between Martinez and Samuels became so heated during trial that defense attorney Jennifer Willmott pleaded with the judge to intervene and ""tell (the prosecutor) stop yelling at the witness."" While some of Arias' witnesses have abandoned the case, the defense has cobbled together a ""handful of witnesses,"" their names kept secret and their testimony spared the pressure of live TV coverage by a court order, said the source close to the defense. Judge Sherry Stephens ruled that while TV cameras will be permitted in the retrial, no video can be aired until a verdict has been rendered. Her decision came after the defense argued that live TV coverage would keep their witnesses from testifying. ""There will be people testifying that now feel safe where they didn't before,"" said Bering, Arias' friend.

"London (CNN)We've just landed a washing machine-sized robot on a comet and NASA's chief scientist has no idea. Dr Ellen Stofan is deep in conversation with a journalist when, unable to contain himself any longer, an adviser with phone triumphantly held aloft blurts out: ""Rosetta -- It's landed!"" ""Wonderful"" Stofan beams, and the handful of reporters gathered in a lecture theater at University College London excitedly fidget in their seats. Barely has the probe touched down on a comet 310 million miles from Earth, then one of science's great minds is discussing humanity's next cosmic milestone. Stofan wants to land a man on Mars by the mid-2030s. Or rather, ""land a human on Mars,"" the mother-of-three corrects me with a wry smile. ""In a sense it's our destiny to move beyond this planet and Mars is the logical choice,"" said the 53-year-old geologist. ""It's a place where humans could live and work -- not out in the open -- but with not too-radical modifications."" Indeed, life on the 'Red Planet' may not just be the stuff of science fiction. ""Mars is the other body in the solar system that we're very likely to find that life evolved,"" said Stofan. ""So being able to have a laboratory on Mars, being able to have some sort of sustained human presence on Mars in the future, I think is critically important for science."" Next stop: Mars . Surviving an eight-month journey to Mars is one thing -- staying alive once there is another. Astronauts would face high levels of radiation -- ""we still have to figure out how to adequately protect them,"" said Stofan. The thin atmosphere would also make landing difficult, particularly for a heavy spaceship loaded with equipment and people. ""If you think of the Apollo capsule coming into Earth with a parachute, the Mars atmosphere is just so thin you've got to find some way of slowing yourself down really rapidly,"" explained Stofan, the daughter of a NASA engineer who watched her first rocket launch as a four-year-old. The interplanetary endeavor has more to do with unlocking Earth's secrets than you might think. ""Being able to compare the Earth to Venus, to Mars, and studying these same processes all around the solar system -- all of a sudden you get smarter about your own planet,"" explained Stofan. ""If you're a doctor and you only have one patient, then you'd never really understand the progression of disease. You need lots of patients, and scientists learn more about the Earth by studying lots of planets."" Star Wars reality . But with so many earthly problems, does it pay to point billion dollar budgets at the skies? ""You know, we're really spending that money here on Earth,"" said Stofan. ""We get amazing technology spinoffs from the work NASA has done,"" she adds, listing everything from fuel efficient winglets on airplanes, to air traffic control systems, and equipment for measuring climate change. Science fiction becomes reality in NASA's lab, with the hovering orb seen in Star Wars -- fans will remember Luke Skywalker using it during light-saber training -- inspiring real-life gadgets on board the International Space Station. ""Think about these things you used to see on TV from science fiction, like communicators on Star Trek, well now we actually have them,"" said Stofan. ""Space exploration pushes us to say 'here's things we've just dreamed about, but we can turn that into reality.'"" Marvin the Martian . Does that mean she also believes in intelligent life? ""I think there has to be in the universe -- how easy it's going to be to find, is another question,"" said Stofan. ""Statistically every time you're looking at a star you're likely to be looking at a planetary system. Play the math game, there's billions of stars, so eventually you'll come out saying there has to be another body where life could have evolved to a fairly sophisticated level. ""Now, do I think they're visiting here and altering people's crop patterns? No. If they were smart enough to get here, we would know about it."" Women's business? As a women working at NASA, sometimes it's Stofan who feels like the alien in the room, admitting: ""I had to work four times as hard to be taken half as seriously."" ""I still go into most meetings and I will look around the room and I just suddenly register the male to female ratio -- women usually make up 10% to 20% in any room I'm in, at best."" It's a ratio fairly consistent with women working across STEM sectors (science, technology, engineering, math) in the U.S., and Stofan speaks passionately about the need for ""all hands on deck."" ""When you have problems like trying to get humans down onto the surface of Mars, if you don't have all the best minds in the world -- not just white men -- then you're not utilizing humanity the way you should."" Landing a human on Mars would inspire a new generation of scientists -- the likes of which we haven't seen since the Apollo mission 45 years ago, says Stofan. ""It's a great international human endeavor, with all the nations of the world moving out beyond Earth to explore a new planet, a new world. ""And doing it together.""

"In the shadow of the iPhone 5 reveal, Apple rolled out updates to its most enduring mobile product, the iPod, on Wednesday. They include a bigger, yet lighter and thinner, iPod Touch that mirrors the stretched-out new iPhone and a bigger screen on the tiny iPod Nano. The new Touch is 6.1 millimeters thick, making it the thinnest Touch yet, and weighs in at a dainty 3.1 ounces. Siri, Apple's voice-activated ""digital assistant,"" is also making her way to the iPod Touch, and that's not the only way Apple's premier iPod, which some already called an iPhone without the phone, is getting closer to its smartphone cousin. In addition to the same screen update, it will run Apple's latest operating system, iOS 6. It will have the same processor as the iPhone 4S and it adds a 5-megapixel rear-facing camera, featuring auto-focus and a flash. The Nano got more svelte as well. It's down to 5 millimeters thick, which makes it the thinnest iPod yet. But it's also getting a bigger, 2.5-inch touchscreen display. Favored for exercise, the Nano will come with fitness features like a built-in pedometer and support for Nike+. It also has an FM radio feature that allows users to pause and resume music. Like the iPhone 5, both new iPods will come with new, smaller inputs, but, unlike the phone, they won't come equipped with an adapter that will let users convert their old Apple cords. Along with the new iPods comes an advance in how folks will listen to them. After coining the term ""earbuds,"" Apple has moved on and showed off EarPods on Wednesday. They're round, unlike the flatter earbud, and have two grills for sound in each one. They'll come with the new Touch, Nano and iPhone 5 and be sold separately for $29. Pre-orders for the iPod Touch begin Friday. The 32GB model will sell for $299 and the 64GB model is $399. It will be available in pink, yellow, blue, black, slate and a white and silver combo. The 16GB Nano will be available in October for $149. It comes in pink, yellow, blue, green, purple, silver and slate. In recent years, iPods have been largely overshadowed as smartphones and tablets emerged as the mobile tech of choice. But they've been massive for Apple, selling more than 350 million units since being introduced in 2001, when they were credited with helping a flailing Apple launch an epic turnaround. They quietly remain relevant, developers say. ""The iPod Touch is an underappreciated part of the Apple ecosystem -- particularly for the youth and education markets,"" said Brendan Cahill, CEO of outdoor-lifestyle app NatureShare. Dave Castelnuovo, the co-creator of popular iOS game ""Pocket God,"" said Wednesday that more than 50% of the game's player base uses an iPod Touch. ""A large group of users still use the second-generation iPod Touch, which was holding back our implementation of new features,"" he said. ""I believe that these users were not upgrading the new hardware because there hasn't been a substantial iPod Touch iteration until now. With the larger screen, new design and assortment of colors, I think we're going to see a very large adoption of the new hardware.""","Apple on Wednesday unveils a new, upgraded line of iPods .

"(CNN) -- Necessity, so the saying goes, is the mother of all invention. But as history often shows adversity is often the catalyst for creativity, inspiring inventors to life-saving feats of ingenuity. Gripping story . Italian Vitale Bramani is credited with creating the world's first vulcanized rubber sole after six climbing companions perished in a snowstorm on the Italian Alps in 1935. Bramani concluded that the climber's hobnail boots were in part to blame and set about trying to improve grip and flexion of the sole. In 1936 he designed his first rubber sole and the following year, with help from tire manufacturer Pirelli, launched the first Vibram sole. An historic peak in the Vibram story was reached in July 1954 when an Italian expedition led by Ardito Desio (equipped with boot soles made by Vibram) became the first reach the summit of the world's second highest mountain K2 in Pakistan. Today, the company manufacture 40 million pairs of rubber soles annually, supplying shoe manufacturers around the world including Merrell, Timberland, Hugo Boss and Prada. Wind-up merchant . British inventor Trevor Baylis was inspired to create his wind-up radio after seeing a 1991 TV program about the spread of HIV/AIDS across the African continent. In a bid to help the transmission of health safety messages, Baylis set about building a radio that worked without electricity or batteries -- both of which are in short supply across Africa. Using a hand crank, a spring and a small dynamo, Baylis was able to produce enough energy to power a radio. The later addition of a clockwork mechanism also enabled the amount of power to be controlled. Millions of Africans have benefited from his invention, but Baylis hasn't profited financially from his brilliant brainwave. Earlier this year, the 76-year-old told a British newspaper that he was broke and could be forced to sell his London home. Space spinoff . NASA engineer Jan Zysko's was inspired to invent a compact cabin pressure monitor following the tragic death of golfer Payne Stewart in October 1999. The double U.S. Open champion was traveling on a Learjet from Orlando, Florida to Dallas, Texas when the cabin pressure gradually started to fall. Hypoxia (oxygen deprivation) incapacitated and then killed both pilots, Stewart and three other passengers before the plane, which was on autopilot, ran out of fuel and crashed. The Personal Cabin Pressure Altitude Monitor and Warning System is a hand-held device that uses sounds, vibrations and visual warnings to alert users to possible hypoxia-causing conditions before it's too late, NASA says. The invention earned Zysko NASA's Commercial and Government Invention of the Year Award in 2003. Inflating survival chances . John Hetrick was inspired to invent an airbag after crashing his car while out on a Sunday drive with his wife and seven-year-old daughter in 1952. The U.S. industrial engineer ended up in a ditch after swerving to evade a rock in the road -- his daughter only avoided hitting the dashboard thanks to the outstretched arms of Hetrick and his wife. The experience prompted Hetrick to create and patent a ""safety cushion"" device which inflated when a car comes to an abrupt halt. Although the idea failed to attract the interest of the automobile industry at the time, his work paved the way for future models. Airbags came into widespread use in cars towards the end of the 1980s and have helped save thousands of lives around the world. The first production motorcycles to be equipped with airbags started appearing in 2006. A smokin' idea . African-American inventor Garrett Morgan gave the world not one, but two lifesaving devices. Watching firefighters battling smoke in burning buildings inspired Morgan to invent the ""Safety Hood"" in 1912 which is considered a forerunner to the gas mask. The patented invention consisted of a hood and two tubes -- one long tube to breathe in cleaner air at ground level and another to exhale. In 1916, Morgan used the device to help rescue two men from a smoke-filled tunnel after an explosion at the Cleveland Waterworks. His bravery earned the inventor a gold medal from the International Association of Fire Chiefs. Seven years later, Morgan was helping save more lives, this time on the roads. After witnessing a traffic accident at an intersection he invented a new electric traffic signal. Rather than just having ""Stop"" and ""Go"" signs, Morgan's traffic light included a third position -- similar in principle to today's amber signal -- warning drivers to be cautious. General Electric bought Morgan's patent for $40,000.","Inventors often inspired to break new ground in the wake of trauma and tragedy .

"(CNN)The first major storm of 2015 is amounting to just about every kind of ornery mess by Old Man Winter. This weekend's storms will threaten havoc everywhere east of the Rockies with possible record cold, rain, snow and even tornadoes. Even West Texas was receiving heavy flurries Saturday, with up to 6 inches near Amarillo, where vehicles struggled to gain traction on ice and packed snow. In all, 55 million people in 24 states were facing winter storm watches, warnings and advisories Saturday. Freezing rain and snow is falling or is expected to descend on a vast swath from the Northern Rockies to the Great Plains toward New England. Storms are to soak the Southeast and may produce a few tornadoes and hail affecting 10 million people on the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Alabama, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said. The Northern Plains and surrounding states are expected to feel ""the coldest outbreak of arctic air"" since last winter, said another CNN meteorologist, Karen Maginnis. Wind-chill factors could become dangerous at minus-30 degrees in those plains. The National Weather Service predicted the storm ""will produce a variety of hazardous weather as it moves from the lower Mississippi Valley towards the Great Lakes this weekend."" ""A swath of wintry precipitation is forecast from the Plains to the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic on Saturday, while severe storms and heavy rain are possible in parts of the Gulf Coast into the mid-South,"" the service added. More than half the country is to be whipsawed by a front moving up from the Gulf on Saturday and then by another down from Canada on Sunday, the service said. A Saturday storm is expected to deliver rain and thunderstorms from the lower Mississippi Valley to the Northeast. That moisture is expected to translate to snow in the upper Great Lakes and the Northeast. On Sunday, that rain is projected to intensify to a heavy downfall over the Mid-Atlantic coast and southern New England, the service said. Meanwhile, a Canadian cold front will drop over the Great Plains to the Gulf of Mexico by Sunday morning, the service projected. ""The system will produce snow over the Northern High Plains/Rockies to parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley that will move southward to the Central Rockies/Plains by Saturday evening,"" the service said.

"Be it a Russian submarine or be it not, whatever has been lurking beneath the waves of the Stockholm archipelago since last week is not only drawing threats of martial force from Sweden's military, it's also getting on Lasse Schmidt's nerves. He putters around the archipelago with tourists in a small decommissioned military sub originally designed as a target for naval battle exercises. And now some of his countrymen are gunning for him. They think his submersible is what the navy detected as a potential intruder into its sovereign waters on Thursday. The military has been trawling the Baltic waters ever since. The news has his business' phone ringing, with more people booking tours. But most of the calls are annoying, he says. ""Many people believe we caused this military operation,"" Schmidt said, ""and they call to demand that we pay the bill for it."" Minesweepers . Schmidt has continued the tours despite the underwater drama, informing the navy closely about his moves, and cutting a wide berth around the battleships, minesweepers and helicopters looking for a suspicious something. The government won't say what that something is, but Sweden's press is reporting the military is looking for a submarine, maybe a Russian one. Swedish intelligence picked up a radio distress call last week -- in Russian -- which set off the defensive reconnaissance, major daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported. The transmissions were directed at the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad, 330 miles (530 kilometers) south of Stockholm, on the Baltic's southern shore, The Local reported. Red October . The search has reignited Cold War intrigue reminiscent of the blockbuster movie ""The Hunt for Red October."" A Swedish military spokeswoman warned Tuesday that they ""are prepared to use anything necessary to bring the vessel to the surface if we need to."" The same day the military called underwater tour operator Schmidt. ""They...told us to cancel the trip because of security reasons,"" he said. ""I assumed something had happened."" There were reports in the press that ships hovered for an extended period over one spot. Moscow has said it has no vessel in Swedish waters and suggested Sweden ask the Netherlands if it is one of theirs stationed nearby. The Dutch said it wasn't, according to an Agence France-Presse report. Vulnerability . Confirmation may be hard to come by, former NATO commander James Stavridis wrote in an analysis for CNN. Subs are hard to find, especially in a rocky archipelago. ""The rocky floor of an inland sea like the Baltic can mask acoustic signatures,"" he said. That blunts the ability of searchers in the air and on sea to identify an underwater object. Also, the Swedish Navy and Air Force, like many European militaries, have cut back on funding for submarine defenses since the end of the Cold War, Stavridis says. ""Anti-submarine warfare was something they would have needed against the USSR during the Cold War but less so during pre-Ukrainian crisis days with Russia,"" he says. Despite the increase in tourist interest in the undersea wonders near Stockholm, nothing has turned up during Schmidt's forays. ""I have not done any observations myself,"" he says. But others apparently have. Swedish authorities have received hundreds of reported sightings.  They say they are hopeful that at least one of them is useful.","Helicopters, battleships and minesweepers hunt for vessel .

"Newt Gingrich has absorbed a fair degree of ridicule for his campaign proposal to build an American colony on the moon. Before focusing the laughter solely on Gingrich, however, let's recall that it is the declared policy of the U.S. government to return a human being to the moon by 2020, in preparation for sending a human astronaut to Mars. If Gingrich is wrong (and he is), he's not wrong alone. As you read this, an international space station is orbiting Earth, staffed by a crew of six (currently, three Russians, two Americans and one astronaut from the European Union). Cost to date: $100 billion. American's space agency, NASA, is developing a next-generation rocket capable of lofting human crews. The rocket remains on the ground, but its development costs have soared, from a projected $28 billion to $44 billion. And the purpose of all this commotion and expense? It's very hard to answer. The useful space science these days is done by unmanned probes and satellites: the Cassini-Huygens mission that returned amazing images of Saturn and its moons; the Calipso mission to monitor the health of Earth's atmosphere; the Juno mission now en route to Jupiter. In November 2011, NASA launched its latest Mars probe, Curiosity. Curiosity should reach Mars by August. Here's the great thing about all these missions: They do not need to be engineered to zero defect, and no plans need be made to return them home. Unmanned space exploration need not worry about food and water or the effects of isolation and low-gravity on the human spirit and body. But once human beings are inserted, everything changes. Lives are put at risk. Costs soar. And for what? Most of the research purpose of sending human beings into space is to test the effects of sending human beings into space. The missions exist to test whether the missions can continue. This seems the very definition of futility. Human space flight originated as a symbolic competition during the Cold War era. The development of nuclear weapons deterred the U.S. and the Soviet Union from the hot war they might otherwise have fought. Instead, the two sides sought other ways to demonstrate their power, culminating in the race to the moon. If anyone had ever imagined that Soviet communism was technologically or economically competitive with American democracy, that illusion was retired forever when Neil Armstrong and his team touched the moon's surface and then returned safely. These human missions to space were political and military, not scientific. Their point made, their purpose ended. Meanwhile, the microelectronic and robotics revolutions of the 1970s and after enabled better science to be done without any human presence at all. Unfortunately, government agencies rarely end when their purposes do. NASA had originated to send men into space, and NASA (and its congressional supporters) were unwilling to abandon that mission merely because it no longer had any justification. New justifications had to be found! The space shuttle was built to serve a space station that was built to give the space shuttle something to do. And if you asked, ""Why?"" you got an answer like this, from space enthusiast columnist Charles Krauthammer: . ""Why do it? It's not for practicality. We didn't go to the moon to spin off cooling suits and freeze-dried fruit. Any technological return is a bonus, not a reason. We go for the wonder and glory of it. Or, to put it less grandly, for its immense possibilities. We choose to do such things, said JFK, 'not because they are easy, but because they are hard.' And when you do such magnificently hard things -- send sailing a Ferdinand Magellan or a Neil Armstrong -- you open new human possibility in ways utterly unpredictable."" With the greatest respect, ""the wonder and glory of it"" is not a very compelling answer to the question: ""What do I get for my hundred billion bucks?"" Especially since the ""wonder"" part can be better satisfied at vastly lower cost without human astronauts. The pictures from Saturn are pretty wonderful, and so will be the pictures from Jupiter, and no astronaut was needed to capture them. The hard truth to deliver to the laid-off engineers on Florida's space coast is that space exploration is another industry where automation has reduced the number of human employees needed. To propose putting 13,000 human beings on the moon is a lot like proposing to return to the days when steel mills employed tens of thousands of people. It's not a vision of the future. It's nostalgia. Join the conversation on Facebook .","David Frum: Newt Gingrich has attracted some ridicule for his plan for a moon colony .

"When it comes to new iPhones, bling is the thing. Early buyers of the iPhone 5S, which went on sale Friday morning, appear to be overwhelmingly choosing the gold-colored model over the two other color options. People trying to buy a gold phone in Apple's online store Friday saw a message stating the phone will not ship until October. By contrast, Apple said the silver and ""space gray"" models will be shipped in 7 to 10 business days. That's true for all three varieties of the phone, with 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB of storage. Anecdotal reports from lines of shoppers outside Apple stores Friday also showed big demand for the gold-hued phones, which Apple is offering for the first time. ""It's new and shiny,"" explained Georgia Tech student Chance Shafor, 22, who was the first in line Friday morning outside an Apple store at Lenox Square mall in suburban Atlanta. Shafor said he was planning to get the gold version, as were most of the other buyers interviewed outside the store by CNN. Apple has already asked its suppliers to increase production of the gold (it's really more like champagne-colored) model to meet demand, according a report in the Wall Street Journal. In China, the iPhone 5S has been available for preorder since Tuesday. Chinese news outlets reported that retailers have already sold all of the gold iPhone 5S models they had in stock. Gold is a wildly popular color in China and India, countries where Apple is hoping to capture a larger slice of the smartphone market. Unlike past models of the iconic smartphone, the iPhone 5S does not come in black or white. ""Gold is a popular choice in many markets, particularly in Asia where Apple has a stated goal of growth,"" said Massimiliano Pogliani, CEO of luxury phone company Vertu, in a recent e-mail to CNN. ""Gold is a colour that is always in demand, whether for jewelry, watches or fashion."" It's not clear whether any confused buyers think the iPhone 5S actually comes in real gold instead of its gold-colored aluminum. Deep-pocketed Apple fans can actually buy an 18k gold-plated iPhone 5 from luxury retailer Stuart Hughes for 22,000 British pounds, or about $35,000. The iPhone 5S went on sale Friday in 11 countries and territories along with the iPhone 5C, a cheaper, plastic-encased model that comes in five bright colors. The higher-end 5S has and upgraded camera, faster processor and a new fingerprint sensor for improved security. Apple could be facing tight supplies of the iPhone 5S. According to 9to5Mac and AllThingsD, sources from U.S. carriers are reporting that their stock of the phones is limited. According to All Things D, AT&T will reserve the gold and silver models for its online sales. Unlike the 5S, the cheaper iPhone 5C was available for presale online, and so far Apple, wireless carriers and other vendors still have the devices in stock in the U.S. Apple has not released any numbers on pre-orders.

"(CNN) -- Bill Cosby probably wasn't happy with Wednesday night's ""South Park."" For that matter, neither were police officers, the Washington Redskins and mindless tweeters. The long-running animated show's season finale, featuring a holiday special called ""The Washington Redskins Go F*** Yourself Holiday Special,"" managed to work in the cultural and pop-cultural obsessions of 2014 in a kitchen-sink approach. The episode ostensibly revolved around a generation gap between TV-watching ""grandpas"" (that is, anybody not glued to his or her own portable screen) and the hashtag-, YouTube-obsessed younger generation, typified by Kyle Broflovski's little brother, Ike -- but that was just an excuse to let loose on everyone. For example, there was the South Park police force, which doesn't seem to know how to handle African-Americans. Upon being notified that there's a black man in the police station, the officers' first reaction is to laugh, as if it's a setup for a joke. Then they get serious. ""Did you choke him?"" asks Sgt. Yates. ""Did you shoot him?"" The joke was later repeated. Kyle has a gentle hashtag, #savethelivingroom, hijacked by television executives, thanks to a visit by Cosby, who tells him about a TV special that's being put together.

Iggy Azalea's buttocks spoke. A Kurt Cobain hologram sang with a shotgun. Tweets filled the bottom of the screen, some wondering the point of the episode. And Cosby sang a version of ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" with Taylor Swift, offering her a drink, a reference to the Cosby rape allegations. In the end, as a commentating Cartman threatened to take over the world, the gang turned to Ike and his youthful friends, who sounded distinctly like the ""Peanuts"" crew in ""A Charlie Brown Christmas."" With the help of a new hashtag, #webelieveinyou, and the real-life YouTube star PewDiePie, everything was returned to normal by the end. Few viewers, obviously aware of ""South Park's"" bent, took offense. In fact, many approved. ""I think we take for granted how Trey Parker can jam a heap of current issues into a storyline thats a smart and funny #SouthPark episode,"" wrote Brent Veale. ""I love #southpark for ripping on the police for their mistreatment of black people,"" tweeted Dalyxman's World.

"Well, it seems the U.S. Navy finally got the memo: DON'T USE ALL CAPS! IT'S RUDE! The Navy is switching to a new messaging system that's cheaper and more efficient. And oh yeah, one that does away with a century-old practice: communications using all uppercase letters. ""Lowercase messages are here to stay; they provide a more readable format,"" a Navy news release said, citing James McCarty, the naval messaging program manager at U.S. Fleet Cyber Command. The all-caps were a vestige of a bygone era. Back in the 1850s, the teletype machines that the military used were made up of three rows of keys -- none of them lowercase letters. Word of the change went out to all naval commands in April. But it didn't reach the rest of us until the news release this week. In it, the Navy said it is ditching its in-house Defense Message System in favor of e-mail. One with a very apt acronym: NICE (Navy Interface for Command Email). The switch will save the Navy $20 million a year. And it gets them caught up with current Internet protocol. ALL CAPS READS LIKE YOU'RE BEING SHOUTED AT. Old sea dogs may feel differently. But they have a couple of months to adjust. The system won't fully be in place until next year. Once it is, naval officers will no longer feel like they're being barked at.

"A former rising star in the Republican Party, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell was red-faced and sobbing Thursday after a jury convicted him and his wife on multiple counts related to influence-peddling while he was in office. After more than a month of sometimes soul-baring testimony, the federal jury issued guilty verdicts on 11 counts against McDonnell, while clearing him on two others. His wife, Maureen, was convicted on nine while cleared on four. The charges involved gifts the couple received from a businessman, including a Rolex watch, a $15,000 check for their daughter's wedding and other items that are legal under Virginia law. Prosecutors had to prove such gifts were accepted with corrupt intent. Read the indictment . Conspiracy, wire fraud, influence peddling . Both McDonnells were convicted of conspiracy to defraud the citizens of Virginia, wire fraud, conspiracy and influence-peddling. Mrs. McDonnell also was convicted on one count of obstruction. The jury cleared them both of false statement charges, and cleared Mrs. McDonnell on one of the wire fraud counts and two of the influence-peddling counts. As the guilty verdicts came in, the former first couple wept openly in the Richmond courtroom. Judgment day . McDonnell, whose name came up as a possible running mate for GOP nominee Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election, now faces the likelihood of prison time. Sentencing was set for January 6. Assistant U.S. Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said the McDonnells ""turned public service into a money-making enterprise."" ""The former governor was elected to serve the people of Virginia, but his corrupt actions instead betrayed them,"" Caldwell said. ""Today's convictions should send a message that corruption in any form, at any level of government, will not be tolerated."" 'Difficult, disappointing day' for Virginia . U.S. Attorney Dana Boente, whose office led the prosecution, called it ""a difficult, disappointing day for the Commonwealth."" ""When public officials turn to financial gain for official actions, we have little choice but to prosecute the case,"" he said. Lawyers for the McDonnells indicated they intend to appeal. While the charges carry potential sentences of years in prison, legal experts said they don't expect the maximum penalties to be applied. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said he expected McDonnell to get about a year in prison, while his wife could get probation. Jury deliberations began Tuesday and lasted more than 17 hours over three days in the case that had all the elements of a soap opera: a broken marriage, alleged influence peddling and courtroom drama. Broken marriage . Throughout the trial, McDonnell and his wife arrived and left the courthouse separately in a display at the heart of their defense. The pair pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of fraud, making false statements and obstruction. They were indicted in January after McDonnell left office following the lone term allowed under Virginia law. Prosecutors alleged the McDonnells accepted gifts with a combined value of more than $140,000 from Jonnie Williams, a nutritional supplement executive, in exchange for promoting his company using the power and the trappings of the governor's office. The gifts included designer clothes, a Rolex watch, a golf bag, iPhones and a painting, according to the indictment and evidence presented at the trial. Read the list of gifts . Their defense? The 38-year marriage was so broken that the McDonnells barely spoke to each other, let alone conspired to peddle influence in the way alleged by the government. During the trial, the prosecution showed the couple communicated by email and vacationed together. Questionable judgment . McDonnell said he didn't commit any crime, though he acknowledged questionable judgment in accepting what he called the ""personal generosity and friendship"" of Williams. Defense lawyers argued that Maureen McDonnell, seeking emotional attachment because of her loveless marriage, developed what they described as a kind of schoolgirl crush on Williams and relished the attention and gifts from him. The question was whether she or her husband reciprocated by promoting Williams' business in government circles. Witnesses included some of the family's five grown children, former staff members of the governor and others close to the state's first family. The McDonnells tried to get their cases separated, but lost that bid.","Sentencing set for January 6 .

"(CNN) -- Most kids, and parents, think of college as the place you go to get a ""higher education."" It didn't turn out that way for at least 3,100 students at the University of North Carolina. CNN reporter Sara Ganim has been reporting the story out of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that university staff and athletic coaches encouraged student athletes to take ""fake classes"" in order to get fake grades that would allow them to keep playing sports and spend their extra time practicing instead of studying. University staff saw so-called paper classes and the artificially inflated grades they handed out ""as key to helping some student-athletes remain eligible,"" a former prosecutor wrote in an independent report documenting 18 years of such cheating. CNN reports at least four UNC employees have been fired and five have been disciplined in the scandal. ""As an athlete, we weren't really there for an education,"" Rashad McCants, the second-leading scorer on the championship University of North Carolina basketball team 10 years ago, told CNN's Carol Costello. ""You get a scholarship to the university to play basketball,"" he said. In other words, the point wasn't for him to actually learn. That's just sad. ""The university makes money off us athletes,"" McCants told Costello, ""and they give us this fake education as a distraction."" When McCants first made these remarks, university representatives tried to shoot the messenger, attacking him and his credibility. Now, an official report suggests that not only was McCants telling the truth but that at least 3,100 other students share his story. And I think it's safe to assume that while the degree of inventing classes from thin air in order to pass athletes may have reached extreme levels of immorality, if not criminality, at UNC, thousands and thousands of other student athletes have been robbed of a quality education at universities all across America because their bodies are treated as far more important than their minds. Players and their loved ones are understandably angry. In March, Northwestern University's scholarship football players won the right under the National Labor Relations Board to form a union. Players voted in April, though the results have not yet been made public. If the union vote succeeds by a majority vote, the athletes could be covered by workers' compensation, qualify for unemployment benefits and even participate in revenue sharing. As is, football players are practicing 50 to 60 hours a week — more than most full-time jobs — and risking all kinds of long-term health effects, not the least of which are head injuries. In rare cases, players who are hurt can have their scholarships revoked and lose access to whatever paltry education they were receiving in the first place. These kids, many of whom are young black men, are plainly being exploited. As the hype around college sports has intensified — especially the astronomical money to be made by universities in increasingly lucrative TV deals — universities have gained more and more from sports programs. Meanwhile, the demands on student athletes have risen as well, but the compensation and support for athletes have remained the same. College sports increasingly look just like professional sports except for one big difference: the amateurish, abusive treatment of college athletes. Not surprisingly, universities and their athletic departments oppose college players forming unions. ""I look at them as part of our family in a way,"" University of Oklahoma football coach Bob Stoops told ESPN around the time of the Northwestern vote. ""We're here to support them and help them in every way possible, and help guide them and help them get their education and develop them to be as good of athletes as they want to be."" Family, eh? That's a coded metaphor: the coach and university as the strong parents, the students as kids who should just be grateful for a roof over their heads and do whatever they're told. How does that play out in real life? One study found that 10% of University of Oklahoma athletes in sports that make revenue read below a fourth-grade level. ""College presidents have put in jeopardy the academic credibility of their universities just so we can have this entertainment industry,"" Oklahoma professor Gerald Gurney, who conducted the study, told CNN. That ""entertainment industry"" seems to be working fine for the pseudo ""parents"" who run college sports. This season, coach Stoops will be paid $5.25 million. It's not looking likely that my own daughter, who is in first grade, will eventually get a sports scholarship to college. She's still trying to figure out her left foot from her right foot. But if she gets a music scholarship or a drama scholarship or maybe some recognition for macrame skills or what have you, I fully expect that her talent will be fully drawn upon while she's at college — but also that she'll get an education. After all, most French horn players don't go on to careers in professional orchestras — they become doctors or lawyers or accountants or elementary school teachers. And for that, they need an education. The same is true of college athletes. The vast majority won't play post-college professional sports, and they need that education, not just a nominal version but a quality one, to prepare for later in life. My view is that elite college athletes should form unions. There are plenty of practical reasons why, as effective athletic employees, they should do so. But at the very least, the basic bargain of college scholarship sports — that you play on the team in exchange for an education — shouldn't be a con game, with students worked to the bone but robbed of the chance to learn. Let's hope the revelations at UNC will help start to fix this profound problem in college athletics.","Report says UNC enabled fake courses for 3,100 student athletes .

"The appearance Friday in a lower Manhattan courtroom of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law and one-time al Qaeda spokesman, to face charges of conspiracy to kill Americans underlines the perhaps surprising fact that members  of bin Laden's inner circle have been living in Iran for the past decade or so. It was Abu Ghaith's decision to leave the comparative safety of his longtime refuge in Iran for Turkey a few weeks ago that led to the chain of events that landed him in Manhattan for trial. The leading Turkish newspaper, Hurriyet, reported that Abu Ghaith was detained in the Turkish capital, Ankara, in early February. Turkey then decided to deport him to his native Kuwait via Jordan, where he was intercepted by FBI agents, who escorted him to New York. As is well known, many of bin Laden's family and members of his inner circle fled Afghanistan for Pakistan after the fall of the Taliban in the winter of 2001, but what is less well known is that some also fled to neighboring Iran. According to U.S. documents and officials, in addition to Abu Ghaith, other of bin Laden's inner circle who ended up in Iran include the formidable military commander of al Qaeda, Saif al-Adel, a former Egyptian Special Forces officer who had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, as well as Saad bin Laden, one of the al Qaeda's leader older sons who has played some kind of leadership role in the group. Saad bin Laden spent the first six months of 2002 living in Karachi in southern Pakistan. From there he helped one of his father's wives, Khairiah bin Laden, and several of his father's children to move from Pakistan to Iran. For years these bin Laden family members all lived in the Iranian capital, Tehran, under some form of house arrest. Their conditions were not unpleasant, with time for visits to swimming pools and shopping trips. Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence learned that some al Qaeda operatives were living in the northern Iranian town of Chalus, on the Caspian Sea. In 2002 a U.S. Navy SEAL operation into Chalus was planned and then rehearsed somewhere along the U.S. Gulf Coast. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Richard Myers, called off the assault because the information about where precisely the al Qaeda members were living in Chalus was not clear. A year after that operation was called off, according to US and Saudi officials, from his Iranian refuge Saif al-Adel authorized al-Qaeda's branch in Saudi Arabia to launch a series of terrorist attacks in the Saudi kingdom that began in the capital Riyadh in May 2003, a campaign that killed scores of Saudis and expatriates. Bergen: Trying bin Laden's son-in-law in New York makes sense . On the face of it, the fact that a number of al Qaeda leaders and operatives and bin Laden family members found shelter in Iran is puzzling, as the Shia theocrats in the Iranian regime are hostile to the Sunni ultra zealots in al Qaeda, and vice versa. For al Qaeda's operatives, life in Iran was more secure than for many of their colleagues in Pakistan who risked capture by Pakistani forces working with the CIA or death by CIA drones. The Iranian regime likely saw the al Qaeda operatives as useful bargaining chips with the United States in the event of some kind of peace negotiations with the Americans. That peace deal, of course, never happened. Of course, for Iran the adage, ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"" may have also come into play, although there doesn't seem to be evidence that Iran and al Qaeda have ever cooperated on a specific operation. That said, the 9/11 Commission found that of the 19 hijackers, ""8 to 10 of the 14 Saudi ""muscle"" operatives traveled into or out of Iran between October 2000 and February 2001."" Whether this was with any degree of Iranian complicity is still an open question. The fact that leading members of al Qaeda were based in Iran from 2002 on was known to the U.S. government at the time. (In fact, in early 2003 counterterrorism officials briefed me about this development). There is something of an irony here. This was during the same time period in which senior administration officials under President George W. Bush were citing the alleged presence of al Qaeda members in Baghdad and a supposedly burgeoning alliance between al Qaeda and Iraq's leader Saddam Hussein as a key reason to go to war against Saddam, Iran's bitter enemy. Five years after the invasion of Iraq, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded, as had every other official investigation of the matter, that in fact there was no ""cooperative relationship"" between Saddam and al Qaeda. In late 2008 al Qaeda operatives kidnapped Heshmatollah Attarzadeh-Niyaki, an Iranian diplomat, in the western Pakistan city of Peshawar. After holding the diplomat for over a year the militants quietly released him back to Iran in the spring of 2010. This was part of a deal that allowed some of bin Laden's family and al Qaeda members living under house arrest in Iran to depart, according to a Pakistani official familiar with the deal. This deal did not, however, mean that relations between the Iranians and al Qaeda suddenly became all hunky dory. Documents recovered at bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, following the SEAL raid there on May 1, 2011, and since publicly released portray a rather tense relationship between al Qaeda and the Iranian authorities. In a letter that bin Laden wrote just five days before he died he described a document from his son Saad who had lived in Iran for years ""which exposes the truth of the Iranian regime."" What bin Laden meant precisely by this is not clear, but taken together with some of the other letters that were found in his Abbottabad compound it is obvious that bin Laden and his men were quite distrustful of the Iranian regime. A letter to bin Laden from his chief of staff dated 11 June 2009 has a detailed account about a group of ""mid level"" al Qaeda members who the Iranians had recently released, including three Egyptians, a Yemeni, a Iraqi and a Libyan. Bin Laden's chief of staff attributed these releases to al Qaeda's kidnapping of the Iranian diplomat in Peshawar, but added that the Iranians ""don't want to show that they are negotiating with us or reacting to our pressure. ... We ask God to repel their evil."" In another undated letter from bin Laden to his chief off staff al Qaeda's leader gave a set of detailed instructions about how best to handle his family members living in Iran once they were released. Bin Laden urged extreme caution ""since the Iranians are not to be trusted."" Among another precautions, he wrote that his family members ""should be warned about the importance of getting rid of everything they received from Iran like baggage or anything even as small as a needle, as there are eavesdropping chips that have been developed to be so small they can be put inside a medical syringe."" In this letter bin Laden mentioned by name a number of his children living in Iran including his sons Ladin, Uthman and Muhammad and his daughter Fatima, who is married to Sulaiman Abu Ghaith who now sits in a Manhattan jail. In October the U.S. Treasury named as terrorists six al Qaeda members living in Iran who it said are funding terrorist activities in Pakistan and sending fighters and money to Syria to fight the Assad regime there. Abu Ghaith didn't play an operational role in al Qaeda -- a fact that was underlined in the charges filed against him last week in Manhattan that revolve around his role as a propagandist for the group. So it is the precise nature of al Qaeda's arrangements in Iran and the kind of activities outlined in the recent Treasury designation of the half-dozen al Qaeda members living in Iran that are likely to be of most interest to American investigators. Given the fact that since 9/11, New York courts have convicted at a rate of 100% in cases that involve members of al Qaeda and associated groups, Abu Ghaith could doubtless cut an attractive plea deal for himself if he gives a full accounting of al Qaeda's murky decade in Iran.","Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, now in custody, had spent time in Iran .

"Los Angeles (CNN)The last hand in the ""two thumbs up"" film critic team, Roger Ebert, died Thursday, two days after revealing cancer returned to his body. Ebert and Gene Siskel co-hosted the iconic review show ""Siskel and Ebert At The Movies"" until Siskel's death in 1999 after a battle with a brain tumor. The Chicago Sun-Times, the base of operations for Ebert's syndicated reviews, announced his death at age 70.""We were getting ready to go home today for hospice care, when he looked at us, smiled, and passed away. No struggle, no pain, just a quiet, dignified transition,"" his wife, Chaz Ebert, said in a statement Thursday. ""I'll see you at the movies,"" were the last words Ebert wrote to his readers. They were published in an essay titled ""Leave of Presence"" on his blog Tuesday, in which he explained he was planning to slow down and reduce the number of movie reviews he wrote. ""My intent is to continue to write selected reviews but to leave the rest to a talented team of writers handpicked and greatly admired by me,"" Ebert wrote. ""What's more, I'll be able at last to do what I've always fantasized about doing: reviewing only the movies I want to review."" Ebert had already lost his voice and much of his jaw after battling thyroid and salivary gland cancer. He suffered a hip fracture in December, and it recently led to the revelations about cancer, he said. Ebert started as the Sun-Times film critic on April 3, 1967, writing about 200 reviews each of those 46 years, he said. The last year however, was his most prolific. ""Last year, I wrote the most of my career, including 306 movie reviews, a blog post or two a week, and assorted other articles,"" he said. ""I must slow down now, which is why I'm taking what I like to call 'a leave of presence.'"" Ebert: The critical critic with an open mind . Ebert, who won a Pulitzer Prize for film criticism in 1975, had a way with words and a sharp wit that is not easily matched. -- About Rob Schneider's ""Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo"" in 2005: ""If he's going to persist in making bad movies, he's going to -- have to grow accustomed to reading bad reviews."" -- Concerning Schneider's reaction to another critic who panned the film: ""But Schneider is correct, and Patrick Goldstein has not yet won a Pulitzer Prize. Therefore, Goldstein is not qualified to complain that Columbia financed ""Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo"" while passing on the opportunity to participate in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Ray,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""Sideways"" and ""Finding Neverland."" As chance would have it, I have won the Pulitzer Prize, and so I am qualified. Speaking in my official capacity as a Pulitzer Prize winner, Mr. Schneider, your movie sucks."" Two years later, flowers showed up at Ebert's door with a card, signed ""Your Least Favorite Movie Star, Rob Schneider."" ""The bouquet didn't change my opinion of his movie, but I don't think he intended that,"" Ebert wrote.  ""It was a way of stepping back. It was a reminder that in the great scheme of things, a review doesn't mean very much.  Sometimes when I write a negative review, people will say, 'I'll bet you can't wait to hammer his next film.' Not true. I would far rather praise the next film to show that I maintained an open mind."" -- A good example of Ebert's willingness to keep an open mind comes from his review of Tom Green's 2001 comedy ""Freddy Got Fingered"" of which he wrote one of his most scathing reviews: . ""This movie doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels."" But after watching Green in ""Stealing Harvard"" a year later, Ebert revisited the film that he had awarded a rare zero stars: . ""But the thing is, I remember 'Freddy Got Fingered' more than a year later. I refer to it sometimes. It is a milestone. And for all its sins, it was at least an ambitious movie, a go-for-broke attempt to accomplish something. It failed, but it has not left me convinced that Tom Green doesn't have good work in him. Anyone with his nerve and total lack of taste is sooner or later going to make a movie worth seeing."" -- Reviewing ""Crocodile Dundee II"": ""I've seen audits that were more thrilling."" -- Giving no love to ""Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith"": ""To say that George Lucas cannot write a love scene is an understatement; greeting cards have expressed more passion."" Ebert: The film philosopher . -- ""Every great film should seem new every time you see it."" -- ""No good movie is too long and no bad movie is short enough."" -- ""If you have to ask what it symbolizes, it didn't."" -- ""If a movie isn't a hit right out of the gate, they drop it. Which means that the whole mainstream Hollywood product has been skewed toward violence and vulgar teen comedy."" -- ""I am utterly bored by celebrity interviews. Most celebrities are devoid of interest."" Ebert: Remembered . --Wife Chaz Ebert: ""I am devastated by the loss of my love, Roger -- my husband, my friend, my confidante and oh-so-brilliant partner of over 20 years. He fought a courageous fight. I've lost the love of my life and the world has lost a visionary and a creative and generous spirit who touched so many people all over the world. We had a lovely, lovely life together, more beautiful and epic than a movie. It had its highs and the lows, but was always experienced with good humor, grace and a deep abiding love for each other. ""Roger was a beloved husband, stepfather to Sonia and Jay, and grandfather to Raven, Emil, Mark and Joseph. Just yesterday he was saying how his grandchildren were 'the best things in my life.' He was happy and radiating satisfaction over the outpouring of responses to his blog about his 46th year as a film critic. But he was also getting tired of his fight with cancer, and said if this takes him, he has lived a great and full life."" -- American Film Institute president and CEO Bob Gazzale: ""Roger Ebert championed the art of the moving image and by the courage of his personal example demonstrated how much movies matter. Ebert chaired the AFI AWARDS jury of critics, filmmakers and scholars who selected the year's 10 best films in 2004. He held the gavel that day with the same enthusiasm for excellence that made his voice a force in American popular culture."" -- Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel: ""Our whole city learned with sadness today of the passing of Roger Ebert, whose name was synonymous with two things: the movies and Chicago. In a Pulitzer Prize winning career that spanned more than four decades, thousands of reviews and countless acts of generosity to others, Roger championed Chicago as a center for filmmaking and critiques. With a knowledge of his subject as deep as his love for his wife Chaz, Roger Ebert will be remembered for the strength of his work, respected for his courage in the face of illness, and revered for his contribution to filmmaking and to our city. The final reel of his life may have run through to the end, but his memory will never fade."" -- Sun-Times Media Editor in Chief Jim Kirk: ""The long relationship between Roger and his Sun-Times family speaks volumes about Roger's commitment to his craft and to his fans around the world. Roger's reviews were highly anticipated by readers and the film community. Film commentary was only one of several gifts. He was a reporter first, in every aspect of his craft. He could write as eloquently about world affairs as he could on the upcoming blockbuster. Roger will be missed not only by the Sun-Times family, but by the journalism and film communities. Our thoughts are with Roger's wife, Chaz, and their family during this time.""","""No struggle, no pain, just a quiet, dignified transition,"" his wife says .

"Rick Santorum's decision to drop out of the Republican presidential race came after he spent the holiday weekend evaluating the race with his family, who were grappling with the latest hospitalization of his 3-year-old daughter Bella. Santorum's path to the nomination hinged on three puzzle pieces falling neatly in place, multiple sources close to the campaign told CNN, a prospect that grew dimmer with each passing day. The campaign, eagerly looking ahead to a slew of conservative leaning states that vote in May, had hoped that Texas would adjust its proportional primary rules and award its treasure trove of 155 delegates on a winner-take-all basis -- but Texas Republicans dismissed the idea. Santorum was also hoping that Gingrich, who has also been competing for the same conservative anti-Romney voters, would drop out of the race, something the former House Speaker shows no signs of doing. Finally, the campaign understood that a victory in Santorum's home state of Pennsylvania on April 24 was crucial. Romney's poll numbers have lately creeped up in Pennsylvania and his campaign was in the process of unleashing a more than $2 million negative ad blitz against Santorum across the state, but Santorum aides said they remained confident that they would pull out a win on their home turf. His campaign reported it was nearly $1 million in debt last month and would have been forced to drain its campaign account to compete with Romney and his allies on the costly Pennsylvania airwaves, another factor in Santorum's decision. Where do religious conservatives go? ""The Romney team was putting a lot of money out there,"" said one Santorum adviser who did not want to be named discussing internal decision-making. ""The budget was a factor."" Despite trailing in the delegate count, Santorum vowed as recently as last week to remain in the race until one candidate reached the 1,144 delegates needed to capture the nomination. However, during a conference call with his wife, Karen, campaign manager and staff before his announcement on Tuesday, Santorum said the decision was based on personal and political factors, according to a Santorum source. A campaign adviser also said the financial state of the campaign probably played a role in the conclusion. ""We made a decision over the weekend that while this presidential race for us is over for me and we will suspend our campaign effective today, we are not done fighting,"" Santorum said during his speech in Gettysburg on Tuesday. ""We will continue to fight for those voices for those Americans who stood up and gave us that air under our wings."" He also acknowledged the decision was not entirely political, saying the past weekend was a ""time of prayer and thought"" as he and his family cared for his daughter Isabella, the youngest of Santorum's seven children, who suffers from Trisomy 18, a chromosomal condition. Santorum's organization announced they were halting campaign events on Friday because the candidate's three-year-old daughter Bella was admitted to the hospital. Bella, the youngest of Santorum's seven children, suffers from a rare chromosomal disorder called Trisomy 18, which causes severe medical and developmental problems. Santorum's departure leaves rival Mitt Romney with a firm grasp on the nomination but also deep wounds left to heal within the GOP. Priebus: ""Time heals some wounds"" Santorum spoke to Romney before Tuesday's speech, according to a Republican source. But Santorum aide Hogan Gidley told CNN an endorsement of the former Massachusetts governor ""is not a inevitability."" Gidley said Santorum and Romney are attempting to schedule a meeting to discuss an endorsement and that the latter would like it to occur ""sooner rather than later."" Santorum entered the race with a voting record in the House and Senate of a staunch social conservative and presented himself on the campaign trail as the alternative to more moderate candidates, who he said had compromised their ideals for political expediency. More recently, he elevated his fire directly at Romney, labeling him a flip-flopper on conservative issues including abortion rights, cap and trade and government mandated health care. He also repeatedly accused the former executive of failing to tell the truth. ""For somebody who is maybe the weakest candidate we've every had on the pro-life issue to attack the leader of the pro-life cause is absurd,"" Santorum said at a forum in Troy, Michigan on February 25. ""He glosses over and doesn't even tell the truth....Here is a guy who is the ultimate flip-flopper running for president, and he's attacking me for not being principled?  That doesn't wash."" Santorum officially announced his candidacy on June 6, 2011, and quickly began airing radio ads in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, the first three states to vote. Soon after his official announcement, he told CNN that his bid would be based on a consistent conservative record. ""I think I stand out because I have been a consistent conservative, someone who has been a leader, someone who's had the courage to lead on a variety of hot-button topics before they were popular, like entitlement reform. I've been a leader on that,"" he said. In August, when his candidacy was barely making waves in key early voting states, Santorum maintained his effort would take a long view of the race, saying at a rally, ""This is the little-engine-that-could campaign."" He was eclipsed first by Michele Bachmann's entry in the race, then Rick Perry's. When those two faltered, Herman Cain became the conservative favorite. As Cain was faltering amid accusations of sexual harrassment, Newt Gingrich was the last conservative to slingshot past Santorum, taking a lead over Romney in polls in November and December. At GOP presidential debates throughout the fall, Santorum was mostly marginalized as the most questions went to the top-tier candidates. In the months leading up to Iowa's caucuses, Santorum became the first GOP presidential candidate to visit all of Iowa's 99 counties, often sporting what became his signature look (and the butt of jokes): a sweater vest bearing his campaign's logo. Despite all that time in Iowa, Santorum didn't see substantial traction in polls until January as Gingrich withered in the heat of negative ads from Romney's campaign and a super PAC that supports him. And on election night in Iowa, it looked like Santorum had narrowly missed his first surprise victory in the race when initial counts showed he had come eight votes short of beating Romney. The narrow miss was enough to energize conservatives to contribute to the cause and give Santorum a spike in fundraising. And his conservative rivals began to fall. Bachmann dropped out of the race the day after Iowa. Two weeks later, the certified vote in Iowa showed that Santorum had actually won there and Perry dropped out of the race later that same day. Gingrich then won in South Carolina and Romney won in Florida and Nevada, states that Santorum largely ignored to concentrate on more conservative voters down the road. That strategy paid off when he stunned Romney by sweeping Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri all on the same day and changed the trajectory of the race. Romney, who had begun to take on the air of the Republican nominee by focusing on President Barack Obama rather than Republican rivals, had to turn his focus back toward his challenger and built up a nearly 400-delegate lead in the race to the 1,144 needed to clinch the nomination. Zelizer: The real race is now on . Despite increasingly long odds, Santorum maintained throughout the last weeks of March that he would stay in the race, citing flawed delegate math and upcoming contests that looked to be in his favor. ""Our delegate calculation has Gov. Romney far below 50%,"" Santorum said on March 19 on CBS. ""We think there's a lot of primaries coming up, including Pennsylvania my home state, where we can make some big delegates. Texas will be another great state for us. We feel very good that we're going to continue to win and do well."" A senior Santorum source said that Bella's hospitalization was a major factor in the decision to bow out. ""When you have enough time with your adrenaline down, you start to think about what's really important,"" the source told CNN. Sitting in the hospital with his daughter for the second time during this campaign put that in perspective for Santorum, the source said.","Santorum made his decision after evaluating the race with his family .
Campaign hoped that Texas would become a winner-take-all state .
Santorum also wanted Gingrich out of race, but he shows no sign of quitting .
Financial issues also played a role in Santorum's decision ."
"Even if you don't know his songs by name, chances are you've partied to Pitbull. With his No. 1 hit ""Give Me Everything"" and collaborations with stars like Jennifer Lopez, Usher, Christina Aguilera, Chris Brown, Kesha and Shakira, the Cuban-American rapper born Armando Christian Perez is riding high with his career. But Pitbull's monster success hasn't gone to his head. As he recently told Nischelle Turner on ""CNN Spotlight"": He just wants to bring joy to his fans. ""When you make this music that makes everybody feel good, that is the goal,"" he said. ""When you come and see me ... I want you to escape. No mortgage. No bills. No baby mama drama. No child support. No economy messed up. No war. No terrorists. Just come here and lose your mind and enjoy."" But what makes Pitbull feel good? Snagging high-profile gigs like opening the World Cup or hosting the American Music Awards keeps him busy, but here are five things you may not know about Mr. Worldwide: . 1. He plays hard, and he works hard. Banish the thought that Pitbull is just a musician. Behind the scenes, he is also a savvy businessman who, in addition to a line of fragrances for men and women and a TV development company, also has partnerships with Kodak, Voli Vodka and Bud Light. When asked for his best investment tips, Pitbull said: ""Don't be afraid to lose. Listen. And always invest in yourself."" With almost 17 million Twitter followers and millions of downloads of his music, he is a pop culture force to be reckoned with. ""Pitbull is only going to get bigger,"" Rolling Stone journalist Simon Vozick-Levinson said. ""He's someone who's not going to stop until he takes over the entire world."" ""There's nothing owed to you in life,"" Pitbull said. ""Those who make it work hard for it."" 2. His stage name has meaning. According to the biography ""Pitbull: Mr. Worldwide,"" the rapper had a reason for wanting to be known after a particular breed of dog. ""(Pitbulls) bite to lock,"" the book quotes him as saying. ""The dog is too stupid to lose. And they're outlawed in Dade County (Florida). They're basically everything that I am. It's been a constant fight."" He told CNN that he admires the tenacity of the breed. ""I like the hunt; I like when people say you can't, you won't, you never will,"" Pitbull said. ""Those kind of things turn me on."" It was around the release of his song ""I Know You Want Me"" that Pitbull began to expand his territory. He went from representing Miami as Mr. 305 (for the city's area code) to the man we've now come to know as Mr. Worldwide. ""If you don't know where you're from, you don't know where you're going,"" Pitbull said. ""Believe me, I know where I'm from. I love it. I wear it on my chest. Everywhere I go everybody knows Mr. 305, Mr. Dade County, Miami boy representing. When I say Mr. Worldwide, it's because we're all around the world. Now, we've got to think of another name like Mr. Another Planet or something."" Video: Pitbull's favorite Cuban food . 3. His clothing does, too. Fans can't seem to get enough of Pitbull the sharp-dressed man (think tailored suits, not jeans and baseball caps), but to Pitbull, it's more than just a fashion statement. ""What I've shown is evolution through the music business,"" he said. ""When people ask, 'How come you don't do music for the streets no more?' ""Man, I made music to get out the streets, not to stay in the streets. 'How come you be putting on these suits now?' It shows maturity; it shows growth; it shows evolution. This is what I want to teach y'all; this is what this music's about. This is what this journey is about."" ""He's the truth,"" Usher said. ""He's consistent. He constantly is a gentleman. There's something about a man who at every turn shows up with a suit on -- and will sweat for two hours in it. He's committed, man."" 4. He speaks his mind, whether you like it or not. What is celebrity status if it doesn't include a few beefs here and there? Pitbull has had his share of run-ins with other stars including Lindsay Lohan, who lost a defamation lawsuit against him after he rapped in a song, ""I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan"" in reference to her highly publicized arrests. Rapper Lil Wayne also ran afoul of Pitbull after ranting against his beloved Miami Heat. Pitbull went so far as to record a ""diss track"" called ""Welcome to Dade County."" 5. He is inspiring the next generation to be successful like him. As Lil Wayne learned the hard way, Pitbull takes both Miami and sports seriously. But beyond recording music about it, he is using that passion to help shape the future. He helped create the Sports Leadership and Management Academy, aka SLAM, a charter school in Miami with a sports-based curriculum. ""The reason it's so special is cause (the kids) are me,"" Pitbull said. ""I can say (to them), 'I can tell you what's going on in your house right now. I know. I feel you. I've been there.' ... If we catch them at that little age, mold their minds, teach them what it is to be motivated, self-inspire, believe in themselves because coming from the neighborhood we came from no one believed in us ... this is changing the world little by little.""","Pitbull is an accomplished businessman .

"(CNN)On Sunday the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the Green Bay Packers will face off in the NFC Championship Game. For the Seahawks, winning would give them the chance to go back to the Super Bowl and perhaps net another Vince Lombardi Trophy. High stakes to be sure, but officials in one Seattle suburb have taken pre-game rivalry to the next level by banning ""possession of and/or consumption of cheese or cheese flavored products."" For those not making the connection between cheese and this NFL matchup, Douglas Schulze, the city manager of Bainbridge Island, Washington, spells it out in his executive order. ""On Sunday, January 18, 2015, the Seattle Seahawks opponent in the NFC Championship game will be the Green Bay Packers, aka Cheeseheads,"" the order states. ""Fans of the Green Bay Packers are frequently seen wearing obnoxious wedge-shaped foam hats painted yellow."" It is ""due to this relationship"" between Packers fans and cheese that the ban was enacted. The ban only applies to employees at city hall and only on Friday, but Schulze has a plan for anyone who defies the ban and comes, pun intended, packing. ""I'm going to arrive early, and we'll have some type of cheese grater or shredder available so if anybody brings in cheeses or cheese products, we'll have to dispose of them,"" Schulze told CNN affiliate KOMO. The ban may only impact a fraction of the town's 23,000 residents, but it caught the attention of Green Bay fans almost 2,000 miles away. ""Insane,"" ""ridiculous"" and ""demonic"" were just a few of the adjectives thrown out by distraught Cheeseheads to CNN affiliate WDJT. ""They should never ban cheese,"" said one man ""We are going to own Seattle."" Some proposed bans of their own, such as a boycott of Seattle-based Starbucks. But one Milwaukee radio station did one better. 94.5 the Lake will ""Say No To Seattle."" That means no songs from Nirvana, Pearl Jam or Heart before the big game. The preparations aren't all about bans either. In the Bainbridge Island executive order, Schulze also calls for a ""Blue Friday"" celebration for all local government employees, who are encouraged to wear ""Seahawks jerseys, logo gear, team colors."" But lest anyone get carried away, Schulze made it clear, in an interview with KOMO, to leave the Cheetos and Cheez-whiz at home. And don't even think about sneaking in some on a party tray. But cheese lovers needing a fix may have one remaining option: Schulze said ""he has yet to scour the vending machines.""","Cheese is banned in Bainbridge Island, Washington, before Sunday's NFC Championship Game .

"Hillary Clinton finds herself in an impossible position. She's seriously considering what some believe is an inevitable second run for the presidency. But the four years she spent as Barack Obama's secretary of state look a lot different today than when she left the administration more than a year ago. The surprise reset of Russian relations went awry over Ukraine and the promise of the  Arab Spring collapsed amid worsening civil war in Syria and the brutal advances of the Islamic State in Iraq. Baghdad lapsed into political chaos, violence flared anew in Libya,  Benghazi remains under scrutiny, and the perennially tense situation between Israel and Hamas exploded in violence again in Gaza. Much of this reached crisis stage after she left the State Department, but Clinton is on the hook for a lot of Obama's foreign policy legacy. And many experts say she needs to distance herself from it before launching any campaign for the White House. But the strategy for that is complex and risky. Not only does it open Clinton up to attacks from Republicans like GOP uber-strategist Karl Rove, who wrote on Thursday that breaking with Obama ""may not work so well"" for her. But it also runs counter to what she, her advisers and supporters have been doing for the past two months. Clinton recently published ""Hard Choices,"" a 656-page volume about her experiences as America's top diplomat that is noticeably thin on disagreements with Obama. Yes, Clinton writes about conflicting opinions over arming Syrian rebels and some smaller differences on drones. But she largely balked at her chance in the book to break with Obama. It was a perfect opportunity to do so. If anything, Clinton's aides and outside supporters responded to Republican criticism of her record at the State Department and drew her closer to her boss's foreign policy. Correct the Record, an outside rapid response and communications group, began tweeting and writing about Clinton's accomplishments on a daily basis. It touted her book as a success, highlighted her work in the Middle East and heralded Clinton's ""pivot to Asia."" At the same time, Clinton and her advisers retooled her promotional bio and worked out an answer for the question, ""What did you accomplish as secretary of state?"" The world blew up during the book tour . Instead of stumbling on the question -- something Clinton did more than once during the book tour -- she began to breeze through it. She highlighted a checklist of accomplishments and victories shared with Obama. ""Thanks in large measure to Hillary's leadership, people were finally able to say: 'America's back,'"" reads her new promotional bio. But a cascading series of world events that seemed to coincide with the book tour or the buzz around it challenged America's interests abroad in a big way and tested its influence. New and more difficult questions emerged. Obama's foreign policy was under fire on a number of fronts. Acutely aware of the changing narrative, Clinton has been trying to selectively distance herself from some of the messy foreign developments. But this week, she put it into clearer political context. In an interview with The Atlantic, Clinton trashed the Obama mantra that reflects his cautious approach to foreign policy: ""Don't do stupid stuff."" She said that was ""not an organizing principle"" and labeled the President's decisions in Syria, with which she has long disagreed, a ""failure."" 'Hugging it out': Clinton calls Obama to calm tensions . This all appeared to cause more harm than good. David Axelord, Obama's former top adviser who now acts as his biggest defender outside the White House, took her to task with a tweet, referencing her 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq War. And liberals in her party spoke up about the quickness with which she broke with Obama in favor of hawkish rhetoric. Clinton reached out to Obama this week to assure him that her comments did not represent an attack on his policies or his leadership. People close to Clinton argue she used the interview to only articulate what she wrote in the book about Syria. On the festering civil war, Clinton writes that ""the President's inclination was to stay the present course and not take the significant further step of arming rebels,"" while hers was to arm the rebels. ""No one likes to lose a debate, including me. But this was the President's call and I respected his deliberations and decision,"" she writes. As secretary of state, though, Clinton publicly expressed doubt with arming the rebels. ""What are we going to arm them with and against what,"" Clinton told CBS in February 2012. ""You are not going to bring tanks over the borders of Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan — that's not going to happen. So maybe at the best you can smuggle in, you know, automatic weapons."" Few hints of disagreement . But there was little indication that she disagreed with Obama on other big issues during her time in his Cabinet, including the pivot to Asia, a cease-fire between Israel and Gaza the last time around, and working to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions. Opinion: Clinton pummels Obama foreign policy . One former Clinton aide said what Clinton told The Atlantic reflected what she wrote in the book and that there's no indication she's being a ""Monday morning quarterback."" ""I think it is wrong to assume that the fact things are going to sh** abroad, that is why she is coming out so forcefully against him,"" said a former Clinton campaign aide. ""The timing of this book, the timing of these interviews is coincidental."" Republicans see Clinton distancing herself from Obama as a boon for them. Not only might it reinforce their anti-Obama efforts, but it enables them to amplify their claims that Clinton's just expedient. ""She is cold and calculating and a hyper-positioning politician,"" said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist. Opinion: Clinton,  Obama both wrong . He was excited about the prospect of the GOP exploiting Clinton's ""voluminous"" and ""overwhelming"" record of working with Obama. The Republican National Committee also sees an opening. ""Hillary Clinton spent four years executing Barack Obama's foreign policy and in year five of Obama's term, it's ridiculous for Hillary to try to swindle voters into thinking what's happening around the world isn't a product of Obama-Hillary diplomacy,"" said Kirsten Kurkowski, spokeswoman for the RNC. Republicans are trying to exploit Clinton's attempts to distance herself from the ""Obama Doctrine."" ""Moving away from Mr. Obama may look good on paper, but it may not work so well,"" Rove wrote in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal. ""For one thing, Mrs. Clinton cannot point to any notable successes during her State Department tenure."" Former Vice President Dick Cheney also got in on it as well. ""I don't think it's a slam dunk for her by any means,"" he told conservative Hugh Hewitt's radio show on Wednesday.","Tied to Obama's foreign policy, Clinton must find the right way to create some distance .
Trying to break with Obama, Clinton created an uproar from his loyalists and liberals .
Clinton missed an opportunity in her memoir to create some distance from Obama .
Clinton is tied to much of Obama's foreign policy from her time as secretary of state ."
"Those two New York buildings where eight people died in an explosion were served by a very old gas main -- 127 years old to be exact. It's the latest incident in what experts warn is a dangerous trend plaguing the nation's oldest cities: natural gas leaks and aging infrastructure. ""Gas explosions are happening way too frequently,"" said Mark McDonald, president of Boston-based NatGas Consulting and the New England Gas Workers Association. ""It's an epidemic."" The cause of Wednesday's explosion in East Harlem, which injured dozens and destroyed the five-story buildings, has not been determined officially. But tests taken of the soil in the area in the hours after the explosion found natural gas at levels as high as 20% when none should have been present, federal investigators said. ""It almost confirms you had a gas leak out there, and the building exploded,"" McDonald told CNN. ""That means we can be 99% sure this was caused by a gas explosion."" Robert Sumwalt of the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the blast, said the readings indicated natural gas might have triggered the explosion that shook the bustling neighborhood. The soil readings ""further lead to the hypothesis that this may well have been a natural gas leak,"" Sumwalt told reporters. ""We would expect to find zero concentration of natural gas in the soil, so it would indicate that at least somehow or another natural gas did work its way into the ground."" Some urban gas lines: Antiquated and hard to reach . The blast comes as many U.S. utilities struggle to maintain or replace antiquated, hard-to-reach and leaky gas mains in older urban areas, according to experts. The most vulnerable mains are made of cast iron or steel. A day before the explosion, the New York-based Center for an Urban Future said in a report that New York's aging infrastructure ""could wreak havoc on the city's economy and quality of life."" An estimated $47.3 billion would have to be devoted for repairs to maintain safety. ""The average age of New York City's 6,400 miles of sewage mains is approximately 84 years, for example,"" wrote the report's author, Adam Forman. ""Its 6,800 miles of water mains are approximately 69 years old, and its 6,300 miles of gas mains are 56 years old."" Leaks cause the city's top utility company, Con Ed, to lose more than 2% of the gas it delivers to customers each year, according to the report. Additionally, 60% of New York gas mains are made of unprotected steel or cast iron, which are prone to leaks and no longer used by main manufacturers. Con Edison manages one of the oldest gas distribution networks in the country, the report said. The utility's 2,234 miles of gas mains, which serve 833,000 customers in the Bronx, Manhattan and northern Queens, are 53 years old on average. Citing the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the report said Con Edison experienced 83 leaks for every 100 miles of main in 2012. Corrosion was responsible for 427 of those leaks. In East Harlem, the gas pipe serving the collapsed buildings included a cast iron section dating from 1887, city officials said. A cold and dangerous trap . ""Cast iron and frost don't mix well,"" McDonald said. Con Edison officials said the utility received a call reporting a gas leak around 9:13 a.m. Wednesday from a resident at one of the newer buildings on Park Avenue. The utility dispatched a truck two minutes later, but it arrived after the explosion. The caller, as well as other residents on the block, reported smelling gas the night before but did not call the utility at the time. McDonald and other experts said underground pipes are a major source of gas leaks, with the escaping gas typically traveling through the soil and dissipating into the air. During winter, however, soil is hardened by frost, which traps the gas and causes it to travel sideways. With warmer weather, the frost thaws and the soil contracts. Earth movements caused by construction work or other environmental factors can also cause pipes to crack. ""That expansion and contraction can heave the cast iron pipes up, down, left, right,"" McDonald said. ""Being old doesn't help, obviously. But cast iron is a very fragile material when you bend it or displace it... If a leaky main is close to a building, about 4 or 5 feet away, the gas can work its way into a building."" The future is in plastic . Con Edison and other utilities around the nation have stepped up efforts to replace cast iron pipelines with plastic ones. The utility is replacing an average of 65 miles of gas mains each year, for the next three years, at a cost of approximately $110 million, Con Ed spokesman Bob McGee said. In addition, the company spends about $500 million a year maintaining and upgrading the natural gas infrastructure. ""Age alone does not tell you about the condition of the pipe,"" McGee said in a statement. ""Cast iron pipes can be used for hundreds of years if the underpinning and the environment around the pipes is sound."" Still, experts said, the old iron pipes beneath many U.S. cities are too vulnerable. ""Gas companies have been very lucky over the years to not have this happen more,"" Bob Ackley, a natural gas consultant who runs Massachusetts-based Gas Safety USA, said of the East Harlem explosion. ""For every gas company across the northern part of this country, whether it's Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland or Buffalo ... this is a critical time. They have hundreds of broken mains going on around the country now, and they are lucky to catch most."" The aging infrastructure of cities such as New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago make them especially susceptible to leaks and explosions, experts said. In January, a study published by researchers at Duke University and Boston University detected 5,893 leaks of methane, the main component of natural gas, rising from the streets of Washington.  At 12 of the tested locations, the study found ""potentially explosive"" concentrations of underground methane  -- about 10 times greater than the threshold at which explosions can occur. ""I see the industry slipping in my opinion in terms of vigilance and protecting the public,"" McDonald said. ""It comes down to what can we cut, what can we avoid doing?"" The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that more than 30,000 miles of cast iron pipe are still being used to deliver gas throughout the nation. The highest percentage of cast-iron mains are in Philadelphia, Washington, Boston and New York City. ""Let's hope gas operators get through this winter without another incident,"" Ackley said. ""Con Ed and other national gas companies are really nervous right now.""","Buildings where eight in East Harlem died were served by a 127-year-old gas main .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- New York authorities indicted seven people accused of running a prostitution ring on the Web site Craigslist, the state's attorney general announced Wednesday. Craigslist is replacing its ""erotic services"" listings with ads that are screened by the site's employees. Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office said the group ran a 24-hour prostitution ring called Room Service Entertainment from Craigslist's erotic services section from June 2007 to December 2008. The 47-count indictment unsealed Wednesday named the company's co-owners as Scott Rosenberg, 45, and Josef Davenport, 31. Five women also were named in the indictment, identified as bookers for the alleged prostitution ring. The five women named in the indictment were identified as Patricia Krupa, Joanna Mercado, Sylvia Soto, Lina Vazquez and Barbara Morris. It was not immediately known if those charged had hired legal counsel. Five of the defendants appeared in court Wednesday afternoon, Cuomo's office said. Authorities are still searching for two, who have not yet been arrested. It was not immediately clear which two had not been arrested. Craigslist, an online classified-ad site, was the ""sole vehicle through which the company operated,"" Cuomo's office said. Room Service Entertainment posted advertisements for its services every day on Craigslist's erotic services section, the indictment said. The bookers for the company ""continuously created and posted prostitution advertisements on Craigslist's erotic services section because the more current the post, the more prominently the ad was featured on Craigslist,"" the statement from Cuomo's office said. The advertisements contained either a pornographic or semipornographic photograph and a phone number to call to ""arrange a date."" The bookers used codes for its services when potential ""johns"" called: ""GFE"" for ""girlfriend experience"" or ""skiing"" and ""rock climbing"" for drugs, Cuomo's office said. While Room Service Entertainment was running, it employed 10 drivers and 16 prostitutes on ""any given day,"" according to the indictment. Over the course of its existence, 20 to 30 prostitutes and drivers were employed by Room Service Entertainment, the indictment said. The ""johns"" paid for sex by cash or by credit card, and Room Service Entertainment masked the credit card transactions through a Chase merchant account, the indictment alleged. The charges were purported to be for magicians, clowns, balloons or disc jockeys, it said. If convicted on the top count of enterprise corruption, all could face up to 25 years in prison, Cuomo's office said. ""Until Craigslist gets serious about putting real protections in place, it will continue to be an environment where criminal operations thrive with impunity,"" Cuomo said in a written statement. ""Even after so-called reform of the Web site last fall, this prostitution ring easily gamed the system and allegedly used Craigslist to spread its illegal operation throughout all five boroughs and beyond."" Craigslist chief executive Jim Buckmaster released a statement saying the activities took place in 2008, ""well before Craigslist eliminated erotic services and commenced manual screening of all ads posted to adult services."" Craigslist representatives met in New York last week the attorneys general of Connecticut, Missouri and Illinois, all of whom asked the company to shut down its ""erotic services"" sections in their states. Following the meeting Craigslist said it would replace its controversial ""erotic services"" listings with a new section where sex-related ads will be checked by Craigslist employees before posting. Buckmaster said the new measures have driven the advertisements to other services.","Officials: Group ran a 24-hour prostitution ring from June 2007 to December 2008 .

"(CNN)The National Baseball Hall of Fame soon will have new, high-quality arms with the election of Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez and John Smoltz -- along with slugger Craig Biggio -- hall President Jeff Idelson announced Tuesday. The Baseball Writers' Association of America picked all three pitchers in their first time on the ballot. Biggio, who played 20 years with the Houston Astros as a catcher, second baseman and outfielder, made it in on his third try after falling a few votes shy last year. Johnson is the biggest of the bunch, by virtue of his 6-foot, 10-inch frame. Dubbed the ""Big Unit,"" he broke through with the Seattle Mariners and went on to star for the Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Yankees and San Francisco Giants -- racking up 4,875 strikeouts, five Cy Young awards and the 2001 World Series MVP honor in the process. Martinez got his start in Los Angeles, made a name for himself with the Montreal Expos and became a World Series winner with the Boston Red Sox before finishing off his career with the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies. The charismatic righty from the Dominican Republic posted 219 wins and 100 losses, along with 3,154 strikeouts, over his career. While Johnson and Martinez were both starting pitchers, Smoltz was that and more. The eight-time All-Star -- who spent almost his entire career with the Atlanta Braves -- had 24 wins as a starter in 1996, but became a relief pitcher five years later, including a remarkable 55 saves in 2002.","Randy Johnson, Pedro Martinez and John Smoltz go in on their first tries .

"On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate will have the opportunity to put a stop to one of the most expensive Environmental Protection Agency rules in history: the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule. This is the centerpiece of President Obama's war on coal. Called MATS, or Utility MACT, this rule will destroy jobs and cause energy prices to skyrocket. By voting for my resolution, SJR 37, members of the Senate can prevent the Obama EPA from inflicting so much economic pain on American families. How do we know that Utility MACT is designed to kill coal?  Just ask EPA Region One Administrator Curt Spalding, who was seen on video admitting that because of the EPA's regulatory barrage, ""If you want to build a coal plant you got a big problem.""  He went on to say that EPA's decision to kill coal was ""painful every step of the way,"" because ""if you go to West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and all those places, you have coal communities who depend on coal."" Well, those communities that depend on coal are feeling that pain, and that's why bipartisan momentum is growing for my resolution.  West Virginia's Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, a Democrat, recently wrote to West Virginia Sens. Joe Manchin and Jay Rockefeller urging them to vote for SJR 37, saying EPA's rules have ""coalesced to create an unprecedented attack on West Virginia's coal industry."" West Virginia's Lt. Gov. Jeffrey Kessler echoed this concern, saying that EPA is destroying the state's ""most valuable state natural resource and industry."" Labor, too, has come out to stop the job-killing over-regulation.  Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers, one of the biggest labor unions in the country, recently sent a letter to several senators asking them to support my resolution because of ""the threat that the EPA MATS rule poses to United Mine Workers Association members' jobs, the economies of coal field communities, and the future direction of our national energy policy."" In addition, we've also secured the support of the Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, the Farm Bureau and the National Association of Manufacturers, all of which represent major groups who are apparently not ""doing fine"" in the face of EPA's regulations. Let me be clear that this campaign to destroy coal is not about public health.  If it were, Democrats would not have voted against my Clear Skies bill back in 2005, a bill that would have achieved a reduction in mercury emissions of 70% by 2018.  In fact, at that time, then-Sen. Obama served with me on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.  As he explained, ""I voted against the Clear Skies bill.  In fact, I was the deciding vote."" There is a crucial difference between Clear Skies and Utility MACT.  Clear Skies would have reduced emissions without harming jobs and our economy because it was based on a common-sense, market-based approach, designed to retain coal as a generator of  electricity while reducing emissions each year.  On the other hand, Utility MACT is designed to kill coal as well as all the good paying jobs that come with it, while providing little -- if any -- environmental gain. Just before President Obama felt compelled to halt EPA's plan to tighten the ozone standard after significant push-back from Congress, then-White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley asked, ""What are the health impacts of unemployment?"" That is one of the most important questions before the Senate in preparation for the vote to stop Utility MACT.  What are the health impacts on children whose parents will lose their jobs because of President Obama's war on coal? What are the health impacts on children in low-income families whose parents will have to spend more for skyrocketing electricity costs and less on their kids' well-being? The good news is that Congress can halt President Obama's senseless war on fossil fuels and affordable energy. Many of my Democratic colleagues have gone on record saying they want to rein in this agency. Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill is one of them; she told Missourians that she is determined to ""hold the line on the EPA.""  Does that mean she, and other Senate Democrats who have made similar statements, will vote to stop the centerpiece of Obama's war on coal? I believe the EPA should go back to the drawing board and draft a rule targeted at mercury that would balance economic growth with environmental gain. The vote on my resolution will clearly demonstrate to the American people which senators will ""hold the line"" and stand with their constituents for jobs and affordable energy, and which senators will stand with President Obama and his global warming agenda that will be painful -- ""every step of the way"" -- for their constituents.

"Harry Belafonte, one of the nation's most prominent African-American performers and social activists, is suing the children of the nation's pre-eminent civil rights leader, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The battle between the families of civil rights titans, over three documents, is detailed in a  federal court lawsuit Belafonte filed against Bernice King, Dexter King and Martin Luther King III. The dispute began in 2008 when Belafonte tried to sell the documents through a Sotheby's auction in what he said was a fundraiser for a community organization. The King estate stopped the sale, alleging the documents did not belong to Belafonte. Now, Belafonte, who is 86, is suing to establish his ownership of the materials. The lawsuit is an ugly twist in a family friendship that has become part of the story of the American civil rights movement. Belafonte, as a successful African-American musician and actor, is said to have provided for the very children he is now suing so King could pursue his activism. He also raised and donated money to sponsor major civil rights actions like the Freedom Rides. In her autobiography, Coretta Scott King said of Belafonte: ""Whenever we got into trouble or when tragedy struck, Harry has always come to our aid, his generous heart wide open."" He had a public split with the family in 2006, when the children disinvited him to speak at their mother's funeral after President George W. Bush announced he would attend. Belafonte had been an outspoken critic of  Bush. In an interview that year on Democracy Now, Belafonte spoke of what motivated his financial support of King's family, saying he wanted to make sure ""the welfare of his family would never be in jeopardy with him being at the helm of the movement, and we brought resources, and it was my task to direct all that, watching the kids grow, put money aside for their studies, to take care of Coretta, to make sure she had every convenience at her disposal to go, come while her husband was incarcerated."" King was said to make $8,000 a year as a preacher. According to the lawsuit, the three documents in question were given to Belafonte by King or his aides and widow. They include reflections of how close the two men were, such as an outline written on a legal pad in Belafonte's apartment for one of King's signature speeches. There are also notes for a speech King had in his pocket the day he was shot to death. King and his wife were known for giving documents as gifts and Belafonte is one of many associates who lay claim to what would become a library of civil rights papers. Belafonte, the King children, their lawyers and representatives would not comment on the litigation. But the dispute is in line with other legal actions by the King family to regain King's documents. They have repeatedly lost legal efforts to take back papers given to individuals or institutions by King, a fact Belafonte's lawsuit points out. In this case, the lawsuit maintains the family's legal claim to the documents has expired.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- A London-based Web site has dropped a Dutch lawmaker's film that features disturbing images of terrorist acts juxtaposed with verses from the Quran to paint Islam as a threat to Western society, citing threats to its staff. Geert Wilders' 15-minute film, ""Fitna,"" was the top film on LiveLeak.com on Thursday. LiveLeak.com said in a statement Friday that it decided to remove the film a day after it was posted ""following threats to our staff of a very serious nature."" Attempts to reach LiveLeak for further comment were unsuccessful. However, Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende said the government was concerned that Geert Wilders' film ""Fitna"" could provoke a violent backlash. ""The possibilities are there of real threats,"" Balkenende said. ""I have already warned Dutch people that there could be enormous consequences on the basis of our intelligence services and what we heard from the business sector."" Early response in the Netherlands was restrained, but hundreds of Muslims rallied in Pakistan, where the government temporarily blocked access to YouTube last month over a trailer for Wilders' film. The protesters burned the Dutch flag and called on Pakistan to cut ties with the Netherlands. The Dutch government and others, including the European Union and the Organization of the Islamic Conference, have rejected the film. Still, Wilders stood by his project. ""My intention was not to offend in any way but to show the truth -- at least, the truth as I see it,"" Wilders said. ""And if the truth hurts and could be offensive, well, this of course is not my problem.""  Watch Geert Wilders speak about his controversial film » . Wilders, a member of the Dutch parliament from the conservative Party for Freedom and an outspoken critic of Islam, said he doesn't hate Muslims. But he said he has ""big problems"" with the Prophet Mohammed, the Quran and ""everything that is stated inside this terrible book."" Despite LiveLeak's decision to drop the film, ""Fitna"" was posted on several other Web sites, including Google Video and YouTube, a Google subsidiary. The film was easily accessible via Google, but YouTube posted a disclaimer with the video and required a login to view it. In a statement, YouTube said, ""YouTube allows individuals to express themselves and to communicate with a global audience. The diversity of the world in which we live ... means that some of the beliefs and views of some individuals may offend others."" The film is also hosted on a Dutch Web site. The Web site of Wilders' political party also links to sites where the film can be viewed. The title of the 15-minute film, ""Fitna,"" translates in Arabic to ""strife"" or ""conflict"" of the type that occurs within families or any other homogenous group. Criticism of Wilders and the film grew Friday. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the film, calling it ""offensively anti-Islamic"" while urging calm. ""There is no justification for hate speech or incitement to violence,"" he said in a statement. ""The right of free expression is not at stake here."" E-mail to a friend .

"Kenneth Bae, the American citizen sentenced to 15 years in a North Korean labor camp, has been moved to a hospital after a serious deterioration in his health, his sister said. Detained in North Korea in November and sentenced in April for ""hostile acts to bring down its government,"" Bae is now suffering from severe back and leg pain and has lost more than 50 pounds, his sister Terri Chung told CNN late Sunday. Chung said she received the information from the U.S. State Department, which told her the Swedish ambassador to North Korea had visited Bae in the hospital on Friday. Sweden represents U.S. interests in North Korea because the United States has no diplomatic presence in the secretive state. Detention in North Korea has taken a heavy toll on Bae, who had already been dealing with other health problems, including diabetes. ""I think the last three months in the labor camp have certainly been very trying on both his mental and physical health,"" Chung said by phone from the Seattle area. Bae from North Korean prison: Please help me . 'Tremendous' stress . The eight hours per day of farm labor, which Bae had never done before, appear to have worsened his symptoms, she said, adding that ""he's also under a tremendous amount of stress."" Other problems he's suffering from include kidney stones, dizziness, blurred vision and loss of vision. The family is ""extremely concerned"" about the situation and is pleading with the U.S. government to help Bae's case, Chung said. U.S. officials have repeatedly called on North Korea to release Bae, whose sentence was announced toward the end of a period of heightened tensions between the two countries. The State Department called for Bae's release again in a news conference Monday. ""We continue to urge the DPRK authorities to grant Mr. Bae amnesty an immediate release,"" said Marie Harf, the department's deputy spokeswoman. ""It's clear that Mr. Bae's health is deteriorated.  We've been concerned about his health for a long time, and is of deep concern to us today. But Kim Jong Un's regime has so far showed no sign of budging on the case of Bae, who they call Pae Jun Ho. There didn't appear to be any recent articles published about Bae by North Korea's state-run Korean Central News Agency. Hoping for release . In a video released early last month, Bae appealed to North Korean authorities for forgiveness and asked the United States for help in securing his release. ""Although my health is not good, I am being patient and coping well,"" Bae said, his head shaved and his face noticeably thinner than in earlier photos. in that interview, he spoke of health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver and a back problem. ""I know what I did is not easily forgivable, but I hope that things will work out so that I can be with my family again soon,"" he said. Chung had previously said that Bae is the owner of a tour company and was in North Korea for work. North Korean state media have detailed the reasons why Bae was sentenced. Among the list of alleged crimes was setting up bases in China for the purpose of ""toppling"" the North Korean government, encouraging North Korean citizens to bring down the government and conducting a ""malignant smear campaign."" State media also say that Bae had planned what it called a ""Jericho operation"" to bring down North Korea through religious activities. They have suggested that Bae could have been sentenced to death, but avoided it through ""candid confession of his crimes.""

"North Korea fired two projectiles Sunday that ""appear to be short-range missiles"" into the sea off the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula, a South Korean Defense Ministry official told CNN. The launch took place shortly before 5 a.m. (4 p.m. ET Saturday), according to the official. The projectiles' estimated range is 500 kilometers (about 300 miles). A U.S. State Department official reacted to Saturday's launch, telling CNN, ""We call on North Korea to refrain from taking provocative actions and instead fulfill its international obligations and commitments."" This is the second reported launch by North Korea in recent days. On Thursday, U.S. and South Korean government officials reported North Korea had launched three projectiles from its southeastern coast. North Korea has launched missiles several times in the past, often while South Korea is interacting with foreign powers. In early March, missiles were fired into the sea at the start of joint United States-South Korea military exercises. In late March, the same thing happened while the South Korean leadership met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Barack Obama.

"Key West, Florida (CNN) -- For more than 20 years, the bulletproof museum case housed a small piece of yesteryear: a gold bar recovered from a sunken Spanish galleon. Today, its case is broken, littered with black fingerprint dust. The treasure is gone. Stolen. Two thieves were caught in the act by the museum's security cameras. ""This is a special piece,"" said Melissa Kendrick, executive director of the Mel Fisher Maritime Museum in Key West, Florida. ""All the pieces have an incredible historic value, but this is the piece that was shared with the public in a whole totally different way."" It was different because visitors could touch it. By reaching into the specially designed display case, more than 6 million people have touched the 74.85-ounce bar, valued at more than $550,000. ""They're touching something that belonged to someone in 1622,"" said Carol Shaughnessy, author of ""Diving Into Glory."" ""Ordinarily people don't get to touch something like that. You can't touch an Egyptian mummy. This is a hands-on connection to history."" But now, what does a thief do with a priceless, high-profile artifact? Is there an underground market that will pay $550,000 for this almost 400-year-old piece of solid gold? One expert says no. ""That's why these crimes don't make a whole lot of money for the criminals,"" said Robert Wittman, a former FBI agent who once headed the FBI's Art Crime Team. ""It doesn't make sense to do it."" Wandering through the museum, the thieves can be seen in security video trying to open museum doors. The video is incredibly clear. First, they appeared to be targeting a display case of gold chains. Then, after a security guard left this part of the museum, a man can be seen reaching into the case housing the gold bar and placing the little piece of history into his pocket before exiting the museum. ""We're getting information and following leads,"" said Key West Police Chief Donie Lee. ""Unfortunately we haven't got the best lead, which is, I know that person and we go out, and it's a positive ID, and we're able to go out and pick those guys up."" What makes the crime so shocking, police said, is that the thieves were able to snap the glass at its edges. It's not just any glass, but three-eighths-inch thick bulletproof Lexan glass. ""By designating this as a handling object, it brought certain risks to the bar,"" Kendrick said. ""But after your first five, and your next 10, and when you get to 25 years, you start to get to the point when you think that it's never going to happen."" Treasure hunter and salvor Mel Fisher recovered the solid gold bar from the wreck of the Santa Margarita in 1980. Fisher and his team had been searching for the Nuestra Senora de Atocha and instead found the sister ship, the Santa Margarita. Both ships had gone down in a hurricane off Key West shortly after leaving Havana, Cuba, in 1622. The ships were headed home to Spain with a cargo of gold, silver and coins from the new world. The team found the Atocha in 1985. The stolen bar is one of dozens of gold and silver bars retrieved from the bottom of the sea. Experts say that about 90 percent of stolen art and artifacts is eventually recovered that but it often takes years to find. The FBI has recovered more than 2,600 items of cultural property valued at more than $142 million. The items range from Colombian artifacts to Rembrandt paintings. Wittman, the former FBI agent and author of ""Priceless: How I Went Undercover to Rescue the World's Stolen Treasures,"" said the market is incredibly small for these high-profile objects. He said thieves often steal the items and then try to figure how to sell them. ""We recovered paintings and artifacts that were missing for many years. Ten, 15, sometimes 20 years, because the thieves couldn't get rid of them,"" he said. ""They kept them in their closets. They were white elephants. They made no money out of the deals. They were stuck."" In 1990, thieves entered the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, Massachusetts, and stole 13 works of art, including three Rembrandts from the 1600s. None has been recovered, and federal agents are using DNA to try to find the perpetrators. Wittman said no legitimate collector would take the risks associated with buying stolen goods. ""They don't buy stolen property, because ... they can't show it, they can't enjoy it. ... It makes them into criminals, and the last thing they want to do is spend a lot of money for a painting or for an artifact, whether it's gold or whatever, and have it seized by the police and go to jail,"" he said. Key West authorities said they believe the thieves were not locals and that they are probably long gone. The museum's insurance company is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the return of the bar. Police said they remain hopeful they will solve the crime but just hope they can recover this golden piece of history. ""This is going to end up in somebody's house probably, used as a paperweight,"" said Lee, who is leading the investigation. ""Other than melting it down, which is the worst-case scenario for everyone, we're just hoping that they will come to their senses somehow and return this back to the museum.""","Gold bar stolen from Key West, Florida, museum is worth more than $550,000 .

"It was with a call for the protection of the weakest in society that Francis was officially inaugurated Tuesday as the Catholic Church's 266th pontiff, before a crowd of tens of thousands bathed in sunlight. Giving his homily before the throngs in St. Peter's Square, Francis showed the humility and concern for ordinary people that have been noted since he became the first Latin American to be elected pope six days ago. What do you think about the new pope? Tell us . Before he spoke, he was given the official symbols of his papacy: a lamb's wool shawl, to represent his role as ""the good shepherd,"" and the Fisherman's Ring, to represent his role of spreading the gospel. The ring is not solid gold like that of his predecessors, but made of gold-plated silver -- again reflecting his desire for simplicity. The pope delivered his homily in Italian, rooted in a message of looking after the poor and sick, as well as the natural world. He reflected first on the symbolism of the date: this is the day that Catholics celebrate the Feast of St. Joseph to honor Jesus' father on Earth, the carpenter Joseph. Francis spoke of Joseph's role in protecting not only Jesus and Mary, but also the church. He spoke too of the need to protect ""all creation, the beauty of the created world"" as instructed by the Bible and shown by St. Francis of Assisi, whose name he took as pope. This, he said, ""means respecting each of God's creatures and respecting the environment in which we live. It means protecting people, showing loving concern for each and every person, especially children, the elderly, those in need, who are often the last we think about."" Catholics: 5 ways for Francis to move forward . He warned of the consequences if people do not look after one another. ""Whenever human beings fail to live up to this responsibility, whenever we fail to care for creation and for our brothers and sisters, the way is opened to destruction and hearts are hardened."" And he urged those in power to live up to their duties, and to all to avoid evil, hatred and pride. ""I would like to ask all those who have positions of responsibility in economic, political and social life, and all men and women of goodwill: Let us be 'protectors' of creation, protectors of God's plan inscribed in nature, protectors of one another and of the environment,"" he said. Kissing babies . After his homily, 500 priests dispensed communion to the throngs of locals, pilgrims, tourists and dignitaries gathered for the historic occasion. Between 150,000 and 200,000 people turned out in and around St. Peter's Square, said the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman. Police in the area told CNN there were fewer people than expected but declined to give an estimate. Pope Francis earlier made his way into the square atop an open-top vehicle, spending 17 minutes circling among the crowds in bright sunshine. He wore the simple iron cross that he's had since he was appointed bishop and that he had on when he first appeared to the world as pope. And he chose black shoes rather than the red ones favored by Benedict XVI. When the gathered faithful held up babies and young children for him to kiss, he obliged. He also stepped out of his sport utility vehicle to kiss the head of a man with a physical disability. Even though at least a dozen security officers in suits walked alongside the SUV as he circled the square, his decision to bypass the Popemobile, which his last two predecessors used, was telling. The Mercedes Benz G-Class SUV afforded him the kind of direct contact with people he has embraced since becoming pope. Had he been in the Popemobile, he would have been behind bulletproof glass, which was installed in 1981 after an assassination attempt on John Paul II. Filipino priest and CNN iReporter Joel Camaya, who was among those in St. Peter's Square, was enthralled by the spectacle, and the contrasting humility, of the newly elected pontiff. ""The Pope spoke with such passion and force that the words exuded life and thus, as he spoke, there were instances of spontaneous applause,"" he said. ""In the piazza, people who haven't even known each other exchanged smiles, happy that they belonged to one big family."" Francis called his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, Monday afternoon to wish him well on the day of the Feast of St. Joseph and to thank him again for his service. Benedict, in turn, said he had been following the events since Francis' selection closely and assured his closeness in prayer. Pope's sister prayed he wouldn't be picked; now she's proud . Style or substance? The Mass which inaugurated Francis as bishop of Rome and marked the official start of his papacy was short, lasting about two hours. This was in keeping with the spirit of simplicity embraced by the new pontiff, the Vatican said before the occasion. Francis has already made an impression as a pope of the people who is concerned about the welfare of the poor. But he inherits a church wracked by a decades-old sexual abuse scandal and claims of corruption in the clergy. Monsignor Kevin Irwin told CNN the Catholic Church probably would not have to wait long before the changes in style already seen under Francis become changes in substance. ""It comes down to personnel,"" he said. ""The personnel changes you make in any corporation make all the difference. Leadership matters -- but then who are the other people who help implement his program?"" The Vatican said Saturday that Francis had provisionally confirmed members of the Vatican hierarchy in their positions, but would take time to reflect before any final appointments are confirmed. Irwin said he believes the key changes are likely to come in the late spring or early summer. Francis, as a member of the Jesuit order, ""gets into things"" and is tenacious, he said. ""This is a 'take-charge' pope, I would say."" Pope's openness to keep guards on their toes . World figures . Back in St. Peter's Basilica, the newly installed bishop of Rome greeted the dignitaries who had flocked from around the world to attend the inauguration Mass. President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, from Francis' native Argentina, was the first head of state to step up. Vice President Joe Biden, leading the U.S. presidential delegation, was also among those to meet the 76-year-old pope, as was Zimbabwe's controversial President Robert Mugabe. Mugabe is subject to a European Union travel ban but allowed to visit the continent for religious events and international conferences. Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone -- effectively the Vatican's prime minister -- was at the pope's side as, standing, he gave his greetings for close to an hour and a half. The formal encounters over, Francis then went to the barriers around the sides of the basilica to greet priests, nuns and other well-wishers. In his first tweet after his inauguration on the @Pontifex account, Pope Francis said: ""Let us keep a place for Christ in our lives, let us care for one another and let us be loving custodians of creation."" He then tweeted again: ""True power is service. The Pope must serve all people, especially the poor, the weak, the vulnerable."" Argentines watch Mass . Back in Francis' home city, the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, the faithful packed the main square to watch the event on large screens set up throughout the Plaza de Mayo. According to the state-run newspaper Telam, a telephone call Francis had made from the Vatican was played to all present, saying: ""Thanks for the prayers."" He added, ""Let us be aware of one another, care for life, nature, children and old people,"" before concluding by asking those present to pray for him. Groups also gathered in other cities throughout Argentina to watch the early morning Mass, Telam reported. The event in St. Peter's Square was attended by 132 delegations from around the world, including six reigning sovereigns and 31 heads of state. Bergoglio's journey to top of the church . Those delegations are among scores from nations and international organizations traveling to the Vatican, led by heads of states and governments. European Union leaders Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman Van Rompuy were among those present. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi accompanied Biden in the U.S. delegation, the White House said. On Friday, House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, said he would send a separate bipartisan congressional delegation. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York, in a letter sent to Francis on Tuesday, offered the ""deep affection, prayerful support and sincere pledge of fidelity"" of the U.S. bishops and more than 70 million Catholics in the country. Also at the Vatican were groups from the Americas, including Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Canada, and from European nations such as Italy, Holland, Belgium and Germany. Representatives from across Christianity -- Eastern and Western -- were also present, along with members of other religions, including Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism. This is also one of the busiest times of the year on the Christian calendar, which will mean many public appearances for the new pontiff. Less than a week away is Palm Sunday, the holiday that kicks off Holy Week, which culminates in Easter celebrations. The Vatican press office said Francis will also have one other task to keep him busy: figuring out ""how to answer the millions of e-mail messages that have already been received, despite the fact that he still doesn't have an official address.""

"Amiyrah Martin of Edison, New Jersey, an African-American mom of two, says she and her husband are still trying to figure out how to sit their 8-year-old son down and explain the Trayvon Martin case and its conclusion -- without getting emotional. ""My biggest issue is ... giving him the facts rather than getting upset and giving him how I feel, because I want him to come to his own consensus,"" the host of the blog Four Hats and Frugal said in an interview. ""My husband is the same way. He's very emotional about it ... so he doesn't want him to think, 'Well, Dad feels this way so I should.' He wants him to create his own opinion."" When Martin, who is not related to Trayvon Martin's family, ultimately has the conversation with her little guy, who always ""likes to know the why,"" he'll no doubt ask about race, she said. ""We're going to have to tell him that it may have been due to Trayvon's race, and this is how it happened, and this is how George Zimmerman decided to react to it,"" she said. ""It's going to be very hard to sit him down and have the conversation, but we know we have to do it."" While not everyone agrees that Martin was racially profiled, the case and the protests that followed have led to larger conversations between parents and kids. Some are focusing on race -- Martin was black and Zimmerman identifies as Hispanic, so it's not just a black and white issue. Still, others aren't even talking about race but are focusing on behavior. But when I set out to interview moms about the verdict, and ask what they are telling their kids, I got two very different responses. African-American moms like Amiyrah Martin were extremely willing and interested to talk about their experiences, while very few moms who were not African-American came forward. Then I saw a post by Liz Gumbinner, a white mom of two and author of the blog Mom-101, which explained a lot -- that white moms aren't talking about the story, at least not publicly, and they should be. ""I think that non-African-Americans are talking about it privately, but they are nervous to talk about it publicly, and I think this is an ongoing issue in the U.S., that race is still a topic that people are afraid to discuss unless you're a person of color and you're living it every day,"" Gumbinner told me. ""It's easy for my friends of color who are mothers to say, 'That could have been my kid and it feels personal,' and it's easier for them to speak out and take action the way I think so many white people did with Sandy Hook, for example -- 'That could have been my kid,'"" she added. ""What's important is for us to remember is that it could have been any of our kids, skin color aside, and so there are so many layered issues that we have to have these conversations."" Gumbinner says she hasn't talked with her girls, ages 6 and 8, about the Trayvon Martin case, but if her 8-year-old hears about it, she'll discuss it with her. ""I'd rather talk about the macro issue with her, about treating people with respect and not judging people based on how they look, than get into the details of a murder case. She is still very young."" One mom's message to her kids . While some parents may approach the topic from the viewpoint that Martin was more likely to be treated differently because he was African-American, other parents are using the case as a behavioral lesson and leaving race aside. Catherine Martines Mortensen, a mom of two in Fairfax, Virginia, watched a lot of the trial with her 15-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son, and discussed the verdict when it was handed down. ""I told my kids both people used really poor judgment,"" she said during an interview. ""They had assumptions about the other, even without knowing the situation. Neither one of them should have engaged. They should have left."" ""I told my kids, if they are ever in a situation where they don't know if someone's following them or what's going on, they just need to get home. Don't linger around,"" she said. As they watched the trial, she said her kids were constantly trying to figure out who was right and who was wrong. ""My kids would go back and forth. One would say, 'Well, Trayvon, it was his fault because he started the fight.' The other one would have said, 'Well, Zimmerman, he should have never gotten out of the car.' I think it was never clear-cut."" ""A lot of times children's brains will try to process information in a very black and white way, but in this case, they couldn't do that,"" she said. Comforting a brother who doesn't understand . Cindy Rodriguez, editor for Latino audiences at CNN.com, went to pick up her 14-year-old brother for a movie outing Sunday, a day after the verdict was announced. Her brother carried a hoodie over his arm. His father told him not to put it on until they got inside the movie theater. Her brother didn't understand, and told Rodriguez their dad said it's because of ""that kid that died."" ""He didn't have a gun on him, right? So why would that other guy shoot him?"" her little brother asked. When she told him about the ""stand your ground"" law in Florida, her brother responded that Trayvon Martin was ""so small."" ""Every question that seems so obvious to everyone that's so shocked by the verdict, I see it in my little brother's eyes,"" she told me. ""He said, 'I just don't get it. ... Why would they have that law?' "" Rodriguez said she has steered away from talking about race with her brother, saying she was always raised to believe she is the same as everyone else. But after the Trayvon Martin case, she felt she needed to talk with her brother about it. ""We kind of live in a world where the minority teenager with the hoodie on means trouble, and unfortunately that's kind of the way things are going now,"" she told her brother. She told him he might not encounter racism now because he lives in a predominantly Hispanic community, but that when he leaves his neighborhood in North Bergen, New Jersey, that could change. ""People are going to approach you differently,"" she told him, giving a big-sister message she really wishes she'd never had to give. Conflicted about whether to have the conversation . Marie Stroughter, an African-American mother with three children, including a 15-year-old son, said she and her husband are having ""deep"" conversations about whether they should talk with their kids about the case and the reactions to the verdict. ""I think our fear is we've raised them as much as possible in this society to be pretty much colorblind,"" the co-creator of the blog African-American Conservatives told me during an interview. ""I mean, they are aware of their own heritage, but our fear is injecting thoughts into them that they don't necessarily need to have. Do we want them to view people with suspicion that don't need to be viewed with suspicion?"" Stroughter worries that by telling her children to watch out for discrimination from certain people, they'll end up doing the very thing she wants them to avoid -- racially profiling others. While she tries to figure out what to do, she says she and her husband will continue to rely on their strong Christian faith. ""The only thing we can think of is to teach them Christian values that are colorblind,"" she added. Mom guilt . Amiyrah Martin showcased a picture of her son on a post titled ""This is My Boy,"" in which she confessed to feeling something else after the Travyon Martin verdict -- mom guilt. ""I do feel a little bit of guilt because I did bring him into this world, him and his sister, and they're going to have a lot of adversity still to come -- so should I have thought about that before I brought them into this world? Is it fair that I did that to them? And that's been in the back of my mind quite a bit since it happened,"" she told me. When Martin ultimately has the talk with her son, I don't know if she'll share that she's feeling some mom guilt. Maybe if we'd all start talking about race in all of our households -- not just the ones headed by African-Americans -- moms like Martin wouldn't have anything to feel guilty about.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama tore into the Republican opposition on Capitol Hill Wednesday, blaming the GOP for what he called politically motivated opposition on virtually every issue. Democrats have been willing to incorporate Republican ideas on health care and other issues, he said, but Republicans have not been willing to do the same. Addressing a gathering of Senate Democrats, Obama promised to ""call (Republicans) out when (Democrats) extend a hand and get a fist in return."" Several Democrats facing tough election fights this November were given time to ask the president questions on high-profile issues such as trade and deficit reduction. Much of the president's time, however, was used to lash out at GOP tactics. Senate Republicans, he said, have tried to employ the filibuster more over the past year than in all of the 1950s and 1960s combined. The GOP's strategy has been ""20 years of obstruction packed into one,"" he said. ""If you want to govern, you can't just say no,"" he argued. ""It can't be about just scoring points."" The filibuster, he added, only works as intended if there is a ""genuine spirit of compromise."" The president's tough rhetoric was part of a more aggressive -- and frequently populist -- White House strategy in the wake of the Democrats' recent upset loss in the Massachusetts Senate race. GOP Sen.-elect Scott Brown's victory stripped Democrats of their 60-seat Senate supermajority and raised fears among many congressional Democrats about a potential GOP landslide in the upcoming midterm elections. The Democratic answer to the Massachusetts Senate race should not be ""to do nothing"" in Congress, he said. Nervous constituents want to see legislative progress, he asserted. ""We should do more, and we should do so without delay,"" he said. In recent days -- during a meeting with House Republicans in Maryland and in town hall forums in Florida and New Hampshire -- Obama has repeatedly offered to work with GOP leaders. At the same time, he has been ratcheting up his own partisan rhetoric. ""By extending an olive branch to Republicans, the president appears to be attempting to appeal to independent voters who have flocked to the GOP over the past several months,"" CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser said. ""But the president also needs to rally a deflated and angry Democratic base, which accounts in part for his tougher attacks against GOP leaders."" Obama cited several examples of what he said was GOP legislative maneuvering motivated purely by political considerations. Among other things, he raised the recent example of seven GOP senators who backed a bill establishing a bipartisan deficit reduction commission, but then turned against it when the proposal came to a vote. He also noted that a large number of bills have been subjected to Republican-led filibusters, only to receive 85 or 90 votes once the filibuster is broken and the legislation is allowed to move to a final vote. I'm ""not open to switches"" solely ""because it's good short-term politics,"" he said. I won't tolerate an ""if you lose, I win"" mentality. Obama urged Senate Democrats to stop listening to what he called politically oriented cable television shows on networks such as Fox News, CNN and MSNBC, and instead get out of the Washington ""echo chamber."" Most people ""don't care about majorities and minorities and process,"" he said. They just want to know if their elected representatives are ""delivering for me."" The president warned fellow Democrats that the public is often misinformed on key issues such as budget deficits. Many constituents will cite foreign aid or legislative earmarks when discussing ways to reduce spending, he said, when in reality those items constitute a minuscule share of federal spending. Balancing the budget while refusing to raise taxes and exempting entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare would require 60 percent cuts in virtually every other program, and ""that's just not going to happen,"" he said. Noting that Bill Clinton left office with budget surpluses, Obama asserted that Democrats ""should have credibility"" on the deficit issue. But the party is ""still haunted"" by debates from the 1960s and '70s when the party was stuck with the ""tax and spend"" label, he said. CNN's Dana Bash and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: ""To do nothing"" not right response to the Massachusetts Senate race, says Obama .

"Ninety people were killed in a day of punishing air assaults on Aleppo as so-called barrel bombs rained down on the city, an opposition group said. Women and children were among the victims in Saturday's raids in various neighborhoods in the rebel stronghold, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sunday. It added that 10 fighters from the radical Nusra Front were killed when their headquarters were targeted. Nine people were killed near Aleppo's central prison, it said. Barrel bombs -- drums packed with explosives and shrapnel -- can level entire buildings with one hit. In four hours, the area of Ansari was targeted with about 17 air strikes, one medical staffer from a field hospital in Aleppo told CNN. ""The humanitarian situation is very bad, there is a huge number of wounded people,"" he said from the Turkish border, where he had gone to get supplies. ""I am so nervous because my staff inside (have) become so confused, I have to calm them, I don't know what I will have to do for tomorrow."" 'Urgent situation' In a report released Thursday, Human Rights Watch said the Syrian government ""deliberately and unlawfully"" demolished thousands of homes in rebel strongholds in the cities of Damascus and Hama in one year. CNN cannot independently verify daily death tolls, but the United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since 2011. Aleppo has come under punishing, sometimes near-daily, air raids. ""The situation is very urgent,"" the medic said. ""We need U.S. pressure on the regime for us to be able to take a breath, to have them stop this aggressive shelling on Aleppo."" He said all the roads to the city were blocked. The Syrian government has previously said the operations are targeting ""terrorist groups"" in neighborhoods of Aleppo. Syrian refugees flood into Jordan . Peace talks . News of the bombings came after a first round of Syrian peace talks ended in Geneva on Friday with no progress towards ending a nearly three-year civil war. The contentious first round began with bitter exchanges and repeatedly seemed on the verge of collapse before the two sides entered the same room. The next round of negotiations is due to start February 10 but the government has been unable to say whether it will return. According to Syrian state news agency SANA, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem ruled out any direct talks with the U.S. unless ""Secretary of State, John Kerry, apologizes for what he had said during the opening speech of the conference."" Syrian government non-committal on more talks . In opening remarks, Kerry said the path to peace had to involve the world community and could not include Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whom he accused of widespread human rights abuses. The conflict has also been mired by accusations that the Damascus government used chemical weapons and that the opposition includes al Qaeda-affiliated groups. ""This is a modest beginning, but it is a beginning on which we can build,"" U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi told reporters after the talks ended Friday.","Barrel bombs rained down on rebel stronghold on Saturday - opposition group .

"Washington (CNN) -- Republican Joni Ernst has a small lead over Democrat Bruce Braley in Iowa's Senate race, a new CNN/ORC International poll shows. Ernst had 49% support, topping Braley's 47%, in the survey of 647 likely voters, which was conducted Oct. 27-30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. The two candidates have exactly the same favorability ratings: Ernst, a state senator, and Braley, a congressman, are each viewed favorably by 49% of those surveyed, and unfavorably by 47%. Iowa is one of several states that President Barack Obama won at least once -- Colorado, North Carolina and New Hampshire are the others -- where Republicans are hoping to grab Senate seats previously held by Democrats. Their success in those states could determine whether the GOP captures the six seats it needs to become the Senate's majority party for Obama's last two years in office. Democrats traditionally perform better among women, and in Iowa, the survey showed Braley with a 12 percentage point advantage in that category. But Ernst outperforms him among men, where she holds a 15 percentage point lead. ""Braley has an advantage among urban and suburban voters, but Ernst appears to be winning rural voters handily -- a key strength in a state like Iowa,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. It's just the latest poll to show a deadlocked race in Iowa, where the two candidates are battling for the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin. A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Oct. 23-29 found the candidates tied at 45%. And a Quinnipiac survey conducted Oct. 22-27 gave Ernst a lead over Braley, 49% to 45%.","A CNN/ORC International poll shows Republican Joni Ernst leading Iowa's Senate race .

"Environmental activists are willing to bring their qualms with their traditional ally the Democrats right to their front door -- literally. Opponents of the Keystone XL Pipeline plopped an inflatable ""pipeline"" on Sen. Mary Landrieu's front yard on Monday -- and the Louisiana senator likely isn't complaining. Landrieu is trying to push the pipeline through the Senate as she faces an uphill climb to hold on to her seat in a December runoff against Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy. The pipeline could be a boon to Louisiana's Gulf oil-rich economy and passage of a bill authorizing the pipeline would be a high profile and new accomplishment that Landrieu could point to. The visuals of more than 50 protesters picketing on Landrieu's front yard with ""No KXL"" signs could bolster Landrieu's status as a serious threat to opponents of the pipeline and positions her as a key player in the effort to bring more than a dozen Senate Democrats on board to support the bill and send it to President Barack Obama's desk. Activists even walked up to the front stoop of Landrieu's D.C. home and knocked on the door -- no answer. But progressive activists at the protest said they weren't concerned about Landrieu's reelection prospects, acknowledging that both Landrieu and her opponent support Keystone XL. ""It's one vote in the Senate, and either way it's a yes vote on the Keystone pipeline,"" said Karthik Ganapathy, an organizer with the environmental organization 350. Instead, Ganapathy and other activists said the protest was about more than Landrieu -- sending a message to national Democrats that they risk losing their base if they support policies like Keystone. ""We're not going to lie down and say, 'Oh but they're a Democrat,'"" Ganapathy said. ""The people that you're looking at here, these are the people that Hillary Clinton, the Democrats of 2016 and beyond are going to need to knock on doors and turnout the vote."" Thirteen other Senate Democrats also risk having inflatable pipelines strewn across their front yard. So far, 14 Democrats, including Landrieu, reportedly plan to join Republicans in supporting the project Tuesday -- putting the Senate just one vote shy of the filibuster-proof 60-vote majority. Deirdre Shelly, a senior at American University and self-described ""disillusioned Democrat"", said she came out to oppose the pipeline project and to send a message to all Democrats considering supporting the project. ""Young voters are not going to vote for anyone who approves this pipeline and it's also shameful [that Senate Democrats are considering it],"" Shelly said. ""I'm excited that the climate movement and younger people are finally going after Democrats and I expect that to continue as long as they continue to say yes to the pipeline."" The rally also brought activists from outside the Beltway, from the areas that could be impacted if the pipeline project goes through -- an unclear outcome at the moment as Obama has suggested he would  veto the project if it passes the Senate. Activists from South Dakota with the Native American group Wica Agli said they are concerned about the environmental impact of the pipeline as well as its impact on the society. Aldo Seoane, the group's co-director, said the inflatable pipeline was a much-needed image to share their perspective. ""They don't understand what we're fighting for and they need these visuals so they can feel what we're feeling,"" Seoane said. ""No one wants a pipeline running through their yard."" Nebraskan Art Tanderup, a Democrat whose farm is one of many on the pipeline's planned route, said he would never support Landrieu's campaign because of her betrayal of the Democratic base ""just to get reelected."" ""We're here to try and convince people not to support the Keystone XL pipeline,"" he said when asked about the impact on Landrieu's reelection prospects. But pressed as to whether he would support Landrieu or her Republican opponent, Tanderup said he would be in a bind. ""This would be a very difficult situation for me to vote,"" Tanderup said. ""Because of other issues and other differences, I would probably vote for her."" Landrieu's office did not immediately return a request for comment.","Anti-Keystone protesters picketing on Landrieu's front yard could help Landrieu in Louisiana .

"More details emerged in state media Thursday about the dismissal of the highest-ranking Chinese official yet since President Xi Jinping launched a massive campaign against corruption -- a lightning rod for public discontent across the country. Su Rong, a former vice chairman of China's top political advisory body, was formally removed from his post on Wednesday. Though little known outside of China, Su's position at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made him a ""state leader"" in the official hierarchy. The downfall of Su, a senior member of the ruling Communist Party who served as the Party boss in three provinces, was made public on June 14. The Party's disciplinary commission said in a brief online announcement that he is under investigation for the ""serious violation of laws and Party disciplines."" 'Flies and tigers' State media has since characterized Su as the biggest ""tiger"" caught in President Xi's anti-graft campaign. After taking power in late 2012, Xi banned official extravagance -- from banquets to year-end gifts -- and vowed to target ""flies and tigers"" alike in his fight against corruption when describing his resolve to spare no one regardless of their position. The state-run Xinhua news agency recently touted the catching of 30 ""tigers"" after the investigations of Su as well as two other provincial leaders became known. Su, 65, and his wife profited tremendously through bribes and illegal land deals when he ran the southeastern province of Jiangxi, state media reported. He was also implicated in tampering with evidence in a criminal trial and covering up the death toll in the breaching of a local dam, according to state media. Zhou Yongkang . Some China watchers have noted Su's ties to Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar who has been rumored to be under investigation for some time. State media has reported official probes into many of Zhou's family members as well as former associates in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and Sichuan Province in the southwest -- three places Zhou once ruled. If announced, Zhou would replace Su to become the highest-ranking official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic. In 2013, some 182,000 officials were disciplined while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases, according to the Party's disciplinary commission. State media has cited the trial and conviction last year of former high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- though called politically motivated by Bo supporters -- as one prime example of President Xi's determination to clean up the Party. 'Corruption endemic' Longtime China observers, however, point to the limits of President Xi's war on corruption. ""There have been public calls for a law to require officials disclosing their assets. There has been no indication that they are going to do that. In fact, a number of people calling for this law have ended up in prison,"" said Frank Ching, a Hong Kong-based commentator and columnist on Chinese politics. ""I think people will be much more convinced of the seriousness of this anti-corruption campaign if there were a move to enact such a law."" ""Corruption is so widespread and so endemic that campaigns are just not going do it,"" he added. ""Something has to be done about the system.""","Su Rong, former vice chairman of China's top political advisory body, removed from his post .

"(CNN)They came by the thousands -- in France and in Israel -- to cry, to honor and never to forget. Mourners on Tuesday remembered beloved sons and daughters who became terrorist targets in three attacks last week in France. They died at the hands of three Islamist extremists who tried to use religion to justify their slaughter. ""He was killed by false Muslims,"" said Malek Merabet, whose brother Ahmed -- also a Muslim -- was one of three French police officers killed in the attacks. ""One must not confuse extremists with Muslims. Mad people have neither color nor religion."" French authorities on Friday killed the three people directly behind the wave of terror. It began two days earlier with the massacre of 12 at the offices of the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine; continued Thursday with police officer Clarissa Jean-Philippe's slaying in the Paris suburb of Montrouge; and climaxed the next day with a hostage siege at a kosher grocery store that killed four. Since then, many around the globe have joined France in rallying against the Islamist terror threat. That spirit was evident Sunday in Paris when world leaders joined an estimated 1.5 million people marching in defiance of the killers and in solidarity with one another. But if Sunday was a day for unity, Tuesday was a day to grieve. That's what happened in Jerusalem, where Israeli leaders joined thousands to remember the four victims of the eastern Paris grocery store siege and to support their loved ones as they were buried. The four men -- Philippe Braham, Yohan Cohen, Yoav Hattab and François-Michel Saada -- were shot dead Friday. ""I'm crying,"" Braham's wife told the mourners. ""But I know that you all cry with me."" At a ceremony 2,000 miles away in Paris, French President François Hollande posthumously gave the Legion d'Honneur to Merabet, Jean-Philippe and Franck Brinsolaro, laying medals on the coffins of all three slain police officers. Merabet was buried later Tuesday, while the other two will be laid to rest in the coming days. ""They shared one desire: that of protecting their citizens,"" Hollande said. ""They had one ideal: that of serving the republic. They died in accomplishing their mission with courage, with bravery, with dignity. ""They died as police officers."" At Tuesday's ceremony, Hollande spoke about the three officers individually as well as their shared profession and values. Brinsolaro was a protection officer for Charlie Hebdo's editor, Stéphane Charbonnier, who was also killed Wednesday. ""He had become one of those policemen especially trained to ensure the safety, the security of people who are particularly vulnerable,"" Hollande said. And Jean-Philippe was responding to a traffic accident when she was killed by a gunman suspected in last week's terror attacks. ""She was cowardly shot in the back,"" Hollande said. ""How can one justify that one can kill so cowardly a young woman of 26 years of age, with all the future before her devoted to others?"" Hollande spoke of the ""wonderful future"" Merabet had ahead of him before his horrific death, which was caught on video -- with a gunman walking right up to him as he lay sprawled on the ground, then opening fire. Merabet was laid to rest at the Bobigny Islamic cemetery in a Paris suburb after a brief ceremony. Mourners applauded other police officers on hand and watched as Merabet's coffin -- draped in a French flag -- was carried to the grave site. One target of the terrorists -- Charlie Hebdo, the magazine -- will live on. ""There is a future,"" said Gerard Briard, the magazine's editor-in-chief, ""but we don't know yet what it will resemble. (But) there will be no interruption. In two weeks' time, there will be another edition of Charlie Hebdo."" The publication -- known for its provocative jabs at religion, politics, society and more -- went to the presses Tuesday for the first time since the attack. Three million copies will be printed, up from the usual 60,000, in several languages, including Arabic. The issue will hit newsstands Wednesday. This time, the cover features a drawing of a frowning Prophet Mohammed with a teardrop coming from his eye. ""All is Forgiven,"" the cover headline says in French. Charlie Hebdo puts Mohammed on its new cover . In the prophet's hands, a sign says, ""Je suis Charlie"" -- or ""I am Charlie,"" the phrase adopted around the world in protest of the attacks. The UK-based Ramadhan Foundation condemned such depictions of Mohammed as offensive to ""millions of Muslims around the world."" Yet cartoonist Renald Luzier told reporters Tuesday that the new edition's cover felt appropriate to him, adding that he cried after finishing it. ""I'm sorry that I've drawn him again, but the Mohammed that we've drawn"" is, above all, a Mohammed who is crying, said Luzier, who goes by the pen name Luz. Muslims worldwide have condemned last week's attacks on Charlie Hebdo and elsewhere in France. But al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the terror group's North Africa branch, is threatening more of them, according to a warning posted on jihadist websites. The group has battled French forces before in Africa. Many former French colonies are in that area, with Paris often coming to their support to fight against Islamist militants. More than 6,000 forces are involved in operations in and around Africa, according to Defense Ministry spokesman Sacha Mendel. ""France pays the cost of its violence on Muslim countries and the violation of their sanctity,"" the terror group said in a statement. ""As long as its soldiers occupy countries such as Mali and Central Africa and bombard our people in Syria and Iraq, and as long as its lame media continues to undermine our Prophet (Mohammed), France will expose itself to the worst and more."" France's National Assembly voted later Tuesday to extend airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. But before doing so, assembly members stood tall together, proudly singing France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise."" Among its lyrics, these timely words: ""Liberty, cherished liberty, fight alongside your defenders."" That fight is happening inside France, where, Mendel says, there will be more than 10,000 French troops deployed by Wednesday. And outside France, the battle against ISIS and al Qaeda is in full force in parts of the Middle East and beyond. Then there's the ongoing investigation and intelligence work, aimed at preventing future attacks and learning more about the latest one. Tracking down the assailants' contacts is also a priority for authorities. A French citizen admitted in court Tuesday that he knows one of the brothers blamed for the attack on Charlie Hebdo,  CNN affiliate TV7 Bulgaria reported. Bulgarian authorities first arrested Fritz-Joly Joachin near the country's border with Turkey on a warrant for allegedly kidnapping his son. Now, he also faces terrorism charges, and a French court has requested his extradition, the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. Bulgarian public prosecutor Darina Slavova told Agence France-Presse that the 29-year-old Joachin ""was in contact several times"" with Charlie Hebdo attacker Cherif Kouachi. According to AFP, the prosecutor said the charges against Joachin ""are for participation in an organized crime group whose aim was organization of terrorist acts.""

"With this year's goal for enrollment in Obamacare seemingly out of grasp and the President under renewed partisan attack over the program, an official key to implementing it has resigned. Gary Cohen leads the agency that made many of the rules for the Affordable Care Act and established the Marketplaces, where Americans can buy health insurance through Obamacare, including Healthcare.gov, according to a statement Wednesday announcing his departure. The Marketplaces came under fire, when they crashed massively upon rollout. Cohen will vacate the post of Director of the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight after March 31. That's the day open enrollment runs out, and with a goal of 6 million signups, the ACA has only 4 million on the books so far. February saw 700,000 new enrollments, and to meet its goal, Obamacare would have to garner a record monthly number of new enrollees. The agency statement did not mention a reason for Cohen's departure but indicated that family matters may have something to do with it. He will be replaced by physician Mandy Cohen, who is currently serving in another leadership position at the CCIIO. A Republican lawmaker latched onto data from a recently released ACA report to beat up Obama once more. Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Missouri, cited a ""quietly-released report"" from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency over the CCIIO, that claimed 11 million people would face higher premiums because of the healthcare law. The CCIIO is also responsible for implementing measures concerning private health insurance. Wagner repeated past accusations that Obama mislead the public over ACA's costs. ""It's another slap in the face to our already hurting middle class,"" she said. Obama countered, saying that, despite the ""disruptions"" in the ACA's rollout - including the much-maligned website debacle - the law is a success. The President also said that the Republican fixation on blockading the law's progress bordered on farce. House passes 50th bill to undo Obamacare .

"A judge's ruling that the city of Detroit can move forward with bankruptcy and strip the city's public workers of their modest pension benefits will have a devastating impact on Detroit's middle class — many of whom are African-American — and the city's ability to rebuild a strong and sustainable economy. The largest municipal bankruptcy in our nation's history, the Detroit decision charts a course where Wall Street banks and bondholders are at the front of the payment line while city residents, police officers, firefighters and other public employees are left at the rear, with only pennies. Kevyn Orr, Detroit's unelected emergency manager, misled the public and succeeded in setting a dangerous precedent that will have ripple effects for other cities and states still struggling to get back on their feet in the post-recession economy. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder and Orr, a former corporate bankruptcy lawyer, frequently cited the figure of Detroit's $18 billion in long-term debt as the reason the city must declare bankruptcy. According to a recent report, ""The Detroit Bankruptcy,"" written by former Goldman Sachs investment banker Wallace Turbeville, not only is $18 billion an inflated and inaccurate estimation of Detroit's long-term debt, it is irrelevant. Unlike corporations, cities cannot be liquidated, therefore cash flow, as opposed to long-term debt, is what must be addressed. Opinion: Detroit, the 'used to be' city . Detroit has a cash-flow shortfall of $198 million. Despite the blame placed on public pensions, the truth is that Detroit's path to insolvency had little or nothing to do with pensions, which average just $19,000 per year for most employees and $30,000 per year for police and firefighters, who are not eligible to receive Social Security. There were several drivers of Detroit's downward spiral: . A depleted tax base: The city's wealthier white population has declined by 1.4 million since the 1950s, leaving behind an almost entirely African-American and much poorer population. The remaining tax base continues to decline as unemployment stays stubbornly high: In 2008 alone, the number of working Detroit residents dropped by roughly one-quarter, further diminishing the city's income tax receipts. Property tax revenue also dropped precipitously as home values went through the floor. Skyrocketing financial costs: Wall Street banks saddled Detroit with $1.6 billion in loan deals that were highly profitable for Wall Street, but exposed the city to risk it could not afford to take. The banks have already extracted $300 million from Detroit to terminate these interest rate swaps, and are posed to collect another $300 million in additional windfalls. Corporate subsidies and tax loopholes: While public workers were laid off and had salaries cut, Detroit gave away millions of public revenue in tax loopholes and subsidies to big corporations. A wealth of research finds that tax breaks like these are ineffective and it is apparent they have done little to create good jobs for Detroit residents. These tax breaks should be on the table, just like other obligations of the city in resolving the cash-flow crisis. The dynamics at play in Detroit are the same dynamics creating the growing wealth gap and keeping our economy from making a lasting and sustainable economic recovery. While Wall Street and corporations profit handsomely from a city's decline, public workers—the city's middle class—have sacrificed time and again. In recent years, thousands of public workers were laid off, and the remaining public employees accepted a 10% pay cut, health benefit reductions and a 40% cut in future pension benefits, saving Detroit $160 million. Not only is it immoral to force the working people to give up even more in the name of fiscal responsibility, but these cuts will only burden the effort to solve the city's long-term challenges by depressing economic activity, pushing more residents into poverty, and making it difficult to retain and attract needed workers. Instead, Detroit's cash flow shortfall must be addressed by fixing the problems that caused it in the first place. Banks must be told that they have profited enough from interest rate swaps that helped create this mess and will receive no more. The state needs to collaborate by increasing available revenues. Corporate tax loopholes must be closed and ineffective subsidies ended.

"Cape Cod, Massachusetts (CNN) -- When coming face to face with the monstrous jaws of a great white shark, you'd probably want to be armed with more than a wet towel. It seems almost insane to think placing a dark cloth over the formidable killer's eyes will help calm it down for long enough to attach electronic tags, take blood samples, and even conduct an ultrasound. But in the space of just 15 minutes, a towel is one of the tools used to placate the fearsome creature while a team of researchers carry out important investigations into its mysterious living habits. This is Ocearch in action -- a group of gutsy scientists and sailors traveling the high seas on their 38-meter floating laboratory, as part of a mission to tag and monitor an ancient animal we know surprisingly little about. Watch more: Ocearch scientists tag great white . ""We don't know much about the great white shark's natural history, its ecology from day to day, how it lives and interacts with its environment,"" said Greg Skomal, chief fisheries scientist on board Ocearch. ""But when you come onto this vessel and you have a live animal in front of you that you can study, it just opens new doors -- you can get a more robust assessment in a very short period of time."" 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' Just a few kilometers from where Steven Spielberg filmed his 1975 Hollywood blockbuster, ""Jaws,"" the Ocearch team is also on the lookout for sharks. Cruising along the Cape Cod coastline in Massachusetts, they lure the predators with mashed-up herrings, tuna, and a dummy in the shape of a seal. Previously used to catch crabs, the converted Ocearch vessel features a hydraulic lift -- much like a giant cradle -- to lift the great whites out of the sea. It's up to captain Brett McBride to jump in the water and guide the sharks onto the platform, making sure to leave a good 10 meters between himself and the carnivores, which can grow up to six meters long. ""As soon as we bring them on the platform the first thing I do is cover their eyes with a dark, wet towel and that usually calms them right down,"" said McBride. ""Then I will take two hoses with a lot of volume of water and make sure that it's nice, clean seawater with bubbles in it that will cascade down each side of the gills."" Pit stop science . The scientists then have 15 minutes to bolt a satellite tracking tag to the fin, insert another acoustic tag in the abdomen, attach a third tag monitoring scale movements and tail beats, take blood and tissue samples, and even conduct an ultrasound. The whole operation has the appearance of an F1 racing car pit stop, with researchers crouched on either side and hurriedly attaching $10,000-worth of high-tech equipment, expected to last around five years. Since launching in 2007, the team has tagged over 60 great whites, helping to build a global map of shark migration. Scientists first started tagging the mysterious creature in the 1960s, often using a harpoon to attach a GPS device. Around 500 great whites have since been tagged around the world, revealing fascinating glimpses into their movements through the world's oceans. One of the greatest distances ever recorded was that of a great white traveling from South Africa to Australia in 99 days -- a distance of 11,100 kilometers. ""What we have found is that male (great white) sharks are all living along the beach all the time -- they have very little off-shore life,"" said Ocearch expedition leader Chris Fischer, whose team has researched great white movements off southern Africa. ""But the females go way out over Madagascar, and even out into the middle of the Indian Ocean, and they hang around out there for months and months. What are they doing out there? Are they gestating their babies? Are they feeding?"" Time to act . It's exactly these questions that push the team to quite literally dive in the deep end with the terrifying -- and captivating -- animals. ""Shark populations worldwide are under threat -- sharks are being slaughtered at an unsustainable rate, many for a bowl of soup,"" said Fischer. ""This unsustainable harvest rate is driven by the demand for shark fins, meat and other products, and puts not only sharks at risk, but also the entire balance of the ocean."" Ocearch gives a name to each shark it tags -- from Katherine, to Curly, and Junior -- in an effort to build people's relationships with them and reflect their unique personalities. ""Katherine will travel 1,000 miles (1,609 kilometers) a month -- she will visit Bermuda, she will travel down the southeast coast, she will go to places we don't understand,"" said Fischer of one of the sharks. ""This project is about solving the annual movements of the great white shark around the north Atlantic -- it's a 450-million-year mystery and today everyone gets to watch it unfold in real time.""","Meet Ocearch, a gutsy team of scientists and sailors examining sharks close-up .

"Hollywood's ongoing enchantment with politics continues with yet another political TV show; CBS' upcoming ""Madam Secretary."" The show tested the D.C. waters Thursday night with inside-the-Beltway's media and political elites at a screening at the spacious U.S. Institute for Peace, aptly situated across the street from the real State Department. ""No, this show has nothing to do with Hillary or Madeleine or Condoleezza Rice or anybody else we know,"" said actor Morgan Freeman on the Institute of Peace red carpet. ""It's fiction. We made it all up and we will continue to make it up.""  Freeman's production studio Revelations Entertainment is spearheading the project. They might be making it up, but they clearly borrowed a little inspiration from real-life current events. In the premier episode, Syria as a political flashpoint, social media sabotaging negotiation efforts, the 24-hour news cycle eating away at every staged move, women's roles in leadership, and the inability for ""Madam Secretary"" to ""have it all."" There's also the requisite mix of sex and comedic relief in typical Hollywood (and D.C.) fashion. Former Madam Secretary Madeleine Albright attended the premiere, sitting next to CBS' Bob Scheiffer who made a cameo in the premiere episode. CNN's Jake Tapper, NBC's Andrea Mitchell, Politico's Maggie Haberman, and Hillary Clinton's right-hand woman Huma Abedin were all in attendance. There have been two women secretaries of state since Albright served under President Bill Clinton -- Rice and Hillary Clinton -- which means women have made strides with leading roles in two male dominated industries -- politics and TV. There has been a surge in female-centered shows about the nation's capitol. Think ""Scandal,"" ""Homeland"" and ""Veep."" Leading lady Téa Leoni looked every bit the part of her on-air persona of Madam Secretary in a slim blazer-pants combo that put other pant suits in the crowd to shame as she fielded questions and picture requests. Actor Erich Bergen, who plays Leoni's comedic lap-dog assistant on the show, weighed in on the L.A. obsession with D.C. ""It's already addicting. Before it was on television portrayed fictionally, we were all news junkies, we were all interested in what was going on. I think it's naturally drama -- it's like a hospital, it's like a law firm, anything that has natural drama built in. ""We all think we know the U.S. government, we all think we know how it works. We all think we know what happens. We obviously don't, so this sort of gives us fulfills our need to see what's going on inside there."" The premise and especially the premiere episode follow the formula set forth by other television dramas like ""Homeland"": two young men are being dragged through a dank prison, a cacophony of Arabic filling the air. Cut to the lofty campus of University of Virginia, where protagonist Elizabeth McCord leads a leisurely life as a professor. Jump to an untimely demise of the secretary of state that thrusts her into the national spotlight after the President personally begs her to fill the role. The show takes off from there, navigating the hallowed halls of Capitol Hill and the State Department.","CBS debuts a new show Sunday night about a female secretary of state .

"Album sales are at an all-time low in the United States. Vinyl sales are at their highest for 15 years. Everybody says streaming is the future, yet major artists are pulling out of streaming services. And in tech-oriented Japan, CDs still account for 85% of album sales. The current state of the music industry is anyone's guess. Spotify . Technology is transforming the way music is created, shared and enjoyed, and where we will go from here is hard to predict. The latest shock to the system is Taylor Swift's decision to break up with Spotify, the popular music streaming service that has 40 million active users -- one quarter of which are paying subscribers. With the release of her latest album, entitled ""1989,"" Swift -- arguably music's most popular artist at the moment -- requested that all her back catalog be removed from the service. The move, which would be risky for most other artists, helped boost sales of the album to 1.3 million units in its debut week, the best performance in the industry since 2002. With no legal option other than buying, fans obliged. Spotify says that over 70% of its revenues go to artists, but just between $0.006 and $0.0084 is paid for each play, depending on the artist. Others before Swift have pulled out: Thom Yorke famously described the service as ""the last desperate fart of a dying corpse,"" and his solo works are not available for streaming. Other no-shows include The Beatles, who have an exclusive deal with Apple. And yet, Spotify is now earning some artists more money than iTunes in Europe, as was revealed at the Web Summit technology conference in Dublin by Willard Ahdritz, CEO and founder of Kobalt, a company that represents thousands of musicians. That means that streaming is becoming, in some instances, more profitable than album sales. Predicting the hits . Elsewhere in the digital world, social media is becoming a dominant contributing factor to the popularity of an artist, and it's also generating a huge amount of data that can be a powerful tool for trend analysis. Public social data is like a crystal ball that can help the music industry predict who's going to become the next big thing. A company called Next Big Sound specializes in precisely these types of predictions. By tracking streams and collecting data from the Internet -- new Twitter followers, Facebook likes and Wikipedia page views -- the company says it can estimate the likelihood of an artist making it into the Billboard Top 200, which charts album releases, over a year before it happens. Making the charts is not easy. Speaking at the Web Summit, Alex White of Next Big Sound pointed out that in the last year, only 961 artists made the Billboard Top 200, and just 204 of those were entering it for the first time. The Billboard Top 100, which tracks singles rather than albums, is an even more exclusive club: out of 249 artists appearing, just 43 were debuting. Despite the charts favoring established artists, it's never been so easy to make, share and discover new music. ""At the end of the 90s you needed a full blown musical studio to make real music,"" said Eric Wahlforss, co-founder of streaming service Soundcloud, ""now all you need is a laptop. Even an iPad can be enough. Music making is for everyone. Technology has made it cheaper, accessible and more powerful."" Soundcloud was launched in 2007 and allows users to upload their music and embed it anywhere, offering a powerful tool for discovery. It has evolved significantly over the years, skewing its balance in favor of listeners and introducing algorithms that spot protected material. ""We care a lot about copyrights and we have automatic filters that can block content on behalf of copyright holders,"" said Wahlforss. ""We want to go to a billion monthly listeners, and welcoming major labels is a key point of the journey there."" The service, which currently boasts 175 million monthly listeners, has just announced a licensing deal with Warner Music, and is introducing a paid subscription model next year. ""If you have those numbers, naturally you want to generate revenue, and that's what we're focusing on at the moment,"" said Wahlforss. A matter of taste . Even though music discovery has evolved rapidly in recent years, there is still no consensus on which technology is the best to analyze someone's musical taste. According to Kevin Lee, who was among the founders of the Beats headphones brand, we might need to start from scratch. ""Even with all this music, at any given time I still only have about five to 10 songs that I love and listen to, but I have to believe there may be 100 that would really touch me in the same way,"" he said. ""I feel we need a new technology that can figure that out."" Lee now heads Sol Republic, a rising brand of audio products, and thinks that in the future we'll have headphones capable of analyzing a user's emotional response to a song, and then suggesting something similar. ""It takes three seconds for you to know whether you like a song or not. There's something about our ears and our body and our mind that figures that out so quickly, and we need to find a technology that can do that for us,"" he said. Apple bought Beats earlier this year for $3 billion, in a strong statement about the significance of headphones in this industry: because we listen to so much music through our phones, hidden away in our pockets, it's what's on our heads that counts. But Lee thinks that headphones have become too ubiquitous. ""I hope people will discover this thing called the speaker,"" he said. ""Right now you need a large, expensive speaker to get good sound, but we had the same problem with headphones and we solved that. I'm confident that we'll manage to shrink speakers in size without compromising sound quality: when we figure that out, people will change the way they listen to music at home."" One thing, however, does seem likely: ""Streaming is the way of the future,"" said Soundcloud's Eric Wahlforss. At the end of the Web Summit, sharing the stage with the final panelists, U2's Bono joined the discussion, defending Spotify's royalty model, and arguing that streaming is, indeed, what lies ahead, even amid the many uncertainties. ""The remunerative bit still has to be figured out,"" he said. ""This is an experimental and exciting period. So, let's experiment and see what works.""

"Malaysia's highest court has rejected a challenge from the Catholic Church seeking to overturn a ban on non-Muslims using the word ""Allah"" to refer to God. But after the Federal Court announced its verdict on Monday, the government released a statement saying that the ruling would only apply to the Church's newspaper, which has been at the center of the court battle since Malaysian authorities ordered the publication to cease using the Arabic word in 2007. Malaysian Christians will still be able to use the word ""Allah"" in church, the government's statement said. ""Malaysia is a multi-faith country and it is important that we manage our differences peacefully, in accordance with the rule of law and through dialogue, mutual respect and compromise,"" the statement said. Confusion . The conflicting interpretations of the ban have only added confusion to a debate that has inflamed religious tensions in the Muslim-majority country in recent years. The editor of the the newspaper, the Herald, said it remains unclear what the implications of the court's verdict would be for the Christian community. ""We are in limbo,"" Father Lawrence Andrew told CNN. But the chairman of the Christian Federation of Malaysia, Reverend Eu Hong Seng, said in a statement that Christians will continue to use the word ""Allah"" in bibles and during church gatherings. The dispute began in 2007 when the Malaysian Ministry of Home Affairs, which grants publishing licenses, threatened to withdraw the Herald's permit for using the Arabic word in its Malay-language edition, on the grounds of national security and public order. Malaysian authorities say non-Muslim literature that contains the word could confuse Muslims and cause them to convert away from Islam, which is a crime in many parts of the country. Christian leaders argue that the word ""Allah"" predates Islam, and has long been used in Malay-language bibles and other texts to refer to God. Anti-Christian violence . The dispute has sparked violence in recent years against Malaysia's Christian community, which accounts for around 9% of the country's population of 29 million, while more than 60% are Muslim. A series of fire bomb attacks were carried out on places of worship after a court ruled in 2009 that the Church had a constitutional right to refer to God as ""Allah"" in the Herald. But an appeals court reinstated the ban in October 2013. Three months later, arsonists set fire to a church in Kuala Lumpur, and Islamic authorities confiscated hundreds of bibles containing the word ""Allah"" from a Christian organization in the state of Selangor. On Monday, a panel of judges at the Federal Court in Putrajaya ruled 4 to 3 that the word was not an integral part of the Christian faith, upholding the decision of the appeals court. Outside the building, hundreds of Muslim activists celebrated the verdict, shouting ""Allahuakbar"" (God is great). ""We thank Allah because the court's decision has favored us this time. We hope that this is no longer an issue in the peninsular, which does not allow others (to use) the term,"" the head of Perkasa, a conservative Muslim rights group, told reporters. Father Andrew from the Herald said the Church was looking into ways to challenge the ban. ""We need to fight this case to end, because we have to fight for justice when justice is derided or denied,"" he said. ""We have a moral obligation to champion the cause of minorities. We have a responsibility to uphold religious freedom."" Politics . It's likely that the ban is politically motivated, according to William Case, a political scientist with the City University of Hong Kong's Department of Asian and International Studies. Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak is a reformist to some extent, says Case, but his party failed to win a majority in the last election and he needs to recapture the support of the country's ethnic Malay, and mostly Muslim, community. However, it's too soon to tell how the Malaysian government will implement the ban in practice, he says. ""This is the kind of ambiguity you would expect, because it's a very complex and tense set of circumstances. You might have the judiciary saying one thing, the cabinet saying another -- meanwhile pressure is mounting from the many Muslim groups involved who bring tremendous mass-based support, and on the other side from Christian groups."" The ruling may lead to further attacks on churches, Case warned. ""We do know that Malaysia has become more and more polarized in recent years on ethnic, and increasingly religious, grounds -- and that's becoming more and more severe."" But while the latest court ruling is distressing, Case says verbal threats against religious groups in Malaysia seldom translate into the kind of violence seen in neighboring countries, like Indonesia. ""We don't see extrajudicial killings, religious-inspired violence and abductions, and that distinguishes Malaysia in the region."" In 2013: Christian churches in Borneo vow to continue using the word 'Allah' Sudanese Christian woman rearrested, legal team says .","Malaysia's top court dismisses bid to overturn ban on Christians using Arabic word for God .

"All the elements were there for low turnout: It was a beautiful, cloudless night,  the Iowa-Iowa State game had just ended, and the state's critical place in presidential politics still felt years away for most Iowans. But on Saturday night in Dubuque, Iowa, roughly 130 people showed up to see Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont talk about elevating the middle class, nationalizing health care and fighting the degrading influence of money in politics. And they didn't just listen -- they urged him to run for president in 2016. ""We need a political revolution in this country,"" Sanders said, to applause. ""Politics is terribly important, and what happens in Washington and state capitals is also enormously important."" A largely older, markedly liberal audience listened to Sanders for over an hour inside the student center of the local university. Before the event started, attendees chatted about the senator coming to Dubuque and whether he was going to run for president. Many said they hoped so, mostly because they want a liberal option in the Democratic primary in 2016. ""Everything he says speaks to me about who I am as an American, as a voter, as a middle-class voter,"" said Ann Bodnar-Donovan, who sat in the front row at the event. Others echoed her sentiment. Sanders did not actually mention his presidential aspirations from the dais, but his event in Iowa -- along with town halls in Waterloo and Des Moines on Sunday -- made it clear that he is toying with a bid. The final steak fry: Honoring Harkin with a large helping of politics . Sanders told CNN earlier last week that he was thinking about a run and was traveling to Iowa to ""find out what kind of support there is for a progressive agenda."" He won't say whether he would run as an Independent or a Democrat, but his supporters in Iowa clearly wanted him to run as a liberal Democrat. Sanders was not the only potential 2016 candidate in Iowa this weekend. Hillary Clinton, the prohibitive front-runner for the nomination if she chooses to run, is headlining the Harkin Steak Fry in Des Moines on Sunday. It is her first event in the Hawkeye State in over six years. Clinton's and Sanders' events couldn't be more different. The former secretary of state will speak to more than 5,000 people at an idyllic field south of Des Moines. Signs adorn every corner of the event, which will see over 2,500 pounds of steak grilled and served. The only signage for Sanders' event was a small piece of cardboard in front of the building that read ""Bernie Sanders."" But Sanders is benefiting from Clinton. People at his event liked the fact he was courting Iowa despite Clinton's front-runner status and was willing to stand up and possibly challenge her from the left. ""I think the Democratic party needs to move a little bit to the liberal, progressive side,"" said Marcos Rubinstein, who organized Dennis Kucinich's 2008 Iowa campaign. ""I want to hear him. Of course I like him, I know his history."" Before his speech, Sanders reflected on the third beheading of a Western individual by ISIS and President Barack Obama's authorization of military strikes in Syria. ""Clearly ISIS is a terrorist organization, a brutal organization, a dangerous organization,"" Sanders told CNN, before he quickly turned to a topic he is more comfortable about: the middle class and the economy. ""In the midst of dealing with ISIS, it is absolutely imperative that we not ignore the huge problems facing the middle class and working families of this country."" The senator did devote a great deal of his speech to speaking about the future of the United States, including outlining a plan he called the ""Agenda for America."" His first point was the most well-received: ""We have got to restore the democracy to the United States of America by overturning this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision. ... I do not believe that people fought and died for democracy so that billionaires can buy elections."" Sanders has become a champion of overturning the 2010 Citizens United ruling, which opened the floodgates for outside money in politics and ballooned the amount spent on campaigns. He spent the last week arguing as much from the Senate floor. On health care, Sanders added that ""the United States of America needs to join with the rest of the industrialized world and have a nationalized health care."" Sanders ended his speech with a call to action, urging attendees to begin a conversation and organize support in northeast Iowa for the issues he was addressing. ""Our job is to educate, is to organize, is to go outside our zone of comfort,"" he said. ""We need to build coalitions."" Clinton tops Democrats in Iowa while Huckabee leads Republicans .

"From parent to son, uncle to nephew, grandparent to grandson, there's a raw, private conversation being re-energized in America in the wake of violence in Ferguson, Missouri. It's an intimate lecture that most Americans won't know, but parents like Kelli Knox of Southern California know it too well because it begins the loss of their children's innocence and exposes them to a painful national truth that's increasingly become a matter of life or death. As challenging as parenting is, black families in particular are assuming more burdens: At kitchen tables and in living rooms, they hold honest talks with their boys about how life can be different for them and what they ought -- and ought not -- to do in public, especially near police. Think twice about wearing a hoodie. Pull up your pants. Shut your mouth around police. Swallow your pride. Don't drive with more than three friends. And keep your hands where they can be seen. These are just a few examples of the rules that parents tell their young black sons -- and sometimes daughters -- about how to stay safe. Though stark and blunt, the admonishments follow a trend of violence that touches upon the most fiery issue in America: race. The 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, the 2013 police shooting of a North Carolina man who was apparently seeking only help and this week's riots against Ferguson police -- these sensational cases all involve shooting victims who were unarmed, young black men. My son knows he could be Trayvon . ""I've had this conversation with my son since middle school on how to behave,"" said Knox, 46, of Inglewood, California. ""When the police come, this is what you do. This is how you speak to them. Do not get into a power struggle. Listen to them. If they are trying to give you a ticket, get the ticket. Because it's not worth it. It's just not worth it."" A 'sad' day and time . Whether at reunions, picnics, or the mall, families and friends make it a point to apprise sons, nephews or grandsons of what Knox calls ""the rules of engagement"" for young black men when they encounter police or other figures of authorities. Robert Spicer tells his eldest child, Crishawn, 15, to be aware of even how he dresses. ""I stress to him his appearance is important, the way he conducts himself, the way he talks to people,"" said Spicer, 44, a tow truck driver who lives Los Angeles. His wife, Lashon, 42, said the California couple worry about their four children every day. ""You don't know what's going to happen between dropping them off and them coming home,"" she said. Brent Paysinger, a Church of God in Christ pastor in south Los Angeles, and his wife, Andrea, constantly urge caution with son Isaiah, 15. ""Basically you have to separate yourself in this day and time. It's sad but it's true. They profile you just by first appearances,"" Andrea Paysinger said. Such talks have taken on greater urgency in the wake of the Ferguson police shooting and killing of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown last week, one expert said. Witnesses say Brown was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot. The hashtags #IGotTheTalk and #IGaveTheTalk trended on Twitter this week, with parents and children sharing on social media when they had such tough conversations. ""Here we go again"" was the reaction of education expert Steve Perry about the Ferguson incident. ""We have another instance in what an African-American man loses his life because of something that seems like it went awry,"" Perry said. As a principal of a nationally recognized magnet school in Connecticut and an African-American father, Perry said it's important for parents to explain to youths the expediency of just getting home safely. ""If you have a black son, and you're not taking the time to explain to him what he needs to do when he's out in the streets, how he needs to dress and how he needs to act and explain to him that he actually does have a target on his back -- then you are not doing your job as a parent,"" Perry said. Other experts say other minority families should hold such a talk with their children. ""The bottom line is we are living in a post-Trayvon Martin, post-Zimmerman trial world, and any parent of color -- Latino or African-American parent -- must have these conversations with their children. It is just really reality,"" said Sonny Hostin, a former federal prosecutor and legal commentator. ""It is the same conversation I think that many parents have about stranger danger; the same conversation that parents have with their children about look both ways before you cross the street."" A case study . Perry recalled how he, too, was racially profiled by police. He offered the account as a case study in how black youths should respond in such scenarios. ""When the police pull you over, you have to do everything you can do to mitigate the situation to lower the level to just get home,"" Perry said. ""I've been in that situation myself. I was riding home with my wife and kids and I had a hoodie on and I guess I was driving something nice, that I shouldn't have been driving faster than the police thought I should've been driving, and I was pulled over and the police officer got real slick. He said some things to me that I thought were completely inappropriate. ""I said absolutely nothing. I looked forward. I made no fast movements.  I did everything I could to just get my family home,"" Perry said. Perry later complained to the officer's boss and received a written apology, he said. Perry blamed a broad trend for the way young black men are treated. ""Black males are criminalized from the time we enter the 'system,' and I'm talking about school,"" Perry said. ""From the time children enter the system, African-American males are the most suspended, most punished of any group. Period."" How children react . The guidance can be difficult for youngsters to swallow. ""I think sometimes I am an African-American man, young man, why should I be afraid to walk down the street and get discriminated against because of the color I am, or the way I am dressed or the way I look?"" said Crishawn Spicer, 15. Not too surprisingly, the boys may not fully appreciate their parents' caution. Sometimes, they accept it sheepishly. ""My parents really care about me. That's what they are there for,"" said Isaiah Paysinger, 15. ""Some stuff, me being a teenager, I think they are too overbearing on, but this is for my safety. And with this whole situation, the young man who got killed, I see why."" Knox's son, Joseph, who's now 26, declined to be interviewed by CNN at first. The subject was too emotional, and he suggested that sometimes his mother may be worrying too much. Then he changed his mind about the interview. ""I think she has a right to worry. She's a little bit too worried, but I don't blame her,"" Joseph Knox said. Trim, athletic, sporting a type of goatee known as the balbo, Joseph Knox said he is a law-abiding working professional. He's a technician in the hyperbaric chamber at the University of California, Los Angeles. The parental talks, he now says, are ""very necessary."" ""I don't look like trouble. I don't dress like it. I went to college and graduated, and I still have problems like the next kid,"" Joseph Knox said. In one example, he was outside his house with his girlfriend when police asked him what he was doing. ""I'm clearly talking to my girlfriend and he says, 'Why don't you go crip walk back up into your house,'"" he said. He said nothing, though his initial response was to ""go back and forth with him,"" he said. ""They want to provoke you but ... my mom and my family told me and taught me how to deal with them,"" Joseph Knox said. ""A kid who maybe didn't have the same kind of family, he's going to go argue with the police like it was the next man and that's where trouble comes. ""It helps to have parents or family to give you an education on how to deal with that stuff,"" Joseph Knox said.","The Ferguson, Missouri, riots renew painful talks parents give young sons .

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a former U.S. attorney, said he had no qualms about a possible lawsuit from the recently quarantined nurse in his state. Campaigning Tuesday in Rhode Island for GOP gubernatorial nominee Allan Fung, the straight-talking Republican also hit back at criticism that the nurse wasn't treated well enough, arguing she even had internet access and takeout food. ""Whatever,"" he said, when pressed by reporters about a potential legal challenge. ""Get in line. I've been sued lots of times before. Get in line. I'm happy to take it on."" Obama strikes back at Christie on Ebola . Kaci Hickox, a health care worker who returned last week from helping Ebola victims in Sierra Leone, was isolated over the weekend in a tent inside a Newark hospital. Saying she was not symptomatic, she strongly protested the quarantine, hiring legal counsel and drawing the national spotlight to what she described as a violation against her rights. She was released and sent to Maine on Monday. Attorneys for Hickox have raised the possibility of challenging New Jersey's quarantine policy in court. Christie on Ebola policy: 'We're not moving an inch' Facing questions over the condition of tent, Christie said he had no concerns about how she was treated. ""Neither did the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], who was on the ground in University Hospital monitoring the conditions she was in. She had access to the internet and we brought her takeout food."" Ebola outbreak: Get up to speed . Christie understood why she felt inconvenienced, he said, but argued she had a fever at one point and he did what was right for the general public. ""There's been all kinds of malarkey ... about this. She was inside the hospital in a climate-controlled area with access to her cell phone, access to the internet, and takeout food from the best restaurants in Newark. She was doing just fine.""","Chris Christie brushed off questions about a potential lawsuit over his handling of Ebola .

"One of the world's most successful innovators and philanthropists defended the U.S. response to the deadly Ebola epidemic Monday, saying he doesn't think the government waited too long to act. Bill Gates, speaking at a discussion hosted by the website Politico, said he was thrilled when President Barack Obama decided to invest resources in containing the virus as it threatened to spread from West Africa into other regions and continents. ""Was there some other government who took decisive action before we did? Was the data really clear?"" Gates asked during the discussion. ""Is there someone else who's research is going to give us the vaccine that will be the key to making sure this outbreak doesn't happen again? The U.S. is the leader on being able to move into areas like this and help out."" The Microsoft billionaire, listed as the richest American by Forbes magazine, is co-chair along with his wife of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The two have tasked the foundation with battling the spread of polio and malaria as well as Ebola. Gates did acknowledge that it took time for countries and leaders to realize the seriousness of this particular outbreak. However, he sounded confident that the situation will be handled effectively. ""Ebola isn't going to get to the level of something like malaria or an HIV, because I do think we're stepping up and will respond,"" Gates said. Gates praised U.S. ability to handle the logistics of such a large emergency operation -- by moving resources and medical workers in and out of the region quickly and efficiently. ""The U.S., as usual on world problems, is stepping up in terms of the science, the understanding and the U.S. military's logistic ability to get supplies in and build hospitals that are critical,"" Gates said. The discussion, held in Washington just a block away from the White House with a sweeping view of the National Mall, also turned to political gridlock in Congress. Gates said the gridlock was concerning as it led to a Congress that failed to tackle immigration reform and allowed investment in energy and medical research to tail off. However, he also underscored that the United States has historically found bipartisan consensus on global health issues. Gates argues that the simple principle of treating all lives as equal, no matter where people live, is essential. ""Of all the dollars spent by the U.S. government, the most impactful are these global health dollars. More lives have been saved and improved per dollar by a huge amount."" Even as Gates remains optimistic about the U.S. government and its ability to help people, you won't see him donating millions to a political candidate any time soon. When it comes to changing the world, Gates explained, he tends to stay away from politics. ""I don't think my backing, putting a lot of money into political contributions, is a way I'm going to try and improve the world,"" Gates said. ""I just don't chose to pour money into that type of vehicle."" However, that's not say he doesn't appreciate strong leadership. Gates said one of the leaders he admires most in the world is the late Nelson Mandela. ""Mandela told people something they didn't expect to hear from him, which was that revenge and evening the score of how they'd been treated was not in their interest,"" Gates said. ""The country had to move forward, had to embrace everyone who lived there, the economy had to lift everyone up."" Gates also commented on the culture of innovation in the U.S. and Silicon Valley in particular. He said that even as tech companies focus on seemingly superficial problems such as hailing a taxi or counting calories, the digital revolution created tools that transformed philanthropy and nonprofit work around the world. ""We are getting more and more people participating, and the very tools of the digital revolution, the ability to share things on the Internet and share large amounts of data, those tools are absolutely phenomenal,"" Gates said. ""When you have this glum mood that people are in, they don't see that innovation is actually moving faster today than ever before.""","Bill Gates: I was thrilled when President Obama invested resources in containing Ebola .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Coalition troops killed the al Qaeda terrorist who masterminded the February 2006 attack on Samarra's al-Askariya mosque and set off continuing violence and reprisal killings between Sunnis and Shiites, the U.S. military said Sunday. The attack on Samarra's al-Askariya mosque set off violence between Sunnis and Shiites. Haitham Sabah al-Badri, the al Qaeda emir of greater Samarra, was killed by an airstrike Thursday east of Samarra, said Rear Adm. Mark Fox during a news conference. ""Eliminating al-Badri is another step in breaking the cycle of violence instigated by the attack on the holy shrine in Samarra,"" Fox said. ""We will continue to hunt down the brutal terrorists who are intent on creating a Taliban-like state in Iraq."" Coalition forces Thursday raided four buildings outside Samarra that were associated with al-Badri, according to a U.S. military news release. During the raid, at least four armed men were seen leaving the buildings and setting up tactical fighting positions in an effort to ambush coalition forces, the release said. The coalition forces called in close air support, killing al-Badri and the three others, the release said. One of those killed was identified as a foreigner; al-Badri was identified by his close associates and relatives, the military said. El-Badri's death was first reported Saturday by a high-ranking Iraqi Interior Ministry official. No one was injured in the attack on the Golden Mosque, one of the holiest Shiite sites, but thousands have been killed by the death squads and reprisal bombings that have ravaged Iraq in the 17½ months since the attack. In addition to the February attack that collapsed the mosque's dome, another bombing in June destroyed the shrine's two remaining minarets. Al-Badri is believed to have been involved in other attacks, including two last year, Fox said -- the June 23 bombing of a Kirkuk courthouse that left 20 Iraqis dead and the August 28 attack at a Samarra checkpoint that killed 29 Iraqi soldiers. Samarra is in Salaheddin province, north of Baghdad. Mortar attacks kill 11 . Two mortar rounds struck a gas station in a mainly Shiite neighborhood in eastern Baghdad on Sunday, killing at least 11 people and wounding 15 others, a spokesman with Iraq's Interior Ministry said. The attack in the Afdhailiya neighborhood happened about 8 a.m. (12 a.m. ET), the spokesman said. Suicide bombers attacked two gas stations Wednesday, killing 70 people, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, coalition forces said Saturday they killed four suspected militants and detained 18 thought to have helped make or plant roadside bombs, the U.S. military said. The militants were suspected of coordinating logistical support from Iran for elements of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and other Shiite militias operating in Iraq, the military said. Iraqi family upset with U.S. soldier's sentence . A U.S. soldier has been sentenced to 110 years in confinement for participating in the rape of a 14-year-old girl and the killings of her and her family in Iraq, an Army spokeswoman said. The girl's family told Reuters on Sunday they were dismayed by the punishment and would have preferred to see the death penalty handed down in the case. Pfc. Jesse Spielman was convicted Friday of rape, conspiracy to commit rape, housebreaking with the intent to commit rape and four counts of felony murder. The girl, her parents and younger sister were shot dead in March 2006 in Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. ""We were expecting the death penalty against those criminals and the place to carry out the sentence is where the incident happened,"" the girl's cousin, Abu Ammar, told Reuters. Her uncle, Hadi Abdullah, told the wire agency that family members wished there was a way to appeal the sentence so the death penalty could be imposed. Three soldiers have previously pleaded guilty in the case and were given sentences ranging from five to 100 years. The accused ringleader, former Pvt. Steven Green, was discharged from the Army and awaits trial in a civilian court. Other developments .

"(CNN)Joni Ernst has spent less than a week in Washington, but she's making it clear that she doesn't intend to forget her roots: in this case, hogs and Harleys. Ernst's political action committee, the Jobs, Opportunity and New Ideas or JONI PAC, has sent out a save-the-date for what is certain to become one of the premiere political events in Iowa this summer: ""Joni's 1st Annual Roast and Ride."" Given Ernst's popularity, it's hard to imagine any of the prospective GOP presidential candidates turning down an invitation to speak. The June event is a nod to her famed barnyard ad from last March highlighting her experience castrating hogs as young girl on an Iowa farm — skills, she said, that had prepared her to cut wasteful spending in Washington. Ernst's biker-themed ad ""Shot"" also drew national attention in May, a month before the Iowa primary. She was filmed rolling up to a shooting range in black leather on a Harley-Davidson.

"A teenage boy wielding two kitchen knives went on a stabbing rampage at his high school in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, early Wednesday, before being tackled by an assistant principal, authorities said. Twenty students and a security officer at Franklin Regional Senior High School were either stabbed or slashed in the attack, Westmoreland County District Attorney John Peck told reporters. The accused attacker was been identified as 16-year-old Alex Hribal, according to a criminal complaint made public. Hribal, who was arraigned as an adult, faces four counts of attempted homicide, 21 counts of aggravated assault and one count of possession of a weapon on school grounds, the documents show. ""I'm not sure he knows what he did, quite frankly,"" Hribal's attorney, Patrick Thomassey, said, adding he would file a motion to move the case to juvenile court. ""...We have to make sure that he understands the nature of the charges and what's going on here. It's important that he be examined by a psychiatrist and determined where he is mentally."" A doctor who treated six of the victims, primarily teens, said at first they did not know they had been stabbed. ""They just felt pain and noticed they were bleeding,"" Dr. Timothy VanFleet, chief of emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, told CNN. ""Almost all of them said they didn't see anyone coming at them. It apparently was a crowded hallway and they were going about their business, and then just felt pain and started bleeding."" Arguing against bail for Hribal, the district attorney told the court that four of the victims were in critical condition, including one who was ""eviscerated."" There's a question whether the victim will survive, Peck said. Hribal is being held without bail at the Westmoreland County juvenile detention center. Authorities have not detailed a possible motive in the attack, but the district attorney said in court the teen made ""statements when subdued by officials that he wanted to die."" 'Don't know what I got going down' The carnage began shortly before the start of classes, when an attacker began stabbing students in a crowded hallway and then went from classroom to classroom. Student Matt DeCesare was outside the school when he heard a fire alarm ring and then saw two students come out of the school covered in blood. Then he saw teachers running into the building and pulling ""a couple of more students out,"" he told CNN. The students had been stabbed. To stanch the bleeding, the teachers asked the students for their hoodies. ""We all took our hoodies off and handed them to the teachers to use as tourniquets to stop the bleeding,"" he said. Recordings of emergency calls released in the wake of the attack provide a soundtrack of sorts to the terror and chaos that played out inside the school. ""I don't know what I got going down at school here but I need some units here ASAP,"" one officer can be heard saying. Minutes later in another call, another official, breathlessly, can be heard detailing casualties: ""About 14 patients right now."" Then another call for help. ""Be advised inside the school we have multiple stab victims,"" one of the officers said. ""So bring in EMS from wherever you can get them. 'Saw the kid who was stabbing people' Student Mia Meixner was standing at her locker. ""I heard a big commotion like behind my back,"" she told CNN. ""And I turned around and I saw two kids on the ground."" She thought a fight had broken out, but then she saw blood. ""I saw the kid who was stabbing people get up and run away,"" she said. Then she saw a girl she knew standing by the cafeteria. ""She was gushing blood down her arm."" Meixner dropped her books and went to help the girl. Bystanders step up in time of crisis . ""I started hearing a stampede of students coming down from the other end of the hall, saying 'Get out, we need to leave, go, there's a kid with a knife.' Then a teacher came over to me and the girl I was trying to help. And she said she would handle the girl and that I should run out. So then I just ran out of the school and tried to get out as soon as possible."" Meixner never heard the attacker utter a word. ""He was very quiet. He just was kind of doing it,"" she said. ""And he had this, like, look on his face that he was just crazy and he was just running around just stabbing whoever was in his way."" She said she didn't know the boy, but he had been in a lot of her classes. ""He kept to himself a lot,"" she said. ""He didn't have that many friends that I know of, but I also don't know of him getting bullied that much. I actually never heard of him getting bullied. He just was kind of shy and didn't talk to many people."" Hribal's attorney described him as a ""nice young man,"" who has never been in trouble. ""He's not a loner. He works well with other kids,"" he said. ""...He's scared. He's a young kid. He's 16, looks like he's 12. I mean, he's a very young kid and he's never been in trouble so this is all new to him."" At least a dozen FBI agents could be seen going in and out of Hribal's family home in the hours after the attack. Shortly before the agents arrived at the house, a man believed to be Hribal's father drove up. ""My prayers go out to everyone who was injured today, and I hope they recover as soon as possible,"" he told reporters. Hribal's attorney said the family was upset by the allegations. ""They did not foresee this at all,"" he said. Stabbing shatters peace in quiet, upscale community . Tackled by an assistant principal . Assistant Principal Sam King is being credited with bringing to an end the 5-minute rampage that authorities say began about 7:15 a.m. ET. King tackled the teen, Peck told reporters. A school resource officer was able to handcuff the suspect, Police Chief Thomas Seefeld said. Assistant principal called 'great man' The accused teen was being treated for injuries to his hands, the chief said. Police Officer William ""Buzz"" Yakshe, who also serves as a resource officer at the school, helped subdue the suspect, said Dan Stevens, the county deputy emergency management coordinator. Yakshe is ""doing fine,"" Stevens said. ""He's more upset than anything else over what happened, because these are his kids."" A fire alarm that was pulled during the attack probably helped get more people out of the school during an evacuation order, Seefeld said. Students were running everywhere and there was ""chaos and panic."" At one point, a female student applied pressure to the wounds of one of the male victims, possibly helping to save his life, said Dr. Mark Rubino, chief medical officer at Forbes Regional Hospital in nearby Monroeville, Pennsylvania, where seven teens were taken for treatment. The students who were hurt range in age from 14 to 17, Stevens said. The injuries were stabbing-related, such as lacerations or punctures, he said. 'It doesn't happen here' The attack in Murrysville is the latest in a string of school violence that has occurred across the nation. But mass stabbings, such as the one at the high school, are rare. The attack has rattled the town, a residential enclave with a population of about 20,000. A message on the Franklin Regional School District's website said all of its elementary schools were closed after the incident, and ""the middle school and high school students are secure."" Franklin Regional Senior High will be closed ""over the next several days,"" district school Superintendent Gennaro Piraino said. The district's middle school and elementary schools will be open Thursday, and counseling will be available for the whole district, he said. Information on what led to the stabbings and the conditions of the injured are still unfolding. Bill Rehkopf, a KDKA radio host and Franklin Regional High School graduate, called the stabbing shocking. He said he kept thinking, ""It doesn't happen here, it can't happen here.""","The DA says 4 people are in critical condition, including one who was ""eviscerated""

"(CNN)The blizzard of 2015 isn't done yet. While sparing much of New York and New Jersey, the much talked-about storm managed to wallop parts of New England on Tuesday. And even after producing coastal flooding and dropping several feet of snow (including 30 inches in Framingham, Massachusetts, and up to 6-foot drifts statewide), there's more to come. ""We fully expect that there are parts of eastern and central Massachusetts where people may get ... another 5 to 10 inches of snow,"" Gov. Charlie Baker said around midday. ""... And there are areas around eastern Massachusetts, at this point, that you would probably describe as being in a whiteout-type condition."" Massachusetts wasn't the only state getting hit hard Tuesday afternoon. The National Weather Service has also reported about 16 inches of snow in Portland, Maine; over 21 inches in Hudson, New Hampshire; and 28½ inches in Orient on New York's Long Island. It's not just the snow. East-facing coastal areas -- already coping with early morning flooding, heavy snow and potent winds -- are bracing for a new high tide and the storm surge expected with it around 5 p.m. Nantucket and its 15,000 residents ""lost power to the entire island,"" said police Chief William Pittman, a situation he attributed to sustained winds of roughly 50 mph, punctuated by gusts of around 80 mph. National Grid had restored electricity, using generators, to most of them by noon, state emergency management director Kurt Schwartz said, though a more permanent solution was still probably a day  away. On Massachusetts' South Shore, the ocean roared inland to flood the Brant Rock Esplanade lined with homes and businesses. The town's police department posted a photo of what it called a ""major seawall breach (that) caused structural damage"" to an unoccupied home, while authorities in neighboring Duxbury showed a deck blown yards away from a home. And not far away in Scituate, slushy ice, seawater and debris clogged streets. ""And they're talking about another wave (of snow),"" said Jim Cantwell, a state representative for both Marshfield and Scituate. On the northern edge of the storm in Maine, Rockland resident Steve DePasa said at 1 p.m. that up to 15 inches of snow was already on the ground, and ""we're expected to get another 10 inches."" So what can you do in the meantime, besides pray that the power stays on? ""It's just go out and clean up a little bit so you can,"" said DePasa, a CNN iReporter. ""Then wait a few hours and do it again."" The good news? Most people seemed to have heeded the warnings about the storm, which was forecast as ""crippling"" and ""potentially historic,"" by stocking up and staying off the roads. If you go through this every year, after all, there's a good chance you'll know the drill. ""During these storms, everybody has to hunker down and just be safe,"" said Bob Connors from Plum Island, on Massachusetts' North Shore. ""We've become pretty proficient at that."" While residents of Rhode Island and Massachusetts battled Tuesday's storm, others in the Northeast -- namely people in New York and New Jersey -- were breathing a sigh of relief. Compare that with a day earlier, when they'd have been more likely to be hyperventilating, given the all but cataclysmic warnings about the coming storm. They were told it could turn 58 million people's lives upside down. Seven states, from New Jersey to New Hampshire, declared states of emergency. School was called off for not just Tuesday but Wednesday as well. Public transit shut down. Businesses closed, suggesting a far-reaching economic impact in one of America's busiest commercial regions. Yet by mid-morning, snow wasn't even falling in New York City. By then, travel bans in New Jersey and New York -- even places like Long Island's Islip, which got more than 20 inches of snow -- had been lifted, as some restrictions remained in effect in neighboring Connecticut. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called all the warning and preparations ""a better safe than sorry scenario."" ""We've dodged the bullet,"" he told CNN. ""This is nothing like we feared it would be."" The forecast even improved for Boston. Once expected to see up to 30 inches of snow, the prediction for the Massachusetts capital was downgraded to 15 to 25 inches early Tuesday. Still, 2 feet of snow isn't anything to scoff at. Just ask all those who had their cars snowed in, their front doors blocked and their backyards littered with branches Tuesday. ""The worst part is the steady winds, I think they were approaching 50 mph,"" said Pittman, Nantucket's police chief. The storm has also proved dangerous. A 17-year-old died after he hit something while snow-tubing Monday night in Huntington, New York, Suffolk County's Tim Sini said. And an 83-year-old man who suffered from dementia was found frozen to death in his backyard in the same Long Island county, he added. In Marshfield, Massachusetts, there are worries that homes and businesses along the coast could experience significant damage due to the deteriorating seawall. ""If you don't have that line of defense, then you could have severe damage and homes that will fall into the ocean,"" said Cantwell. ""Without the seawall, you'd have tremendous erosion."" Even New Englanders who live further inland aren't out of the woods yet. Worcester, Massachusetts, had 25 inches around midday Tuesday, with another 6 inches expected as the afternoon rolled on, Mayor Joseph Petty said. Crews are already trying to clear streets, but it's not easy. ""The biggest problem we have now is the winds putting the snow back on the streets after we plow them,"" Petty told CNN. ""We have about 35- to 50-mph winds, which are supposed to slow down as well."" Yet, as Hartford Mayor Pedro Segarra points out, local authorities can't let up -- not if they want life to go back to normal anytime soon. ""We don't have an option. When it snows, we have to clear the streets,"" he said. And if you're trying to escape this wintry mess, don't count on it. Traffic crawled on everything from side roads to highways -- including the Massachusetts Turnpike, which was closed to traffic as of early Tuesday afternoon -- and many public transit systems shut down. Amtrak was also affected, suspending Northeast Regional and Acela Express services between New York and Boston for Tuesday because of the weather. Flying out wasn't an option due to the combination of stiff winds, heavy snows and ice. What to know if you're traveling . More than 4,700 flights in and out of the United States had already been canceled as of 2:15 p.m. Tuesday, the flight-tracking website Flightaware.com reported. That's on top of 2,800 scrubbed Monday. Hundreds more have already been called off for Wednesday. Some airports turned into makeshift shelters, whether folks liked it or not. A Virgin Atlantic New York-to-London flight was delayed for roughly 6 hours Monday due to an ill passenger, bad weather, mechanical problems and other issues. By the time the flight was finally canceled around midnight, roads were closed and passengers had to stay at New York's Kennedy airport overnight, according to the airline. By early Tuesday afternoon, incoming flights began arriving again at New York's LaGuardia airport. Delta tweeted that it would have a limited number of flights landing at Kennedy and Newark Liberty in nearby northern New Jersey as well. The storm warnings seemed to impress even the most jaded Northeasterner, as groceries flew off store shelves from Brooklyn to Bangor. Still, it's not like everyone was shaking in their snow boots. As Steve Nogueira, a retired meteorologist who lives in Taunton, Massachusetts, said, ""We've done it before."" And the coastal city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, could soon be shaking for a different reason. Hundreds have accepted an invitation, via Facebook, to a massive  community snowball fight -- one that organizer Devin Murphy joked is in the proud tradition dating back to around 1624, when the city was first settled. Murphy said parents have asked if their kids are welcome. They are, he said, and the snow should be light and less dangerous. Some of the bars in the small, close-knit New England community will be open to cater to the snowball fight warriors. Murphy called the response tremendous, especially compared with what he got the last two times he tried to organize such an event. ""At this point, it's just going to be fun,"" he said. Fresh off snowblowing his driveway, Jim Robins estimated about 2 feet of light, fluffy snow had fallen outside his home in Dover, New Hampshire. That's hardly a dusting, but it's also not surprising when you live in New England. ""Sure, that's a lot, but I have tons of family in Buffalo and they were dealing with 6-10 feet of (snow) at the start of the season,"" Robins said. ""...We will weather this like the New Englanders we are."" CNN's Ed Payne, Josh Levs, Ralph Ellis, Ashley Fantz, Sara Ganim, Joe Sutton, Dana Ford, Aaron Cooper, Joshua Gaynor, Taylor Ward, Teri Genova and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.","Flights begin arriving again at New York's LaGuardia airport .

"A Red Cross official who had worked in Iraq, Sudan, Yemen and Gaza was shot dead Wednesday in Libya, the organization said. Gunmen attacked the vehicle of Michael Greub, 42, around midday as he left a meeting with two colleagues in the Mediterranean Sea city of Sirte, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. Libya's state-run news agency, LANA, reported that masked gunmen in a car with tinted windows opened fire and killed Greub, who headed the Red Cross' unit based about 150 miles (245 kilometers) away in Misrata. His driver and an escort escaped unharmed, LANA said. ""We are devastated and outraged,"" ICRC Director-General Yves Daccord said in a statement. ""Michael was a devoted humanitarian who spent many years of his life helping others."" The Red Cross said Greub, a Swiss national, had been with the international aid organization for the past seven years. He moved to his latest stop, Misrata, in March. Sirte was the hometown of Moammar Gadhafi, Libya's longtime leader until he was ousted and killed in October 2011 in a revolution. Since that time, Islamist extremist groups have become increasingly active in the coastal city. The Red Cross has had a permanent presence in Libya since 2011, working with the Libyan Red Crescent to administer first aid and help those injured or displaced by violence.","The Red Cross official killed is Michael Greub, a 42-year-old Swiss national .

"Washington (CNN)Americans' view of the economy is increasingly dour -- though a majority expect things to turn around next year, a new poll shows. Just 38% of Americans believe the economy is in good shape, a CNN/ORC International poll of 1,018 adults, conducted Oct. 24-26, found. That's down from 42% in September -- and it could hurt Democrats' chances of holding onto the Senate in the Nov. 4 midterm elections. Wednesday's survey found that 62% rated economic conditions as ""somewhat poor"" or ""very poor"". The poll found that urban Americans have a rosier view of the economy, with 43% saying it's in good shape compared to 39% of those surveyed in suburban areas and 31% in rural areas. The bigger difference, though, is between the 55% of Democrats who say the economy is performing well and the 28% of Republicans who agree. Just 32% of independent voters say the economy is in good shape. ""With the economy remaining the top issue on the voters' minds, the downturn in positive views of the economy could not have come at a worse time for Democrats,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. The downtick ends what had been a year-long trend of increasingly positive views of the economy. But a slim majority of those surveyed said they're confident things will improve, with 52% saying they believe the economy will be in good shape a year from now while 46% said it'll be in poor shape. The economy isn't the only measure of the country's mood ahead of next week's elections. A CNN/ORC International poll released Tuesday found that 68% of Americans say they're angry about the way things are going in the United States. It also showed that 36% of Republicans are enthusiastic about voting this year, while just 26% of Democrats say they are. That difference could be key in some House districts, and with control of the Senate on the line.","38% of Americans say the economy is in good shape, a new CNN/ORC International poll shows .

Japan has registered a ""strong protest"" with the North Korean embassy in Beijing, Minister for Foreign Affairs Fumio Kishida told a parliamentary session Wednesday. But he said the launch would not affect Japan-North Korea talks scheduled for March 30. ""It is a very important opportunity to make a strong approach to North Korea,"" he said. ""Japan is not considering the change of the plan as of now."" It is believed that two medium-range Rodong missiles -- one at 2.35 AM (local time) and again a few minutes later -- were launched, eventually splashing down in the Sea of Japan, also known by the Koreas as the East Sea. Several launches of short-range ballistics have been conducted in recent weeks, including one that came within minutes of potentially hitting a Chinese passenger jet. It does not appear that North Korea issued any warnings ahead of Wednesday's launches. If confirmed, this latest launch marks the first time since 2009 that the DPRK has fired the Rodong class of missile. ""It is a clear violation of U.N. resolution and we demand an immediate stop to (the) provocation,"" South Korean Ministry of Defense spokesperson Kim Min Suk-fyi said. Kim added that there are no signs to suggest further launch plans. North Korea launches 30 short-range rockets into the sea . Sending a message . The Ministry of Defense in Seoul believes the launch was a reaction to ongoing U.S.-ROK military drills as well as a ""message to the international community,"" given the timing with regards to the Dutch summit. ""These March 26 launches of medium-range No Dong (also known as Rodong) ballistic missiles represent a troubling and provocative escalation that the United States takes very (seriously),"" U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf said. ""We are closely coordinating with our allies and partners, including in the U.N. Security Council, to take the appropriate measures in response to this latest provocation and to address the threat to global security posed by the DPRK's nuclear and ballistic missile programs."" There are a number of U.N. resolutions restricting ballistic missile launches, including several specifically requiring North Korea to ""suspend all activities related to its ballistic missile program and to re-establish a moratorium on missile launches."" Chinese reaction . While there has been no official reaction from Beijing, North Korea's recent saber-rattling is not going to help relations with China, one of the Stalinist state's few international allies, said John Delury, Assistant Professor of East Asian Studies at Yonsei University Graduate School of International Studies in Seoul. ""There hasn't been any fundamental policy shift but we've seen high ranking Chinese officials express their annoyance pretty consistently,"" he told CNN. ""I think (President) Xi (Jinping) is getting an impression of Kim Jong Un as someone who keeps stirring the pot in ways that are detrimental and undercut the ways which Beijing wants to move. This is not going to improve relations between North Korea and China."" The bellicose move comes at a time when North Korea finds itself increasingly isolated, blaming the United States for the breakdown of the six-party talks, and, according to South Korea's conservative Chosun newspaper, even urging its military and officials ""not to trust"" China. Indeed, tensions involving North Korea and its neighbors are rarely out of the headlines. The North Korean state news agency KNCA Wednesday accused South Korean authorities of ""hurting the dignity"" of North Korea's ""supreme leadership"" by dropping propaganda leaflets on five North Korean islands.

"For Atlanta Hawks controlling owner Bruce Levenson, ""a light bulb went off."" In a 2012 e-mail addressing the troubles the franchise faced in attracting more affluent white season-ticket holders, Levenson said he had taken a look around Philips Arena and noticed a few things. First, the audience was 70% black, he wrote. But that wasn't all. The stadium's bars were 90% black. There were few fathers and sons at the games. The cheerleaders were black. The music played in the arena was hip-hop, and the after-game concerts were either rap or gospel acts. ""Then i start looking around at other arenas. It is completely different. Even (Washington) DC with its affluent black community never has more than 15 pct black audience,"" he wrote. Read the email in its entirety . Now, he's losing his franchise because of the e-mail. Levenson, who serves as managing partner and is the team's representative on the NBA Board of Governors, announced in a statement Sunday that he will sell his controlling stake in the team after an ""e-mail two years ago that was inappropriate and offensive."" A man answering the phone at his Maryland home told CNN that Levenson was not taking any phone calls. In focusing on low attendance at Hawks games and the need to boost season-ticket sales and corporate sponsors, Levenson said in his statement, he had spoken with executives about diversifying the fan base and including more suburban whites. During those discussions, ""I shared my thoughts on why our efforts to bridge Atlanta's racial sports divide seemed to be failing,"" he wrote. ""I trivialized our fans by making cliched assumptions about their interests (i.e. hip hop vs. country, white vs. black cheerleaders, etc.) and by stereotyping their perceptions of one another (i.e. that white fans might be afraid of our black fans),"" he said in his statement. ""By focusing on race, I also sent the unintentional and hurtful message that our white fans are more valuable than our black fans."" 'The black crowd scared away the whites' In his 2012 e-mail to Hawks general manager Danny Ferry, Levenson wrote that before his Atlanta Spirit bought the Hawks in 2003, thousands of tickets were being given away, mostly to the black community, in an effort to make the arena appear less empty. It was a trend that continued for a couple of years after the Atlanta Spirit Group took over, he wrote in a seemingly informal e-mail rife with punctuation errors and misspellings. ""My theory is that the black crowd scared away the whites and there are simply not enough affluent black fans to build a signficant season ticket base,"" he wrote. ""i never felt uncomfortable, but i think southern whites simply were not comfortable being in an arena or at a bar where they were in the minority."" Levenson derided claims on fan websites that the arena is unsafe or in a bad part of town as ""racist garbage,"" but then suggested an array of changes inside the stadium, all based on race. ""I have been open with our executive team about these concerns. I have told them I want some white cheerleaders and while i don't care what the color of the artist is, i want the music to be music familiar to a 40 year old white guy if that's our season tixs demo,"" he wrote. He continued, ""i have also balked when every fan picked out of crowd to shoot shots in some time out contest is black. I have even bitched that the kiss cam is too black."" Things had changed since Levenson implemented these suggestions, he wrote, boasting that the crowd was closer to 40% black by 2012, by his admittedly unscientific estimate. That was still four to five times higher than other NBA franchises, he wrote, ""and my further guess is that 40 pct still feels like 70 (percent) to some whites at our games. Our bars are still overwhelmingly black."" While noting this was a sensitive issue, Levenson went on to declare it ""far and way the number one reason our season ticket base is so low. And many of our black fans don't have the spendable income which explains why our (food and beverage) and merchandise sales are so low. At all white thrasher games sales were nearly triple what they are at hawks games."" The year before Levenson wrote the controversial email, the Atlanta Spirit Group sold its NHL team, the Atlanta Thrashers, to a Canadian ownership group that moved the team north of the border. It's now called the Winnipeg Jets. Comparisons to Donald Sterling . In his Sunday statement, Levenson said the NBA should have no tolerance for racism, a sentiment he also expressed during a CNN interview earlier this year when he talked about Donald Sterling, the Los Angeles Clippers owner who was caught making racist remarks on tape. Team owners behaving badly . Discussing Sterling's reluctance to sell the team after the scandal broke, Levenson said in May that, as a fellow team owner, he couldn't be partners with someone who holds those types of views. ""I think I speak for all of my partners when I say we were all deeply offended. We all quickly spoke out against the words we heard on that tape,"" Levenson said. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who brought the hammer down on Sterling, called Levenson's 2012 email ""entirely unacceptable"" and commended Levenson for self-reporting to the league office. Levenson told the league in July about the August 2012 e-mail, and the NBA conducted an investigation, the statement said. ""(Levenson) shared with me how truly remorseful he is for using those hurtful words and how apologetic he is to the entire NBA family -- fans, players, team employees, business partners and fellow team owners -- for having diverted attention away from our game,"" Silver said. The league will work with the Hawks to determine the appropriate sale process for the team, Silver said. Hawks CEO Steve Koonin will oversee team operations, the league said. In closing his statement, Levenson said he was embarrassed by the email and apologized to the team and its fans. ""To the Hawks family and its fans, you have my deepest gratitude for the past ten years,"" Levenson wrote. ""Working with this team and its extraordinary executives, coaching staff, and players has been one of the highlights of my life. I am proud of our diverse, passionate, and growing legion of Hawks fans, and I will continue to join you in cheering for the best team in the NBA.""

"(CNN) -- Fitness isn't usually a requirement for theme parks -- standing in lines, climbing into rides and screaming in abject terror require only basic levels of stamina. Not so at the world's first-ever sports amusement park planned for the Olympic Stadium and other Olympic venues in Barcelona, which promises to give visitors the chance to experience what it's like to race against Usain Bolt. Open Camp will offer more than 50 ""virtual experiences with links to every sport"" when it opens in 2015, according to officials in the Spanish city. Details of how they'll be able to strut their stuff against the world's fastest and strongest are so far thin on the ground, but a promotional video offers some clues. One image shows people strapped to horizontal machines that supposedly mimic swimming as a screen in front of them shows an Olympic-sized pool. Another shows a visitor in ski gear hoisted aloft in a wind tunnel apparently designed to recreate the experience of ski jumping. It's not just about taking part though -- it's also about winning. The park will also stage daily awards ceremonies to dole out bronze, silver and gold. 'Sportainment' experience . A statement said ""the best technology on the planet"" would be used in creating the ""sportainment"" experience. ""Visitors will be able to feel what it is like to be professional football players, run a smooth 100 meters against Usain Bolt, take part in any Olympic Games race recreated exactly as it was in reality and experience a medals ceremony,"" it said. It said the park is intended to breathe new life into the ""neglected"" venues that hosted Barcelona's Olympics in 1992. Since then the venues have continued to host sports events as well as music concerts. ""The park will bring more life to the stadium than it has today and encourage more of the public to use it, while allowing it to continue holding big events,"" says Maite Fandos, one of the city's deputy mayors. More than â‚¬20 million ($26 million) of private funding has been stumped up for the project, which is expected to create at least 240 jobs and bring in up to â‚¬53 million in annual revenues. Tickets ranging from â‚¬20-30 are likely to be priced according to the sports that visitors want to take part in, the statement says. While it sounds exhausting, Open Camp promoter Francesc Medina reportedly insists it'll be an experience for everyone, ""even people with a beer gut."" Would you visit a sports theme park?

"Syria's prime minister defected Monday, becoming the latest among high-profile politicians and leaders to leave the embattled regime of Bashar al-Assad. ""I announce today my defection from the killing and terrorist regime and I announce that I have joined the ranks of the freedom and dignity revolution. I announce that I am from today a soldier in this blessed revolution,"" Riyad Hijab said in a written statement read by a Syrian opposition official on Al Jazeera. CNN Inside Syria . Analysts described Hijab's departure as a significant symbolic blow for al-Assad's government but noted that the former prime minister had been on the job for only a few months. Al-Assad appointed Hijab prime minister in June, a month after parliamentary elections that were boycotted by supporters of those seeking to oust al-Assad. ""In short, this isn't going to bring a lot of insight into what Assad is thinking or doing. It is certainly embarrassing and does some damage to regime,"" said David Hartwell, a senior analyst of Islamic Affairs at Jane's. ""But all indications are that Hijab was probably kept in the dark. This wasn't a man who had Assad's ear. Assad appointed him just a few months ago. He was essentially just another Cabinet member without much power at all."" Hijab was tasked with creating a new Cabinet for al-Assad's regime. Opposition leaders said Hijab had defected, while Syrian state television said al-Assad dismissed Hijab from his post Monday. Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said officials hadn't ""heard anything from the former prime minister,"" according to the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency . The information minister also ""said that fleeing and leaving one's post in an illegitimate manner is an evasion of responsibility and shows lack of political and national awareness,"" the news agency reported. In July, one of Syria's most senior diplomats -- Nawaf al-Fares -- defected, publicly embraced his country's uprising and called for a foreign military intervention. Al-Fares was Syria's ambassador to Iraq. Manaf Tlas, a Sunni general in Syria's elite Republican Guards, also defected last month. Tlas is the son of a former defense minister and a cousin of a first lieutenant in al-Assad's army. Also Monday, the Turkish news agency Anadolu reported that Syria's first man in space -- astronaut Mohammad Ahmad Faris, who flew on a 1987 Soviet space mission -- crossed into Turkey last weekend and proclaimed his support for opposition forces. Hijab, like al-Fares and Tlas, is a Sunni who served in a power structure dominated by the Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shiism. ""If strategically Hajib's defection means very little, it does have symbolic significance,"" said David Schenker, the director of the Program on Arab Politics at The Washington Institute. ""The more Sunnis who split off at this high level, the more it will encourage other Sunnis in their attitudes toward the regime."" Opposition leaders hailed the news of Hijab's defection. Syrian forces deploy heavy weapons in Aleppo . ""We consider the defection to be what is morally right and what is called for at this historic time,"" said Abdulbaset Sieda, head of the Syrian National Council. ""This is a killer and criminal regime, and at this historic moment, there should be no further hesitation. It is imperative to stand by the people of Syria now."" There were conflicting reports about the whereabouts of Hijab. A Syrian opposition official, Muhammad el-Etri, told CNN that Hijab had defected, was ""in a country neighboring Syria"" and would be heading to Qatar ""sometime soon."" George Sabra, a spokesman for the opposition Syrian National Council, said Hijab fled Syria overnight and arrived with his family in Jordan. Jordanian government spokesman Samih Maaytah said Hijab had not entered the country's territories, according to state television. But a senior Jordanian official told CNN that Hijab had defected to Jordan and was with his family. Government officials announced Hijab's sacking after officials discovered he had left Syria, el-Etri said. The former prime minister escaped Syria with the help of the rebel Free Syrian Army, el-Etri said, adding that the plan to defect had been in the works for two months. ""The flight of some personalities, however high-ranking, won't affect the Syrian state,"" state-run SANA said Monday, citing the country's information minister. Meanwhile, fighting raged in Aleppo, Syria's most populous city. Snipers fired from the roofs of buildings and artillery fire rang out in the besieged neighborhood of Salaheddin. CNN's Ben Wedeman said drivers had to dodge piles of rubble in the streets. Residents evacuating to safer neighborhoods left their homes with all the belongings they could carry, he said. An elderly man, carrying a briefcase and a bag full of jam, said he was leaving the neighborhood to move in with his daughter. ""What kind of leader does this to his own people?"" the man said as he left his home. A dark plume of smoke rose in the air near Aleppo's ancient citadel. At least one rebel-controlled neighborhood was notably calmer, Wedeman said. Shops and bakeries were open, and residents walked the streets. Clashes raged for hours at various spots near the city center, some close to the presidential palace, said Bashir Al-Hajji, a spokesman for a Free Syrian Army brigade in Aleppo. As rebels scrambled to fend off regime forces in Aleppo, fighting was reported in other parts of Syria. At least 161 people were killed in fighting across the country Monday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The deaths included 54 people killed in fighting and the discovery of 20 bodies in Aleppo, the group said. At Syrian rebels' funeral, children weep . CNN can not independently confirm reports of violence, as the government has severely restricted access to Syria by international journalists. There were reports of a bombing Monday inside the Syrian state-run TV building in Damascus, the latest in a series of attacks to rock the nation's capital city as Syrian rebels and government forces battle for control of the country. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast. ""There are some injuries, but Syrian media will continue to broadcast,"" the Ministry of Information said on state-run TV. Three Iranian prisoners were killed in the Damascus suburbs during heavy shelling Monday, according to the LCC. The opposition network did not provide additional details. State media reported over the weekend that ""armed terrorists"" had attacked and kidnapped 48 Iranian Shiite pilgrims on a bus near the capital. Roughly 17,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict first flared in March 2011, when government forces began cracking down on protesters, Ban said last month. The opposition put the toll at more than 20,000. Complete coverage: Unrest in Syria .","Opposition reports at least 161 deaths in fighting across the country Monday .

"A U.N. official called Wednesday for stronger international efforts to keep sectarian tensions in Syria from spilling into neighboring Lebanon. ""The situation in Lebanon has become more precarious and the need for continued international support to the government and the Lebanese Armed Forces increasingly important,"" Jeffrey Feltman, U.N. under-secretary general for political affairs, told the United Nations Security Council during its monthly meeting on the Middle East. ""Tensions over domestic and security concerns remain high throughout the country and are easily exacerbated by developments in Syria,"" he said. What you need to know about Syria today . Feltman urged a clampdown on arms smuggling across the Syrian-Lebanese border, which he said posed a risk to both countries. Syria's violence has been spilling into Lebanon since May, when a group of Shiite pilgrims was kidnapped in Syria. A series of gun battles, riots and angry protests that month left at least 11 people dead. Feltman cited the recent spate of kidnappings in Lebanon and Syria by people loyal to the Sunni-dominated rebels and by others aligned with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an Alawite Muslim with strong Shiite support. Will Asma al-Assad take a stand or stand by her man? ""In his report to the General Assembly, the secretary-general strongly, strongly condemned kidnapping and retaliatory hostage taking in Syria and Lebanon, and called for an immediate release of all those detained without due process and in violation of their human rights,"" Feltman said, referring to Ban Ki-moon. As Feltman spoke in New York, sniper fire more than 5,000 miles away rattled Lebanon's divided city of Tripoli for a third consecutive day. The bloodshed in Syria has aggravated decades-old animosities between residents of rival areas of Tripoli: the Bab-al-Tibbaneh neighborhood dominated by Sunnis, and the adjacent Jabal Mohsen neighborhood, which is dominated by Alawites. This week, gun battles in Tripoli have left at least seven people dead and dozens wounded, Lebanese state-run media reported. Both sides said children playing with BB guns initiated the violence, which somehow escalated into shooting by adult residents armed with guns loaded with real bullets. In response, the Lebanese army has intervened, seeking to impose order by force. Syria's neighbors: What's at stake? The violence has raised fears that factional rivalries could erupt into warfare in a country where power is constitutionally balanced among Shiites, Sunnis and Christians. Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon between 1976 and 2005, primarily in the north. They were initially called in to help stop a brewing civil war but maintained their significant presence -- which once numbered 40,000 -- long afterward. Many fear Syria's civil war could threaten the political balance in Lebanon -- one that has managed to prevail since the end of Lebanon's 15-year civil war in 1990.

"Describing it as a ""day that has been a long time coming,"" President Barack Obama made modern history Monday by announcing the creation of a monument to honor the late labor and civil rights activist Cesar Chavez. The Cesar E. Chavez National Monument becomes the 398th unit in the National Park Service system, and the first honoring a Latino born later than the 1700s, the Park Service told CNN. It's no coincidence the move comes less than a month before Election Day, as the president maintains a strong lead among Latinos. A big turnout among Latino supporters in states where the race is close could help Obama win re-election against GOP challenger Mitt Romney. Opinion: Obama hits a foul by honoring Cesar Chavez . The president spoke at a ceremony in Keene, California, on land known as Nuestra Senora Reina de la Paz, where, from the 1970s until the early '90s, Chavez lived and led his farm worker movement. Decades ago, Obama said, when Chavez began his farm worker movement, ""no one seemed to care about the invisible farm workers who picked the nation's food -- bent down in the beating sun, living in poverty, cheated by growers, abandoned in old age, unable to demand even the most basic rights."" ""Cesar cared,"" the president said. ""In his own peaceful and eloquent way he made other people care too."" Chavez's organized labor marches and other protests, including a boycott of table grapes, led to ""some of the first farm worker contracts in history,""  Obama said. ""Let us honor his memory, but most importantly let us live up to his example."" Chavez's movement ""was sustained by a generation of organizers who stood up and spoke out and urged others to do the same,"" Obama said. Chavez, Obama said, believed that ""when someone who works 12 hours a day in the fields can earn enough to put food on the table -- maybe save up enough to buy a home -- that lifts up our entire economy."" Obama acknowledged that there's still ""more work to do"" and ""the recession we're fighting our way back from is still taking a toll -- especially in Latino communities which already faced high unemployment and poverty rates."" Earlier Monday, the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition of 30 Latino organizations, lauded the move. Chavez, who died in 1993, embodied the principle ""that individuals can accomplish more as a community than they ever could on their own,"" said Hector E. Sanchez, executive director of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, in a statement put out by the leadership agenda. The monument includes 120 acres, National Park Service spokesman David Barna said. Obama's order puts property under federal protection that includes a visitor's center, the United Farm Workers' legal aid offices, Chavez's home with his wife, Helen, a memorial garden containing his grave, and other buildings, the White House said. Barna said no sculpture is planned. The monument, in the Tehachapi Mountains, is the fourth designated by Obama under the Antiquities Act. Obama's decision to set aside the land as a national monument also sends a political message to environmentalists -- a key group of voters, as many strongly supported him in 2008. The League of Conservation Voters, which endorsed Obama in 2008 and for his current White House run, has not always been happy with the president's environmental record. As debate raged in 2011 over air quality regulations and proposed construction of a transcontinental oil pipeline, LCV President Gene Karpinski said the administration had been ""caving"" to industry. LCV spokesman Jeff Gohringer said Monday that establishing the Chavez monument stands as ""further proof of President Obama's commitment to our special places across the country and we hope he continues to use that authority."" César Chávez an inspiration to president's campaign slogan and movements . The Chavez family donated certain properties to the federal government so that the monument could be created. Beginning Tuesday, the Park Service will take steps to prepare it as an official site, Barna said. It will become ""one of those places that everyone should visit,"" he said, ""part of our shared cultural heritage."" The land includes property that was once Chavez's home, which  was added to the National Register of Historic Places last year. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar called him ""one of the heroes of the 20th century."" Paul F. Chavez, president of the Cesar Chavez Foundation, said at the time, ""For my father, La Paz was a personal refuge from bitter struggles in agricultural valleys and big cities, a spiritual harbor where he recharged batteries, drew fresh inspiration and prepared for the battles ahead. It was a place where many dedicated people spent years of their lives working with Cesar Chavez for social justice, inspiring generations of Americans from all walks of life who never worked on a farm to social and political activism."" Ruben Navarrette, a CNN.com contributor, wrote a column last year noting that many sites around the country are named for Chavez, and suggesting that that ""campaign"" may have run its course. Still, he wrote, Chavez ""was a great American who helped bring fairness and dignity to the fields and the workers who toil there. Before Chavez and the union came along, there were no collective bargaining rights for farm workers, no toilets or clean drinking water in the fields, and little public awareness about pesticides and other dangers that workers must endure to put fruits and vegetables on our table. He helped change all that.""","Obama honors farm workers' champion Cesar Chavez .

"Fasting and praying for immigration reform is not my story. It's not the story of three fasters, from different walks of life, who decided to go hungry on the National Mall for what many call an issue that has no hope or prayer in Congress. No, this is the story of families, of personal sacrifice and hope grounded in faith to truly drive the attention to the suffering and plight of millions of immigrants in our great nation. It is the story of our country's legacy in jeopardy. Our United States is morally undermined with an inefficient, inhumane immigration system that causes more than 300 deaths in the desert each year. It is a system that rips apart families, exploits workers and puts our democracy out of reach for millions. These are the wounds to our nation and families that drove our movement to the doorsteps of the Capitol where ""Fast for Families"" blossomed and a sea of crosses stand today, hauntingly symbolizing the human lives lost. For 22 days, the energetic Dae Joong Yoon, a youthfully resilient Cristian Avila and I abstained from all sustenance, drinking only water in a tent just a mere 530 feet away from House Speaker John Boehner's office. Day after day, we sat alongside numerous advocates fasting with us in solidarity. The risks to which we exposed our bodies were a reminder of the toll our immigrant communities endure every day Speaker Boehner and the House Republican leadership refuse to address America's greatest moral crisis. While we physically grew weaker and our patchy beards exposed our exhaustion, we were strengthened and honored by ordinary Americans from all walks of life who, in their most vulnerable state, shared their personal histories. Many told us how and why their families came to this country. Some of these stories ended with fulfillment of the American Dream of citizenship, dignity and a better life. Others spoke of families torn apart by deportation or loved ones dying alone while crossing the deserts of the Southwest. The saddest stories made me hungrier for immigration reform. No American story should end this way, but many do. At this point last year, more than 400 people had died while crossing the southern border. By 2014, 2 million people will have been deported. These tragedies are everyday occurrences, not an anomaly. The common threads among those reaching for the American Dream and the tragic endings of an unfortunate reality are faith and hope. The strength we draw from God and Scripture not only enable us to overcome hardship, but also inspire our thirst for justice and our belief that we will prevail. Knowing that each new day of the fast would include these narratives made me all the more determined to visit Speaker John Boehner's office, to attend every community gathering at the tent and to share our stories with President Barack Obama, the first lady, Vice President Joe Biden and countless members of Congress and national leaders who took the time to show their support and solidarity with us as we fasted. While we were grateful to receive visits from several House Republicans as well, Speaker Boehner ignored our invitation. Even though he refused to look at fasters face to face, I believe he has seen our resolve. The movement for immigration reform has been reignited and we are more dedicated than ever to sounding the drumbeat for reform and citizenship. We are far from done. I ended my fast and passed the charge to a new generation of advocates. Congressman Joe Kennedy, grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who had once sat shoulder to shoulder with my late friend Cesar Chavez almost half a century ago, stood before me with the fortitude embodied in our growing movement for immigration reform. It was a poignant reminder of both the length and the direction of the moral arc of the universe. Here we are more than 40 years later, fasting and praying for change, but also for our country's tradition. It is a tradition marked by the generations of immigrants that have been integrated into our national fabric and democracy as full Americans with the benefits and rights of citizenship. This is our country's legacy.","Medina: Failure to pass immigration reform puts America's legacy in jeopardy .

"(The Hollywood Reporter)For those who would give almost anything for a chance at superstardom, ""American Idol"" might be the entertainment industry's version of a Faustian bargain: Through 14 seasons, the very successful Fox show has exploited the fact that there are millions of singers who are willing to sign onerous deals for the chance to compete. But season 11 winner Phillip Phillips isn't going to let the deals he made as a precursor to his fame go unchallenged. On January 22, Phillips lodged a bombshell petition with the California Labor Commissioner that asserts that Idol producer 19 Entertainment and its affiliated companies have ""manipulated"" him into accepting jobs since he hit it big. In a filing that reveals some of Phillips' post-show tribulations, including being forced to perform for free for one of ""Idol's"" sponsors and not even knowing the title of his last album before it was announced publicly, the singer is seeking to void his various agreements with 19, said by the star's lawyer to be ""oppressive, fatally conflicted."" Read more: Van Halen Settles Lawsuit With Drummer's Ex-Wife . ""I am very grateful for the opportunities provided to me through appearing on 'American Idol,' "" says Phillips. ""The value that the fans and the show have given to my career is not lost on me. However, I have not felt that I have been free to conduct my career in a way that I am comfortable with.  I look forward to being able to make my own choices about my career and to being able to make great music and play it for my fans."" The petition to determine controversy is grounded on the Talent Agencies Act, the California law that says only licensed talent agents can procure employment for clients. In the past, the law has been used as a cudgel by Hollywood artists from Arsenio Hall to Kesha who wished to escape paying commissions to their managers. Phillips now hopes to have the TAA applied to an entertainment company. Read more: Fox's First 'Fantastic Four' Trailer Released . Before ""Idol"" viewers voted him the winner that year, Phillips signed a series of contracts governing his management, merchandising, recording and publishing. The deals are quite favorable to 19 Entertainment, a company founded by Simon Fuller that also produces other shows such as ""So You Think You Can Dance."" For example, according to the complaint, when Phillips does endorsements, 19 gets as much as a 40% cut. Nevertheless, Phillips tells the California Labor Commissioner that 19 has a fiduciary duty to him, and that the company has breached such duty by compelling him to take jobs that are of benefit to the company and its affiliates rather than to him. In the time since he's been on the show, his managers at 19 have lined up gigs like performing at the NBA All-Star Game, singing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at a World Series game, and appearing on such shows as Letterman, the ""Today Show,"" ""Ellen"" and ""The View."" The appearances are said to have been ""procured"" by 19 despite not being licensed as an agent. This, the petition argues, amounts to a ""pattern and practice of flagrant violations of the (TAA)."" While some of these gigs boosted Phillips' profile and are arguably in his interest, some other appearances by the singer may have done little to boost his career. For example, the petition says he did a live show without compensation promoting JetBlue in 2013. ""In response to Petitioner's questions about why this deal would make sense, 19 admitted the deal was being entered into in exchange for JetBlue's support for the 2013 American Idol Live Appearance Tour,"" says the petition. ""Since Petitioner was not performing on the 2013 Idol Tour, the only conceivable purpose for Respondent booking the performance was to help the struggling finances of Respondent's Idol Tour."" Similarly, Phillips says he performed at a corporate event for an insurance company — only it was labeled an endorsement deal. Raising a problem with this gig, he says 19 took the position that it was subject to the Merchandise Agreement, with a 40% commission. Phillips argues, ""If Respondent was truly putting Petitioner's best interest above their interests, Respondent should have taken the position that the performances should be commissioned at the 20% commission rate provided for in the Management Agreement."" The petition also chronicles other indignities that Phillips has faced in the past couple of years. He says that 19 lined up a producer for his first two albums that compromised his interests. He says 19 lied to him, saying that the producer wouldn't receive greater mechanical royalty rates than he would. He adds that 19 has repeatedly withheld information regarding his career, including the title of his ""Behind the Light"" album released last year. It's not unusual for those successful on reality TV shows to renegotiate deals at some point in their career. Phillips says that he ""frequently requested"" this, but suggests that the relationship between his management company and recording company frustrated any hope of doing so. According to the petition, ""Because 19 Recordings, Inc. is also Petitioner's record company, 19, as Petitioner's management company, failed to secure even a single improvement to the terms of the Recording Agreement, in breach of Respondent's fiduciary obligations to Petitioner."" Represented by attorney Howard King at King Holmes Paterno & Berliner, Phillips is making a bold and ambitious attempt to bring entertainment companies like 19 within the scope of the TAA, a law that has been controversial since it was added to the books in 1978. Phillips' attempt to challenge his ""Idol"" deals figures to spark jurisdictional challenges and raise issues about the corporate structure of 19, which is owned by CORE Media Group. Phillips will likely also have to get around a notable exemption in the TAA for the procurement of recording contracts. Read more: Fox Beats 'American Idol' Racism Lawsuit . But if Phillips is successful in voiding his deals as a violation of the TAA, the ramifications would be huge — potentially impacting other successful competitors on ""Idol"" as well as perhaps other reality TV competition shows. The adjudication of TAA disputes also tends to be a very, very slow process, with rulings often happening many years after the initial filing of a petition. The result of the creeping pace could put a number of deals in legal limbo, undoubtedly a concern as ""Idol"" and other shows move forward. A spokesperson for 19 Entertainment tells The Hollywood Reporter, ""We're very proud of everything we've accomplished together with Phillip, working closely to help nurture his extraordinary talent and advance his career. We have always acted in the best interest of Phillip. We will vigorously defend ourselves from any baseless claims to the contrary and from any attempt to interfere with our rights and relationships.""","""Idol"" winner Phillip Phillips unhappy with his deals .

"American journalist Steven Sotloff began his last journey into Syria with a surprise gift for his fixer, Yosef Abobaker. It was a small camera. ""Happy birthday!"" Sotloff told his guide, whom Sotloff had befriended a year earlier by interviewing Abobaker's father about the Syrian civil war. Then came the real surprise for the two men: about 15 masked ISIS gunmen jumped out of three cars and took them captive, beginning a dark tale that eventually led to Abobaker's release, but ended in Sotloff's beheading. In an interview with CNN this week, Abobaker provided a detailed account of how he, Sotloff and three armed guards were abducted in Syria by ISIS fighters in August 2013, but since then, never once did U.S. officials try to interview Abobaker about his first-hand experience with ISIS and its captivity of Sotloff. ""No, nobody tried to contact me and I tried to help. Nobody come to me and ask me any questions from the (U.S.) government.... Nobody contact me or ask me about their conditions,"" Abobaker said in occasionally broken English. ""And they can find me. It's easy. But, no, nobody tried to contact me."" A Sotloff family representative who kept contact with Abobaker before and after his captivity reiterated the claims, saying U.S. government or security agencies -- who were made aware of the fixer and his connection to Sotloff -- never talked to Abobaker. ""That was one of many mistakes,"" Sotloff family spokesman Barak Barfi told CNN. He declined to comment further. Abobaker's assertions that his abductors were ISIS fighters couldn't be independently verified by CNN. FBI officials declined to comment directly on the accusations by Abobaker and Barfi, but asserted they are investigating the Sotloff case. ""The FBI is actively investigating the savage murder of Steven Sotloff at the hands of terrorists and will not discuss investigative details at this time. We are committed to bringing the murderers of Steven Sotloff to justice,"" said FBI spokesman Paul Bresson. ISIS' killing of Sotloff shocked the world because it was the second of three videotaped beheadings of Westerners by ISIS since last month. The first was another U.S. journalist, James Foley, last month. Then Sotloff this month. And then British aid worker David Haines, this week. A survivor's torment . Since Sotloff's decapitation, Abobaker has agonized over the fate of his journalist-friend and the fortune of his own release, as well as that of his brother and two cousins who went along as armed guards. ""I was very angry, and after that I calmed down and was so, so sorry,"" Abobaker said in an interview conducted in Turkey. ""I put message on Facebook (to) tell his mother I am so sorry.... I did my best to save him.... My feeling is so sorry, like I lost my brother. ""He was nice man and good heart I just wish he can rest in peace now,"" Abobaker added. Abobaker blamed a guard on the Turkey-Syria border for possibly betraying Sotloff's whereabouts to an ISIS contact. CNN contacted other journalists who worked with Abobaker, and they said he was an established fixer with a good reputation. ""I think maybe one guard from the border, they call him on the radio, and he said he's moved from here, you can wait for him: He has this kind of car,"" Abobaker said. Conscious of security, he didn't use his car that day and instead borrowed one, he said . Their harrowing abduction by ISIS occurred just 20 minutes after Sotloff, Abobaker and his relatives as aides entered Syria, on August 4, 2013, Abobaker said. How it began . The moment the journalistic team entered Syria, Abobaker called Barfi to confirm the group was inside Syria. Barfi was staying in a hotel in Turkey. When asked why he didn't travel with Sotloff into Syria, Barfi told CNN that ""I cannot go into details about that."" This trip wasn't the first time that Abobaker worked as a journalistic ""fixer"" -- or a jack-of-all-trades guide who does translations and arranges interviews. He had 18 months of experience working with at least 100 other journalists, and he was charging Sotloff about $80 a day, he said. Abobaker had also been a rebel fighting for four or five months in Syria with the Tawheed brigade, a moderate Islamist faction. He even got married in his combat fatigues in Aleppo, with comrades firing their weapons in celebration, in February 2013. That was six months before his ill-fated encounter with ISIS. When the masked ISIS gunmen confronted Abobaker and his charges, Abobaker pulled out his gun, but he saw he was vastly outnumbered. ""We were four people, and they are 15,"" Abobaker said. ""We don't have any chance to defend (ourselves)."" How many more Western captives is ISIS holding? Knowing all the roads . The ISIS gunmen took Sotloff and his retinue to a textile factory on the outskirts of Aleppo, and that was the last time Abobaker saw Sotloff. The captives were told to close their eyes, and one captor hit Sotloff with a gun and told him don't look, Abobaker said. ""I know all the roads. I know if they turn 500 meters, they turn left, they turn right...,"" Abobaker said. The captives were held individually in separate rooms, and Abobaker overheard one captor asked Sotloff for his passport, Abobaker said. At first, Abobaker didn't know who the abductors were because they had accents from Morocco, Libya and Algeria, he said. As days passed, he wondered whether he would survive the Islamic extremists waging war in Syria and northeastern Iraq in a quest to create a caliphate. ""Sometimes I say they will kill us all because I work with people from outside,"" Abobaker said. After 15 days of captivity, Abobaker, his brother and their cousins were freed by their abductors. ""They ask me, do you know who we are, and I said, yes, I think you are ISIS,"" Abobaker said. ""And they said, yes, we should kill you. You are spy and work with America and CIA and FBI, but we leave you now because you work with (Tawheed), because I have papers.... But if we hear you work with journalist again, we will kill you for sure."" Sotloff's family believes ISIS paid as much as $50,000 to rebels who alerted the militant group that the journalist had entered Syria, Barfi said. Sotloff's family accuses ISIS leader of violating Islam with execution . Apprising Sotloff's family . Once liberated, Abobaker met Barfi several times to give him details about the abduction, Abobaker said. Later, Abobaker often traveled between Turkey and Syria, and he sometimes asked other former captives of ISIS ""if they know information about any journalist,"" Abobaker said. ""I go back inside (Syria), and I try to make information,"" he added. In fact, Abobaker heard one account that Sotloff was moved from the textile factory to an industrial center, also outside Aleppo, he said. He then heard another unsubstantiated account that Sotloff was moved again, this time to the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, he said. A year passed, and then Abobaker finally saw the news on the Internet. Sotloff -- the journalist and one-time bearer of a birthday gift -- was barbarically killed by an ISIS executioner masked in black. ""I send message to world to say it's not really Islam,"" Sotloff said of the ISIS killing. ""They are liar. I say that to all the people. They are not Muslims."" Abobaker says he has now moved all of his family from Syria to Turkey. Two months ago, he became a father for the first time. Sotloff has final word at his memorial service .","Sotloff fixer Yosef Abobaker says U.S. officials never interviewed him about ISIS .

"Forty-six years ago this month, my father joined Cesar Chavez in Delano, California, to share the Eucharist and end Chavez's 1968 fast for farm workers' rights. It took another nine years, but the state of California would go on to answer Chavez's call for justice and pass its groundbreaking Agricultural Labor Relations Act. That law surged California forward in the global labor movement, but New York never had a Cesar Chavez. And so today -- in the state where my father served as senator and where I now live -- our farm workers suffer from the leftover Jim Crow laws that California addressed nearly half a century ago. As a resident of New York State, I wanted to see the conditions for myself. So I drove a few hours north of my home to Liberty, New York, and visited the largest producer of fois gras east of the Mississippi. If you think what farms do to the geese is bad, you should see how they treat the farm workers. I met a man who worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week for 10 years without a single day off. He was paid minimum wage.  And though he earned it, he could not claim overtime pay -- overtime that would be paid to any deli worker in New York City.  If he tried to form a union, he could be fired. I walked through one-room shacks that housed entire families and past queues that led to filthy bathrooms -- one toilet for every 20 workers. I met women sexually assaulted in the fields by supervisors in return for employment, and children doing backbreaking labor for $3.20 an hour. The legacy of Jim Crow is alive today in New York, resulting in inexcusable conditions for people who plant our vegetables, pick our fruit and milk our cows. All this is legal in New York, the remnants of a bargain struck nationally with the Dixiecrats to exclude minority workers from New Deal federal fair labor laws. The Farmworkers Fair Labor Practices Act, passed by the State Assembly last year and languishing in the State Senate, is the first step to addressing some of these egregious violations of international human rights New York farm workers still face. The bill is far from radical; it merely extends to farm workers the same labor protections nearly every other industry in America has enjoyed since the industrial era. But it would be revolutionary for the roughly 100,000 men, women, and children who give New York its daily bread. The State Assembly has passed the bill several times; where it stalls is in the Senate, a body that has the votes to pass the bill into law, but where special interests have prevented it from coming to the floor for a vote. We cannot allow partisan politics to condemn New York's farm workers to another year of misery and abuse. New York's legislature must bring the FFLPA to a vote in 2014. And when it does, I hope the members of our State Senate will think of that day in 1968, when in front of a crowd of 6,000 farm workers, Robert Kennedy said: . ""When your children and grandchildren take their place in America -- going to high school, and college and taking good jobs at good pay -- when you look at them, you will say, 'I did this. I was there at the point of difficulty and danger.' ""And though you may be old and bent from many years of labor, no man will stand taller than you when you say, 'I marched with Cesar.'"" All of us still have the opportunity to join the struggle today. And if we do, one day when we are old and bent, we will to turn to our children and grandchildren and say, ""I was there at the point of difficulty and danger. I marched with the New York Farmworkers."" Si se puede!","Farm workers suffer from laws California addressed nearly half a century ago .

Passing new bill is first step to addressing human rights violations .

"President Barack Obama on Tuesday bestowed the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, on 13 people from all walks of life, hailing them for changing the world for the better. One of them, Dr. William Foege, helped lead the effort to eradicate smallpox, saving millions of lives. Madeleine Albright was the first woman to serve as U.S. Secretary of State, and Toni Morrison was the first African-American women to win a Nobel Prize. Others who stood calmly while Obama placed the medal around their necks included singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, wearing dark glasses indoors and never smiling; civil rights enforcer John Doar; former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens; worker and women's advocate Dolores Huerta;  former University of Tennessee women's basketball coach Pat Summitt, and former astronaut and U.S. Sen. John Glenn. Three recipients were honored posthumously -- Jan Karski, the former Polish officer who escaped Nazi imprisonment and provided firsthand accounts to the Western Allies of atrocities he witnessed in Warsaw; Gordon Hirabayashi, who defied the forced relocation and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, and Juliette Gordon Low, the founder of the Girl Scouts. A 13th winner, former Israeli President Shimon Peres, will receive his medal at a White House dinner later this year, Obama said. ""What sets these men and women apart is the incredible impact they have had on so many people, not in short and blinding bursts, but steadily, over the course of a lifetime,"" the president said Tuesday. ""They have moved us with their words, they have inspired us with their actions."" They also affected his life, the nation's first African-American president noted. Referring to Doar, a Justice Department official in the 1960s who pushed for integration, Obama said: ""I think it's fair to say that I might not be here had it not been for his work."" ""I remember reading 'Song of Solomon' when I was a kid and not just trying to figure out how to write but also how to be and how to think,"" he said in reference to Morrison's 1977 novel. ""And I remember, you know, in college, listening to Bob Dylan and my world opening up, 'cause he captured something about this country that was so vital. And I think about Dolores Huerta, reading about her when I was starting off as an organizer. Everybody on this stage has marked my life in profound ways."" Obama called the medal ""one more accolade for a life well lived"" and the crowd of dignitaries responded to his urging at the end with a lusty ovation. The president also injected some humor into the ceremony, beginning his remarks by noting the packed East Room was ""a testament to how cool this group is -- everybody wants to check them out."" The medal is awarded to those who make extraordinary contributions to world peace, national interest and security or other cultural endeavors. It was established in 1963 by President John F. Kennedy. Here is a list of this year's recipients and some of the information released by the White House on why they were selected: . Madeleine Albright . From 1997 to 2001, under President Bill Clinton, Albright served as the 64th United States secretary of state, the first woman to hold that position. During her tenure, she worked to enlarge NATO and helped lead the alliance's campaign against terror and ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, pursued peace in the Middle East and Africa, sought to reduce the dangerous spread of nuclear weapons and was a champion of democracy, human rights and good governance across the globe. John Doar . Doar was a legendary public servant and leader of federal efforts to protect and enforce civil rights during the 1960s. He served as assistant attorney general in charge of the civil rights division of the Department of Justice. In that capacity, he was instrumental during many major civil rights crises, including singlehandedly preventing a riot in Jackson, Mississippi, after the funeral of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers in 1963. Bob Dylan . One of the most influential American musicians of the 20th century, Dylan released his first album in 1962. Known for his rich and poetic lyrics, his work had considerable influence on the civil rights movement of the 1960s and has had significant impact on American culture over the past five decades. William Foege . A physician and epidemiologist, Foege helped lead the successful campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s. He was appointed director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1977 and, with colleagues, founded the Task Force for Child Survival in 1984. Foege became executive director of The Carter Center in 1986 and continues to serve the organization as a senior fellow. John Glenn . Glenn is a former United States Marine Corps pilot, astronaut, and United States senator. In 1962, he was the third American in space and the first American to orbit the Earth. After retiring from the Marine Corps, Glenn was elected to the U.S. Senate in Ohio in 1974.  He was an architect and sponsor of the 1978 Nonproliferation Act and served as chairman of the Senate Government Affairs committee from 1978 until 1995. Gordon Hirabayashi . Hirabayashi openly defied the forced relocation and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. As an undergraduate at the University of Washington, he refused the order to report for evacuation to an internment camp, instead turning himself in to the FBI to assert his belief that these practices were racially discriminatory. Consequently, he was convicted by a U.S. Federal District Court in Seattle of defying the exclusion order and violating curfew. Hirabayashi appealed his conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled against him in 1943. After World War II and his time in prison, Hirabayashi obtained his doctoral degree in sociology and became a professor.  In 1987, his conviction was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  Hirabayashi died on January 2, 2012. Dolores Huerta . Huerta is a civil rights, workers and women's advocate. With Cesar Chavez, she co-founded the National Farmworkers Association in 1962, which later became the United Farm Workers of America. Huerta has served as a community activist and a political organizer, and was influential in securing the passage of California's Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, and disability insurance for farm workers in California. Jan Karski . Karski served as an officer in the Polish Underground during World War II and carried among the first eyewitness accounts of the Holocaust to the world. He worked as a courier, entering the Warsaw ghetto and the Nazi Izbica transit camp, where he saw firsthand the atrocities occurring under Nazi occupation. Juliette Gordon Low . Born in 1860, Low founded the Girl Scouts in 1912. The organization strives to teach girls self-reliance and resourcefulness.  It also encourages girls to seek fulfillment in the professional world and to become active citizens in their communities. Toni Morrison . One of our nation's most celebrated novelists, Morrison is renowned for works such as ""Song of Solomon,"" ""Jazz"" and ""Beloved"", for which she won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988. When she became the first African-American woman to win a Nobel Prize in 1993, Morrison's citation captured her as an author ""who in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality."" Shimon Peres . An ardent advocate for Israel's security and for peace, Shimon Peres was elected the ninth president of Israel in 2007. First elected to the Knesset in 1959, he has served in a variety of positions throughout the Israeli government, including in 12 Cabinets as foreign minister, minister of defense, and minister of transport and communications. Peres served as prime minister from 1984-1986 and 1995-1996. John Paul Stevens . Stevens served as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1975 to 2010, when he retired as the third longest-serving justice in the court's history. Known for his independent, pragmatic and rigorous approach to judging, Stevens and his work have left a lasting imprint on the law in areas such as civil rights, the First Amendment, the death penalty, administrative law and the separation of powers. Pat Summitt . In addition to accomplishing an outstanding career as the all-time winningest leader among all NCAA basketball coaches, Summitt has taken the University of Tennessee to more Final Four appearances than any other coach and has the second best record of NCAA championships in basketball.","President Obama says all the winners had a profound impact on his life .

"French gastronomy is a male-dominated world, and its centuries-old traditions are fiercely protected. So, although Anne-Sophie Pic is the daughter and granddaughter of Michelin-starred chefs, it was not always clear she would continue the family tradition. But in 2007, with no formal training, Pic became the only female chef in France (and only the fourth woman in history) to earn the culinary world's top honor -- a three-Michelin-star rating -- for her family's restaurant, La Maison Pic, in the Rhone-Alpes town of Valence. While in 2011, she was voted World's Best Female Chef as part of the World's 50 Best Restaurants Awards. Pic believes her success comes because of, not in spite of, being a woman. She considers the lighthearted taste combinations she has pioneered to be an expression of her femininity: Diners at her flagship restaurant can eat turbot flavored with jasmine, veal sweetbreads flavored with lavender and oysters with sorrel jelly and licorice yoghurt. The men in Pic's life are also important to her success, though. Having left her hometown as a teenager to study management, Pic returned to Valence, aged 23, to learn cooking from her father, shortly before he died. Now 42, she has a six-year-old son and works with her husband to run La Maison Pic, which has expanded to include a boutique hotel, a cooking school and a casual bistro. In 2009, Pic opened another Michelin-starred restaurant in Lausanne, and launched a gastronomic foundation for children. Her first Paris restaurant, La Dame de Pic, opens in September. Here, Pic speaks to CNN about the influence of family and femininity on her work. On the glass ceiling ... In the very beginning -- I'm talking about 20 years ago -- the profession was not open-minded enough to accept a woman in this job, and I felt that very strongly. That can awaken something very strong, though. Little by little, I realized that being a woman could be a strength. It's another way of thinking about cuisine. It's another way of managing people, also. On femininity ... All my emotions are feminine, so I have this feminine way in my cooking. I think some men are able to make very feminine cuisine, but they are perhaps more focused on technique, less on developing the emotional part. My great grandmother taught my grandfather how to cook, so the family cuisine came from a woman. On travel ... I left to study business in Paris because I didn't know what I wanted to do. I spent six months in Japan and six months in the United States. It was good experience. I discovered Japanese cuisine. I discovered Champagne. I was far from my family and I had a chance to grow. From others, I discovered the beauty of my father's job. I needed to leave to understand that. On entering the family business ... I decided to return home in '92 to learn from my father. I spent three months with him. We talked a lot. It was a beautiful time. Unfortunately, that September, he passed away. Of course, it was a shock. How to manage without him? I was in the kitchen but it was difficult because I missed him a lot. I decided to work in reception, but when we lost a [Michelin] star in '95, I decided to return to the kitchen. I felt I had lost my father's third star, and I had to get it again for him. On success ... The main change was that the phone kept ringing all the time. It was like a tsunami. And even though it's an honor, when you get the third star you now must give more effort, more energy to maintain standards and even improve the organization. On trust ... If you are fully booked all the time, you need to have more employees and to train them. I was quite afraid of development. Because I'm a perfectionist, I couldn't trust a team not working with me everyday. But because I'm also a mother, I have to trust people. I'm not in the kitchen all day; I am sometimes with my son. It can be an adventure to trust people. On being a mother ... I was married, I became a mother, and it changed me a lot. It gave me more maturity in my cuisine, also. I used to say, it's more important for me to be a mother than to be a chef, because if I don't feel all is well with my child, I'm not able to work well. So, it influences my creativity. And it balances my character: I'm a perfectionist, but when I go home, I can forget all my troubles. On her typical day ... I wake at seven in the morning and get my child ready for school. I go to work at nine, beginning in the kitchen. If I have appointments with suppliers or if I'm experimenting,  I do that very, very early in the morning because that's the time I feel better. Then there is a lunch service, appointments, discussions about cooking with my assistant. Three times a week, I try to pick my son up from school. Then my husband comes home. We try to dine together, because it's the only part of the day all of the family is together. On mentoring women ... I'm very attentive to the women in the kitchen. I'm always acting like a mother, looking at their face to see if everything is all right, because I know that physically, they can tire before men. Mentally, they are strong. On her husband's role ... I let him manage everything but the cuisine. The only thing is -- and he knows this -- it has to be feminine. When people come here, they have to feel something the moment they enter the house. His work is as important as mine, but he accepts not being in the spotlight and, for me, that's proof of intelligence. And love, of course. On advice for others ... The main thing is to develop your own talent. Sometimes it takes a lot for people to understand what they are on Earth for. You have to trust yourself. When I first started, I didn't know how to cook. I was a woman. I lost my teacher -- my father. But there's always a way to transform negative to positive. You have to believe in yourself. I don't believe in myself all the time, but something inside me tells me, 'It's your job. You have to express your sensibility.' The point is -- and nobody can do it except you -- to find what you are made for.","Anne-Sophie Pic comes from a long line of Michelin-starred chefs .
In 2007, she won the coveted three-star Michelin rating for her restaurant, La Maison Pic .
She was named World's Best Female Chef in 2011 .
Pic says femininity helped her overcome the patriarchal nature of French cuisine ."
"Folk singer Richie Havens, who died Monday at 72, was the opening act in 1969 at Woodstock, the historic counterculture music festival, catapulting him to fame and securing his status as an icon of the baby-boomer generation. Havens would tour widely for the next  40 years and release more than 20 albums. On the 40th anniversary of the Woodstock festival, Havens wrote this reflection for CNN.com in 2009. Forty years ago this summer I wound up opening the Woodstock festival when the four acts scheduled before me were stuck in massive traffic jams and delayed in getting to the concert site in Bethel, New York. My band had made it up from Manhattan in the early morning hours, and we had the least amount of gear to set up, so after some strong convincing from the promoters I agreed to go on. The show was late in starting, and they were feeling pressure to start the music. We played for nearly three hours as they were still building the stage around me. I sang every song I knew, and when they asked me to go back on one more time, I improvised ""Freedom."" When you see me in the movie tuning my guitar and strumming, I was actually trying to figure out what else I could possibly play! I looked out at all of those faces in front of me and the word ""freedom"" came to mind. One of my strongest memories of that day is flying in the helicopter over that vast, spectacular crowd that had already stretched back over the hills and well out of view of the stage. Looking down, my only thought was, ""This is incredible. ... We're really here and they can't hide us anymore."" I've been asked all summer long if I believe Woodstock is still significant and if I think another Woodstock is ever likely to happen. Well, certainly large three-day festivals are still happening all over: Coachella and Bonnaroo in the United States, the Isle of Wight and Glastonbury abroad, but the reality of what made Woodstock become such a historic event has definitely changed. Woodstock happened in August 1969, long before the Internet and mobile phones made it possible to communicate instantly with anyone, anywhere. It was a time when we weren't able to witness world events or the horrors of war live on 24-hour news channels. News coverage was filtered and selective, and we felt manipulated and silenced by the lack of information. So much was happening around us, and we didn't feel like we were being told the truth. With everything that was going on in the late 1960s -- the war in Vietnam, civil and human rights issues, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination -- we rallied and relied on strength in numbers. We came together communally to be heard and to be acknowledged. Though it's frequently portrayed as this crazy, unbridled festival of rain-soaked, stoned hippies dancing in the mud, Woodstock was obviously much more than that -- or we wouldn't still be talking about it in 2009.

"A New York woman who falsely claimed to be a grieving family member of a Sandy Hook shooting victim and set up a fake charity to defraud donors has been sentenced to eight months in prison, according to a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office. Nouel Alba, 37, will also serve two years of supervised release but will not have to pay a fine, said Thomas Carson of the U.S. Attorney's office.  Alba plead guilty in June to wire fraud and lying to FBI agents, federal prosecutors in Connecticut said. Alba, prosecutors said, set up false bank accounts and claimed she was collecting for a ""funeral fund"" set up on behalf of Noah Pozner, one of the 20 children killed in the December attacks. The woman allegedly claimed to be an aunt of the Sandy Hook Elementary School student. Donations were solicited on a Facebook page that Alba had created and to which she had posted photos of Noah. Donors sent $240 to a PayPal account between December 14 and 20, federal prosecutors in New York said earlier this year. Alba's public defender, Deirdre Murray, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. CNN was alerted to the story by a relative of the Pozner family. A CNN producer and camera crew went to Alba's home in the Bronx, New York. She said that the bank account referenced on her Facebook page did in fact belong to her. Alba denied being involved in a scam during an appearance on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" in December. The U.S. Attorney's office said FBI agents contacted Alba after seeing the CNN report and that she told the agents the same thing she told CNN. Alba falsely told agents that she did not post information related to Newtown on her Facebook account or have contact with anyone about such postings or access her PayPal account, prosecutors said in a statement. ""The thought that someone would scheme so quickly and deliberately to benefit from an unspeakable tragedy is beyond belief,"" Kimberly Mertz, FBI special agent in charge, said in a statement. ""While there wasn't a substantial loss of money in this investigation, there were losses beyond any pecuniary measure."" The indictment against Alba in December cited CNN's reporting. Noah, 6, and 19 other children and six adults were shot to death at the Newtown school on December 14. The gunman, Adam Lanza, 20, killed himself after the rampage.

"(CNN)Roger Federer reached the 1,000 ATP Tour wins milestone as he claimed the Brisbane title Sunday but was made to fight all the way by Canada's Milos Raonic in a tense three-set final. The 33-year-old Swiss joins Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl as the only players in the modern professional era to achieve that feat and was claiming his 83rd career title. Federer led by a set and 2-0 until Raonic broke back and reeled off seven straight points in the tiebreaker to level at a set all. The third set might have gone either way, with top seed Federer staving off five break points, but a single break of the Raonic service proved decisive and he completed victory in two hours 13 minutes. It completed a fine week for the world number two as he prepares for a tilt at the upcoming Australian Open title in Melbourne. By contrast, his arch-rivals Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal slipped to early round defeats at the ATP event in Doha to disrupt their preparations for the opening grand slam of the season. Federer, who was surprisingly beaten in the final of the corresponding event by Lleyton Hewitt last year, was winning the Brisbane title for the first time. He extended his career record over the emerging Raonic to 8-1 with his latest triumph, but still has ground to make up on former greats Connors (1,253 wins) and Lendl (1,071). At the presentation he was awarded the trophy by Roy Emerson and a special award for 1,000 wins by fellow Australian legend Rod Laver. ""To get to 1,000 wins in front of you two greats means a lot to me,"" Federer said. ""I'll never forget this moment."" Wawrinka doubles up . In other ATP final action Sunday, top seed Stanislas Wawrinka successfully defended his title at the Chennai Open in India.

"Suspected Fort Hood shooter Spc. Ivan Lopez had recently asked to transfer, claiming he was being taunted and picked on by soldiers in his unit, a senior U.S. official familiar with the investigation told CNN. Lopez is accused of taking his own .45-caliber handgun onto the sprawling Army facility, killing three people and injuring 16 more before taking his own life last week. Three patients are still being treated at Scott & White Memorial Hospital. All three are listed in fair condition and are continuing to improve, the hospital said Monday. In an effort to determine what led Lopez to open fire, the Army is not only looking into his mental health history but also investigating his interactions with fellow soldiers in his unit at Fort Hood, according to a second source -- a U.S. military official directly familiar with the investigation. Lopez joined the 154 Transportation Company at Fort Hood after arriving at the post in February. But he apparently felt some in the unit had not treated him appropriately, that official said. The military official added that it's not clear whether members of Lopez's unit, including his supervisor, knew of his mental health history or that he was being treated for anxiety and depression. Officials have confirmed Lopez received some initial mental health treatment at his previous post at Fort Bliss and was prescribed medications there. Medical examiners will now try to determine exactly what medications he took, whether he took them correctly and whether there may have been some interaction between drugs. Records show Lopez had had regular mental health appointments in recent months. But what is not known, the military official said, is what role, if any, his mental health situation or his medications may have played in his mounting anger and final attack. Shooting timeline . Chris Gray, spokesman for U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, spoke to reporters Monday, outlining what investigators know so far about what happened the day of the shooting. ""We can confirm that the alleged shooter, Spc. Ivan Lopez, was involved in a verbal altercation concerning his request for leave, and the processing of that request at his unit's administrative office,"" the spokesman said. Within minutes of that altercation, Lopez allegedly fired multiple rounds, killing one soldier and injuring 10. He then got into his vehicle, from which he fired his weapon at two soldiers, wounding one, Gray said. Lopez is then believed to have entered the building where he was assigned and worked, which encompasses the unit's motor pool office and vehicle bay area. There, he opened fire again, killing one solider and injuring two more, the spokesman said. Lopez then returned to his vehicle. While driving, he allegedly fired into another moving vehicle, striking and wounding the passenger. He also fired and wounded another solider, Gray said. Lopez is then believed to have entered the main entrance of the medical building, killing a solider on duty and wounding another. ""At this point, we do not know why he entered that building and we may never know why,"" the spokesman said. Lopez returned to his vehicle and drove into a parking lot, where he approached a responding Fort Hood military police officer. ""There was a verbal exchange between the officer and the subject. The military police officer drew her weapon and fired one round when the subject reportedly brandished his weapon,"" Gray said. Autopsy results confirm Lopez was not struck by the officer's fire. The suspected shooter then allegedly turned the gun on himself. The spokesman said there is still no known motive for the shooting. Investigators have collected no evidence to suggest it was connected to any terrorist organization, though they have not completely ruled out the possibility, the spokesman said. Gray continued: ""We sincerely hope -- all of us in law enforcement -- that our efforts to diligently seek the truth will in some small way provide comfort to the loved ones of the deceased and wounded, who are struggling through this difficult time."" Memorial service . President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama are scheduled to attend a memorial service for the victims Wednesday. The ceremony will be held in the early afternoon on Sadowski Field at Fort Hood. Obama vowed after the shootings, ""We're going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened."" White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer confirmed the Wednesday trip during an appearance Sunday on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" Obama also addressed the memorial service for an earlier massacre at Fort Hood, in 2009. Then, Army Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan killed 13 people and wounded another 32. The former Army psychiatrist was convicted of premeditated murder, and a military jury recommended that Hasan be put to death.","The President and his wife will attend a memorial service Wednesday .

"Bob Dylan is being investigated on suspicion of inciting hatred in Paris over comments he made in Rolling Stone magazine, French prosecutors said Tuesday. An organization representing Croatians in France pressed charges against Dylan for allegedly comparing the conflict between Croatians and Serbs to the Nazis' persecution of Jews in an interview last year for the French edition of Rolling Stone. ""If you got a slave master or Klan in your blood, blacks can sense that. That stuff lingers to this day. Just like Jews can sense Nazi blood and the Serbs can sense Croatian blood,"" the influential singer-songwriter was quoted as saying. While a Croatian group has said Dylan was referencing the violence that came with the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, it's unclear whether the long-outspoken musician was referring to Yugoslavia or the crimes committed when the Ustasha ruled Croatia during World War II. The Paris prosecutor's office said Dylan was placed under formal investigation last month by the Paris Main Court for ""public injury"" and ""incitement to hatred."" Vlatko Maric, secretary general of the Representative Council of the Croatian Community and Institutions, told CNN his organization had brought the case almost a year ago. Explaining the council's decision to pursue the case against Dylan, Maric said the artist's remarks in Rolling Stone were of a ""rare violence"" that had deeply shocked people from a nation still wounded by the conflict of the 1990s. ""An entire people is being compared to criminal organizations"" like the Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan, he said. ""The Croatians are peaceful people who respect Bob Dylan as an artist, but we must remind him that he can't make such remarks. ""We have nothing against him, but the Croatians do not want to be insulted."" Lawyer: We'd like a public apology . A lawyer for the Croatian organization told CNN on Tuesday that his clients would be willing to drop the charges if Dylan publicly apologized for his remarks. ""An apology is a better repair than a financial compensation,"" Ivan Jurasinovic said, adding that this would be a far more positive outcome for everyone. ""Bob Dylan is someone who is very much admired in Croatia,"" he said. Asked if his clients had already contacted Dylan to request an apology, he said that the process was ""ongoing"" and that ""they hoped something could be arranged."" Representatives of Dylan and Rolling Stone have not yet responded to requests for comment. Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in 2012, just one of many accolades to come the musician's way during half a century in the public eye. He was also named an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters this year. Bloody conflicts . Between 1941 and 1945, Croatia's Ustasha erected numerous concentration camps ""to isolate and murder Jews, Serbs, Roma (also known as Gypsies), and other non-Catholic minorities, as well as Croatian political and religious opponents of the regime,"" according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Croat authorities murdered an estimated 320,000 to 340,000 ethnic Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia under Ustasha rule, the museum says. Decades later, the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s caused the bloodiest conflict on the European continent since World War II, with more than 100,000 people believed killed. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, a U.N.-backed court, continues to prosecute war crimes committed during that time. The tribunal has said ""the most significant number"" of its cases have dealt with alleged crimes by Serbians or Bosnian Serbs. But there have been convictions for crimes against Serbs by others, including Croats, Bosnian Muslims and Kosovo Albanians.","Croatian group would be willing to drop charges if Dylan publicly apologizes, lawyer says .

"(CNN)The sons of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak were released from prison Monday after serving 18 months, according to the state-run MENA news agency. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak had served the maximum pretrial detention allowed. A previous embezzlement conviction of the two sons and their father was overturned this year, but they all face a retrial on the embezzlement charges. The Mubaraks and four new defendants are accused of embezzling $17.9 million allocated for the renovation of presidential palaces. Mubarak was sentenced last year to three years in prison; his sons to four years each. They have maintained their innocence. The Mubaraks appealed, saying their sentences were too harsh. Mubarak ruled Egypt as President for 29 years before he was ousted during the Arab Spring protests. In another case, he was convicted in 2012 of issuing orders to kill peaceful protesters during the country's 2011 uprising and was sentenced to life in prison. He appealed and was granted a new trial last year. In November, he was cleared of those charges and of corruption. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","Hosni Mubarak's two sons have been released from prison .

"The ""jelly doughnut"" rock that seemed to appear out of nowhere on Mars last month did not fall out of an extraterrestrial pastry box. The rock had been mysterious to scientists because Mars rover Opportunity photographed it in a spot where the rock had not been present just four days earlier. Steve Squyres, lead scientist of the Mars Exploration Rover mission, described it as a white rock with a dark red low spot in the middle. The rock, more than 1.5 inches wide, was named Pinnacle Island. So where did it come from, then? Drumroll please: . Researchers now say Pinnacle Island is a piece of a larger rock, which Opportunity broke and moved with its wheel in early January. Further images from the rover reveal the original rock that the rover's wheel must have struck. ""Once we moved Opportunity a short distance, after inspecting Pinnacle Island, we could see directly uphill an overturned rock that has the same unusual appearance,"" said Ray Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis, deputy principal directory of Opportunity, in a statement. ""We drove over it. We can see the track. That's where Pinnacle Island came from."" No, that's not as exciting as if the rock had crawled into view on its own or been dropped there by aliens. But now that this puzzle has been solved, the rover team plans to drive Opportunity south and uphill to look at exposed rock layers on a slope. The rock has high levels of manganese and sulfur, which may have been concentrated in the rock because of water, researchers say. ""This may have happened just beneath the surface relatively recently,"" Arvidson said, ""or it may have happened deeper below ground longer ago and then, by serendipity, erosion stripped away material above it and made it accessible to our wheels."" Opportunity weighs 384 pounds and measures about 5 feet in both length and height. It recently celebrated 10 years since its January 25, 2004, landing. Opportunity's twin, Spirit, landed on January 4, 2004. Spirit stopped communicating in 2010, but Opportunity continues to reveal details about the Red Planet's former habitable conditions. NASA: 2 places on Mars could have been habitable . Opportunity is the older, less technologically advanced of the two NASA rovers currently exploring Mars. The car-sized Curiosity rover, representing a $2.5 billion mission, is now on its way to Mount Sharp, a sedimentary formation that will allow the rover to explore Mars' history by driving up the peak's slope and exploring rock chemical composition layer by layer. NASA is planning to launch another Curiosity-sized rover in 2020, which could collect samples that later missions might return to Earth.","Researchers: Mars Opportunity rover's wheel broke off a piece of rock .

"(CNN)Barcelona says the transfer ban placed on the club is ""disproportionate"" and ""excessive."" The Catalan club hit back on Tuesday after losing its appeal to the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS) following the decision to ban it from being able to sign new players over the next 12 months. CAS stated that Barcelona was guilty of breaching FIFA rules on signing minors and confirmed that the club would be unable to add to its squad during the next two transfer windows. ""The Panel found in particular that FC Barcelona had breached the rules regarding the protection of minors and the registration of minors attending football academies. Accordingly, the FIFA decision is confirmed in full and the sanction remains in force,"" a CAS statement read. Barcelona, which was also fined $455,000, said it ""totally disagrees"" with the verdict and will now study the different legal options at its disposal including the Swiss Federal Courts. In a statement, Barcelona said that it ""understands and supports the policy on the protection of minors and the concern for the protection of their development and education."" It added: ""This is confirmed by how the club has acted throughout its history, setting an example around the world for the way its young footballers are schooled and educated, and the work that is done on their development. FC Barcelona's youth structure has enabled hundreds of young players to achieve their dreams and receive a decent upbringing. ""The errors that the club might have committed, and which have been recognized and argued before the corresponding authorities are, in all cases, of an administrative nature and to a large extent have been caused by the existing conflict between the FIFA regulations and Spanish legislation, along with the club's conviction that it was acting correctly. ""Therefore, FC Barcelona considers the sanction to be completely disproportionate as it supposes an excessive punishment for the club, when considering its trajectory and the circumstances of this specific case."" Barcelona has one of the most famous and successful academies in the game with young players from all over the world learning their trade with the club. ""La Masia"" as it is known, has helped produced talents such as Lionel Messi, who arrived from Argentina at the age of 11. The ruling comes after an investigation found the club had broken regulations regarding the transfer of young players from outside Spain. FIFA's investigation focused on several players aged under 18 who were registered and played for the club between 2009 and 2013. Under FIFA laws, clubs are not allowed to sign international players under the age of 18 unless the player is moving within the European Union, is aged between 16 and 18 and moving with their parents or the club and the player both live within 50 kilometers of a shared national border. Barcelona was originally handed a 14-month ban in April but launched an appeal to FIFA, world football's governing body which was rejected in August. But the decision to appeal to CAS meant Barcelona was allowed to complete a number of signings in the intervening period. Barcelona splashed out a reported $128.5 million to sign Uruguay international Luis Suarez from Liverpool. Belgian defender Thomas Vermaelen was brought in from Arsenal for $30m while French defender Jeremy Mathieu and Chilean goalkeeper Claudio Bravo also arrived at Camp Nou. Croatian midfielder Ivan Rakitic from Sevilla joined Barca for a fee of $23.9m with the club also paying $3m to Dinamo Zagreb for Alen Halilovic. Luis Enrique's side currently sits second in La Liga, one point behind fierce rival Real Madrid.","Barcelona's appeal against transfer ban dismissed by Court of Arbitration of Sport .

"(CNN) -- He might have been best known for his acting career, but Robin Williams, who has died aged 63, was a cycling fanatic who counted among his friends Lance Armstrong and five-time Tour de France winner Eddy Merckx. When he was once asked how many bikes he owned, Williams quipped ""too many to count"" and he was an avid follower of the professional cycling scene. British-based Team Sky, which has dominated the sport in recent years with Tour de France winners Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome, was quick to pay tribute on its official Twitter feed. ""#RIPRobinWilliams. Thanks for the laughs, we were honoured to have your support. Our thoughts go to family & friends,"" it read. Williams' interest in the sport appeared to be inspired by Armstrong, who was stripped of his seven Tour de France wins after admitting to using performance enhancing drugs in 2012. The Hollywood funnyman took part in the Ride for the Roses charity event in Texas, which was organized by Armstrong's foundation and Williams was a regular supporter on the Tour de France. During a rest day of the 2002 Tour, Williams even rode out with Armstrong and his U.S. Postal team, proudly donning the squad's kit. Through his appearances at cycling's most famous race, Williams also got to know Belgium legend Merckx, who dominated the sport in the 1970s with a string of victories in all of the major tours and one-day classics. ""I am shocked at Robin Williams' death,"" Merckx was quoted on a Belgian radio station VRT Tuesday. ""He had a great sense of humor and he was a cycling fanatic. He was above all a big friend of Lance Armstrong, but he knew me and what I had won. ""If you are a cycling fanatic then you've heard of Merckx. I've cycled with him a few times over in America,"" the 69-year-old added. Armstrong took to Twitter to pay his tribute: ""RIP Robin. I will always remember you as one hell of a friend.

"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been frozen in the public mind by four images. There's the surveillance photo that the FBI says shows him carrying a backpack among the people who thronged the finish line of last year's Boston Marathon -- a backpack that federal agents say held one of the bombs that killed three people and maimed more than 200, severing limbs from many of them. There's the one of a blood-smeared Tsarnaev staggering from beneath a tarp on a trailered boat as a small army of law enforcement holds him in its sights. That ended the pursuit that began when the FBI handed out the first picture. Then there's the gauzy image of a placid, tousle-haired teenager that appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone three months later. That one sparked outrage among many of the survivors and prompted numerous outlets to pull the issue, which featured a lengthy profile of the suspect. And there's the one from his last public appearance -- a sketch of Tsarnaev in an orange jumpsuit standing in a courtroom, repeating ""not guilty"" to the litany of charges against him. As the dignitaries and the survivors and the rescuers gathered in Boston on Tuesday afternoon to mark the anniversary of the bombing, Tsarnaev was sitting in a cell on a former Army installation about 35 miles away. He's scheduled to go to trial in early November, when prosecutors will ask a jury to put him on death row. His lawyers have laid the groundwork for a case that argues that Tsarnaev, now 20, was under the ""domination and control"" of his brother Tamerlan, who was killed in the chase. His defense team is led by a lawyer known for cutting deals to spare the lives of her most notorious clients. But they're facing long odds, said New York lawyer Ronald Tabak, a leading expert on capital cases. ""They're up against the huge amount of pretrial publicity, the negative nature of most of that publicity and the fact that this was a crime that affected the entire area,"" he said. Even if the defense can convince the jury that most of the blame lies with Tsarnaev's dead brother, ""They still have to deal with several people being killed and many other people being injured for no reason that would make sense to just about anybody, other than someone who was mentally ill or believed in terrorism,"" Tabak said. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was seven years older, a onetime Golden Gloves boxing champion and an increasingly radical adherent of Islam, according to associates. Investigators say the Tsarnaev brothers tried to bolt from Boston after the FBI released their pictures on April 18, killing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer in the process. Tamerlan was run over by his kid brother as they battled police who were closing in, according to the indictment against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. In the past year, investigators also linked Tamerlan to the slayings of three men in a Boston suburb a year and a half before the bombings. It was a particularly grisly scene: The heads of the three victims were pulled back and their throats slit ear to ear with great force, marijuana was spread over the bodies in what investigators called a symbolic gesture, and several thousand dollars in cash was left at the apartment. In court papers, Dzhokhar's lawyers argued that the killings demonstrated that his brother ""was an all-powerful force who could not be ignored or disobeyed."" They've also raised questions about whether Tamerlan suffered from mental illness and suggested his ""paranoia and distress"" were fueled by an FBI attempt to recruit him as an informant. The government responded last week that it has no evidence agents ever tried to recruit Tamerlan. It says Dzhokhar Tsarnaev downloaded jihadist literature to his computer, including the first issue of al Qaeda's Inspire magazine -- the one that shows how to build a bomb from a pressure cooker, the type of weapon used on Boylston Street. The indictment against him describes how the brothers test-fired guns and bought fireworks that held 8 pounds of explosives. And it recounts the messages scrawled inside the boat where Dzhokhar was found -- messages that accused the United States of killing ""innocent civilians"" and warned, ""Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop."" The Tsarnaev family originally came from Chechnya, a war-torn corner of southwestern Russia where Islamist guerrillas have been battling government forces for a decade and a half. Both brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan; Dzhokhar had become an American citizen, while Tamerlan's application was still pending when the bombing occurred. In 2011, Russian intelligence had asked the FBI to keep tabs on Tamerlan, who had become an increasingly devout Muslim. The FBI said Moscow believed ""that he was a follower of radical Islam"" and was preparing to head for Russia ""to join unspecified underground groups."" FBI agents checked out the tip, found no information linking Tamerlan to terrorism and asked the Russians to let them know if they had anything else to support their claims, according to an inspector general's report released last week. There was no response, the report concluded. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers might be able to spare their client's life if they can show jurors that Tamerlan held ""an unusual sway"" over his brother, Tabak said. They might also be helped by the fact that the state of Massachusetts hasn't had capital punishment since 1984, indicating that jurors drawn from the state are less likely to put someone to death, he said. But because this is a federal case, the jury will be drawn from a broader pool -- and that pool may include more conservative suburban or rural residents who are more inclined to support executions, said Tabak, who leads the death penalty committee of the American Bar Association's Section of Individual Rights and Responsibilities. In the meantime, Tsarnaev awaits his date with a jury. And in Boston, a grim anniversary will soon give way to another year's marathon.

"With the beheading of a second American journalist, Steven Sotloff, militant group ISIS delivered another brutal message to the Western world. And, as with the execution of journalist James Foley before him, ISIS ended its video -- titled ""A second message to America"" -- with a threat to another Western hostage, this time a Briton. The three are not the only Westerners held by the militant group. And their plight has raised fears for the safety of all those taken hostage. Thousands of Syrians and Iraqis have been slain by ISIS militants as the Sunni extremist group seeks to build an Islamic caliphate stretching across a swath of territory. But the execution of Western captives holds greater shock value outside the region's borders -- and represents a powerful propaganda tool. CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said that the method of killing has a specific purpose for ISIS. A video like the one showing Sotloff's killing ""really energizes"" supporters of ISIS, and beheading is employed for ""maximum propaganda"" to ""terrify"" ISIS' enemies, Cruickshank said. Alternatively, Western hostages, often journalists or aid workers, can be a useful tool if kept alive: either freed for hefty ransoms, used as bargaining chips for the militants' ends or sold on to other extremist groups. It's hard to know how many captives there are because governments, employers and families tend to keep kidnappings quiet for fear of putting the victims in greater danger while negotiators work to secure their release. ISIS is believed to be holding a number of Americans, a U.S. official told CNN after Foley's execution. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to identify them or say exactly how many Americans are being held. Missing journalists . The Committee to Protect Journalists estimates that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria -- most of them local, some from outside Syria. It says many of them are believed to be held by ISIS. Among them is American Austin Tice, a freelance journalist who was contributing articles to The Washington Post. He disappeared in Syria in August 2012. There has been no word of or from him since his abduction. Altogether, more than 80 journalists have been abducted in Syria since the conflict started, according to the CPJ. Some have been freed, others killed. Often a media blackout on journalists' abductions is lifted only in best- and worst-case scenarios. The kidnapping of American journalist Peter Theo Curtis was publicized only after he was handed over to U.N. peacekeepers in August by al-Nusra Front, a Syrian rebel group with al Qaeda ties, after almost two years in captivity. Qatari officials helped secure his release, his family said. It emerged after Foley's death that U.S. special operations units were sent into Syria this summer to rescue him and other hostages, but their mission proved unsuccessful. Richard Byrne, a spokesman for the news website GlobalPost, also revealed that ISIS had demanded a ransom of 100 million euros (about $132 million) for Foley's release. The journalist freelanced for GlobalPost and other news organizations. After his death, Foley's mother, Diane, expressed concern about other hostages on the Free James Foley Facebook page. ""We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world,"" she wrote. Sotloff's mother, Shirley Sotloff, also had directed an emotional plea for her son's release to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, to no avail. Beheading of American journalist recalls past horrors . To pay or not to pay? Fears for the safety of Westerners held by Islamist militants have also highlighted the different approaches taken by governments when it comes to kidnappings. The UK government has a hard-line policy of never paying ransoms. The U.S. government also does not negotiate with terrorists. At the same time, other European governments in the past are thought to have handed over cash to terror groups to ensure the release of nationals. The United States, as in the case with the thwarted Foley mission, has in the past attempted hostage rescues. Sometimes these can work out, as happened in 2012 when Navy SEALs rescued U.S. aid worker Jessica Buchanan and fellow aid worker Poul Thisted of Denmark after three months' captivity in Somalia. They had been abducted while traveling there for the Danish Refugee Council. But sometimes, such attempts fail. Linda Norgrove, a kidnapped British aid worker, was accidentally killed by a U.S. grenade during a SEAL rescue bid in Afghanistan in 2010. The UK government said it had attempted to rescue the British citizen shown in the latest ISIS video ""some time ago"" but failed. UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond provided scant details of the rescue attempt or any other plans in the works. ""You wouldn't expect me to discuss various options that we will be considering,"" he said. ""But I can assure you that we will look at every possible option to protect this person."" Tortured, beaten in captivity . While negotiations for potential releases continue, little or nothing is made public about the hostages' background or their plight. Out of public view, Sotloff's family members, their congressional representative and a number of government agencies had tried to gain his release for the past year. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry highlighted the efforts made behind the scenes in a statement Wednesday. ""For so many who worked so long to bring Steven and the other Americans home safely, this was not how the story should've ended,"" he said. ""It's a punch to the gut. The U.S. government has used every military, diplomatic and intelligence tool we have, and we always will. Our special operations forces bravely risked a military operation to save these lives, and we've reached out diplomatically to everyone and anyone who might be able to help. That effort continues, and our prayers remain -- as they always are -- with the families of all hostages who remain trapped in Syria today."" Beaten, tortured . After Foley's death, details slowly emerged of the experiences he endured after his abduction while he was on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012. A source who says he was held last year with Foley told CNN's Bharati Naik that he, Foley and another journalist were held from March to August 2013 in a prison in Aleppo, Syria. At the time, the source -- who spoke on condition of anonymity -- said they were being held by al-Nusra Front. At one point, according to the source, there were nearly 100 people -- including European journalists -- in the prison. The source said Foley and the other journalist, who was not Sotloff, were transferred to an ISIS training camp. Foley and the other journalist, according to the source, were tortured in prison -- mostly beaten. French journalist Nicolas Henin, who was taken hostage in June 2013 with French photographer Pierre Torres, told CNN that he also had been held with Foley in northern Syria before his release this year -- and that Foley ""had to endure more because he was American."" Henin and Torres were freed along with two other French journalists, Didier François and Edouard Elias, on April 19. It's not known what went on behind the scenes to secure their freedom, but French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius insisted that France had not paid a ransom, Radio France Internationale reported at the time. Other Westerners held in Syria also have been released in recent months. Two Spanish journalists held for more than six months in Syria -- El Mundo staff correspondent Javier Espinosa and freelance photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova -- were freed in March. At the time of their capture, El Mundo said the journalists' captors were reported to be members of a group linked to ISIS. And a Danish photographer, Daniel Rye Ottosen, was freed in June, the Danish Foreign Ministry said, having been held captive in Syria since May 2013.

"(CNN) -- Sepp Blatter faced a revolt from leading European football officials Tuesday over his intention to stand for re-election as FIFA president for a fifth four-year term from 2015. According to UEFA sources, Blatter, 78, told a meeting of the European football confederation in Sao Paulo that he would be seeking a further mandate. It reverses a pledge made in 2011 that he would not stand again and influential delegates at the meeting openly voiced their opposition to his U-turn. ""The atmosphere was quite tense during and after Blatter's short speech,"" the sources told CNN. Blatter was directly challenged by Michael Van Praag, president of the Dutch FA, who told him that he should not continue after 2015 in his role. Praag, a member of UEFA's executive committee, later relayed to gathered reporters outside the meeting what he had told Blatter. ""I then said at the microphone: 'I like you a lot, there is nothing personal here, but the reputation of FIFA is today inextricably linked to corruption. ""FIFA has a president. You are responsible, you should not stand again."" David Gill, the English FA's representative on the Exco committee, also called on Blatter to reconsider his decision to seek re-election. ""The very fact in 2011 he was clear it was just for four years, that should have been the situation. To change his mind is disappointing,"" he said. ""I think we need a full, frank and open debate about what FIFA needs going forward,"" he added. Gill's colleague, English FA chairman Greg Dyke, criticized Blatter in a strongly-worded statement to the meeting. Dyke was angered over Blatter's reported comments to the African Football Confederation (CAF) Monday that allegations of corruption made against the successful Qatar bid for the 2022 World Cup were motivated by racism and discrimination. ""I said to him, 'I regard the comments you made yesterday about allegations in the British media in which you described them as racist as totally unacceptable,"" Dyke told gathered reporters. ""The allegations being made are nothing to do with the racism, they are allegations about corruption."" Dyke also voiced his disappointment over Blatter's intention to stand for re-election. ""We accepted four years ago he was going to step down (in 2015) and it's a surprise he is going to stand again,"" he told Sky Sports News. ""We would like to see an election, a competition and some different candidates,"" added Dyke. The Dutch and British representatives were not alone in expressing their dismay over the leadership of football's world governing body. According to UEFA sources, four members of its executive committee and its general secretary, Gianni Infantino, openly questioned Blatter's governance and his ability to lead necessary reforms in briefings to the media. Blatter, who has been president of FIFA since 1998, will address its 64th Congress meeting Wednesday in Sao Paulo where it is expected he will make public his decision to stand for re-election. The same meeting will also hear from U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia, who has been appointed by FIFA to lead an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, awarded to Russia and Qatar. Garcia was given the task of probing allegations of bribery and corruption, but his findings are not due to be made public until mid-July. His investigation has been brought into sharp focus by a series of articles in the British newspaper The Sunday Times on the Qatar bid. The newspaper claims to have unearthed millions of emails and other documentation which allege Qatar's former FIFA member Mohamed Bin Hammam used a multi-million dollar slush fund to buy support for the bid. The claims have been strenuously denied by Qatar organizers, who in a statement released to CNN Sunday said they had been co-operating fully with Garcia's investigation. ""We remain totally confident that any objective inquiry will conclude we won the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup fairly,"" it added. The latest controversies come in the countdown to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, which will start Thursday in Sao Paulo with a game between the hosts and Croatia.","Sepp Blatter facing calls not to stand for re-election as FIFA president .

"(CNN) -- The man tasked with investigating the World Cup bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments resigned Wednesday, plunging world football into turmoil. Michael Garcia's resignation followed world governing body FIFA's decision to throw out his appeal after he complained about the way his report into the bidding process had been summarized by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert -- FIFA's independent ethics adjudicator. ""I disagree with the Appeal Committee's decision,"" said the American lawyer Garcia -- the chairman of the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee -- in a public statement. ""It now appears that, at least for the foreseeable future, the Eckert Decision will stand as the final word on the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process. ""No independent governance committee, investigator, or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organization."" FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he was surprised by Garcia's resignation but that the ""work of the Ethics Committee will nonetheless continue."" ""Pending the election of a new chairman of the Ethics Committee by the FIFA Congress, the FIFA Executive Committee will appoint an acting chairman to serve as a replacement for Mr Garcia,"" added Blatter, who will be at FIFA ExCo's meeting in Marrakech on Thursday and Friday. However Jerome Champagne, who is standing against Blatter in the 2015 FIFA presidential election, said Garcia's decision was ""a step backwards."" ""We need to know what happened before and after the 2 December 2010 vote,"" added Champagne, referring to the date Russia and Qatar won the right to stage the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. ""When will the facts be known fully, transparently and above all without suspicion? When will we be able to start rebuilding FIFA's image? And we need to protect the World Cup."" Garcia said his decision to resign had also been in influenced by FIFA's ""lack of leadership."" ""Now even FIFA's very own lead investigator has recognized what many of us have warned for months: its self investigation process is neither valid nor credible,"" said U.S. lawyer David Larkin, who has been a campaigner for greater accountability from FIFA. It has been a difficult few months for Garcia. In September the American said for the first time that his report should be made public with redactions. FIFA rejected his request on the grounds that witness confidentiality for his work could prove difficult to sustain if the report was published. Then Eckert published his summary, prompting Garcia to respond by saying the German judge's 42-page report contained ""numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations."" In his resignation statement Garcia went even further. ""A brief I filed with the FIFA Appeal Committee on November 24, 2014, outlined the Eckert Decision's most serious failings,"" said the American lawyer. ""Among other points, the brief explained why, when viewed in the context of the Report it purported to summarize, no principled approach could justify the Eckert Decision's edits, omissions, and additions."" After Eckert's summary was published, Garcia also faced pressure from two whistle-blowers. Phaedra Al-Majid and Australian Bonita Mersiades gave evidence to Garcia and claim he broke his promise over an offer of anonymity if they helped with his investigative report. The two women insist that assurances were given to them both in private and public that they would not be compromised after agreeing to give evidence ""through a sense of natural justice and a desire to bring closure to a long running chapter in our lives."" The women were not identified by name, but they contend they were ""clearly identifiable"" in the summary of Garcia's report. However, FIFA's disciplinary committee said Tuesday there ""were no grounds to justify the opening of disciplinary proceedings"" given ""the breach of confidentiality claim had no substance."" Responding to Garcia's resignation, Mersiades welcomed his decision, given he ""agrees with what many of us have long stated -- that FIFA is incapable of reform or cultural change with its current leadership."" Al-Majid described the American's departure from FIFA was ""one more, emphatic exposure of FIFA's self-protecting corruption."" She added: ""FIFA has no ethics. Its rules are a farce. Not even an extensive, purportedly independent, two year investigation and report could affect its culture. ""Why would anyone believe or trust anything it says?""","Independent Chairman of the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee resigns .

"Federal prosecutors say they'll seek the death penalty against Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, arguing that he acted in ""an especially heinous, cruel and depraved manner"" and lacks remorse. The highly anticipated announcement Thursday means that when the case against Tsarnaev goes to trial, jurors will not only weigh whether he's guilty, but also whether he deserves to die. For Liz Norden, it's one small step forward. Her sons, JP and Paul, each lost a leg in the bombings, which killed three people and injured more than 250 at the April 15 race. ""I just am relieved that it's going forward in the right direction, one step forward in the recovery process, just that the option is out there on the table for the jurors, if that's the way it goes,"" she told CNN's The Situation Room. Whenever the case goes to trial, Norden said she plans to attend every day. ""It's important to me. I'm trying to make sense of what happened that day. My boys went to watch a friend run the marathon, and one came home 46 days later. The other one, 32 days later. And their lives are forever changed,"" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""So I want to try and find out, somehow, to make some sense of how somebody could do this to all these innocent people."" Attorney general: Harm caused was factor . Authorities allege Tsarnaev, a Chechnya-born American, and his brother Tamerlan planted two homemade bombs near the finish line of the marathon, then killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer three days later. The attacks triggered the massive manhunt that led to Tsarnaev's capture. Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev during the manhunt. ""The nature of the conduct at issue and the resultant harm compel this decision,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement released by the Justice Department Thursday announcing that prosecutors would pursue the death penalty in the case. Death penalty in the United States gradually declining . After Holder made his decision, prosecutors filed a notice listing factors that they argue justify a death sentence in the case. Among them: The attack killed multiple people, involved substantial planning and premeditation and involved betrayal of the United States, prosecutors said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is charged with 30 federal counts stemming from the attack. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. The decision announced Thursday is no surprise, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. ""This is a case, that, if you believe in the death penalty, seems to cry out for the death penalty, even though the defendant is only 19 years old, and potentially the junior partner to his late brother,"" Toobin said. But that doesn't mean it's an open-and-shut case. ""One of the most interesting, difficult, strategic decisions the defense faces,"" Toobin said, is whether to push for a change of venue for the trial. ""Boston was obviously deeply traumatized by this incident. And the jury pool is Boston, if the case remains where it is. But Boston is also probably the most liberal city in the country. Death penalty opposition there is higher than anywhere else,"" Toobin said. ""So does the defense go somewhere else, where people don't have the immediate association with the crime? Or do they go somewhere that might not oppose the death penalty in the same numbers?"" Massachusetts abolished the death penalty three decades ago, but prosecutors can seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev because federal law allows for the penalty in certain circumstances. Despite Holder's decision to authorize the death penalty in the Tsarnaev case, prosecutors still could reach a plea deal for a lesser sentence with his attorneys, who include death penalty lawyer Judy Clarke. Boston Marathon terror attack timeline . Survivor speaks out . Federal officials weighed a number of factors before they announced their decision, including the opinions of victims of the deadly attack. Survivors were asked to fill out a questionnaire about what they thought about the death penalty. Marc Fucarile, who lost a leg in the bombing, said he has no doubt about where he stands: Tsarnaev deserves to die. ""I prefer the death penalty, because I prefer that people know that if you terrorize our country, you're going to be put to death,"" he told CNN affiliate WCVB. ""And I strongly believe that's how it should be."" Life since the bombing hasn't been easy, he said. ""This is almost kind of too easy for him (Tsarnaev),"" Fucarile told WCVB. ""I still haven't walked for more than day in a prosthetic, and it's almost a year later. ... Life's good, you know. It's going to get better, but it's going to be a road, and it's going to be a long road for the rest of our lives."" In a statement Thursday, Gov. Deval Patrick urged the state's residents to stay strong. ""One way or another, based on the evidence, Tsarnaev will die in prison. In each milestone of the case -- today's announcement, the trial and every other significant step in the justice process -- the people hurt by the Marathon bombings and the rest of us so shocked by it will relive that tragedy,"" he said. ""The best we can do is remind each other that we are a stronger Commonwealth than ever, and that nothing can break that spirit."" Victims' mom: 'It shouldn't have happened' Tsarnaev's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reached before federal authorities announced their decision to seek the death penalty, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, the suspect's mother, did not comment on the specifics of the case. ""We are, you know, sickened about our child. ... We have nothing in our heads or in our hearts, so what should I say? We are just really sick,"" she told CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in a telephone interview. ""The only thing I want to say,"" she said, ""is I want the whole world to hear that I love my son, my precious Dzhokhar. That's it."" Thousands of miles away, another mother -- Norden -- said her love for her own sons makes her want to learn more about Dzhokhar Tsarnaev during the trial, to try to understand why the deadly attacks occurred. ""I watch my sons, and it's sad. Their lives have changed, and they're OK with it. They've learned to accept it. But I can't,"" she said, her voice cracking. ""You know, those are my kids, and they went to watch a marathon on the streets of Boston, and it shouldn't have happened.""

"(CNN) -- With the 2010 World Cup being held in South Africa next year CNN takes a look at one of the greatest talents South African football has ever produced, Jomo Sono. Jomo Sono's international career never took off because of South Africa's exclusion from world football. Matsilela Ephraim Sono was born in 1955 in Soweto, but his career as an international player never got off the ground as South Africa were officially expelled by world governing body FIFA in 1976 during the apartheid regime in the country. The Black Prince, as he was known, made his mark as a player of legendary skill who was denied a world stage through circumstances beyond his control. Sono was a midfield general and renowned for his dribbling and accurate passing -- but it is difficult to say how he would have faired against the best players in the world as he was not given the opportunity. Watch CNN's interview with Sono. ""He was one of the first South Africans to play overseas where he played for the New York Cosmos alongside Pele,"" South African football writer Mo Allie told CNN. ""He played at a time when South Africa was internationally isolated so there was no opportunity for players to showcase their skills to the world. ""But he was fortunate in that he got the opportunity to go to the U.S. and he did very well there, playing alongside greats such as Pele."" After accomplishing everything that he set out to do at home club Orlando Pirates, Sono starred for the New York Cosmos, Colorado Caribous and Toronto Blizzard in the United States. On his return to South Africa after his retirement, Sono bought the Highlands Park Club in Johannesburg in 1982 and renamed it Jomo Cosmos in honor of his old team in New York, before becoming coach of the South African national side. ""So many of today's South African players would have heard a lot about Jomo Sono but many wouldn't have seen him in action apart from a few snippets of TV highlights,"" Allie added. ""They will identify more with him as a coach because he led the national side in the 1998 African Cup of Nations and took them to the 2002 World Cup finals."" Sono has proved to be as astute off the pitch as he was on it and has become a successful businessman, owning a number of companies around Johannesburg. And the current South African squad will be looking to carry on his footballing legacy when they attempt to become the first African team to win the World Cup next year.","Jomo Sono is one of the greatest footballers South Africa has ever produced .

"Iran says it has sent a monkey into space for the second time, representing the nation's latest step toward sending humans into space. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani tweeted about it Saturday. ""In total, this is the 2nd monkey sent into space & returned in perfect health to #Iran. I congratulate the Leader, scientists & the nation,"" Rouhani said. The launch was part of the nation's national Research Week, Iranian state news agency IRNA said. The monkey's name is Fargam, a combination of two Farsi words ""auspicious"" and ""luck."" Fargam was launched 75 miles (120 kilometers) up into space and back in the 15-minute mission, IRNA reported. Iran made a similar announcement in January, saying then that it had launched the first monkey into space, strapped snugly into a rocket, and returned it safely to Earth. That announcement was met by skepticism by some. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters then that while she saw pictures of ""the poor little monkey,"" the United States doesn't ""have any way to confirm this (happened), one way or another."" ""But our concerns with Iran's development of space launch vehicle technologies are obviously well-known: Any space launch vehicle capable of placing an object in orbit is directly relevant to the development of long-range ballistic missiles,"" she told reporters.","Iran's president says it has launched a monkey into space .

"(CNN)  -- Although women the world over have been doing it for centuries, we can't really blame a guy for being a guy. And this is especially true now that we know that the male and female brains have some profound differences. Our brains are mostly alike. We are the same species, after all. But the differences can sometimes make it seem like we are worlds apart. The ""defend your turf"" area -- dorsal premammillary nucleus -- is larger in the male brain and contains special circuits to detect territorial challenges by other males. And his amygdala, the alarm system for threats, fear and danger is also larger in men. These brain differences make men more alert than women to potential turf threats. Meanwhile, the ""I feel what you feel"" part of the brain -- mirror-neuron system -- is larger and more active in the female brain. So women can naturally get in sync with others' emotions by reading facial expressions, interpreting tone of voice and other nonverbal emotional cues. Perhaps the biggest difference between the male and female brain is that men have a sexual pursuit area that is 2.5 times larger than the one in the female brain. Not only that, but beginning in their teens, they produce 20 to 25-fold  more testosterone than they did during pre-adolescence. If testosterone were beer, a 9-year-old boy would be getting the equivalent of a cup a day. But a 15-year-old would be getting the equivalent of nearly two gallons a day. This fuels their sexual engines and makes it impossible for them to  stop thinking about female body parts and sex. And so begins the 'Man Trance' All that testosterone drives the ""Man Trance""-- that glazed-eye look a man gets when he sees breasts. As a woman who was among the ranks of the early feminists, I wish I could say that men can stop themselves from entering this trance. But the truth is, they can't. Their visual brain circuits are always on the lookout for fertile mates. Whether or not they intend to pursue a visual enticement, they have to check out the goods. To a man, this is the most natural response in the world, so he's dismayed by how betrayed his wife  or girlfriend feels when she sees him eyeing another woman. Men look at attractive women the way we look at pretty butterflies. They catch the male brain's attention for a second, but then they flit out of his mind. Five minutes later, while we're still fuming, he's deciding whether he wants ribs or chicken for dinner. He asks us, ""What's wrong?"" We say, ""Nothing."" He shrugs and turns on the TV. We smolder and fear that he'll leave us for another woman. Not surprisingly, the different objectives that men and women have in mating games put us on opposing teams -- at least at first. The female brain is driven to seek security and reliability in a potential mate before she has sex. But a male brain is fueled to mate and mate again. Until, that is, he mates for life. Despite stereotypes to the contrary, the male brain can fall in love just as hard and fast as the female brain, and maybe more so. When he meets and sets his sights on capturing ""the one,"" mating with her becomes his prime directive. And when he succeeds, his brain makes an indelible imprint of her. Lust and love collide and he's hooked. The 'Doting Daddy Brain' A man in hot pursuit of a mate doesn't even remotely resemble a devoted, doting daddy. But that's what his future holds. When his mate becomes pregnant, she'll emit pheromones that will waft into his nostrils, stimulating his brain to make more of a hormone called prolactin. Her pheromones will also cause his testosterone production to drop by 30 percent. These hormonal changes make him more likely to help with the baby. They also change his perceptual circuitry, increasing his ability to hear a baby cry, something many men can't do very well before their wives are pregnant. And a word to the wise for all the young mothers who are reluctant to let your husbands hold and care for your newborn. The more hands-on care a father gives his infant, the more his brain aligns with the role of fatherhood. So, hand over the baby. His emotions run deep . Although men have earned the reputation for being more stoic than women, they actually have stronger emotional reactions than we do. They just don't show it very often. Studies of men's faces show that the male brain's initial emotional reaction can be stronger than the female brain's. But within 2.5 seconds, he changes his face to hide the emotion, or even reverse it. The repeated practice of hiding his emotions gives men the classic poker face. It's his poker face and his analytical response to personal problems that can put him in the doghouse. She's crying as she talks about what's wrong with the relationship, and instead of hugging her, his mind is racing to find a way to resolve the problem as soon as possible. With practice and because of the way their brains are wired, men use their analytical brain structures, not their emotional ones, to find a solution. They enjoy this advantage, but women often take affront to it. When you're telling your husband your problem and he tries to solve it instead of hearing you out, you may think he's being insensitive. But that's not what's going on in his brain. He's working to solve the problem so he can relieve your pain as quickly as possible. Not because he doesn't care or doesn't want to listen, but because he loves you. 'Lovable Grandpas' and 'Grumpy Old Men' As men age, the male brain hormones change and the male brain and body goes into the stage of life called andropause. The king of male hormones -- testosterone -- goes down and the queen of female hormones -- estrogen -- goes up. Whether Grandpa is your kids' hero or the grouch they hate to visit depends a lot on how he handles these hormonal changes. For example, if his testosterone levels drop to an abnormally low level, he can feel tired,  irritable and even depressed. Some men in this condition seek hormone replacement therapy and others find relief in exercise, more frequent sex, and spending more time with other people. The grandpa that kids can't wait to see is the one who's feeling the effects of the hormone oxytocin, often called the ""cuddle hormone."" He's fun and playful and likes to hear what his grandchildren have to say. He's much more patient with your children than he was with you, when you were growing up. The love circuits of the mature male brain can be hijacked by his grandkids, even more than they were by his own children. The 'Lonely Hearts Club' Not only is the mature male brain more receptive to closer bonds, but it's also more sensitive to loneliness. Nobody thrives when they're lonely, but it seems to take a major toll on older men. Sixty percent of divorces in couples over the age of 50 are initiated by women, leaving their husbands shell-shocked and devastated. Once his wife leaves, unless he makes a point of socializing more with other people, his brain stops getting the social workout it needs to make him feel good about himself. If he becomes a loner, his social-approval circuits don't get activated. In brain scan studies of older males researchers have found that the brain's pleasure and reward areas, the VTA and the NAc, remain more active in men who are social. So don't begrudge the divorcee or the new widower some socializing and seeking female companionship. The bottom line . The human brain is the best learning machine on the planet and human beings are capable of making major changes in our lives. But there are some things that the male brain and female brain are not likely to change anytime soon. And it makes more sense to deal with these brain realities, than to argue with them or ignoring them. The best advice I have for women  is make peace with  the male brain. Let men be men.

"If you're following the news about ISIS, which now calls itself the Islamic State, you might think you've mistakenly clicked on a historical story about barbarians from millennia ago. In a matter of months, the group seized territory in both Iraq and Syria and declared an Islamic caliphate, celebrating its own shocking slaughter along the way. ""I don't see any attention from the rest of the world,"" a member of the Yazidi minority in Iraq told the New Yorker. ""In one day, they killed more than two thousand Yazidi in Sinjar, and the whole world says, 'Save Gaza, save Gaza.'"" In Syria, the group hoisted some of its victims severed heads on poles. One of the latest videos of the savagery shows a Christian man forced to his knees, surrounded by masked militants, identified in the video as members of ISIS.  They force the man at gunpoint to ""convert"" to Islam. Then, the group beheads him. ISIS has targeted members of numerous minority groups in the region, including Christian nuns, Turkmen and Shabaks, according to Human Rights Watch. France called Thursday for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said his country is ""highly concerned about the latest progress of ISIS in the north of Iraq and by the taking of Qaraqosh, the largest Christian city of Iraq, and the horrible acts of violence that are committed."" The United States is considering emergency air drops to help thousands of stranded Yazidis, a U.S. Defense official told CNN. The department also is weighing ""other military options,"" a senior State Department official said. Asked about the possibility of U.S. airstrikes, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday he was ""not in a position to rule things on the table or off the table."" Earlier this week, ISIS fighters tried to seize control of Iraq's largest hydroelectric dam, but Kurdish forces fended them off, the dam's director said. ""If 'IS' manages to consolidate its territory and preserve its legitimacy, an offensive jihad against all other countries will then be considered viable,"" Jonathan Russell of Qulliam, a think tank formed to combat extremism, wrote on CNN.com. ""Al Qaeda will now want to challenge ISIS's appropriation of its key objectives and tactics. The only way for al Qaeda to stay relevant now is through a violent and spectacular attack. Although ISIS may eventually be a victim of its own success, the real victims will be the thousands of innocent Muslims and non-Muslims caught in the crossfire of this millennarian struggle."" Pope leads call for action . As the tales of horror trickle out from areas ISIS controls -- including Mosul, Iraq's largest city -- a growing chorus of voices is calling on the world to act.  The most prominent is Pope Francis. ""The Holy Father follows with strong concern the dramatic news from the north of Iraq, concerning defenseless populations,"" the Vatican said in a statement Thursday. ""Particularly struck have been the Christian communities, a people fleeing from their own villages due to the violence that in these days is raging and overwhelming the region."" ""Dear brothers and sisters so persecuted, I know how much you are suffering and I know that everything has been taken from you. I am with you in faith, and with Him that has conquered evil,"" the Pope said recently during the Angelus prayer. ""His Holiness also sends an urgent appeal to the international community, in order that they may work towards ending the humanitarian crisis and protecting those who are affected or threatened by violence, and to ensure necessary aid, especially that which is most urgently needed by so many homeless, whose fate is solely dependent on the solidarity of others,"" the Vatican said. ""An entire religion is being exterminated from the face of the Earth."" Vian Dakhil, a Yazidi, said in an appeal to the Iraqi parliament. She called it a ""genocide."" Yazidis, among Iraq's smallest minorities, are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. Analysts: West must arm Kurds . ""The world now faces two urgent challenges: to prevent the genocide of the Yazidis and to stop ISIS from continuing to conquer swaths of the Middle East,"" global affairs columnist Frida Ghitis wrote on CNN.com. ""Bombing ISIS positions would help save the Yazidis, but supporting the Kurds is key to success on both counts."" The Iraqi Kurdish army, known as the Peshmerga, has fought ISIS but is ""outgunned,"" partly because the Iraqi army dropped its weapons ""and fled when ISIS rolled in from Syria and captured Mosul,"" Ghitis says. Ghitis wants the United States to help arm the Kurds against ISIS. The United States has been reluctant to do so, wary that the Kurds will try to break off from Iraq and build a separate state at a time Washingon is trying to bolster a central Iraqi government in Baghdad. ""If the U.S. decided to help the Kurds, there would be no guarantee that the Kurds wouldn't later use those weapons to further their own interests,"" Dexter Filkins writes in the New Yorker. ""But what other choice is there?"" Filkins notes that Iraq has begun air strikes aimed at helping the Kurds -- but, he says, ""the Iraqi Army has proved itself utterly ineffectual in combating ISIS."" On Wednesday, the Iraqi air force struck a building Mosul believed to be used by ISIS, killing 76 people, an Iraqi official told CNN. But local officials said dozens of those killed were actually civilians who had opposed the Islamic State. Meanwhile, Iraq's Badr Brigade Shiit militia is is training women to join men in protecting Baghdad if the Islamic State works its way to the capital. Masrour Barzani, Kurdish intelligence and security chief, called for direct military assistance from the United States in an interview with the Washington Post. ""We've got to help our allies to defend themselves,"" says David Schenker, head of the Washington Institute's Program on Arab Politics, another voice in support of arming Kurds. ""The other half of that equation is working with the moderate Syrian opposition -- providing them with robust capabilities against the regime and ISIS."" Analyst: Build a U.S. base . Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official who focuses on Arab politics and terrorism, disagrees on both fronts. At this point, ""the definition of 'moderate' in Syria is 'not engaging in cannibalism,'"" he says. ""If we did not know about two Chechen brothers in Boston before they carried out the Marathon bombings, how could we know whom to trust within Syria?"" It's too late to arm moderates as a means of curbing the violence in Syria, says Rubin, who is now with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. And among Kurds in Iraq, there's a danger: ""Kurdish leadership is just as permeated by, and just as close in terms of a working relationship with, the  Islamic Revolution Guards Corps"" -- Iran's elite force. ""In the past, the Kurds have leaked intelligence to the Iranians -- and they could presumably leak weaponry."" The Peshmerga is also not as competent as its popular image suggests Rubin says. He wants the United States to accept an offer from the Massoud Barzani, head of the Kurdistan Regional Government, to set up a base in Kurdistan. ""It would kill two birds with one stone,"" he says. The United States could base drones or manned aircraft in the region to be used in the fight against ISIS, and the U.S. presence would help cut through some of the Iranian influence. The Iraqi government wouldn't like it, ""but at this point, it's the lesser concern,"" Rubin says. ""We could mitigate this with a request to Baghdad to approve. Baghdad has more to lose by not blessing this especially if we go ahead anyway."" But Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Thursday that President Barack Obama has made clear ""there are no American military solutions to the problems in Iraq. We can't solve these problems for them. These problems can only be solved with Iraqi political solutions."" He added that Obama has ""demonstrated his clear willingness to take the kind of military action that's required to protect core American interests,"" including personnel around the globe. But any U.S. military action in Iraq would not include boots on the ground, Earnest said. ISIS's cruelty could be its downfall . But the West may have reason to take no immediate action, says Fahad Nazer, terrorism analyst with JTG Inc. ""Unlike other al Qaeda branches, ISIS doesn't seem eager to attack the West. It has too much to lose,"" he writes on CNN.com. ""While the West has never been comfortable with Hamas in Gaza or Hezbollah in Lebanon, it has largely left it up to the countries of the wider Middle East to deal with these militant, Islamist organizations,"" he writes. Also, ""The West may find solace in the fact that ISIS has many enemies in the Arab and Muslim worlds,"" Nazer writes.  And with so many groups suffering from its persecution and terror, such ""violent ideology and brutality makes its endurance over the long-term unlikely."" The West could work with populations in the region to stand up against terrorism as it did with the Iraq Awakening Councils who turned against al Qaeda in 2006, says Schenker. There's also the possibility that al Qaeda and ISIS will fight each other so heavily that they inflict casualties and weaken each other. But the risks of inaction by the West in the immediate future may be too great, says Schenker. ""ISIS digging in consolidating gains,"" he says, ""will make it much more difficult to combat in the long run."" ""Several Obama administration officials have told us that our national security is at risk from ISIS,"" adds Elliott Abrams, who served as deputy national security adviser under President George W. Bush. Abrams supports arming Kurds and says the United States should be willing to use its military power as well. ""Otherwise,"" says Abrams, who is now with the Council on Foreign Relations, ""What is the Obama message: there are huge risks, but we'll just watch for a while?"" What chance do Yazidis have against group too brutal for al Qaeda?","The White House does not say whether air strikes are an option .

"Four years ago, Patrick McStay lost everything he loved. His son, Joseph, his daughter-in-law, Summer, and their two little boys -- Gianni, 4, and Joseph Jr., 3 -- vanished. ""From Day One, I just had this gut feeling that I was never going to see them again,"" he said, swallowing tears. ""I just knew. Something told me, I wasn't going to see them again."" The McStays disappeared from their home in suburban San Diego in February 2010. There were no signs of a struggle. No apparent plan to flee. Nearly four years later, the mother, father and two boys were found slain in the Mojave Desert -- their bodies buried in shallow graves. How did they get there? Who killed them? From the beginning, the case has baffled investigators, but they aren't giving up. Said John McMahon, sheriff of San Bernardino County, in an exclusive interview with CNN: ""It is certainly my hope that at some point in the future, we'll be able to solve this, and bring the suspect or suspects to justice."" McStay's brother to killers: 'You guys are cowards' The disappearance . February 4, 2010, began as an ordinary day in the McStay home in Fallbrook, a community of about 30,000 people about 18 miles from the Pacific Coast and 50 miles north of San Diego. Patrick McStay spoke on the phone with his son, who ran a custom water feature business, and was scheduled to have a lunch meeting around noon. Summer McStay spent the day caring for the kids and overseeing the family's home renovation. They were looking forward to their youngest son's birthday party that weekend. But that night, the family of four suddenly left the house -- the doors locked, the car gone. Inexplicably, their two beloved dogs were left outside without food or water. ""(It's) as if you took off really fast but were coming back,"" said Susan Blake, Joseph McStay's mother, who is divorced from Patrick McStay. ""Your thoughts are going wild. 'Well, why would they be missing?' Something's not right here,"" she said. The investigation . Early evidence pointed investigators south. Four days after the McStays disappeared, detectives say the family's white Isuzu Trooper was parked and subsequently towed from a parking lot just steps from the Mexican border. And the car wasn't the only clue. After they found the Isuzu, investigators discovered someone at the McStay home had done a computer search for getting passports to Mexico. They also found surveillance video showing a family of four matching the McStays' description crossing on foot into Mexico on February 8. ""I just thought, well, maybe they took off,"" said Joseph's mother. But his father wasn't buying it. ""I said right up front, the first time I saw it (the surveillance footage), it wasn't them,"" said Patrick McStay, adding that Summer was afraid of Mexico. ""Would Summer take her two children in there? Heck, no,"" he said. Missed opportunities . Patrick McStay worried detectives were chasing dead-end clues. ""I could have probably hired some Boy Scouts and done a better job,"" he said. He reached out to Tim Miller, founder of the nonprofit search-and-rescue organization Texas Equusearch, which, in turn, contacted freelance investigative journalist Steph Watts for help. One point that raised questions for Watts was the last known call from Joseph McStay's cell phone. The call was to a friend, Chase Merritt. It came in about 40 minutes after a neighbor's security camera captured the family's Isuzu pulling out of the McStay's cul-de-sac. Merritt didn't answer. Among those questions, Watts said, were, ""Did Joseph actually make that call from his phone, or did somebody else take Joseph's phone and make that call? Was he trying to call for help?"" The journalist also noted the impact of the delay in reporting the family missing to law enforcement. Joseph's brother contacted authorities 11 days after the McStays disappeared. He says he waited because he didn't want to overreact, and thought the family might just be on vacation. ""The first few hours are so critical, the first few minutes ... The beginning of someone trying to commit a crime against you, that's the only chance you have to get out,"" Watts said. 2013: Who were the McStays? The bodies . The call the family feared finally came in November 2013, from an off-roading motorcyclist in the Mojave Desert. More than 150 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, and some 100 miles north of the McStay home, the biker found what looked to be part of a human skull in a remote area of Victorville, California. Authorities investigated and found four skeletons in two shallow graves. With the help of dental records, they determined the bodies belonged to the McStays. Once considered a missing persons case, the investigation moved to homicide. It also switched jurisdictions -- passing from the San Diego County Sheriff's Department to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Jan Caldwell, with the San Diego department, defended her office's handling of the case. ""This is an incredibly thorough investigation,"" she said, her hand atop a thick stacks of files. ""Thumbing through it, I can see phone records, I see photographs, I see communications. ""And to have done all of this -- to have compiled this kind of a massive file and still not know the answer -- enormously frustrating,"" Caldwell said last year, soon after the remains were discovered. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department is no longer commenting on the case. It refers all questions to San Bernardino, which declines to get into specifics, citing the ongoing investigation. Summer's mother, brother and sister also declined to comment to CNN. The mystery . Detectives still have not named any suspects or persons of interest. ""There was certainly evidence found in and around the grave sites, but at this point we're not prepared to talk about what evidence we did locate,"" said McMahon, the San Bernardino sheriff. Watts said the only way the case will be cracked now is if someone talks. ""There was more than one person involved in this case because not one person dragged four people out to the desert and buried them single-handedly,"" he said. ""As the pieces begin to come together, it's looking to me like it was extremely orchestrated. So we have to ask ourselves, why?"" Like Watts, Patrick McStay believes the killer, or killers, has to be someone who hated his family for a reason -- but that reason is unclear. So many theories. So many questions. So few answers. ""It's like a play. The first act has just ended. We've got three more acts to go,"" he said.","Joseph and Summer McStay, and their two boys, vanished from home in February 2010 .

"The history of television is a history of insults. The idiot box, it's been called. The boob tube. ""57 Channels (and Nothin' On)."" ""Kill your television"" says the bumper sticker. In 1961, it was famously deemed a ""vast wasteland."" After all, there were just three TV networks at the time. Most major cities didn't have public television stations (PBS was still years away). And the UHF band, where independent stations would later flourish, was barely used. The first communications satellite didn't go up until 1962. And the content? With few exceptions, the networks carried mostly dumbed-down, formulaic cop shows, Westerns, situation comedies and musical-variety programs. News was something people got from newspapers. ""It was a very limited choice,"" says Newton Minow, the former Federal Communications Commission chairman who coined the ""vast wasteland"" phrase in his 1961 speech to the National Association of Broadcasters and has heard it repeated regularly over the last five decades. Times have changed, right? Actually, yes, says TV critic Eric Deggans. Of the many flaws of '60s entertainment TV, he says, a major one was that it didn't reflect what was going on in America, whether it was the civil rights movement or the escalation of the Vietnam War. ""Back then, there was a lot of TV that was created by producers who really underestimated the audience,"" Deggans says. New Day: 5 things Dick Cavett misses about '60s TV (including: No Kardashians) As the decade continued, television gingerly addressed some social change but certainly nothing like what was to come -- first in the 1970s with such Norman Lear sitcoms as ""All in the Family"" and ""Sanford and Son"" and in more recent years, novelistic shows such as ""Breaking Bad."" TV: The new, new golden age . In fact, Deggans says even today's widely popular sitcoms and dramas, such as ""Parenthood,"" engage with real life in ways that were forbidden 50 years ago. That's true even with ""The Walking Dead,"" an end-of-the-world horror show about zombies. ""What it's really about is man's inhumanity to man, and when something happens and all the chips are down, how do you respond as a human being?"" he says, referring to ""The Walking Dead."" ""When you think about what's going on in Nigeria or the Arab Spring or Syria, that's real life."" Moreover, even the more formulaic shows don't take their viewers for granted. ""I don't think any of those shows pander to their audience in the way that a show like 'Petticoat Junction' or 'Gilligan's Island' did,"" he says. ""Those were classic comedies, but they were really, really simple. A show like 'NCIS' is absolutely about all these issues we're struggling with as a society."" Ironically, Minow's 1961 speech was somewhat taken out of context. He actually praised the medium before lowering the boom: ""When television is good, nothing -- not the theater, not the magazines or newspapers -- nothing is better,"" he said. His concern that TV wasn't properly serving the public is what prompted his criticism. Indeed, the speech was titled ""Television in the Public Interest."" The last half-century has been mostly positive, says Minow today -- and he observes that the federal government played a positive role in that growth. Minow, now 88 and an attorney in Chicago, was instrumental in requiring television sets to include a UHF dial and promoting the use of communications satellites. ""I felt that the basic role of the government was to expand choice, because the government should not be in the business of deciding what's on the air,"" he says. ""I think the expansion of choice was the government's main contribution."" He does have some concerns, however, about the increasing consolidation of the communications industry over the last 50 years. ""I think the idea of having local ownership has pretty much disappeared,"" he says. But he shrugs, ""The horse is out of the barn."" Massive mergers planned for TV providers . Deggans notes, however, that despite the corporatization of media, there's still a much broader range than in the '60s -- or even in the '90s. After all, 50 years ago we had three networks. Now there's cable, the Internet is a major player allowing for video streaming, and technology lets anybody ""broadcast themselves,"" to borrow YouTube's old slogan. They can choose when to watch, too. Yes, TV is still belittled. But the argument flows both ways. After his speech, Minow was tweaked by ""Gilligan's Island"" producer Sherwood Schwartz, who made the FCC chairman the namesake of a certain shipwrecked boat. Minow appreciated the gesture. ""I told him I considered it a great compliment,"" he says. ""It exposed my name to two generations of television viewers.""","In 1961, FCC Chairman Newton Minow deemed TV a ""vast wasteland""

"It was a ""Lucky"" night for Daft Punk. The robot-headed duo won record of the year for the hit ""Get Lucky"" and album of the year for ""Random Access Memories"" at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards Sunday night. Daft Punk was typically silent, but singer-songwriter Paul Williams accepted the album of the year award with a generous speech. Williams, who's written such songs as ""We've Only Just Begun"" and ""Evergreen,"" had struggled to overcome substance abuse problems over the years. ""Then I get sober and two robots asked me to make an album,"" he said. Pharrell Williams, who sang on ""Get Lucky,"" accepted the award for record of the year. Five things we loved about the awards . The Grammys also often manage to single out rising artists, and this year that meant Lorde, Kacey Musgraves and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. Lorde earned the third of the big three awards, song of the year, for ""Royals."" The honor is a songwriters' award. ""Thank you to everyone who has let the song explode,"" she said, also paying tribute to co-writer Joel Little. She also won a Grammy for best pop solo performance. Musgraves won for best country album. Macklemore & Lewis, who were nominated for seven awards, won four at Grammy Awards. ""I want to thank our fans, the people that got us on this stage,"" said Macklemore in accepting the award for best new artist. The pair also took home rap album (""The Heist""), rap performance and rap song (both for ""Thrift Shop""). Macklemore & Lewis beat out some tough competition in the rap categories. Their album was up against offerings from Drake and Kendrick Lamar, and ""Thrift Shop"" defeated songs by Jay Z and Kanye West. The winners' list: Did you pick them? Jay Z, who led all artists with nine nominations, did win best rap/sung collaboration for ""Holy Grail,"" a collaboration with Justin Timberlake. Addressing his daughter Blue, Jay Z said, ""Daddy just got a gold sippy cup for you."" Macklemore & Lewis' ""Same Love,"" a song written in support of same-sex marriage, was performed on a set resembling a church. Macklemore's rap was followed by a mass wedding featuring 33 couples taking the stage of Los Angeles' Staples Center. Queen Latifah officiated, and Madonna served as maid of honor, following Latifah's exhortions with ""Open Your Heart."" The crowd roared its approval as the couples made their way back up the aisle. Trent Reznor, Macklemore tell us how they really feel . The show was full of such notable performances. A highlight was a performance of ""Get Lucky"" featuring Pharrell Williams, Stevie Wonder, Nile Rodgers and song originators Daft Punk, who lurked in a ""control room"" in their robot helmets. ""Get Lucky"" won a Grammy for pop duo/group performance, and Daft Punk won two early Grammys for its album ""Random Access Memories,"" one for its engineering, the other in the dance electronic category. Daft Punk won five Grammys, total. Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, who received a Lifetime Achievement Award for their work with the Beatles, both played. Starr did his ""Photograph"" with musicians including Peter Frampton and Kenny Aronoff, and McCartney did his new song ""Queenie Eye"" with a group that included Starr. Most awards were given out before the show. Stars rock all-white ensembles . Adele, a big winner two years ago, won yet another Grammy, this time for her ""Skyfall"" theme song. Other winners include Ziggy Marley (reggae album); Stephen Colbert (spoken word); and Terri Lyne Carrington (jazz instrumental album). Gold and black dominated the gowns on the red carpet, though Paris Hilton -- in a side-baring white number -- was among the most showy. Producer and vocalist Pharrell Williams, who showed up wearing an oversized forest ranger-style hat, earned plenty of fashion attention on Twitter. In fact, @PharrellHat had more than 5,000 followers and @PharrellsHat had more than 400 within an hour of the show starting. Perhaps someone will not start an account for ""robot heads.""

"The United States' delegation to the upcoming Winter Olympics in Russia won't include a member of President Barack Obama's family or an active Cabinet secretary, but it will include openly gay athletes - a clear jab at Russia's recent anti-gay laws. Billie Jean King, the tennis legend, will join figure skater Brian Boitano at the games' opening ceremonies on February 7, the White House said Tuesday. Former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, White House aide Rob Nabors and the U.S. ambassador to Russia will round out the delegation to the Sochi games. King was one of the first professional athletes to come out as gay in the 1980s. Two weeks later, a group led by Deputy Secretary of State William Burns will attend the closing ceremony. Speed skaters Bonnie Blair and Eric Heiden, as well as openly gay hockey player Caitlin Cahow, will also attend. Cahow, 28, is a two-time Olympian. ""In the selection of this delegation, we are sending the message that the United States is a diverse place,"" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday, pointing to Napolitano, a former Cabinet secretary, as evidence of the delegation's distinction. It's the first time in more than a decade the President, vice president, first lady or former president hasn't attended an Olympic opening or closing ceremony. First lady Michelle Obama led the delegation to 2012's Summer Olympics in London, and President George W. Bush made the trek to China for Beijing's games in 2008. Vice President Joe Biden and his wife led a U.S. group to the last Winter Games, held in Vancouver. The absence of high-ranking U.S. officials amounts to a snub to Russia, whose relationship with the United States has fractured over the past year. Admitted NSA leaker Edward Snowden, wanted on espionage charges in the United States, was granted temporary asylum in Moscow, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has used Russia's veto on the United Nations Security Council to block action in Syria. Russia to set up protest zones at Winter Olympics . Obama canceled a meeting with Putin that was scheduled for September, though the two met as part of a larger group of world leaders at the Group of 20 conference in St. Petersburg. Fueling the rift between the nations are new laws in Russia banning gay ""propaganda"" -- a law critics say is so vague that anyone can be prosecuted for wearing a rainbow T-shirt or holding hands in public with someone of the same sex. Carney noted on Wednesday the selection of gay athletes wasn't the first time Obama has voiced concern over the Russian policy. ""That's not a message we would wait to send through this manner,"" Carney said. ""We have been very clear -- the President has been very clear that he finds it offensive, the anti-LGBT legislation in Russia."" Obama told Jay Leno in August he had ""no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them,"" and during his visit to Russia earlier this year, Obama met with the leaders of Russian social activist groups.

"Marque Cornblatt's interest in drones began with a bit of playful drone-on-drone violence. He began attending ""Fight Club""-like meetups in the Bay Area where enthusiasts pit the amateur flying machines against each other in bloodless battles of strength and flying technique. ""We were beginners, so just getting off the ground caused damage,"" Cornblatt said of the dogfights, which were won by whichever drone lasted the longest and got back up in the air fastest. And so the idea for an ""indestructible"" drone design was born. Cornblatt, along with Eli D'Elia, started Game of Drones. Using an extremely durable plastic called Kydex, the company creates inexpensive but rugged drones capable of surviving everything from high-impact crashes to shotgun blasts. For many, the word ""drone"" still conjures images of military strikes or a near-future retail fleet delivering packages or pizzas. But while commercial uses of unmanned aerial vehicles are banned while tangled up in federal regulations, a growing number of drone enthusiasts are embracing the still-young technology as a creative new pursuit. The result is a lively community of hobbyists, entrepreneurs and aerial photographers, some of whom gathered this week for a picnic and flying demonstration in a suburban field south of Napa. The ""drone fly-in"" event was the brainchild of Make magazine, which is celebrating a new all-drone issue. ""The technology is still very much in the hands of the do-it-yourselfers and the enthusiasts,"" said Mike Senese, Make's executive editor. Rise of the DIY drones . The Maker movement, with its legions of tinkerers, is an ideal community to embrace drones. The DIY drone technology has grown organically from existing popular maker interests, including micro-controllers, robotics and radio-controlled vehicles. Drones combine all those disciplines to create advanced and programmable versions of what look like toy helicopters. The most practical and popular use for the devices is aerial photography. Lightweight cameras like GoPros can be affixed to drones such as the DJI Phantom quadcopter or the forthcoming $750 Iris from 3D Robotics. Specialized drone rigs can even hold larger professional cameras. Soaring up to several hundred feet above the ground produces some unbeatable angles. But to get a perfect shot, hobbyists program their drones with precise routes and mount the cameras on gimbals, which keep the camera steady and pointed in one direction even as the drone moves about. ""For us, drones means 'capable of autonomy,'"" said Chris Anderson, founder of 3D Robotics and the former editor of Wired magazine. Being able to program an exact path for a drone instead of manually steering it is what makes the technology so promising for commercial and photography use, enthusiasts say. Experimenting and making . Playing pilot is part of the fun for hobbyists. Just as there are a variety of uses for drones, there's a number of ways to steer them. The more traditional controls are hand-held joysticks and knobs. More advanced controlling can be done through computers and increasingly, tablets and smartphones, although some purists claim the touchscreens lack the tactile satisfaction of physical controls. A startup called Fighting Walrus is working on a $129 accessory (it bears a slight resemblance to walrus tusks) that clips onto the end of an iPad and can be used to control standard, mid-range drones over a radio connection. With the app, you can program a route and monitor the device's flight progress, though full manual controls are coming in a future update. The most immersive, and arguably most fun, way to pilot a drone is through first-person view (FPV). A small camera is affixed to the front of the drone, and a person on the ground views a live stream from the drone's point of view though a pair of goggles. Users can control the drone's direction in real time, which  feels similar to piloting an aircraft from inside a cockpit. Some enthusiasts even use FPV setups for drone races. Many drones are square quadcopters and it can be difficult to tell which way they're facing at any given time. The FPV live stream clears up any confusion, though sometimes it's tricky to find a downed drone when you didn't see where it landed. Flying under the radar . The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to complete standards and rules for commercial drones by late 2015, though senators and lobbyists are pushing for an earlier deadline. Until the FAA clears drones for flight in general airspace, the devices are only allowed to be flown for recreation and below 400 feet. Manufacturers of professional drones are stuck on the sidelines for the time being, but this has left the door open for hobbyists to experiment and invent. The consumer-first approach might help pave the way for more widespread acceptance of commercial drones whenever they take to the air. Some enterprising drone companies are already doing business while avoiding the glare of the FAA. Aerial drone photographers are selling their services to real estate companies and the movie and TV industry. Journalists have used the devices to capture footage of news events. A handful of people have been sent cease and desist letters from the FAA. Because they can be outfitted with cameras, microphones and other surveillance equipment, drones will no doubt be used by law enforcement. But such drones will have to battle public privacy concerns in the U.S. ""People decide what they're comfortable with,"" said Anderson, who pointed out that it will continue to be illegal to fly drones over built-up areas like housing or cities. Play on . Drones, called UAVs by large companies and industry groups, are expected to be a $89 billion business worldwide in the next decade,according to the Teal Group. For example, agriculture will be a huge market for the devices, which could allow famers to monitor crops autonomously. For now, inventors and hobbyists are enjoying improving the technology while waiting for the commercial industry to catch up. Photographers are skirting around regulations, companies are selling new commercial models in the U.S. and in countries with more relaxed regulations, and the Game of Drones guys are busy with their high-tech endurance tests. ""I took [the drone] out into the wasteland with a baseball bat and my anger,"" said Cornblatt. ""I've wanted to destroy them but I've been unable to do so, so I decided to sell them.""","While commercial drones wait on FAA approval, a lively hobbyist community takes to the air .

"Going off-road used to mean tearing up dirt tracks in a powerful four-by-four or gigantic monster truck. For two ambitious tech start-ups however, the term has come to comprise something more subtle and potentially revolutionary. For the past 18 months Matternet  and Aria -- separate companies born out of the the same Silicon Valley incubator -- have been working towards creating a roving network of automated drones that will help connect rural and under-developed areas with little access to existing road or highway systems. While the idea may sound far-fetched to those unfamiliar with the latest in civilian drone technology, preliminary vehicle testing has already taken place. See also: Where is the world's best airport? ""The easiest way to describe what we are doing is to compare how mobile telephony has taken off in the developing world,"" said Matternet founder and CEO, Andreas Raptopoulos. ""(We want) to leapfrog the traditional modes of transportation infrastructure in a similar way and bring items through these unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to people who may otherwise be cut off or isolated,"" he added. A network of drones . The idea stems from when Raptopoulos led a research group including the company's three other co-founders at the Singularity University in Silicon Valley. They envisioned employing a fleet of drones with a two kilogram payload capacity and a six mile flight-range. These automated vehicles would be complemented on the ground by a vast network of strategically positioned hubs, enabling drones to recharge their batteries every few miles before continuing to the next station (where the recharging process is repeated) or final destination. Control of the drones and the assignment of packages for delivery would eventually be handled by an automated operating system. Orders or requests could then be placed and paid for by cell phone. The potential applications, Raptopoulos explained, include delivery of medicines to disconnected areas, enabling farmers to supply products directly to customers and providing vital materials to areas cut off by natural disasters. In the future, he adds, the concept could also be adapted to enhance the transport or distribution systems of large cities. See also: The lion city roars . So far, Matternet have reached the stage of conducting initial trials of ""quadrocopter"" drones, which took place in Haiti and the Dominican Republic last year. While happy with the results, Raptopolous believes the concept needs more testing before commercial or civilian deployment can be considered. Internet of actual things . Meanwhile  Aria (Autonomous Roadless Intelligent Array) -- set up by students from the same Singularity University class but concentrating more on developing an open source system and ground network -- intends to develop an autonomous aerial system to service this year's Burning Man festival in Nevada. According to Aria co-founder, Arturo Pelayo, a hyper-connected UAV network creates the possibility of a physical delivery system so dense and interconnected that is in effect an ""analogue internet."" ""On the internet you send digital packages. On the analogue internet you are still sending packages but these are physical,"" he said. ""We see the opportunity to create these very flexible networks serviced by these systems and ground hubs (which could even be something as basic as a disused shipping container) over very large areas,"" he added. See also: Is the Danube Romania's 'blue motorway' As the technology develops further, Pelayo believes they will overcome the drones' principle limitations -- namely the short distances they can travel and small weight they are able to carry. He also highlights cost benefits as a significant factor in making the technology attractive to potential users. Counting the cost . Raptopolous agrees and points to a case study carried out at the Singularity University of the Maseru district in the tiny African kingdom of Lesotho, which put the price of a network of 50 base-stations and 150 drones at just $900,000 -- comparing favorably against $1 million for a two kilometer, one-lane road. But while enthusiastic about these figures Raptopolous emphasizes that he doesn't see drones replacing roads or highways any time soon. Roads, after all, still carry the obvious benefit of being able to transport people and cater for much larger and heavier loads. ""The idea of Matternet is not to replace systems where they work well but really to complement them,"" he said. External factors such as how small drones perform in bad weather, how they interact with other aircraft as well as public perceptions of devices best known for their operation in a military theater will also have to be overcome, he admits. On top of this, the fact that drones could be adapted to transport illicit materials such as drugs is also something that must be considered. This is a point addressed by associate professor of aviation at the University of North Dakota, Ben Trapnell. However, he noted that while such networks could theoretically be abused in such a way it would be foolish to disregard the ""host of societal and economic benefits"" they could provide.","Matternet and Aria are exploring the possibility of dense drone networks that could deliver goods to remote areas .
The idea is to connect regions or towns where roads are unreliable or do not reach .

"Canada's largest airline announced Monday it has suspended flights to and from Venezuela capital Caracas as violent protests continue in the country. ""Due to ongoing civil unrest in Venezuela, Air Canada can no longer ensure the safety of its operation and has suspended flights to Caracas until further notice,"" said the airline in a statement. Air Canada said its last flight departed Caracas on Sunday, March 16. Prior to the suspension, Air Canada operated three return flights per week between Toronto and Caracas. The airline said customers holding tickets for later flights will receive a refund. ""Air Canada will continue to monitor the situation and will evaluate the re-introduction of flights with the objective of resuming operations on the route once Air Canada is satisfied that the situation in Venezuela has stabilized,"" said the statement. For more than a month demonstrators have been clashing with security forces in Venezuela, marking the biggest threat President Nicolas Maduro has faced since his election last year. Students and other anti-government protestors are unhappy with Venezuela's economy and rising crime. Despite being one of the world's top 10 oil-producing countries, more than 25% of Venezuelans live below the poverty line. More than 20 people have been killed during the demonstrations, according to government figures. IATA: Venezuela not playing by the rules . Air Canada's cancellation of its Caracas services comes amid a financial dispute between airlines and Venezuela's government. International Air Transport Association's CEO Tony Tyler said in a speech March 12 that the Venezuelan government is stopping airlines from repatriating around $3.7 billion in earnings. For several months, airlines have reportedly been unable to access money earned in ticket sales in Venezuela due to the company's tight currency controls. Ecuadorean flag carrier Tame suspended flights to Venezuela for three days in January over blocked payments. ""It is unacceptable that the Venezuelan government is not playing by the rules to which it is treaty bound,"" said Tyler. ""The impact of this blocked cash is quite easily seen when you consider that airlines this year will only make $18.7 billion globally. Of course this is cash and not pure profit. ""Airlines certainly cannot sustain operations indefinitely if they can't get paid. I have written to President Maduro asking for his urgent attention to this issue."" According to a report by Venezuela's Spanish-language daily el Nacional, Maduro told reporters on March 14 that any airline that pulls its operations from the country will not be allowed to return while he's in power.","Citing safety concerns, Air Canada suspended all flights to Venezuela .

"Cats and dogs in Venezuela may soon get a taste of the South American country's brand of socialism. President Nicolas Maduro announced plans Sunday to consider controlling pet food prices as part of efforts to help street animals. Price controls have become a staple of Venezuela's economic policies, drawing praise from supporters of Maduro and his government who say they make items more affordable for the poor. Opponents have sharply criticized such policies, arguing that they fuel goods shortages and harm businesses. Maduro mentioned the possibility of capping pet food prices after he announced the construction of six new veterinary centers and adopted a stray cat on government television at an event Sunday for the Mision Nevado, an animal-rights project named after a dog once owned by Latin American liberator Simon Bolivar. Maduro said national and international media, which gave extensive coverage to the slaying of a well-known beauty queen and actress in Venezuela last week, would likely ignore the news. ""Everything that is good, that is beautiful, that we do in Venezuela is ignored by the media. ... Tomorrow you will not find any summary in the press,"" he said. ""They are going to hide it. The media always hides the good of Venezuela.""","Venezuela's president says the country may control pet food prices .

"Iran on Saturday welcomed the rescue of 13 Iranian sailors by a U.S. Navy ship, calling it a ""humanitarian act."" The sailors were on a fishing boat that had been hijacked by pirates in the Arabian Sea, near the Strait of Hormuz. According to the Navy, a helicopter from the destroyer USS Kidd spotted a suspect pirate boat alongside the Iranian vessel on Thursday. The destroyer is part of the USS John Stennis Strike Group, which moved into the Arabian Sea from the Persian Gulf last week. As the helicopter spotted the suspect pirate ship, the Kidd received a distress call from the fishing boat's captain, saying pirates were holding him and his crew captive. A team from the Kidd boarded the vessel, took 15 suspected pirates into custody, and freed 13 Iranian hostages, the Navy said. A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry, Ramin Mehmanparast, had positive words about the rescue when he spoke Saturday to the Arabic news network Al-Alam. ""Rescuing Iranian sailors by the U.S. was a humanitarian act and we welcome such acts,"" he said. ""The Iranian Navy also engages in such rescue operations. It is the responsibility of all nations to rescue nationals from other countries from pirates."" The carrier strike group's presence in the Persian Gulf had drawn the ire of Iranian military officials, who said the United States should not send any more warships into the Gulf. Iranian Brig. Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said ""there is no need"" for countries outside of the region to have a presence there. ""Their presence does nothing but create mayhem,"" Vahidi said, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. The suspected pirates, mostly Somalis, were taken to the Stennis to be held until a decision is made about prosecution, Pentagon spokesman Capt. John Kirby said Friday. Pirates hijacked the fishing vessel, the Al Molai, 40 to 45 days ago, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said in a statement. The crew was ""held hostage, with limited rations and we believe were forced against their will to assist the pirates with other piracy operations,"" according to the statement. The Navy team provided food, water and medical care to both the suspected pirates and the Al Molai's crew after securing the ship and ensuring everyone was safe, said Josh Schminky, a Navy Criminal Investigative Service agent aboard the Kidd. The crew had ""been through a lot,"" he said, adding, ""We went out of our way to treat the fishing crew with kindness and respect."" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Friday congratulated the strike group commander, Rear Adm. Craig Faller, and his team on the rescue, saying they did the right thing. ""When we get a distress signal, we're going to respond. That's the nature of what our country is all about,"" Panetta said, according to Pentagon spokesman George Little.","The destroyer USS Kidd rescued 13 Iranian sailors Thursday .

"Chris Christie's administration got outside legal help on Thursday as a special state legislative committee decided to issue 20 subpoenas to launch its formal investigation of a scandal over alleged political retribution by top aides to the New Jersey governor. The subpoenas for 17 individuals and three organizations seek documents for now, said Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski, chairman of the panel. He refused to identify any recipients, saying they should learn of their subpoenas through being served instead of the news media. But CNN has obtained some of the names of those subpoenaed, including top current and former Christie administration officials. According to a source familiar with the subpoenas, among those served are: Kevin O'Dowd, Christie's chief of staff, David Samson, a close adviser, Bridget Anne Kelly, former deputy chief of staff, Bill Stepien, two-time Christie campaign manager, Charlie McKenna, Christie's chief counsel, Regina Egea, incoming chief of staff, Michael Drewniak, Christie's chief spokesman, Nicole Davidman Drewniak, Bill Baroni, top New Jersey official at Port Authority and Christie appointee, Patrick Foye, Port Authority executive director, Maria Comella, Colin Reed and Matt Mowers. The committee is also looking at entities that had to do with the governor's re-election, the source said. Christie fired Kelly and asked Stepien to leave his political operation after last week's release of explosive e-mails on the scandal. One name not on the list so far is Christie, as Wisniewski said there was ""no intention"" to subpoena the Republican governor at this time because no documents made public so far showed a ""direct link"" to him. Christie's office announced earlier his administration retained an outside law firm to help deal with the scandal involving traffic gridlock around the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee last September. E-mails made public last week suggested the lane closures that caused four days of jammed roads were orchestrated by top Christie aides to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee for not endorsing the governor's re-election. Also Thursday, the New Jersey Senate announced its own investigation in coordination with Wisniewski's panel, widening the political response to the controversial closing of access lanes to the nation's busiest bridge. U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman is also looking into the bridge matter, bringing the total number of investigations to four, including an internal review by Christie's office. Christie has promised cooperation with ""appropriate"" investigations of the matter, which could harm the presidential ambitions of the early front-runner for the Republican nomination in 2016. Can Christie change the subject? He appeared to refer to the scandal when he told a Thursday morning event involving Superstorm Sandy recovery efforts that ""no one, I can assure you, ever told me or anyone on my team that it was going to be easy."" ""Whatever test they put in front of me, I will meet those tests,"" Christie said to applause. Separately, a source close to Christie said the governor believes the investigations into the scandal will be a long process. Christie does not intend to address the controversy in his inaugural address after he gets sworn in for a second term next week, the source told CNN's Dana Bash on condition of not being identified. Documents made public last week suggested that top staffers in Christie's administration orchestrated the traffic logjam in Fort Lee as payback for the failure of the town's Democratic mayor to endorse the governor for re-election. Those served will have two weeks to supply the requested documents, Wisniewski said, adding he expected his committee to meet again in mid-February to consider what it had received and possible next steps. Ad firm head: We were asked about using Christie in post-Sandy campaign . Christie said last week he knew nothing about any decision by aides to close highway lanes as political punishment, but Wisniewski and other Democrats label such a scenario as implausible. The traffic gridlock occurred two months before Christie was re-elected to a second term. In a document made public Thursday by Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said a traffic study initially cited as the reason for the lane closures was an ""aberrational"" event conducted outside normal protocol. The authority's response to questions from Rockefeller also said Christie's top appointee to the Port Authority leadership, David Wildstein, ordered the lane closures and suggested that he failed to heed warnings about their impact. In addition, Wildstein ordered a Port Authority manager ""not to communicate information about the lane reduction"" to officials in Fort Lee and indicated ""he would control the communication about the toll lane closures,"" according to the response. Wildstein resigned from the Port Authority late last year as the controversy unfolded. Despite polls showing Christie as the early favorite for the Republican presidential nomination two years from now, the bridge crisis has grabbed national attention and forced the normally combative governor to adopt a more conciliatory posture. ""Gov. Christie made clear last week that he will conduct an internal review to uncover the facts surrounding the lane closures in Fort Lee,"" his office said Thursday. ""His administration is fully cooperating with the U.S. attorney inquiry and other appropriate inquiries and requests for information."" The Christie administration has retained Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP as outside counsel in a move the administration hopes ""will bring an outside, third party perspective to the situation."" Opinion: Is Christie presidential? Randy Mastro, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, will head the legal team. Mastro has experience in organized crime cases and led the federal racketeering lawsuit that forced the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to hold democratic elections and to undergo court supervision. Mastro also is a former deputy mayor of New York. On the other side, the Democratic-led State Assembly panel investigating the scandal will be assisted by attorney Reid Schar, a key figure in the federal prosecution of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. On Tuesday, Christie addressed the scandal briefly in his State of the State address, saying ""mistakes were clearly made."" He also tried to shift the focus to policy initiatives, repeatedly imploring Democrats to work with him. The allegation of political payback first made by Democrats was subsequently magnified by e-mails that state legislators released last week. Kelly's name appeared in e-mails with Wildstein, including one in which she wrote: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" Other exchanges suggested that Stepien was aware of the maneuvering that led to traffic gridlock. While the e-mails do not link Drewniak, the governor's spokesman, to the traffic jam scandal or even suggest it, they indicate that he had dinner with Wildstein two days before the transportation official resigned. Wildstein thanked Drewniak for his ""sound advice,"" and the two men later e-mailed back and forth about how to announce his departure from the Port Authority. Federal officials also are looking at New Jersey's use of $25 million in Superstorm Sandy relief funds for a marketing campaign promoting the Jersey Shore's recovery that featured Christie and his family. In a statement Monday, Christie's office said the ""Stronger than the Storm"" campaign was part of an ""action plan"" approved by the Obama administration and developed with the goal of showing that the New Jersey Shore was open for business several months after the storm that devastated parts of the mid-Atlantic in October 2012. The campaign took place the same year that Christie was running for re-election. On Tuesday, the federal Housing and Urban Development agency described the investigation as a routine audit ""and not an investigation of the procurement process.""

"A report made public Thursday on events surrounding the deadly shooting spree at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009 provides new details on the failure of anti-terrorism officials to act on e-mail traffic between Maj. Nidal Hasan and major terrorist figure Anwar al-Awlaki. The 173-page report by William Webster, a former FBI and CIA director, describes FBI policies and procedures that failed to prevent the shooting spree. Hasan is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder. Read the full report . The FBI and Defense Department were stunned by the shootings, and FBI Director Robert Mueller ordered a detailed review by the Webster commission, which Mueller appointed. According to the commission's report, in a May 31, 2009, e-mail from Hasan to al-Awlaki's website, Hasan discussed his views on suicide bombings. E-mail details: Hasan sought guidance on Islam, dating . ""I would assume that a suicide bomber whose aim is to kill enemy soldiers or their helpers but also kill innocents in the process is acceptable.""   Less than six months later, officials say, Hasan jumped on a desk at Fort Hood, armed with two pistols, and began firing as he yelled ""Allahu Akbar,"" Arabic for ""God is great."" There were 18 e-mail messages between Hasan and al-Awlaki between December 2008 and June 2009, the report said.  A Joint Terrorism Task Force in San Diego that was investigating al-Awlaki passed two of the messages on to another task force in the Washington, D.C., area, where Hasan was living. Opinion: A tribute to Fort Hood's fallen . The report said the e-mails between Hasan and al-Awlaki should have been passed by the FBI in the Washington Field Office to the Defense Department bosses for whom Hasan worked. But the FBI saw no evidence of terrorist activities in his case, and believed the information in the e-mails was too sensitive to share because visiting extremist websites is not grounds for taking action. Remembering the victims . The report also said there was no clear system in place to determine which office would follow up on a particular lead and to make sure leads would be followed in a timely manner. In a statement Thursday, the FBI acknowledged ""shortcomings in FBI policy guidance, technology, information review protocols and training."" The FBI said it had reviewed 18 recommendations in the report and ""has already taken action to implement them."" Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, said the report confirms many of the findings of his committee's earlier review. He said he is pleased ""for the first time the report declassifies the communications between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki so that all Ameriicans, especially the families of the victims, can understand Hasan's radicalization and the full scale of the tragedy for which he is responsible."" Lieberman added, ""We are concerned that the report fails to address the specific cause for the Fort Hood attack, which is violent Islamist extremism"" Hasan is scheduled to be tried in a military court in Texas.

"(CNN) -- Russia's top diplomat said Thursday the nation will permit NATO to move armored vehicles through Russia to Afghanistan, state-run Russian media said. ""The eased transit regulations have been extended to armored vehicles with anti-mine protection,"" Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said after discussions in Moscow, Russia, with Afghan foreign minister Zalmay Rasul, according to state-run RIA Novosti. At the NATO summit in Lisbon, Portugal, last week, Russia and the alliance agreed to ""broadened transit arrangements through Russian territory"" of ""non-lethal"" material. The cargo would be moved through Russia to and from Afghanistan. ""We underlined the importance of international efforts in support of the Afghan government and in promoting regional peace and stability. In that context, the revised arrangements aimed at further facilitating railway transit of non-lethal ISAF goods through Russian territory are of particular value,"" the NATO-Russia Council Joint Statement said Saturday. The agreement will help NATO's International Security Force break its dependency on Pakistani authorities to allow supplies and vehicles to get through. Pakistan last month temporarily closed the main land route for NATO supplies crossing from Pakistan to Afghanistan after U.S. helicopter strikes across the border killed two Pakistani soldiers. Dmitry Rogozin, the Russian permanent representative to NATO, said the matter refers to vehicles for transporting civilians only, Interfax news agency reported, citing remarks he made on Echo Moskvy radio. ""This has been made so that they could freely move even if militants using improvised explosive devices step up their activities,"" Rogozin said. ""We have not given and will not give our consent to transportation of military cargo by rail through Russian territory.""","The Afghan and Russian foreign ministers are meeting in Moscow .

"(CNN)The Nazis did all they could to make their Jewish captives faceless, dressing them in uniforms and tattooing them with numbers that would become their new identities. In the midst of that horror -- indeed, in perhaps the most horrific place a Jew could land at the time -- prisoners sought to take their images back and made sure that art was still present. Franciszek Jaźwiecki, a Polish artist and political prisoner at Auschwitz, made portraits of fellow prisoners. Though the portraits portrayed prisoners of various nationalities and ages, they shared the same haunting quality, according to Agnieszka Sieradzka, an art historian at the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. ""The most interesting in these portraits are eyes -- a very strange helplessness,"" she says. ""Prisoners created portraits because the desire to have an image was very strong."" Sieradzka believes Jaźwiecki made the portraits because he was aware they would one day become important historical documents. Almost every portrait features the subject's prisoner number, which gives historians a name to attach to the pictures. An earlier version of this story included a reference to ""Polish camps."" It should have said ""Nazi concentration camps in German-occupied Poland."" CNN regrets the error. More than 100 of Jaźwiecki's portraits are housed in the Auschwitz-Birkenau museum, a memorial and museum at the site of the Nazi concentration camps in German-occupied Poland.  The gallery has more than 2,000 pieces of art created inside various Nazi camps or after the war. Through the years, Jaźwiecki is said to have hidden his portraits in his bed or in his clothes. The drawings managed to survive until he was liberated. After his death in 1946, his family donated his portraits to the museum. One of the most important pieces in the museum collection is a sketchbook containing 22 pictures most likely drawn in 1943 by an unknown prisoner at Auschwitz. The sketchbook is the only artwork documenting extermination at Birkenau. The sketches were found in 1947, two years after liberation, near Birkenau's crematoriums. They had been stuffed into a bottle and hidden in the foundations of one of the buildings. ""Some would be surprised that art existed in a place like that, in a place with crematories, but art was especially needed here behind the barbed wire, because the art could save a part of their human dignity,"" says Sieradzka. ""The art was a hope for a better future. The art was escape from the brutal reality of the camp to another, better world."" According to Sieradzka, Nazi SS officers commissioned some of the works. Artistically gifted prisoners made instructional drawings and models for the military. SS soldiers also exploited the prisoners' talents for private purposes, making them create portraits, landscapes, greeting cards and illustrations of German legends. Soldiers sent some of the art to their families or displayed it in the camp's own gallery, the Lagermuseum. That museum also held items taken from those deported to the camp, including antiques, Jewish prayer books and garments. For Sieradzka, the most valuable and important work is the art prisoners made at great risk -- in secret. ""Prisoners couldn't use materials from SS officers for private purposes. It was forbidden, but prisoners many times carried out illegal activity and used these materials for illegal artworks,"" she says, ""These paintings and drawings play a very important educational role as illustrative of what happened at Auschwitz."" Prisoners made art using whatever materials they could find -- scraps of paper, baking paper, the backs of old letters. They made sculptures using bread and toothbrushes, says Sieradzka. ""The art was forbidden in Auschwitz so creating a drawing like that means risking torture, even death, however the art existed here almost from the beginning,"" she says. Jan Komski was a Polish Catholic arrested while crossing the border in attempt to reach the newly formed Polish Army in France. He had escaped Auschwitz once, but was rearrested in Krakow. After he was liberated, he immigrated to the United States, became a U.S. citizen, and worked for the Washington Post newspaper as an illustrator. Before he passed away in 2002, he painted works depicting daily life in the camp -- scenes of barbarity at the hands of the SS and humanity and compassion between fellow prisoners. ""Thanks to these artworks, we could also see Auschwitz and the camp in the eyes of prisoners. And this is very unique because we haven't photos depicting everyday life of prisoners in the camp,"" says Sieradzka. Through these works, she says, we can see the truth about Auschwitz.","Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum has works of art created in concentration camps .
Prisoners would create art in secret and hide it .
Through these works, we can see the truth about Auschwitz, historian says ."
"One member of the esteemed group feels like a ""proverbial potted plant,"" while another resents sitting there ""looking stupid."" Their chief ponders the pageantry and politics of it all and wonders why they bother to go. For members of the Supreme Court, enduring the State of the Union address is a civic exercise in poker-faced discretion. As recent history has shown, that is not always easy. Tuesday's speech in the House chamber by President Barack Obama will be watched closely not only for what is said about his second-term agenda, but also for who will be there in person to hear it. Court members are not required by law to be there, but custom has dictated their appearance in their robes, mostly for show. Talk Back: Should President Obama use his bully pulpit more? They are low-key part of the pageantry and are compelled to sit politely and stoically amid the often high-spirited partisan rhetoric and response of the event. There is no word yet from the high court about who appear. Invitations are sent to each chamber and the justices have individual discretion whether to attend. Usually one or more do. Anthony Kennedy attends but Stephen Breyer is the one justice who might be called a regular. ""People attend if they wish to attend. I do wish to attend, so I go,"" Breyer told CNN in 2005. Government sources say Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who joined the bench in 2009, is expected to be there. So, too, Justice Elena Kagan. Obama nominated both to the court. Rand Paul to deliver tea party response to Obama, GOP . The political embers were stoked three years ago when Obama went after high court conservatives during the speech. He singled out the majority ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, issued a week earlier, which removed legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums on federal elections. ""With all due deference to the separation of powers,"" Obama said, ""the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections."" Sitting just feet away in the audience, Samuel Alito shook his head and mouthed words interpreted as ""not true,"" referring to the line about ""foreign corporations,"" court sources later confirmed. Alito's five fellow justices with him that night showed no emotion. Chief Justice John Roberts labeled the political atmosphere at the 2010 address ""very troubling"" and said partisan rhetoric and gestures aimed at the court left him questioning whether his colleagues should attend. ""It does cause me to think whether or not it makes sense for us to be there"" Roberts said weeks after the controversy. ""To the extent the State of the Union has degenerated into a political pep rally, I'm not sure why we're there."" Rubio to deliver GOP State of the Union response . Regardless, Roberts has never missed a State of the Union as chief justice and is expected to be there next week. His predecessor, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, rarely appeared in person. On one occasion, he considered a painting class more preferable. Some current justices have been no shows regularly or at times. Alito had been a regular, but he told an audience after the 2010 event that he felt ""like the proverbial potted plant"" and would not be attending in the near future. Justice Clarence Thomas called it ""very uncomfortable for a judge to sit there."" He went to Obama's first in 2009, but has not been back since. ""There's a lot that you don't hear on TV,"" he said recently. ""The cat-calls, the whooping, hollering, and under-the breath comments."" Another more vocal no-go is Justice Antonin Scalia, who has compared the televised State of the Union to ""cheerleading sessions."" ""You just sit there, looking stupid,"" he said, calling the event and the spasms of partisan applause a spectacle. ""I resent being called upon to give it dignity."" He last attended in 1997.

"Two men, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, were found guilty Thursday of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby near a military barracks in southeast London in May. Their slaying of Rigby, whom they mowed down and hacked to death in the full view of horrified onlookers in the capital's Woolwich neighborhood, shocked the nation. Cellphone footage replayed in court at the trial showed Adebolajo, still clutching a meat cleaver in his bloody hands, ranting that the killing was ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" for British soldiers killing Muslims overseas. The two were found not guilty of attempted murder of a police officer, in a verdict that took about 90 minutes to come at the Old Bailey court in London. Adebolajo, 29, and Adebowale, 22, had pleaded not guilty to both charges. The two men are expected to be sentenced in January. Adebolajo used the opportunity of a not guilty plea to defend himself in court and declare himself a warrior for Allah. He saw himself as much of a soldier as Rigby, who had previously served in Afghanistan, and said he saw al Qaeda as his ""brothers in Islam."" As he was led out of court after the verdict, Adebolajo faced the media and kissed the Quran he carried. Rigby's family and widow, who were in court to hear much of the harrowing evidence, cried after the verdicts were read. In a statement outside the court, read by Detective Inspector Pete Sparks, the soldier's family gave their thanks for the ""overwhelming support"" they'd received and said they were proud of how Rigby had served his country. ""This is the toughest time of our lives. No one should have to go through what we've been through as a family. We are satisfied that justice has been done but unfortunately no amount of justice will bring Lee back,"" it said. ""These people have taken him away from us forever but his memory lives on in all of us and we will never forget him."" The family, asking to be left alone to grieve in private, said they would now focus on the future of Rigby's young son, Jack. Domestic terrorism threat . The brutal attack, recorded on closed-circuit TV and by bystanders, brought the consequences of British support for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after September 11, 2001, to London's suburbs. Like attacks on U.S. soldiers by Islamist extremists on American soil, the attack on Rigby caused political concern about the implications of domestic terrorism in a country that has fought al Qaeda and Islamic terrorism and also has a significant Muslim population. However, although tensions were heightened in some areas after the attack, determined efforts by community leaders helped to prevent them from escalating. ""This horrific attack and murder, which took place in broad daylight on the streets of London, shocked the whole country,"" said Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick, of London's Metropolitan Police, following the verdict. ""It was intended to divide our communities. It has had largely the opposite effect, and in fact brought people together."" Dick said the force supported the court's decision to find the two men not guilty of the attempted murder of a police officer. ""But I would also like to pay tribute to those firearms officers who were faced with a terrifying situation and displayed extreme courage and professionalism,"" she said. The prosecution had argued that when they ran toward the police vehicle that responded after Rigby's murder -- with Adebolajo holding a knife and Adebowale a gun -- they intended to kill a police officer. However, the defense argued that the two men wanted to be killed by police. The gun was not loaded. Sue Hemming, head of the Crown Prosecution Service's counterterrorism branch, said it would ask for the court to ""find that this murder was motivated by terrorism when the defendants come to be sentenced, so that all options under counterterrorism legislation are available to the judge."" She added, ""As a soldier, this young father had dedicated his life to keeping people safe, including from the threat of terrorism. That dedication to his country cost him his life, and was in stark contrast to the appalling conduct and extremist views of the men who murdered him."" Home Secretary Theresa May said the ""sickening and barbaric murder"" of Rigby had ""united the entire nation in condemnation."" ""Violence and extremism of any kind have absolutely no place in our society and cannot be justified,"" she said. Protesters who gathered outside the Old Bailey criminal court Thursday demanded capital punishment for the two defendants. Britain does not have the death penalty. They 'seemed very proud' Summing up the case Thursday morning, Judge Nigel Sweeney reminded jurors of what happened in the 13 minutes between Lee Rigby's body being dragged into the middle of a road near the Woolwich barracks and the arrival of police. The judge quoted from statements made by witnesses who watched as the two men lingered at the scene. One described the defendants as ""posing"" and said they ""seemed very proud of what they had in their hands."" Another said: ""They looked pleased with what they had done."" Other statements quoted by the judge recounted how Adebolajo spoke to bystanders, telling them ""women and children are safe but keep back when the police and soldiers get here."" They recalled him talking about ""Muslim lands."" The judge also referred to the statements made by police who shot and disabled the defendants when they arrived at the scene. One described how a female officer who was driving the police vehicle feared she was going to die when Adebolajo ran at the car and then again when Adebowale aimed a gun at her. The judge also cited details of Adebolajo's police interview and witness testimony, including that he loved al Qaeda, and that he had tried to cut off Rigby's head because it was the proper method under Allah. 'Moral conviction' In his closing argument Wednesday, lawyer David Gottlieb described Adebolajo as intelligent, totally sincere in his beliefs and as someone who has shown ""absolute honesty and moral conviction."" Adebolajo had told the court he killed the soldier because he was fighting a war. While Adebolajo took to the stand earlier this month, Adebowale did not give evidence at the trial. Adebowale's lawyer, Abbas Lakha asked jurors to set aside their prejudice and emotion in the case. He echoed Adebolajo's testimony regarding their intent. When he was asked earlier this month what his defense to the charge of murder was, Adebolajo said: ""I am a soldier. I am a soldier of Allah."" Both defense lawyers argued that was not the same as intent to murder. But the judge told the jury that the defense argument that the killing of Rigby was an act of war or of retaliation did not apply in this case.","Relatives say Lee Rigby has been taken away from them, but his memory lives on .

"ISIS militants have brought their hardline version of Islam to wide areas of Syria and Iraq, imposing brutal laws and killing people who they deem ""unbelievers."" Their bloodthirsty advances have sent hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming across the borders into neighboring countries, like Turkey, increasing the risks of instability there. But the recent expansion of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS into Syria, as well as a call by a leader of the extremist group for attacks against Western citizens, has raised questions about how far the militants' reach extends beyond the Middle East. With anti-terrorist raids in Australia, the beheading of a French citizen in Algeria and reports of ISIS sympathizers in Indonesia, here's a look at the countries that could be affected. The United States . No sign of attacks being planned . U.S. officials have repeatedly said that they have no information to suggest that ISIS is planning an attack on the U.S. homeland at the moment. But the group recently called on devotees around the world to carry out attacks against people in the United States and other Western countries. After the U.S. and Arab partners began airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria this week, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a bulletin warning law enforcement agencies to be on heightened alert for ""lone-wolf"" terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, a U.S. law enforcement official told CNN. Officials said that law enforcement agencies receive similar bulletins on a fairly regular basis as a precaution. 'Al Qaeda's playbook' Security analysts say the calls for lone-wolf attacks in the United States are nothing new. ""It's taking a page out of al Qaeda's playbook,"" said Robert McFadden, a senior vice president at the Soufan Group, a security consultancy. The United States has in recent years experienced homegrown attacks that were apparently motivated by extremist Islamic views, including the Boston Marathon bombings and the Fort Hood shootings. But a number of attacks in the U.S. in recent decades were committed by lone wolves -- people with no known link to any terrorist organization -- such as Timothy McVeigh, who bombed the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, or Joseph Andrew Stack, who flew a small plane into an Austin, Texas office building that housed IRS offices in 2010. Guarding against individuals acting on their own is extremely difficult, experts say, as there are no orders coming down through organizations. ""Almost all the time it's not there,"" McFadden told CNN. ""So that ingredient makes it so much more tough to combat these kind of things and root that out."" Other group targeted . U.S. authorities are also trying to monitor the more than 100 American citizens who have traveled to Syria to fight for armed groups there, including ISIS. The Americans who have come to harm at the hands of ISIS are James Foley and Steven Sotloff, journalists who were abducted in Syria and beheaded by the militant group in recent weeks. While U.S. officials say they have no knowledge of any planned attacks by ISIS in the United States, they have suggested that Khorasan, a separate terrorist group that was also hit in the airstrikes on Syria, was actively plotting against U.S. and other Western targets. The Philippines . The Philippine Islamist militant group Abu Sayyaf has tweeted what it calls a warning letter to the governments of Germany and the Philippines, threatening to behead one of two German hostages. The group wants a ransom and demands that Germany stop supporting the U.S.-led offensive against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. ""Pay a 250 million pesos ransom ($5.6 million) to free the hostages and meet the second condition,"" the letter says. The second condition: ""The German government needs to stop supporting the U.S. in the killing of our Muslim brothers in Iraq and Syria, especially (ISIS) militants."" ""We have warned you. Delay: 15 Days,"" the groups says in Tagalog, the language spoken by some Filipinos. The group sets an October 10 deadline. It also posted a photo of the hostage. A spokeswoman for the German Foreign Ministry told CNN, ""The German government has set up a crisis group in the Foreign Ministry to deal with this situation."" She declined to be identified because of ministry regulations and would not give any further information. Australia . Anti-terrorism raids . Earlier this month, Australian police carried out large-scale raids after investigations suggested suspects were planning ""a random attack on individuals."" Authorities say they have foiled plans to kidnap a member of the public, behead the victim and drape the body in an ISIS flag. One man arrested in the raids was formally charged with conspiracy to commit terrorism. Prime Minister Tony Abbott suggested that ""quite direct exhortations"" were coming from an Australian citizen overseas who has a ""quite senior"" role in ISIS. Days earlier, Australia had raised its terror threat level from ""medium"" to ""high."" On Tuesday, Australian police shot dead an 18-year-old terrorism suspect who had stabbed two police officers at an arranged meeting. The teenager had raised concerns after being seen at a shopping mall in recent days with what appeared to be an ISIS flag, police said. New law brought in . Australian lawmakers voted Wednesday to introduce tough new laws that would make it a criminal offense to travel to places where terrorist groups are active. Civil liberty advocates have criticized the speed at which the new legislation has been brought in, calling for the Australian public and members of Parliament to be given more time to have their say on the legislation. Australia supports the U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes against ISIS. It has sent warplanes and military personnel to the region. France . Hostage beheaded in Algeria . ISIS' recent call for attacks against Western citizens singled out what it called ""the spiteful and filthy French"" for punishment. French planes have taken part in airstrikes against ISIS positions in Iraq, but Paris says its forces won't be involved in bombing raids on Syria. A video posted online Wednesday showed the beheading of Herve Gourdel, a French citizen who was kidnapped in Algeria over the weekend. The video shows armed men who claim to belong to Islamist militant group Jund al-Khilafa -- or Soldiers of the Caliphate -- in Algeria. They pledge allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. French President Francois Hollande said the attack won't affect France's role in the fight against terrorism. ""France will never give in to blackmail, to pressure, to barbaric acts. Quite to the contrary, France knows what is expected,"" he said. Concerns about foreign fighters . Mehdi Nemmouche, the French citizen accused of the deadly shooting at Belgium's Jewish Museum in May, recently spent a year in Syria and is a radicalized Islamist, according to French officials. Prosecutors say that when police arrested Nemmouche in France, they also seized a Kalashnikov rifle wrapped in a flag bearing the ISIS insignia. U.S. intelligence officials estimate that more than 2,000 Europeans have flocked Syria to fight with extremist groups there. They say it's unclear precisely how many of them have joined ISIS. The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday passed a resolution aimed at tackling the threat posed by foreign fighters who seek to join ISIS and other terrorist organizations. United Kingdom . ISIS captives . British Prime Minister David Cameron has said he's recalling Parliament on Friday to seek approval for the United Kingdom to take part in the airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq. ""The U.N. Security Council has now received a clear request from the Iraqi government to support it in its military action against ISIL,"" Cameron said Wednesday from U.N. headquarters in New York, using another term for ISIS. ""So it is right that Britain should move to a new phase of action."" ISIS has already beheaded one of the British hostages it's holding, aid worker David Haines. It has also threatened the life of another, altruistic taxi driver Alan Henning, and used a third, John Cantlie, to deliver the group's message in videos. Threat level 'severe' British authorities announced in late August that they had raised the threat level from international terrorism from ""substantial"" to ""severe."" That means that officials judge that a terrorist attack is highly likely but there is no intelligence suggesting that one is imminent. ""The increase in the threat level is related to developments in Syria and Iraq where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the West,"" Home Secretary Theresa May said at the time. She made no mention of ISIS in the statement. There are also concerns in Britain about the possibility of the return of radicalized citizens who have traveled to Syria to fight, accentuated by the apparent London accent of the executioner in the videotaped executions of Foley, Sotloff and Haines. British Muslim leaders have repeatedly condemned the actions of ISIS. ""These extremists in Iraq and Syria claim to be acting in the name of Islam. But there is nothing in our faith that condones such behavior,"" Shuja Shafi, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said after the killing of Haines. Indonesia . Report sees risk of influence . Analysts say ISIS' high-profile extremism has gained it a small following in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation. The support in Indonesia increases the risk of violence there, potentially directed at foreigners, according to the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict, which is based in Jakarta. ""The overall capacity of Indonesian extremists remains low, but their commitment to ISIS could prove deadly,"" said Sidney Jones, director of the institute. The danger is that Indonesians fighting in Syria and Iraq will return home with ""the training, combat experience, and leadership potential now lacking in Indonesia's extremist community,"" the institute said in a report on ISIS in Indonesia. But the report said that many Muslims in Indonesia have strongly rejected ISIS' actions. ""ISIS has triggered a bigger backlash than ever seen before in the Indonesian Muslim community, suggesting that support will stay limited to a fringe of the radical fringe,"" it said. President calls for broad approach . Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Tuesday called for a comprehensive approach to tackling the ISIS threat, the national news agency Antara reported. ""This is not only the responsibility of the military forces but also the police, diplomats, religious figures and civilians,"" Yudhoyono said in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point. ""Indonesia, for instance, has conducted deradicalization programs by engaging religious figures to fight extremism."" But the report from the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict warned that Indonesian authorities still have a lot of work to do. ""It is cause for concern that inmates of high security prisons continue to be among the most active propagators of ISIS views and teachings,"" the report said. ""Indonesian prison management has improved in recent years, but there is a long way to go.""","American officials say there is no sign that ISIS is planning an attack on the U.S. homeland .

"President Barack Obama on Sunday signaled for the first time that he is likely to dispatch U.S. military resources to help fight the serious outbreak of Ebola in several countries in West Africa. ""We have to make this a national security priority. We have to mobilize the international community, get resources in there,"" the President said to Chuck Todd on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""We're going to have to get U.S. military assets just to set up, for example, isolation units and equipment there, to provide security for public health workers surging from around the world."" Obama's comments come after sharp criticism from Dr. Joanne Liu, president of Doctors Without Borders, last week. ""States with the required capacity have a political and humanitarian responsibility to come forward and offer a desperately needed, concrete response to the disaster unfolding in front of the world's eyes ... rather than limit their response to the potential arrival of an infected patient in their countries,"" Liu said. Obama cautioned that inaction could have dire consequences. ""If we don't make that effort now, and this spreads not just through Africa but other parts of the world, there's the prospect then that the virus mutates. It becomes more easily transmittable. And then it could be a serious danger to the United States,"" Obama said. American Ebola survivor Dr. Keith Brantly pleaded for help from the international community in a recent op-ed for Time. ""The national governments of West Africa are overwhelmed,"" Brantly said. ""This is a global problem, and it requires the action of national governments around the world."" Obama echoed Brantly's sentiments, arguing that U.S. leadership is necessary for a health crisis of this magnitude. ""When I go before Congress, and I say, 'Let's give some public health aid to countries like Liberia, so that they can set up hospitals and nurses and vaccinations, et cetera,' you know, sometimes, you know, the American public says, 'Why are we wasting money on them?' "" Obama said, explaining, ""When we make those short-term investments now, it really pays a lot of dividends in the future."" The Ebola outbreak has been centered in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with a handful of cases in Nigeria.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- A funeral will be held Thursday for international fashion icon Yves Saint Laurent, who died Sunday night at his home in Paris, his longtime friend and business associate Pierre Berge told CNN Monday. Legendary fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent died Sunday, a spokesman has said. Saint Laurent, 71, was the last of an era of fashion designers that included Coco Chanel and Christian Dior, for whom Saint Laurent worked until Dior's death in 1957. Berge, chief executive of the fashion house, told France Info Radio that Saint Laurent died at 11 p.m. (5 p.m. ET). ""There are not that many people in the pantheon of fashion,"" Berge told the station. ""There will be two who will undeniably remain -- one who symbolized the first part of the 20th century, and that's Chanel, and the other one who will symbolize the second part of the 20th century, and that's Yves Saint Laurent."" Saint Laurent's became synonymous with the glamour of the Paris catwalk and the elegance of haute couture. He took Paris by storm in the 1960s and 1970s with his masculine, yet elegant, trouser suits for women. He also popularized tight pants, the trapeze dress, smocks, thigh-high boots and tuxedo jackets. Saint Laurent often used ethnic themes in his designs, as well as bright colors contrasted with black. His jackets, ""le Smoking"" in French, featured for the first time on the catwalk see-through shirts that shocked and delighted the public.  Watch how St. Laurent was considered a French national hero » . In a 2002 interview with CNN, London-based fashion designer Ben de Lisi called Saint Laurent an inspiration for a whole new generation of designers. ""Way back in the '60s, he was doing, for couture, crocodile biker jackets based on Marlon Brando. He was doing alligator trousers. And that was just unheard of,"" De Lisi said. Saint Laurent introduced his ""Ligne Trapeze"" after Dior's death, when he became chief designer at Dior. He left Dior in 1961 and opened his own couture house, financed by Berge, in 1962. In 1969, Saint Laurent pioneered designer men's wear, with media stars like Mick Jagger, David Bowie and Andy Warhol in mind. Out went the pinstripes -- in came fashion modern men wanted to wear. Vogue magazine editor Diana Vreeland mounted a retrospective of Saint Laurent's work in 1983 at the Museum of Metropolitan Art in New York, the first time a living fashion designer had been so honored. But after 40 years in the business, Saint Laurent, increasingly dogged by ill health, was slowing down. He retired in 2002. Some critics said his work was becoming repetitious. In 1999, he sold the rights to the YSL brand to Gucci for $70 million, retaining control of Sanofi Beaute. Saint Laurent was born August 1, 1936, in Oran, Algeria. After winning first prize in the International Wool Secretariat contest for his asymetrical cocktail dress in 1954, he went to work for Dior.  See some of Yves Saint Laurent's work » . Berge said the designer was intensely shy. ""Like all creators, he had two faces -- a public face and a private face. The public face, everyone knows about it. And the private face, people know it less,"" Berge told the radio station. ""He was shy, introverted ... had very few friends. He was hiding from the world, and was seeing very few people.""

"Build it and they will come. That appears to have been the strategy for urban development in China over the last decade, during what has arguably been the largest and fastest urbanization of a society in modern history. In Zhengzhou, the capital of central Henan province, this approach has had mixed results. Just a few years back, a new development zone, an adjunct to the main city, was labeled China's largest ghost city -- rows and rows of luxury apartments and office buildings sat empty on vast, deserted boulevards. But now locals here say signs of life have sprung up and the city is growing. On a recent national holiday, visitors flocked to a new park by the river. It was a remarkable green oasis of willow trees, ponds, fountains and man-made marshes surrounded by shining new towers of glass and steel. Amid the greenery, several wedding couples posed in tuxedos and gowns for professional photographs, the brides pampered by make-up artists. Among them were the Zhangs, newly-weds who traveled more than a hundred miles for this photo shoot. Though they clearly appreciated their surroundings, they said they could not afford to live in the sprawling, newly-constructed district of Zhengzhou. The same went for 25-year-old Li Cai Juan and her friends. Several years ago, she had an office job at a construction company that built some of Zhengzhou's rows of towers. Fantasy photos for Chinese weddings . Now a school teacher, Li said, ""The housing prices are too high here,"" in the newly constructed part of Zhengzhou. According to the local statistics bureau, the average income per month in Zhengzhou is roughly $483 while property prices in the new district stand at $1,660 per square meter, and are expected to climb. Amid growing unrest over swollen property markets, Premier Li Keqiang has made affordable property prices a pillar of his leadership. However, tighter controls on property markets, such as limitations on homes per person and higher taxes on transactions, have failed to rein in speculative buyers since they were first implemented in 2010. The following year, as part of its twelfth five-year plan, the government vowed to build 36 million low-income housing units by 2015 in a bid to quell distressed homebuyers. The rush to the cities . Demand for housing has followed the migration of workers from rural areas to cities where work is better paid and easier to find. In early 2012, for the first time in history, figures showed that more than half of the country's population live in urban areas. The pace of urbanization has been staggering and the government is counting on it as a main driver of economic growth for decades to come. ""Currently China's urban population is a little over 700 million people,"" said Tom Miller, author of ""China's Urban Billion."" ""By 2030, we would expect it to be one billion. One in eight people on Earth will live in a Chinese city. So they still need to do a lot more building."" Miller predicts there will always be a huge demand for housing in China. The challenge will be making it affordable for the Chinese people. Zhengzhou's population boom . According to city government statistics, the population in Zhengzhou grew by 30% between 2000 and 2010, and today stands at close to nine million people, roughly the same population as New York City (8.245 million in 2011), London (8.174, 2011) and Bangkok (8.281, 2010). But the city appears to have physically grown even faster. In an area nearly twice the size of San Francisco, entire new districts of towers have sprung where 10 years ago locals say there were empty fields. Armies of construction crews are still hard at work. Dozens of new towers are in various stages of completion, even though real estate companies are still clearly struggling to fill some of the completed buildings. On a street corner, two female university students distributed advertising leaflets to passing drivers and held up a ""buy two floors for the price of one"" deal for a residential housing development called ""Harmony Building."" In the office of another real estate development company, a sales representative told CNN all of the units in neighboring residential towers had been sold. If so, nobody was bothering to maintain the grounds around the apartment buildings where knee-high grass and weeds grew between 30-story towers. Speculators move in . Meanwhile, real estate sales appeared to be moving more briskly at the Zheng Dong Business Center, where visitors were greeted by football tables, plush velvet couches, a piano, wine and hors d'oeuvres arranged around giant illuminated models of an office park. Upon arrival, a sales team escorted CNN into a cinema with 180 degree, IMAX-like screen that played an elaborate computer-illustrated film advertising five-star hotels, gyms, shopping malls, offices and restaurants that would one day populate the new development. It would be another five or six years before this virtual city center would be completed, said a saleswoman named Song Lei. Asked whether or not she expected there to be enough customers to fill the giant office park, Song said, ""Altogether, probably not. ""There are some people buying office buildings for investment and there are others who are using it themselves,"" she explained. Some of China's soaring real estate market appears to be driven by wealthy Chinese who prefer parking their money in property rather than in banks where interest rates remain the same as inflation. In less than one year, property prices in Zhengzhou jumped 14%, while the benchmark interest rate remains at 3%. Two Chinese men who worked as contractors in the construction industry were finalizing a deal on the purchase of two offices in the Zheng Dong Business Center's still unfinished office park. Both men said they owned multiple properties in the area, some of which were vacant. ""He owns 20 apartments here!"" said one of the businessman's employees, laughing. ""Come back after 10 years and have a look and it will be completely different,"" he said, when asked about Zhengzhou's ""ghost town"" tag. The businessman, who asked not to be named, said he earned far better returns in real estate than from banks. Miller said the buy-up of property in China is further encouraged by the fact that unlike many Western countries, there is no annual property tax. ""You pay transaction taxes when you buy a property, but once you've bought it you don't pay anything, which is remarkable,"" he said. Build them and they will come? Compared to China, ""the history of urbanization in the West is different. Things happened at a much slower pace,"" said Behzad Yaghmaian, a political economist and author of ""The Accidental Capitalist -- A People's Story of the New China."" ""China is a huge country with the capacity to supply the world and now its own market. Things are bound to happen faster and with more mistakes."" The jury is still out on whether or not huge urban development projects like the new districts of Zhengzhou will become vibrant city centers. But Miller challenges critics who quickly labeled Zhengzhou a ""ghost city."" He said in the past few years city planners had constructed 14 new university campuses in the city, which he predicted would ensure a quarter of a million new residents. ""China is different because it has this very authoritarian power structure. Power rests in the hands of very few people, and that means that local government officials can take big decisions looking ahead 10, 15 years... and create something for a society that hasn't really arrived yet,"" Miller said. ""It's build them and they will come,"" Miller added, ""and build it and force them to come. But of course there will be some big wasteful developments, white elephants, along the way.""","Zhengzhou is home to what was once called China's largest ghost city .

"(CNN)Serena Williams thumped Dominika Cibulkova 6-2 6-2 Wednesday to make it past the quarterfinals at the Australian Open -- and that spells trouble for her rivals who are still in contention at the season's first major. The world No. 1 has never lost in Melbourne when she's played a semifinal or final -- going 10-0 -- with her record overall in grand slam semifinals and finals an impressive 40-7. Further not since the 2011 U.S. Open has the 33-year-old fallen in a grand slam semifinal or final. Those are indeed ominous numbers for her semifinal opponent and fellow American Madison Keys, who prevented an all-Williams encounter in the last four when she edged Venus Williams 6-3 4-6 6-4. Keys became the third young, surprise semifinalist at the Australian Open in three seasons, joining Eugenie Bouchard and Sloane Stephens. But Serena Williams wasn't looking too far ahead just yet. The 18-time grand slam winner was simply happy to advance to the semifinals, having not done so in Melbourne since capturing the title in 2010. ""It's finally good to get past the quarterfinals or the fourth round,"" she said. ""I forgot what it's like for this place, for Melbourne, to look a little empty. Gosh, it's been so long."" She progressed over 2014 finalist Cibulkova despite continuing to struggle with a sore throat. ""I've been sick the past few days,"" she said. ""It's just getting worse and worse. But hopefully it will start getting better. ""I heard it's a virus going around with a lot of the players. I think I caught it."" The 19-year-old Keys will attempt to go one better than Bouchard and Stephens when she takes on Serena in a maiden semifinal at a major. Against Venus Williams, the powerful Keys wasn't without her own health issues, calling the trainer for a thigh injury in the second set. She'll hope the injury gets better -- and fast -- since Keys won't have a day off prior to the semis. ""It still hurts,"" said Keys. ""Definitely going to be getting some treatment on that."" Keys rallied from a break down in the final set against the seven-time grand slam champion, who was competing in her first major quarterfinal in five years. She was helped by her opponent, who committed 38 unforced errors to go along with only 10 winners. In the third set alone, Venus Williams hit three winners and 13 unforced errors. ""This is her moment today,"" said Venus Williams. ""I think it was pretty rare that I was able to string together three or four points without an error. That was unfortunate for me today. But next time I'll be able to play more solid. ""It's definitely been a great last like four weeks, I think,"" added Williams, who won a warmup event in Auckland. ""A lot of match wins, a lot of momentum, just a lot of great things happening that everybody wants to happen in their career. ""I think a lot of players would have been happy with this tournament. I'm happy with progress. I'm not happy with a loss, I'll tell you that."" The other semifinal is an all-Russian affair -- Maria Sharapova challenges Ekaterina Makarova. Wawrinka betters Nishikori . Defending men's champion Stan Wawrinka continued his fine form, brushing aside Kei Nishikori. When they met at the U.S. Open in the quarterfinals, Nishikori upset Wawrinka in five sets before later making his first grand slam final. But Wednesday's quarterfinal contest wasn't close, with Wawrinka prevailing 6-3 6-4 7-6 (6). Wawrinka rallied from a 5-1 deficit in a fourth-set tiebreak in his previous match against Guillermo Garcia-Lopez -- but almost blew a 6-1 lead in the fourth-set tiebreak versus Nishikori. The Japanese baseliner drew level at 6-6, only to then miss a drop shot into the net when he was controlling the rally. ""That one I was really happy because I was not going to get to that ball,"" Wawrinka told reporters. Wawrinka closed out the match with a big serve. Wawrinka improved to 16-4 in tiebreaks in Melbourne, including 5-0 this year. He'll next battle world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the pair's third meeting in Melbourne in three seasons. The previous two went to five sets. They went five sets at the U.S. Open in 2013, too. ""We had some crazy matches in the grand slams in the past,"" Wawrinka said. Djokovic, in the last match on Rod Laver Arena, had little trouble defeating big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic 7-6 (5) 6-4 6-2. He didn't face a break point. Two-time grand slam winner Andy Murray plays 2010 Wimbledon finalist Tomas Berdych in the first men's semifinal Thursday. Berdych upset Rafael Nadal on Wednesday and has yet to drop a set this fortnight.","Serena Williams crushes Dominika Cibulkova at the Australian Open .

"(CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama was expected to make headlines in Europe with her style and flair as she accompanied her husband to the Group of 20 summit, but it was a simple gesture that has set off a media frenzy. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and first lady Michelle Obama embrace while meeting Wednesday in London.

The British media called it everything from a breach of protocol to an extraordinary show of affection from the queen. The Times of London proclaimed it a ""touching moment,"" and the palace apparently agreed. ""This was a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation between the queen and Michelle Obama,"" a palace spokeswoman said. CNN's Carol Costello talked about the moment Thursday with Charles Mosley, author of ""Blood Royal,"" on CNN's ""American Morning."" CNN: According to our tabloids in the United States, the meeting went really well. What's your take? Mosley: Absolutely. What is astounding is the picture of the queen with her arm around Michelle Obama and Michelle Obama's hand around the queen, too. But the queen made the first move. This is the most astounding thing because the queen is not known for being touchy-feely. Indeed, her son Prince Charles complained on one occasion that he wasn't given enough affection when he was a child. She's obviously a late developer. CNN: What's the big deal [about touching the queen]? Mosley: The big deal is that the queen is normally a sacred person. In monarchies, there's a sacredness that surrounds the sovereign, which is perhaps not known in republics, at least not all the time in the way that it is in a monarchy. She's been on the throne a very, very long time, and she is herself a very dignified person, all the more so because of her relatively short stature. Watch to see if ""hugging"" the queen broke protocol » . One of the things one saw yesterday was the way [President] Obama and Michelle towered over the queen and indeed Prince Philip. CNN: By the queen putting her hand on the small of Michelle Obama's back, does that signal friendship? The queen said something to Michelle Obama toward the end of the meeting about keeping in touch. Mosley: Certainly, keeping in touch is meant quite literally. Yes, it's a very significant gesture; she's not known for this kind of thing. amFIX: Your thoughts on Michelle Obama and the queen . CNN: Let's talk about the other gesture: the gift of the iPod. Some tabloids are calling it the ""i-Dud"" in the sense that this wasn't a great present to give the queen. What do you think? Mosley: Not a bad one at all. The queen is actually quite technologically advanced. She uses e-mail to a much greater extent than most members of the royal family and particularly much more than her son, who is a bit of a technophobe. CNN: [The queen gave the president a silver-framed photograph of herself and her husband.] Was it a recent picture of the queen and Prince Philip at least? Mosley: That I don't know. If it's the same as she gives everybody, it must be a sort of middle period picture because it would have to cover so many years. On the other hand, it may well be that this gesture of terrific friendship and affection for Michelle Obama was her way of saying, ""Sorry, I should have given you something more personal.""","First lady Michelle Obama and Britain's Queen Elizabeth II briefly embrace .

"(CNN)Most athlete's best days are behind them by the time they reach their 30th birthday, but Ásgeir Sigurgeirsson is hoping that passing that landmark can trigger more success in his shooting career. Having won a string of national titles in recent years, the Icelandic pistol marksman is now looking to transfer the success he's enjoyed at home onto the international stage. Time and statistics are on his side, he thinks. ""I'm 29 years old and the average age of the top 20 shooters in the world is about 34 or 35 so I'm still not at my peak,"" Sigurgeirsson told CNN's Human to Hero series. Raised in Kopavogur, a southern suburb of capital Reykjavik, Sigurgeirsson was encouraged to take up the sport by his father when he was a teenager. ""I was 17 years old when I started shooting. My dad felt like I needed a hobby -- he's a shooter himself -- so he took me to one practice and there was just no turning back from there."" Initially, he would make the trip to the range once a week and it soon became clear that he had a natural flair for the sport. ""I was getting decent results in Iceland. I was shooting better than men who had been shooting for 10 years or so. So then I wanted more and it just escalated very quickly and I don't know, in four years, I think I was one of the best in Iceland."" Now Iceland's undisputed No.1, Sigurgeirsson competes in the 10-meter air pistol and 50-meter free pistol -- two of the 10 shooting events currently on the Olympic program. ""With the air pistol, the pellets are propelled by compressed air. The free pistol is a 0.22 caliber,"" he explains. ""I started with the 10m pistol -- that gives you the best foundation for all shooting events -- and then it just escalated. I got good at the air pistol and the free pistol is very similar and it improves the chances of getting to the Olympics if you shoot in both."" The margins between success and failure are often fine in sport, but in competitive shooting they are perhaps at their finest, with millimeters the difference between joy and heartbreak. In the 10m pistol, the center of the target (which scores a maximum 10 points) is roughly the size of a one-cent coin, says the International Shooting Sports Federation (ISSF), while at 50m the bullseye is 50mm (around two inches) in diameter -- the same size as a small espresso cup. Despite having to hold a job down at a local communications company, Sigurgeirsson manages to train six times a week, cramming in around five hours practice per day, on average. Mental strength . As the Icelander's slight frame testifies, shooting is not so much about physical strength -- although it takes time to perfect holding a one-kilo gun steady, he says --  but mental training is absolutely key. ""It's physically demanding but not as much as most of the sports, but the mental strain is much more. You have to concentrate very deeply and you have to go into yourself somehow. It's difficult to explain. It's basically meditation,"" he says. ""You're not really thinking about the shot, it's just a feel. You're just waiting for the right moment but you never decide to pull the trigger, it just goes and you just instantly know if it's a good shot or not."" Sigurgeirsson is mostly happy honing his skills alone at his local shooting range -- a situation that suits his ""introvert"" character -- but he never passes up the opportunity to train with his peers either in person or online. ""I go to Italy to training camps, so I get to train with the Italian national team and we have Internet competitions like once a week. I shoot against a person in the Italian team and they're very good so it's always very challenging,"" he says. ""I love this constant demand to improve yourself and if something goes wrong, you can only blame yourself. There are no excuses."" Aiming for success . Sigurgeirsson has enjoyed unparalleled national success in recent years winning eight national titles in a row and holds the Icelandic record in both his events. He has also shot his way to three gold medals and a silver at the Games of the Small States of Europe -- a biennial competition where eight of the continents smaller nations (Iceland, Andorra, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Cyprus, Liechtenstein, Malta and Montenegro) compete across 11 sporting disciplines. Iceland is gearing up to host the 16th edition of the games later this year, but medal success on the bigger sporting stages has proved elusive thus far. He competed in the 2012 Olympics in London, becoming Iceland's first ever Olympic pistol shooter, but failed to make the 10m final and finished eighth in the same event at the 2013 European championships. But with time on his side, Sigurgeirsson is quietly confident that he can hit the bullseye in the years ahead. ""My plan for the future is definitely to be one of the best. I know I can do it and I think I will ... I'm pretty sure I will.""","Ásgeir Sigurgeirsson in the No.1 sports shooter in Iceland .

"(CNN)  -- In the world of massive multi-player online role-playing games (MMORPG), ""World of Warcraft"" is the gold standard with more than 12 million subscribers as of October 2010. With their most recent expansion release, it seems Blizzard's hold on the market would grow even tighter. However, another game company is  armoring up and entering the MMORPG arena. And it comes with a dig at the online gaming giant, calling out its fictional home planet in ads: ""We're not in Azeroth anymore."" ""Rift"" (Trion) is set on Telera, a world that apparently is a nexus of sorts for different planes of existence. These other worlds invade Telera through physical rifts and allow monsters to attack important cities and people. As a player, your job is to stop it from happening. Players get to choose from two factions, Guardians and Defiants. Each has their own races and tactics to employ during the game and both can choose from four classes (warrior, mage, rogue, and cleric). The two factions aren't necessarily battling each other, but are trying to show which way is the best to save the world. Skills are built up using ""souls,"" which unlock powers and allow gamers to customize their characters as they match their style of play. A character can have multiple soul systems so they can change their abilities as needed. Executive producer Scott Hartsman said the initial idea was not to create a new MMORPG, but to create a new gaming technology that would allow Trion to build games in different ways. ""There were visions for some slightly less-formed ideas for what the game would eventually be,"" Hartsman said. ""It was all about ... 'Think of all the cool stuff we could build if we had technology that would let us do 500 players in one place, 1,000 players in one place, big events that start up and shut down on their own. A world that is truly alive.' "" Hartsman said the technology had to be created first before they could figure out what to do with it. Trion was looking for something that was social, dynamic and fun that would utilize their design to the fullest. The ability to track online players' locations and keep tabs on their actions led the team to develop a fantasy MMORPG. Trion CEO Lars Butler said choosing the fantasy genre ultimately was an obvious decision. ""Because of the technology (we built), we wanted to take on the most established online gaming category first,"" Butler said. ""We felt we had what it takes to substantially address some of the shortcomings that this genre still has."" Trion servers are broken down by function, unlike other games in which servers are devoted to particular locations in the game. For example, they use a set of servers to handle non-player character functions in the world, a different set of servers to handle encounters with ""bosses,"" and another set that handles functions directly involving the players' characters. Hartsman said by dividing the servers by functions, processes can be started and stopped more quickly and easily, causing less lag and other glitches in gameplay. Getting them to all work together seamlessly was hard. ""Yeah, it was hard, but it was well worth it. We're really just now at the point we're about 25% into all of the things we can do with our technology and we're looking to add more,"" he said. ""What people see in 'Rift' right now is pretty revolutionary as well as a great foundation for us to keep adding more unique types of things to do."" The technology is flexible enough to handle the weight of the world without crashing and still be expandable for additional players or additional game features. ""Even the best fantasy MMORPGs out there are still mostly static. They have very limited social game play,"" Butler said. ""They're getting old."" ""Rift"" launched at the beginning of March after a beta run and a ""Head Start"" run, which allowed gamers who signed up early some extra time in the world before the official launch. After the launch, there were some complaints about server wait-times because Trion underestimated initial demand. They doubled and eventually tripled the number of servers in an effort to get the wait-times down. Trion is also working on migrating players away from overcrowded servers to new servers in an effort to get everyone's wait time to zero. Trion tailored the game's elements and story to make the best use of their new technology. While acknowledging the fantasy gaming genre is a difficult one to stand out in, Hartsman said having the ability to get players gathered together at a moment's notice was one of the advantages of using their technology. And despite the jab at Blizzard in their advertising, Trion believes there is room for two successful MMORPGs. ""Ten years ago, people were comparing everything to 'Everquest.' This year, people are comparing everything to 'World of Warcraft,'"" Hartsman said. He said talk about comparing ""Rift"" with ""WoW"" is more about gamer culture than direct competition. But he said there are differences that make ""Rift"" unique. ""The fact that there is always something interesting going on in the world and the fact that the world itself can be a dangerous place and a place where there is new danger, new adventure ... gives the game a sense of urgency and banding together with other people adds a whole lot of excitement that only 'Rift' is doing,"" he said. ""Rift"" is available only on the PC. It is rated T for Teen due to alcohol references, blood, mild language and violence. There is a 30-day free-play period included in the purchase of the game, but it then requires a monthly subscription for continued play. It is available in English, French and German.","""Rift"" ad takes jab at ""World of Warcraft"": ""We're not in Azeroth anymore""

"Menachem Bodner is a soft-spoken 73-year-old, who thinks carefully before he describes his first memory as a three-year old child. ""I remember my mother. What she was wearing. A green skirt with white flowers and a white blouse,"" he says in Hebrew.  ""On the left, there was a bed and my brother was sleeping. I remember I had a brother."" That memory is crucial. Until a few months ago, Bodner had no evidence his brother even existed. Bodner is a survivor of Auschwitz. He was four-and-a-half when the camp was liberated in January 1945. In the chaos and confusion, he doesn't remember how he came to be separated from his brother, but he sought a way out. ""I was in the camp. A man came in who was looking for his wife and daughter,"" he recalls. ""I stood before him and asked if he would be my father. He picked me up in his hands and took me out of the camp."" His adopted father named him Bodner and took him to Israel where he now lives. Over the years, his father searched for his adopted son's birth family. At first, there were some positive responses, but after a number of false hopes, Bodner gave up the painful process of trying to find his family, and began to wonder if his memories were simply dreams. Then last year, urged by his grandchildren, he tried again, posting the only clues he had on the internet:  A photo of himself, aged five, and another that he believed was a family photo. Genealogist Ayana KimRon responded to his post. She took one look at that family photo and knew it was not his. ""I said that's not your family.  He said, 'Yes, that's me, I'm the baby.' I said, 'No, if that's you where is your brother? Where is the other baby?' I could see he was shocked at that."" Bodner has no memory of how he obtained the photo, only that it was in his pocket the day Auschwitz was liberated. At first, he was crushed. One of the few clues he had was a false start. But KimRon reminded him that he had another lead,  one he would never forget, because it is tattooed on his arm. The blue ink is faded and stretched, but Bodner quietly reads the Auschwitz ID number that will never be erased: A 7733. Now he is looking for A 7734: The number of his identical twin brother. KimRon checked the numbers against official Auschwitz records now archived at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem. She discovered Bodner was born Eli Gottesman, in Ukraine. He had an identical twin named Jeno, who was last seen by Allied doctors in Auschwitz. ""We know that he was declared healthy on February 9, 1945, by medical staff,"" KimRon says. ""That is really the last factual reference that I have."" KimRon also found other, more disturbing records, showing that the twins were subjected to experiments by Josef Mengele, the Nazi doctor dubbed the ""Angel of Death"" for his gruesome experiments on humans, particularly twins. Perhaps thankfully, Bodner has no memory of that. KimRon has not ventured further into the Nazi historical archives in Berlin to find out more about what happened to Bodner in the camp, and he insists he does not want to know -- but he does want to trace his brother. Now, the pair have turned to social media for help, setting up a Facebook page, A 7734, which has been viewed more than a million times. Each time the page is shared, KimRon hopes it brings them one step closer to finding Jeno. Several nurses have contacted her after seeing what might be the matching tattoo. ""It's like a thread,"" KimRon explains. ""There's three types: One that leads to nowhere. One you think will go somewhere, and you reach a deadlock.  And then there's one that takes you to your destination."" Bodner's grandchildren tease him that he has become an internet celebrity, even learning some of the lingo. ""I'm like a virus!"" he tells KimRon, as she explains the meaning of ""going viral."" KimRon has also discovered more surprises about Bodner's family, including the fact that he had a baby brother, Josef, who died in Auschwitz. Bodner's birth father also died there but his mother, Roza Gottesman-Berger, not only survived several Nazi concentration camps, but returned to her home village of Stroino on the Ukraine-Hungary border, hoping to find her children. ""I saw her signature on the document registering her acceptance of war aid, and the hair stood up on the back of my neck,"" KimRon recalls. ""I am not a graphologist, but you could see, or I think anyway, she had character, strength despite all that had happened. And she listed the names of her sons too. It was as if she was saying: 'I am here. I am still here.'"" That document is the last evidence of Ruth Gottesman-Berger. KimRon doesn't know exactly what happened to her, though stories from extended family members and villagers say that shortly after her return, she was rounded up with other returning Jewish refugees and shot dead by Nazi-sympathizers. KimRon says she has no way of confirming that. The thought of his mother returning to their home village in search of her children makes Bodner both sad and proud. ""I am proud of this woman who did not lose hope and continued to look for us,"" he tells CNN. ""It was a difficult journey in terrible conditions. I would not believe someone could survive all that. ""I think I am also a survivor. Maybe it's in the genes. Maybe it's in my brother's genes as well. We just keep going."" Last year, Bodner returned to the village where he was born for a visit. He met neighbours who described his family as happy, his father a well-regarded doctor and his mother a talented seamstress. They told him they remembered the boisterous blonde twins who played near the house. ""I closed a circle,"" he says. ""It was just good to know that what I was dreaming was real and not my imagination."" Bodner knows only too well that even if he finds Jeno, it may be too late. Asked what he would say to his brother, his answer is stoic. ""I'm sorry that I did not start looking for him sooner,"" he says quietly. ""There were so many years that I was afraid of even touching the subject."" The search for Jeno is a source of both joy and pain for Bodner, but he is committed to finishing it. There is one more discovery that has surprised him: His birthday. Until now, he had always celebrated January 27, 1945, the day he left Auschwitz, as his birthday, instead of his real date of birth. So, which day does he choose to celebrate now? ""Both, of course!"" he says with a smile. ""There is a lot to celebrate.""","Menachem Bodner, born Eli Gottesman, survived Auschwitz as a child and was later adopted .

"When religion is used, or misused, as a violent tool against the innocent, then it is the user not the tool that is the source of violence. The mere idea of traumatizing a human soul violates all values on Earth. Whether based on religious texts or human interpretations, no value in the history of mankind justifies any brutal act against any of God's creation. Abducting school girls in Nigeria by the so-called ""Boko Haram"" is an act of torture and terrorism against innocent souls. In Islam, as in other religions, traumatizing children is considered an act of evil. It does not differ from ""Wa'ed"" (Burying girls alive) which is ""Haram"" (Forbidden) in the Quran: ""And when the girl [who was] buried alive is asked, for what sin she was killed?"" (Quran, 81:8 and 81:9). The problem with Boko Haram and their likes is that they go against all human norms. They want to impose their image of the ""Wrathful God"" on the other images of ""Human God"" which is a natural development of the interaction between humanity and the sacred. This ""Human God"" does not fit their frame of authority. The mentality by which they run their lives and approaches toward their surroundings is a mentality of a superior God. This entails a different and old interpretation of God. In Quran, each Sura (Except one) starts with Basmalah. Any action by humans should start by ""Basmalah."" Starting our deeds by ""In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"" is a recognition of the basic human attitudes towards everything in life. Grace and Mercy are the building blocks of life on Earth. The actions of Boko Haram are against Grace and Mercy. In a deeper level of understanding these actions, one must say that these groups subscribe to a distorted image of God and of themselves. ""Domination,"" ""totalitarianism,"" ""the monopoly of truth"" and ""God's representatives on earth"" are all expired concepts which belong to an old era of interactivity between Heaven and Earth. Going back to such era emphasizes that those who subscribe to these concepts are working to activate the images they need to serve their interests. In Islam, worshipping God is connected to peace, whether peace of mind or body. The Quran says: ""Let them worship the Lord of this House (The Kaaba), who has fed them, [saving them] from hunger and made them safe, [saving them] from fear."" (Quran, 106:3 and 106:4) For me, as a Muslim who belongs to a rich culture of Arab, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, terrorizing human souls is an act against God. Abusing the image and the meaning of a merciful ""Allah"" is against Islam, especially when it is used by those who claim that they are related to Islam, one way or another. I am always shocked when simple and basic religious and human principles are given wrong interpretations in order to get some gains of power. The real meaning of power in Islam is mercy and love. In the Hadith, Prophet Mohammed Says: ""All things of a Muslim are inviolable (Haram) for his brother-in-faith: his blood, his property and his honor."" It is very strange in our 21st century, that a mental activity (reading books) can be considered Haram (Forbidden) while traumatizing and terrorizing children and people is not. The challenge for Muslims though, is how to really convince the world that Islam is a loving, peaceful religion; Muslims should revisit the collective identity they are communicating to others. A first step towards this end is to convey these meanings through active expressions of identity. Mere words are not enough. Actions are a must if we want the world to really understand the essence of Islam. I am not saying that Muslims are the only people to blame for this global misunderstanding. But it is their duty to deliver the real message of Islam to world contexts using proper and practical tools. It is also the duty of non-Muslims to understand the overall situation before rushing to judge. Perhaps what helps in this regard is a self-recognition by Muslim authorities that there is an identity crisis that must be addressed. Revisiting the basic approaches towards modern life, by actions not words, constitutes a fundamental step towards achieving this goal.","In Islam, traumatizing children is considered an act of evil, writes Marwan Al Husayni .

"Bettina Rodriguez and her daughter Isabel had planned their cruise for half a year. They would sail on the Carnival Triumph cruise ship and celebrate Isabel's birthday. It was the trip of a lifetime. That is, until they awoke to a fire alarm, smoke in their hallway and then days and days of misery. Human waste was actually piling up in bags just outside their door. ""Just on our deck alone, there were the biohazard bags lined up across the floor,"" Bettina Rodriguez said. ""We're talking about raw sewage at just the end of our deck alone.  It was repulsive."" It was a nightmare, Rodriguez said. Now the nightmare has been made worse, she said, because of company documents that have just come to light. The cruise line's own reports, inspections and maintenance records detail a problem that had been developing on the Triumph more than a year before Rodriguez and her daughter were on board. Exclusive documents obtained by CNN now reveal the fiasco on the Triumph as a disaster waiting to happen. More than 4,000 passengers and crew members were stranded aboard what's now known as the ""poop cruise"" after a fire knocked out the ship's power. The ship drifted four days before it could be towed into Mobile, Alabama -- the whole time without air conditioning, and largely without lights, water, food and working toilets. CNN has learned that the crew of the Triumph set sail in February with only four of six generators fully operational, knowing that the company had an ongoing generator fire hazard in ships across its fleet, including Triumph. Houston attorney Frank Spagnoletti represents the Rodriguez family and several dozen other passengers from the ill-fated Carnival Triumph who have filed suit against Carnival Cruise Lines. ""That ship never should have set sail in February,"" Spagnoletti said. ""It was unseaworthy at the commencement of the voyage. These documents tell you that the company -- and I'm saying to you the corporation back in Miami -- had knowledge of the fact that this vessel had a propensity for fires; that there were things that could have been, should have been, and weren't done in order to make sure that fires didn't take place."" The first trouble with Triumph was in diesel generator No. 6 -- the one that wound up catching fire. Starting more than a year before the infamous cruise, that generator was overdue for maintenance, often not in compliance with the safety laws of the sea, known as SOLAS, according to the ship's engineer. Read the document about the generator (PDF) Over and over again, Carnival's own maintenance reports stated the same thing: Diesel generator No. 6 was overdue for maintenance. The company says the fire that originated with the generator was not connected to the lack of maintenance. But, during that same time period, Carnival learned about another, even more alarming safety problem in the engine room: fuel lines. A dangerous pattern of leaks had emerged on other Carnival cruise ships, according to the company's documents. In fact, Carnival's Costa Allegra caught fire in the Indian Ocean in February 2012 because fuel leaked onto a hot spot and ignited. That fire left the ship without power for three days in tropical heat of nearly 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Read Carnival's advisory notice (PDF) That would be eerily similar to what started the fire on board the Triumph one year later. Carnival says it proactively began investigating after the Costa Allegra fire and found a big problem in a different type of fuel line. There had been nine incidents resulting in fuel leaks associated with flexible fuel lines in just two years. Spate of fires pose problem for cruise industry . On January 2,  Carnival issued a compliance order, giving ships two months to address the problem to ""ensure a suitable spray shield ... is installed"" for all diesel engines using the flexible fuel lines. ""After that internal study, the company came out with a new policy to, again, shield all the flanges and the hoses,"" said Mark Jackson, Carnival Cruise Lines vice president of technical operations. But Carnival did not in fact shield the part of the one hose that wound up causing the tragedy on board the Triumph in February. ""That hose was beneath the deck plates, and it was believed the deck plates would provide that shield,"" Jackson said. ""In this case, it (the fuel leak) found that gap in the hose ... in the bilge plates and caused the fire."" On February 7 -- with a diesel generator still in need of overhaul and fuel line shields on some, but not all, of its flexible hoses -- Triumph set sail from Galveston Texas.  Three days later, off the coast of Mexico, a fire broke out in diesel generator No. 6 when fuel sprayed from a flexible fuel line, even though that fuel line was only six months old. ""We were totally in compliance ... with all the rules and regulations,"" Jackson said. ""We had ... our regulating bodies on board the ship less than two weeks prior that had certified the ship to sail. Obviously, you learn things on a situation, on an incident such as the Triumph."" Those regulating bodies included the U.S. Coast Guard and Lloyd's insurance. While Carnival Cruise Lines insists that what happened on the Triumph was just an accident, the company has dedicated $300 million in a fleet-wide safety upgrade, focusing on detecting and preventing any potential fire hazards in its engine rooms. The company also points out to the passengers suing that the cruise line never promised a safe trip. Carnival's court filing says the ""ticket contract makes absolutely no guarantee for safe passage, a seaworthy vessel, adequate and wholesome food, and sanitary and safe living conditions.""  Since the Triumph fire, Carnival says it has instituted a 110% money-back ""Great Vacation Guarantee"" on its cruises.

"An estimated 6 million Jews died at the hands of the Nazis and their allies during the Holocaust. Hundreds of thousands more suffered, but somehow survived, in concentration camps. And some escaped, savoring freedom they otherwise never would have known. Then there's Ernst Hess, who was a decorated World War I soldier, former judge and, despite being raised a Protestant and marrying someone of that faith, a ""full-blooded Jew"" in the eyes of the Nazi regime. According to a groundbreaking report, Hess was granted a reprieve despite this designation thanks to none other than Adolf Hitler. Susanne Mauss, editor of the Jewish Voice from Germany newspaper, found the August 27, 1940, note from the Gestapo (the infamous Nazi secret police) that saved Hess -- albeit temporarily. The order was revoked the next year, and Hess spent years doing hard labor in Nazi concentration camps and work sites. Still, given Hitler and his colleagues' extreme views and actions on Jews, even the temporary amnesty granted in the letter that Mauss unearthed in a file kept by the Gestapo in Dusseldorf about Hess is extraordinary. Swiss man reintroduces his cousin: Anne Frank . Written by the notorious SS figure Heinrich Himmler, the note calls for saving and protecting Hess ""as per the Fuhrer's wishes,"" referring to Hitler, who had led Germany since 1933. The letter, a copy of which is posted on the Jewish Voice from Germany's website, also states that Hess should not be inconvenienced ""in any way whatsoever."" Hitler and Hess had crossed paths before, serving in the same infantry unit during World War I. In fact, for a short time Hess had been Hitler's commander -- though the Jewish Voice from Germany said Hess, whose now 86-year-old daughter was interviewed for their story, didn't personally know Hitler and their fellow comrades described the future Nazi leader as quiet, with no friends in the regiment. But Hess himself was close to many of his fellow veterans, including Fritz Wiedemann, according to daughter Ursula Hess. And Wiedemann, who became a top aide to Hitler from 1934 to 1939 before becoming Germany's consul in San Francisco through 1941, helped connect Hess to Hans Heinrich Lammers, the head of the Reich Chancellery during Hitler's reign. Hess, who was forced to retire as a judge in 1936 -- the same year he was beaten up by special police in front of his home -- had pleaded for leniency before. According to the Jewish Voice, he had petitioned Hitler to make an exception because his daughter Ursula would be considered a ""first-degree half-breed"" under Nazi doctrine. Highlighting his patriotism and Christian upbringing, Hess wrote, ""For us, it is kind of spiritual death to now be branded as Jews and exposed to general attempt."" That appeal was denied, though the Hess family was able to move to a then German-speaking part of Italy for the next several years. In that time, Hess still got part of his military pension and his passport wasn't stamped with a red J to brand him as Jewish, the Jewish Voice reported. But after a pact with Italy that ceded that area to the Nazi regime and the family's attempts to flee to Switzerland and Brazil failed, they landed back in Germany in 1940. Rareview: finding a place for Yiddish . The reprieve, credited to the fuhrer, came in the summer of that year. But in 1941, Hess submitted the letter of protection, only to have it swiped away. The special order revoked, he landed soon thereafter in a concentration camp, and then began working for a timber processing company helping build barracks for Nazi soldiers. ""The slave workers were forced to live outdoors and were treated terribly, and of course they were watched by members of the SS,"" said Ursula Hess of her father, who besides being a soldier, judge and ""sportsman,"" had once been a concert violinist. ""Had he not been as fit as he was, he would never have survived."" The name Hess is well established in German 20th-century history. A man also named Ernst Hess was one of Germany's ace fighter pilots during World War I, before being killed in action. Rudolf Hess was once Hitler's deputy, before flying to Scotland on an alleged peace mission in 1941 that instead ended with him becoming a prisoner of war. Ernst Hess, though, was a prisoner of a very different sort through the early 1940s when Nazi authorities deemed him ""a Jew like no other."" When the war ended and he gained his freedom, according to the Jewish Voice report, Hess was asked to become a judge yet again. He turned down the offer. A year later, Hess launched a new career and gained new prominence as a railway executive. By then, he'd rejoined his wife and daughter. But not all his family: His sister Berta was killed in 1942 in the Auschwitz concentration camp.","The Jewish Voice from Germany newspaper unearths internal Nazi files on Ernst Hess .

"If Bill Murray doesn't want to star in another ""Ghostbusters"" movie, maybe he could be the casting director. While at the Toronto International Film Festival this week, Murray spoke about the rumored all-female ""Ghostbusters"" movie that studio Sony is said to be considering. (In August, reports indicated the company was toying with the idea of a reboot, and was taking a look at ""Bridesmaids"" director Paul Feig as a potential helmer.) Although Murray has shied away from participating in more ""Ghostbusters"" films, that doesn't mean he's against an all-female installment. ""I'm fine with it; I'd go to that movie,"" Murray told The Toronto Star at TIFF, where his drama/comedy with Melissa McCarthy, ""St. Vincent,"" had a premiere. ""They'd probably have better outfits, too."" Who could be the movie's stars? Murray has some ideas. ""Melissa (McCarthy) would be a spectacular Ghostbuster,"" Murray said, mentioning his latest co-star right off the bat. ""And Kristen Wiig is so funny. God, she's funny!""

"Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, the 32-year-old gunman who attacked the Canadian Parliament and killed a soldier last week, had a familiar profile. It is that of a young man alienated from mainstream society, with few friends, without a steady job, drifting from one place to another -- often with a history of petty crime and drug abuse. Then comes the conversion to or rediscovery of Islam, and the adoption of a jihadist mindset, fed by media and online coverage of the West's involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and by the well-oiled propaganda machine of groups like ISIS. Whether these young men acting alone (and they are almost always men) should be better described as ""lone-wolf"" terrorists or deranged criminals is debatable. ""There is no single, universally accepted definition of terrorism,"" says the FBI. In many cases, their conversion to militant Islam is about seeking identity and purpose, or even a sense of adventure. Few of these men have a deep understanding of Salafism, the deeply conservative brand of Islam that's the philosophical underpinning of groups like al Qaeda, and jihad; their writings are often incoherent.  Frequently they see radical Islam as a form of redemption from past misdeeds, one that also feeds an existing animosity toward authority and a sense of being ""on the outside."" They blame ""kuffar"" (nonbeliever) societies for corrupting them in the first place. Analysis of the backgrounds of dozens of young men who have embraced militant Islam and eventually planned or carried out an act of violence shows that many have had troubled upbringings -- although there is no evidence they are more likely to come from poor than comfortable backgrounds. They get into drugs and petty crime in their late teens or early 20s and often cut contacts with their families. Some fall under the sway of radical preachers; many become radicalized online. Zehaf-Bibeau had several encounters with law enforcement and on at least two occasions was charged with drug-related offenses. The picture emerging from those who knew him is that he was often on the move and given to irrational behavior. His family members said they had not seen him in five years. Zehaf-Bibeau had contact with a militant Islamist in Vancouver, Hasibullah Yusufzai, through social media. But Yusufzai left for Syria early this year, and his influence over Zehaf-Bibeau is unclear. Other lone wolves had troubled backgrounds, too . Days after the Ottawa shootings, another 32-year-old, Zale Thompson, attacked four New York police officers with a hatchet before being shot dead. A loner involuntarily discharged from the U.S. Navy 11 years ago (for issues with drugs, according to the New York police), he was subsequently arrested six times. He converted to Islam two years ago and like many others appears to have been seduced by the online messaging of terrorist groups. Richard Reid, who became known as the ""shoe bomber"" after he tried to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight in 2001, was also a troubled young man -- impressionable, dabbling in minor crime and drugs and ending up in a young offenders' detention center before converting to Islam. Once under the sway of militant imams at London mosques, his views quickly became more militant. The leader of the group that tried to detonate devices in London in 2005, Muktar Said Ibrahim, had moved to the United Kingdom at age 14 from Eritrea. He was in constant trouble at school before being convicted of a series of muggings, and estranged from his family. He went to the same young offenders' center as Reid, where he found Islam. After his release he too was influenced by radical preachers in London (as was another in the group). Zehaf-Bibeau and Reid were converts. Like Ibrahim, Mohammed Ali Baryalei was born a Muslim; he arrived in Australia from Afghanistan as a child in the early 1980s. He suffered at the hands of a violent father and was prone to depression. As a young man Baryalei was a nightclub doorman in Sydney's red-light district and no stranger to drugs and alcohol. But then in 2009 came an epiphany: He rediscovered his religion. Whether he was influenced by others or self-radicalized is unclear, but his path to militancy was rapid and dramatic. Baryalei is now thought to be a leader within the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and has tried to get associates in Australia to carry out attacks, according to the federal police. Abdel-Majad Abdel Bary followed a similar path. A DJ and rapper in London, Abdel Bary had lyrics that suggested redemption from drug use through religion. ""It's hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,"" he wrote. Abdel Bary claimed he was also seared by the memory of his father's arrest on terrorism charges. ""I swear the day they came and took my dad, I could have killed a cop or two,"" he rapped. Like Baryalei, he also joined ISIS, even tweeting a photograph of himself holding the severed head of one of the slain Western hostages. Investigators face challenges in identifying lone wolves . So can more be done to identify individuals who may be drifting toward an act of terror but who have no connection with any group? And what is the smartest combination of greater surveillance and tougher laws on the one hand -- and prevention and community outreach on the other? De-radicalization programs, such as those in the UK and Canada, have recognized the importance of identifying such individuals before they can do harm. The ""Channel"" scheme in the UK includes behavioral therapy, education and jobs training, and drug rehabilitation to help at-risk individuals, and frequently links them with role models. It has taken 4,000 referrals since its inception in 2007. Canada has developed a series describing real stories of radicalization that are used ""to initiate conversations with community groups."" But as Public Safety Canada acknowledges in its latest report ""family members, peers, religious and community figures, teachers and medical and social service providers are crucial partners in recognizing and responding to the subtle indicators of radicalization."" Even so, ""early intervention through a joint community/law enforcement response is no guarantee that a person will not radicalize to violence,"" Public Safety Canada concluded. Analysis of such de-radicalization programs is in its infancy; the so-called lone wolves rarely appear on authorities' radar. ""The problem is the type of people who are ready to engage in these (programs) probably aren't the people that the government is most worried about,"" criminologist Andrew Silke wrote in The Daily Telegraph last month. There is also argument about whether these programs should be aimed at de-radicalizing (changing someone's beliefs) or more limited disengagement (preventing them from carrying out violence.) Zehaf-Bibeau appears to have been enraged by the Canadian and Libyan governments' refusal to grant him a passport. But three years ago, after being charged with robbery, he asked a court to send him to jail for a year to help him kick his addiction to crack cocaine. A psychiatrist said he was fit to face trial, but Zehaf-Bibeau was sentenced to just one day in jail. His addiction, anxiety and extreme religiosity became a toxic combination -- but the only intervention appears to have been the denial of a passport. Prevention and outreach vs. detention, increased surveillance . In some countries community leaders fear the balance is tipping more toward surveillance and tougher laws, to the neglect of prevention programs and community outreach. The Australian Parliament is debating measures this week that would extend preventive detention and allow police to secretly search properties before notifying the target. Kuranda Seyit, director of the Forum on Australia's Islamic Relations, told the Sydney University journal Honi Soit recently: ""The government has not made an effort to understand why young people have these ideas and thoughts. They've created this invisible war and invisible threat that will continue forever."" The British government has abandoned most of the ambitious Prevent program launched in 2005 to ""increase the resilience of communities to violent extremism"" -- the hearts and minds outreach (after groups that were funded ended up being taken over by extremists) and opted for a greater reliance on law enforcement. It is introducing tougher laws to confiscate the passports of those seen as ""would-be"" jihadists as well as to force terror suspects to join a de-radicalization program. James Brandon at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence wrote in War on the Rocks last month that ""the UK has effectively given up trying to stop jihadists from being created. Instead resources are being focused on trying to catch jihadists before they can strike."" To Brandon, ""this is an admission of a grave defeat."" But given resource-stretched governments -- scarred by the unpopularity of controversial outreach programs and struggling to keep tabs on ""extremist travelers"" to Syria and Iraq -- are increasingly reaching for law enforcement tools to prevent terror coming to their cities, tracking the ""lone wolves"" is unlikely to get any easier.","Like many ""lone wolf"" terrorists, Ottawa gunman was alienated drifter who converted to Islam .

"Previously unknown paintings by Henri Matisse, Marc Chagall and Otto Dix are among a treasure trove of art -- much of it believed to have been looted by the Nazis -- found hidden in a Munich apartment. The vast collection, which experts say has ""a value so high it cannot be estimated,"" was recovered in a raid by German tax authorities, in connection with an investigation into tax evasion, in February and March 2012. At a press conference in Germany on Tuesday, experts revealed that more than 1,300 artworks -- many long feared lost or destroyed, and some which had never been recorded -- had been discovered. Among the haul were paintings by Pablo Picasso, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Oskar Kokoschka, Canaletto, Pierre-August Renoir, Franz Marc and Gustav Courbet. ""A total of 121 framed and 1,285 unframed works, among them works by famous artists, were seized,"" prosecutor Reinhard Nemetz announced. ""There were oil paintings, works in india ink, pencil, watercolors, lithographs and prints."" Nemetz said there were ""concrete indications that [some of it] is so-called 'degenerate art' or stolen art."" Art looted by Nazis 'found in German apartment' 'Degenerate art' Thousands of pieces of art condemned as ""degenerate"" by the Nazis were confiscated from galleries and private collectors in the 1930s and 1940s. Other works were stolen from Jewish families or sold for a fraction of their true value as the owners tried to flee the country. ""The German government is supporting the state prosecution in Augsburg by supplying advice from experts in the field of so-called degenerate art and the entire issue of Nazi-looted art,"" government spokesman Steffen Seibert said. ""But we cannot comment any of the issues of the ongoing investigation."" The collection's existence only came to light this past weekend, with an article in the German news magazine Focus, which reported that that the pictures were found when customs police raided the rundown apartment in the Schwabing district of Munich last year. The recovered paintings are said to have been kept in storage in a secure warehouse in the city ever since. The Munich apartment where the artworks were found belongs to Cornelius Gurlitt, 80. Gurlitt's father Hildebrand was an art collector who dealt in works for the Nazis, according to art historians. Hildebrand Gurlitt had claimed the works were destroyed in Allied firebombing near the end of the Second World War. It is not clear how his son came to be in possession of the paintings. The authorities say Cornelius Gurlitt was unknown to them. He was not on any of the tax rolls and not even known by social security. No charges have been filed against Gurlitt, he is not under arrest, and the prosecutor said it is not clear which laws if any had been violated. Art historian Meike Hoffman, who has been cataloging the collection, said it contained important pieces of the highest quality -- some of which were completely unknown. Art labeled 'degenerate' back on display in Germany . Legal claims . ""To stand in front of these works, which have for a long time been thought missing, lost or destroyed and to see them in a relatively good condition -- in part a little dirty, but not damaged -- gives one a somewhat eerie feeling of happiness. ""Many of the works were not known at all, previously, so they will have a big impact on research into the artists concerned, once the investigation is complete and they can be revealed publicly."" The relatives of many Jewish families whose art collections were plundered during the Nazi era are now expected to launch legal action to try to reclaim their property. ""We demand that the paintings be handed back to their original owners,"" said Ruediger Mahlo, representative of the Conference on Jewish Material Claims against Germany. Speaking to CNN before the full extent of the discovery became clear, Julian Radcliffe, chairman of the Art Loss Register, said it was ""very encouraging... but there are tens of thousands of artworks still under dispute, so this is really just a drop in the ocean.""","Unknown works by Matisse and Chagall among haul found in Munich apartment .

"(CNN) -- It's that time of the year when winter sports enthusiasts dust off their skis and snowboards and get ready to hit the slopes in search of perfect powder and fresh adventures. The choice of ski resort is key to that enjoyment and a good place to start might be Solden in Austria where the Alpine Skiing World Cup starts next weekend on the treacherous Rettenbach Glacier. The courses set for the daredevil professionals might prove a little daunting for the average skier -- but help is at hand from Olympic legends who forged their reputation at that highest level, yet still appreciate the needs of the less gifted participant. Step forward Tommy Moe, whose approach may border on the reckless but who seized his moment to win the blue riband event in alpine skiing. Moe's gold in the downhill at the Lillehammer Games of 1994 came as a surprise to almost everyone but himself. He sensed something special would happen. ""I thought today's the day, I will either win or crash,"" he told CNN. ""You have to have that sort of mentality. Looking back I was at the peak of my career."" He went on to win silver in the super-G to complete a triumphant Games. His fellow American Chris Klug is another ski aficionado. Klug was given a precious second chance of life after a liver transplant and grabbed it with both hands to join Moe in Winter Olympic folklore. Klug spent nearly a decade on a transplant waiting list after being diagnosed with a rare condition, but it did not stop him competing in the parallel giant slalom event at the 1998 Nagano Winter Games. Two years later he underwent successful surgery after a perfect donor match was found and within weeks was training again for his demanding sport. ""I was so glad that my lifestyle had not been compromised,"" he told CNN. Far from it. Earning a place in the U.S. team for a ""home"" Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Klug achieved the remarkable feat of winning a bronze medal in the parallel giant slalom event. ""It was the highlight of my life and I certainly received a lot of exposure because of my condition."" To this day, Klug remains the only transplant recipient to win an Olympic medal. He went on to compete in the 2010 Vancouver Games to extend his career at the top to nearly 20 years. ""I'm proud to share my story and let people know what is possible after a transplant,"" said Klug who gives inspirational speeches and runs a foundation? Klug also competed on the professional skiing tour where he raced against Moe, who naturally is full of admiration for his feats. ""Chris is a great guy,"" he said. Given their backgrounds and love of the mountains, it is no surprise that in retirement both remain close to the sport, acting as expert guides to groups and individuals of all standards. Having raced all over the world, both also have a unique insight and a particular view of what constitutes their ideal ski resort. Given their pedigree and knowledge, they were asked to contribute by author Chris Santella to his book, ""Fifty Places to Ski and Snowboard Before You Die."" Santella, who is based in Portland, Oregon, asked experts, both competitive skiers like Moe and Klug and influential figures in the sport, for their choices and the result is an eclectic mix across several continents. Moe spends most of his time at his home in Wyoming with his wife Megan and two daughters, Taylor, who is six, and four-year-old Taryn. He is also an owner of the Tordrillo Mountain resort in the Alaskan wilderness, where he leads skiers of all standards on heli-skiing tours -- the only way to access 1.2 million acres of terrain. By confession, Santella is not an expert skier, but his own choice is Tordrillo after going with Moe on one of his expeditions. ""I looked down where were supposed to go and must admit I had some doubts, but it was brilliant thanks to Tommy,"" he said. Moe was renowned for his all or nothing approach. It was ultimately his undoing after a serious crash in 1995 on the Kvitfjell course he had won gold on the year before had a detrimental effect on his ambitions at the highest level. But skiing with the likes of Klug and other ex-Olympic stars, he extended his career on the U.S. professional circuit. These days, Moe is mostly content to take in the views and pass on his expertise to others. ""I still ski for myself just a little bit, but I've got a lot smarter. I just liking skiing with business friends, or people hire me to ski with them."" His two daughters have also taken to the slopes and although Moe would be delighted if they followed in his illustrious footsteps, he is wary of the dangers. ""It is a tough career and as I know only too well you can get injured,"" he said. Not that his daredevil days are behind him just yet. ""Live life on the edge, or you are taking up too much space,"" remains Moe's mantra at heart. He understands why Santella chose Tordrillo for special mention. ""It's pretty special. Alaska is really vast with so many mountain ranges. Our little area has 1.5 million acres of our own terrain we can access mainly by helicopter. ""It's a wilderness and we can go to untouched mountains with a dream landscape at all times of the year."" And would it be Moe's own top choice? ""It's definitely in my top three along with my own selection of Niseko (which in the southwest of Hokkaido, Japan's second-largest island) and probably Jackson Hole in Wyoming."" For the 42-year-old Klug, who lives in Aspen, Colorado, there is no place like home. ""Maybe I'm biased but not only do we have incredible terrain, but Aspen has a unique history so you can come here to find great skiing and snowboarding as well as big city cultural attractions,"" he told CNN. However, as Santella notes in the foreword to his book, it's an entirely subjective judgment. For some the perfect setting would offer to chance to match legends such as Moe and Klug on the same pistes. ""To push your skills to the limit on dizzying steeps or monstrous moguls,"" he wrote. ""To walk in the turns of some of the sports' most celebrated practitioners ... for others it might be a few gentle runs on the nursery slopes and good 'apres-ski.' "" But he is keen to stress that you don't need to travel to the other side of the planet to experience the sheer joy of snowing or snowboarding. ""A good dump of snow on your modest local hill can make for a great day. Yet a trip to a dream venue can create memories for a lifetime."" For Klug, every day is a great day after facing down a life-threatening condition to inspire others with his feats. ""I stared death in the face for nearly 10 years on a transplant waiting list and went on to win an Olympic medal,"" he says proudly. ""It's about not taking a single turn for granted and enjoy the ride."" Santella hopes his guide will inspire skiers and snowboarders of all standards to take to the slopes, but knows the selection of the top 50 resorts will be open to debate with so many so passionate about the sport.","Ski legends choose their favorite resorts from around the world .

"(CNN)Good news for air travelers passing through Manila:  the city's international airport isn't quite as bad as it used to be. That's the only slightly uplifting word from The Guide to Sleeping in Airports, a travel website that produces an annual survey to identify the world's worst and best aviation terminals. After being crowned worst three years in a row, Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport has this year lost its place at the bottom of the heap to Pakistan's Islamabad Benazir Bhutto International. It's now climbed to the heady position of fourth worst. Despite the website's name, airports weren't just rated according to how easy it is to catch some shuteye. Readers were asked to judge facilities in four categories: comfort, conveniences, cleanliness and customer service. Is Islamabad's Benazir Bhutto International really so bad? Airport officials didn't reply to CNN's requests for a comment, but survey respondents were less than complimentary. ""This airport is [like] a central prison,"" said one who complained of touts and aggressive taxi drivers. The survey ranked Saudi Arabia's busiest airport, Jeddah's King Abdulaziz International as second worst, followed by Nepal's Kathmandu Tribhuvan International. Manila's climb to fourth follows what many respondents said was a ""slight improvement"" created by the recent opening of its Terminal 3. Three European airports frequented by low-cost carriers were next in line. Paris Beauvais-Tille International Airport and ""not-in-Frankfurt"" Frankfurt Hahn International Airport tied for sixth. Bergamo Orio al Serio International Airport near Milan was listed as eighth worst. New York City's LaGuardia International Airport, ranked 10th, was the only U.S. entry to make top 10 list. Airport with a spa . There were no surprises when it came to naming the best airport, with Singapore's Changi International taking the title it's held every year since the survey began 18 years ago.

Offering almost as many cool perks as its Singapore counterpart, South Korean's Seoul Incheon International was named second best.

"Forget about William and Catherine. The real star of this family is Prince George -- as this year's release of the royals' official Christmas photographs proves. The three images, taken outside with the young prince sitting on a flight of stone steps, show the third-in-line to the throne looking relaxed and sporting a quizzical look and a cheeky grin. Over a long-sleeve white shirt, he wears a knitted, navy sweater vest featuring the iconic guardsmen seen outside Buckingham Palace, home to his great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II. The pictures, taken in late November, show Prince George in a courtyard at Kensington Palace, where his parents have their official residence in an apartment recently refurbished at a cost of millions of dollars. George is in shorts, rather than long pants, with knee-high socks and shoes. It's a look some may love and others dismiss as rather twee. One of the reasons William and Catherine released the pictures was in acknowledgment of the fact that their request for Prince George to grow up without intrusion from photography has been, and continues to be, honored, Kensington Palace said. His parents seized the limelight last week on a three-day trip to New York City, where they met with celebrities, business leaders and political leaders, as well as wowing crowds of onlookers. In the course of the whirlwind tour, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, chatted with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton at a Royal Foundation reception and even met Jay Z, Beyonce and King James -- also known as basketball star LeBron James -- at an NBA game between the Brooklyn Nets and James' Cleveland Cavaliers. Young George was left at home on this occasion, having accompanied his parents on a spring trip to Australia and New Zealand. But these cute photos should restore the 17-month-old to center stage. Catherine is due to give birth to the couple's second child in April next year.","Palace releases three images of Prince George ahead of the holiday season .

"Thanks to its large reserves of oil, the small Gulf state of Kuwait has transformed over the decades from a humble pearl-farming backwater into one of the world's richest countries per capita. But too much of a good thing, as many of Kuwait's 2.6 million inhabitants are discovering, can be problematic. In recent years, Kuwaiti waistlines have swollen to make them among the most obese people on the planet. Nearly 70% of Kuwaiti males over 15 are overweight or obese, according to the World Health Organization. For women, the figures are even worse -- slightly over 80%. Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine recently placed Kuwait second only to the United States on a league table ranking countries by the amount of food they consumed per capita to sustain being overweight. The country's weight gain has led to an unprecedented rise in obesity-related health problems, including heart disease and diabetes. It's a phenomenon being reported in other Gulf countries -- several of Kuwait's neighbors also appear in the top 10, with Qatar coming in 4th, the United Arab Emirates 6th, and Bahrain 10th on the table. Many attribute the weight problem to rapid changes in lifestyle propelled by oil revenues that have transformed Kuwait into prosperous modern consumer society. ""I think it started with Kuwait being a rich country,"" said fitness expert Yousef AlQanai, who was overweight himself until getting in shape eight years ago. ""We have a lot of oil, so this transcends to how we live our lifestyles. It made our lives much easier. We don't have to work in order to survive."" Chief among these changes has been the introduction of fast food. American fast food outlets arrived with the U.S. troops during the first Gulf War, becoming a permanent fixture on the country's culinary landscape. Some have tailored their menus to cater to bigger appetites in the region, such as a best-selling Pizza Hut dish that features a cheese pizza with a cheeseburger crust. Rania Al Mutawa, a 36-year-old Kuwaiti woman who is training for a 10-kilometer race being organized alongside Kuwait's first marathon, said the love affair with fast food was leading many in her country to pile on the pounds. Many lacked awareness of the health consequences of eating fast food regularly. ""People in Kuwait consider McDonalds and Burger King as full meal restaurants -- and not junk food,"" she said. ""The average Kuwaiti does not know what goes into that type of food. It's just like a home-cooked meal."" The popularity of fast food over the past decade has been ""unprecedented,"" she said. And for the generation of children growing up eating it regularly, the consequences would be severe. ""(The mentality is) it's OK to bring the kids. It's OK to have it two or three times a week,"" she said. AlQanai agrees. ""Some kids grow up not knowing that this is not good for them."" McDonalds, which opened its first outlet in Kuwait in 1994, now has 65 restaurants across the country. Spokesman Steve Mazeika said McDonald's was ""just one choice in the eating-out market"" and offered ""a wide array of choices for consumers."" ""We trust them to choose menu items that are right for their lifestyles,"" he said. But there are other factors contributing to Kuwait's weight problem. The country's harsh climate -- in which daytime temperatures can reach over 50 C, or 122 F -- makes it difficult to undertake physical activity during the day, encouraging a sedentary lifestyle and car culture. ""It doesn't encourage people to go out and walk or exercise,"" said Bader Al Failakawi, a 37-year-old father who is also training for the race as part of a concerted effort to get in shape. He said Kuwaiti culture also placed strong emphasis on eating at communal gatherings -- with little value placed on moderation. ""If you eat less, it means you didn't like it and whoever invited you is not a good host,"" he said. But while some are embracing a new fitness culture of marathons and gym membership, others are turning to more drastic measures. Stomach stapling procedures are becoming increasingly popular in Kuwait, with enough demand to prompt the country's first conference for medical professionals involved in weight loss surgery last year. According to a report in Businessweek, the number of bariatric surgeons in Kuwait has increased tenfold over the past decade, with at least 5,000 patients receiving the procedure in Kuwait last year -- compared with 3,000 in Canada, which has more than 30 times the population. The report added that the legal barriers to surgery in Kuwait are lower than in the United States. But for AlQanai, the only lasting solution to obesity comes not from the shortcut of surgery, but hard work in the gym. ""Day by day, minute by minute, you have to work on it.

"Musician Stevie Wonder has vowed to stay out of Florida until the state repeals its ""stand your ground"" law. The law allows people to meet ""force with force"" if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. ""I decided today that until the 'stand your ground' law is abolished in Florida, I will never perform there again,"" Wonder told the audience at a concert in Quebec on Sunday night.  ""As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world."" How 'duty to retreat' became 'stand your ground' The 2012 shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman raised awareness and outrage about the law, although Zimmerman's lawyers ultimately waived their client's right to seek pretrial immunity because of the ""stand your ground"" law. Instead, they mounted a self-defense case that resulted in his acquittal on a second-degree murder charge on Saturday. Trayvon Martin shooting: Fast Facts . ""The truth is that for those of you who've lost in the battle for justice, wherever that fits in any part of the world, we can't bring them back,"" Wonder said. ""What we can do is we can let our voices be heard.  And we can vote in our various countries throughout the world for change and equality for everybody. That's what I know we can do."" Florida is one of 22 states that have a version of the law, which permits the use of deadly force anywhere as long as a person is not engaged in an unlawful activity, is being attacked in a place he has a right to be and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else. Holder blasts 'stand your ground' after Zimmerman verdict . Wonder is familiar with performance boycotts.

"The Palestinian negotiating team has resigned and will not participate in peace talks with the Israelis, a spokesman for the Palestinian mission to the United Nations told CNN Wednesday. ""The team resigned due to the Israeli illegal practices, especially settlement activities,"" Rabii Hantouli said in an e-mail. ""There are efforts to convince them to revert."" ""It is time for the international community and the Quartet members to stop treating Israel as a government above the laws of man and hold them accountable,"" Palestinian Chief Negotiator Saeb Erakat told Al Jazeera America. He was referring to the United Nations, Russia, United States and European Union's peace efforts. Settlement building in East Jerusalem and on the West Bank is ""the issue that will make or break the negotiations,"" he said. ""(Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu has a choice: settlements or peace; he can't have both."" Ending the talks would be a blow to efforts by the Obama administration to get long-stalled discussions back on track. But a senior administration official downplayed the news, saying that Erakat had issued that threat in the past, and that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas -- ""the man in charge"" -- has said that he is committed to the U.S.-brokered  Mideast peace negotiations with Israel. ""We've seen Saeb Erakat do this before where he'd threaten to resign because he's not happy with the way talks are going but ... he ends up taking it back and continuing with the negotiations,"" the official told CNN. ""If this ends up being a real resignation this time, which again we don't know, but if it is, we expect the negotiations will continue."" The official added, ""We have to see how it plays out"" but ""no one is really concerned about it at this point."" The negotiators submitted their resignations to Abbas, Hanan Ashrawi told CNN in an interview in Ramallah on the West Bank. ""Reason is that they believe that there is too much pressure coming from the Americans,"" she said. ""The talks can be resumed and successful if the Americans can rectify the flaw of Israeli exceptionalism and impunity by bringing Israel into compliance with international law and cessation of all settlement activity. ""It will be very difficult to find any Palestinian who will be willing to negotiate with such disparity between occupier and the occupied."" The next step, Ashrawi said, would be for the PLO Executive Committee to accept the resignations. Talk about expanding settlements has ""rendered the peace talks irrelevant if not a total mockery,"" she said. The announcement came a day after Israel canceled controversial plans to construct more than 20,000 homes in East Jerusalem and on the West Bank. Construction and Housing Minister Uri Ariel made the decision after Netanyahu asked him to reconsider the long-term building plans. ""This is a meaningless step -- legally and in practice -- and an action that creates an unnecessary confrontation with the international community at a time when we are making an effort to persuade elements in the international community to reach a better deal with Iran,"" Netanyahu's office said in a statement. ""At this time, the attention of the international community must not be diverted from the main effort -- preventing Iran from receiving an agreement that will allow it to continue its military nuclear program."" Lior Amihai of the activist group Peace Now said the Housing Ministry issued 23,786 planning tenders two weeks ago; the tenders are issued to companies to draw plans to be used in possible construction. Lara Friedman, director of policy and government relations at Americans for Peace Now in Washington, said the plans had included construction in areas deep in the West Bank, east of the barrier that separates Israel from the West Bank. Ashrawi said earlier that Netanyahu appeared to be intent on scuttling any hope for a solution in peace talks recently relaunched by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. There are currently more than 300,000 settlers in the West Bank, according to the Israeli Bureau of Statistics, and about 200,000 in East Jerusalem.","""No one is really concerned,"" says a senior U.S. administration official .

"A week ago, President Barack Obama landed in China with a considerable political limp after this month's midterm elections. But as the President left Australia following a G20 Summit in Brisbane, the narrative, at least overseas, spotlighted Obama with more of a spring in his step. ""This was a strong week for American leadership,"" Obama said at a news conference at the conclusion of the summit on Sunday. The headline in the country's ""Daily Mail"" tabloid read ""Wham Bam,"" below a picture of a confident-looking U.S. President. Obama's trip to Asia began with a foreign policy bright spot -- the release of two American prisoners from North Korea. In China, the president unveiled a surprise climate deal with China.  Stopping in Myanmar, Obama pointed to progress in democratic reforms in the Southeast Asian country. Arriving in Australia, there were ample opportunities to take some jabs at Russian President Vladimir Putin. As a result, Obama left for Washington, largely having avoided the mishaps that dogged his recent foreign travels -- save of course the blip of chewing gum in China. The result was a trip more focused on deliverables than distractions. ""If you ask me I'd say that's a pretty good week,"" Obama said Sunday. ""I intend to build on that momentum when I return home tomorrow."" Challenges however weren't far behind Air Force One. Within hours after Obama's departure from Australia, a new foreign policy test had emerged for his administration -- reports that an American aid worker, Peter Kassig, had been beheaded by ISIS. Related: Obama calls hostage's beheading by ISIS 'pure evil' Before leaving Australia, the President offered no apologies for Putin's frosty reception in Brisbane. But he steered clear of the heated rhetoric used by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbot who scoffed that Putin was reliving the glories of the Soviet Union or Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper who ordered the Russian leader to ""get out of Ukraine."" Obama simply described his own interactions with the Russian leader as ""businesslike and blunt."" He indicated he is not considering any moves to ramp up U.S. sanctions on Moscow. ""The sanctions that we have in place are biting plenty good,"" Obama insisted. The Kassig murder is likely to renew questions about the president's approach for dealing with the terror group. At his news conference, the president was asked about statements made at a congressional hearing last week by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Martin Dempsey who held out the possibility he may recommend U.S. ground forces engage in combat in Iraq. ""There are always circumstances in which the United States might need to deploy US ground troops,"" Obama told reporters. The president, who often chastises reporters for engaging in hypotheticals, offered one of his own. ""If we discovered that ISIL had gotten possession of a nuclear weapon and we had to run an operation to get it out of their hands, then yes you can anticipate that not only would Chairman Dempsey recommend me sending US ground troops to get that weapon out of their hands, but I would order it,"" he added. For months, the president has repeatedly ruled out deploying combat troops into the battle against ISIS. ""I will not commit you, and the rest of our Armed Forces, to fighting another ground war in Iraq,"" Obama assured soldiers at MacDill Air Force Base in Florida last September. Much of the president's attention during his trip to Asia was devoted to his renewed ambition to confront the issue of climate change. Earlier in the week in Myanmar, the president brushed off the notion he should work with Republican leaders in Congress for a bipartisan approach to climate. ""I have responsibilities as president not just to current generations but to future generations,"" Obama said. As temperatures in Brisbane soared into the triple digits during the G20 summit, Obama took note of Australia's vast natural resources as he gently poked the country's Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who is a key ally on issues ranging from ISIS to Ukraine but is also a climate change critic. ""The incredible natural glory of the Great Barrier Reef is threatened,"" Obama warned. ""No nation is immune, and every nation has a responsibility to do its part,"" Obama said. After an unexpectedly eventful week overseas, Obama will likely plunge back into a series of showdowns with congressional Republicans, beginning with the fight over the president's upcoming executive action on immigration. Related: Defiant Obama says he won't bend to GOP . Still, the more assertive White House attitude, driven by a President undeterred by his midterm defeat is drawing cheers from Democratic supporters. ""Since the midterms, POTUS has taken the lead on net neutrality, climate change and now immigration. I like THIS Obama. Give em hell,"" liberal talk show host Bill Press tweeted about the president's new unapologetic tone. But Obama joked about his diminished political standing back home, when he was asked at a youth town hall what he would do as president of Myanmar. ""You're always popular in somebody else's country. When you're in your own country, everybody is complaining,"" the President said.","President Barack Obama just wrapped a week-long trip in Australia and Asia .

"(CNN)From Liverpool to Los Angeles -- Steven Gerrard's move to California has been confirmed. The former England captain will play Major League Soccer with LA Galaxy after deciding to bring an end to his 17 years at Anfield. ""I'm very excited to begin the next chapter of my career in the United States with LA Galaxy,"" Gerrard told the American' club's website. ""The Galaxy are the most successful club in Major League Soccer history and I am looking forward to competing for more championships in the years to come. Gerrard, 34, is expected to arrive in LA in July where he will team up with Bruce Arena, the Galaxy coach. The MLS club did not disclose details of how long Gerrard had signed for. ""My discussions with Bruce Arena and Chris Klein were extremely positive and the future of the team is very bright,"" said Gerrard, referring to the Galaxy president. ""I am committed to helping the LA Galaxy compete for trophies and to having an impact in Los Angeles and I will give my all for the club. ""In the meantime, I will continue to give everything for Liverpool for the remainder of this season before joining up with the Galaxy."" Speaking to Liverpool's in-house TV channel  last weekend, the player himself confirmed that the U.S. would be his next destination. ""I can tell the supporters at the moment that it will be America,"" he said. ""But I'm not over the line with any team just yet. I'm close and as soon as I know, I'll make the announcement, I'll do the bits and bobs that I need to do. ""Then we try to go and win a trophy and forget about Steven Gerrard for a bit."" Gerrard says his decision to move to the U.S. came after discussions with Brendan Rodgers, the Liverpool manager, in which he was told that he would no longer be a regular starter. ""There was more than one moment that has made me come to this decision, but I think the key conversation or moment was with the manager when he sat me down not so long ago and said it was time to manage my games for me and for the team,"" Gerrard said. ""I'm bright enough to realize it is the right thing for everyone, but when you've been a starter and a mainstay in the team for such a long time, it was a very difficult conversation to have with the manager. ""I accept it and I'll continue to give everything I've got, whether I'm starting, coming off the bench or whatever, but that was the key conversation that swung me to deciding to come away for a short while. ""I had an idea it was going to come at some time - I'm a human, not a robot. I'm not 24. I wish I was 24, I wish I'd met Brendan when I was 24 because I think I'd be sitting here talking about a lot of titles that we'd won together."" Gerrard, who has scored four goals in his past two games, made his Liverpool debut in November 1998 as a raw teenager. He won 114 international caps for England before retiring after the 2014 World Cup where he captained his country. While he never managed to win the English Premier League trophy, Gerrard did win eight trophies during his time at Anfield. Gerrard won two FA Cups, three League Cups and the UEFA Cup in 2001. But his greatest achievement came in 2005 when he led Liverpool to an unforgettable Champions League triumph against AC Milan in Istanbul. Liverpool, which finished second to Manchester City last season, has struggled this campaign. It lost the services of Luis Suarez, its top scorer, when the Uruguayan opted to join Barcelona. Daniel Sturridge, the England forward, has missed most of the season with injury while players which joined the club in August have struggled to make an impact. Liverpool is currently eighth in the Premier League, 17 points behind leaders Chelsea.","Steven Gerrard to join Los Angeles Galaxy in July .

"""Since I was a child my family has made an almost weekly trip to have lunch in Skaneateles,"" says Rachel Dickinson, based in the nearby New York State town of Ithaca and author of Falconer on the Edge. ""If you're lucky, you can get a table at the Sherwood Inn, where you look out on the small park with the white gazebo that fronts the lake."" As the weather turns crisp and the days gradually shorten, nature takes its cue to bring on the color—and the leaf-peepers come out in force. Like Dickinson, many head to Skaneateles, one of the best towns for experiencing fall colors, according to Travel + Leisure readers who voted in the America's Favorite Towns survey. The top-scoring towns represent the full color spectrum, from the blazing scarlet, orange, and deep purples of New England's hardwoods to the golden carpet of aspens covering the Rocky Mountains. ""Autumn leaves are nature's stained glass,"" says professional photographer Michael Clemmer, whose images have appeared in National Geographic Society publications and calendars around the world. ""They can be beautiful in moody muted light or when brightly lighted from behind."" If you want to photograph autumn in all of its deciduous glory, he cautions: ""Don't shoot in the middle of the day unless it's cloudy because the bright sun washes out color. Morning and evening light are best."" Clemmer's No. 1 rule? ""Don't let taking photos keep you from enjoying the scenery."" Check out these favorite fall-foliage towns, from Colorado to Vermont, and then get out there to see the colors for yourself. 1. Oakland, Maryland . Oakland took top honors as the best town in America for leaf-peeping, thanks primarily to the blazing colors found just nine miles north of town at Swallow Falls State Park. As the Youghiogheny River flows through rock gorges, the oldest stands of eastern hemlock and white pine—more than 360 years old—blanket the area in gold, orange and red. For five days in early October, residents turn out for the annual Autumn Glory Festival, including two parades, concerts and band competitions. Oakland also embraces the Halloween spirit, hosting a hayride along the lakefront that passes scenes of zombies and ghosts. Travel + Leisure: America's best cities for fall travel . 2. Lake Placid, New York . The Adirondack Mountains are famed for their fall colors, and T+L readers gave Lake Placid the silver medal for autumn foliage. Red and silver maples, birch, aspen, oaks and beech trees stretch out along the Olympic Trail scenic byway (which runs through Lake Placid), providing a striking show of color for its 170 miles. Or take the Fall Foliage Train tour on the Adirondack Scenic Railroad. Prime viewing time tends to be in early to mid-October, which conveniently coincides with the Lake Placid Brewfest. 3. Stillwater, Minnesota . When the leaves start showing their colors in Stillwater—on the western banks of the St. Croix River dividing Minnesota and Wisconsin—visitors converge on the town's many Victorian bed-and-breakfast inns. One of the best ways to take in nature's show is by river cruise on a replica of an 1890s paddleboat. Autumn here kicks off with the annual grape stomp competition, with prizes given for best style, and it culminates in the long-running fine-art and music festival. 4. Stowe, Vermont . As the air gets crisp in Stowe, the sugar maples come alive in intense shades of gold, orange and scarlet blanketing the surrounding Green and Worcester mountain ranges. In general, the best time to capture these brilliant hues is the end of September through mid-October; the Trapp Family Lodge (""the family that inspired The Sound of Music"") makes a charming base of operations, especially during the popular Stowe Oktoberfest. Travel + Leisure: America's best fall color drives . 5.Ludlow, Vermont . Before the snow bunnies take over Okemo Mountain and its ski resort, the 3,344-foot peak is one of the loveliest places in the valley for fall colors—with a 360-degree view that includes the Green Mountains to the west and the Okemo Valley region to the east. Just drive to the top, park, and hike the short distance to the fire tower. Other prime viewing spots are along the nearby Scenic Route 100 Byway: the President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site and Coolidge State Park, both affording panoramic, mountaintop views. 6. Portsmouth, New Hampshire . Like so many New England towns, Portsmouth is awash in early American history. At Strawbery Banke Museum—a 10-acre outdoor museum—you can take in the fall color as you roam the waterfront district and its restored homes built in the mid-1600s. By car, watch the foliage as you drive down the 18-mile scenic Coastal Byway. Or leave the driving to the captain on a 2.5-hour inland river cruise highlighting foliage and local lore. 7. Whitefish, Montana . The mountains framing Whitefish—doorway to Glacier National Park in the Flathead Valley—are a dramatic study in contrasts in autumn, when the golden aspen and larch flash against a backdrop of dark evergreens. Kayaking or canoeing on Whitefish Lake, the largest natural freshwater lake in the West, is one of the best ways to catch views of Big Mountain and the forests around it. If you prefer driving, follow Highway 35 along the east side of the lake and return in time to polka the night away at the annual two-weekend Oktoberfest. Travel + Leisure: Best carry-on luggage . 8. Snowmass Village, Colorado . Snowmass Village and nearby Aspen—which bears the name of Colorado's most ubiquitous tree—are visited only briefly by autumn. But catch it while you can because it's one of the best times to explore this area, with seasonably mild days and not-too-cold nights, and the predictable celebrity sightings when the Aspen Film Festival rolls into town. The preferred local ways to experience fall color are biking and hiking, whether it's along the exceptionally beautiful Crater Lake Trail near Maroon Bells or the moderate Smuggler's Loop at Hunter Creek. 9. Lake Geneva, Wisconsin . When Chicago's upper crust started putting up mansions on Lake Geneva in the late 19th century, they enlisted some of the top landscape architects to design grounds and plant trees that would showcase autumn colors for as long as possible, from early September through November. Three-mile-long Snake Road on the north end of the lake is one of the best drives in the fall, or enjoy a fall foliage cruise. Better yet, splurge on a view from a hot air balloon. 10. Glenwood Springs, Colorado . Autumn can start making an appearance as soon as early September in these parts, and leaf-peepers trek to Glenwood Springs in droves to watch summer green change to aspen gold at the confluence of the Colorado and Roaring Fork rivers. Bike or hike along the 44-mile Rio Grande Trail that leads up to Aspen. If you have to pick a drive, choose the one over Independence Pass, where a short hike will bring you to a summit overlooking 18 mountains higher than 14,000 feet. You can even choose to leaf peep by Segway. Back in Glenwood Springs, relax at the world's largest natural hot springs pool.

"In another security lapse at the Brooklyn Bridge, the New York Police Department arrested a man Sunday afternoon after he scaled the historical structure, police said. Security at the bridge was recently heightened after American flags atop the two towers of the bridge were stolen in July and replaced by white flags. The latest security breach occurred Sunday afternoon when a 24-year-old self-described thrill seeker visiting from Russia scaled the bridge and reached the top of one of the towers, where he snapped several photos with his iPhone, a senior law enforcement official said. Yaroslav Kolchin, who was visiting from Moscow, had been staying at a Manhattan hotel when sometime Sunday he decided he wanted to scale the bridge for thrills and take photos, the official said. An NYPD sergeant stationed at the bridge saw someone climb over a security fence and then head toward the top of the span. The sergeant immediately called for additional units, including an NYPD helicopter, to try to get the climber down. Eventually, he came down the bridge on his own without incident, where awaiting officers took him into custody. He faces charges of reckless endangerment, obstructing governmental administration, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. A pair of German artists claimed responsibility for the July stunt on top of the bridge, saying it was nothing more than an ""art project"" meant to deal with ""questions of historical legacy and art in the public sphere.""","Yaroslav Kolchin, who was visiting from Moscow, has been arrested .

"Sorry, dear readers, but the crop circle discovered last week etched in a farmer's barley field in Chualar, California, was not created by aliens. Instead -- surprise! -- it was a stunt intended to attract publicity to the release of a mobile processor used in automobiles, tablets and cell phones made by the computer graphics company NVIDIA, according to its president and CEO, Jen-Hsun Huang. ""It is true.  The NVIDIA marketing team is behind this phenomenon,"" Huang said as he stood in front of a picture of the manicured field. ""What you're looking at here is 310 feet in diameter. It is what people call a crop circle."" Huang made the announcement during a keynote address Sunday night at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. ""It's like, out of this world, it's practically built by aliens,"" Huang said, referring to the new Tegra K1 graphics chip. Elaborate crop circle in California mowed down . Brett Murray, who works as a marketer for the company, told CNN in a telephone interview that the idea emerged during a brainstorming session in early December about how to introduce the new product. They came up with the tag line, ""Impossibly advanced,"" then tried to figure out how to ""get some noise"" around it, he said. From ""impossibly advanced"" to ""aliens"" was not a big leap. ""We eventually said, 'You know, what's graceful and alien? Crop circles.'"" They then set to work, swearing everyone to secrecy, hiring a Hollywood location scout to find ""the perfect field in Northern California,"" and flying in a British group who have made crop circles before. Starting buzz for the creation, the company called anonymous tip lines for news stations in the Bay Area, telling them: ""Something's going on out in Chualar."" A crudely made video also popped up on YouTube purporting to show two men -- in reality, Murray and another NVIDIA employee -- getting out of a car and looking at strange lights coming from the farmer's field and then stumbling toward them. By the morning of December 30, the news trucks were rolling in and, with them, throngs of curious onlookers. The company hired security to keep them from trampling over the farmer's fields. Murray described the crop circle as ""a puzzle out there for the world to solve."" The puzzle included clues to who was behind it -- for example, the number 192 is posted in two ways in the design -- as numbers on a clock and as a Braille representation. That's the number of graphical processing unit cores in the new chip. At least one person appears to have figured it all out. John Van Vliet posted this at 12:16 a.m. Wednesday, January 1, on doubtfulnews.com: ""The crop art really dose (sic) look like a graphics GPU chip if i had to bet ... one of the NEW CPU/GPU combos from AMD or Nvidia or intell."" Murray said he understood why the story attracted so much attention. ""This is like Santa Claus,"" he said. ""People want to believe.""","The crop circle is a publicity stunt .
