"(CNN) -- There are plenty of ways to game the upcoming Supreme Court decision on health care reform, and they've all been said: President Obama loses in court, he wins with his base. Or it's a severe blow, potentially fatal. Or Republicans benefit if they win, because they were ""right"" all along. Or the GOP loses, because it has to figure out what to offer for health care instead. And so it goes. But there's something else going on here, and it's more meaningful than some short-term political skirmishing. This Supreme Court case is the Waterloo for political polarization, because it underscores something we should have known all along: Great changes in national public policy should never be erected on slender partisan majorities. If they are, they will always be suspect. It's a proposition advanced by the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who understood there's little upside to partisan policymaking. After all, he was a member of the 1983 commission that reformed -- and saved -- Social Security for a generation. The program faced collapse; a bipartisan group of heavy-hitters fixed it, together. No one liked all that the rescue plan contained. But the work had to be done and they did it. That kind of work is not something we see a lot of these days: health care reform, arguably the most far-reaching social legislation since Medicare, was passed strictly along party lines. Sure, the White House says -- with some justification -- that Republicans weren't interested in their plan. But would the GOP have bitten on a more scaled-back version? Would some in the GOP have broken ranks over, say, requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions so long as it wouldn't bankrupt them? Sure. But that wasn't to be. The Democrats had a two-house majority, so the stars were aligned. And with recalcitrant Republicans vocal in their opposition, the Democrats, too, became more strident. So reform was an all-Democratic bill, a sure way to be challenged before the high court. And no one looks good: the president, who Monday seemed to be warning the court about ""judicial activism"" in advance of any decision; the court, which about half of the public now believes is political anyway; and Congress, which has an approval rating so low it's hard to even find. That's what happens when Washington's default setting is always along party lines. And it's not going to get any better. As congressional districts are redrawn to benefit partisans, those elected become -- naturally -- more partisan. So there is no political benefit to compromise, and as conservative southern Democrats virtually disappear, there are no natural allies left in the Democratic party for vote-hunting GOPers. The same goes for Democrats in search of moderate Republicans, most of whom are either quitting Congress out of frustration (see: Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine) or are fighting for their political lives (see: Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana). Imagine today's Congress passing, by bipartisan majorities, legislation on two controversial issues: taxes and immigration reform. Impossible, right? Well, it was done in the mid-1980's. The tax measure lowered rates and eliminated some loopholes (many, alas, have crept back into the code, but that's another story.) And the immigration bill legalized certain illegal immigrants while punishing employers for hiring illegal immigrants. (And of course we are back at that issue again). So while the measures were far from permanent or perfect solutions, they were big fixes. Sure, Democrats controlled the House and Republicans maintained control of the Senate and President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, was in his second term, finding a way to cut deals with members of both parties. Oh, and by the way, the chairmen of the tax-writing committee -- a House Democrat and a Senate Republican -- actually worked together to get something through the Congress. Ditto for those writing the immigration legislation. I know. I watched them in action. Believe me, it was nothing like watching the debt-ceiling debacle of last summer. Even when there was one small glimmer of hope that the White House and GOP House Speaker John Boehner might work something out, it disappeared. And almost one year later, each side is trying to get history to blame the other fellow for the failure to strike a deal. It's too bad, really. Because in the end, history will blame both sides -- for looking small when most of the country thinks our problems deserve solutions that are really big.

"(CNN) -- Americans have become used to the fact that most of the jobs created by Apple are in China. We know that Steve Jobs told President Barack Obama that ""those jobs aren't coming back."" Recently, an executive at Apple said that the company has no obligation to solve America's problems by moving some of those jobs back to the United States. As a business, Apple has a right to fear that moving the assembly work from China to the United States will entail raising labor costs so high as to make the company less competitive and profitable. But for it to say that it has no obligation to help solve America's problems is completely unacceptable. Virtually every piece of technology in any Apple product had its origin or was partially developed on the basis of a U.S. government-funded program. In a global world where piracy of products is commonplace, Apple, like other multinationals, has continuously pressed the U.S. government to enforce copyright and patent laws to protect its intellectual property from international theft. Does Apple owe anything to Uncle Sugar? You betchum. Big time. Skeptics are right to point out that moving the factory assembly operations to the United States is a nonstarter as long as we continue to have free trade with China. These kinds of jobs are labor-intensive, and the differential in the cost of labor between America and China is just too large. But this is not where the real value or the good jobs we want for Americans lies. The assembly value in an iPhone is only about $7. The real treasure-trove is in the parts. For example, the displays, the processors, memory chips and other key electronic components comprise nearly half of the value of the iPhone. These components require intensive capital and technology investments, but they do not require a great amount of labor. In other words, they can all be produced in America. Indeed, according to a recent study by Booz and Co., to supply the U.S. market, the most competitive location in which to produce these components is the United States. At the moment, however, Apple is not procuring most of these parts in America. With a few exceptions, the company is getting them from South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, China or Germany. Let's take Gorilla Glass, a product made by Corning Inc. of Corning, New York, that is used as the display for the iPhone and iPad as well as many other smartphones and tablets. Corning can and does make that glass in America. But to gain access to China's market, Corning is pressured by the Chinese government to make Gorilla Glass in China so that it can be used in any Chinese factory that makes a product that needs the glass. Basically, Corning must invest and produce in China, even though, in my estimates, it might be less expensive to make Gorilla Glass in America and export it to China. The same is true for other assembly line parts. So what should Apple do? We know that Samsung, a South Korean supplier, had started to produce a key processor for Apple in Austin, Texas. That's a good first step. Apple should go further by telling other suppliers that it wants more components to be made in America. One advantage for this move is that it can create an environment in which more research and development is possible, which in turn can strengthen overall innovation for Apple. Apple should also move some of its assembly operations to Mexico. Mexican labor isn't as cheap as Chinese labor, but after one adjusts for the differences in the cost of shipping, establishing assembly-line factories in Mexico should be quite acceptable from a financial and quality perspective. By moving more production of advanced components to America and the human labor to Mexico, more jobs will be added to North America and help reduce the U.S.-Mexican trade deficit, which is about $55 billion annually. And by having the assembly work just over the border, Apple can ensure that costs can be kept under control. As Apple is trying to get out of the recent controversy surrounding its suppliers' labor practices in China, where workers put in more than 60 hours a week, the world's most highly valued company would do well to consider how best to spend and invest its $100 billion cash pile. It needs to realize that what is good for Apple can also be good for the American economy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clyde Prestowitz.","Apple says the company has no obligation to help solve America's problems .

"(CNN) -- It all started on my second date with Alex. It was 1997 and on a whim we went into Manhattan to see the ball drop on New Year's Eve in Times Square. The closest we could get was 55th Street and Seventh Avenue. That's pretty far away, but we could still see the glittering ball touching the sky. He was 19, I was 17. For him, I was his childhood dream girl: I'm tall, have curly brown hair and I play cello, so I was the real-life version of Sigourney Weaver's character in ""Ghostbusters"" (his favorite movie). To me, he was smart, doting and hilarious. On what had to be the coldest night in the history of the ball drop, we shivered next to each other waiting patiently, with a few thousand spectators, to get one year closer to the millennium. At midnight, the ball dropped and the crowd erupted. We looked at each other in anticipation and we kissed. Fireworks went off. Literally, behind us in Central Park fireworks set the sky ablaze to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the five boroughs constituting New York City. And when the heck did that saxophone player show up playing ""Auld Lang Syne""? We took this only-in-the-movies moment as a sign from the universe that we were meant to be together. There was one problem: Alex is half-black. I am white, half-Spanish in fact. In the back of my mind, I knew Alex's race would pose a problem for my family. Not to get explicit, but racial epithets were common in my house. My dad emigrated from Spain in the early 1970s and worked in construction. The culture on the job, coupled with his solid self-righteousness and Old World thinking, led to an intense hatred of anything ""different."" The N-word, the C-word, the other C-word, the G-word, the S-word -- they all echoed in my house regularly. My mom, who moved to New York from Iowa, was indifferent on race but wasn't about to challenge my dad's way of thinking. How did I come out of this house without being a racist? That I can't answer. Race wasn't an issue for me. I grew up in Queens and was exposed to all races when I was young. When I met Alex, it sounds corny, but I never saw a color -- I just saw Alex. Fast-forward to senior prom: I decided this would be the time for my parents to meet the guy I'd been dating. I looked stunning in my red-sequined Jessica McClintock ball gown, and Alex was dapper in a tux and top hat. We had already, by that point, said we loved each other and knew this was something special. I thought that introducing him to my parents in a public place where my dad couldn't freak out was the way to go. The conversation in the parking lot at the prom literally went like this: . ""Dad, this is Alex."" Handshake. ""Nice to meet you, Alex."" ""Nice to meet you, sir."" ""OK, have a good time."" Then my dad walked away. Alex and I danced through the night and left the next day for the customary fun weekend to the Jersey Shore with my classmates. I returned home a day later. Saying a nuclear bomb went off in my family would not begin to describe what happened. My dad lost it. He had stewed while I was away, waiting to unleash his fury. I was led to the basement to receive the lecture of my life. No way was his daughter going to date a black man. ""Do you want to be a big mama ... barefoot and pregnant for the rest of your life? Do you want a bunch of black babies?"" he screamed. ""You're going to throw your life away on that n-----?"" Full coverage: ""AC360Â°"": Kids on Race"" Those are just some of the lines I remember. It went on for hours, and he said a lot more, but I had shut my brain off after the first few minutes. In my mind, I was just dating Alex. In my dad's mind, my life was over. The fallout continued for months. My dad refused to talk to me or co-sign my school loan papers for college. I was kicked out of the house on more than one occasion. Alex felt helpless, livid at being judged by a handshake and his skin color, but he knew it didn't have anything to do with him. It was all in my dad's head. From what I'd heard about Alex's parents, it sounded like we were on track to repeat history. Alex's mom, a white woman from Long Island, had a troubled relationship with her own father as a result of her dating Alex's dad, a black man from Georgia. I was grateful that she let me hide out in her apartment and served as my refuge, and she stayed out of the drama. We had to figure this out on our own. All the fighting never changed my feelings for Alex, and I never considered breaking up with him to appease my family. I knew Alex was ""the one,"" and I wasn't about to let my racist father get in the way of my happiness. For the next eight years, I dated Alex in secret. My dad didn't know a thing. It didn't matter since we barely talked. My mom had an inkling, but I didn't tell her much. Alex and I had milestones, we went to friends' weddings, became honorary aunts and uncles. We even moved in together, and for years my parents were none the wiser. By 2006, I was well into my job at CNN. My colleagues knew what was going on and encouraged me to talk to my dad again, this time as a strong adult woman who was succeeding in a career and no longer financially dependent on my parents. They were right. It was eating me up inside that I had to pretend that a huge part of my life didn't exist. I took my parents to lunch, hoping again that there would be safety in a public space. Sometime before the entrÃ©e, I explained that I was still dating the same man who was rejected so ferociously nearly 10 years earlier. I told my dad I understood he was trying to protect his daughter, but he should have trusted me to make the right decision for myself. I said I couldn't pretend I wasn't with Alex, we wanted to get married, and to be a part of my life, they had to accept it. ""Do you love him? And does he love you?"" my dad asked cautiously. ""Yes. He's my soul mate,"" I answered. After eight years of tears and anxiety, my dad conceded. I sometimes wonder why my dad had a change of heart, because all discussion on the matter ended that day. I don't think he had one ""aha"" moment, but maybe it just took years of rolling it over in his head and realizing that his preconceived notions of what would happen to me if I dated Alex were wrong. I was neither a ""big mama"" (what does that even mean?) or barefoot, pregnant or destitute. I was solidly in my adult life and happy in love. Alex and I were married on August 4, 2007. My dad walked me down the aisle . It's been 14 years since the roller coaster started. It almost seems like the lying, the hurt and the drama happened to someone else. Alex is my family, my other half, the love of my life. He's just as much a member of the family as anyone else. Alex visits my parents often, and my dad sometimes calls him just to chat. Sometimes my dad will jokingly refer to him as ""chocolate milk"" or ""Barack Obama,"" maybe as way of relieving some tension around the intense hatred he had once possessed. We even took a family trip to my dad's childhood home in Spain. I think my dad was secretly thrilled to have Alex to share his stories of walking for miles as a 5-year-old to see my grandmother in the hospital, or throwing a cat on a horse's back just to watch both animals squeal. Slowly, my dad shared the family myths and stories with my husband and we grew closer. As we get ready to start our own family, I think about how I will explain this all to my future child (or children -- that's still up for discussion) about what we went through to be together. Cheesy as it sounds, I think I'll tell them that love really conquers all, and time, with a dash of patience, heals many wounds. I'll teach them that change is always possible, even when you think it's not. And I'd emphasize that forgiveness for someone else's misperception doesn't have to come from an apology, but can be a way of allowing yourself to deal with a situation that is out of your control. And I'll make sure not to censor anything, because they deserve to know how we found a way to break through hatred to find acceptance. Join us at Facebook/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- Suppose the Supreme Court does rule that the health care mandate is unconstitutional? What happens then? (I'm not saying that they will, but let's play ""what if?"") The famous individual mandate is just one piece of the new health care law enacted in 2010. Take away the mandate, and here are two principal elements left behind: . -- A huge expansion of the Medicaid program. The majority of those who'd gain health coverage under the new health care law, an estimated 18 million people, would gain it from being enrolled in Medicaid, the health care program for the poor. Even before the new health care law, Medicaid was a huge program, covering one in six Americans. It's on its way to becoming bigger still, whatever happens to the individual mandate. -- Tough new rules on insurance companies. The new health care law forbids insurers to refuse coverage on the basis of ""pre-existing conditions."" All applicants must be accepted, and they must be covered at the same price as the other members of the insured group. Now let's war-game what happens post-mandate. 1. The private insurance market will crash in a spectacular train wreck. Faced with big new costs and deprived of their expected new revenues from the mandate, insurance companies will have to raise prices. Faced with rising prices, employers will cut back coverage. The 2010 law imposes new obligations on employers to provide health insurance but also presents employers with an option to escape those obligations by paying a (comparatively) small fine. As insurance costs surge in a post-mandate world, more employers will take advantage of that option. Their employees will join the new market for individual care, the famous health care ""exchanges."" Minus the mandate, the policies on offer in the exchanges will be unexpectedly expensive. Minus the mandate, many individuals will choose not to buy. The law offers subsidies to buyers who cannot afford the full cost of the new policies. Minus the mandate, those subsidies will cost much more than expected. 2. The Medicaid program will grow. The new health care law dramatically expands eligibility for Medicaid. In a post-mandate world, with employers dropping coverage and the individual market careening into dysfunction, Medicaid will likely grow faster than ever. Costs of the Medicaid program are divided between the federal and state governments. As Medicaid surges, those governments will face an agonizing dilemma: Raise taxes to pay for all those new applicants or reduce coverage, leaving millions of people to clinics and charity. 3. Meanwhile, the Medicare time bomb will continue to tick. The U.S. already has a single-payer health care system. It's called Medicare, and even today, it is one of the largest single-payer systems on Earth, enrolling more than 47 million people. As more and more of the baby boomers turn 65, the program is scheduled to expand rapidly -- to more than 63 million people by 2020 and more than 80 million by 2030. We are headed, it would seem, to a post-mandate future that looks something like this: . Medicare will provide fairly generous government health coverage to about one-quarter of the population. Medicaid will provide much less generous government coverage to one-quarter of the population. The population outside Medicaid and Medicare will subdivide into two main groups: . The affluent and those whose labor is greatly valuable to their employers will be covered by an ever-more-expensive and ever-shrinking private-insurance market. The people who can't pay themselves and whose employers won't pay for them will drop out of the private market, and either look for ways to qualify for Medicaid or wait and pray until they qualify for Medicare. Political pressures will induce politicians to open Medicaid to more and more uninsured people. Fiscal pressures will force politicians to make Medicare less generous and more Medicaid-like. If the Supreme Court rules unconstitutional the plan for universal coverage through private insurance, the U.S. will continue to evolve toward a government-led system -- albeit one much more expensive, and much less satisfactory, than the government systems of other advanced democracies. Perhaps after a decade or two of discontent, somebody else will try another reform. But this time, the reform will proceed as an outright government program. There won't be any choice, if the Supreme Court of 2012 precludes as unconstitutional the private-sector alternative -- meaning that today's would-be champions of the free market will have unwittingly brought about the grandest expansion of government control since the 1930s. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","The U.S. Supreme Court may strike down the mandate to buy health insurance .
David Frum says elimination of mandate would spur more government-funded health care .
Without private insurance, more people will look to get Medicaid coverage, he says .

"(CNN) -- Friday morning, many Americans lined up outside their local convenience stores, hoping to pick the lucky numbers that would win the record-setting $640 million jackpot offered by Mega Millions. The curious thing about this fervor is not that the odds of winning are 1 in 176 million, but rather that in effect, Americans are anxiously lining up to pay a tax, even if it is wrapped in attractive clothing. While no government actually labels its lottery a tax, the games properly fit the definition of one. After lottery winnings are paid out and administrative costs have been covered, the leftover money is transferred into state coffers to pay for state programs. This is a tax. State governments have developed a strong reliance on these lottery ""profits"" over the years. In 2010, states collected an average of $58 per capita in implicit tax revenue from their lottery programs. Delaware, which had the heaviest reliance on lottery revenue, collected a stunning $370 per capita. This increasing reliance on lotteries to fund state governments is troubling, as these taxes disproportionately fall on low-income individuals. A slew of studies in the past two decades has found that low-income people spend a greater portion of their income on lottery tickets than do high-income individuals, meaning lotteries are a regressive way to collect tax revenue. Many have argued that while lotteries are indeed taxes, they are not so bad, because people pay them voluntarily. But people only buy government lottery tickets voluntarily because private lotteries are not allowed to operate. State lotteries only pay out an average of 60% of their gross revenues, a payout vastly inferior to those of slot machines and table games, which offer payouts in many cases above 90%. People only buy state-run lottery tickets because tickets with better odds are choked out of the market. So while the purchase of the ticket itself is voluntary, the portion of that ticket sale that goes to state revenues is not, much in the same way that a sales tax paid on a book is not voluntarily paid. The curious relationship between state-run lotteries and taxes does not end there though. Even when someone wins the lottery, the winnings are subject to special withholding taxes at the state and federal levels. If someone wins the $640 million jackpot, they would be immediately subject to a 25% federal withholding and state withholding rates as high as 12%. Their total income tax burden on the winnings might be more depending on how they invest that income and what credits and deductions they take next April. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Scott Drenkard.","The Mega Millions lottery jackpot is at an estimated $640 million .

"(CNN) -- I've long been haunted by a chilling statistic from an old study: 54% of women 18 to 25 said they would rather be hit by a truck than be fat. When I read it, I was aghast. Who, I wondered, were the women who would choose blood and broken bones over some extra body weight? Turns out they are my friends -- and maybe yours. And, perhaps, a few men (more on that later). ""How fast is the truck going?"" my friend Lisa asked. ""How fat would I have to be?"" ""Does it run over my lower half or upper half?"" Naomi mused. ""Oh, also,"" she said, chewing on a Japanese noodle as we chatted over dinner, ""you might have to get your jaw wired shut and then you'd definitely lose weight."" But women don't need to wade into traffic to suffer for beauty; these horrific would-you-rather games are closer to reality than we might think. Many of us endure pain in the service of beauty every single day. We rip off our hair with hot wax, jam our soft skin into modern-day corsets, and burn our scalps with dyes. We ask doctors to suck out the fat in our thighs, pump Botox into our faces and inflate our breasts with silicon. We smush our feet into unholy angles in skyscraper heels, and as medical professionals have said yet again, those fabulous Louboutins cause everything from muscle strains and ligament tears to stress fractures. Aren't we beyond this? Haven't we come a long way, baby? You would think that the End of Men might also herald the end of the Brazilian. Hardly. According to the American Society for Plastic Surgeons, nearly 15 million cosmetic surgery procedures were done last year, a 5% bump for the industry. Botox and facelifts saw the biggest increases. The founder of Spanx recently became the world's youngest female self-made billionaire, to the tune of $250 million in annual sales. At a moment when girls and women have never been more empowered, they are in thrall to ever more ruthless standards of beauty. This is likely not a coincidence. In her 1991 bombshell book, ""The Beauty Myth,"" a young Rhodes Scholar named Naomi Wolf observed that as the women's movement powers up, the beauty industry clamps down on our self-esteem. Unprecedented billions of marketing dollars have been unleashed to promote beauty as essential to female confidence. Yet beauty is defined in such a way as to be inaccessible to all but an elite few. Still, we buy into it. As our paychecks increase, so does our beauty spending -- and suffering. Is the price of freedom an actual pound of flesh? Not just freedom, as it turns out, but success. Beauty pays off -- literally. Cornell professor Michael Lynn has found that attractive waitresses make better tips. Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, studies pulchronomics, or the economics of beauty. In his book, ""Beauty Pays: Why Attractive People Are More Successful,"" he reports that attractive women are more likely to land a wealthy spouse, and that attractive American workers will earn $230,000 more in their lifetimes than their less fetching colleagues. Unattractive women are less likely to work at all than their attractive peers, a phenomenon that does not show up in men. Hamermesh goes so far as to propose legal protection for ""ugly"" people through an extension of the Americans With Disabilities Act. By this logic, is the nearly $4,000 a woman will spend on mascara in her lifetime a kind of perverse retirement investment? Apparently we women have to spend money to make money, though perhaps not in the way we anticipated. Lest the guys think this is yet another unfortunate burden for women to shoulder, think again. Men are showing up in the crosshairs of beauty marketers and under the knives of surgeons. Last year, fewer women had breast enlargements, but ""moobs"" -- that's man boobs -- clearly caused an unprecedented amount of anxiety. More than 21,000 breast reductions were performed on men, an increase of 5%. And in Hamermesh's work, men's salaries were docked more for unattractiveness than women's. My friend Lisa can't stop thinking about getting hit by the truck. ""The thing is,"" she told me, ""if I got run over it wouldn't be my fault, but being fat is something other people can blame me for."" That's precisely what beauty marketers want us to think: If we cripple our feet in heels, buy the Spanx, and go under the knife, hey, at least we tried. I can't help but wonder who we are trying for, and if the extra cash is worth it. The beauty industry is driving that truck, and it's going to hit us no matter what.

"(CNN) -- For all the creative destruction that the Internet has wrought over the last decade, there has been one constant: Google's remarkable dominance of the internet economy. In a ""Web 2.0"" world dominated by search and by the link, Google and its artificial algorithm have reigned supreme ever since the company's much vaunted IPO in August, 2004. But now, as we go from a Web 2.0 to a Web 3.0 economy, even the once invulnerable Google might be in trouble. Yes, for the first time in a decade, Google's global dominance of the Internet economy appears in jeopardy. This challenge to Google is twofold -- from both the market and from the government. The market threat comes from the increasing ubiquity of social media. The link economy is being replaced by the ""like"" economy in a Web 3.0 world described by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman as ""real identities generating massive amounts of data."" And the rise of social media with its avalanche of personal data is, of course, being primarily driven by Facebook, the locomotive of the like economy, with its near billion members and its expected $100 billion IPO later this year. The dramatic shift from traditional search to social media was underlined last week in a speech by Tanya Corduroy the London Guardian's director for digital development. Eighteen months ago, Corduroy revealed, search made up 40% of the Guardian's traffic and social only made up 2%. Last month, however, she acknowledged a ""seismic shift"" in the Guardian's referral traffic, with Facebook driving more traffic than Google and making up more than 30% of the newspaper's referrals. Of course, Google hasn't stood still in the face of the Facebook tsunami. First there were the social products Buzz and Wave, both of which were embarrassing failures. And then last year, Google launched the ""quasi Facebook competitor"" Google +, a product that one ex Google employee believes has ""ruined the company"" by trying to transform all Google products into social services. Indeed, Google has even launched a new search product called Search Plus Your World (SPYW), perhaps the company's most ""radical"" move in its history, which determines search results according to social rather than algorithmic criteria. While the jury is still out on the success of Google +, with data showing that users spent an average of only 3.3 minutes on the network last month, there is no doubt that Google is relentless about its desire to make itself the center of Web 3.0's social world. Larry Page, Google's new CEO, has even tied 25% of all bonuses to the success of the company's social strategy. See more: Report: Facebook bought 750 patents from IBM . Indeed, the problem might be that Google is trying too hard to transform itself into a social company. Google's announcement in late January, that it intended to consolidate personal data across its different products and services -- from Gmail to YouTube to Google + to SPYW to Google maps to traditional search - had one concerned technology writer suggest that Google will now know more about us than our wives. And while senior Google executives like Google + supremo Vic Gundotra promise that they won't break users' trust, more and more pundits fear that Google's obsession with keeping up with Facebook is making a mockery of its ""Do No Evil"" corporate mantra. In my view, Google is no more or less evil than a multi-national bank or oil company. But there is good reason to fear the company's insatiable appetite for our personal data in today's Web 3.0 world. That's because Google's business model remains primarily the sale of advertising around its free consumer products. Thus, Google's desire to intimately know us is primarily driven by its core business objective of -- one way or the other - selling that knowledge to advertisers.

This threat was laid out chillingly by the Center for Digital Democracy in a complaint about its new privacy policy to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC): ""In particular, Google fails to inform its users that the new privacy regime is based on its own business imperatives: To address competition from Facebook, to grow its capacity to finely profile and target through audience buying; to collect, integrate, and utilize a user's information in order to expand its social media, social search, and mobile marketing activities ..."" Governments around the world are, however, waking up to this threat. A number of U.S. lawmakers, for example, questioned the impact of this new policy on users' privacy. While earlier this week, the FTC published a 57-page report of privacy recommendations which included the addition of a ""do not track"" system intended to give us more control over our online data. And last month, the White House proposed its own ""Privacy bill of rights"" that depends on voluntary commitments by both Google and Facebook. But Google, driven by its Facebook envy, is in no mood to voluntarily commit to protecting our privacy. In spite of overt U.S. and European government pressure not to implement a policy that consolidates all our personal data across the company's many products and services, Google did indeed, on March 1, unilaterally move ahead with this controversial new privacy policy. And herein, I suspect, lies Google's greatest vulnerability. Late last month, France's data protection authority, the Commission Nationale de l'Information et des Libertes (CNIL) wrote to Larry Page warning him that Google's new privacy policy might be unlawful in the EU. The CNIL letter was strongly supported by EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding, who also requested that Google delayed the implementation of the policy. Next month, European Union regulators, led by Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, will announce their plans for pursuing an antitrust investigation into Google's broad business practices, particularly accusations by a number of companies including Microsoft, Travelocity, Expedia and Kayak that it has abused its dominant position in search. Given all the controversy surrounding the company's new privacy policy, don't be surprised if this contributes to Almunia formalizing the antitrust charges against Google. I suspect that 2012 will be remembered as the year when Google's fortunes began to wane. The company won't disappear, of course. But with an inexperienced new CEO, a badly botched new privacy policy, a marked decline in public trust and a looming EU antitrust investigation, it is hard to see Google dominating today's Web 3.0 world from the same unchallenged position as it once controlled the Web 2.0 economy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Keen.","Social media and government challenge Google's internet dominance of internet economy .

"(CNN) -- In a poll published last week by the American magazine Consumer Reports, 71% of adults polled confessed to being very concerned about Internet companies abusing their personal information. But what this poll failed to ask was whether we fear governmental abuse of our online data as much as abuse from private companies. So who do you fear more taking advantage of your online information: private Internet companies or the government? Forget Orwell. Forget the totalitarian Big Brother in ""Nineteen Eighty-Four."" For a more prescient glimpse of our electronically networked future, read ""Surveillance,"" Jonathan Raban's chilling 2007 novel about a paranoid society where everybody, particularly the snooping government, has become a voyeur of other people's lives. ""We're all spooks now,"" one character tells another. ""Look at the way people Google their prospective dates. Everybody does it. Everybody's trying to spy on everybody else."" Yes, in our creepy social media world of Facebook, Google + and Twitter, we can all become spooks. Indeed, as Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange noted, Facebook -- with its nearly billion members spewing out massive amounts of personal data -- ""is the most appalling spying machine that has been ever invented."" But, in today's radically transparent networked world where even spookery has been democratized, nobody does surveillance quite as effectively as the government. And in a contemporaneous political culture shaped by paranoia about crime and terrorism, governmental surveillance may be threatening to undermine our intrinsic individual rights to privacy. Raban's ""Surveillance"" is permeated by this paranoia. ""It's the t-t-t-talk of terrorism that t-terrorizes me,"" one character in the novel confesses. Yes, and it's this t-t-t-talk of terrorism, I'm afraid, that is now being used by the paranoid British government to justify its creation of an electronic surveillance state. Described by critics as the online ""snooping"" plan, the British government is trying to give the Home Office's monitoring agency, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), new powers to ""in certain circumstances"" monitor our Skype calls, instant-messages, emails and other online communications. The intended legislation requires ""communications service providers"" (ISPs and email providers) to install ""Deep Packet Inspection"" (DPI) technology hardware which would give GCHQ the ability, without a warrant, to monitor and intercept the times, dates, frequency and addresses (but not the actual content) of our online calls, emails and instant-messaging communications. So why? How is the British government justifying such a flagrant disregard of its citizens' basic right to privacy by giving GCHQ the right to inspect the details of our private online correspondence? It's the t-t-t-talk of terrorism. As CNN reported last week, the British Home Office argued that these intended laws were vital ""in certain circumstances to investigate serious crime and terrorism and to protect the public."" And, a ""highly placed source"" told The Telegraph about its fear of losing terrorists on the Internet, ""we need to take action to maintain the continued availability of communications data to the police and other agencies investigating criminality."" It's not just Britain, however, where government surveillance is threatening to undermine our right to private online communications. As The New York Times noted last week, GCHQ is run ""in close collaboration with the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States"". And as The Telegraph notes, both the NSA and the US department of Defense are already using Deep Packet Inspection technology -- in the name, of course, of the war against terrorism - to monitor Internet traffic in the US. Worse still, a privacy group called Privacy International has identified British, American, German and Israeli companies who are exporting spooky technologies like DPI hardware and equally sophisticated software products like ""optical cyber solutions"" that enable mass surveillance of large scale populations, to repressive regimes in the Middle East such as Yemen, Egypt, Syria and Iran. As Jo Glanville, the editor of Index on Censorship, asks, ""how can Western democracies back the fight for freedom in the Middle East while Western companies supply surveillance equipment to authoritarian governments in the same region?"" The use of surveillance technology by authoritarian regimes isn't, of course, only limited to the Middle East. In China, for example, dissidents like the artist Ai Weiwei are under constant state surveillance 24 hours a day. Indeed, last week, the Chinese authorities shut down a website, www.weiweicam.com, through which Weiwei was streaming live video of his own home via four webcams as a satirical statement against the surveillance regime in Beijing. ""Byebye to all voyeurs,"" Weiwei tweeted after his self-surveillance cameras were switched off. If only we could really bid adieu to all voyeurs. But the truth is that digital technologies such as DPI are enabling governments -- in the name of investigating criminals or terrorists -- to snoop more and more intimately upon us. And this is only going to get worse as we invent more and more invasive technologies that capture our most personal data. Take, for example, Google's augmented reality glasses which, with their ability to follow us everywhere we go, the Forbes columnist Kashmir Hill suggests, could ""make a persistent, pervasive surveillance state inevitable."" I'm not so sure about the inevitability of this surveillance state. But just as we need laws to protect us from Internet companies that seek to abuse our personal data, so we also need protection from today's snooping state. The EU commissioner of Justice, Viviane Reding is pressing for the European Parliament to establish ""right to be forgotten"" legislation that would establish strict rules for how private companies use our data. ""Worries about online privacy are one of the most frequent reasons for why people don't buy goods and services on the Web,"" Reding wrote in February. ""Our confidence in a digital future will depend on whether we know that our data will be safely protected."" Yes, Reding is correct. There is definitely a need to regulate private companies like Facebook and Google whose appetite for our most intimate data appears insatiable. But as we begin to worry about the snooping state, perhaps we need to consider the idea of broader ""right to be forgotten"" legislation directed against intelligence services like GCHQ or NSA, that would protect our private data in a digitally networked age where everyone, especially the government, is becoming a spook. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Keen.","The UK government has suggested new powers for monitoring of digital communications ""in certain circumstances.""
Keen: Such surveillance is threatening to undermine citizens' rights to private online communications.
The use of surveillance technology now extends beyond authoritarian regimes, says Keen.
Keen backs digital ""right to be forgotten"" legislation proposed by some legislators ."
"(CNN) -- The individual mandate might prove to be the death knell for President Barack Obama's health care reform. Politically, the polls have been clear. While most parts of the Affordable Care Act are immensely popular with the public, as recent data from the Kaiser Foundation has shown, the individual mandate is unpopular. (A CNN poll found that a bare majority of Americans oppose the mandate to buy health insurance.) The Supreme Court heard arguments last week over whether the mandate is constitutional, and the administration is now waiting to see if the court will dismantle this key part of the program -- or possibly throw out the entire health care law. Although the individual mandate was born out of conservative proposals in the 1990s -- an effort to lower costs by requiring people to buy into the private market rather than creating a government program -- the presence of the mandate is also a product of the timidity liberals have displayed about their ideas since the 1990s. As Princeton sociologist Paul Starr has written in the New Republic, during the 1990s the mandate was perceived as the ""conservative alternative to the Democrats' proposed mandate on employers to pay for a share of health insurance. The Republican proposal was thought to represent a more individualistic, market-friendly approach."" Whereas liberals were once willing to defend the role of the federal government in American life and, even more importantly, defend the costs that federal programs imposed on the citizenry, liberals since the Age of Clinton have relied on developing jerry-built solutions to domestic programs that are often unpalatable politically -- and don't accomplish their goals. For much of the 20th century, liberals argued that government was an essential part of national life and that Americans would have to live up to certain obligations to support social programs that came with the privileges of citizenry. During the New Deal, President Franklin Roosevelt was not bashful about defending the value of government. In 1935, for instance, Congress passed the Social Security Act in which the federal government took over the role of providing old age insurance to the elderly. To finance the benefits, Roosevelt and Congress created a payroll tax paid by workers and businesses. During World War II, as government spending skyrocketed as a result of defense needs, the Roosevelt administration supported a massive expansion of the income tax. When the war started, only 4 million people paid income taxes. When the war ended, 44 million people were paying and taxes were withheld directly from paychecks. The Treasury conducted a public relations campaign to sell the tax to Americans that emphasized that these were ""Taxes to beat the Axis."" At the movies, Americans saw short films where a voice explained to Donald Duck just how his money was being used (and how he could take as exemptions Huey, Louie, and Dewey). This liberal ethic flourished for decades, even as liberals remained leery of the power of conservatism and aware of the long tradition of resistance to government in America. During the 1960s, Lyndon Johnson, who avoided proposing any tax increases until 1967, did talk to citizens about how a wealthy nation could afford to pay for programs that dealt with issues such as poverty and urban decay. With civil and voting rights, he called on the government to do what the private sector would not do on its own. On health care, Johnson and Congress created Medicare, which provided for a government takeover of the insurance costs of hospital stays for the elderly, funded through higher payroll taxes. When Ted Kennedy championed health care, his vision was still very much akin to the ""single- payer"" model of other countries where the government would be the insurer of first resort. But during the 1980s, after Ronald Reagan entered the White House and the modern conservative era began, liberals retreated into a defensive stance. After Democratic candidate Walter Mondale suffered at the polls in the 1984 campaign when he admitted that he would call for higher taxes, most Democrats were resistant to proposing any kind of revenue increase. The shift could be seen with health care. When President Bill Clinton proposed health care reform in 1993, he avoided the single-payer model that had been favored by older liberals like Kennedy for decades and instead opted for a complex system that aimed to create new mechanisms for offering and purchasing health insurance and stronger regulations to lower costs. The complexity of Clinton's plan, which involved an employer mandate, left his program vulnerable to attack from Republicans who characterized it as a Frankenstein monster that would result in massive deficits. Obama fell into a similar trap with health care. Although he was more open than many of his predecessors to championing an active government, he acted from a defensive posture. His health care proposal was even less ambitious than that of Clinton. He essentially chose a path that regulated the existing system and required all Americans to be part of it. Obama was not enthusiastic about any kind of single-payer option to compete with private markets and he allowed Congress to drop the public option that would create an alternative to private insurance. The result was an extraordinarily complex system, which depended on a mandate requiring the purchase of private insurance to make sure that costs were covered. The government intervention was indirect; the financing mechanisms were murky. It is not surprising that the individual mandate has caused so many problems. At its core, the mandate constitutes a conservative solution to the problem of costs and part of an effort by liberals to ensure health care coverage without resorting to the kinds of government interventions that liberals once championed. Obama ultimately promoted the health care bill as a cost-cutting measure that would create greater efficiency in markets. He did not focus as much as his predecessors on the right to affordable health care that is implicit in the name of the bill. While conservatives have attacked the program -- focusing on the mandate -- with great clarity, the president's hesitant defense of this complex system has done little to rally the public behind it. Now he must wait to see if the Supreme Court offers his critics justification that he overreached with his agenda. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Zelizer: Since Reagan, liberals have been cautious about expanding government .
Conservatives first backed a private health care mandate in the 1990s .
Obama touted efficiency in his bill, not the right to affordable care, Zelizer says .
Obama's hesitant defense of a complex bill hasn't inspired support, he says ."
"(CNN) -- In June 1212, some 30,000 people, most of them children, massed in the center of France. This mob of Christian kids - remembered by historians as The Children's Crusade - was on its way to Jerusalem to liberate it from an infidel who, it was rumored, ate children. Eight hundred years later, the connected children in today's Facebook world have it much easier. Today, in what we might dub the Children's Crusade 2.0, tens of millions of innocent kids have found a new Jerusalem to liberate. It's called Africa and their liberation vehicle is the ""Kony2012"" viral video commodifying innocence that has been watched 80 million times since its release last week. This time though, the kids don't even need to leave home to go on their crusade. All it takes is a click of a mouse and $15 to liberate the world from an infidel who catches, disfigures and eats children. And this time, they might even get a bracelet and an ""action kit"" to memorialize their participation in this struggle against almighty evil. Yes, Africa -- and specifically Uganda -- has been reduced to a meme. An online meme spread like a rash by hyper-connected kids on global networks like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. It's no coincidence that ""Kony2012,"" part ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" and part ""Star Wars,"" begins with the video of a birth. Our Facebook world changes everything, the movie promises its audience of children. We are told that ""the game has new rules."" The world has been turned upside down by social media, the eschatological video explains, and now ""a bunch of littles can make difference."" ""We can change the course of human history,"" ""Kony2012"" promises its audience of littles. We can do that, it promises, by creating a network of millions of kids who will catch Joseph Kony, the Ugandan warlord described by Gavin, the deliciously blonde, four-year-old star of the movie, as a ""big bad guy."" ""Kony abducts kids just like Gavin,"" the movie's narrator, Jason Russell -- who just happens to be Gavin's dad --- tells us. Joseph Kony forces kids to kill their own parents and mutilate people's faces. He is the personification of evil, the antichrist of Christian eschatology, the sort of monster who, 800 years ago, inspired 30,000 kids to leave home and set sail to Jerusalem. ""Kony2012"" may be in poor taste, but it's rich in irony. And it's particularly ironic that the most viral YouTube video of all time was made by a non-profit group called ""Invisible Children"". Children are many things these days, but they certainly aren't invisible -- especially on the Internet, where it is the kids, these adolescent messengers, who are becoming the McLuhanite message of our networked age. The glossily seductive ""Kony2012"" was explicitly designed for kids. In defense of his movie, Jason Russell said on CNN that he thinks of ""Kony2012"" as being owned by children because ""the youth of the world"" has funded it. Invisible Children's CEO, Ben Keesey, even acknowledged to the Wall Street Journal that the movie was made to appeal to children. ""How do we make this translate to a 14-year-old who has just walked out of algebra class?"" Keesey said of Invisible Children's thinking behind the movie. And the kids of the world, those millions of innocent 14-year-olds who walked from their algebra class to the nearest screen, have repaid Invisible Children by turning ""Kony2012"" into one of the most viral products in history. Yes, outraged celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Rihanna, who unselfishly showed off her breasts for Invisible Children, helped spread the word. But it's the children who have transformed the big mustachioed Joseph Kony from a has-been Ugandan warlord into the second-coming of Adolf Hitler (whose little mustachioed face is, of course, also featured in the video). Even the most informed bloggers on the Internet, like GigaOm's Mathew Ingram, A-list blogger Jeff Jarvis and Columbia University's Emily Bell all discovered ""Kony2012"" through their kids. ""I am watching https://twitter.com/ ' my 11 yr old:'oh I've seen that: I've already emailed it to my grade'.This is the new news cycle,"" Bell, who heads up Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism, tweeted last week. In a way then, all the messianic promise of ""Kony 2012"" is eerily prescient. The world has been turned on its head and the game does, indeed, have new rules. In our radically democratic age, it's the kids rather than the grown-ups who are curating the news, identifying the bad guys, perhaps even architecting the moral thrust of U.S. foreign policy. Writing in the New York Times at the weekend, the cultural critic Douglas Coupland observed: ""In the past decade that we appear to have entered an aura-free universe in which all eras coexist at once -- a state of possibly permanent atemporality given to us courtesy of the Internet. No particular era now dominates. We live in a post-era era without forms of its own powerful enough to brand the times."" Coupland is right. But in what he calls ""our new world of flattened time and space,"" I wonder if we are also seeing, alongside the radical democratization of time and space, the flattening of age. In a post-era era world of ""Kony2012,"" with its harrypotterfication of reality and its transformation of Africa from a complex, infinitely nuanced society into a manichaean Madison Avenue fantasy of good and evil, are we all now becoming teenagers? I hope not. 800 years ago, back in 1212, the Children's Crusade ended in shipwreck and enslavement. Today's digital version of that innocent crusade, led by the pied-pipers from Invisible Children, probably won't end so tragically. But should we really be empowering children to make moral decisions about a world in which they have little experience? Should we entrust the innocent, that ""bunch of littles"" who have made ""Kony2012"" such an instant hit, to architect our brave new connected world? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Keen .","Keen: Tens of millions of innocent kids have found a new Jerusalem to liberate .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A man alleged to be a local Afghan policeman killed an American service member in eastern Afghanistan on Monday, while two British troops were shot and killed by an Afghan soldier in the southern province of Helmand, according to U.S., NATO and Afghan officials. The British troops were killed outside a Provincial Reconstruction Team's headquarters in the southern city of Lashkar Gah, NATO and local officials said. Coalition forces then fatally shot the gunman. A spokesman for the provincial governor said the incident stemmed from an argument the soldier had with the victims. The eastern Afghanistan victim was an American soldier, a senior U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN. NATO said he was shot as he approached an Afghan local police checkpoint; it said Afghan and coalition forces are investigating the incident but released no further details. Monday's deaths bring to 93 the number of coalition service members who have died in Afghanistan this year, 44 of them Americans. In 2012 to date, 16 have been killed in what are euphemistically called ""green on blue"" attacks, meaning Afghan troops who have turned their weapons on allied forces. In some attacks, insurgents have disguised themselves as Afghan soldiers in order to infiltrate bases. But the incidents have fueled mutual distrust at a critical juncture of the long-running conflict. The latest killings come after a shooting rampage in Afghanistan this month left 17 villagers dead in the Panjwai district of southern Kandahar province. A U.S. soldier, Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, has been charged with murder in the slayings. Speaking after the deaths of the two British soldiers on Monday, Gen. John Allen, the ISAF commander, said he could not discount revenge as a factor. ""I don't connect the two of those, but in any case it is prudent for us to recognize that, as you know, revenge is an important dimension in this culture,"" Allen told a briefing in Washington. ""I have seen no indications yet that it has emerged as a potential factor, but we will certainly keep an eye on it."" Allen said ISAF officials are working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of Afghans who sign up for the army or police force, and the Afghans ""have taken a lot of steps themselves."" ""They've worked very closely within the national director of security to place counterintelligence operatives inside their schools, inside their recruiting centers, and inside the ranks, the idea being to spot and assess the potential emergence of an individual who could be an extremist or, in fact, a Taliban infiltrator,"" he said. But in an appearance at the Brookings Institution on Monday afternoon, he acknowledged that previous attacks by Afghan forces have led to ""an erosion of trust."" ""I believe that the relationship is very strong nonetheless,"" Allen added. Disputes can arise from cultural misunderstanding, religious and ideological friction or combat stress, said Brig. Gen. Stephen Townsend, director of the Pakistan/Afghanistan Coordination Cell in the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff office. Townsend said cultural training has been vital for U.S. soldiers, and now the Afghans are considering the same to provide a better understanding of Americans. The Helmand governor on Monday praised ISAF troops for their sacrifices and assistance to the Afghan people. ""The enemies of the people and peace want to finish confidence among Afghan and ISAF forces, but they will never cover their evil aims by carrying out such violent acts,"" he said in a statement. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat and Larry Shaughnessy and journalist Ruhullah Khapalwak contributed to this report.","NEW: ISAF commander says attacks have caused ""an erosion of trust""

"(CNN) -- For decades, Mike Wallace defined the image of the hard-charging investigative reporter. News of his death at 93 came Sunday and with it a multitude of remembrances and assessments of a complex man. Wallace's longevity and his medium -- the TV network -- put a face on investigative reporting for the public. His career reflected how investigative journalism evolved from the 1950s into the 21st century -- and showed why we still need it. We watched his work on ""60 Minutes"" go from undercover tactics and ambush interviews in the 1970s to pieces that relied more on documents and analysis -- and in which targets were not entirely surprised by what was coming. We also watched as Wallace showed how complex and confrontational investigative reporting can be. He spoke openly of subjects dodging interviews and of management and corporate interference in investigative stories. He acknowledged many of his own flaws and revealed his clinical depression resulting from the stresses of the work. We watched too as he underwent two major controversies that would have demolished other careers. One was a $120 million libel suit by Gen. William C. Westmoreland over a story that said the military had deceived the American public about the size of opposition forces during the Vietnam War. The suit was eventually withdrawn but not before it had damaged reputations and sent Wallace into depression. The second was over an investigation into the tobacco industry that led to a fierce internal dispute at CBS on airing the story. Eventually, all the information came out and Wallace criticized his own bosses at CBS. But the controversy still resulted in a film highly critical of the network and Wallace's handling of the story. In addition to those controversies, his methods periodically came under attack from inside journalism, and friendships were lost and colleagues estranged or disillusioned. However, the public stuck with him -- perhaps because he continued to give hope that liars could be exposed, that dangerous practices could be stopped and wrongheaded policies overturned. Backed by a series of talented reporters and producers over the years, he was the front man -- the ""closer"" so to speak -- for teams of investigative journalists and for the public. In the theater of the interview, he conveyed the outrage and skepticism of journalists who spent months digging for the truth. One of his former producers, Charles Lewis, wrote Sunday, ""Mike Wallace will go down in history as the finest investigative interviewer on the most popular and most honored network television news program in U.S. history."" Lewis, a founder of two nonprofit investigative journalism centers, added, ""At 60 Minutes, he literally set the gold standard for fearless, 'tough but fair,' go-for-the-jugular questioning and showed the world and the profession how investigative television news could look, should look."" Wallace also exemplified a very American attitude that no matter how powerful someone is, he or she is expected to answer to the public for actions taken and mistakes made. When he confronted someone, many viewers felt Wallace represented their frustrations and spoke for them. When Wallace said the subject of an interview had to be kidding, he really meant the subject had to be kidding everyone watching. Before the camera, he embodied the democratic attitude that everyone is equal and everyone is accountable. In the end, one might wonder how he could continue to get those interviews after all those years of blistering confrontations, but I got a clue in 2000. At the time, I was executive director of the professional organization Investigative Reporters and Editors and Wallace had been invited to be on a showcase panel at the annual conference in New York City. He came half an hour early and cheerily talked with the conference staff. But while waiting backstage he suddenly said he needed one of his well-known catnaps. We offered to get a cot, but he said no thanks, folded his suit jacket inside out into a pillow, lay down on the floor and promptly fell asleep. For 10 minutes the staff delicately stepped over and around him. Then he got up, completely alert, thanked everyone for inviting him, and smiling went on stage to chat with a thousand journalists. I suspect it was that kind of regular guy attitude that got so many to talk to him, to believe in him, and even some of his targets to forgive him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brant Houston.","Brant Houston: Mike Wallace, who died Sunday at 93, defined image of hard-charging reporter .

"(CNN) -- Earlier this week, Pete Cashmore, the founder of Mashable, published his top 10 trends for 2012. And while Cashmore's list is characteristically prescient, it misses one trend which I suspect will increasingly shape our attitude toward technology over the next year. So let me add an 11th trend of 2012: Next year, we will become increasingly preoccupied with the relationship between new digital technologies and employment. 2012 will be the year that it finally dawns on us that more digital technology might mean fewer regular jobs and that robots could be replacing human beings as the critical labor constituency of our ""new economy."" Cashmore's own Mashable website gave us a sneak preview of this revolution in August when it reported on the decision of Foxconn, Apple's Chinese manufacturer, to replace a large part of its workforce with one million robots. And in 2012, I predict, these kinds of strategic investments in artificial intelligence -- from consumer products like Apple's Siri and Google's self-driving car to automated industrial factories -- will become ever more commonplace. Next year, we will also see an increasing debate about the connection between new technology and jobs. This is a debate that will particularly focus on the impact of digital technology on average workers. It will pit what we might call ""innovation fundamentalists"" against ""innovation skeptics."" Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO and its current executive chairman, is a classic example of an innovation fundamentalist. ""Innovators create millions of jobs in America,"" the multi-billionaire mogul told CNN's Erin Burnett last week on OutFront about what he believes is the inevitably positive impact of new technology, particularly information technology, upon employment. But even though innovation fundamentalism remains the core orthodoxy in Silicon Valley, not every digital mogul shares Schmidt's faith in the magical impact of innovation on jobs. Last month, for example, at the Oxford Union, the debating society of Oxford University, we got a sneak preview of the kind of debate about our digital economy that we will become ever more resonant in 2012. ""This house believes that the average worker is being left behind by advances in technology"", the Union debate -- a part of the annual Silicon Valley Comes to Oxford conference -- was framed. And among those arguing that the average worker is, indeed, being left behind by technologyl were innovation skeptics like Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn and two distinguished MIT economists, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee. ""The androids are coming and they work even cheaper than the Chinese do,"" argued McAfee in the Union debate. He went on to explain that the combined American labor force of Facebook, Apple, Amazon was less than 150,000 workers -- a number, he explained, that was smaller than the average number of people entering the American workforce each month. McAfee then warned the Oxford audience about the cloud-based storage company Dropbox, the so-called current ""darling"" of Silicon Valley. He said Dropbox was bringing in $270 million in revenue from 40 million users and yet employed only 70 people. Not surprisingly perhaps, the Union motion was carried by a more than 3 to 1 margin. Brynjolffson and McAfee are also the co-authors of ""Race Against The Machine: How the Digital Revolution is Accelerating Innovation, Driving Productivity, and Irreversibly Transforming Employment and the Economy,"" a controversial new e-book which argues that the creative destruction of today's digital revolution is actually leaving millions of people behind. While they are argue that technological innovation is certainly making us more productive, it is not, they worry, either raising average American income or generating more jobs for average workers. It's important to note that skeptics like Brynjolffson and McAfee aren't luddites and ""Race Against the Machine"" is distinguished by a substantive final chapter which outlines a series of a prescriptions and recommendations of what needs to be done to more effectively combine technological innovation and jobs. Proactive education, entrepreneurship and investment policy are the keys to guaranteeing that new technology will produce more jobs for average workers, the MIT economists write. I have to confess that I share the concerns of entrepreneurs like Reid Hoffman and economists like Brynjolffson and McAfee about the impact of new technology on average workers. Like them, I worry that dynamic new global companies like Dropbox, Facebook and Google don't require the labor of average workers. I thus welcome the debate about technology and labor that we are about to have in 2012. Traditional media's decline is our loss . In his excellent summary of 2011, Cashmore argues that ""the pace of change has become blisteringly fast, with traditional industries -- bookstores, video-rental chains, newspapers -- crumbling more quickly than we could have imagined."" Yet while Cashmore is right to describe the pace of change in 2011 as ""blisteringly fast"", he is wrong to suggest that nobody imagined the ""crumbling"" of old media industries like Blockbuster video rental stores and Borders bookstores. Indeed, one of the most impressive of this year's non-fiction books, Robert Levine's ""Free Ride: How Digital Parasites Are Destroying the Culture Business, and How the Culture Business Can Fight Back,"" charts this demise and argues that it can be blamed, in part, on the online economy's misguided focus on free content and the self-interested permissiveness of powerful digital companies toward online piracy. In many ways, Levine's argument is also about the relationship between technology and employment. Rather than the android, however, Levine's enemy is the online pirate whose theft of intellectual property has resulted, he says, in many thousands of creative professionals losing their jobs. Levine's argument puts him in the camp of innovation skeptics. Like Hoffman and McAfee, this former Billboard editor is not against technology and recognizes that, for better or worse, the digital revolution is an unavoidable reality of our age. But ""Free Ride"" is a carefully calibrated reminder that there is nothing either inevitable or beneficial about the crumbling of many traditional media companies and that we, as regular consumers of music, books and movies, are the ultimate losers when these industries decline. Artificial intelligence: Good or bad? I've already mentioned two of my top five 2011 books: Levine's ""Free Ride"" and McAfee and Brynjolfsson's ""Race Against The Machine."" The next two pretty much pick themselves. Walter Isaacson's blockbuster ""Steve Jobs"" is a rich and balanced biography of the ultimate innovation fundamentalist, ultra-willing to sacrifice everything and everyone at the altar of technological creativity. While James Gleick's acclaimed ""The Information: a History, a Theory, a Flood,"" is a brilliant analysis of why and how information has become the motor of the early 21st century's innovation economy. My final choice is Tyler Cowen's ""The Great Stagnation: How American Ate All the Low-Hanging Fruit of Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better,"" which addresses the relationship between technological innovation and prosperity. Cowen, an economist at George Mason university, blows up every orthodoxy. He argues there hasn't been much technological innovation over the last 50 years which, he notes, explains the scarcity of ordinary jobs in today's economy. Ironically, Cowen pins his hopes for future prosperity on the commercial success of artificial intelligence technology -- a development which, of course, McAfee and Brynjolfsson blame for today's unemployment crisis.

"(CNN) -- A Red Sox star used blue language, but he won't be fined any green for his emotional reaction the day after police captured marathon bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev.

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Speculation about vice presidential picks is heating up. As it has become increasingly clear that Mitt Romney will win the Republican nomination, there has been all kinds of chatter about who he will pick to run with him on the ticket. There has even been some talk about whether President Obama would consider replacing Vice President Biden with another running mate if Democrats felt their campaign needed more juice. HBO's film version of the book ""Game Change"" offers a powerful reminder of the perils that come from making a bad choice. The conventional wisdom stipulates that vice presidential selections will rarely help a candidate win an election, but the wrong choice can be devastating. With John McCain in 2008 this was certainly true. Although there were many factors that led to Barack Obama's victory, picking Palin severely weakened his campaign. Vice presidential picks are not an opportunity to make a game change, at least in a positive direction. When McCain turned to Palin, he did so in an effort to overcome many of his perceived weaknesses against candidate Obama -- his inability to attract the base of his party, fears that he would appear to look like the ""older"" candidate in the race, as well as the concern that he was a less charismatic candidate in the eyes of the media. Clearly the Palin pick backfired. What can Romney and others learn from this episode? The first lesson is that vice presidential picks should be boring. In the end, Mitt Romney must overcome his weaknesses as a candidate by what he does on the campaign trail, not by who he picks as his running mate. Having the right person stand beside you rarely will change the way the public sees you. But calling on the wrong person can draw all the focus away from the campaign's main themes and raise serious concerns about the competence of the candidate. Very often, less than exciting candidates -- Dick Cheney in 2000, Sen. Al Gore in 1992 or George H.W. Bush in 1980 -- turned out to be perfect primarily because they didn't cause much of a stir. When it comes to vice presidential candidates, less attention is better. A second lesson is that candidates must make sure that their running mate can handle the national spotlight in the modern media age. It's far different to be a rock star in Anchorage than it is in Washington. With all the outlets for news today, with cable television, the Internet and social media constantly finding and supplying information, it is very difficult to contain charges or gaffes before they go viral. And despite all the criticism that our current politics are shallow, the fact is that competence can matter very much when candidates stand before the media. When Palin stumbled in her interviews on national television about basic foreign policy questions, the media immediately exposed her flaws. Katie Couric's questions did huge damage to Palin in 2008 in a manner that most Democrats could only have dreamed of doing. A third lesson is that appealing to the party's base during the general election is not always the best move to make. After all, Romney's chief asset remains the fact that he is the moderate Republican in the campaign, the Republican who has the best chance to win over independents and disaffected moderate Democrats in November. It is difficult for a candidate to pick someone as a running mate who is far to the right but still maintains credibility with centrist voters. The vice presidential nominee can quickly drag the main candidate to the right, as McCain learned. When Palin made an increasingly strident appeal to the right, lambasting Obama as a radical leftist and even someone who was un-American, the tone of the entire McCain campaign changed. The most dramatic moment came when McCain literally felt the need to take the microphone back at a rally and correct a woman who said that Obama was ""an Arab."" But by then it was too late. Many loyal Republicans privately admitted that they couldn't vote for their candidate with Palin on the ticket. One of McCain's biggest potential virtues -- his appeal to moderates -- was gone. The best way for Romney to win over the base will be to run a strong campaign as the candidate he is. In the recent primaries in Maryland, The Hill reported that Romney was finally gaining traction with Tea Party Republicans without achieving any huge transformation of his image. The final lesson is less negative. McCain was correct when he decided, like Bush before him, that choosing a vice president from a particular region was no longer decisive. Long gone are the days when John F. Kennedy, from Massachusetts, picked Lyndon Johnson of Texas as a running mate to win southern votes. Now candidates think nationally, focusing on how a vice presidential choice will complement their national campaign and strengthen positive perceptions that voters have. While in Palin's case the choice did not work out, this is the way that Romney must think about his selection, just as Obama did when he picked Biden from the small state of Delaware. Overall, Romney needs to pick someone who voters feel could handle the presidency in an emergency and, perhaps even more importantly, someone who won't derail the campaign strategy. Otherwise, like McCain, Romney might end up making the wrong kind of game changing decision.

"(CNN) -- Lost in the laughter over the past two weeks has been GOP presidential candidate and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's core point about America's future in space. We shouldn't just explore space, we should develop and even settle it, using the same enterprise-friendly approaches that helped open the West and the skies. As a former NASA executive, it is clear to me that most commentators don't understand this is now possible, let alone necessary. David Frum's recent CNN viewpoint is eerily similar to what critics have said about other visionary ideas during America's history. In 1844, Asa Whitney (cousin of cotton gin inventor Eli Whitney) proposed to the U.S. Congress that America build a transcontinental railroad. U.S. Sen. Thomas Benton of Missouri responded that it was ""an imposture, a humbug; it could have emanated only from a madman ... science was unequal to overcome the Allegheny Mountains -- and now Whitney proposed to scale the Rocky Mountains, four or five times as high! Why sir, it's madness!""... ""You are one hundred years before your time."" The golden spike was pounded into the ground in Utah just 25 years later. In 1867, Secretary of State William Seward proposed that America purchase Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million. Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune mocked Seward, calling it ""a frozen wasteland."" Alaska became known as ""Seward's Folly."" It was one of the best investments America ever made. David Frum: A moon colony is a waste of money . To be fair, Frum makes a point that must be addressed: . ""With the greatest respect,"" Frum wrote, ""'the wonder and glory of it' is not a very compelling answer to the question: 'What do I get for my hundred billion bucks?'"" The answer is that we shouldn't spend that much, and certainly not for ""wonder and glory."" Gingrich's core point is that we must change how and why we do space by leveraging the power of free enterprise. Whatever misgivings you might have about Gingrich, in this case he is right. American history proves that smart, focused action by the U.S. government can jump start entire new industries that open new frontiers -- from western railroads, to the air, to the Internet - and that is exactly where we are today in space. In 2011, I led a NASA team that designed a strategy that could return America to the moon in 10 years for $40 billion. We can do so by using existing launch vehicles. More importantly, this strategy could also enable a new commercial space-plane industry and fundamentally enhance U.S. national security. Space launch today costs about $10,000 per pound. Our national security space systems are dominated by small numbers of multibillion-dollar satellites. Innovation is slow. It takes over a decade to plan, develop and introduce new systems. A large army of people watches over each satellite. If this reminds you of mainframe computers in the mid-1970s, then you know this sector of our economy is ripe for innovation. Reusable space planes will forever change the space industry. The ability to launch frequently, reliably and at much lower cost will promote experimentation and enable new solutions. NASA's Office of the Chief Technologist concluded that America has the basic technology to build space planes now. The primary problem is the proven market is not large or certain enough to justify the investments required. A Wall Street investment advisory firm, Near Earth LLC, independently validated our conclusion. We've been here before. In the 1850s, it was not possible to close the business case for a transcontinental railroad. The size, cost and risk of the private investment was too large. Then Congress passed the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862. American entrepreneurs connected a continent and provided rapid, reliable, low-cost access across the country. They quickly accomplished what had been deemed impossible two decades earlier. America was never to be invaded again; no one would dare. We were firmly on the path to become a world superpower. Fast forward to the 1920s. Airline entrepreneurs were unable to raise the capital to purchase new airplanes because the passenger travel market was considered speculative. Then Congress passed the Kelly Airmail Act of 1925. With airmail contracts in hand, private airlines sprouted up all over America. Passenger travel grows exponentially. Less than two decades later, U.S. airpower helps win World War II. Today, we are at a similar juncture. We have lost world leadership in commercial space transportation. But we can recapture it with totally reusable space planes. Space planes are the transcontinental railroad of our generation. Space planes will open the next frontier -- the greater Earth-moon system -- to economic activity and bind it together. Space planes will radically lower launch costs leading to new applications, new industries and new jobs. The growth in demand will lead to even higher flight rates, lower costs and new opportunities. As this virtuous cycle takes hold, America's role as the preeminent world leader in space will be assured for the next 50 years. U.S. national security will be permanently enhanced. And we will get a little wonder and glory, too. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter. Join the conversation on Facebook.

"(CNN) -- A reporter last week asked me if many people cared about the release of individual records from the 1940 Census. ""Are they just a historic relic?"" was the followup from someone else unimpressed that the general public would finally have access to more than 100 million census records locked away for 72 years. Americans answered those questions loud and clear. The National Archives and Records Administration website housing 1940 Census records registered over 60 million hits in just three hours on Tuesday, April 3, 2012, the second day they were open. The outpouring of demand for such information calls on us to examine what is driving it. The individual records help Americans gain a greater sense of who our ancestors were and with it an understanding of the blood that runs through our own veins. Each image from the 1940 Census is a lined page called a population schedule, containing the records of up to 40 individuals. They might not look like much -- the penmanship of 123,000 census takers varied, the cursive may be hard to read, ink from fountain pens ran too light on some letters. One line on a 1940 Census record, however, has the power to confirm a family legend we have heard for years, or it can make us confront a troubling truth buried long ago. The National Archives' innovative move of putting scans of these 3.9 million pages online has democratized genealogy. We might have expected that the first wave of retirees from the nation's nearly 77 million baby boomers would pause to reflect on the world their parents inhabited. We might have expected the too-rapidly dwindling ranks of World War II veterans to look for a glimpse of home life in the months before 15 million of them entered the services. When the 1930 Census records and those from earlier decades were released, searches largely were confined to people able to trek to National Archives facilities and depository libraries to work through microfilms produced by the Census Bureau in the 1930s and 40s. Now the 1940 census records are available for free, and millions of people are accessing them. The fascination with the snapshot of the United States provided by the 1940 Census runs beyond any one individual's search for her or his own past. The statistics available online now from the Census Bureau can deepen people's understanding of the towns and times their ancestors inhabited. Las Vegas, Nevada, had exploded in size with construction of the Hoover Dam.Â  Its population stood at 8,422. Around 9 million U.S. households used ice boxes to preserve their food. Family members finding their grandmother had completed four years of college by 1940 will learn that her accomplishment put her among the top 5% of U.S. residents in terms of education. Genealogists have been looking forward to this release as they would a national holiday, as have thousands of historians, economists and demographers. The release of the 1940 Census records will allow them to shed a light on a United States very different from how we live now. Community profiles of smaller population groups of the type so commonly released now by the Census Bureau with data from the American Community Survey were not published from the 1940 Census during days of World War II. When it is released, the Minnesota Population Center's database of digitized 1940 census records will allow researchers to build such profiles. They will be able to aggregate individual items into their own tables and run analyses. To get an idea of the diversity of nationalities in the United States at the time, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Census Proclamation, urging Americans to participate, was translated into 23 languages, including Slovak, Greek, Lithuanian, Russian, Dutch, Hebrew, Serbo-Croatian, French, Italian, Spanish, German. Because residents in 1940 answered census takers' questions, the records released last week will provide a glimpse of Navajo tribal lands on the eve of the uranium boom, which transformed the landscape. Economists will be able to analyze how people in specific occupations or smaller geographic areas fared during the Great Depression. The possibilities are vast. The 1940 Census gave the country in 1940 a snapshot, one moment frozen in time. That portrait attracts us because it was taken on the edge of momentous change -- a time when Americans began developing many of the tools we now take for granted. The United States instituted its first peacetime draft in September 1940; and the ranks of the armed forces mushroomed. Unemployment fell from around 15% for the week before Census Day 1940 to around 4.7% by 1942. Citing unprecedented movements of the population to areas with heavy concentrations of armaments manufacturing and responding to the administration's orders, the Census Bureau unveiled a 1941 plan to conduct an annual sample census. When that plan faltered for lack of funding, more than 200 communities paid the Census Bureau to conduct censuses within their jurisdictions between 1941 and 1946 alone. Today those communities base much of their decision-making on data from the descendant of those plans, the American Community Survey. Because Americans opened their doors to census takers in 1940 and the survey interviewers who followed them, the United States had the information President Franklin Roosevelt assured them was necessary ""to guide us intelligently into the future."" The Census Bureau thanked the millions of respondents in 1940 and the thousands of households responding to surveys each month since then; we their heirs should thank them now.

"(CNN) -- Friday's weak jobs report is more than a disappointing blip. It is a glimpse ahead of our disappointing future. Nearly three years from the beginning of the economic recovery in the summer of 2009, the U.S. economy has replaced not even half the jobs lost in the slump of 2007-2009. At the current pace of job creation, it will take until 2017 to replace all the jobs lost. But of course the population has grown since 2007, so ""replacement"" is not good enough. We are even further away from equaling the employment rate of 2007 -- the proportion of the working-age population at work. Even when (or if) full job recovery does come, it will not restore the economy of 2007 just as it was. Recessions reshape economies. The best book written about the social effects of the Great Recession is Don Peck's ""Pinched."" Peck shows us a new world emerging from the catastrophe of 2008, a new world that most Americans will find harsher than the old. For example: Despite the long, slow relative decline of manufacturing as a source of American jobs, the total number of manufacturing jobs in the United States had remained constant at about 18 million for decades. Between 2007 and 2009, the number of manufacturing jobs dropped by 6 million. While manufacturing is beginning a recovery now, it seems impossible that the sector will regenerate to anything like its former extent. The new jobs being added to the U.S. economy pay less, on average, than the jobs lost -- which is why the average rate of pay in the United States remains stagnant or even drops as the number of jobs slowly grows. At the top of the economic heap, recovery has been more complete. The richest Americans suffered sharp shocks to their wealth when markets collapsed in 2008-2009. As financial markets have revived, so has the wealth of the top 1% (households earning more than $380,000 per year.) The top 5% have done OK, too. (The top 5% begins a little south of $200,000 in household income.) For most of the country, however, the outlook is -- to borrow Peck's title -- ""pinched."" Young people who come of age in the crisis will earn less through their lives than those who came of age during happier times. Marriages break up. Babies are not born. A sense of unfairness spreads through the society. Politics becomes angrier and more paranoid -- for those who take part -- while many others drop out of public life entirely, disregarded and alienated. The country's political class tends to discuss these hard economic and cultural facts as if they were interesting only in relation to the presidential race, as if the only questions that mattered about economics were: ""Good for Obama?"" ""Bad for Obama?"" For most of the country, however, Barack Obama is a flickering electronic image, an only intermittently interesting distraction from the realities of life: stagnant pay, unattractive job options, darkening retirement prospects for the middle-aged and narrowing opportunities for the young. What would it take to do better? The answer, ironically, will be nearly equally difficult (but in very different ways) for politicians of either party. To do better, we'll need a program to stimulate employment for the long-term unemployed -- including potentially a New Deal-style requirement that nobody receive benefits without working. It's no good to anybody -- the unemployed least of all -- to allow the unemployed to collect two years' worth of benefits while waiting at home, their skills atrophying, their resumes going stale. To do better, we may need to induce employers to create jobs, not only through tax cuts but through direct subsidies, including subsidies of the cost of health coverage. (Especially for older workers, health costs can be more of a deterrent to hiring even than the cost of wages.) We will need to curtail the generosity of Medicare to open fiscal room for government programs to support opportunities for the young. We will need a permissive monetary policy that accepts moderate inflation to reduce the burden of mortgages and other debts -- even if it bites a little into savings and fixed incomes. We'll need above all to recognize the magnitude of the social distress we still face, even as the economic statistics tell us of a recovery that moves financial markets and presidential polls -- but that threatens to bypass tens of millions of Americans for months and years.

"(CNN) -- In the next week North Korea will launch a satellite to coincide with the 100th birthday of Kim Il Sung, the late ""Great Leader,"" and the man perhaps most responsible for the reclusive state's status as the world's most irresponsible country. But Kim's ""birthday present"" also means North Korea's people will have to forgo 240,000 metric tons of food aid from the United States, as well as the prospect of further negotiations aimed at bringing their country in from the cold. There are no good options for how we should respond. There never are with the North Koreans. But working closely with our partners is a good place to start. We must ensure the launch strengthens our partnerships rather than weakens them. It is difficult at this point to assess what happened to make the North Koreans essentially renege on the deal. Many analysts have made the case that this is typical North Korean behavior. That is true, but with an important caveat: The North Koreans usual way of doing things is first to pull out of a negotiation over some issue that would not be an issue among normal countries, but becomes a deal breaker for this ""exceptional nation."" North Korea parades launch pad for world media . After a period of time, the North Koreans tend to follow up their effective walkout with a provocative act such as a missile test. In the case of the February 29 agreement, however, the negotiations had hardly broken down. By all accounts the atmosphere was good. The process was very much on track, and -- dare one use a word that should not be used in the context of North Korean negotiations -- there was optimism. Optimism that finally the momentum was being cranked up. Another far more spurious explanation has been to blame the victim, in this case, the United States. The idea is that the U.S. negotiators, having conducted months of painstaking preliminary work including with the Chinese and the South Koreans, somehow failed to nail down a clear pledge from the North Koreans, to the effect that a so-called space launch would be on the proscribed list. Obama warns against provocation . This farcical argument, prevalent among those who have convinced themselves that they would have been more competent than the U.S. negotiators, has been ""confirmed"" by the North Koreans themselves -- surprise, surprise -- who deny the launch was even mentioned in negotiations. Besides, the North Koreans view their space program as a kind of NASA of their own, and how could anyone think the launch was anything but their own contribution to the peaceful exploration of space? A far more likely explanation is that -- surprise, surprise -- North Korea did not have its act together. The people negotiating the food aid were not the same as those launching the missile. Presumably, the rift was civil-military, with the former more interested in feeding its people than the latter. One can imagine as well various conspiracy theories to explain the situation. After all, even dictatorships experience political struggles. With a free-for-all political scene, pitting the boy-dictator-wannabe, buttressed by his ambitious aunt and often antagonistic uncle, against a grouchy and arrogant military establishment, it could well be that the agreement was scuttled as part of an ongoing battle to settle personal rivalries. The standard of living in North Korea's upper aristocratic nomenclature may not be much better than that of a Seoul taxi driver, but it's state power that counts, not just the supposed access to luxury goods. Some will say we have little choice but to wait and watch, and perhaps harvest the intelligence trove that may, so to speak, fall our way. Military solutions are least desirable, but so would be the prospect of a North Korean rocket falling on the soil of an ally, unopposed by an anti-missile system. We must protect our allies from a missile threat. Looking beyond the immediate crisis, we need a strategy that addresses any concerns that America's allies may have that our nuclear umbrella is not enough. We must continue to work closely with South Korea politically and diplomatically. We failed to do that in the early 2000s, with one consequence being that many South Koreans began regarding the North Koreans as our victims rather than one of the world's miscreants. We have worked closely with China, but perhaps it is time for that ambitious nation, so preoccupied by its internal affairs of late, to step it up and start attaching some sense of urgency to addressing the problems caused by its support for a country that would not last a week without it. Above all, we need to remain patient and calm with the resolve to understand that we cannot walk away from the problem. We need to work with others and strengthen the regional partnerships we have -- and will need -- if the North Korean problem is ever to be solved.

"(CNN) -- Journalism is not as black and white as most people would like to believe. We ought to be able to see all shades of grey between the fresh revelations of email hacking by a Sky News reporter, the News International phone hacking scandal and other examples of journalists breaking the law to obtain stories. The Guardian revealed last week that Sky News reporter Gerard Tubb illegally accessed emails from the personal account of John Darwin, also known as ""canoe man"", who, in 2007, pleaded guilty to faking his own death. Darwin's wife, Anne, was due to stand trial for deception in 2008, but the reporter had collected a sufficient amount of emails, he believed, to crush her defense at trial. The hacking was authorized by Simon Cole, managing editor of Sky News, who stepped down from his position on the same day the Guardian story was published. Emails were given to Cleveland police, used in the successful prosecution and, according to Sky News, ""pivotal to the case"". Cole has since then tweeted he had been planning to retire for ""some time"" and the decision was unrelated to the hacking revelations. Sky News claimed the interception of emails was ""justified and in the public interest"" and ""subject to the proper editorial controls"". Those are the two key aspects that seem to separate this instance from two others: the phone hacking scandal and the outing of the Night Jack blogger by The Times. Richard Horton, a detective constable at Lancashire police, won the Orwell Prize in 2009 for his anonymous blog Night Jack, about life in the police force. His identity was then exposed against his wishes by reporter Patrick Foster, from The Times. The discovery of his identity was revealed in February this year to have been made via the hacking of his email account. Unlike the outing of Horton, the hacking carried out by Sky News seems to have been a carefully considered decision by a senior executive as to whether it was in the public interest to commit a prima facie breach of the Computer Misuse Act. It was most likely a calculated risk, taken with the understanding that the Act itself offers no public interest defense and that both Sky News and the reporter would be liable to criminal charges and subject to the discretion of the Crown Prosecution Service not to prosecute. In the Night Jack case, a reporter made the decision to intercept Horton's emails without telling his editors and therefore without subjecting his decision to ""proper editorial controls"". If the Computer Misuse Act did offer such defense, the public interest in obtaining information via interception of emails would still have to be weighed by the courts. But Sky News, for instance, would have been able to explain to the public more confidently, from the outset, how the story came to light. I would say this is what we want from journalism -- transparency, responsibility and governance. This may seem a paradox, but that's what we want from newspapers and journalists even when they break the law. And despite having indisputably broken the law, the process Sky News seems to have undergone to break this story is a far cry from the industrial-scale criminality carried out and admitted to by News International. What we have found out so far about phone hacking is that during a period of at least two years, hundreds of individuals had their details collected by a private investigator at the request of journalists. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers, head of Operation Weeting - the police investigation into phone hacking - told the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the British press, that 581 ""likely"" victims of phone hacking were contacted by police; 231 were uncontactable and 17 were not contacted for operational reasons. Subsequent to having their details collected, those individuals had their voicemail messages intercepted, listened to and used for an array of stories no one has been able to prove as yet were in the public interest. In fact, the majority of cases we have seen so far, if not all, involved obtaining information to write and publish stories about people's private lives with no good, justifiable reason. There is a fundamental difference between using a private investigator at any given time to turn around a story on tittle-tattle, or to fish for stories and monitor people's lives, and to make a careful, considered decision to carry out a breach of the law in order to expose wrongdoing. No one here is advocating a free for all or trying to make it easier for journalists to act like criminals. But if journalists can speak openly about the sourcing of stories, then everybody wins. Accountability is increased, journalists feel more confident to be transparent about their actions and to pursue genuine stories, and sheer criminality can be more easily identified. In my view, the Computer Misuse Act, Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, Official Secrets Act (mainly for protection of sources), should all provide a public interest defense for the protection of journalists and real journalism. The Reynolds defense for libel, which is always tested in court, should also be improved. Martin Moore, director of the Media Standards Trust, and Brian Cathcart, Professor of Journalism at Kingston University, decided to launch the Hacked Off campaign because it was becoming increasingly clear that phone hacking carried out by the News of The World was more widespread than News International and the Metropolitan Police cared to let us know. The campaign, supported by actors Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, and several other victims of phone hacking and other abuses by the press, pushed and continues to push for criminality to be exposed, but we have always made absolutely clear that genuine, responsible journalism, carried out in the best interest of the public, should be protected. We will, however, continue to condemn fishing expeditions and industrial scale data-mining and hacking, which are clearly criminal and unjustifiable.","British journalist argues for public interest defense in some cases of hacking .

"(CNN) -- In February 2009, President Barack Obama gave this stern warning to bailed-out banks: . ""You are not going to be able to give out these big bonuses until you've paid taxpayers back,"" Obama said at a town hall meeting. ""You can't get corporate jets, you can't go take a trip to Las Vegas or go down to the Super Bowl on the taxpayers' dime."" He should have added: ""... unless you work for the federal government."" Twenty months later, as we all now know, a government agency called the General Services Administration rolled into Vegas on $822,000 worth of taxpayers' dimes so that 300 federal employees could enjoy a luxury spa, a clown show and a mind-reader, among other ""over the top"" entertainments at a regional training conference. The revelation, unearthed by an internal inspector general, has resulted in two senior-level firings and the resignation of GSA chief Martha Johnson, while triggering the usual amount of political japery in Washington. But it's worth lingering on the contrast between this incident and Obama's original bank target. The bailed-out bank that had been planning to send its most valuable employees to Vegas -- as it had been doing for years -- was Wells Fargo. One fact largely overlooked in the national shaming campaign that proved effective enough to derail the trip was that Wells Fargo didn't want the bailout. Or at least said it didn't when then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson summoned the nation's top nine private bankers to Washington on October 13, 2008. Here's how Time magazine described the scene: ""[T]he nine bank bosses, assembled in the Treasury's imposing boardroom, were each handed a piece of paper with the terms: $25 billion of preferred shares each from Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America. In return for the capital, the U.S. would collect a 5% dividend in the first five years. Although Wells Fargo chairman Richard Kovacevich resisted, Paulson gave the bankers no choice."" Newsweek's Michael Hirsh put it even more explicitly, and presciently: ""Richard Kovacevich had a point. Why should his company, Wells Fargo, sign its freedom (and his compensation) away to the U.S. Treasury when, unlike many other banks, it hadn't overloaded itself with risky, mortgage-backed securities? The Wells Fargo chairman eventually agreed Monday to Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's capital injection plan -- it was, frankly, an offer he couldn't refuse -- but Kovacevich's objections still resonate. Amid the continuing market turmoil, there is a sense that all of us are being asked to assume collective guilt for the large, but still identifiable, group of rogues and villains who got us into this mess. And then we're supposed to just forget about it."" A funny thing about collective shame -- we are happy to administer it on CEOs who get their arms twisted by the feds, yet we shy away from applying it to one of the only truly collective entities we have: taxpayer-funded government. We love to bash Goldman Sachs for trading exotic mortgage-backed derivatives, but we are far less likely to even point out that the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were trailblazers on the derivatives-trading fronts. It shouldn't be surprising in this climate that federal employees would assume they get to play under different ethical rules and public scrutiny than fat-cat bankers. After all, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said last month that discretionary spending has been cut ""to the limit,"" and Obama just this week thundered that the House GOP's recently proposed budget -- which, by the way, increases spending from $3.5 trillion to $4.9 trillion over the next decade -- amounts to ""social Darwinism"" that deliberately guts the middle class. And let's not forget what the GSA does: As The New York Times puts it, the agency is ""essentially the government's personal shopper for big-ticket items, like buying and leasing buildings and cars."" These are precisely the people tasked with making sure taxpayer dollars are spent most wisely. We have a federal government on autopilot, borrowing 40 cents on every dollar, after a decade-plus bipartisan spending binge that has doubled the budget in nominal terms. Washington is a boomtown, gentrifying rapidly as the rest of the country eagerly awaits the appearance of green shoots. The surprise isn't that a federal agency went wild, or even that it got caught. What remains a genuine stumper is that the rest of the country hasn't quite figured out that the real Sin City has relocated 2,500 miles east.

"(CNN) -- Nearly one out of every five NATO soldiers killed in Afghanistan this year were killed by Afghan police or army forces. Nine of the 16 victims were U.S. soldiers. This pattern of attacks raises a fundamental problem for the plans of the United States and other NATO countries to draw down their forces over the next two years. That plan is, in part, predicated on the idea that as Afghan forces take the lead in security operations, they will be supported by small numbers of U.S./NATO advisers embedded in Afghan army and police units. Those advisers will be quite vulnerable to attack. This problem was underlined earlier this week when an Afghan Local Police (ALP) officer on Monday shot and killed a U.S. soldier in the eastern province of Paktika, and the same day an Afghan soldier murdered two British soldiers at a NATO base in Lashkar Gah, the capital city of Helmand Province. Monday's shootings were the latest in a wave of attacks on international troops by Afghan security forces, prompting concerns over the stepped up frequency of what NATO terms ""green-on-blue"" incidents. Incidents of green-on-blue violence were rare in the first few years of the Afghan War, averaging no more than one a year through 2008. With the ""surge"" of 33,000 U.S. troops in 2009, though, the number of attacks jumped to 4, likely due to the increased exposure of Afghan forces to international troops. Instead of tapering off, this upward trend continued to a peak of 12 incidents in 2011. And there have already been nine such attacks this year. In January, an Afghan soldier fired on a group of French troops during a training exercise, killing four and wounding 16. The deadly attack prompted French President Nicolas Sarkozy to temporarily suspend French training programs in Afghanistan and threaten the early withdrawal of French troops. NATO officials usually characterize these incidents as ""isolated,"" and not indicative of the overall relationship between coalition forces and their Afghan partners. But the trust that might have once existed between international forces and their Afghan counterparts has been seriously undermined by three recent incidents. -- In January a video surfaced on YouTube showing U.S. Marines urinating on the bodies of suspected Taliban insurgents. -- This month U.S. Staff Sgt. Robert Bales was accused of going on a murderous rampage a mile from his base in Kandahar, killing 16 Afghan civilians. -- The accidental burning of Qurans by U.S. soldiers at Bagram Airfield on February 21 sparked massive protests across Afghanistan. During one such protest outside a military base in Nangarhar Province, a man wearing an Afghan army uniform turned his gun on NATO troops, killing two U.S. servicemen. Two days later, Afghans wearing police uniforms shot and killed two U.S. officers in one of the most secure areas of the Interior Ministry. The Taliban quickly claimed responsibility for the murders inside the Interior Ministry, saying they were in retaliation for the Quran burnings. However, the insurgent group's involvement in planning most of the green-on-blue attacks is doubtful. A few perpetrators have found safe-haven with the Taliban following their attacks, such as the Afghan army soldier, Mohammed Roozi, who appeared in a Taliban video in February boasting about his attack on Australian troops, but rarely have the Taliban declared that the Afghan soldiers and police who have turned their guns on U.S. and NATO troops were working for them. With American forces making up almost 70% of the NATO troops on the ground in Afghanistan, it is not surprising that almost half of the attacks involved the death or injury of U.S. troops, but as the bar chart on the left shows, many other NATO countries have also been the target of insider attacks by Afghan security forces. Sixteen British soldiers, for instance, have been killed in such attacks. NATO's withdrawal strategy requires a high degree of trust between small numbers of military advisors embedded with much larger units of Afghan troops in order to succeed. This trust has now been eroded to a dangerous degree. Does NATO have a Plan B?","Peter Bergen: NATO troops falling victim to shooting by Afghan forces .

"(CNN) -- As always, Mobile World Congress, the world's largest mobile telephone extravaganza, is being held in Barcelona this year. But it really should be held in Geneva, close to where Mary Shelley created Frankenstein. That's because, with our increasing addiction to our mobile phones, we are in danger of creating a monster that we are less and less able to control. Exaggeration? When was the last time you went out without your smartphone? How naked, how lost, do you feel without your mobile device? How much essential data, I mean really personal stuff that you wouldn't want anyone else to see, does your mobile phone contain? Expect all the noise this week in Barcelona to be about more powerful phones from Nokia, HTC, Samsung and LG. These hardware companies will articulate the benefits of their technology in terms of ""personal empowerment."" But the real truth behind these increasingly intelligent devices is personal disempowerment. Such is the eerie reality of a phone that you can't live without. Read more: Full coverage of Mobile World Congress . Some of the problems with our cellphones are already well known. Last November, for example, the American epidemiologist and writer Dr Devra Davis told me about her research claiming that our cellphones could be giving us cancer. Then there was Robert Vamosi, the security expert, who explained to me how our mobile gadgets were spying on us. Vamosi even authored a book last year about this, entitled ""How Our Technologies Betray Us: The Dark Side of Our Infatuation With New Technologies."" Vamosi isn't exaggerating about this dark side. There's an entire ecosystem developing around our mobile devices designed to spy on us. The Wall Street Journal ran a chilling series entitled ""What They Know"" which revealed how our Apple iPhones and Google Android devices were watching our every move. The surveillance and the mobile phone industries, The Journal indicated, are becoming ever more indistinguishable. Every day now seems to reveal a new mobile data scandal. Only this week, for example, it was reported that Facebook, Flickr and other app makers were reading our text messages without our permission. The real problem with these phones is their increasing intelligence. Just as Google is designing the self-driving car, so tomorrow's cell phone will become more and more all-knowing. By 2015 not only will there by seven billion mobile devices in the world, but they will -- empowered by artificial intelligence features like Apple's Siri personal assistant and Evi, its new British competitor -- become more and more indistinguishable from the human brain. ""What we're talking about is a complete physical interface to the digital and virtual worlds,"" the futurist Richard Hammond told CNN. ""So we need to bring more brains onto the device,"" Hammond explained, ""so we can provide more relevant information when needed ... based on artificial intelligence. Because that's the kind of technology that brings the device closer our own reasoning capabilities."" But do any of us really want our cell phones to have our ""reasoning capabilities?"" Do we want to create mobile devices in our own image? No, we don't, I suspect. Especially since, as mobile ad industry experts acknowledged to CNN, this will involve the creepiest kind of compromises, allowing them to eavesdrop and record every aspect of the lives we reveal to the world through our mobile devices. At one point, I wonder, do increasingly intelligent and autonomous cell phones incorporate such sophisticated intelligence that they become indistinguishable from us? At what point will we find ourselves in a world described by the Russian-American satirist Gary Shteyngart in ""Super Sad True Love Story"" where everyone carries a mobile device called an ""apparat"" that is able to identify the most intimate details of a stranger's life? Meanwhile, my earlier Frankenstein allusion is already being used by writers to describe our digital future. The best-selling writer, Robert Harris, did indeed base ""The Fear Index"" his latest thriller in Geneva, the scene of Shelley's Frankenstein. But whereas Harris imagines a world of massive computers acquiring human reasoning, a much scarier scenario is one in which this algorithmic power has been so miniaturized that it can be put inside our mobile devices. Hammond even suggests that this intelligence will become so indistinguishable from us that it will actually become part of us -- fashionable spectacles will provide visual displays, earring studs the audio and a third device will touch input. He then warns us about a future in which virtual reality will become so mobile that we will be able to wear it under our skin. So what to do? How can we stop our phones becoming Frankenstein-like extensions of ourselves? Yes, there is a need for legislation fighting our snooping mobile devices. I'm in favor, for example, of U.S. President Barack Obama's privacy bill of rights, and particularly his ""Do Not Track"" legislation which he unveiled last week. And I applaud the work of legislators like EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding and Minnesota Congressman Al Franken who are aggressively looking into the information-collecting practices of Google, Apple and the other big data companies in the mobile ecosystem. But the growing omniscience of our mobile devices isn't just a political issue. ""Practice safe phone"" to combat their cancerous impact, Dr Devra Davis advises. But practicing safe phone extends to untangling ourselves from our mobile devices. It means fighting their growing power over us. It means reminding them who is boss. Above all, we need to stop fetishizing cellphones. More than 60,000 people are expected to attend the Mobile World Congress this week to gaze at new phones. But remember: All the coercively seductive new products unveiled in Barcelona in the next few days are just phones. They can't make us younger, richer, more virile or more intelligent. And they certainly don't empower us. The real sense of empowerment comes from (re)establishing our mastery over our mobile devices. As William Powers, the author of the excellent ""Hamlet's BlackBerry"" argues, what this means is disconnecting ourselves from our mobile devices once a week. What it means is pressing the off button so that our smartphone can never become as smart as we are. â€¢ Follow @ajkeen on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- In what must be the most extraordinary statement of his presidency, Barack Obama on Monday blasted the possibility that the United States Supreme Court might overturn the Affordable Care Act. Obama said the court would take an ""unprecedented, extraordinary step"" if it overturns the law, because it was passed by ""a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress."" Setting aside the point that the ACA did not pass with an overwhelming majority, but by a party-line vote in the Senate and seven votes in the House, and without the support of a single member of the Republican Party, the most astonishing thing about Obama's diatribe was the fundamental misunderstanding of our constitutional tradition it revealed. Since 1788, in the famous defense of the Constitution set forth by Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, it has been understood that it is the task of the Supreme Court to rein in majoritarian legislatures when they go beyond what the Constitution permits. This is not, as Obama implies, judicial activism, or political activity on the part of the justices. This is simply, as Hamilton explained, fidelity to the Constitution itself, fidelity to the highest expression of ""We the People of the United States,"" the body whose representatives ratified that Constitution. That doctrine of judicial review was most famously expressed by the great Chief Justice John Marshall in Marbury v. Madison (1803), but it had been noted not only by Hamilton, but by many other federal judges in the late 18th century. And over the years, in more than 50 instances, courts have struck down unconstitutional behavior by the federal and state legislatures. Judicial review is not usurpation -- it is the manner in which the rule of law is preserved in this nation. It is certainly true that sometimes courts, and even the Supreme Court, have erred in their interpretation of the Constitution, and some legislative acts that clearly were permitted by the Constitution have been struck down. But if the ACA's individual mandate is rejected, this will be fully within the legitimate exercise of judicial powers. Opinion: Supreme Court is playing with fire . This is because, as was made clear in the recent arguments in the court, that mandate, for the very first time in history, is an attempt to compel virtually every adult American to participate in commerce. It is not an attempt to regulate commerce -- which the Constitution permits -- but is, instead, an attempt to create and compel commerce, which the Constitution does not authorize. The Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, a measure regarded as fundamental by those who argued for the passage of the Bill of Rights in 1791, provides that the powers not granted to the federal government are reserved to the states and the people thereof. As the Supreme Court told us in the Lopez (1995) and Morrison (2000) cases, this means that there must be some limits on the powers of the federal government, and it also means that the basic law-making power, the police power, must reside in the governments closest to the people themselves, the state and local governments. This is our tradition, and the ACA's individual mandate is a fundamental break with that tradition. If, as it should, the Supreme Court declares the individual mandate unconstitutional, it will be reaffirming our traditions, and not usurping them. The president, a former constitutional law teacher, should be ashamed of himself. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen B. Presser.","President said top court would break with precedent if it overturns the health care law .

"(CNN) -- No one will know until June how the Supreme Court will rule on President Obama's Affordable Care Act. What we do know is there are three possible outcomes -- the law is upheld, struck down or struck down in part -- and Republicans must be prepared for each. If the law, also known as ""ObamaCare,"" is struck down -- in whole or in part -- and the GOP is not prepared, it could find itself on the losing end of a vicious battle that could lead to four more years of Democratic control of the White House and perhaps Congress as well. On Monday, the president for the first time commented publicly on the Supreme Court's deliberations. He warned the court about ""judicial activism"" and ""a lack of judicial restraint"" -- something Republicans have said they abhor. And he cautioned the ""unelected group of people"" -- the justices on the court -- against ""overturn[ing] a duly constituted and passed law."" He walked back those comments after critics, including even liberal columnist Ruth Marcus, took issue with them. But the message was clear. The president may say he is confident the court will uphold the law, but it seems he's not entirely optimistic. And if the law is overturned, we can count on the president to raise the issue on the campaign trail. It's a reasonable strategy. Plus, ""relitigating"" the court decision would be better for him than to run on issues such as unemployment rate, the state of the economy or the price of gas, which he hasn't handled well. That leaves the Supreme Court. Although it may be hard to rouse conservatives to action right now since they don't know how the court will rule, it's better to be ready than not. If the law is overturned, they will need to come up with a comprehensive alternative. They can take some time to hash out the details by engaging the public on the issue. They can start by telling voters, in the words of the Cato scholar Doug Bandow, that ""ObamaCare represents extraordinary federal overreach, a bid to legislate well beyond Congress' constitutional powers."" Republicans should offer a free-market approach that ends tax-favored treatment of workplace coverage; encourages competition, even across state lines; promotes consumer choice; and somehow addresses those with pre-existing conditions. In many ways, it would mirror portions of what Mitt Romney began to outline in a recent USA Today op-ed. The Republican plan should seek to repair what is wrong with the health care law but deal respectfully with popular provisions, such as the one that allows young adults to stay on their parents' plans into their mid-20s. They also must force insurance companies to explain why they are hesitant to provide coverage for those with pre-existing conditions without an individual mandate. Voters will want to hear something from Republicans that indicates they know, care and want to deal with this problem. For most Americans, health care is like plumbing: They know they need it; they don't truly know how it works, but they definitely know when it's not working. And they sense now health care is not working, and the health care law -- flawed though it may be -- represents a legitimate attempt to fix it. There is no doubt health care will remain a highly volatile issue in this election year. If ObamaCare is rejected by the court, it would present a huge opportunity for Republicans. They could look like problem-solvers by coming up with a smart proposal that takes the best ideas from the other side. And if they can message it properly, they'll be in a sweet spot.

"(CNN) -- Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's victory in Myanmar's by-elections on Sunday represents the nascent return of opposition politics to the country after nearly half a century of military rule. It also has created an opportunity for the United States to begin easing economic sanctions that are hindering reform. Aung San Suu Kyi, kept under house arrest by the government for 15 years, won a seat in the parliament with a handy plurality. Votes continue to be tallied, but reports indicate that her National League for Democracy (NLD) party captured most of the 45 seats up for grabs. The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) will maintain its grip on the majority of the 662 seats in the Union Parliament, but now opposition members will have a voice in lawmaking. The international community should take this moment to encourage Myanmar's moves toward liberalization. For the United States, the time has come to seriously address its myriad financial sanctions on Myanmar to ensure that they are not working at cross-purposes with reform efforts. The reformers in Myanmar believe that popular support for the political transition can be consolidated only if real improvements in the quality of life can be delivered to the country's poverty-struck masses and struggling middle class. They fear that if the country's economic decline is not arrested and reversed relatively soon, it will lead to widespread dissatisfaction and instability, threatening a return to harsh security measures. The draconian application of U.S. financial sanctions is having a serious negative impact on legitimate economic actors in Myanmar who are struggling to institute positive changes. They are also impeding Americans who are working to assist in the reforms. While those aspects of the financial sanctions aimed at inhibiting corrupt economic activity should be retained, they should be modified to ensure that they do not prevent legitimate financial transactions essential to the development of a vibrant private sector, that they allow wider assistance for capacity building which Myanmar so urgently needs, and that they contribute positively to the transformation of the country's banking and financial system. Gradually easing the trade sanctions could help develop certain sectors of the economy as they begin to expand. Investment sanctions should also be reduced as the macroeconomic structures are reformed and anticorruption measures are put in place. The complex web of U.S. sanctions targeted at Myanmar over the past 20 years includes five federal laws and four presidential executive orders, all of which require different conditions to be met for lifting. Throughout the sanctions-building process, very little thought was given to how to unpack them if and when it was warranted. By necessity, this will be a gradual process, enabling the United States to continue to test the commitment of President Thein Sein's government to pursuing democratic reforms, halting conflict in ethnic areas and seeking a genuine political settlement and expanding individual freedoms and civic activity. Some of Myanmar's new leaders are trying to move decisively in the direction of democracy, free enterprise, and the protection of human rights, which the United States has been advocating for decades. To insist on solutions to all of the country's problems before sanctions can be relieved at all would be self-defeating. A more reliable measure of progress than the by-elections will come in 2015, when Myanmar plans to hold its next general elections. By this time, the civilian population should have a better idea of whether the government is making sincere efforts to serve the public interest, whether it is safe to run for office and engage openly in political activity, and whether a new generation of socially responsible political and military leaders is emerging. The United States should do all it can to help Myanmar get to this point.

"(CNN) -- For 35 years, the Cato Institute has been a nonpartisan and independent source of libertarian views on key policy issues in America. We stand for limited government, individual liberty and peace. No matter who is in the White House or has control of Congress, scholars at Cato have consistently argued that the federal government should treat every person as an individual, regardless of background and lifestyle choices. We have advocated for limiting military engagement in foreign conflicts that have no bearing on the safety of our country. And we have opposed legislation that would involve more government control, even when that legislation is supported by some free-market organizations. Over the years, these beliefs have put us at odds with elected officials on all sides of the political spectrum. We have been critical of Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama for what we believe to be overreaching of executive authority. We were among the first to question the Bush administration's war in Iraq, and we aggressively opposed President Obama's economic stimulus plan. However, we eagerly work with officials when we find areas of agreement, as we did with the Clinton administration on trade policies and the Bush administration on Social Security reform. But, if Charles Koch, the CEO of Koch Industries, gets his way, the independence that has allowed Cato scholars to focus on smart policies rather than electoral politics will come to an end. Koch, along with current CEO Ed Crane, was a co-founder of Cato and provided nearly all of the seed capital and early funding that established the institute in 1977. Koch's interests have taken him on different paths since; he left Cato's board in 1991 and has provided no funding to the institute for many years. Opinion: Koch believes in an independent Cato . Koch has recently increased his funding for more partisan advocacy groups, such as the Americans for Prosperity. His brother, David, told me in a meeting in November of 2011 that he and Charles wanted Cato to coordinate more closely with their political organizations in their efforts to defeat President Obama in the fall election. Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, left little doubt as to what their plans are when he spoke with the New York Times that same month: ""From an operational standpoint, we're going to have a field effort in targeted states that is doing phones, door to door, and integrated with direct mail and social media. It is going to look very similar to what party committees would be doing."" That's fine for them, but not for Cato. The court will ultimately decide who is in control at Cato: A board of independent directors who have, over 30 years, provided financial and management support to the institute while upholding its libertarian principles, or two individuals who seek to restructure the board with people beholden to their political agendas. The Koch brothers are shareholders of Cato through an unusual but legal arrangement. Because one of the shareholders passed away, the Kochs believe they can take control of Cato. Indeed, Charles Koch's first step when he thought he had gained control of Cato's stock was to nominate 12 people to fill board seats of Cato directors whose terms of service had expired. None of the nominees had supported Cato financially or indicated any interest in the institute's governance. Three nominees are Koch employees, two are lawyers for Koch Industries, two had long careers at Koch-controlled organizations, one is a third-generation major shareholder in Koch Industries and one is a Republican political operative. However accomplished the nominees may be, they are not appropriate for Cato's board if the institute is to preserve its international reputation as a leading vanguard for libertarian principles. The stakes are high. Would transforming Cato from a libertarian research center into a policy shop for the Kochs' political operations make any sense? The answer from Cato's fiercely independent donors, scholars and stakeholders worldwide has been unequivocal: No. As partisan wrangling threatens to polarize Washington to the point of paralysis, there should be at least one organization to which elected leaders and the public can turn for credible, consistent, free-market policy prescriptions. Any imagined benefits from a takeover of Cato will be more than offset by the flight of its greatest assets -- its scholars. Similarly, any attempt to direct or influence Cato initiatives will result in quick devaluation of the Cato brand. This would be devastating -- not just for Cato, but for the libertarian movement that Koch conspicuously supports. The Kochs can easily work through their activist grassroots organizations to advance their political goals. But the Cato Institute cannot be just another tool to promote their interests. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert A. Levy.","Cato Institute has been an independent source of libertarian views for 35 years .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The final runoff of Egypt's first free elections in recent memory has ended and the result is clear: Islamist parties have swept the popular vote. Should the international community worry? In every Arab country where popular uprisings have pushed dictators out of power, Islamist parties have become the most powerful political force. That has caused anxiety among progressive Arabs and a great deal of confusion in the West. After all, the uprisings that were optimistically labeled the ""Arab Spring"" were supposed to herald a blossoming of freedom, democracy and equality. Do Islamist parties believe in freedom, democracy and equality? If you ask them, you will hear a symphony of reassurances and contradictions, punctuated by an occasionally jarring declaration, as when Egypt's Salafi Nour Party proclaimed that ""democracy is heresy."" If there were a surprise in Egypt's parliamentary elections, it was the strong showing of the ultraconservative Salafis, who would like to turn the social clock back by several centuries and return to the rules that governed Muslim lands in the days of the Prophet Muhammad, about 1300 years ago. The Salafists have proposed banning women and Christians from holding office, ending alcohol sales and cutting off the hands of thieves. They call Christians and Jews ""infidels."" The other electoral surprise, in Egypt and elsewhere in the Arab world, is just how badly liberal groups -- the ones who launched the uprisings and embrace the kind of democracy we would recognize in the West -- fared at the polls. The Freedom and Justice Party of the Muslim Brotherhood came on top in Egypt's latest election, taking about 40% of the vote. The Salafis came in second with about 25%. This means that Islamist parties captured a whopping two-thirds of the vote. The winners will form Egypt's first democratically-elected parliament, which will choose the people who write the country's new constitution. The Salafis' extreme views have helped the Brotherhood look moderate, which is exactly the image they want to project to the West. Leaders of parties affiliated with or inspired by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood who have won elections in Tunisia and even in Morocco, where King Mohamed VI allowed elections to prevent an uprising, say they support democratic principles. When speaking to the Western media, they have especially tried to send out a reassuring message. But occasionally they have slipped up. In fact, the Muslim Brotherhood is still trying to sort out where it stands on many issues. A case in point is the peace treaty with Israel. The group has said it has no intention of revoking the treaty. But a few days ago, the deputy leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Rashad Bayumi, told the newspaper Al Hayat that the Brotherhood would never recognize Israel, is not committed to the peace treaty and would take steps to change it. At the moment, liberal Egyptian activists are more focused on how to wrest power from the military. But, assuming that battle succeeds, their attention will turn to what an Islamist government would mean. Both the Salafis and the Brotherhood acknowledge plans to impose Sharia, the traditional Islamic law. The difference is that Salafis want to do it immediately. The Muslim Brotherhood, which has learned patience during decades of operating underground, says it will bring it back gradually, over many years. It wasn't very long ago the Muslim Brotherhood declared it would not allow a Christian to become president. About 10% of Egyptians are Coptic Christians, who have endured brutal attacks since the uprising that ended the dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak. But the Muslim Brotherhood has been steadily toning down its rhetoric. Throughout the region, the long-time leaders of Islamist organizations, which had been banned by regimes often supported by the U.S. and its European allies, are emerging as powerful politicians trying to convince the rest of the world to trust them. Countries like Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco, all need Western tourists and their hard currency. The last thing they want is to spook investors and worsen their already dire economies. In the West, some are convinced that this turn of events spells disaster. They don't believe the Islamists' claims to moderation and think they are biding their time and will eventually show their true, radical colors. After all, the Muslim Brotherhood has deep extremist roots. One of the major figures in the organization's history, Sayid Qutb, had a passionate hatred of the U.S. and the West. His views on the Jews fed the worst anti-Semitic conspiracy theories among his followers. It's hard to imagine all of this has suddenly evaporated. And yet, the Brotherhood also has a strong pragmatic streak. While it is true that it provided the ideological fuel for al Qaeda and for the Gama'a al-Islamiya and Islamic Jihad -- the group that assassinated Egyptian President Anwar Sadat as punishment for making peace with Israel -- it is also true that these terrorist groups emerged after the Muslim Brotherhood renounced violence. So, what do Islamists really hope to accomplish? Washington doesn't need to wait for an answer to that question before it starts responding to this uncertain situation. In fact, it can already start helping to shape the future of the Arab world by strongly promoting the ideals it supports. The Egyptian people have not studied democracy the way Americans or Europeans have. President Obama and his counterparts in other liberal democracies should help explain the West's vision of democratic principles and tolerance. They should talk about how democracy does not just mean majority rule; it also means protection of minorities, equality for women and for people of all religions. It means rule of law and an independent judiciary. The West should make clear that those leaders who help preserve peace and build that vision of society in the emerging Arab democracies will have its support while those who don't will not have its backing.

"(CNN) -- Just as the Netscape IPO inaugurated the dotcom mania of the 90s, so Facebook's imminent IPO will trigger a hysteria with the social web. But the most interesting question isn't whether Facebook is actually worth $100 billion or how many billions of dollars Mark Zuckerberg will personally bank -- but whether or not Facebook really will make the world a better place for its close to a billion users. Zuckerberg certainly thinks it will. ""Facebook was not originally created to be a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission -- to make the world more open and connected,"" he wrote in a letter to shareholders that Facebook filed with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission yesterday. This social mission, Zuckerberg explained, has been designed to give people a voice, to change how society is organized and to bring us closer together as a species. Zuckerberg isn't alone in seeing Facebook as a major engine of historical progress that will ""build real value for the world"". As Larry Summers, the former U.S. treasury secretary, notes about the Facebook offering, it's ""an American milestone"" and Zuckerberg's company has the same historical significance as Ford or IBM. And just as Ford pioneered the mass-produced motor car and IBM helped develop the personal computer, so Facebook is (re)inventing the internet, transforming it from a solitary experience for anonymous individuals into a shared, social world. Reid Hoffman, the Silicon Valley super-connector who introduced Zuckerberg to his first investor, calls this new world ""Web 3.0,"" describing it as a place of ""real identities generating massive amounts of data."" That data is, of course, all the personal details about ourselves -- the billions of photos, updates and videos that we post narcissistically on our Facebook pages. That data is us. We -- you and I -- are the company's real product, the oil of our Web 3.0 age. Facebook aggregates and stores all our personal data and then sells access to it to advertisers. That is Facebook's creepy business model and it's why the seven-year-old company realized $3.71 billion of revenue in 2011. ""You've only got one identity,"" Zuckerberg once remarked with his typical naivety about the human condition. And, of course, he wants to own that identity, even going as far as to develop a product called Timeline which, quite literally, establishes an official narrative of our lives on his social network. Rather than being just another highly-trafficked website, Facebook's goal is become the operating system for the entire social web. Through its Social Graph technology, Facebook has introduced apps that allow us to tell our friends what movies we are watching, what books we are reading and what music we are listening to. As Time magazine explained when it made Zuckerberg its 2010 Person of the Year, his goal is to transform the internet into a well-lit dorm room in which ""wherever you go online, you'll see your friends."" And, of course, your friends -- not to mention your parents, employers, teachers and everyone else online -- will see you. They'll see you whatever you are doing and thinking and wherever you have been and will go. The impact of Facebook on our privacy is deeply worrying. I've argued that all this sharing is a trap, designed to tear open our lives. Many other people are now worrying about Facebook's cult of radical transparency and its willful disregard for privacy. Vivianne Reding, the European commissioner for justice, is even seeking to establish a ""right to forget"" law which makes you and I, rather than Facebook, the masters of our own personal data. Zuckerberg's strategy to promote his IPO is to present Facebook as a technology company that exists for the public good. ""There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future,"" he wrote in the SEC letter. But this is a fallacy. Facebook is a privately owned, for profit enterprise that exists for the benefit of its shareholders and employees. Connectivity benefits the company rather than us. Openness, we need to always remember, is a self-serving Silicon Valley ideology rather than a self-evident public good. So forget whether or not Facebook is really worth $75 or $100 billion. Ignore all the hocus-pocus about ""floats"" and how Wall Street bankers really value Facebook. The real value of Facebook lies in whether all this radical transparency will make the world a better place. Many think it will, arguing that Facebook and its ""internet of people"" will deepen our democracy and make the world a more open place. I doubt it will. The 1996 Netscape IPO led to the great stock market collapse of April 2000. But I fear that the 2012 Facebook IPO could lead to a much more human collapse. I worry about the disappearance of core values such as privacy, solitude and secrecy in our Web 3.0 world. So what's at stake here goes beyond economics. It gets to the very core of what it means to be human in our ubiquitously networked age. Drowning in a tsunami of sharing . Whether or not Facebook realizes its imperial dream of becoming the operating system of our Web 3.0 world, there's no doubt that social networks and social media companies are dramatically changing the internet's architecture and its economy. On Tuesday evening, I attended the Crunchies, Silicon Valley's annual Oscar-style award ceremony, which were held in San Francisco's appropriately transparent Davies Symphony Hall. And while Facebook failed to win any awards, its specter -- or, at least, the specter of social media -- hung heavily over the event. For better or worse, you see, everything and everyone inside Silicon Valley is going social. Indeed, given the visibility of social media companies at the awards, the Crunchies could have been renamed the Socials. Almost every award went to a social company or entrepreneur. Best New Start-up was won by the social pinboard network Pinterest. Founder of the year went to Twitter Chairman Jack Dorsey, while Twitter itself won the Biggest Social Impact award. The Angel Investor award went to Silicon Valley's most social investor, Reid Hoffman, and the winner of CEO of the Year award was LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner. The Facebook social game Words with Friends won the ""Best Time Sink"" award, and Best International Start-Up award went to the Brazilian social commerce Peixe Urbano. Google + was awarded the Best Social Application, the photography sharing site Fotopedia won Best Tablet Application, the social network Path 2.0 won Best Design award and the gay social network Grindr won Best Location Application. The legendary Kleiner-Perkins venture capitalist John Doerr described social as the third great wave of technological innovation, after the invention of the personal computer and the internet. Doerr's wave is about to engulf all of us. Are you ready to be drowned in an online tsunami of sharing? Introspection versus incessant updates . One response to all the self-promotional noise of the social web came this week from a most unexpected source. Susan Cain is the author of the new book ""Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking."" And ""Quiet,"" which is one of the hottest selling books in America right now and was featured as the Time cover story this week, is a reminder of the importance of introspection and solitude in our Facebook, Google+ and Twitter age of incessant updates, retweets, likes and pokes. Amidst all the hype of his IPO, I hope Zuckerberg has the opportunity to sit down and read the excellent ""Quiet."" It may inspire him to think more critically about his ""social mission"" and the real value of giving everyone a ""voice"" to talk about themselves. â€¢ Follow @ajkeen on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- Tibetans have long occupied a special place in the heart of the West. But that has not done them very much good. Over the past year, as the world focused on the Arab uprisings, and as China's growth shadowed over a weak global economy, the Tibetan struggle for autonomy entered a disturbing phase. From a distance, it might have looked as if China thoroughly succeeded in crushing Tibet's hope. But at home, in a western part of China, Tibetans are giving notice that their struggle is not over. Chinese authorities would do well to reconsider their strong-arm approach, because with or without Western attention, the Tibetans will continue their fight. It started in March of last year when a young Tibetan monk, Phuntsog, set himself on fire in a protest against China's policies. Since then, some 30 other Tibetans, mostly monks, have doused themselves with fuel and lit the spark that turned them into human torches, shouting cries for freedom and for the return of the Dalai Lama to his homeland, before collapsing and writhing in pain. Beijing has responded with crackdowns. But despite a large presence of security forces and some 21,000 Communist party officials, the self-immolations continue. Most of the cases have occurred in a remote area that allows Chinese authorities to easily block out foreign reporters. Exile groups say Tibetan protests occur daily. News about these occurrences has been sparse until this week, when the self-immolations crossed the Chinese borders into India. On Monday, 26-year-old Jamphel Yeshi set himself on fire before cameras in New Delhi during a demonstration to protest the visit of China's President Hu Jintao. The gasp-inducing photographs of Yeshi in flames stunned the world. On Wednesday, the Tibetan government in exile said that yet another monk set himself on fire. Lobsang Sherab died of his wounds. Chinese troops, according to Tibetan officials, took away his body despite his family's pleas. Beijing blames the horrific practice on the Dalai Lama, calling the self-immolations ""terrorism,"" even though the actions have no victims other than those who die at their own hand. In addition to trying to suppress Tibetan demands by brute force, as they have done for decades, Chinese officials have continued a propaganda campaign against the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, providing a version of events that leaps across the bounds of the credible. For years, Chinese officials have called the Dalai Lama ""a monster with a human face,"" and a ""wolf in a monk's robe."" Most recently, Beijing accused him of masterminding the gruesome protests. A government-run website accused the Dalai Lama of espousing ""Nazi racial policies,"" and single-handedly crafting the self-immolations as part of a campaign of racial segregation. China regularly refers to the aging monk as a ""splittist"" who aims to divide China to achieve Tibetan independence. In fact, the Dalai Lama long ago gave up his call for independence, instead pursuing a ""Middle Way,"" which seeks genuine autonomy within China, with freedom for Tibetans to preserve their culture and ensure their survival as an ethnic group. In addition, he has remained an ardent supporter of nonviolence, rejecting the campaign of self-immolations while offering prayers for those who died in the incidents. The Tibetan government in exile has also sharply decried the violent practice. From its base in Dharamsala, in northern India, it has stated that ""as Buddhists, life is precious,"" urging Tibetans to ""refrain from drastic actions."" But despite the Dalai Lama's position, Beijing refuses to hold talks and continues to flood Tibetan areas with Han Chinese, diluting the local population and limiting Tibetan monastic practices. The Dalai Lama, who has achieved rock star status in much of the world, has done much to rally the West to his cause. But his effort only goes so far. Given China's increasing economic clout, even President Obama tried to avoid upsetting the Chinese government on the Tibet issue. When the Dalai Lama visited the president in 2010, he had to leave the White House through a back door -- in front of garbage bags -- to lower the profile of the visit. The president later met him more openly in the face of criticism. China has the upper hand now, but it would do well to reassess its view of the Tibetan leader. It may hope that after his death, the Tibetan movement will lose strength. But the wave of immolations indicates that the opposite may happen. Tibetans are getting impatient with the Dalai Lama's nonviolent approach. After all, China has shown no signs of easing repression for those living under its rule. The Chinese have said that they want stability, but its misguided policies on Tibet only create conditions for more instability. If China doesn't step up, then the West must help Tibetans make the point that an end to repression is the fastest road to stability. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Since March 2011, 30 Tibetans have set themselves on fire in protest of China .

"Wathinkha, Myanmar (CNN) -- Opposition leader and Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi won a seat in Myanmar's parliament Sunday, her party said, a momentous victory following a decades-long fight for democracy. Staff from Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, said she won and that several hundred people were waiting at NLD headquarters to celebrate the news, party spokesman Nyan Win said. The chairman of the Yangon region of the election commission, Ko Ko, said official results may be known by Monday morning. The formerly banned National League for Democracy was vying for 45 seats in the election. While the balance of power in the parliament will not change even if the opposition were to win all 45, the vote itself marks a symbolic victory for many in the country who have lived under military rule for 50 years. Suu Kyi, 66, won by a landslide the last time Myanmar held multiparty elections, in 1990, but the junta ignored the results and placed her under house arrest. Released in November 2010, Suu Kyi was allowed to crisscross the country to rally support for the NLD for Sunday's race. The NLD fielded a candidate for every seat, with Suu Kyi representing Kawhmu, south of the former capital city of Yangon. She ran against a former military doctor. The government promised the vote would be free and fair and allowed international observers to monitor the polling. Analysts said the sheer number and spread of polling booths across the country would make it impossible for international monitors to ensure an honest count. Ahead of the election, Suu Kyi alleged there had been voting irregularities, illegal activities and intimidation either committed or encouraged by official entities. Sunday, Win, the NLD spokesman, said the party had received more than 50 reports of voting irregularities. In one area, ballot sheets had wax placed over the check box for the NLD, making it easier to erase the mark later and annul the vote, he said. In another area, ballots were found that had already been filled out, he said. Election Comission Chairman Tin Aye said he hoped the elections were fair but couldn't speak to the allegations of irregularities. ""It's too soon to say,"" he said. Still, Suu Kyi hoped her party would win as many parliamentary seats as possible. Myanmar's legislature has 664 seats, more than 80% of which are still held by lawmakers aligned with the military-backed ruling party, Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). The 45 seats under contention are vacancies created by the promotion of parliamentarians to the Cabinet and other posts last year. Still, the election is an opportunity for voters to weigh in during a time of enormous change in Myanmar, a country also known as Burma. Analysts said it would be the first real test of the government's commitment to transition from military rule. Two years ago, it staged a general election that was widely derided as a sham. Several former military leaders formed the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) at the time to contest the election. Suu Kyi's party boycotted it. After attracting international condemnation for manipulating the voting process in the 2010 race, Myanmar's leaders know that a fair election will be proof to the world that it can conduct a legitimate vote, experts said. ""It's hugely important and it will provide a new semi-democratic political system with an opportunity to show that it has ambition to become more transparent, more inclusive and thus more democratic,"" said Nicholas Farrelly, a research fellow at the Australian National University, about Sunday's race. In the past 12 months, the country pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, secured a cease-fire with Karen rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups. Freer press rules have encouraged the proliferation of journals and magazines. Myanmar's efforts to thaw its frosty relations with the rest of the world have been warmly welcomed and rewarded. In recent months, a steady procession of foreign ministers has visited the country and, in February, the European Union lifted a travel ban on Myanmar officials. There have been hints, too, that a free and fair vote on Sunday will lead to the relatively swift unraveling of sanctions that have long choked the country's economy. Thousands of Burmese living in exile around the world were watching the election for a clear sign that it is safe to return home. Young voters in Myanmar appeared to be particularly excited about the polling. Just the sight of Suu Kyi brazenly pitching her policies to huge crowds of people emboldened many to dare to believe that democracy might be possible. ""I am so happy and proud of voting freely,"" said Ung Sann, 30, on Sunday. ""I believe the government will change toward democracy."" Analysts said Suu Kyi is all but guaranteed to win her seat. ""It would be a major shock if she did not win her own seat. But I think we have to prepare people for the expectations that the NLD will not win all seats in the by-election,"" said Jim Della-Giacoma, a project director at International Crisis Group. Others said the number of seats won by the NLD is less critical than what the vote says about Myanmar's future. ""I don't think it matters how many seats the NLD wins. I think the only thing that really matters (is) whether it's free or fair. I don't think the people of Burma care about how many seats the NLD wins either. What they want to know is whether the next set of elections, the national elections (expected in 2015), are also going to be free and fair,"" said Monique Skidmore, of the University of Canberra. The daughter of Gen. Aung San, a hero of Burmese independence, Suu Kyi herself became an inspiration with her long struggle for democracy in the country. As a member of parliament, Suu Kyi would be expected to be free to travel outside Myanmar -- and more importantly to return -- something that wasn't possible during her long years of repression and confinement. She told hundreds of journalists gathered outside her residence Friday that she didn't plan to become a minister in the military-backed civilian government, if a position was offered to her. Under Myanmar's constitution, lawmakers can't hold ministerial office. Asked where she would place Myanmar's democracy on a scale of one to 10, Suu Kyi said, ""We're trying to get to one."" CNN's Paul Hancocks, Kocha Olarn and Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report.","NEW: A party spokesman says Suu Kyi has won .
The balance of power will not change even if the opposition wins all 45 seats .

"(CNN) -- A year ago, Bo Xilai was one of the most powerful and talked-about politicians in China. He was a member of China's ruling body, the Politburo, and he seemed to have a shot at gaining a seat on the key decision-making unit within it, the Standing Committee. But on March 15, he was removed from his post as the party secretary of Chongqing. Today, he's still one of the most-talked about men in China, not for how far he'll rise but for how far he's destined to fall. Charismatic and determined, Bo was primarily known for launching bold initiatives, such as encouraging the mass singing of ""red songs"" (revolutionary anthems from the days of Chairman Mao Zedong) and pushing for high-profile drives to rid his inland, south-central city of organized crime. The rise and fall of China's Bo Xilai . The circumstances surrounding Bo's fall are intriguing. Was it a power struggle or did he flout the law? In February, one of Bo's top lieutenants, whom he abruptly demoted, went to the U.S. consulate presumably to seek political asylum. Last week, the British government asked the Chinese government to investigate the mysterious death of a British businessman who claimed to have close ties to Bo's family. Despite this drama, Chinese leaders are hoping to minimize disturbances ahead of the major leadership transition of the Communist Party in the fall. So, what can we learn from this strange tale so far? 1. No matter how unified the leaders at the top of China's power structure seems, there are bound to be fissures. Factional divides might be linked to a number of factors, such as personal style, family history, regional identity or ideology. After the Tiananmen protests of 1989, China's leaders tried to show that factionalism was a thing of the past. But today, we know fissures may be hidden but can surface anytime. Bo Xilai and the politics of Chinese succession . Riding on his popularity before his fall, Bo took the step of trying to secure a seat on the Standing Committee by an unusual method. He seemed more like someone campaigning for votes rather than striving simply to get a nod of approval from the top Chinese leaders. In a country that has very limited democracy and only local elections, this seemed out of place. 2. Historical symbolism can be useful, but it can turn into political dynamite. Bo's rise was helped by his skill at playing to nostalgia for specific aspects of the Mao years. His promotion of old nationalist songs and presentation of himself as a fearless crusader against corruption and urban crime won him broad praise and support. But invoking the Maoist past proved to be a double-edged sword. The first clear indication that Bo was about to fall came when Premier Wen Jiabao gave a speech in March when he talked of the danger of any recurrence of ""Cultural Revolution"" patterns. To invoke the specter of the Cultural Revolution is always to conjure up images of destabilizing ""turmoil"" of a kind most Chinese would rather never see again. Bo's tactics made it all too easy for his political opponents to call him out. 3. Purges in China are unpredictable. It's hard to figure out what to call what has happened to Bo, who has been demoted but not detained and retains membership in the Politburo. He is definitely on the outs, so the term ""purge"" comes to mind, but the story is not finished. Consider Hua Guofeng, Mao's immediate successor, who was pushed aside after a few years by Deng Xiaoping, yet lived out his days as a minor official. Or Deng himself, who was in favor, out of favor and then back in favor as the leader of the Communist Party. At the other end of the spectrum is Zhao Ziyang, a chosen successor to Deng who was ousted for taking too lenient a stance toward the 1989 protests and remained under house arrest until his death. And powerful mayors who were made scapegoats for anti-corruption drives and eventually executed. We just don't know at what point on this spectrum Bo will end up. Bo's story seems hard to follow for outsiders, but nonetheless, it's worth watching. In China, the most important leadership decisions are made by small groups huddling behind closed doors. This means that unexpected incidents such as Bo's fall offer precious if hard to decipher signs. Chinese high politics remains a black box in many ways, and like those in airplanes, its secrets will only be revealed when there's a crash. There's no indication of that happening to the Communist Party anytime soon, so for now we should make the most of the hints. One thing we can be sure of: We haven't seen the last of factional politics in the Communist Party. Perhaps the strongest evidence of this is how the official press has been full of statements about the leadership being unified. When this sort of message is made too forcefully, there is likely widespread anxiety about its truthfulness. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Wasserstrom.","Bo Xilai, once a powerful politician in China, was removed from his post in March .

"London (CNN) -- ""Lone wolves"" who plot to carry out small-scale attacks on soft targets, like those in which seven people have been killed in France, could be the future of terrorism, a security expert has warned. ""We are witnessing the next stage of terrorism in Europe,"" said Sajjan Gohel, director of International Security at the Asia Pacific Foundation, a London-based counterterrorism think tank. Mohammed Merah is suspected of carrying out a series of shootings in which seven people, three of them young children, have died in recent days. Merah, 23, a self-styled al Qaeda jihadist, was found dead after a 31-hour siege at his home in France on Thursday. Gohel told CNN that killings like those in Toulouse and Montauban would likely inspire other radical Islamists to action. ""This has sent out the message that followers of al Qaeda can carry out successful attacks, can precipitate terror, on their own. ""This is exactly what happened in France: People were scared to go out, schools were under guard, there was a real sense of insecurity -- that is true terrorism."" He said the actions of Anders Breivik, whose twin bomb and gun attacks in Oslo and on the island of Utoya in Norway in July last year left 77 people dead, had also encouraged would-be terrorists. ""Although it wasn't linked to al Qaeda, the Norway attack set a dangerous precedent, because it showed that a plot like this could succeed."" And Gohel said there were fears the upcoming Olympic Games, due to be held in London this summer, could be targeted. ""The sort of attack we've seen in Toulouse is not a model that is unique to France -- it could be replicated in Germany, in Britain, or elsewhere -- and that is a real concern, especially in the lead-up to the Olympics in London later this year. ""The Olympics are of symbolic significance, because the day after the 2012 games were awarded to London, in 2005, we had the 7/7 bombings [on public transport, in which 52 people were killed]. ""And so there is a sort of a scar associated with that, and it could be that those who sympathize with the motives of the bombers see the Olympics as a symbolic time to attack."" But he said counter-terrorism forces faced a major challenge in tackling 'lone wolf' attacks. ""They are a real headache for the authorities, because they are very difficult to thwart: If a 'cell' is only one or two people it's a lot harder to monitor their activities, to trace their networks, and so on. ""In previous cases, the ability of the authorities to disrupt the planning stage has been low, because you don't get the leakage of information that you get with a larger cell."" Merah, the suspect in the French killings, was a supporter of radical Islamist group Forsane Alizza, the Knights of Glory, France's Interior Minister Claude Gueant said. Gohel said the organization, which has members in Paris and Limoges in central France, acts as an ""antechamber towards terrorism,"" encouraging its followers to go abroad for training. ""Before it was banned earlier this year, it had posted a chilling warning on Facebook, encouraging its followers to attack Americans, Jews and French soldiers,"" said Gohel. ""Unfortunately, that threat seems to have been carried out in recent days."" The security analyst told CNN al Qaeda's role in the Toulouse and Montauban killings remained unclear. ""There are two schools of thought -- that it could be an al Qaeda-controlled attack, or that it could be an al Qaeda-inspired attack -- and either way, it's a real concern. ""If it's al Qaeda-controlled, it shows that al Qaeda is still able to recruit European-based followers, and to train and guide them into carrying out attacks. ""If it's al Qaeda-inspired, then it's the first 'lone wolf' act of terror of its kind to succeed in the West. There have been many al Qaeda-inspired attempts, but so far they have all failed -- are we seeing that in this instance it has succeeded?""","""Lone wolves"" who carry out attacks on soft targets could be future of terrorism, expert warns .

"BELGRADE, Serbia -- Partizan Belgrade are unlikely to appeal against their ban from the UEFA Cup, the Serbian first division club's deputy general secretary Gordan Petric said on Thursday. There is little for the Partizan players to celebrate after UEFA's verdict. ""We will decide what to do over the next few days but appealing against the verdict may not be the smartest thing to do because UEFA may react by imposing even stronger repercussions,"" Petric told Belgrade's B 92 television. ""We really left no room to the UEFA Disciplinary Committee to be lenient because we had been punished in 25 of our 36 European matches in the last five years and we need to address the problem very seriously,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, UEFA took the most drastic action against a Serbian club to date, banning them from European competition for one year and fining them 50,000 Swiss francs ($41.259). The penalty followed serious crowd trouble during Partizan's 6-1 win at Bosnian rivals Zrinjski Mostar in last week's UEFA Cup first qualifying round first leg. UEFA said on its official website Partizan could appeal against the verdict within three days of the European governing body sending out the formal grounds for its decision. Subject to any such appeal, UEFA confirmed that Zrinjski would now progress to the second qualifying round. Violence in last Thursday's match erupted early in the first half after rival fans clashed with police while pelting each other with rocks, flares and ripped-up seats. Play was held up for 10 minutes and resumed only after the few riot police on duty managed to create a buffer zone between the 8,000 home fans and the visitors. After the game, 36 people were injured and six arrested. Police used tear gas to separate the home fans from departing Partizan supporters. Violence is rife in Serbian football and clubs well as the national team have been made to play their matches either behind closed doors or at neutral venues in recent times. Serbia kicked off their Euro 2008 qualifying campaign in an empty stadium after trouble during their 2006 World Cup home qualifier against Bosnia.

"(CNN) -- The recent smartphone video of Marines urinating on the bodies of slain Taliban should trouble all Americans. It is troubling even if allowances are made for young men -- recently released from the high pressures of combat and in the euphoria of being successful and still being alive -- doing dumb things. It should trouble us even allowing for the inevitable dehumanization of the enemy that often accompanies conflict. Keeping the human aspect of an enemy in mind is more than just a moral imperative, though. It makes good operational and strategic sense. And in this, intelligence has a special role. One of the first briefings I gave President George W. Bush as deputy director of national intelligence was on Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the fiendishly brutal head of al Qaeda in Iraq. I began with Zarqawi's upbringing: ""Raised on the mean streets of Zarqa, jailed as a teenager, he turned to religion in prison ..."" I was less trying to humanize him than to understand him, but the effect was largely the same. And even duly ""humanized,"" Zarqawi remained our highest priority target in Iraq until we killed him the next year. Recognizing this human aspect of an enemy takes on even greater significance when a belligerent decides that it's time to negotiate with an adversary, when it's decided (or reluctantly accepted) that you will not be able to simply impose your will on him. This, by the way, is different than concluding that someone with whom you are still engaged in combat is no longer your enemy, as Vice President Joe Biden recently did when describing the Taliban. But it does mean that you are willing to recognize that he has legitimate political interests and you are willing to talk about them. Under any circumstance, talks with the Taliban will be a difficult task. For one thing, the pressure we can bring to bear on our negotiating partner diminishes daily as American troops leave Afghanistan based on an accelerated timetable rather than on battlefield conditions. A recent survey of national security wonks like myself had a full three-quarters of respondents either opposing these talks or saying they are likely to fail. So this is going to be tough and, as in many difficult undertakings, intelligence will be expected to play an important role. Taliban has met with U.S. officials, won't negotiate with Karzai . At the most basic level, intelligence will be asked what are the Taliban's interests or more precisely what is it they think they are. Intelligence will work to steal secrets: What are their demands, their going-in positions, their true red lines? In this case, negotiators will also want to know whether their Taliban interlocutors actually speak for the whole. Can they deliver on an agreement? I recall during the Bush administration, in one of our periodic crises with Syria, being asked by the president: ""What does Assad want?"" It was a question that went to the nature of the man. I responded with the often true but rarely useful, ""I don't know."" And I little helped the situation by meekly adding that I doubted that he did either. We did better during later negotiations with North Korea where, despite whatever negotiating strategy was being proposed, we stuck to the line that we saw little chance that Kim Jong Il would ever give up his nuclear weapons. We'll need the intelligence agencies to be equally accurate and equally firm in their judgments when it comes to the Taliban talks. Intelligence may be able to help in other ways since it has been routine for American intelligence officials to meet with and come to agreement with foreign counterparts, many of whom share little of our world view, our values or even our interests. A good thing, too, since one of the continuities between Presidents Bush and Obama has been the willingness to work with some unsavory partners such as President Ali Abdullah Saleh of Yemen or several recent incarnations of Pakistan's ISI. I can recall many a meeting with counterparts where the common space where we might find agreement was challengingly small. In some of those sessions, my counterpart would depart the seemingly fact-based dialogue we had been sharing and launch into a series of conclusions based more on his culture's creation mythology than on any shared reality I could identify. For a time, I thought it sufficient to simply avoid signaling any agreement at these moments and patiently tolerate the excursion. Only later did I begin to ask myself what of my commentary had my counterpart judged to be American mythology rather than hard realism. Distinguishing and dealing with the differences will be important in the upcoming negotiations. Steve Kappes, who has served as deputy director of CIA for me and Leon Panetta, had to do as much when he earlier negotiated the end of Libya's WMD program with a regime as vile and erratic as the Taliban. This is not to suggest that intelligence officials will actually conduct negotiations in this instance. Marc Grossman, U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, brings as much talent, hard work and knowledge to the problem as anyone could. But I am suggesting that if these talks go forward, we will need a very deep understanding of the people across the table from us, people who when last in power imposed a hellish regime on their countrymen and who today have the blood of innocents on their hands. Much of this will be distasteful, but even if the Taliban aren't simply contemporary manifestations of J.R.R. Tolkien's darkest characters, is there enough common ground to get us to a conclusion we might not ideally desire but is at least what David Petraeus has described in other circumstances as ""Afghan good enough?"" Frankly, I don't think there is, and intelligence agencies will have to have the courage to say so if this is the case. But we have decided to try and, if we are to have any chance of success, deep understanding of the human beings across the table from us, understanding anchored on near exquisite intelligence, will be essential.

"(CNN) -- Consider this. On December 17, 2010, Mohamed Bouazizi, a young Tunisian street vendor, set himself on fire and started a dramatic remaking of the political landscape. The striking of a match brought change not only in Tunisia, but also in Egypt and Libya, and even what is happening in Syria. On the other hand, since March 2011, about 29 Tibetans, mostly Buddhist monks and nuns, have self-immolated in Tibetan parts of China. In March 2012 alone, seven people self-immolated, and Tibetan exiles in India have been setting themselves on fire. The political result? Nothing. So why does the self-immolation of one man accomplish so much, but the same gesture performed by so many others accomplishes nothing? Perhaps the question should be phrased differently, because a closer look at Bouazizi's deed and the Tibetan cases reveals that it is something other than the sheer number of self-immolations that makes them a catalyst for change. Tunisians could easily identify with Bouazizi's extreme predicament. His actions spoke to the community's shared frustration and despair. But the demands of Tibetan self-immolators are varied. Some want a ""free Tibet,"" as do all Tibetan exiles, but others only want freedom of religion, or political autonomy, or the opportunity to study in Tibetan as opposed to Chinese, or the return of the Dalai Lama to Tibet. When a self-immolator like Bouazizi is perceived as taking upon himself the humiliations and shameful submissions, the collective cowardice and voluntary servitude of his people, he burns off, along with his body, the diffuse sense of shame and guilt that has been paralyzing his community. The burning body thus becomes a site of cleansing, catharsis and regeneration. The community is going -- vicariously, but no less effectively -- through a ""purification by fire."" And in the process an important thing takes place: That society reinvents itself, it is transformed from a shattered community into a political community. As the body is being devoured by flames, the promise (if only the promise) of a new beginning takes shape. The self-immolations of Thích Quàng Đúc in Saigon in 1963 and Jan Palach in Prague in 1969 were not very different from that of Bouazizi. The former was a Buddhist monk who self-immolated to draw attention to the persecution of Buddhists in Vietnam under the Ngô Đình Diem's regime; the latter was a philosophy student who did the same thing in Prague as a response to the Soviet Union's crush of the Prague Spring. Self-immolations that prompt political change are extraordinary and rare events. The ancient Greeks had two different words for time: chronos for ordinary time and kairos for time of special quality -- a particularly propitious time for which our ""right time"" is a rather weak translation. For self-immolations to be politically successful, they have to happen in kairos. Bouazizi, Đúc and Palach had many imitators, but none since have achieved so much. That's why the high number of self-immolations among Tibetans lately could be read as an implicit admission of failure. Even though the first self-immolation by a former Tibetan monk, Thupten Ngodup, on April 27, 1998, in New Delhi, had some public impact, it failed to cause the political commotion that Bouazizi triggered in the Arab world. Nor have any of the other Tibetan self-immolators since. Yet, this should not surprise us. There is a strong rejection of violence in Buddhism. Even through self-immolations took place in medieval China and 20th-century Vietnam, even though the Lotus Sutra praises ""burning for Buddha"" as the supreme self-sacrifice, Buddhists are very reluctant to condone violence. Tibetan Buddhism, in particular, is centered on compassion toward all sentient beings and prohibition of murder, suicide included. Such a religious and cultural viewpoint must prevent ordinary Tibetans from identifying with the self-immolators. Accommodating this radical form of violence within a culture that has for centuries fed on cosmic compassion and political non-violence is not an easy process. That is why the recent string of self-immolations in Tibetan parts of China is a sign that this could be changing. Most self-immolators are young -- some are teens -- which indicates that the new generation of politically aware Tibetans might have lost patience with the Dalai Lama's nonviolent political philosophy and want to respond differently to the Chinese's aggressive methods. What we see now is possibly the beginning of a new type of political engagement in Tibet, a new pattern very different from Bouazizi's and Palach's, who emerged from communities that had been brought to their knees. Tibetans, instead, over the last 60 years have considered their nation as occupied, but not defeated. Since 1959 they have with some regularity risen against the Chinese authorities. It's very disturbing to watch these self-immolations, but that is part of the intent. The Tibetans want the Chinese and the world to look. The meaning of their gesture lies in its total passivity. It is no accident that after every self-immolation the Chinese authorities scramble to confiscate and destroy any pictures taken; they are only too aware of the iconic status such images can acquire. In essence, these self-immolations are an extreme form of political self-expression. They are performed as part of a struggle for recognition, as an autonomous political community. It confirms what Thích Nhất Hạnh was saying in 1967: ""To burn oneself by fire is to prove that what one is saying is of the utmost importance. There is nothing more painful than burning oneself. To say something while experiencing this kind of pain is to say it with utmost courage, frankness, determination and sincerity."" For many Tibetan monks and nuns of today the burning body has become a tool for the most resounding of self-assertions; when you are in flames your presence cannot be ignored anymore. It is a shouting game of sorts, except that no party shouts. The Tibetans express themselves by burning; the Chinese authorities do the same by shooting Tibetans. Then, another monk or nun engages in self-expression and everything starts anew. Palden Gyatso, a Tibetan monk who spent more than 30 years in Chinese prisons and labor camps, once said: ""For those who use brute force, there is nothing more insulting than a victim's refusal to acknowledge their power."" Rarely has the desire for recognition been so desperate and moving.

"(CNN) -- Did French intelligence services miss vital clues as Mohammed Merah showed signs of growing radicalization? In the words of the French newspaper, L'Express, on Thursday: ""Did the security services fail in their surveillance?"" How do western intelligence agencies choose who to focus on as terror suspects, amid hundreds that express or harbor militant views? Do they have sufficient resources; and where lies the balance between surveillance and the protection of civil liberties? These are just a few of the questions emerging after Merah's killings. Merah had been on the radar of the French intelligence service for several years. He'd been detained in Afghanistan in 2010 and repatriated to France -- only to return to the Afghan-Pakistan border area in August of last year. He'd been interviewed by the French security services last November after returning from the Af-Pak area a second time. But he had apparently persuaded them, even showing photographs he had taken, that he had been on a tourist trip. In addition, it has emerged that Merah was on a U.S. no-fly-list, according to U.S. officials, which would have prevented him from boarding any U.S.-bound flight. There were also worrisome signs before he left for Afghanistan. Two years ago, Merah ""held"" a 15-year-old boy in his apartment and forced him to watch videos of al Qaeda beheadings. When confronted by his mother, he assaulted her -- and she made a report to police. French media report that after the incident Merah donned military fatigues and yelled ""I'm al Qaeda"" in the street near the woman's house. By then, he already had multiple convictions for minor offenses, and several jail sentences. Both he and his older brother Abdelkader were known to the security services because of their membership of a small Salafist group in Toulouse. French prosecutors say Abdelkader was implicated in a network sending Islamic militants to Iraq in 2007 but not charged because of inadequate evidence. He is currently under arrest but has not been charged. But at the same time Merah did not fit any ""conventional"" profile of a jihadist-to-be. He was a motor-bike enthusiast and soccer player. According to his attorney, Christian Etelin, he was usually quiet and courteous -- ""not rigid to the point of falling into fanaticism."" But Etelin said there were signs of a ""dual personality"" in Merah. Friends have told French reporters of their shock at his sudden metamorphosis to killer. French Interior Minister Claude Geant defended the work of France's equivalent of the FBI, the Direction Centrale du Renseignement IntÃ©rieur. The DCRI ""follows a lot of people who are involved in Islamist radicalism,"" he said Thursday. ""Expressing ideas, showing Salafist opinions is not enough to bring someone before justice,"" he said. Nor had there been any ""criminal tendencies"" among Islamist radicals in Toulouse, which has a large population of North African origin, he said. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a radio network Thursday that ""light must be shed"" on events leading up to the shootings by Merah. ""I understand that one can ask whether there was a failing or not. As I don't know if there was a failing, I can't tell you what kind of failing, but light must be shed on that,"" Juppe said on Europe 1. One avenue of inquiry may be communication between different security agencies in France. For example the DCRI tracks French citizens who have returned from overseas travels; the role of the external spy service DGSE includes keeping tabs on foreigners in France suspected of links to extremism. Other questions include the judicial authority needed for some forms of surveillance, although police in France can tap telephones with the approval of the Prime Minister and an administrative panel. There is also the issue of budget cuts at the DCRI over the past few years. Whether and how the DCRI dropped the ball in Merah's case has already entered the bloodstream of the presidential race in France, with the candidate of the far-right National Front, Marine Le Pen, demanding an inquiry into whether the intelligence services took necessary precautions in Merah's case and complaining of the government's laxity in the face of the ""fundamentalist risk."" Another candidate, FranÃ§ois Bayrou, expressed surprise that Merah had been able to buy weapons without drawing attention, after so many convictions. In past cases efforts by terror suspects to make bombs, or gather the materials to do so, have triggered alerts. For example, attempts to buy large amounts of fertilizer or other ingredients -- such as hydrogen peroxide -- used in bomb-making are often relayed to law enforcement agencies. An attempt by Najibullah Zazi to contact a handler in the Afghan-Pakistan border area as he tried make the high explosive PETN in a Denver motel room was intercepted by counter-terrorism officers. Zazi planned suicide bomb attacks on the New York subway; he is now serving a life sentence in federal prison. By contrast, planning a gun attack -- such as those in Toulouse or at Fort Hood -- is less likely to trigger alarms. Guns are easier to acquire (though less so in Europe than in the United States) and easier to use than home-made bombs. That's perhaps why al Qaeda propagandists like American-born Adam Gadahn have urged followers in the United States to buy weapons at gun shows. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle,"" Gadahn said in a video posted last year. Across Europe and in the United States, radicalization within rapidly growing North African and South Asian populations has stretched domestic intelligence services, especially given substantial traffic between western countries and places like Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. Some previous terror cases - in Minneapolis, the United Kingdom and Germany -- have shown second-generation immigrants to be less assimilated than their parents, and more conflicted about their surroundings. Certainly that was the case among the bombers who carried out the July 2005 subway attacks in Britain, and among young some 20 Somali-Americans who suddenly left to wage jihad with al Shabaab in 2008. Those who are ""self-radicalized,"" who remain beyond any cell structure, who drift from one job or place of residence to another (as Merah did) are the most difficult to track. And counter-terrorism experts say a myriad of factors, many of them unpredictable, may be involved in pushing an individual from expressing militant views into committing bloody acts. Even apparently obvious signs have been missed in previous terror cases. When British intelligence broke up a plot in 2004 to use fertilizer in a series of attacks, it discounted the plotters' links to two men - Mohammed Sidique Khan and Shehzad Tanweer. The pair went on to commit suicide bombing attacks on the London subway in July 2005. The UK domestic intelligence agency MI5 said in a statement later that Khan and Tanweer ""appeared as petty fraudsters in loose contact with members of the plot. There was no indication that they were involved in the planning of any kind of terrorist attack in the UK."" Similarly, new research into the planning of the 2004 Madrid train bombings, published in the latest edition of the CTC Sentinel by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, shows extensive contacts between the plotters and al Qaeda's leadership. For two years, according to author Fernando Reinares, a key intermediary who had been part of an al Qaeda cell in Spain since the mid-1990s planned the attacks, returning to Spain from Pakistan months before the bombings. Reinares, who became a senior adviser on counter-terrorism in the Spanish government after the attacks, writes that when the Madrid cell was dismantled in 2001, there was insufficient evidence to prosecute at least three men. All became ringleaders in the bombings that killed 191 people on March 11 2004. Germany's problems in tracking right-wing extremists are also instructive. After several immigrants were murdered by neo-Nazis between 2000 and 2007, investigations established a lack of co-ordination between different state and federal agencies. The government responded with a plan to establish a central database of right-wing extremists available to the police and state authorities. But legal experts have questioned the criteria for including suspects and the blurring of lines between intelligence services and the police. Some critics also say such databases can include so many names that they become redundant. By any standard, the record of the French intelligence services has been impressive to date, aided by some of Europe's toughest anti-terrorism laws. More than 200 people in France have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 2001. A French counter-terrorism source told CNN in 2010 that the security services had established a large network of informants within France's Muslim communities - but cautioned that it had proved much more difficult to recruit informers among the younger generation of French Muslims. On Thursday, President Nicolas Sarkozy announced plans for legislation that would make it an offense for anybody to view jihadist websites regularly in France or travel abroad for jihadist training. There has been no terror attack on mainland France since 1995, when a series of bombings was claimed by a group calling itself the Armed Islamic Group general command. One of the devices exploded at a Toulouse police station. The man behind the attacks, Khaled Kelkal, was also of Algerian origin and had grown up in a poor district of Lyon. But the 17 years of peace since is unlikely to spare the DCRI from some penetrating questioning after the events of the last week.

"(CNN) -- Campaigning resumed in the French presidential election on Thursday following the violent death of shooting suspect Mohammed Merah following a police siege in Toulouse. Merah was wanted for the killings of three French paratroopers and of three children and a rabbi at a Jewish school in the city, in a string of shootings beginning March 11 that shook the nation. Merah had told French police he trained with al Qaeda in Pakistan, and he had planned to attack more soldiers and police, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said. He said he was acting alone, the prosecutor added. Most candidates in the election suspended campaigning following the most recent shooting in Toulouse, but normal politics resumed following the bloody end to the siege. How did candidates react to the crisis? Most candidates called for national unity amid the national outpouring of grief for the victims. President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is running for a second term, visited Toulouse and offered his sympathies to bereaved families. Other candidates even flew to the city on the same plane to show their respects. Sarkozy's main rival, Socialist Party candidate Francois Hollande, suspended his campaign ""to honor the memories"" of the victims. Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen initially cancelled campaign events, saying politics must be suspended ""as a sign of compassion and solidarity."" Did the mood of unity hold? In a word, no. Le Pen, who is running in third place in opinion polls, was the first to break ranks with this rare outbreak of political consensus, CNN's Jim Bittermann noted. The National Front leader said ""The danger of fundamentalism has been under-estimated in our country."" This sparked an angry response from far-left challenger Jean-Luc Melenchon, who accused the National Front of being ""vultures"" feeding at the scene of crimes. Centrist candidate Francois Bayrou accused the extreme right of trying to ""surf"" to power on the back of the attacks. Bayrou, currently in fourth place, refused to suspend his campaign during the hunt for the attackers, and criticized rivals for their anti-immigrant comments, which he said may have provoked the suspect into action. Other candidates said it was impossible to make this link. Was race an issue before the attacks? Along with the economic crisis, immigration and race have been prevalent themes in the campaign for the presidential election, the first round of which takes place next month. Sarkozy declared this month there were ""too many foreigners"" in France, while Le Pen has criticized the production of Islamic halal meat in Paris. Political analyst Simon Persico, from the Center of European Studies in Paris, said Sarkozy won the 2007 election by being right-wing, and taking a strong stance on race, but had found it difficult to maintain this stance while in power. ""In this election, Le Pen is saying the original is better than the copy, and that voters should not believe Sarkozy on race,"" he told CNN. ""Whichever viewpoint is true though, the president has a record of five years of creating conflict, and while he may say he was right to raise the issue of the growth of Islamic fundamentalists in France, maybe now is the time to appease tensions on race."" How do the public view Sarkozy's handling of the crisis? The president, who had been lagging behind Hollande for most of the campaign, seems to have received an initial political boost from the tragedy, said political commentator Christian Malard, senior analyst for France 3 TV. ""Sarkozy is observed by many people to have been acting well and decisively during the crisis,"" he said. But the socialists were asking why it took more than 30 hours to kill Merah -- and how he could kill so many people while he was under surveillance by security services. ""Sarkozy must tread warily: a year ago he oversaw the ban on Islamic veils in public but he is aware there are six million Muslims in France, half of them from North African former colonies, and he is careful to say few of them are radical. ""So if Sarkozy is to beat Hollande he must win over the electorate of both the center, and the far-right of Le Pen. He needs all the people."" The crisis could yet have a negative effect on Sarkozy though, with the far-right saying that the government had failed to protect French people from Islamic fundamentalists. Thierry Arnaud, senior political correspondent for BFM TV, said that while Sarkozy had benefited from appearing statesmanlike in recent weeks it remained to be seen what long-term advantage he would gain. ""He is certainly anxious to resume campaigning"" to create momentum, Arnaud noted. What impact will the attacks have on campaigning? Many voters are keen for the political rhetoric to cool and the focus to turn to more mundane matters. The state of the economy and unemployment, especially among the young and ethnic minorities, remains the main concern for most voters. For this reason, as Persico noted, Sarkozy may be keen to keep the focus on security and the Toulouse attacks -- issues on which he looks strong. Before the crisis, Hollande was ahead in the polls thanks to a strong showing on economic issues, Malard said but added that even on this issue the president was gaining ground. ""Lots of people are telling me that between Hollande and Sarkozy, 'we might switch our votes to Sarkozy.' ""This debate between Sarkozy and Hollande is turning into a battle between two heavyweight fighters, but amid the storm of the economic crisis and world upheavals a lot of people are coming back to Sarkozy.""","Campaigning resumed in the French presidential election on Thursday following the death of Mohammed Merah .

"(CNN) -- It's a rare thing for the threads of an ongoing crisis to be pulled so closely together in a discrete event, compressed in time and space as if they were part of a dramatization, as they were when President Obama met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this month in the Oval Office. This session had it all: primal Israeli, Iranian, American and even Arab interests; nuclear proliferation and global energy supplies; existential dangers; war and peace. The meeting was no doubt made more difficult by the strained relations between the two leaders, but in truth, this one needed little personal antipathy to make it hard. Even though both men had announced that Iran's acquisition of a nuclear weapon was unacceptable, there was no final agreement on how to prevent that from happening. In many ways, I suspect, the two men talked past one another. Recall high school math and being forced to solve algebraic equations? Something like that may have taken place in the Oval, with Obama pointing out how hard we were working to solve for ""y"" where ""y"" represented Iranian intentions. Unfortunately, in the prime minister's equation, ""y"" had already been defined as a constant. Israel believes that it knows where the Iranians are going. In its equation, the unknown is ""x."" What does the United States intend to do about it? Clearly, the president was aware of this. Comments about having Israel's back, rejecting containment, even a little tough talk about not being one to bluff -- all this was calibrated to convince Netanyahu that this president would act. But when? On the long flight back to Jerusalem, Netanyahu was surely asking himself that question. Israel's window of opportunity to attack Iran's nuclear network is closing. Even allowing for Israeli ingenuity and courage, this was never going to be easy, and it's getting harder by the day, as much of the target is being moved into a fortified mountain near Qom. If Israel defers the attack much longer, its military option will simply cease to exist as the Iranian program gets more hardened, more dispersed and more advanced. The American window, of course, will remain open longer, a reflection of the raw numbers, weapons, mobility, range and proximate basing that the United States can bring to bear. But will America move? Can Israel afford to give up its own place in the lineup in the belief that the United States, hitting lower in the order, will actually go up to the plate and take its swings? And so Netanyahu will ask himself, what are their red lines? What will convince them to act? Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta probably gave the clearest administration statement when he said that if ""we get intelligence that they're proceeding with developing a nuclear weapon, then we will take whatever steps are necessary to stop it."" That, combined with the president's repeated statements that Iran getting a nuclear weapon is ""unacceptable,"" surprisingly aligns this administration with the George W. Bush administration's doctrine of pre-emption. That doctrine famously described it as a duty to ""anticipate and counter threats, using all elements of national power, before the threats can do grave damage."" Combining ""unacceptable"" with ""whatever steps are necessary"" seems to put Iran's possession of a weapon -- or, more accurately, an Iranian decision to pursue a weapon -- in that doctrine's category of ""hostile acts by our adversaries."" And that imposes quite a burden on American intelligence. I recall thinking with the announcement of the pre-emption approach in 2001-02 (while I was director of the National Security Agency) of how good American intelligence would have to be to identify such threats and to identify them at the confidence level that would be needed to justify America shooting first. How tall an order that could be was evident in the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. There the intelligence community not only got most of it wrong -- there was no active nuclear program, nor were there chemical or biological weapons stockpiles -- we compounded the mistake with overconfident language that invited others to use intelligence as evidence. Intelligence is designed to inform policy-making even in the face of doubt, to allow officials to judge potential action while ambiguity still exists. It rarely reaches the level of evidence required in a court of law to prove matters beyond a reasonable doubt. We may have gotten it a little better in 2007, when we informed the president that Syria had built a nuclear reactor with North Korean assistance. However, we cautioned him that we had low confidence that it was part of a nuclear weapons program, not because there was an alternative explanation that made much sense but simply because our body of knowledge on the other parts needed for such a program (like a reprocessing facility or weaponization work) was pretty thin. In that instance, the president rejected pre-emption. (The site was bombed by Israeli aircraft.) And now with Iran, intelligence judgments remain anchored to a controversial 2007 National Intelligence Estimate that in 2003, Tehran had ""halted"" its nuclear weapon design and weaponization work. That estimate was based not on the absence of evidence that such work was ongoing but rather on evidence that it was not. And despite some suspicious and troubling Iranian activity since then, the estimate has survived largely intact, under three subsequent heads of national intelligence and of the CIA. So there we are. The challenge for American intelligence now is to inform the president of an Iranian decision to weaponize its nuclear stockpile with sufficient confidence and in sufficient time for him to decide to launch a pre-emptive war in one of the world's most sensitive and volatile regions. It's hard to imagine a higher bar, especially since building the ""sufficient confidence"" will almost certainly eat into the ""sufficient time."" And especially since, when that last situation room meeting is held, the intelligence will probably not be at that courtroom evidentiary standard of beyond all reasonable doubt. The president showed that he could act in the face of ambiguity when he launched the Abbottabad raid to kill Osama bin Laden. This one will be even more difficult. For Netanyahu, we can identify this as ""x."" For the importance of ""x,"" see above. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael V. Hayden.","Michael Hayden: U.S. policy on Iran implies pre-emption idea from Bush administration .

"(CNN) -- For desperately ill patients with serious, life-threatening antibiotic-resistant infections, access to new antibiotics is a matter of life and death. All across America, people are dying from bacterial infections that we used to be able to cure with antibiotics. Just this March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned the public about a four-fold increase in one group of ""nightmare bacteria,"" carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which kills up to 50% of the people infected, and is on the rise. The annual impact of antibiotic resistant infections on the U.S. health care system is estimated to be $21 billion to $34 billion in excess health care costs and more than 8 million additional hospital days. At the same time, we are not making new antibiotics fast enough to prevent these deaths. Without new antibiotics, things we all take for granted, including surgery, chemotherapy, organ transplantation and premature infant care, will be in jeopardy. A streamlined but targeted approach that speeds regulatory approval of new antibiotics -- and limits their use to the sickest of the sick -- is an appropriate way to balance the safety risks of these new drugs with the lifesaving benefits they can offer patients who have no other treatment options. As a practicing infectious disease physician, my colleagues and I are seeing firsthand the devastating effects that resistant infections have on patients. Consider Addie Rerecich, who was a healthy, athletic 11-year-old in 2011 before she spent five months in an Arizona hospital battling several serious drug-resistant infections that her doctors did not have antibiotics powerful enough to treat. Addie ultimately needed a double lung transplant to save her life. The health care costs from her hospital stay alone totaled $6 million, and she will need medical attention and therapy for the rest of her life. As resistant infections like those that nearly took Addie's life continue to increase, the antibiotic pipeline is nearly dry, with few drugs in development that will work against the most alarming pathogens our patients face. A proposal from the Infectious Diseases Society of America aims to address a key part of the problem by reducing the obstacles to regulatory approval of new antibiotics for use in a distinct, narrow group of people: Patients with serious resistant infections that have no effective treatment options left. How will this make a difference? The current regulatory environment in the U.S. discourages drug companies from antibiotic research and development, and few firms are active in this area today. Antibiotics also aren't as profitable as other drugs, such as those for chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes, which patients often take for years. A more direct path for regulatory approval can encourage more companies to get involved in antibiotic development again. IDSA's approach -- the Limited Population Antibacterial Drug -- would speed patients' access to new, lifesaving antibiotics by allowing the Food and Drug Administration to approve them for narrow use based on smaller clinical trials than required for more widely used antibiotics. Under LPAD, drug companies will still have to show that a drug's benefits outweigh the risks in patients with serious infections. It's an idea modeled after the successful Orphan Drug Program, which encourages the development of drugs for rare diseases. Promoting the appropriate use of these new antibiotics is critical, because we know antibiotic misuse and overuse are significant drivers of drug resistance. Special labeling will ensure narrow marketing of these drugs. Educational efforts should be put in place to send a strong signal to health care providers, facilities and insurers that these drugs are only for patients who need them most. These drugs will also likely be priced higher, commensurate with their value as life-saving medicines, than traditionally approved antibiotics, another factor that will help limit their wider use. Antibiotic stewardship programs, which encourage appropriate antibiotic use by providers and health facilities, will play a key role. These programs provide much needed support and guidance to clinicians and ensure that our precious resource of antibiotics will be used wisely. Professional medical groups -- including the American Medical Association -- public health organizations, patient groups and pharmaceutical manufacturers have voiced their support for IDSA's proposal. FDA and several members of Congress are also interested in the concept and in moving it forward. To be sure, developing new antibiotics and speeding their approval process to treat seriously ill patients is just one way to grapple with this complex public health crisis. IDSA also promotes enhanced public health efforts, including better data collection and surveillance of drug resistance and the use of antibiotics, improved infection prevention, antimicrobial stewardship, and stronger efforts to encourage the appropriate use of antibiotics in humans and on the farm. Increased research funding to explore how antibiotic resistance develops and spreads is just as vital, along with additional economic incentives and regulatory clarity to boost antibiotic development. Patients like Addie need our help. We must take action now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Helen Boucher.","Obama administration is considering streamlining the approval process for antibiotics .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Fidel Castro appeared publicly in his trademark olive green shirt on Saturday for the first time since he fell ill and renounced power four years ago, according to a state-run website. Castro made his appearance in Artemisa, a town about an hour outside of Havana, also making this his first reported trip outside the capital in four years, according to the website Cubadebate. A picture of the 83-year-old Castro also appeared on the site. Olive green rebel fatigues were his signature uniform during his nearly 50 years of rule. State TV later showed him giving a speech to honor rebels killed 57 years ago during the July 26 attack on an army barracks that ended in failure but launched his revolution. He also put flowers on the rebels' tombs, video showed. Castro handed power to his brother, Raul, in 2006 after undergoing intestinal surgery and disappeared from public view. State media have published occasional videos and photos of the historic leader wearing track suits. Earlier this month, he re-emerged in public for the first time and has made five appearances in closely controlled events, usually donning casual checked shirts. Speculation has grown over the possibility of his attending a mass rally in central Cuba on Monday to commemorate the July 26 events.","Olive green rebel fatigues were the former Cuban leader's signature uniform during his rule .

"London, England (CNN) -- Known as much for his gaffes, brusque manner and eccentricities as for his charity and campaigning work, Prince Philip seems to have lived a life permanently in the shadow of his wife, Queen Elizabeth II. Yet as a child born into the turmoil of inter-war Europe, a naval officer decorated for heroism in World War II, and one half of one of the most-enduring modern royal marriages, the Duke of Edinburgh is an extraordinary figure in his own right. And while Britain celebrated 60 years since the queen succeeded as monarch earlier this year, the spotlight also shone on the man who has rarely left her side during her time in the spotlight. Prince Philip's life was dramatic from the outset. The nephew of Greece's King Constantine I, he was born in 1921 on the dining room table of a villa on the Greek island of Corfu. Known then simply as Philip -- he had no official surname -- he was forced into exile just 18 months later when the Greek monarchy was overthrown by a military revolt. Sailors on board HMS Calypso, the British cruiser given the secret mission to carry his family to safety, made him a crib out of an old fruit box. Stateless and (by royal standards) poor, Philip's family spent the next few years wandering between the homes of European relatives as the continent descended into the political and economic upheaval that would lead to World War II. After his mother Alice was committed to a psychiatric clinic in 1930, Philip rarely saw his parents. He was instead mentored by an uncle, Lord Mountbatten, and dispatched to a series of boarding schools in England, Germany and Scotland. In 1936, Greece voted to reinstate its monarchy, but Philip's father Andrea resisted pressure to push his son into Greek military service. Instead, Philip remained at Gordonstoun, the school in Scotland where he would later send his own sons, and began to prepare for training in Britain's Royal Navy. By the time he reached his late teens, Philip's dashing looks were turning heads, including the 13-year-old distant cousin (they are both great, great grandchildren of Queen Victoria) who would later become his bride. But naval duty came first, and with the outbreak of war, Philip was sent to sea. As a citizen of Greece, Philip was initially deployed as a ""neutral foreigner"" serving on naval escort and convoy missions. But after Italy invaded Greece in 1940 he was assigned to Valiant, a battleship that would soon see action in the Mediterranean. Philip was commended for his operation of searchlights during a 1941 night battle near Cape Matapan, where the British destroyed much of the Italian fleet. He was later awarded the Greek War Cross of Valor. After various postings and promotions, Philip was in 1944 appointed first lieutenant of HMS Whelp, a destroyer that went on to see action in the Pacific as part of a British fleet involved with joint operations with the U.S. Navy, including the landings at Iwo Jima. When peace came, Philip remained in the navy, but rekindled a friendship with Elizabeth that quickly blossomed into a public romance. The pair were married in Westminster Abbey in 1947 and shortly afterwards he returned to duty, rising to the rank of lieutenant commander. See also: The Royal family tree . Newly-appointed as Duke of Edinburgh, Philip had to abandon his naval career for royal duties after the queen's father, George VI became ill. The king died while Philip and Elizabeth were on an official trip to Kenya. It was Philip who broke the news to his wife -- now the queen. The early years of the the couple's marriage saw the prince enjoy the height of his popularity. On a 1951 trip to Canada, crowds of admiring women turned out to see the handsome prince. In 1957, Time magazine said he had transformed his ""frosty bride"" into a ""stylish"" royal icon. While affection for the duke remains strong today -- as was shown by an outpouring of concern when he underwent heart surgery last year -- his public image as a dashing young man has long since been replaced by one of an irascible older figure. Many have drawn links between the duke's manner and his experiences as a young man, suggesting his troubled family life helped shape a rather detached and unemotional outlook, while his navy career endowed him with a salty wit that frequently raises eyebrows. Others attest to his charisma and charm, characteristics that no doubt helped fuel rumors of indiscretions in the early years of his marriage. In 1956, the year before Philip was officially appointed as a prince, the queen's household had to officially deny such rumors. The duke himself has spoken of his own struggles to find a purpose within the royal family, saying he took on patronages -- including the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme he created to recognize community service -- out of duty rather than passion. ""I didn't want to be president of the World Wildlife Fund,"" he said in an interview in 1992. ""I was asked to do it. I'd much rather have stayed in the navy, frankly."" Yet he has found time to pursue his own, sometimes odd, interests. Over the years these have included polo, competitive horse carriage driving (a sport in which he has represented Britain) science, the study of UFOs, practical jokes, painting and taking the wheel of his own London taxi. But despite several recent high profile appearances, the duke has taken a step back from public life in the past year. ""I reckon I've done my bit,"" he said in a 2011 interview. ""I want to enjoy myself a bit now, with less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say.""","Prince Philip experienced a turbulent early life after his family was forced into exile .

"(CNN) -- ""A nation's joy, a husband's nerves,"" exclaimed Britain's Daily Mail newspaper, as it contrasted Prince William's anxious wait at his pregnant wife's bedside with the excitement generated by news of her impending motherhood. The revelation that Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, was pregnant came after she was admitted to hospital in London on Monday afternoon suffering acute morning sickness. The newspaper said the royal couple had hoped to keep their baby news under wraps until Christmas Day, when she had passed the 12-week mark in her pregnancy. ""Kate expectations,"" declared popular British tabloid, The Sun, with an article detailing the treatment that Catherine, 30, was receiving for hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition that causes more severe nausea and vomiting than typical morning sickness. The newspaper said even senior royals, including Queen Elizabeth II, were taken by surprise as the couple had yet to break the news to family. The Sun's graphics department produced composite images of what they speculated the royal baby would look like as a baby of either gender, while the Mail ran mock-ups created by a U.S. forensic artist imagining how the child might look as a young boy or girl. The Times also led with news of Catherine's hospital dash, splashing a picture across its front page of a concerned William leaving London's King Edward VII hospital last night. The paper also joined the rush of feverish debate about the future royal's sex, potential name and position in the royal line of succession. Boy or girl, the new baby will be third in line to the throne, behind William and his father, Prince Charles, who will become a grandfather for the first time. The Times explained that an imminent change to the law means that if Catherine has a girl, the child will make history by being the first British princess not to suffer discrimination because of her sex. UK tabloid the Daily Express, in a ""royal souvenir special"" edition, ran a piece speculating that it was more likely that Catherine was carrying a girl, or twins, citing research that linked those outcomes to morning sickness. Bookmakers also look set for a royal bonanza, with Victoria, Frances and Mary among the frontrunners for the most likely girl's name, though the odds that William's first-born child will be named after his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, have been judged at between 9-1 and 12-1, The Times said. However, Elizabeth is the hot favorite at 8-1, according to leading British bookmaker Ladbrokes. Brooklyn and Chardonnay were listed as long shots by bookmakers. Ladbrokes has Charles and John at 10-1 when it comes to boy's names, but Harry, the name of the baby's uncle, is a distinct outsider at 33-1. Bookmakers are also taking bets on the baby's hair color, with one offering brown at 6-4 and red at 8-1, and another offering odds on the likelihood of an albino royal baby. Bookmakers were also taking bets on the child's birth weight, and the identity of the godparents. As expected, the name game is a white-hot pastime on social media, with #royalbabynames and #royalbaby among the biggest trending hashtags on Twitter. Among the more amusing suggestions were Cheryl and Jedward, reflecting Britain's recent obsession with television talent shows. Twitter was also a popular destination for celebrities and public figures alike to voice their happiness at the news. British Prime Minister David Cameron was swift to offer his congratulations. Businessman Richard Branson joined the well wishers. Former Wimbledon tennis champ Boris Becker tweeted a picture of himself giving two thumbs up with a message of congratulations. The news prompted responses from U.S. celebrities as well, with reality TV star Kim Kardashian tweeting her delight at the reports. News of the royal baby also grabbed column inches internationally. ""Royal baby a bonus for special editions,"" declared The Australian, as it predicted that Australian women's magazines would now go into coverage hyperdrive with a series of royal specials. ""Royal Baby a 'Delight,' Especially to Britain's Tabloids,"" ran the headline in The New York Times. The paper's Sarah Lyall observed that ""speculation began virtually the moment Kate Middleton said 'I will' to Prince William in April 2011, leaving an industry of tabloid newspapers and gossip magazines with a big black hole where their wedding coverage used to be."" Lyall said those who had previously -- and incorrectly -- guessed something was afoot because Catherine was drinking water instead of wine at some official dinner could now finally claim to be right.","Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge expecting first child .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The world's most valuable company is going head-to-head against a financially ailing Chinese electronics company over the right to use the iPad name in the vast market of China -- and the tech giant lost round one. Round two is scheduled Wednesday as the Guangdong Higher People's Court is expected to hear an appeal of a lower court decision in favor of Proview Technology Shenzhen, a company which trademarked the IPAD name in China in 2000 -- 10 years before Apple's iPad hit global stores. Stores in Huizhou and Shijiazhuang were ordered to stop sales of iPads by local authorities after a December 5 ruling in a Shenzhen court against Apple. Meanwhile, legal actions have been filed in Shanghai, Hong Kong and in California by Proview to block Apple from using the iPad name. What's the dispute about? The two companies are mired in an ever bitter battle here -- with both claiming the iPad name is legally theirs. Apple says it bought the name from the struggling Asian electronics firm in 10 different countries. Proview contends it did not sell the rights to the name in China. ""Proview wants to get Apple's full attention,"" said Ma Dongxiao, attorney for Proview. ""If Apple doesn't change the name, it will violate the law here. Apple might be punished by Chinese courts or forbidden from selling the iPad 3 in China."" In a statement to CNN, Apple says, ""We bought Proview's worldwide rights to the iPad trademark in 10 different countries several years ago. Proview refuses to honor their agreement with Apple in China and a Hong Kong court has sided with Apple in this matter. Our case is still pending in mainland China."" As Apple is likely to unveil in March the iPad 3 -- the latest edition of the popular computer tablet -- the case is generating a hailstorm of international attention, and Proview has threatened legal action to block the export and import of the computer tablets -- a move that would disrupt the global supply chain for the tech giant, which depends on Chinese suppliers like Foxconn. Who sold what to whom? The case centers around Proview International Holdings, the Hong Kong-listed maker of computer monitors and other devices. A subsidiary, Proview Taiwan, sold Apple Inc. the rights to use the IPAD name, which the Chinese company had trademarked in China and in markets around the world. But Proview -- which was seized by creditors in 2009 after defaulting on hundreds of millions of loans -- said it didn't know it was selling the rights to Apple. Moreover -- and this is the key point on which the legal dispute rests -- Proview Taiwan didn't own the rights to the IPAD trademark in China; another subsidiary, Proview Shenzhen, did. Proview says Apple didn't negotiate in good faith - using a shell company that promised not to make competing products under the iPad label. The company alleges the negotiator concealed he was working for Apple, gave a false name, and said the company he represented was IP Application Development -- or IPAD for short. How Apple snookered Proview to get iPad trademark . ""Using shell companies is not uncommon but usually the conduct is honest,"" Ma said. ""Proview was cheated by Apple."" Had Proview executives known they were dealing with Apple, they likely would have asked for more cash, says Kenny Wong, head of the intellectual property practice and partner at Hong Kong law firm Mayer Brown JSM. ""It seems that Proview realized somehow too late who they were dealing with and they felt they were tricked or cheated, so that's why they tried to find loopholes in the contract,"" Wong said. ""And they found a very credible one, according to Chinese law."" Is this about intellectual property rights? The fact that Apple is engaged in a large-scale lawsuit over property rights with a Chinese company in China seems, to many observers, odd. After all, sales of counterfeit movies happen out in the open in China. Even fake Apple and Ikea stores were discovered in China last year. ""I think it's going to increase the awareness of the value of intellectual property,"" technology analyst Andrew Mok told CNN. ""It's ironic that Apple is being sued by a Chinese company where typically it's the other way around."" But Wong disputes the perception that there is a greater propensity to sell counterfeit goods in China. ""You can see fake goods in Milan, you can see them on Fifth Avenue in New York,"" he said. ""There is a perception in China there is very weak enforcement, which to some extent is true, because China is such a big country."" While the China-Proview dispute centers on a trademark deal, the current legal wrangling is ultimately a contract dispute, Wong said. What's next? The hearing on the case is scheduled to begin Wednesday, but any final ruling is likely to be weeks or months away. If Apple loses its appeal, it could take it to the Supreme People's Court -- but that would be a long-shot, Wong said. ""The court hears less than 1% of cases put before them,"" he said. Apple could throw up its hands and decide to rename the tablet in China, but Proview could still sue for damages on past use of its trademarked name, Wong said. But Apple dropping iPad name also could be bad for Proview -- or, more exactly, Proview's creditors. ""As Proview Shenzhen's financial position is dire, its eight creditor banks view the IPAD registrations to be its most valuable asset and would want to see it fetch a 'fair' value,"" Wong wrote in a recent note to clients. ""It is claimed that a settlement (with Apple) will require the bank creditor's approval."" In China, netizens are asking could Apple's popular tablet computer soon be known as the HiPad or MiPad here. But consumers in China say they'll take the Apple product - no matter what it's called. ""I don't care how they play with the four letters,"" one Chinese customer told CNN. CNN's Eunice Yoon contributed to this report.","Apple is embroiled in a lawsuit over use of the iPad name in China .

"(CNN) -- As a young Army officer in Vietnam, Jack Jacobs walked into an ambush that killed dozens of his troops in just a few seconds. He responded by single-handedly fighting off repeated Viet Cong attacks. He overcame his own life-threatening injuries to make several trips through enemy fire to evacuate allied wounded. He saved 14 lives. His country decorated him with the Medal of Honor. More than 40 years later, Jacobs, a retired colonel, and his fellow Congressional Medal of Honor recipients are bringing their conspicuous gallantry to the cause of education. They are offering students priceless lessons in character, courage and selfless service. This time, Jacobs is asking for our help. In his current mission, Jacobs is raising money to endow the Medal of Honor Character Development Program. The program provides teacher training, video tools and lesson plans for schools to integrate character education into curricula. Medal of Honor recipients speak to students, in person or via teleconference. It's embarrassing that Medal of Honor recipients have to ask for support. We should be begging them to do it. Schools in 38 states are experimenting with the program. Early feedback is positive. Among participating teachers and students, overwhelming numbers say they would recommend the program to others. When asked the most important thing they learned, students report things like sacrifice, honor and courage. A remark from one student sums up what Jacobs and others are trying to get across, that Medal of Honor character lies within all of us. ""The people are 'normal' people,"" she said, referring to the Medal of Honor recipients, ""so it could be us that become heroes."" For a rigorous test, the Medal of Honor Foundation needs more secure footing for the program. So the Medal of Honor recipients, defined by history, have chosen to be obsessed with the future. ""We can't do anything about the past. It's gone. Maybe we can improve today, but we better move fast. It's almost gone,"" Jacobs said. ""Tomorrow is the only thing we can fix."" Jacobs knows about the past. On March 9, 1968, as a 22-year-old officer in Vietnam, he demonstrated a kind of heroism that only a few Americans know. His company commander was wounded in the ambush. Jacobs took command and repositioned the troops. The Medal of Honor citation explains the rest: . ""Despite profuse bleeding from head wounds which impaired his vision, Capt. Jacobs, with complete disregard for his safety, returned under intense fire to evacuate a seriously wounded advisor to the safety of a wooded area where he administered lifesaving first aid. He then returned through heavy automatic weapons fire to evacuate the wounded company commander. Capt. Jacobs made repeated trips across the fire-swept open rice paddies evacuating wounded and their weapons. On 3 separate occasions, Capt. Jacobs contacted and drove off Viet Cong squads who were searching for allied wounded and weapons, single-handedly killing 3 and wounding several others. His gallant actions and extraordinary heroism saved the lives of 1 U.S. advisor and 13 allied soldiers."" When President Nixon presented Jacobs with the Medal of Honor in October 1969, there were close to 400 living recipients. Today, there are 79. Vernon McGarity died May 21. The retired sergeant was 91. James Stone died in November. The retired first lieutenant was 90. William Charette, retired from the Navy, died in early 2012. He was 79. And so on. Jacobs will turn 68 in August. He can do the math. From the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, there are four living Medal of Honor recipients. The older ones, older men (one woman received the Medal of Honor, in 1861) from older wars, are facing a shared mortality, decades after many of their individual actions defied mortality. ""We feel the unrelenting press of time,"" Jacobs said. It is fitting that for their last act of service, these Medal of Honor recipients are fighting for the future of America's' children, not to memorialize their heroics. It is up to a private philanthropy, the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, to do what the government has not. We need to guarantee a future for the Character Development Program. It is our chance to hold on to the best of our nation. Jacobs, a foundation board member, believes that a $20 million endowment would secure the Character Development Program's future -- beyond the lives of the 79 living recipients. The urgency is real. With our collective resources, the price tag is a bargain. When I asked Jacobs to tell me about that day on the Mekong River back in March 1968, he demonstrated the kind of selflessness that distinguishes Medal of Honor recipients. ""You can look it up,"" he said, preferring to speak about the service of others, not his own experience. He shared the incredible story of another Medal of Honor recipient, Tibor Rubin, an Army corporal whose experience in a Chinese prison camp from 1950-53 carries unmatched lessons in character, courage and selfless service. You can look it up. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Bare.","John Bare: Medal of Honor recipients looking to share their view of character and courage .

"(CNN) -- U.S. kidnapping victim Jaycee Dugard, who gave birth to two children during her 18 years in captivity, said she did what she had to do to survive. During a wide-ranging interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer that aired on Sunday night, Dugard opened up about her experiences at the hands of her captors, Phillip and Nancy Garrido. Dugard was just 11 years old when she was abducted in 1991 from the street in front of her South Lake Tahoe, California, home. The Garridos held her and her daughters in a hidden compound of sheds and tarpaulins until she was found in 2009. Dugard is now 31 and working to build a new life, one in which she and her children are finally free. ""There's a switch that I had to shut off,"" she told Sawyer. ""Just went someplace else."" ""I can't imagine being beaten to death, you know? And you can't imagine being kidnapped and raped, you know? So, it's just, you just do what you have to do to survive."" Dugard recounted the first moment Phillip Garrido entered her life. She was on her way to school, wearing her favorite shirt and a ring in the shape of a butterfly her mother had given her, ABC reported, when all of a sudden Dugard felt ""tingly"" and ""numb."" Phillip had shocked her with a stun gun, the network said. The Garridos then put her in their car. She recalled Phillip laughing at one point, and telling his wife: ""I can't believe we got away with it."" ""It was like the most horrible moment of your life times 10,"" Dugard told ABC. At first, she was handcuffed. Dugard said she tried not to cry because, with her hands behind her back, she couldn't wipe away her tears. Left on her face, they would itch, she said. Dugard also recalled the first time she gave birth, in the backyard, at just 14 years old. ""I didn't know I was in labor,"" she said. ""Then I saw her. She was beautiful. I felt like I wasn't alone anymore. (I) had somebody that was mine ... And I knew I could never let anything happen to her,"" she said. Throughout her 18-year ordeal, Dugard managed to hold onto the ring her mother had given her and the hope that she would one day be reunited with her family, ABC reported. ""I wanted to see her more than anything,"" she said about her mother. ""I would cry every day. (It was) hardest when I would think about her and what she was doing and then -- trying to convince myself she was better without me. ""Worried I'd forget what she looked like, or what she sounded like. Would she forget me?"" Her mother, Terry Probyn, also appeared in the ABC interview. Last month, a judge sentenced Phillip Garrido to 431 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to one count of kidnapping and 12 counts of sexual assault. His wife Nancy Garrido got 36 years to life in prison for her role in the crimes, including kidnapping and one count of rape by force. The couple had pleaded guilty in late April in El Dorado Superior Court. A statement from Dugard, read by her mother at the sentencing hearing, called the Garridos ""evil"" and described her kidnapping by them as a ""sexual perversion."" During the ABC interview, she stressed she is moving on with her life. Dugard said she wants to study writing, the network reported. She spoke out just days before her memoir, ""A Stolen Life,"" is scheduled to be released. The book is due in stores on Tuesday. ""Why not look at it? Stare it down until it can't scare you anymore,"" Dugard said about her nearly two decades in captivity.

"(CNN) -- Here's a seriously depressing question: . If a polar bear no longer has ice to stand on and must have his ""bear kibble"" (that's a real term; more on it soon) airlifted to the Arctic by helicopter, is he still a polar bear? Or is he some sort of zoo-like experiment -- a sad but perhaps unavoidable consequence of an era of melting ice and warming climates? I posed a less-wordy version of that question to Andrew Derocher, a biologist and polar bear expert at the University of Alberta. He recently published a paper outlining several emergency actions that likely will have to be taken soon to save the Arctic bears. Among Derocher's scenarios is using helicopters to airdrop food on polar bears as their icy habitat continues to melt -- at a cost of $32,000 per day for the ""most accessible"" bears. (The hope is that such interventions would last days per year, not months). ""It's a lot better to have some animals in the wild even if they are being supplemented in their food. If we were basically the sole food source for these animals, then we're going to have some very serious issues. Then it won't really be a polar bear anymore,"" Derocher said on the phone. ""It will be a semi-wild, semi-captive, free-ranging carnivore. And it probably wouldn't do that well even if the ice started to come back"" since the bear would become so dependent on the airlifted food that he may forget how to hunt. (Sigh). It's really come to this. Derocher's paper, which appeared in the journal Conservation Letters, has been getting lots of attention because it outlines several last-ditch ideas for saving the polar bears, including feeding them bear chow, which, as one commercial website describes it, contains ""ground corn, porcine meat meal, fish meal (menhaden), dehulled soybean meal, corn gluten meal, ground soybean hulls, porcine animal fat preserved with BHA, dried beet pulp, soybean oil, taurine, salt"" and a bunch of stuff I can't pronounce. It's packaged sort of like cat food. His other ideas: Moving the bears northward, where the ice is less likely to melt; euthanizing some of the bears, which he writes ""may be the most humane option for individual bears in very poor condition that are unlikely to survive""; and moving some of the polar bears to zoos. None of those options is easy to stomach -- and not just because of the ""porcine meat meal."" Derocher knows that. He doesn't want to have to feed the polar bears, much less euthanize them. After 30 years of researching the Arctic bears, he's just being realistic. As the planet warms, thanks to our gas-guzzling cars and power-producing factories, the polar bear's frozen habitat is disappearing. Arctic sea ice has been declining at a rate of 13% per decade since 1979, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Many scientists expect summer sea ice to disappear in a matter of decades. Polar bears live and hunt from sea ice. If it's gone, they can't catch seals, which tend to stay far from land. And if the bears can't catch seals, they can't survive. There's no other way around it. Unless, maybe, you airdrop some food on them. But even then, something of the bear's essence is lost. ""It's ridiculous, human beings feeding polar bears. Polar bears are wild animals,"" James Eetoolook, vice president of an Inuit group in Canada's Nunavut told The Canadian Press. ""They're predators. They're hunters. Let them be."" ""I wouldn't say I'm 'against' it, just skeptical about how much good it will do to them,"" one commenter wrote on my Google+ page when I asked about the subject. ""I'm afraid that in our haste to do good we might do more harm in the long run."" It's easy to have a whiplash reaction: Don't feed the polar bears. It's very Yogi, as Derocher put it. But such plans, while tragic, may be unavoidable at this point. The fact that such an idea is even up for consideration should be a major wake-up call -- a reminder that climate change is real and happening now. While some of its effects are inevitable (some polar bear habitat absolutely will be lost, Derocher said), there are longer-term solutions that could help save some of the polar-bear-ness of the polar bear. Or at the very least, Derocher said, they're ideas that could save them from extinction. The solutions are all things you've heard before: cut carbon dioxide emissions, use less power, walk don't drive, live more efficiently. It's not rocket science (or, as one Twitter user recently suggested as a replacement for that phrase, ""it's not corporate income-tax law""), but it will take a huge amount of political will in the United States and elsewhere to make substantive changes. That seems to exist. In his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama called for action on climate change ""for the sake of our children and our future."" Some 35,000 people gathered in Washington last weekend to make similar points. Organizers said it was the largest demonstration of its kind in the United States. Meanwhile, none of the five countries with polar bears -- the United States, Norway, Russia, Canada or Greenland -- has a plan for responding to polar bear emergencies ""caused by nutritional stress,"" the scientists write in the recent paper, which is titled ""Rapid ecosystem change and polar bear conservation."" When we act and how may determine how quickly the species disappears. Current projections don't look good. Researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey have estimated that two-thirds of polar bears will be gone by 2050. For the Arctic ice melt to make sense, all you have to do is watch this YouTube video, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which shows the puny extent of sea ice in 2012 compared with the historical average. With all that as the backdrop, feeding polar bears doesn't sound so crazy, however sad and potentially irreversible it may be. And such programs do exist for other species, Derocher said, including California condors, black bears in Washington state and brown bears in Eastern Europe. ""We're at the point where we're going to be implementing some of these scenarios in some parts of the Arctic,"" he said, ""without doubt. ""Bears just aren't as fat as they used to be,"" he said, which makes them less able to live through low-sea-ice years. ""It's very clear when you look at the data and when you just look at the animals. A lot of them just don't have that much gas left in their tank."" I asked Derocher what drives him. He said he's not a sentimental person -- he doesn't get attached to an individual polar bear the way he does to his golden retriever. But when you're in the Arctic and you see how much the bears are struggling, it's hard not to care about them as a group -- to want to do something to preserve their wild power. ""I'm still optimistic that humans will decide to deal with greenhouse gases in a realistic fashion,"" he said. To illustrate why that's important, he pointed me to an online video that shows the death of a young polar bear cub. It's linked here but, as a Mother Jones writer put it, ""Be forewarned: this is graphic and ghastly."" I wouldn't watch it unless you absolutely feel the need to do so. What's more important is Derocher's reaction. For him, the video echoed his experiences in the Arctic, surveying bears that are struggling because of sea ice melt. ""When you watch that,"" he said, ""you have to, I think, be pretty hardhearted to think that maybe humans aren't treading a little too heavily on this planet.""

"(CNN) -- Because Nepal lacks the social safety net that exists in most Western nations, many children there have little choice but to live in prison when their parents are incarcerated. Since 2005, however, Pushpa Basnet has been working to get some of these kids out from behind prison walls. Basnet provides a day care program for children under 6, and she runs a home where dozens of kids have a chance to live a more normal life. Basnet and her group have helped more than 140 children of incarcerated parents. CNN asked for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean for the Early Childhood Development Center? Pushpa Basnet: I think this recognition has given importance to the welfare and upbringing of the children who will become responsible citizens of the country and the leaders of tomorrow. I hope that ECDC is soon able to expand its services so that it is able to accommodate more children who are still living behind prison walls. I also hope that children suffering from parental incarceration get attention globally and that governments are able to prioritize and put in place policies for the protection of the children and effectively implement them. It has opened doors and put us in the limelight. The recognition has brought in invaluable financial and moral support for ECDC to keep continuing its work to ensure that no child grows up in prison as a result of parental incarceration. CNN: What was the reaction when you found out you were a top 10 CNN Hero? Basnet: Being selected as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes was beyond my wildest imagination. I was numb to begin with and since then have been somewhat anxious, extremely ecstatic, deeply touched, tremendously grateful and filled with a renewed hope for the future. To be in the same platform as that of some of the world's most compassionate and driven people is an incredible honor, and I have to pinch myself every day to make sure I am not dreaming. CNN's acknowledgment means the world to me and to the ECDC family and reminds me that I am not alone in this fight. Who should be the CNN Hero of the Year? Cast your vote now! If it wasn't for the 8-month-old who had tugged my shawl and looked at me with such sadness and innocence during my field visit to a women's prison in Kathmandu, I might never have understood the horrifying reality of children growing up in prison nor done anything about it. Seven years later, SanuKanchi is a bright, loving 8-year-old living with her mother in Kathmandu, and I have a big family of 50 kids and a team of hard-working, compassionate staff helping me take care of them. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Basnet: The award money will go towards the construction of a new home known as the Butterfly Home. We have been solely depending on renting available buildings as shelter. The Butterfly Home has been a dream project meant to build a stable home for the kids that will eliminate the ongoing risks of eviction, fear of insane rent hikes, and ensure long-term security. My dream project is still in the planning stage, and I am determined to make it a reality. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Basnet: In Nepal, still inside prisons, children are living with their parents with no basic facilities. But we at ECDC are working to rescue them and give them a better life and help to reintegrate and rehabilitate with their parents after release from prison. We also further financially help the rehabilitated children's academic education and help them to pursue their further studies as they want. Read the full story on CNN Hero Pushpa Basnet: .

"(CNN) -- Ecuador remains the frontrunner in the Edward Snowden sweepstakes. Hong Kong let him go, neither ready to arrest him on behalf of the United States nor willing to let him stay. Russian authorities have played coy, looking to avoid open conflict with the United States but hardly forthcoming with any details. Even Cuba is in the mix, perhaps as a temporary detour on the way to somewhere else. But it is Ecuador, of all places, that appears consistently as the country most willing to openly challenge the United States, apparently not averse to allowing Snowden to land in Quito while considering a request for asylum. How do we understand the inability of the United States to capture a U.S. citizen who has been charged with espionage and no longer has a valid U.S. passport? Why won't anyone help the United States get this guy? And why does Ecuador in particular appear willing to embrace Edward Snowden and oppose the United States? Where on Earth could Snowden go next? Part of the explanation lies in the fact that the United States does not appear to be garnering much sympathy on this issue within the international community as a whole. China, Russia, Cuba and Ecuador are hardly alone in wanting to poke at the United States by helping Snowden. Foreign observers are much less interested in the relative virtues of Snowden (traitor? hero? refugee? attention-seeker?) and much more willing to focus on the actions of the U.S. government, which outside our borders tends to be understood as part of a long history of out-of-control surveillance by U.S. intelligence agencies. In this sense, the United States may have the law on its side when demanding the arrest of Snowden, but it does not, from the perspective of many foreign observers, have a moral leg to stand on. Our past use of covert surveillance at both home and abroad, combined with our current pursuit of an individual who exposed questionable surveillance programs, has meant that our attempts to capture Snowden, however sound legally, have been effectively undermined by our own moral bankruptcy within international circles (at least with respect to issues of surveillance, privacy, espionage, etc.). 4 options for the U.S. to get Snowden back . This perception is all the more pervasive in Latin America, where decades of U.S. support for repressive military dictatorships was enforced by a wide range of surveillance programs that were often permitted and justified by legal statutes. Still, why Ecuador? The prevailing explanation among U.S. pundits is that Edward Snowden and Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa are ""unlikely allies"" and thus Correa's stance has nothing to do with Snowden's actions or the fact the United States is pursuing him. In other words, it is all about scoring political points. This is too simplistic an explanation and relies on a misunderstanding of Correa and the leftward shift that has swept Latin America during the past 25 years. Snowden: I took job to gather evidence . Politicians are always looking to score political points, and Correa has certainly had his moments. But when Correa offered Wikileaks journalist Julian Assange asylum in 2012, he had relatively little to gain politically beyond raising his international profile. At the time, he was expected to easily win re-election (which he did), in large part because under his administration unemployment levels had reached record lows, public spending on education had more than doubled and medical care was more accessible than ever. This was despite the fact that Ecuador had been hit harder than almost any country in the region by the financial crisis of 2008. Correa pumped money into the economy, reformed the financial system, took control of the central bank and otherwise worked, however imperfectly, to build a government and economy that serves the interests of the people. Simply put, Correa's popularity insured that there was relatively little to be gained by taking on Assange in 2012. Quite the opposite, Correa's embrace of Assange produced an intense backlash by the media in Ecuador, which then amped up opposition during the election. Similarly, Correa will score relatively few political points by embracing Snowden in 2013. Correa's stance is best seen as a principled one. In broad terms, Correa's openness to Assange and Snowden, as well as his decision to close a U.S. military base in Ecuador, is part of an effort to deepen Ecuadorian sovereignty while strengthening Latin America's ability to limit the influence of the United States in the region. Opinion: Why U.S. is being humiliated by the hunt for Snowden . This is perfectly within the rights of an independent nation, even one that has historically followed the U.S. lead. More immediately, Correa's willingness to take on Snowden should be seen for what it is, as a refreshingly principled stand by a small country against a powerful nation engaged in what many see as the political persecution of one of its own citizens. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Striffler.","Ecuador seems willing to consider giving asylum to Edward Snowden .

"(CNN) -- This month, the world's political and business elite will converge on Europe's highest-altitude town for the annual talk-shop that is the World Economic Forum, held this year under the banner of ""resilient dynamism."" The theme, the conference's organizers make clear, is prescriptive rather than descriptive -- a clarion call to the world's leaders, rather than an endorsement of their responses to date in addressing the problems afflicting the global economy. ""The ... new reality that we face is a prolonged global economic malaise, particularly in major economies experiencing economic austerity,"" Klaus Schwab, the German economist who founded the World Economic Forum (WEF) in 1971, said in a statement. ""Future growth in this new context requires dynamism -- bold vision and even bolder action. Either attribute -- resilience or dynamism -- alone is insufficient."" While there has necessarily been plenty of resilience in evidence since the last time delegates gathered at the Swiss ski resort, their responses to major issues like the ongoing eurozone sovereign debt crises and the U.S.'s fiscal cliff could hardly be termed dynamic. Those issues are likely to be foremost in the minds of those deemed important enough to be admitted entrance to the event, considered one of the world's most exclusive. Attendance to Davos is strictly by invitation only, with only 2,600 ""white badges"" of attendance issued to representatives from more than 100 countries. Adding to the exclusivity is the hefty price tag to attend. While the white badges are free for invited representatives of certain groups -- heads of state, faith leaders, academics, social entrepreneurs, members of international organizations and news anchors -- for businesses, the cost of a ticket is approximately $20,000. Per-delegate costs can easily rise to double that once travel, accommodation and other expenses are factored in. Among the VVIPs on the guest list will be heads of state, royalty, the CEOs of global corporate giants and the heads of a veritable alphabet soup of international organizations. The delegates will have plenty to talk about. The WEF's own Global Risks 2013 report -- compiled from an annual survey of more than 1,000 experts and industry leaders -- offers a pessimistic outlook, saying the global community's ability to address significant challenges, such as global warming, is undermined by the continuing economic weakness plaguing major economies. It identifies income inequality and unsustainable government debts as the two issues most likely to have an effect on the global community over the coming decade, and warns of a major systemic financial failure as the most devastating potential outcome. That weakness in key economic zones is proving stubbornly difficult to remedy. In November, figures were released showing the eurozone has entered a double-dip recession, with the well-documented woes of Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Italy. Austerity, the bitter medicine that it was hoped would be the cure to Europe's economic malaise, has not only proved hugely unpopular, prompting millions of Europeans to take to the streets in coordinated mass protests in November -- it is also, in the eyes of many economic experts, not working. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde is among many leading figures who have called for a slowdown in the austerity measures, the impacts of which the organization's chief economist Olivier Blanchard has said were miscalculated. The only major respite for the eurozone has come courtesy of the ""Draghi effect."" In September, European Central Bank (ECB) president, Mario Draghi, pledged to buy unlimited amounts of short-term debt from struggling eurozone members, in an attempt to shore up the 17-nation currency bloc, provided they accept certain conditions. Nevertheless the pain remains severe in many parts of Europe, with Greece in particular enduring the agony of austerity and recession. Its economy is forecast to have contracted 6% in 2012. Meanwhile the prospect of a government bailout continues to hang over Spain, according to market watchers. Compounding the uncertainty surrounding the eurozone's fourth-largest economy is an upcoming referendum, to be held in 2014, on whether Catalonia -- the country's wealthiest and most industrialized region, containing 16% of the population and producing 19% of its wealth -- wants independence. Elsewhere in Europe, economists are predicting that Britain -- which is not a member of the eurozone -- will receive a downgrading of its AAA rating this year. That was the result for the United States, as it suffered the first ever downgrade of its AAA rating last year. Despite lawmakers eventually reaching a deal on the fiscal cliff, political divisions look set to remain an impediment to addressing ongoing financial issues, such as the debt ceiling. The U.S.'s borrowing has hit its legal limit of $16.394 trillion, prompting the Treasury to resort to ""extraordinary measures"" to ensure that the government can pay its bills. If the ceiling is not raised soon, the U.S. faces the risk of defaulting on payments. But despite the painful, drawn-out experience of the fiscal cliff negotiations, indications from political leaders suggest that political partisanship and brinkmanship over financial solutions are set to continue. And in the Arab world, the ramifications of a wave of upheaval that began two years ago is still playing out. Egypt -- the most populous Arab country, geopolitically significant for its relationship with Israel -- showed encouraging signs when it successfully held election for its first democratically elected leader. But President Mohamed Morsy's assumption of special powers --a move described by critics as ""dictatorial"" -- to push through an Islamist-framed constitution outraged secular and liberal groups, among others, triggering fresh waves of protest from Egyptians disenchanted with how the revolution had played out. The renewed unrest has scared investors, prompting a fresh round of selling of the Egyptian pound, which has hit a series of record lows. His constitution passed, Morsy now faces an economic battle: to tackle his country's low foreign reserves, 12% unemployment and a large budget deficit, and revive this geopolitically significant North African economy. The question here, as elsewhere, remains whether 2013 can truly represent a new dawn -- or whether delegates will return to their snowy enclave in Davos in 2014 to address the same set of intractable problems.","The world's political and business elite are gathering in Davos .

"(CNN) -- When she was very young, Kayla Avery was used to playing in the snow. But the former Boston resident hadn't seen much of the white stuff since she moved to Arizona more than a decade ago. She got a reminder Wednesday. ""We received a blizzard warning last night through the emergency broadcasting system. Most of us didn't believe it,"" she told CNN iReport. ""Most of the news reports said it probably wouldn't snow in the valley, and two hours later it was snowing."" Avery, a 19-year-old student at the University of Arizona, said the snow was still falling Wednesday afternoon. ""My brother and I were staring out the window saying, 'What? It's snowing in Tucson? That's not supposed to happen!' "" she said, adding that she's never seen this much snow in the area since her family moved there. Usually the area gets no more than a dusting of snow once a year. iReport: ""Blizzard"" in Tucson . The inch of snow also caused PGA Tour officials to postpone play at the World Golf Championships-Accenture Match Play Championship in nearby Marana, Arizona. The rare accumulation was all part of a massive winter storm that promises to blanket a huge swath of the nation in crazy weather, from 18 inches of snow or more in Kansas to thunderstorms and flooding along the Gulf Coast. Trouble for the next three days . In all, about 800,000 square miles in 18 states were under some form of watch or warning Wednesday related to a major storm pouring out of California and into the Central Plains and the Midwest, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. About 30 million people live in the covered areas, he said. One of the places that could be hit the hardest is Springfield, Missouri. Among the hazards expected there Wednesday: lightning, wind and ice, with a little snow and sleet thrown on top for good measure. The biggest threat of heavy snow lies in parts of Kansas, Nebraska and Missouri, with the possibility of whiteout conditions in some places, he said. Track winter weather across the U.S. In Kansas, where the storm had already started, the National Weather Service was predicting as much as 18 inches of snow. The agency said parts of Nebraska could see more than a foot of snow, with drifts making some roads impassable. CNN affiliate KSNW in Wichita reported that crews had treated roads Monday but no matter how much salt and sand they had spread, by Wednesday morning, primary roads were snow-packed and slick. Side streets were worse. There was a break in the weather that allowed crews to get out before the afternoon rush hour and clear some of the major thoroughfares, the station reported. Kansas State University announced on its website that Thursday classes were canceled. Forecasters were predicting as much as 2 inches of snow in St. Louis, with the precipitation turning into sleet and freezing rain Thursday. The conditions will have ""a significant impact on travel,"" the weather service warned. North of where the most snow will fall, Chicago could receive what would be its largest single snowfall of the year -- 4 inches, Miller said. The city usually gets up to 4 feet of snow a year. So far this year, only about a foot has fallen, he said. South of the snow belt, dangerously icy conditions are possible in parts of northern Arkansas and southern Missouri, he said. That includes Springfield, where windy conditions will precede the possibility of up to 3 inches of snow and sleet Thursday, with the possibility of a quarter of an inch or more of ice to boot. Heavy rains forecast . Elsewhere, severe thunderstorms moving in from the Gulf of Mexico are expected to dump from 2 to 6 inches of rain over New Orleans, Louisiana, and Montgomery, Alabama, according to CNN's weather center, before rolling up toward Atlanta. The torrential rains could lead to significant river flooding near the Gulf, as flood watches are still in effect from last week's heavy rains. Heavy winds, hail and tornadoes are possible, the National Weather Service says. Downpours are expected to continue into Friday. Travel delays . It was snowing Wednesday in Denver where almost a dozen inbound flights were canceled, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. More than 200 flights into or out of U.S. airports were canceled, the website said, with almost 175 already called off for Thursday. Kansas City International Airport posted a statement on its website advising passengers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. ""There is potential for more cancelled or delayed flights as the storm continues,"" the statement said. Flight Aware reported that more than 100 flights were affected at that airport. CNN Meteorologists Ivan Cabrera and Dave Hennen contributed to this report.","More than 200 U.S. flights canceled on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- The South African slum of Kliptown has long suffered from high rates of unemployment, crime and school dropouts, and the end of apartheid did little to change the situation. But hundreds of children are starting to find hope thanks to Thulani Madondo, who is changing the community through education. Madondo's nonprofit, the Kliptown Youth Program, provides free academic support, meals and after-school activities to more than 400 children living in the slum. CNN asked Madondo for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean for the Kliptown Youth Program? Thulani Madondo: It means we can continue to grow as an organization, and it has helped us educate people about the life that we live here. Kliptown is one of the very old communities around Soweto, but it's still lacking in things like schools, electricity, running water. We use communal bathrooms. But this doesn't stop the children in our program from continuing to believe in their dreams. The recognition has also taught us that through hard work everything is possible, but it has also brought us a big challenge: We should always be working hard, because we will never know who is watching us! CNN: What was the reaction when you found out you were a top 10 CNN Hero? Madondo: KYP people heard me shouting, and they wanted to know what was happening. I immediately told them that we have made it! They went straight to the computers to double-check. After that, we started singing our KYP songs, celebrating that we are part of history in the making for our country and continent. Tears fell from my eyes, thinking how proud my mom was going to be seeing her struggle paying off to the nation. And I was then touched when a colleague said this achievement is dedicated to my late brother, Xolani Dube, who passed away in April. More from CNN Heroes: Finding 'diamonds' in Paradise City . CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Madondo: Our plan is to build a computer lab, provide school uniforms for the year 2013 and buy a solar geyser (to heat water) for our kitchen. It will also help provide relevant training for our staff so that we can be more competent in the work that we do. We believe that is very important, so our team can also grow with the organization. We want to strengthen the programs that we have, especially the tutorial program. We've been visiting a number of educational institutions around Johannesburg to see how we can strengthen it, what resources and skills we need. For us to succeed, we need to make sure our tutorial program is strong. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Madondo: The most important thing that I would like people to know about KYP is that it is an organization that is community-needs driven, and it is led by the youth of Kliptown that want to break the poverty cycle that has existed for many decades. This will be done through formal and nonformal education, where people will be empowered in things they are good at. ... We believe that if people are guided to what they are interested in, that is setting them up for success. Read the full story on CNN Hero Thulani Madondo: .

"London (CNN) -- European leaders have warned Britain against the dangers of cherry-picking European Union policy after David Cameron announced Britain would hold a referendum on its European Union membership if his Conservative Party is re-elected in 2015. Ahead of the British prime minister's speech, U.S. President Barack Obama had also advised Cameron that the United States valued Britain's membership of the European bloc. However, Cameron used Wednesday's speech in central London to say Britons should have a choice about whether to remain in the EU on the basis of a renegotiated settlement. He promised to hold a referendum by the end of 2017. Read more: Cameron promises referendum on Britain's place in Europe . After Cameron's speech, the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz tweeted: ""#Cameron's Europe a la carte not an option. We have to focus on jobs & growth rather than getting lost in treaties discussions."" ""We need a #UK as a fully fledged member not harboring in the port of Dover. UK can shape #EU by working with its partners,"" the German politician said. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius used similar language in an interview on France Info radio saying Europe could not be ""a la carte,"" Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported. ""Imagine the EU was a football club: once you've joined up and you're in this club, you can't then say you want to play rugby,"" it quoted him as saying. ""It risks being dangerous for Britain itself because Britain outside of Europe, that will be difficult,"" Fabius said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters that being part of Europe involved compromise. ""Europe also always means that you have to find fair compromises. In this context, we are of course ready also to talk about British wishes but one must keep in mind that other countries also have other wishes,"" Merkel said. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told reporters his country wanted Britain ""to remain an active and constructive part of the European Union"" and warned against ""cherry-picking."" ""We strive to create a better Europe, the European Union becoming even stronger with overcoming the debt crisis and regaining global competitiveness,"" AFP quoted him as saying. ""We share a common destiny in challenging times of globalization. And in challenging times of globalization, we as Europeans, we are all in the same boat."" iReport: Do you think Britain should stay in the EU? EU Commission spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen told it was ""very much in the EU's interest and UK's interest"" that London remain ""an active member."" Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore said Britain's membership of the EU was in both parties' best interests. ""And as far as Ireland is concerned, because of our close connections with Britain, we want to see Britain as a fully engaged member of the EU,"" the Press Association (PA) quoted him as saying. Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt warned against trying ""hold the EU to ransom."" The leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe in the European Parliament said Cameron's speech was ""filled with inconsistencies"" and showed ""a degree of ignorance about how the EU works."" ""By holding out the prospect of renegotiating the terms of Britain's membership of the EU and subjecting it to a referendum, David Cameron is playing with fire. ""He can control neither the timing nor the outcome of the negotiations and in so doing is raising false expectations that can never be met."" Obama last week told Cameron that ""the United States values a strong UK in a strong European Union."" Philip Gordon, the U.S. assistant secretary for European affairs, also made it clear that there would be consequences for Britain if it either left the EU or played a lesser role in Brussels. ""We have a growing relationship with the EU as an institution, which has an increasing voice in the world, and we want to see a strong British voice in that EU,"" he told reporters at the U.S. Embassy in London. ""That is in America's interests. We welcome an outward-looking EU with Britain in it."" The New York Times reported Wednesday that the implications of Cameron's speech had ""alarmed"" the Obama administration and were likely to set up ""a divisive debate within Britain and across Europe."" Deutschewelle's Europe Editor Joanna Impey wrote that leaving the EU would ""not insulate the UK from the crisis in the eurozone."" ""The EU is Britain's biggest trading partner, and it makes sense to remain within the bloc and to be able to make the rules rather than simply abide by them,"" she said. But Impey added that the Conservative Party would need to be re-elected for the referendum to go ahead. A Downing Street spokeswoman said criticism of Cameron's referendum plan could be expected. ""But it is not always our job to worry about what the foreign ministers are saying,"" she told PA. ""It is our job to worry about what the British people are saying."" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg -- whose Liberal Democrat party is in coalition with Cameron's Conservatives -- told PA a referendum was not in the national interest. In Britain's House of Commons, Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband said he was opposed to an in/out referendum. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking at the Davos summit, told Sky News he did not see ""a compelling reason"" to put the question of Britain's EU membership on the agenda. ""Europe does need Britain and Britain needs Europe,"" Blair said. ""Why say we're actually going to put on the agenda the prospect of leaving Europe altogether?""","UK PM David Cameron promises to hold a referendum on EU membership by 2017 .

"(CNN) -- Wanda Butts lost her teenage son in a drowning accident six years ago, and ever since then she has been working to change a troubling statistic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, African-American children between the ages of 5 and 14 drown at a rate almost three times higher than white children in the same age range. Since 2007, Butts and her nonprofit, the Josh Project, have helped nearly 1,200 children -- most of them minorities -- learn how to swim. CNN asked Butts for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. CNN: What was the reaction when you found out you were a top 10 CNN Hero? Wanda Butts: Shock and unbelief! I was thinking that this could not be happening to me, just as I felt back on August 6, 2006, when I was told that Josh had drowned. I never would have thought that anything good would happen from the drowning death of my only son at the age of 16. I saw nothing but disaster and tragedy from Josh's drowning. But now I see all of the positive outcomes from his death. Now I can see better what the plan was for my son's life and death, and mine. His death was so others could have a fuller life and possibly a longer life because of their knowing how to swim and (having) water safety skills. His death from drowning gave my life meaning because I can now share with others the importance of knowing how to swim and the importance of knowing water safety. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean for the Josh Project? Butts: I would like (to raise) awareness of our mission and our focus of parents being educated and knowing the importance of their child knowing how to swim and how to be safe in and around water. I would hope that the public will be more aware about drowning prevention, especially in communities where the drowning statistics are much higher and more likely to happen. Our objective is to change the drowning statistics. Drowning is preventable if you know the rules. Awareness, education and knowledge is key. That was something I did not have. Who should be the CNN Hero of the Year? Cast your vote now! CNN: What are some of your goals or plans for the Josh Project? Butts: To increase enrollment, employ our own teachers and have our own swimming facility so students can practice what they learn in their weekly lessons. And possibly increase lessons to twice a week. We also intend to increase our water safety education classes. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Butts: Swimming and water safety education are basic life skills that all should know. Water is universal. And since our Earth is nearly 70% water and our bodies are 60 to 70% water and swimming is the only sport that could possible save your life, it is very vital for everyone to have water safety skills and know how to swim.

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- Five hundred kids screamed when singer Ne-Yo walked in on their holiday party on a recent Saturday bearing gifts and a message of hope. ""This is the first famous person I actually met,"" exclaimed Tha Banks, 16, with a huge smile. Banks, a sports fan, got a new football autographed by the R&B superstar. Banks isn't Ne-Yo's typical fan -- he and the other teens at the party are part of Florida's foster care system, all seeking a life free from neglect and abuse. For the past five years, Shaffer ""Ne-Yo"" Smith has visited underprivileged children across the country, bringing toys, games, shoes and clothing as part of his charity's annual ""giving tour."" Ne-Yo and his mother, who is president of his foundation, recently visited six cities in six days, bringing Christmas gifts to more than 3,000 kids at Boys and Girls clubs, group homes and in foster care. He also talks to the children about his personal experiences. ""I grew up pretty much like you all,"" Ne-Yo told the teens at the central Florida foster home. ""We didn't have a lot of anything ... there was no silver spoon in my mouth."" A father of two himself, Ne-Yo said he sees his children in the faces of the kids he meets at these events. ""It's hard for me to fathom any parent that would abandon their kids for whatever reason,"" said Ne-Yo, the father of a 1-year-old and a 3-month-old. ""That doesn't compute with me."" The holiday party was organized by the Kids House of Seminole County, which cares for 2,300 kids each year between the ages of 3 and 18, including victims of neglect, and others who witness domestic violence, or experience physical or sexual abuse, according to Marcie Dearth of Kids House. ""This is an annual party that kids host every year, but we never have had the celebrity presence that we did this year,"" Dearth said, calling Ne-Yo's visit ""a lifetime experience."" The kids frost cookies and decorate stockings for the holiday season -- a tough time for these children, who are separated from their families. ""These events help fill that void, that excitement of the holiday spirit that all kids should have,"" said John Cooper, assistant secretary of operations for the Florida Department of Children and Families. More than 400,000 children are in the foster care system in the United States, according to a 2010 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report. With about 19,000 kids in foster care, Florida has the fourth-largest number of kids in state care, behind California, New York and Texas, according to the 2010 report. At the party, volunteers handed out wrapped presents donated by Ne-Yo's charity, the Compound Foundation; Toys for Tots; Coca-Cola; Mattel; Ubisoft and other corporate partners. Destiny Molina, 15, unwraps her gift: a box filled with bottles of nail polish. ""You know what's funny,"" she says. ""The girls at the other (foster) house stole my other nail polish, and I have been trying to buy it back."" She turns to her friend to ask what she got. ""Makeup,"" replies Karla Hurtado, 16. ""Oh that's cute,"" Molina says. Molina said this was going to be a good Christmas, something that doesn't happen every year for children in foster care. ""We don't have Christmases like this all the time,"" she said, a little choked up. Ne-Yo told the room full of kids that he was living, breathing proof that you need to find something that you love to do and ""stick with it."" He said something that motivates yet frustrates him is hearing foster kids referred to as ""forgotten children."" ""All you need for success is drive, passion and one person to give a damn -- to give you a shot,"" Ne-Yo said. ""And you have a room full of people like that."" Mercedes Noble, 17, says she was grateful to meet Ne-Yo, who she said seemed to be a real person, just like her. The tall teen said foster care is not the best place to be at Christmas; everyone would rather be with their families. Noble said, though, ""It's way better to be here with people who love and care for us than be at home and probably getting beat."" With a big smile, the teen said, ""I appreciate that he took time out of his life and come and show respect to us, kindness -- let us know that we are still human, we are still people and we still need love.""","R&B star Ne-Yo brought holiday gifts to foster kids in six cities .
He and his mother run a foundation that helps underprivileged kids .
Ne-Yo, a father of two, tells the kids he also grew up without a lot of opportunities ."
"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- The violin she uses is cheap by most standards: made in China, it costs about $150. But that's an absolute fortune for Yanca Leite. On the day we visited her, the 15-year-old aspiring musician couldn't even afford breakfast. Yanca shares a one-bedroom shack with eight relatives in a sprawling shantytown on the outskirts of Sao Paulo called Paraisopolis, or Paradise City. The narrow path leading to their door is lined with the bottles and cans they collect to supplement their income. ""The guy who recycles these bottles didn't pick them up and pay us,"" Yanca said. ""So we didn't have money to buy bread."" Yanca rarely sees her father, who is in and out of jail, or her mother, a live-in maid who she says is working hard so her kids can get out of the slums. But Yanca thinks she has finally discovered her own way out: music. Less than a year ago, she joined a new classical music project at the Paraisopolis cultural center. Each student is given a violin and offered free -- yet very intensive -- classes once a week. ""Music has changed my life,"" she said. ""I study eight hours a day all of the instruments I have at home: violin, guitar and keyboard."" The program was dreamed up by Joao Carlos Martins, an acclaimed classical pianist whose career was cut short by injury. He reinvented himself as a successful composer, and seven years ago he went to one of Brazil's notorious favelas, or slums, in search of raw talent. ""I discovered so many naturally talented children that I decided to build a project,"" he said. ""In 10 years, I intend to build 1,000 string orchestras in underprivileged areas across our country."" According to the latest census, more than 11 million Brazilians are living in favelas, many of them without access to running water or sewage systems. And there are more than a billion people living in slums worldwide, according to Amnesty International. Across all continents, there are hundreds of millions of children who lack access to electricity, clean water and education despite living in cities with modern facilities and technology. ""One in three urban dwellers lives in slum conditions; in Africa, the proportion is a staggering six in 10,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake in a report this year called ""The State of the World's Children"" (PDF). ""The impact on children living in such conditions is significant. ""From Ghana and Kenya to Bangladesh and India, children living in slums are among the least likely to attend school. And disparities in nutrition separating rich and poor children within the cities and towns of sub-Saharan Africa are often greater than those between urban and rural children."" Thulani Madondo is all too familiar with that. Madondo, one of this year's top 10 CNN Heroes, grew up in a South African slum where he and his siblings felt like they had no control over their future. His older siblings dropped out of school because of financial pressure, and he had to wash cars and work as a stock boy just so he could stay in school. Madondo eventually became the first person in his family to graduate from high school. Now he's giving back to the youth in Kliptown, the slum where he was raised. He helped start the Kliptown Youth Program, which provides academic support, meals and after-school activities to 400 disadvantaged children. ""We didn't want to see other young people going through what we'd gone through: no uniforms ... feeling hungry in class,"" Madondo said. ""We know the problems of this community, but we also know the solutions."" By giving children education and encouragement, the idea is that the children will feel empowered and go on to become successful, productive members of society -- instead of becoming disillusioned and falling into gangs or a life of crime. ""We want them to realize there's something they can contribute to this world. ... We're trying to give them the sense that everything is possible,"" Madondo said. Photos: Making charcoal in a Manila slum . In Brazil, Martins says his music classes help fight crime, not only by getting youth off the streets, but by giving them the tools that could lead to jobs -- and salaries -- their parents never dreamed of. ""For some, (music) gives them a hobby,"" he said. ""For others, it gives them a profession, like a wedding performer. And finally, there are the diamonds"" who go on to be professional musicians. But Martins says he has had to overcome sometimes unexpected difficulties. ""When one child took his violin to his house, his father sold his violin,"" he said. Nonetheless, many of the first students Martins took under his wing are already working as musicians and music teachers. And the Paraisopolis students who gather every Thursday are enthusiastic about their future. Yanca has a modest dream to become a music teacher for other slum children like herself. ""I play with all my heart,"" she says, breaking down in tears. ""If it weren't for music, I'd be a drug addict or a prostitute or out robbing. Because that's the reality here.""

"(CNN) -- This year's top 10 CNN Heroes are working hard to make a difference in the world, and you can help by donating to their causes through Google. Google is waiving all transaction fees so that each Hero's designated nonprofit gets 100% of the funds. These donations are also tax-deductible in the United States. To learn more about each nonprofit and where your money would go, here are the top 10 Heroes in alphabetical order: . Pushpa Basnet . Nonprofit: Early Childhood Development Center . What it does: Gives dozens of children in Nepal a place to live while their parents are incarcerated. Many children in Nepal actually have to live behind bars with their parents because there's nowhere else to go and there isn't an adequate social safety net. Basnet's group also provides a day care program for young children who live in prison. Basnet says: ""I hope that ECDC is soon able to expand its services so that it is able to accommodate more children who are still living behind prison walls. ... We are working to rescue them and give them a better life."" Donate to the Early Childhood Development Center . Wanda Butts . Nonprofit: The Josh Project . What it does: Provides low-cost swimming lessons for hundreds of children in Toledo, Ohio. Most of the children in the program are minorities like Butts, who lost her 16-year-old son because he didn't know how to swim. Statistics show that minority children in the United States are more likely to drown than white children. Butts says: ""Our objective is to change the drowning statistics. Drowning is preventable if you know the rules. Awareness, education and knowledge are key. That was something I did not have."" Donate to the Josh Project . Mary Cortani . Nonprofit: Operation Freedom Paws . What it does: Helps U.S. war veterans train their own service dogs. Many Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans are suffering from invisible wounds such as post-traumatic stress disorder, and some of them are finding it easier to cope thanks to canine companions. Cortani says: ""Being a veteran myself, I understand loss of purpose, the mission. Training their own service dog gives them that and more. It gives them a shot at a quality life again."" Donate to Operation Freedom Paws . Catalina Escobar . Nonprofit: Juan Felipe Gomez Escobar Foundation . What it does: Provides counseling, education and job training to more than 2,000 teenage mothers in Colombia, where one in five girls age 15-19 is or has been pregnant. The group also runs a medical center that has brought health care to tens of thousands of children whose families couldn't otherwise afford it. Escobar says: ""I want my girls to be empowered. Earning money provides them with independence and allows them to gain back control of their lives."" Donate to the Juan Felipe Gomez Escobar Foundation . Razia Jan . Nonprofit: Razia's Ray of Hope . What it does: Operates a free school for girls in Afghanistan, where many terrorists will stop at nothing to keep girls from getting an education. There were at least 185 documented attacks on schools and hospitals in Afghanistan last year, according to the United Nations. The majority were attributed to armed groups opposed to girls' education. Jan says: ""It took a lot of determination and courage to build the first girls school in an area where the girls did not count. Now, with hard work, I have proven to the men of seven villages surrounding the school that this is the best thing that's happened for their daughters."" Donate to Razia's Ray of Hope . Thulani Madondo . Nonprofit: Kliptown Youth Project . What it does: Provides academic support, including tutoring, meals and school uniforms, to 400 children who live in the slums of Kliptown, South Africa. Kliptown has long suffered from high rates of unemployment, crime and school dropouts. Madondo says: ""(We) want to break the poverty cycle that has existed for many decades. This will be done through formal and nonformal education, where people will be empowered in things they are good at. ... We believe that if people are guided to what they are interested in, that is setting them up for success."" Donate to the Kliptown Youth Program . Leo McCarthy . Nonprofit: Mariah's Challenge . What it does: Gives college scholarships to teenagers who pledge not to drink while they're underage. Nearly $150,000 in scholarship money has been awarded by the group, which started after McCarthy's 14-year-old daughter Mariah was killed by an underage drunken driver in Butte, Montana. McCarthy says: ""I want this to be a platform for people to say: 'OK, I don't want to be like that guy who killed Mariah. But I need some help, because I'm getting group pressure.' ... I'm not asking you to say no to drugs. I'm asking you to say yes to yourself and a life of simple self-respect."" Donate to Mariah's Challenge . Connie Siskowski . Nonprofit: American Association of Caregiving Youth . What it does: Supports young people who have to take care of an ill, disabled or aging family member. Since 2006, the group has provided assistance to more than 550 young caregivers in Palm Beach County, Florida. Siskowski says: ""We're not advocating that children should do this or be in this position, but they are. So we want to make it as safe as possible and arm them with the knowledge base that they need."" Donate to the American Association of Caregiving Youth . Scott Strode . Nonprofit: Phoenix Multisport . What it does: Provides free athletic activities and a sober support community to more than 6,000 participants in Colorado. It offers dozens of programs every week, from casual walks and yoga to mountain biking and ice climbing. Strode says: ""Phoenix Multisport prides itself on our ability to help recovering addicts and alcoholics repair their self-esteem. Many of us in recovery had our dreams stripped away during our alcohol and drug use. The Phoenix Multisport community helps give those dreams back through standing on top of mountains and crossing finish lines."" Donate to Phoenix Multisport . Malya Villard-Appolon . Nonprofit: KOFAVIV (a Creole acronym that translates into the Commission of Women Victims for Victims) What it does: Offers safety, medical care and legal aid to rape victims in Haiti. Gender-based violence has been an issue in Haiti for years, according to Villard-Appolon, and her group has seen an increase in rape cases since the 2010 earthquake. Villard-Appolon says: ""We tell people to come out of silence. Do not be afraid to say that you have been victimized."" Donate to KOFAVIV .","The top 10 CNN Heroes are tackling important issues, and they need your help .
You can donate to their causes through Google, which is waiving all transaction fees ."
"(CNN) -- Although a massive earthquake destroyed her home and her office in January 2010, Malya Villard-Appolon has been relentless in her efforts to support rape victims in Haiti. Villard-Appolon is a rape survivor herself. In 2004, she established KOFAVIV, an organization that helps other survivors find safety, medical care and legal aid. Since the earthquake, she and her group have helped more than 1,400 women. CNN asked Villard-Appolon for her thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean for KOFAVIV? Villard-Appolon: It's an opportunity for people to know the situation in Haiti -- for women, especially. We feel that (this) will allow KOFAVIV to reach out to more women and provide more support. Haiti is a country where many of the women are victims. For me, this is a huge thing. I was raped in 1992 and in 2003; I survived an attempted rape in 2010. My daughter was raped. And yet in the face of the problems in our country, I gave my entire life for this project. This will enable me to continue to fight, and I hope it brings about a change for my country. CNN: What was your reaction when you found out that you'd been selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Villard-Appolon: I knew it was something special. When we found out, all the victims mobilized, and it was a victory for them. This gives encouragement to me and our outreach agents to continue to serve other women and girls who are victims. More from CNN Heroes: Living in fear ""under the tent"" CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Villard-Appolon: We will use a portion of it so we can help the children. We have a lot of children that we are helping in education. (An) organization that was sponsoring a school could no longer pay to keep up the school. We would take the children we are working with already and work on finding a school that they can attend. The money will give us the opportunity to help the children not lose a full year and get an education. When children don't have an education, it becomes a problem for everyone. Secondly, (it will) help in hiring security guards, for improving security for those involved with KOFAVIV. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Villard-Appolon: There is too much violence in Haiti. I want people in the United States to know the work that KOFAVIV is doing to combat corruption. We are fighting for the women and children who, after the earthquake, became victims. We are fighting for justice. Read the full story on CNN Hero Malya Villard-Appolon: .

"(CNN) -- Leo McCarthy gives college scholarships to teenagers who pledge not to drink while they're underage. In 2007, McCarthy lost his 14-year-old daughter, Mariah, when an underage drunken driver hit her and two of her friends as they walked down a sidewalk near her home in Butte, Montana. Through McCarthy's nonprofit, Mariah's Challenge, more than 140 teenagers have received $1,000 scholarships. CNN asked McCarthy for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean for Mariah's Challenge? McCarthy: It's a very quiet sense of pride for this town. We have such a hard history of living here. ... (We use) the term ""Butte tough."" Now, it's more about character and strength, about growing old and helping our youth to grow old. People come up and say, ""Hey, congratulations."" And some kid said, ""I am Mariah's Challenge."" And that totally blew me away. So, it's formulating to them that it's really them, not me, that are seen in CNN Heroes. To them, it's growing up by changing this situation a generation at a time. We're seeing this in sixth-graders coming up; they automatically know about Mariah's Challenge. They automatically know that they're not supposed to drink for four years in high school. So, will they? I don't know. But hey, it's a better start than it was prior to October 27, 2007. And it's a great honor for parents and youth that are sitting at the table and talking about it. It just gives parents more power to say: ""Hey, this is a good deal. Let's talk about it. What's going on in your life?"" So, (the CNN recognition) is a validation of the three girls, and it's a validation of the tool that parents can use at the dinner table. The dinner table is the most powerful place in the world. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? McCarthy: (It) will provide at least 40 scholarships, hopefully this year, that we're going to immediately give out to courageous youth. Also, the money is going to be used to start our Mariah's Education Initiative for the local elementary and junior highs. Basically, it's going to be a template for teachers to use to assist (the students) in empowerment, honesty, integrity and character. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? McCarthy: It's about making sure that our youth have an option and a tool to talk to their parents and their loved ones about what's going on in their life. This is such an in-your-face situation because it stole the innocence of our town when three 14-year-old girls were basically mowed down a half a block from my house, on a pedestrian pathway. That innocence was shaken in this town. I want this to be a platform for people to say, ""OK, I don't want to be like that guy who killed Mariah. But I need some help, because I'm getting group pressure."" And I hope that it's a way for them to choose ""yes"" instead of ""no."" I'm not asking you to say ""no"" to drugs. I'm asking you to say ""yes"" to yourself and a life of simple self-respect. That's all it is. CNN: We're coming up on the five-year anniversary of Mariah's death. What does the timing of this honor mean to you? McCarthy: Surreal, going back to those lonely, sleepless nights after it happened and trying to make sense of this. Stumbling and bumbling about, realizing it's got to be up to me and my family to try to bring something out of this and always believing about the legacy of love ... and seeing it now. It would have been so easy to build a monument to misery and light the torch of vengeance. ... But we decided to go the tough way, the hard way, which is acknowledging we can all be better and we can always bring good out of bad. There is grace in that, and there is deep peace in that.

"(CNN) -- The worst of a brutal winter storm may be over for many, but plenty of residents of the Great Plains and Kansas City still were coping Tuesday with its effects. Ice and falling branches downed power lines, cutting electricity to tens of thousands of people. And the heavy, wet snow made getting around difficult, whether by car or by foot. A CNN crew driving through Kansas City saw very few other drivers, and those who were out were taking their time. Residents, hit by back-to-back snow storms, just want a break. ""It's been a long, what, seven days, 10 days, something like that,"" Kansas City resident and snow shoveler Lindsey Hughes said. ""I'm ready to go home."" The storm is weakening as it moves to the Northeast and the moisture is being stolen by the rain, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""This is great news,"" Myers said. ""The rain is taking the moisture out of the storm and taking the punch out of what could be the snow part of the storm, and it's raining out rather than snowing out."" That means areas hit with snow Tuesday won't see accumulations like portions of Texas, northwest Oklahoma and southern Kansas got Monday. Rain was falling Tuesday afternoon over much of the Midwest. There likely will be snow all day in Chicago, Myers said. More than 330 flights at O'Hare International Airport and 170 at Midway International Airport were canceled Tuesday. The storm is far from done. About 45 million people in 21 states were under some form of winter weather watch, warning or advisory. ""This storm is still a very active and dangerous storm, from Michigan into western New York and the mountains in New England are getting hit with very heavy snows, said Louis Uccellini, director of the National Weather Service. The cold air associated with the system will linger on the East Coast through the weekend, he said. But to the west, piling snow damaged buildings Tuesday in Kansas and Missouri. In Shawnee, Kansas, the roof of a horse arena collapsed under the weight of snow Tuesday morning, CNN affiliate KSHB reported. It was one of several such collapses in the region because of the wet heavy snow, the station said. No injuries were reported in those collapses, but a person died Monday in a roof collapse in hard-hit Woodward, Oklahoma, said Mayor Roscoe Hill. Two other deaths came in Kansas on Monday in separate weather-related accidents on Interstate 70. One accident happened in Sherman County and the other in Ellis County, the Kansas National Guard said. More than 56,000 customers in Kansas and Missouri were without power Tuesday afternoon, the Kansas National Guard said. The bulk of the outages -- 45,000 -- were in the Kansas City region straddling the border between Kansas and Missouri. Most flights out of Kansas City International Airport were canceled. Roads were still snow-covered, but improving, in northwestern Missouri, the state Department of Transportation said on Twitter. The agency continued to discourage travel. Forecasters expected the storm to bring up to a foot of snow to parts of eastern Kansas, Missouri and Illinois a day after plastering southern Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Winter storm watches and warnings or weather advisories stretched from Oklahoma to Michigan. About 6 inches of snow fell in Mediapolis in southeastern Iowa, CNN iReporter Rose Schmidgall said. The high school student spent much of the day shoveling snow. ""The digging was difficult and took a little while. The snow was packed really good and was heavy to scoop,"" she said, adding her family still had power as of Tuesday afternoon. Track the storm . While the back-to-back snowstorms were frustrating for some, others put a positive spin on the experience. Jim Service of Overland Park, Kansas, spaced out the work of clearing last week's snowfall over four days. He finished Sunday, just in time for this storm. After a warm-up session clearing Tuesday's snow -- much wetter and heavier than last week's -- he retreated inside with a Clive Cussler novel and planned to enjoy the day off. Like many others, Service's company called off work Tuesday at the behest of state officials who warned that the storm was too dangerous for people to be on the roads. ""It's great for me,"" he said. The Kansas National Guard warned that continued snowfall and gusty winds would make travel tricky through Wednesday. In Woodward, emergency vehicles were still having trouble getting around Tuesday, a day after the storm dropped more than 15 inches of snow. Crews dispatched to a house fire Monday had trouble reaching the home because of 4-foot snowdrifts. The snowplow sent to free the firefighters also got stuck. Even Tuesday, emergency vehicles still were having a tough time getting around. ""We're in such a mess,"" said Hill, the mayor. Whiteout conditions . The storm follows one last week that paralyzed a broad swath of the Plains and Midwest with more than a foot of snow. Portions of Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and other states were affected. The storm prompted a state of emergency declaration in Kansas and parts of Oklahoma, bringing whiteout conditions to southern parts of those states and Texas. Schools in Wichita, Kansas, were closed Tuesday for a fourth straight day after last week's storm, which dumped a record 14.2 inches on the city. Wichita has received 21 inches of snow in February, breaking a record that had stood for 100 years, the National Weather Service said. And it all fell in the past six days. Are you there?

"(CNN) -- Through sports, Scott Strode was able to overcome his addiction to drugs and alcohol. He worked out in a boxing gym, got involved with triathlons and climbing, and made new friends who supported him through his transition. Encouraged by his success, Strode wanted to help others deal with their own addiction. So in 2007, he started a nonprofit, Phoenix Multisport. Phoenix Multisport has provided free athletic activities and a sober support community to more than 6,000 participants in Colorado. It offers dozens of programs every week, from casual walks and yoga to mountain biking and ice climbing. CNN asked Strode for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012. CNN: What do you hope this recognition will mean for Phoenix Multisport? Scott Strode: My hope is that sharing this story on the national stage will help Phoenix Multisport reach the angel donors that we need to support our current work and help us expand nationally. More than 23 million people over the age of 12 in the U.S. are struggling with addiction and need treatment. Of those, only about 10% get treatment. When I got sober, I was alone and didn't know what to do. I knew I couldn't go back to using or I was going to die. Finding others living a sober, healthy lifestyle and finding hope and happiness in sobriety were gifts that saved my life. I knew I had to give this gift to others. There are millions out there in the dark days of their addiction, alone, trying to figure out how to stay alive. I hope that sharing my story and the story of Phoenix Multisport does two things. First, I want those who are addicted and those who love them to know they are not alone and that there is hope. Second, everyone knows someone who has struggled with addiction. It may be your mother, cousin, friend, co-worker, admired athlete, movie star or musician, but we are all well aware of how bad things can get when addiction takes over. It is my hope that by sharing this story on the national stage, people will realize recovery is possible. Who should be the CNN Hero of the Year? Cast your vote now! Phoenix is only in existence because of the support we receive from donors. It is my ultimate hope that this amazing opportunity allows us to reach donors who can help us create a sober active community in cities and towns across the nation. By supporting Phoenix Multisport financially, donors can make recovery possible for millions nationally and we can break the cycle of addiction so future generations don't have to grow up under the shadow of alcoholism or drug addiction. CNN: What was the reaction when you found out you were a top 10 CNN Hero? Strode: I was deeply moved. (Our) staff and supporters have been working so hard for several years to help build the Phoenix Multisport sober active community. Telling the successes of this story I believe will help rally other supporters around us, allowing Phoenix Multisport to reach thousands more with our programs. (We) and our supporters were overjoyed by the acknowledgement of our work. So rarely is the recovery side of addiction discussed in the media, so Phoenix Multisport felt honored to share the telling of this story of recovery and hope with CNN and its audience. CNN: How will you use the $50,000 award you receive for being selected as a top 10 CNN Hero? Strode: Phoenix Multisport has always had the goal of having chapters in cities across the country. And with this recognition from CNN, we believe this dream will come true, allowing Phoenix's programs to reach others battling the darkness of addiction. We believe that recovery heals individuals and families. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Strode: Phoenix Multisport prides itself on our ability to help recovering addicts and alcoholics repair their self-esteem. Many of us in recovery had our dreams stripped away during our alcohol and drug use. The Phoenix Multisport community helps give those dreams back through standing on top of mountains and crossing finish lines. We also help those in recovery let go of some of the shame associated with their addiction by wearing a Phoenix T-shirt or bike jersey. It makes a statement that ""I'm a better person today because I'm sober, and if you are out there struggling with addiction, we are here for you."" Read the full story on CNN Hero Scott Strode: .

"(CNN) -- ""I have rights. I have the right of education,"" Malala Yousufzai boldly asserted during an interview with CNN last year. Now the 14-year-old girl from Pakistan is slowly recovering after being shot in the head by the Taliban for blogging against them and defending the right of girls to go to school. Her plight has inspired people far beyond her home in the Taliban-heavy Swat Valley. Large crowds are rallying around the world to show support for Yousufzai and her cause. Before the attack, Yousufzai was in the process of starting a charity, the Malala Education Development Organization, to promote female education in northern Pakistan. Other organizations are also working in the region to turn her dream into a reality for all girls in Pakistan. UNICEF condemned the assault, calling Yousufzai a ""courageous voice"" who speaks for millions of girls ""desperate to receive and education."" To make a donation to UNICEF's Stand with Malala campaign and support education programs in Pakistan, visit the organization's website. The Citizens Foundation has worked to improve education in Pakistan since 1995 and started 830 schools, according to the organization's website. The group says it encourages girls to enroll in its schools and works to ensure that approximately half of its students are female. Go online to make a donation. Developments in Literacy also operates schools and provides teacher training in Pakistan. The organization says that more than 17,000 students are enrolled in its schools, approximately 68% of them girls, according to its website. To make a donation in honor of Yousufzai, visit the group's website. Be sure to write ""Malala"" in the notes. ""I Am Malala"" is an online petition honoring Yousufzai and calling for Pakistan and countries worldwide to ensure all children have access to the education. The initiative was launched by the Office of the U.N. Special Envoy for Global Education. To sign the petition, visit the website.

"London (CNN) -- Britain has still not come to terms with the ""hurt and anger"" many felt as a result of Margaret Thatcher's policies more than two decades ago, a senior clergyman who will greet mourners at her funeral has said. In the week since Britain's first woman prime minister died, protests have been organized in London and elsewhere by activists who blame her for creating wide unemployment as she privatized industries and took on the unions. ""You have to ask the question -- why is it, 23 years after she left government, that Mrs. Thatcher is still such a controversial figure?"" the Very Rev. David Ison, the dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, said to CNN. ""And I think part of that is we still haven't come to terms with the hurt and the anger that many parts of society have felt because of the legacy of her government policies."" That hurt is being revived by the austerity policies brought in by the current government to try to tackle the deficit, he said. ""There is some real work to be done here about what's the relationship between the rich and the poor in our society, and how we can work together instead of being opposed to one another,"" he said. ""That's a particular agenda that I think that this funeral will be throwing up and highlighting."" Thatcher's funeral will be held at St. Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday morning, attended by more than 2,000 guests. They will include Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, as well as UK Prime Minister David Cameron and dozens more dignitaries from Britain and overseas. Thatcher herself approved the elements of the service, Ison said. ""It's a relatively simple and straightforward service; she was a Methodist by upbringing so no pomp and circumstance -- there's no tribute, there's no eulogy to her, there's very little in the service about her at all,"" he said. ""It's a simple service for praying for her and for the family around her."" The Bishop of London, the Right Rev. Richard Chartres, will give the address at the funeral, in which he will reflect on her death and her legacy, both as an individual and for wider society. Ison's role will be to welcome the queen and other guests at the cathedral doors and to bid the congregation farewell at the end of the service. Thatcher death 'party' Thatcher was prime minister from 1979 to 1990, having led the Conservative Party since 1974. Tributes to her achievements poured in from around the globe, as well as from many in Britain, after the news of her death on April 8 from a stroke, aged 87. A towering figure in postwar British and global politics, Thatcher is remembered in the world for her Cold War-era friendships with U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, as well as her role in shaping Britain's place in Europe and the short, sharp war she waged with Argentina over the disputed Falkland Islands. But a strong current of anti-Thatcher feeling has also been in evidence in Britain. At Trafalgar Square in central London on Saturday, activists and former miners held a ""party"" to celebrate her death, rallying around an effigy of Thatcher, whose orange hair was made out of plastic bags. The effigy was paraded around the square, which in 1990 was the scene of rioting against a hugely unpopular ""poll tax"" introduced by Thatcher. Protesters chanted ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, dead, dead, dead."" Workers also unfurled a ""National Union of Mineworkers"" banner, evoking memories of the painful yearlong coal miners' strike during the Thatcher years. In another indication of how divisive her legacy remains, a Facebook campaign to encourage people to buy the ""Wizard of Oz"" song ""Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead"" in celebration of Thatcher's death sent sales skyrocketing. The song reached No. 2 on the official national charts Sunday.

"(CNN) -- Ever since he was a young boy, Kenyan artist Cyrus Kabiru has envisaged breathing new life into his surroundings. ""When I woke up every morning, the first thing I'd see was trash,"" recalls Kabiru, whose childhood home faced a garbage heap where all of Nairobi's waste was dumped. ""I used to say to my dad that when I grow up, I want to give trash a second chance."" And that's exactly what he went on to do. A self-taught sculptor and painter, Kabiru is crafting visually striking artworks from abandoned refuse he collects from the streets of the Kenyan capital. The talented artist is best known for his ""C-Stunners,"" a series of eye-catching handmade spectacles. In Kabiru's hands, cast-aside bolts, wires, spoons and bottle tops gain a new lease of life as vital components of whimsical pieces of art. Stripped of their original value, the recycled materials are transformed into steampunk, one-of-a-kind creations that transcend traditional forms and challenge stereotypes. ""I don't see trash as waste,"" says Kabiru. ""I just see the trash as a chance for creativity."" Early struggles . The resourceful artist's fascination with glasses started at a very young age, inside the small two-bedroom house he shared with his parents and five siblings. He wanted to have a pair of his own spectacles, but his glasses-wearing father refused to give him his or get him any new ones. Back in the 1960s, Kabiru's father was beaten by his mother after accidentally destroying a pair of expensive glasses she'd bought him. That incident stayed with Kabiru's father, who told his young son that if he wanted to have eyewear, he should make it himself. Read this: 3D cartoon sees Kenya's politicians battle like 'Transformers' Kabiru took his father's words to heart. Soon after, he started crafting his own frames using cutlery, plastic and any other materials he could find in his house. Uninterested in studying, Kabiru would stay up at nights to sculpt and paint; at school, he'd use his creations to barter with his classmates. ""I never did exams, I never did homework,"" explains Kabiru. ""I used to exchange: 'you'll do my homework, I'll give you my artwork, you'll do my exam, I'll give you my artwork,' so that's how I survived in school."" After finishing high school, Kabiru's father wanted him to study electronic engineering, like most members of his family. Kabiru, however, had no desire to study. His rebellious attitude, coupled with his refusal to adhere to any norms, didn't go down well with his family or community. ""I grew up being a bad example,"" says Kabiru. ""Grownups used to tell their kids, 'you need to work hard or you'll be end up like Cyrus.'"" International recognition . Without any support from his family, Kabiru took his artwork and moved from his house to embark on his artistic journey. He rented a studio where, apart from his arresting spectacles, he started working on colorful and satirical paintings, as well as sculptures -- all made of recycled materials collected while roaming the streets of Nairobi. ""I love nature,"" says Kabiru. ""I walk every day, I can't survive without walking,"" he adds. ""I don't know how to sit idle."" Today, Kabiru's remarkable creations and commitment to the environment are increasingly earning him international recognition. He's been invited to speak at major events such as the TED2013 conference in California and Milan Fashion Week, while his work has been featured in many shows across the world. Read this: Boy's flashy invention scares off lions . Closer to home, Kabiru says things are changing as well -- his perseverance and hard work have now turned him into a ""good example"" for youth in his community. Earlier this year, Kabiru's father also visited his studio for the first time and was amazed by his son's work. ""[It made me] very proud,"" says Kabiru. ""They are now understanding me, so I'm very happy."" ""Selling poverty"" It's been an arduous journey for the soft-spoken artist, now in his 20s. ""It's hard to be an artist in Kenya,"" he admits. But Kabiru doesn't want to dwell on the struggles of the past or the problems he's currently facing. Too many Kenyan and African artists, he says, are interested in ""selling poverty instead of creativity."" ""You get people saying, 'I grew up in the Kibera slum, I grew up in this place and this place, buy my art,'"" says Kabiru. ""I want to change that -- not telling people about my problems, the poverty,"" he adds. ""I think it's good to sell the creativity you have done, telling people you have this place [so they can come] to buy your work and see your ideas."" Promoting art . When he's not crafting compelling artwork in his studio, or scouring the streets for materials, Kabiru is visiting rural communities in Kenya as part of his ""Outreach"" initiative, aimed at encouraging creativity and raising awareness about ecological issues in his country. In these areas, he holds workshops and teaches people how to create art with the materials surrounding them in an environmentally friendly way. He says he targets older generations because they are the ones who can have an impact in their communities. ""If I teach grandmothers something about deforestation or taking care of nature, it's easier for grandmothers to teach their children,"" he says. And even though Kabiru's art is winning more and more admirers of all ages both home and abroad, there's still one older person who needs convincing. ""My grandmother is, up to now, keep looking for a good job for me,"" says Kabiru. ""When you visit my grandmother, she asks you whether you work,"" he adds. ""If you say you're working, she'll ask you whether you can get an extra job for me.""","Cyrus Kabiru is a Kenyan self-taught sculptor and painter .

"(CNN) -- Nineteen elite firefighters died fighting the Yarnell Hill wildfire last month, and over the past few weeks, there has been an outpouring of support for their families. But what happens when the cards, letters and casserole dishes quit coming? That's where Vicki Minor and her team come in. Minor, a 2008 CNN Hero, created the Wildland Firefighter Foundation to provide emergency funds and long-term assistance to families who often have nowhere else to turn. Minor arrived in Prescott, Arizona, shortly after the tragedy and has already provided financial assistance to 12 of the 19 families. On Tuesday, for example, she mailed a check to a grieving mother in Colorado so that the mother could attend her son's funeral. This kind of rapid response is the foundation's specialty. ""When a firefighter dies in the line of duty ... their benefits aren't immediately available,"" said Burk Minor, Vicki's son. ""We know the bills keep coming."" The group's plan is to eventually connect with all of the families of the Granite Mountain Hotshots and offer them assistance, whether it's for immediate needs such as flights or hotels or for long-term needs such as housing or medical expenses. ""They're in a tremendous amount of pain,"" Vicki Minor said. ""It's hard enough to lose one. But when you lose 19 that are tight -- a brotherhood -- it's a domino effect."" The men who died were part of an elite team of wildland firefighters known as hotshots -- one of just 109 such crews in the United States. Wildland firefighters are a group, Vicki Minor says, that tends to be scattered throughout the country, and their work often takes them far from home. ""Our firefighters are nomadic,"" she said. ""Some of them are from New York, some of them are from Idaho. They're not usually in one town, and rarely do they ever die in the town they are (from)."" The fact that crews are so often spread out makes her services even more necessary, Minor says. Her group receives private donations, predominantly from other wildland firefighters. The assistance not only helps families get through hard times, it helps them feel that they are still a part of the wildland firefighter community. ""We do long-term recovery with them,"" she said. ""We keep them connected for as many years as they need to be with us."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes . She hopes to unite the families of the 19 with others who have also lost loved ones, so they can help provide emotional support. These are ""people who've really been there, (who) understand ... like no one else can,"" she said. ""They're going to help these families a lot. We've got women and family members who will be supporting these people after everything calms down."" For Vicki Minor, who got involved with the wildland firefighter community more than two decades ago, it's a labor of love. Since 1999, her nonprofit has helped thousands of firefighters and their families and raised more than $2 million to assist them. She plans to keep doing the work as long as she can. ""I will do anything to protect them and help them,"" she said. If you'd like to get involved and help the families of the fallen firefighters, visit the Wildland Firefighter Foundation or one of several firefighter charities listed on Impact Your World.","Vicki Minor's nonprofit provides support to the families of fallen wildland firefighters .

"(CNN) -- On January 6, 1367, at the Abbey of St. Andrew in Bordeaux, a royal baby was born. It was a boy. His father was the Prince of Wales, Edward of Woodstock (known to history as the Black Prince). His mother was a fabulously glamorous princess called Joan of Kent. The child's grandfather was the aging King Edward III, and although at the time of his birth little Richard of Bordeaux had a brother, the elder child would die, and Richard would grow up to be king of England himself, crowned as Richard II in 1377, when he was just 10 years old. His reign would be more or less a disaster, but we needn't delay ourselves too much with that right now. Richard of Bordeaux's birth was a moment of broad international interest. It mattered to the French, with whom the English were engaged in the Hundred Years War. It mattered in what we now call Spain, where the Black Prince was waging a brutal military campaign. It mattered to the other dignitaries of Europe. Richard's baptism was attended by three monarchs: Jaime IV, king of Mallorca; Richard, king of Armenia; and Pedro, the deposed king of Castile. In short, insofar as a medieval royal birth could be a world news event, this was. Cohen: How to raise a royal baby . Where I stood today at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, where Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Monday gave birth to a baby boy, there were no foreign kings and queens hanging about to take part in the pageantry. But the birth of the royal baby was a world news event all the same. There were rolling news crews from all over the world, beaming back to every inch of the globe pictures of ... well, of rolling news crews from all over the world. They knocked shoulders with tourists and well-wishers, who ranged from idle passersby to devoted monarchists wanting to drop off gifts for mother and baby. A few actual patients of the hospital leaned in doorways or rolled around in wheelchairs, looking bemused. It was a sweaty, heaving scrum. Why? How is it that when the power of the English royal family is a nano-fraction of what it once was, that the Windsors' celebrations and reproductions still captivate the world just as the births of Plantagenet and Tudor babies once did? 'Wicked' author: Royal baby stands for hope . The news crew with which I was filming today told me that they had also interviewed a sweet couple from Indiana, who said they thought that the British monarchy was marvelous. Given half a chance, said these beaming visitors and arbitrary bellwethers of American sentiment, they would gladly have a king and queen of the United States. Did someone say 1776? No? Thought not. I can't speak for the rest of the world, but in Britain it is fairly easy to analyze our own continuing fascination with, and popular enthusiasm for, the monarchy. Trite as it is to say, the royal family is a living link with our national history. Our history is built -- or taught, at any rate -- around reigns and dynasties. Our wonky constitution has largely evolved around the monarchy, from Magna Carta in 1215 to this year's Succession To The Crown Act, which provides (now, it seems, unnecessarily), for a girl to inherit royal power on equal standing in precedence to a younger brother. Opinion: Why I wouldn't want to be royal baby . Culturally, monarchy has also become a form of very upmarket reality TV show: a magazine-shifter and a newspaper-seller, whose present season has some really good characters, both old and young. There is human sympathy for the royals as ""real people"" who have been through ""tough times,"" but there is also the sneaking voyeurism attached to a family anointed, inescapably, with mystical celebrity. Who needs the Kardashians? We have the Royals, and they've been going for nearly a millennium. And then, of course, we secretly recognize that the royal family is virtually the only surviving relic of the rigid class system of the British past. Even if (most of us) don't miss it in practice, there is a shared snobbish pride among swathes of the conservative middle Britain in being able to present ourselves to the world as a land of ranks and titles, blue blood and high birth, a nation that still has a nonsensical strain of privilege at its heart. Opinion: Baby helps make a monarchy better . The very fact that this seems to fly in the face of every liberal credo of our times -- equality, democracy, meritocracy, openness, transparency, fairness -- only makes it more delicious. There is something medieval at the core of modern Britain, and I think we rather like the fact that the whole world is still prepared to sit up and celebrate it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan Jones.","Dan Jones: Royal births in past were world news events, as they were key to world politics .
He asks: Why, when Windsors have so little sway now, does a birth still captivate world?
He says Brits care: royal family a link to nation's history; Americans' interest less clear .
Jones: Monarchy like reality show; a tie to old class system. Brits jazzed that world cares ."
"(CNN) -- OK, I admit it: Annette Funicello was my first dream crush. Mind you, I didn't fall in love right away. Because, after all, when ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" premiered in 1955, I was barely out of diapers. (And as Woody Allen reminded us in ""Annie Hall,"" ""Even Freud speaks of a latency period!"") But when the five-day-a-week series went into syndicated reruns in the early '60s, I was a goner the first time I tuned in. Like millions of other guys my age at the time, I fell in love with that vivacious young beauty with the bright, beaming smile. And, as the show continued, the conspicuously blossoming, ahem, womanliness. Of course, there were other attractive ladies on the airwaves. There was Mary Tyler Moore flitting about in Capri pants throughout various episodes of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show."" And while some of us couldn't understand quite why Gomez (John Astin) was so attentive to Morticia (Carolyn Jones) on ""The Addams Family"" -- we couldn't help paying attention to her, too. But those and other prime-time persons of interest were women. (Like -- yikes! -- our moms.) Annette Funicello was different. She was our age, or close enough. And we couldn't get enough of her. Unfortunately, there never was enough. British novelist and critic L.P. Hartley was right: The past really is a foreign country -- and, man, we did things very differently there. In the early to mid-1960s, an era before cable, videocassettes, DVDs and the Internet, if you wanted to follow a star, well, you had just so many opportunities for star sightings. You missed ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" -- and Annette -- on Friday? Sorry, bud: You had to wait until Monday for another glimpse. And even later, when Annette branched out into movies -- you actually had to leave home and go to a movie theater to see her. And you did. If you are a guy of a certain age, you kinda grew up with Annette Funicello. You started paying attention to her on ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" at roughly the same time you started paying attention to girls your own age. And when she starred in ""Beach Party"" -- which begat ""Muscle Beach Party,"" then ""Bikini Beach"" and ""Pajama Party"" and ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" and on and on -- the time was just right for you to respond to a silly popcorn comedy filled with bubblegum pop tunes and bikini-clad cuties every bit as avidly as moviegoers of a later generation might respond to movies about hunky werewolves and sparkly vampires. Of course, if you were a guy of a certain age at a certain time -- hey, you had to hide your love away. If your buddies wanted to know why you needed to cut short a baseball game or wanted to change the channel from ""The Three Stooges"" to watch ""The Mickey Mouse Club,"" you couldn't very well tell them the truth. You had to say: ""Oh, I'm following that 'Hardy Boys' serial."" Or, ""Man, haven't you been keeping up with 'Spin & Marty' ?"" You never had to make a similar excuse to any girl you might be dating. And the beauty part was: Girls were never jealous of Annette. Why? Because most of them would admit that they wanted to be Annette. They had 45s of all her hit singles -- ""Pineapple Princess,"" ""Tall Paul,"" etc. -- and they really appreciated that you never complained when they played them over and over again. Annette Funicello represented an all-American ideal of perky, spunky, mid-'60s sexuality -- nonthreatening, effervescent, even wholesome. (She may be the only actress in the history of showbiz to look demurely G-rated even while wearing a bikini. Compared to her, even Sally Field in ""Gidget"" looked hot to trot.) And while I normally detest the cliche of referring to this or that fallen star as emblematic of ""a more innocent age,"" Annette serves as a reminder that, sometimes, ""cliche"" can be shorthand for ""undeniable truth."" Annette's career fell into decline, alas, as relatively innocent trifles such as ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" were edged out of theaters by the likes of ""The Graduate"" and ""Easy Rider,"" as the much-sought ""youth audience"" started demanding less homogenized and more realistic depictions of teen and twenty-something life in feature films. And as kid-skewing shows such as ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" were supplanted in late-afternoon TV schedules by syndicated chat-shows featuring Mike Douglas and Merv Griffin. To her credit, Annette Funicello retained her dignity and remained relatively active long after her heyday passed. In fact, her post-'60s career path might serve as a game plan for contemporary teen phenoms, including a few who got their first break on Disney Channel series. And even as her visibility was limited to a TV guest spot here or a nostalgia-drenched spoof there (she and Frankie Avalon reteamed in 1987 for ""Back to the Beach,"" a box-office underachiever), her fans continued to hold a soft place in their hearts for her. We were saddened and sympathetic when we learned of her battle with multiple sclerosis. And Monday, as reports of her passing circulate, we mourn her passing. And yes: Quite a few of us bid a fond farewell to a first sweetheart. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joseph Leydon .","Joe Leydon: Annette Funicello, who died Monday, was the first crush of millions of boys .

"(Real Simple) -- Why did women start carrying handbags? Here, the answer to this and other puzzlers. How Did the Trend for Pointed-Toe Shoes Start? Long before they ever made an appearance on ""Sex and the City,"" pointed shoes were favored by Polish nobles, who introduced the fashion to England on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s. The shoes, dubbed ""crackowes"" or ""poulaines"" -- after KrakÃ³w, Poland -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging. In 1363 the English attempted to rein in the look by law, assigning shoe spans to social classes. Commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches, while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length. Real Simple: Anti-aging style secrets . Who Invented the Sports Bra? In 1977 University of Vermont student Lisa Lindahl was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra wasn't holding up. With the help of two classmates, Lindahl sewed together two jock straps and -- presto! -- the sports bra was born. The coeds founded the company Jogbra a year later, garnering eternal gratitude from exercise-loving women everywhere. Real Simple: Restyle Your Style . Is There a Real Mary Jane Behind Mary Jane Shoes? Not quite: The most widely held theory is that the single-strapped footwear was named for a character in ""Buster Brown,"" a children's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s. Mary Jane was either Buster Brown's sweetheart or sister, depending on which source you consult. Real Simple: 10 Style Upgrades Under $50 . What's the Connection Between Shakespeare and Raincoats? Gabardine, a water-repellent fabric invented by Burberry, got its first mention from Shakespeare. The Bard used the word in The Merchant of Venice to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms. During World War I, British officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original Burberry trench. Real Simple: Pretty smart . Who Was the First Person Known to Have Pierced Ears? No one knows who originated the style, but there's evidence that as early as 2500 B.C. Sumerian women wore pierced earrings -- gold half-moon hoops. Men have been wearing earrings since ancient Egypt, where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 B.C. What Was the Inspiration for Lilly Pulitzer's Colorful Printed Dresses? Bored Palm Beach socialite Lilly Pulitzer opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time, but she found one drawback: The citrus concoctions discolored her clothes. She instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains, and the ""Lilly"" design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born. The style was an instant hit with customers, who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice. Real Simple: Dress to flatter your figure . How did Pumps, Stilettos, and Sneakers Get Their Names? The term pump first popped up in 1550 in England, where male servants sported the style. It is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose-fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump. The word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore ""sneaky."" The modern usage of stiletto, a Renaissance-era Italian word for an assassin's narrow-bladed knife, made its debut in 1953. The word turned out to be especially appropriate, because the shoes' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors. Real Simple: Avoiding Wardrobe Blunders . When Did Folks Start Toting Around Umbrellas? For thousands of years, in such places as Egypt, China, Japan, Mesopotamia, and India, umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun. (When it rained, the well-to-do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs.) Umbrellas weren't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. And another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight, portable, and available to average Joes. Have Bikinis Always Been So Popular? Hardly! Named for the nuclear-testing site Bikini Atoll, the suits first appeared in 1946, but American women thought them immodest. Not until the 1960s were they accepted, possibly helped by the hit song ""Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini."" Real Simple: Old Clothing Gets a Second Life . Were French Cuffs Really Created for the Battlefield? It is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat. But, in fact, French royalty invented the style in the 1500s, when flowing sleeves were the rage; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners. Amusingly, the competitive English tried to take credit for the fashion, which to this day they refer to as ""double cuffs."" Have Women Always Carried Purses? Once upon a time, ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing (sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack) and accessible through slits in their skirts. Around 1800, thinner, silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue, and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections. The solution? They began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead. Real Simple: New Uses for Things in Your Closet . Why Is Underwear Nicknamed ""Drawers""? In the 16th century, drawers became a common term for both men's and women's underpants. Made of linen, the items were no-frills and looked more or less interchangeable (this being well before Victoria ever had a secret; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century). Most likely, underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body.

"Boston (CNN) -- With defendant James ""Whitey"" Bulger sitting less than 8 feet away and staring straight ahead, a star government witness in the case against Bulger explained Monday why he turned against the man he long counted among ""my partners in crime, my best friends."" Aging mobster John Martorano said he learned Bulger was an FBI informant, the worst thing you could be in ""Southie,"" a part of Boston that prided itself on absolute loyalty. ""It broke my heart. It broke all loyalties,"" said Martorano, his testimony laced with what sounded like sadness. Late Monday night, Bulger's defense filed a motion requesting that the court inform the jury that Martorano is a cooperating government witness and is testifying in exchange for a lesser sentence on murder charges. Martorano pleaded guilty to 10 murders in 1999 and later admitted to 20, so defense attorney J.W. Carney said the jury should be told to consider Martorano's testimony with caution. Prosecutor Fred Wyshak responded Tuesday that the defense was ""playing games"" and said issuing a cautionary instruction mid-testimony would ""send a very bad message to the jury."" Former bookie takes Bulger trial down memory lane . Judge Denise Casper did not rule on the motion but said she would consider issuing instructions regarding nonspecific witnesses when the jury is read the final charges. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during the nearly two decades that federal prosecutors say he was the head of the Irish mob in Boston. For three decades, Martorano said, he was tight with Bulger and Bulger's partner, Steven Flemmi. ""They were my partners in crime, my best friends, my children's godfathers,"" said the 72-year-old divorced mobster who now lives on Social Security and who sold his life story in hopes of getting it made into a movie. The men were so close, Martorano even named his youngest son ""James Steven"" after his two friends. In a flat, emotionless voice, former hitman Martorano began to describe some of the murders he said he committed, several of them, he testified, with Bulger along. Martorano said he was the trigger man while Bulger was backup to ensure the ""hit"" was successful. In one case, Bulger used his car to block a target coming out a side street. Martorano, who said he was firing out the back window from another car during the incident, testified that Bulger ""was afraid he was going to get shot because tracer bullets were coming out of the machine gun and flying over his head."" ""Was he angry?"" asked Wyshak, the prosecutor. ""No. He was joking about it,"" replied Martorano. A 'hands-on killer?' Martorano also described the killings of two brothers after one of them had angered Bulger's gang. One brother was tracked down at a restaurant in Medford, Massachusetts, and ""I shot him in the heart,"" Martorano said. When the other brother was killed later, Bulger and his gang stashed the body in the trunk of a car then drove the car south and dropped it at a housing project in South Carolina where, as he had expected, ""a few kids stole the car,"" Martorano said. Under a plea deal, Martorano was sentenced to 14 years in prison in exchange for fully testifying against Bulger. He served 12 years and was released in 2007. His testimony also was crucial against corrupt FBI agent John Connolly, who was found guilty in federal court on racketeering and obstruction-of-justice charges, among others. Connolly served 10 years in federal prison and is now doing an additional 40 years in state prison after being found guilty for his role in the murder of Florida businessman and former World Jai Alai owner John Callahan. Flemmi, Bulger's partner, is serving life terms without parole but avoided a possible death sentence by cooperating with federal authorities. The connection between Bulger and Connolly also was the focus of Martorano's testimony Monday. Martorano said Bulger grew up in the same Boston housing project as Connolly, who looked up to both Bulger and his brother William, who rose to serve as state Senate president in Massachusetts. According to Martorano's testimony, when Connolly returned to Boston as an FBI agent, he thanked ""Billy"" Bulger for ""keeping me honest"" and told him ""If there's anything I can do ..."" Billy Bulger said, ""If you could keep my brother out of trouble, that would be a great help,"" according to Martorano. Martorano testified that he, Whitey Bulger and the others agreed that Whitey would meet with Connolly and ""be a good listener."" It wasn't long before Whitey Bulger was giving Connolly money and buying gifts including unset diamonds for Connolly to give to his fiancee as an engagement present, Martorano said. Prosecutors and law enforcement officials say it was the corrupt relationship between Whitey Bulger and Connolly that allowed Bulger's criminal enterprise to grow and even facilitated some murders. The trial, which enters its fifth day Tuesday, is expected to take up to three months and has the potential to reveal sensational details about the mob and FBI corruption, especially if Bulger chooses to testify. Bulger was in hiding for 16 years before he was captured in Santa Monica, California, two years ago, living under a false name with his girlfriend in an apartment. At his July 2011 arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to the 19 murder charges and 13 other counts.","NEW: Defense wants jury to be told witness testified for lesser murder sentence .

"(CNN) -- A minute before three o'clock on Saturday, Peter Rebak will be scouring the stands of the Harry Abrahams Stadium looking for dissent. Not that his football club is used to crowd trouble. Wingate & Finchley play in the Rymans Premier League, the seventh tier of English football. Second from bottom in the division the club's fans are in the hundreds, rather than thousands. But on Saturday, Wingate & Finchley will do something unique: They are the only football club in England to announce that they will hold a minute's silence for former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher -- MP for Finchley between 1959 and 1992 -- who died of a stroke at the age of 87. ""I don't care if people support her or not but I do expect everyone there to behave themselves,"" the 60-year-old Rebak, who is the club's former chairman, told CNN. This is irrelevant to politics."" ""If anyone wants to misbehave I'll personally go down and throw them out."" International grief . When Thatcher's death was announced earlier this week, tributes poured in from around the world. Obama, Gorbachev, Netanyahu; political heavyweights one and all. But closer to home the eulogies were more abrasive. Those on the right revered her as the woman that confronted the unions and ""saved"" the country, as current Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron put it in a recent speech. Those on the left lambasted her for laying waste to the industrial north, responsible for massive unemployment in football's heartlands: Manchester, Newcastle and Liverpool among others. Two English Premier League chairman -- Dave Whelan of Wigan and John Madjeski of Reading, both of whom were also Conservative party donors -- suggested that a minute's silence would be appropriate before this weekend's matches. ""We owe Mrs. Thatcher a minute's silence,"" Whelan had told the BBC ahead of his side's FA Cup semifinal against Millwall on Saturday. ""It is not my decision, it is for the FA to decide, but I would be in favor of wearing an armband out of respect to Mrs. Thatcher."" But the response from the fans was furious and the English Football Association decided against it. ""A minute silence is to mark and remember football people. Great football people. Or moments of national tragedy where all unite, say 9/11 or Remembrance Sunday,"" explained David Conn a football writer for The Guardian newspaper. ""It was above politics. They have never had a minute's silence for a political figure. By definition it is divisive."" Another battleground . Football, Conn explained, had never been looked on kindly by Thatcher. ""She presided over the worst decade for [English] football in its history,"" he said. ""There were problems with supporters fighting. All that was done was to vilify and control supporters. ""She hated football. She regarded football fans as the 'enemies within'. She wanted to batter football intro submission. She saw it as another area of insurrection."" The ""enemies within"" was also a phrase Thatcher used to describe the unions, the battle which perhaps more than any other defined her time in office. To try and curb hooligan violence at football matches, fences were erected around each pitch. An ID card scheme for every fan, with draconian jail sentences for anyone found without one, was piloted at Luton Town. But the violence continued. When the Heysel disaster took place at the 1985 European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus, leaving 39 fans -- 32 of them Italian -- dead, Thatcher insisted that English teams be withdrawn from European competition. The ban remained for five years . Hillsborough . But football's nadir came four years later at Hillsborough. Ninety six Liverpool fans were killed in a stadium crush during an FA Cup semifinal in 1989. The government and the police blamed Liverpool fans for deaths, while British tabloid newspaper The Sun ran lurid stories of the supporter's complicity in the tragedy, all of which were late to be found to false. ""Liverpool was one of the few British cities that actually stood up to Thatcher and her policies. The city's trade unionists and politicians were a constant source of irritation to her,"" said Tony Barrett, the Merseyside football writer for The Times newspaper. ""She didn't get us and we most certainly didn't get her. The problem with that relationship is that she wielded the power and she allowed Liverpool to crumble. ""As a child growing up in 1980s the signs of mass unemployment, urban decay and grinding poverty were everywhere. She couldn't have cared less."" Twenty years later Liverpool's fans were exonerated of any wrongdoing with the release of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report. Low safety standards and poor policing were blamed. The report also exposed two decades of cover ups. David Cameroon stood in the House of Commons and apologized. The city never forgot the person who they saw as being ultimately in charge at the time. ""On Hillsborough, it is difficult to identify or establish exactly what role Thatcher played, if any, in the cover up that followed the disaster,"" added Barrett. ""There is evidence that came to light following the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel report last September, which proves that Thatcher was not happy with the interim report from Lord Justice Taylor. ""The report laid the blame where it belonged - at the door of South Yorkshire Police - and she made it clear that she was not happy about that. ""The suspicion of the Hillsborough families and their supporters is that Thatcher's involvement went beyond this."" Thatcher's legacy? Rebak sees Thatcher's influence on the game in a different way. He argues that Thatcher saved football from itself. ""When you look at the 80s English football was terrorized by hooligans and derelict stadia,"" he says. ""She said, this could not continue. The hooligan element was destroying English football."" Shortly after Hillsborough the Taylor Report's review of the tragedy changed the game forever. Stadiums became all seater and safety was improved. The influx of money from Sky Television -- owned by Rupert Murdoch -- then revolutionized the game, playing a big part in turning English football in to the global entertainment product it is today, for good or ill. Yet Rebak claims the club decided to have a minute's silence, not out of politics, but because Thatcher was a patron the club and, in one of her last acts as MP for Finchley, helped save it from going out of business. Humble roots . Wingate FC was founded in 1946 by British Jewish soldiers returning from the Second World War. ""The aim was to fight racism. Initially it was anti-Semitism and that changed through time to anti-discrimination,"" explained Rebak. The club's name derived from an eccentric British army officer called Orde Wingate, a pioneer in modern guerrilla warfare that trained what would become the Israeli Defense Force. ""They [the returning soldiers] believed the only way to increase friendship was sport, between faiths and races. To play against each other and with each other,"" added Rebak. The club eventually bought their Hall Round ground. The England 1966 World Cup squad even trained there once before the tournament. When the ground was knocked down to make way for a new motorway, the club was homeless, though it had money in the bank. By 1991 it was mooted that the club merge with nearby Finchley, which had a dilapidated stadium but no money. ""It wasn't important, it was essential,"" said Rebak of the merger, who was chairman at the time of Thatcher's intervention. ""She accepted the two clubs should merge in 1991. And she played a major role in bringing the two clubs together and assisting us. She would tell us who to contact, speak to them, helped with the new lease. ""She thought it was good idea. She came to the ground once. It was only 100 yards from her Finchley office."" Wingate & Finchley are in a tiny minority. Only two other sports teams have declared they will allow a minute's silence before the game: top division rugby union clubs Exeter Chiefs and Saracens, which is also found in Thatcher's old Finchley constituency. ""We have a sold out match and we are fairly confident that the overwhelming majority of Saracens supporters will approve,"" said Saracen's chief executive Edward Griffiths. ""If on Saturday someone interrupts a minute's silence, then that is democracy. We live in a free country, something Thatcher worked for as much as anyone to protect."" Another minute's silence . Just over an hour's drive west of Finchley, at exactly the same time on Saturday afternoon, a very different minute's silence will begin before Reading's match against Liverpool: to mark the 24th anniversary of Hillsborough. Initially Madjeski -- the Reading chairman -- had suggested a minute's silence for Thatcher too. ""If they do hold a minute's silence for Margaret Thatcher, I think they are making a big mistake,"" said Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, who lost her 18 year old son in the tragedy. ""Somebody fed [Thatcher] those lies, I think she was part of it and she knew about it. That's why I feel the way I do."" But Madjeski backed down, realizing that silence was unlikely. ""[Hillsborough is] the only minute's silence there should be this weekend,"" agreed Liverpool coach Brenden Rogers. Divine intervention . Rebak isn't sure how many will be at the Harry Abrahams Stadium on Saturday when Wingate & Finchley takes on Kingstonian F.C. in their vital relegation clash. ""Maybe 500 or 600 and some away fans too,"" he estimates. He'll be keeping an eye out, hoping that the match will pass without intervention. Or, at the least, not the intervention he fears. ""We need a good three points,"" said Rebak. ""Maybe we can get some divine intervention from Mrs T.""","Debate over whether a minute's silence should be held for Margaret Thatcher before this weekend's sporting fixtures .

Only tiny Wingate & Finchley from Thatcher's own constituency has said it will hold a minute's silence ."
"London (CNN) -- Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who died Monday at the age of 87, helped to shape the course of 20th century history -- but not everyone believes the Iron Lady changed things for the better. People around the globe took to Twitter following the announcement of Thatcher's death to offer tributes, and debate her legacy for Britain and for the world. .","Britain's former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher died in London Monday at the age of 87.
Thatcher's admirers and detractors were quick to share their reactions to the news on Twitter."
"London (CNN) -- Margaret Thatcher was a giant in late 20th century British politics, in large part due to her revolutionary approach to the economy. It is no accident that her economic strategy and policies became known as ""Thatcherism."" Her policies revolutionized the domestic economy and also had huge influence abroad -- not least of all in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, freed from Soviet control in the early 1990s. To get an idea of the enormity of her influence it is vital to understand the parlous state Britain was in the 1960s and 1970s. OBITUARY: Britain's ""Iron Lady"" dies at 87 . It was a country that, in the words of former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson, had ""lost an empire and has not yet found a role"" and it was a country that was persistently underperforming its European neighbors. Indeed it was the feeling that the six of the European Economic Communities (EEC) were leaving Britain behind economically that was one of the main reasons for its membership in 1973. But, EEC membership did not solve Britain's problems. Britain's problems, including the appalling industrial relations, were only tackled when Thatcher became prime minister in 1979. When I was a young civil servant in the 1970s in the Treasury, I was told that government in Britain was all about ""managing decline."" Defeatism was endemic. Share your memories, tributes and thoughts on Thatcher's death on iReport . Both the major parties (Labour and Conservative) had adopted a quasi-consensus, Keynesian interventionist approach to the economy post WWII, in which large parts of the productive economy, including the utilities, were state monopolies. Competition was a foreign, if not a dirty, word. And high taxes blunted entrepreneurial spirits and business activity. Under these circumstances it should have been of no surprise to anyone, that Britain's future was indeed was all about managing decline. The image of an aristocratic family down on its luck, wearing threadbare jackets and scuffed shoes, comes to mind. Enterprise, profit, low taxes and risk-taking were concepts that were foreign (and especially American) in Britain. It is absolutely no exaggeration to say that Thatcher changed the whole approach to the economy and business. ""Managing decline"" was not for her. She was determined to implement the policies, however uncomfortable and unpalatable they were at the time, to inject energy, enterprise and competition into business and into the economy. Tinkering interventionism was out and union reform (long overdue), privatization, competition, sound public finances and low taxes were in. All in all, her polices amounted to a ""supply side"" revolution. And it was a revolution. Businesses and entrepreneurs were now to be seen as the drivers of economic growth and not interfering governments. The default mechanism of post-war British economic policy was reset. It was a staggering success. After a rocky start -- there was a nasty recession in the early 1980s from which parts of manufacturing did not recover -- the British economy began to perform significantly better. Allied with canny policies to free up the City of London and attract inward investment, Britain became the number one destination for overseas investment. The sense of defeatism was consigned, at least at the time, to history. In the late 1980s and early 1990s I well remember my Japanese colleagues' admiration for her and all that she had done for Britain's standing in the international business world, and their sheer bemusement when she was forced out of office. Thatcher was a politician of enormous skill, determination, courage and, above all else, conviction. And she was ably assisted by, amongst others, Lord (Geoffrey) Howe, Lord (Nigel) Lawson, Lord (David) Young and Lord (Norman) Tebbit. They helped her push through her vision against the most appalling opposition from the unions to the economics profession and the CBI. Sadly, much of her excellent work was destroyed under the Tony Blair government when chancellor Gordon Brown's profligacy wrecked the public finances and his ill-advised changes to banking supervision severely damaged the financial system. Speaking as one who saw the Thatcherite revolution ""in action,"" I find it immensely saddening. We need a new Margaret Thatcher, one with the vision to correct the country's horrendous problems, as she did in the 1980s. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruth Lea .","Thatcher was a giant in British politics, in large part due to her revolutionary approach to the economy .

"(CNN) -- On Thursday night, I returned to Caracas, Venezuela, to participate in the funeral and mourning of Hugo Chavez, president of Venezuela from 1999 until his passing this week. Chavez's death has captured the world's attention front and center with renewed vigor and interest. He first burst onto the world scene with his presidential victory in 1999. Since then, through his fourth re-election in January -- and while he was in Cuba fighting the cancer that would take his life -- his focus was on forging a new socialist Venezuela. This won many friends and advocates at home and abroad, especially among Venezuela's and the hemisphere's poorest populations. Other world powers demonized Chavez and sought to ostracize him, a la Cuba's Fidel Castro, on a global scale. But I believe peaceful, constructive negotiation should carry the day over isolation and demonization. That's why I visited Venezuela in 2005, just after the Rev. Pat Robertson called for the assassination of Chavez. He inflamed a chorus of extremist voices in seeking a way to ""deal with Chavez."" That type of hot rhetoric serves no productive purpose. I went to talk with Chavez; I talked with Jewish religious leaders in Venezuela. I talked with Afro-Venezuelans. I learned about the transition taking place from the old banana republic regimes to the new leaders, with new ideas, such as Chavez in Venezuela, Luiz Lula da Silva in Brazil and Juan Manuel Santos in Colombia. I looked not to exploit differences and fuel division, but for common ground. That's why I went to Iraq to talk with Saddam Hussein in 1990 as he invaded Kuwait and convinced him there was no value in holding hundreds of people from the United States and other countries as ""human shields."" He released them. That's why I went to what remained of Yugoslavia amid the flames of war in 1999, to talk with Slobodan Milosevic to persuade him to release the three U.S. soldiers being held hostage. He did. And that's why I went to Cuba in 1984 -- long under a senseless U.S. blockade -- to talk with Castro and persuade him to release dozens of political prisoners. In each instance, the U.S. had a no-talk policy with these leaders and nations. It's been my experience that talking, keeping lines of communication open to friend and foe alike, can reap dividends. Nations cannot always agree, but we can always talk. That does not require a sacrifice of principles or signal weakness. I believe in the Gandhi principles, favoring peaceful negotiation over military confrontation. He called the doctrine ""satyagraha"" -- and explained the ""pursuit of truth did not admit of violence being inflicted on one's opponent but that he must be weaned from error by patience and compassion. ""For what appears to be truth to the one may appear to be error to the other. And patience means self-suffering. So the doctrine came to mean vindication of truth, not by infliction of suffering on the opponent, but on oneself."" It works. In my view, it's always more productive and mutually beneficial to talk things out and not fight things out. As the world mourns the death of Chavez, it's time to go beyond divisive rhetoric and historical fears that leave all of us in the dark. Where is our common ground? We are neighbors; we live in the same hemisphere. There are 200,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. -- including nearly 70 Major League baseball players in 2012, among them Triple Crown winner Miguel Cabrera. We are trading partners. Venezuela surpassed Saudi Arabia as the nation with the largest oil reserves in the world, and the U.S. is the largest importer of Venezuelan oil. That oil is four days away, compared with four weeks away in the Middle East. There is a huge potential to expand our market and Venezuela's. And with stronger economic ties comes political stabilization. It's time to turn crisis into opportunity, to fulfill the unfinished business of realizing to the fullest potential the relationship between the U.S. and Venezuela. Seize this moment to heal the wound and bind the ties. It won't be easy, but nothing is. And nothing will be accomplished with a no-talk policy. No doubt, Venezuela's relations with the U.S. have been strained -- diplomatic relations were severed for a time in 2008 when Venezuela accused the U.S. of plotting the overthrow of Chavez. Just last week, days before Chavez died, Vice President Nicolas Maduro expelled two U.S. military officials, accusing the U.S. of trying to destabilize the government. The good news is that President Barack Obama has sought to restore relations, saying in a statement that the United States ""reaffirms its support for the Venezuelan people and its interest in developing a constructive relationship with Venezuela's government. ... As Venezuela begins a new chapter in its history, the United States remains committed to policies that promote democratic principles, the rule of law and respect for human rights."" The U.S. is sending an official delegation to Chavez's funeral. And Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have expressed their desire to forge a more positive and productive relationship with Venezuela. As I meet with political, religious and community leaders in Venezuela, this is the message I bring. Let's put an end to hot rhetoric, demonization and policies of isolation. It's time to forge a practical, productive relationship that will lead to normalization of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Venezuela.","Jesse Jackson: Chavez's death an opportunity for U.S. and Venezuela to heal relations .

"(CNN) -- Embattled country singer Mindy McCready fought for custody of her son in an Arkansas courtroom Friday, a little more than a week after she was accused of fleeing with the 5-year-old and refusing to return the boy for days. The judge in the case made no decision in the custody hearing, which pitted McCready against her mother. The hearing was continued to a later date, said Kat Atwood, McCready's publicist. ""Mindy and her family are pleased the courts are handling this case with care,"" Atwood said. The judge could decide whether the boy stays in foster care under Arkansas state custody, goes to his grandmother's home in Florida or goes to McCready's home, CNN affiliate KARK reported. This custody battle became national news after McCready took her son from her mother's Florida home in late November and had asked a court to restore custody to her out of concern over the boy's safety. On December 1, a Florida judge issued an emergency ""pick up"" order for young Zander McCready. Days after the order, McCready was found by authorities hiding in a closet with her son in a home in Arkansas. The boy was then taken into the custody of the Arkansas Division of Children and Family Services. Until recently, the boy had been living with Mindy McCready's mother and stepfather, Gayle and Michael Inge, who have legal custody. The singer, who has fought a public battle against drug addiction, has visitation rights. The singer burst on the music scene in 1996 with the debut album ""10,000 Angels"" and the chart-topping country hit ""Guys Do It All the Time."" McCready participated in the 2009 season of the reality TV show ""Celebrity Rehab With Dr. Drew."" A biography on her website says she had an ""explosive relationship"" with the boy's father, Billy McKnight, who also is a country singer. McKnight released a statement about the incident just after the boy was found in Arkansas. ""As we move forward from this incident, please remember that everyone has the ability to make positive changes in their life,"" the statement said.","A judge could decide if McCready's son lives with the singer or the boy's grandmother .

"(CNN) -- Roger Ebert's death, coming so soon after he announced he was curtailing his movie-reviewing schedule because of recurring cancer, is being greetedâ€”especially across the Internet--with widespread shock, and the kind of grief one feels when one loses a longtime neighbor, a trusted friend, a beloved teacher whose lessons may not have had an immediate impact but became more meaningful with time. Who could have imagined the American people would ever feel that way about a critic, any critic? Few could have as far back as 1975 when Ebert, the prize-winning film reviewer for the Chicago Sun-Times, first teamed up with his Chicago Tribune competitor Gene Siskel for a locally broadcast weekly series, ""Coming to a Theater Near You."" Over the next 24 years, their weekly half-hour of movie clips and clipped arguments became an ever-expanding nationwide franchise. It catapulted both men to fame and riches befitting media icons -- and altered preconceived notions of what a critic looked and sounded like. Opinion: Ebert's sheer love of life . In fact, it's only natural the blogosphere should feel the pain of Ebert's leaving. One could say that blogs of all shapes, sizes and subjects owe their existence in part to the examples set by Siskel and Ebert. Long before Siskel and Ebert helped embed the ""thumbs up/thumbs down"" judgment meme in television folklore, critics were viewed in the popular imagination as fastidious bullies, often packing European accents and high-end vocabularies, with nothing but bad will to deliver to anything they saw or heard. The type was best embodied in past epochs by the performances of George Sanders or Clifton Webb, who portrayed acid-tongued theater critics in, respectively, ""All About Eve"" (1950) and ""Laura"" (1944). Siskel and Ebert knew about those movies, but they knew many more things those mythical assailants of reputation could not. The broad perspective they brought to movies also widened the public's view of critics. They were bright Midwestern guys who were, yes, erudite enough to know their European classics as well as the comparative merits of animated Disney musicals. They also were capable of squirting venom on things they didn't like with conspicuous panache. But their warm manner, open-ended aesthetics and companionable personalities helped viewers understand that criticism wasn't always about being, well, critical. It was a way of seeing the world, of thinking your way through something you otherwise took for granted. Their approach made criticism not only less threatening and formidable, but it also made critical thinking seem accessible, even, well, friendly. HLN: Favorite Roger Ebert quotes . Siskel accurately rated Ebert the better prose stylist of the pair. Certainly, he was the more celebrated writer, having been the first movie reviewer to win a Pulitzer Prize for criticism, in 1975. As idiosyncratic as his style could be (rakish and puckish when he felt mischievous; oracular and didactic when he felt messianic), he was never conspicuously out for blood the way Simon Cowell, the serpentine, post-millennial, popular prototype of a critic, often seemed to be when assessing talent on TV. His annual movie yearbooks exhibited his witty, humane approach to reviewing and to celebrity interviews, which somehow retained his personal touch even in later years as publicists tightened their control over one-on-one access to actors and directors. He was never shy about showing off his knowledge of movie history, but he also never made it seem like a closed shop, open only to a favored few. He wanted more readers to like better movies. And he carried out his mission through a website that became as much a trendsetter for other Internet venues as the Siskel-and-Ebert model became for point-counterpoint TV panel shows. One sensed Ebert's enjoyment at being a role model for movie geeks who wanted to get their own aesthetic values aired on the Web. As with his late partner, Ebert worked at putting on no airs. He seemed less like a snooty aesthete than a regular guy who just happened to know a little more about movies than anyone else in the neighborhood and set up a little corner stand to talk about them. If, as is often remarked, everybody's a critic, then Roger Ebert was one of the crucial forces responsible for empowering everybody to believe they're critics. Remembering Roger Ebert . This may annoy those who remain averse to the idea of criticism itself. But Ebert, who also used his blog for occasional political or social commentary, would probably reply by saying that, if anything, there aren't enough people engaging in critical thinking when it comes to matters affecting their own lives. And by ""critical,"" I doubt very much that Ebert would have meant a position of carping or complaining or even cutting-down-to-size so much as a state of heightened perception, of being open enough to the possibility that whatever you're looking at or listening to may not be what it seems -- or should be. As the lights went down one last time, Ebert would have loved it if all those people sitting in the dark and hoping for the best understood that his approach to movies was big enough, openhearted enough to embrace far more than the movies he'd loved all his life. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: News of film critic Roger Ebert's death lamented across Internet .

"(CNN) -- A Florida judge has signed an emergency ""pickup order"" authorizing law enforcement officers to get the 5-year-old son of country singer Mindy McCready, a court spokeswoman said Thursday. Earlier this week, McCready was told in a different court order to return the child -- of whom she does not have legal custody -- to authorities. The child was not brought in, prompting Judge James H. Seals to sign the emergency order around 4 p.m. Thursday , said Sheila Mann, a spokeswoman for Florida's 20th Judicial Circuit court. ""The child is now an official missing person,"" said Aimee McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Children's Network of Southwest Florida, the lead agency for child welfare services . McCready has not been charged with any crime. The latest order means that law enforcement officers now have the right to take custody of her son, Zander, who she has said is with her, even if he is not in Florida, McLaughlin explained. The 36-year-old singer never contacted the Children's Network after the initial court order, according to McLaughlin. And 20th Judicial Court official Penelope Rose also said late Thursday afternoon that the singer hadn't delivered the child to court authorities. The boy's father, Billy McKnight, said that he talked with Zander by phone on Thursday night and said the boy ""sounded OK."" But McKnight said he wasn't sure when he'd see the boy again. ""I don't know if (McCready) plans on bringing him back,"" McKnight, himself a country singer, told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell. ""She didn't lead me to believe that she was going to."" McCready's parents have legal custody of the child, while the entertainer has visitation rights, said Terri Durdaller, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Children and Families. A caseworker reported no problems during a visit last week, but that was not the case Tuesday, McLaughlin said. That day, a caseworker who went to the home of McCready's father could not find McCready or the child, Durdaller said. The worker became ""concerned about the well-being"" of the boy and contacted law enforcement, according to a report obtained from the Cape Coral Police Department. On Wednesday, McCready told HLN that her son is fine. Cape Coral police spokesman Lt. Tony Sizemore told CNN the issue was a ""civil matter"" and there was no missing child alert. Meanwhile, McCready's publicist issued a statement saying McCready ""has not been charged with illegal wrongdoing."" ""Ms. McCready's number one priority has always been, and continues to be, the safety of her son,"" publicist Kat Atwood said in the statement. ""The 5-year-old boy has been with his mother for more than 30 days; law enforcement officials spoke with the child and saw Zander via Skype yesterday."" McCready has asked a court to have her son returned to her out of concern over his safety, Atwood said. With the emergency pickup order now official, local law enforcement will update the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the FBI's National Crime Information Center about the case, according to McLaughlin. ""Once the child is located, we will make plans to bring the child back to the home of his maternal grandmother, which is the legally approved place,"" she said. McLaughlin said that Zander's safety was state authorities' top concern. ""In any case, not just this one, we want to ensure the well-being of the child,"" the spokeswoman said. McCready burst on the music scene in 1996, with the debut album ""10,000 Angels"" and the chart-topping country hit, ""Guys Do It All the Time."" In addition to romances with musician David Malloy and actor Dean Cain -- as well as admitting to an affair with baseball player Roger Clemens, which he didn't confirm or deny -- her official biography also touches on her career stalling as well as her ""explosive relationship"" with McKnight. She has waged a public battle with drug addiction over the past several years, including being a participant in the 2009 season of the reality TV show ""Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew."" She was rushed to a Fort Myers, Florida, hospital last year, Cape Coral Hospital spokeswoman Karen Krieger said, after a 911 caller claimed the singer had overdosed. McCready is currently pregnant with twins, according to her publicist. Her official biography notes her 2010 ""triumphant return to her first love, music ... after an eight-year recording hiatus"" with the album, ""I'm Still Here."" McKnight, the father of her child, refused to speculate Thursday night on McCready's current mental state or sobriety. He told HLN that he wants her to ""get herself healthy,"" so the two can work together ""as two adults ... to make (their son's) life better."" ""My biggest concern is the fact that Zander is used to being here in Florida,"" said McKnight, referring to the state that he and the boy call home. ""I'm worried about him just being moved around.""","NEW: The boy's father doesn't think McCready will bring the child to Florida .

"(CNN) -- Less than six weeks after President Hugo Chavez's death, Venezuelans will head to the polls Sunday to pick a new leader. It will be the second time in just over six months that voters in the south American country have cast ballots in a presidential election. Chavez, who ruled Venezuela for 14 years, celebrated a triumphant re-election victory in October. After his death on March 5, authorities announced new elections to select his successor. Who's running to replace Chavez? Nicolas Maduro, 50, is a candidate for the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. Henrique Capriles Radonski, 40, represents a coalition of opposition parties. Maduro started his career as a bus driver in Caracas, rose through the ranks as a union leader and eventually became part of Chavez's inner circle. He has been the interim leader since Chavez's death, and served as vice president and foreign minister in his administration. Capriles is the former governor of Miranda state. He lost to Chavez in October's presidential vote, coming within 10 percentage points of the longtime leader.

"(CNN) -- Proponents of same-sex marriage got a boost on two fronts Monday, when the governor of Washington signed a bill legalizing marriage for gay and lesbian couples and the New Jersey state Senate voted 24-16 in favor of a similar bill. The New Jersey bill now goes to the Assembly, which is slated to vote Thursday. ""We're cautiously optimistic"" about its chances for passage, said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for Garden State Equality, which has lobbied for the bill. But the legislation is threatened in both states. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said last month that the issue ""should not be decided by 121 people in the State House in Trenton."" Instead, he favors a statewide referendum. ""I think that this is not an issue that should rest solely in my hands, in the hands of the Senate president or in the hands of the speaker or the other 118 members of the Legislature,"" he said. ""Let's let the people of New Jersey decide what is right for the state."" If he vetoes the measure, ""the battle for overriding the veto begins,"" Goldstein said. Gov. Chris Gregoire's signature to legislation legalizing same-sex marriage added her state to a list that includes Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Iowa, New York and the District of Columbia. The law will go into effect in June, when the legislative session ends, but opponents have vowed to try to halt its implementation by putting it on the November ballot. That possibility did not appear to dampen the spirits of those who attended the bill-signing ceremony. ""We have finally said yes to marriage equality,"" Gregoire said to applause moments before signing the bill. ""It gives same-sex couples the same right to a marriage license as heterosexual couples."" She noted that churches are not required to perform same-sex marriages under the law and expressed confidence that, if put to a state-wide vote, Washingtonians would back the measure. ""I believe our Washingtonians will say yes because it's time for us to stand up for our sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters, our moms and dads, our friends and the couple down the road,"" she said. ""It is time to give our loving gay and lesbian couples the right to a marriage license in Washington state."" But the news for same-sex marriage advocates is not all positive. In states where legislators have passed Defense of Marriage Acts, which define marriage as being between a man and a woman only, they are taking defensive action. North Carolina is set to vote in a May primary election on such an act, and Minnesota is to hold such a vote in November. In 2009, Maine legislators passed a same-sex marriage bill that drew challenges by opponents who pushed for a referendum that ultimately overturned the law with 53% of the vote. Proponents are trying to get it back on the ballot this year. Gay rights advocates have garnered thousands of signatures in an effort to force a second referendum in November. In California, a 2008 public vote outlawed gay and lesbian couples' right to wed. Two years later, a federal district court overturned the voter-approved measure known as Proposition 8, saying couples were unfairly denied their rights. A federal appeals court ruled last week against California's ban, arguing that it unconstitutionally singles out gays and lesbians for discrimination. The ban has remained in place during the appeals process and could soon get a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar battles have unfolded in Maryland, where same-sex marriage opponents have pressed for referenda to counter bills that appear to enjoy growing support in their statehouse. The National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage, predicted that the referenda will block the marriages from taking place. ""Ultimately, the people are going to decide, and we're confident that the people will vote to protect marriage as the union between a man and a woman,"" President Brian Brown said. ""The legislature's decision is a decision against the will of the people."" Marriage, he said, is by definition the union of a man and a woman. ""The state did not create that definition; the state merely recognizes it."" Statewide votes are not the way to handle the issue, according to Thalia Zepatos, director of public engagement for Freedom to Marry. ""The question I like to pose to people is: Would you like the entire state to vote on whether you could marry your husband or wife?"" she asked. But the trend among Americans seems to be moving toward acceptance of the practice. A CNN/ORC International Poll carried out in September found that 53% of respondents said marriages between gay or lesbian couples should be recognized as valid, up from 44% in 2009. The poll had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. In September's poll, Democrats favored recognizing them as valid by 67% to 31%, independents by 53% to 46%. Just 30% of Republicans said they favored recognizing same-sex marriage as valid, versus 69% who did not. Those results had a sampling error of plus or minus 6 points.","Washington's governor signs a bill approving same-sex marriage .

"Washington (CNN) -- They are already lining up outside the U.S. Supreme Court for public seating at next week's oral arguments on same-sex marriage. People arrived on Thursday night when temperatures in the capital dipped into the 30s and had grown to about a half-dozen people by Friday afternoon. Those assembled at the base of the high court plaza were bundled in heavy coats and sitting in portable chairs. Groups will be allowed into the Supreme Court starting on Tuesday ahead of 10 a.m. ET arguments on California's voter-approved ban on gay marriage known as Proposition 8. A separate challenge to the federal law known as the Defense of Marriage Act will be argued Wednesday. There are about 250 seats for the general public for each. High-profile cases typically attract lines early on. Some are spectators, while others are place-holders for big law firms or advocacy groups. Last year, spectators also lined up the weekend before the Supreme Court heard arguments on the health care reform law. Two lines eventually form out front of the court's marble exterior, one for those who want to watch an entire argument and the other for those seeking a glimpse of the proceedings.","Arguments in two appeals set for next week in Washington .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court will tackle the contentious issue of same-sex marriage, agreeing to hear two constitutional challenges to state and federal laws dealing with the recognition of gay and lesbian couples to legally wed. In a one-page order on Friday, the court took on what will be one of the most important issues in its history. The decision to review the matter came just weeks after voters approved same-sex marriage in three states. Oral arguments will likely be held in March with a ruling by late June. One appeal to be heard involves the federal Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA, which denies federal benefits to same-sex couples legally married in their own state. The second is a challenge to California's Proposition 8, a voter-approved referendum that took away the right of same sex-marriage that previously had been approved by the state's courts. Same-sex married couple sues federal government in DOMA case . The political, social, and legal stakes of this long-simmering debate will once again put the high court at the center of national attention, a contentious encore to its summer ruling upholding the massive health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama. There are approximately 120,000 legally married same-sex couples in the United States. Earlier this month, voters in Maryland, Washington, and Maine approved same-sex marriage, adding to the six states and the District of Columbia that already had done so. Minnesota voters also rejected an effort to ban such unions through a constitutional amendment. Timeline: Same-sex marriage . Many other states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Delaware, Rhode Island and Hawaii, have legalized domestic partnerships and civil unions for such couples -- a step designed in most cases to provide the same rights of marriage under state law. But other states have passed laws or state constitutional amendments banning such marriages. California's Proposition 8 is the only such referendum that revoked the right after lawmakers and the state courts previously allowed it. In February, a federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled the measure unconstitutional. In its split decision, the panel found that Proposition 8 ""works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians"" by denying their right to civil marriage. The justices have discretion to rule narrowly or broadly on the aspects of the legal and procedural questions raised. The federal case deals with Edith Windsor, who was forced to pay an estate tax bill much larger than other married couples would have to pay when her partner died. Because her longtime partner was a woman, the federal government, in legal terms, did not recognize the same-sex marriage even though the couple's home state of New York did. The federal law does not prohibit states from allowing same-sex marriages, but it also does not force states to recognize them from other states. Other plaintiffs are federal workers, who are not allowed to add their spouses to health care plans and other benefits. Traditionally, the federal DOMA law would be defended by the Justice Department. But that responsibility would now fall to House Republicans after President Barack Obama declared his support for same-sex marriage earlier this year. In their order on Friday, the justices asked both sides to argue a supplemental question: Whether congressional Republicans -- operating as a bipartisan legal advisory group -- have ""standing,"" or legal authority, to make the case. The justices also asked both sides to argue a second standing question. California's governor and state attorney general have refused to defend Proposition 8 in court, leaving it to a private coalition of groups supporting the law to file the appeals. The high court could decide the standing question alone and dismiss the appeal without addressing the larger constitutional questions. That would mean for now, same-sex marriages could resume next year in California. Those on both sides of the issue welcomed the high court's intervention. ""That the issue will soon be heard by the Supreme Court is a vindication of our work to achieve equal protection under the law for same-sex couples,"" said Mary Bonauto, director of the Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, who has been litigating the issue for decades. ""This day has been long in the making, and we are committed to the success of this case."" But a group that helped lead the effort to pass Proposition 8 in California said it was confident of prevailing. ""We believe it is a strong signal that the court will reverse the lower courts and uphold Proposition 8,"" said John Eastman, chairman of the National Organization for Marriage. ""That is the right outcome based on the law and based on the principle that voters hold the ultimate power over basic policy judgments and their decisions are entitled to respect."" The cases accepted Friday are Hollingsworth v. Perry (12-144), dealing with Proposition 8; and U.S. v. Windsor (12-307) on the DOMA issue. PDF: Read the Windsor ruling the high court will consider .

"(CNN) -- The divisive issue of same-sex marriage in California may become another landmark case taken up by the U.S. Supreme Court after federal appeals court judges refused Tuesday to revisit an earlier ruling. The 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco denied a request to re-examine the issue, months after judges gave gay and lesbian couples constitutional blessing to wed in the state. A stay on same-sex marriages in California remains in place until the issue is exhausted in the courts. Stars talk marriage equality at Prop 8 play . In February, a three-judge panel of that court ruled the measure unconstitutional. In its split decision, the panel found that Proposition 8 ""works a meaningful harm to gays and lesbians"" by denying their right to civil marriage in violation of the 14th Amendment. Backers of the proposition had asked for a larger panel of judges to rehear the case. In a seven-page order Tuesday, the court refused. The parties now have 90 days to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene. Supporters of Proposition 8 vowed to appeal to the nation's highest court. ""Marriage is a universal good that has been honored by diverse cultures and faiths for the entire history of Western civilization,"" said Brian Raum, senior counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund. The organization is part of the legal defense team for ProtectMarriage.com, the banner organization for proponents of the measure. Fast facts: Same-sex marriage . ""The ProtectMarriage.com legal team looks forward to standing before the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of the people's right to preserve the fundamental building block of civilization, especially since the dissents accompanying today's decision strongly support our arguments. The democratic process and the most important human institution -- marriage -- shouldn't be overthrown based on the demands of Hollywood activists."" ""Millions of Californians who gave their time and treasure to protect marriage deserve better,"" said Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage. ""We are calling on the U.S. Supreme Court to preserve our democratic rights and overturn this action of judicial arrogance."" Gay-rights advocates, meanwhile, hailed the court's action. ""Today's refusal by the 9th Circuit to grant further review is a testament to the meticulous and well-reasoned opinion originally issued by the court,"" said Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights. Is same-sex marriage too radical for America? ""While the supporters of Proposition 8 will now seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court, there is no doubt that they are on the wrong side of history. Excluding same-sex couples from the right to marry runs counter to our highest ideals of equality and fairness."" ""Today's decision by the Ninth Circuit ... brings committed same-sex couples in California one step closer to being able to marry,"" said Evan Wolfson, president of the group Freedom to Marry. ""It's now been three and a half years since the freedom to marry was stripped from loving and committed same-sex couples. It is long past time for this 'gay exception' to marriage in California to come to an end."" CNN poll: Majority of Americans say they have gay friends, family members . The three-judge panel's ruling in February upheld a 2010 decision by a U.S. district judge in San Francisco. However, in the appeals court decision, Judges Stephen Reinhardt and Michael Daly Hawkins said that they were speaking only about Proposition 8 and that states would have to decide the marriage issue themselves. California's Supreme Court ruled that same-sex marriages were legal in 2008, before Proposition 8 went before voters. After the measure passed with 52% of the vote that year, its passage put an end to the practice. Last month, a federal appeals court in Massachusetts struck down a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act -- the law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage -- as unconstitutional. The issue before the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was whether the federal government could deny tax, health and pension benefits to same-sex couples in states where they can legally marry. The Massachusetts case could also soon be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Currently, same-sex marriage is legal in six states: Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, along with the District of Columbia. Washington and Maryland voted earlier this year to allow same-sex marriages, but the laws have not yet taken effect. Another five states -- Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey and Rhode Island -- allow civil unions, providing state-level spousal rights to same-sex couples. Last month, President Barack Obama, who previously opposed same-sex marriage, said that he now supports it. ""When I think about those soldiers or airmen or Marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that 'don't ask, don't tell' is gone, because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage, at a certain point I've just concluded that for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,"" the president told ABC. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People also announced last month that it supports same-sex marriage. The California cases are Perry v. Brown and Coleman v. Brown.","The parties now have 90 days to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court .

"(CNN) -- Shortly after the clock struck midnight, two Seattle women legitimized their 35-year love affair early Thursday by becoming the first same-sex couple to receive a marriage license in King County, Washington. The two women met on a blind date in 1977, when homosexuality was highly taboo and gay people socialized privately in homes, never in public. Now Pete-e Petersen is 85 and Jane Abbott Lighty is 77, and they have lived to see the world transformed. In the twilight of their lives, they thought they would die without being legally married, though they had a church wedding in 2005. But Washington voters approved Referendum 74, legalizing same-sex marriage, last month, allowing the first licenses to be issued on Thursday. ""Oh, my goodness!"" Lighty said. ""We've been together 35 years and seen all kinds of change."" ""It's been a long journey,"" Petersen said. ""We're so excited to know we'll get a license and then get married on Sunday."" Voters approve same-sex marriage for the first time . Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire and Secretary of State Sam Reed certified Referendum 74 Wednesday, surrounded by the marriage equality bill's supporters. ""This is a very important and historic day in the great state of Washington. For many years now, we've said, 'One more step. One more step.' This is our last step,"" Gregoire said. ""To the couples that are here today that will finally be treated with the equality they've deserved for many years, congratulations to each of you."" This year has been historic on many levels for the marriage equality movement. High court takes no action yet on same-sex marriage appeals . After years of saying no at the ballot box, American voters for the first time said yes to same-sex marriage this fall in Washington, Maryland and Maine. Marriage licenses for same-sex couples will begin being issued on December 29 in Maine and January 1 in Maryland. Voters in Minnesota rejected a measure that would have banned same-sex marriage. How has LGBT life changed over the years? Share your story. Those approvals contrast with the 38 states that have passed bans on marriages between people of the same sex, mostly by amending their constitutions to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman. In six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- and the District of Columbia, gays and lesbians have previously won marriage rights because of actions taken by judges or legislators, not voters. A milestone also occurred this year in the nation's executive branch: President Barack Obama became the first president to openly support same-sex marriage. These political trends emerged as a majority of Americans say they support legally recognizing same-sex marriage at a time when the public demonstrates increasing comfort with gays and lesbians, according to a CNN/ORC International survey in June. With 162 years between them, Petersen and Lighty can recall the dark days of being gay in America. ""Of course, we were in the so-called closet,"" Petersen said. ""Fortunately, we're blessed by nice looks so people didn't know right off the bat we were gay or homosexuals."" They can leverage the unpleasant moments into humor. After gay marriage successes, activists look to build on new faith outreach techniques . For example, Petersen was an Air Force nurse in the Korean War. Stationed in Japan, she flew all kinds of air missions to retrieve wounded troops in Korea and take them to Tokyo -- similar to what television's ""M*A*S*H"" depicted. She was eventually promoted to captain in the Air Force and also was put in charge of a clinic in San Antonio, Texas. During that time, she recalls the military hunts for gay men and women. Military brass never suspected her, she said. Lighty enjoyed the same illusion as a young woman. ""I was fortunate,"" Petersen said. ""We passed. ""People would come up in the hospital, and they were always hunting for gay people,"" she continued, talking about the military. Captain, the investigators asked, ""Do you have any ... people being gay here?"" ""I said, 'Not a one,'"" she recalled. ""It was just awful. It was a witch hunt, just really trying to oust people. If a military person, like an airman first class (woman), had short hair or walked like a tough person, they were questioning them and always quizzing them,"" Petersen said. ""I told them to leave them alone."" A preacher, a teacher, a soldier's parents, a GOP leader: Allies in marriage votes . Still, the couple honor Petersen's five years of military service every November 11. ""Yes,"" Lighty interjected, ""on Veterans Day, I have to stand up very straight and say, 'Ma'am!' all day long."" Petersen added: ""She has to say, 'Good morning, captain!' Lots of respect, and that has gone on for 35 years."" On their blind date at 5 p.m. on January 13, 1977, the couple rendezvoused for supper at an old town restaurant in Sacramento, California. A mutual friend arranged the date. Lighty cheated that evening: ""I stayed in the parking lot to see what she looked like as she got of the car,"" she said. ""I said she's cute and she's short."" Dinner was a success. ""Boy, we just hit it off,"" Petersen said. Two weeks later, they moved in together. Lighty had earlier been married to a man for two years. Petersen had adopted and was raising her sister's 10-year-old daughter. Their home also had two dogs and a cat. Victory for lesbian, years after her longtime partner's death . The couple wondered what they had gotten themselves into. At the time, Petersen and Lighty were nurses. In fact, Petersen was working in public health nursing, and was California's first nursing home ombudsman for the state Department of Public Health under then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, she said. By 1986, they had moved to Seattle, where they slowly came out of the closet in the late 1990s. First, they supported a gay men's choral group called the Seattle Men's Chorus. By the early 2000s, they started a lesbian counterpart, the Seattle Women's Chorus. In 2005, they announced to the world that they were longtime partners by participating in the documentary ""Inlaws & Outlaws,"" which examines the lives of straight and gay couples. On Sunday, the couple will marry onstage before the Seattle Men's Chorus and Seattle Women's Chorus at Benaroya Hall, home to the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. Two men who have been together for 23 years will also marry onstage, the two women said. When Petersen and Lighty tie the knot, the Women's Chorus will be singing from ""One Hand, One Heart"" from ""West Side Story."" As they approach the 36-year mark of being a couple, Petersen observed: ""We're just blessed with the people we've met and the opportunities we've had.""

"New York (CNN) -- New Yorkers are sweating-out a steamy summer thinking about sex. A pair of rogue politicians running for re-election and redemption leave them no choice. ""People have forgiveness in their hearts,"" said Eliot Spitzer, a former crime-fighting prosecutor and then governor who resigned in 2008 after revelations that he frequented prostitutes. Spitzer, who briefly joined us at CNN as a TV host during his exile from elected politics, began his comeback campaign this week with a surprise decision to run for comptroller of New York City. The job would essentially make him the Big Apple's accountant -- a huge demotion from his days running the entire state. He's sharing the city's summer-of-scandal spotlight with Anthony Weiner, a former Washington lawmaker who resigned from the House of Representatives in 2011 after acknowledging he sent sexually explicit photographs to several women. Weiner is running for mayor and would have to work closely with Spitzer if both men win. Could they? Both are Democrats -- a party that typically does well in New York -- and would first have to face a September vote for their party's nomination, even before the municipal election in November. Zombie politicians find new life after disgrace . Weiner represented a New York district in Congress and ran a credible campaign for mayor of the city back in 2005. Media accounts suggest he spent months planning this year's campaign. Polls make him the frontrunner among Democrats. By contrast, Spitzer started late and had a rough first week simply trying to collect enough signatures to get a place on the ballot. He also faced a particularly awkward opponent for the comptroller's office: an ex-madam who says she actually supplied Spitzer with women. Kristin Davis has no proof of that allegation but she did spend several months behind bars because of her business. Spitzer has to hope that it's something voters can overlook come September. Is the road to redemption getting shorter? ""Ten minutes in politics is 50 years in anything else,"" said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic strategist who has worked with Spitzer in the past. ""And anything can happen, all times, any time, forever."" The prospect of the disgraced duo running 'the city that never sleeps' hasn't escaped the attention of America's comedians.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Rihanna left no doubt about how she feels about Chris Brown and the probation he's serving for beating her up four years ago. The pop star sat behind Brown in court Wednesday while a prosecutor asked a judge to order the singer to restart the community labor that is his punishment for the felony assault conviction. It was Rihanna's second time in a courtroom with Brown. The first was the day in August 2009 when Brown was sentenced to five years' probation and ordered to stay away from her. Then, she was a witness for the prosecution. ""She thinks it's utterly ridiculous what they're doing to him,"" Brown lawyer Mark Geragos said when a reporter asked why his assault victim was in court. The Los Angeles County district attorney's office has ""tortured"" Brown during his probation worse than any client he's ever had, Geragos said. In a court filing this week, prosecutors accused Brown of not completing the 180 days of community labor ordered when he pleaded guilty to the felony assault charge. The paperwork Brown submitted to show he had completed community labor is ""at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting,"" District Attorney Jackie Lacey said. Brown wasn't in town on some of the dates reported, the motion said. Geragos, however, angrily disputed the charges, calling them ""absolutely false."" ""And I don't mean just false, it is fraudulent,"" Geragos said after the hearing. Brown's attorney said the prosecutor's filing was so fraudulent that he would ask the judge to punish the deputy district attorneys involved and call for a contempt of court hearing for filing false documents with the court. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin set a hearing for April 5 for Brown to return to court, but a full hearing on the allegations will be held later. The ever divisive Chris Brown . Brandlin ordered Brown to report to his probation officer within the next two days to be interviewed for a report that will be used at the hearing. Despite the serious allegations outlined in the court filing, the prosecutor is not asking for Brown's probation to be revoked and the singer sent to jail. She is asking the judge to order him to restart his 1,400 hours of community service under the supervision of a Los Angeles probation officer. Brown got an unusual deal when he pleaded guilty that allowed him to complete his court-ordered community service in Virginia, under the personal supervision of Richmond Police Chief Bryan Norwood. Normally, community service must be supervised by a probation office. The district attorney alleged that investigators he sent to Virginia discovered that Brown's mother supervised most of it, and they found evidence it was never done. In response, Geragos said he's received 10 e-mails in the past day from Richmond police officers and firefighters ""who observed Chris doing his community service."" ""I've got pictures, I've got witnesses,"" Geragos said. ""I've got what they don't have. We have evidence that he did it."" The motion also accused Brown of violating probation by punching singer Frank Ocean at a Hollywood recording studio last month, threatening to ""bust"" -- or shoot -- the singer. It also notes a Miami incident during which Brown allegedly stole a fan's cell phone and a chair-throwing incident after a ""Good Morning America"" interview. Also, Brown's claim to have medical marijuana license, which used to defend against a drug test result, was invalid because the acupuncturist who wrote it was not licensed to prescribe drugs, the motion said. This Friday marks the fourth anniversary of the night Brown punched Rihanna inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street, leaving her face bruised and bloody. Rihanna and Brown broke up after he was arrested for assaulting her, but they've made no secret in recent months that they are a couple again.","NEW: Rihanna ""thinks it's utterly ridiculous what they're doing to him,"" Brown's lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Perhaps you have done something like this at some stage in your life: you wake up late for work, hung-over, maybe still a little drunk. You throw on some clothes and report for duty. Maybe you even take a little pride in having gotten your act together so fast? Hopefully you didn't snort cocaine to clear your head, and hopefully you weren't piloting a commercial airliner either. This is how the morning goes for Captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington), who copes with an angry wake-up call from his ex-wife and then has to face down a storm on takeoff. As the saying goes, it's all down hill from here. An hour into the flight, the plane goes into a tailspin, and Whip has to use his expertise to execute a death-defying emergency landing. He's a national hero -- until the blood test results come in. With its spectacular plane crash -- I would rate it fractionally behind the air disasters director Robert Zemeckis staged in ""Cast Away"" and Joe Carnahan in ""The Grey,"" but still more than gut-wrenching enough to make you think about taking the train, next time -- ""Flight"" immediately raises the stakes on your typical addiction drama. But that's essentially what it is -- with a courtroom finish for extra lift. See, that title refers not just to one doomed trip, but also to Whip's pattern of evasion. In the aftermath, he steers as far as possible from public scrutiny, avoids even his own defense team, and like all addicts reserves his biggest lies for himself. The first thing he does when he wakes up in hospital is reach out to his supplier for a little extra-medicinal support (he's played by John Goodman with much the same gusto he brings to ""Argo""), but Whip refuses his offer of booze and goes on the wagon for a spell. That resolve crumbles when he realizes the kind of trouble he's in. When he picks up a fellow addict (Kelly Reilly) and offers her shelter in the out-of-the-way farm where he grew up, it's a toss-up whether he's trying to help or looking for a like-minded screw-up and enabler. The relationship is well-acted without ever quite dispelling the whiff of the screenwriting manual. And that goes for the movie as a whole, which is always expert and sometimes extremely tense, but maybe a bit too on the nose. This is a good movie, but not a great one. Still, Denzel Washington is very fine, packing some extra baggage around the midriff here, his customary swagger speckled with resentment and soulful self-doubt. Whip's a terrific pilot and a deeply flawed human being -- an atheist who will pray with a surviving crew-member if that's what it takes to secure a friendly witness for his hearing. It's not too often we find such questionable characters at the heart of big budget movies like this, and there's a lived-through-it quality to the movie's observations on alcoholism that helps ""Flight"" transcend its occasional cliches and even its cop-out sentimental ending. Zemeckis squeezes maximum suspense out of Whip's wobbly sobriety -- the mini-bar has never looked so sinister -- but even he has trouble disguising the hollow dilemma propping up John Gatins' story: Is it okay for a pilot to be drunk in charge of an aircraft? I think we all know the answer to that one.","""Flight"" stars Denzel Washington as a flawed airline pilot .

"(CNN) -- Dressed in eye-catching red costumes, a high-spirited troupe of barefoot acrobats storms across a dusty yard in the heart of Lusaka, Zambia's capital, their grinning faces painted with bright colors. Using an elaborate mix of flips, kicks and twists, the skilful performers sing and whistle as they dance their way onto a makeshift stage, while the pounding beats of skin drums and cheerful clapping summon scores of excited children from nearby neighborhoods towards the spectacle. They're all part of the Barefeet Theatre, an uplifting project that's aiming to transform the lives of street children and orphans in Zambia by using performing arts as a way of engaging youths who have suffered through poverty, drug use or other traumatic issues. Read also: Brass band keeps youngsters from gang life . Throughout the year, the group puts together a series of outreach events and workshops to help vulnerable kids participate in creative activities, such as theater, art, dance, music and storytelling. Organizers say they are all designed to help children express themselves, gain valuable information and ultimately prevent them from living on the streets. ""We engage the children with arts and theater to encourage their creativity and stimulate their curiosity,"" says Adam McGuigan, who founded Barefeet Theatre in 2006. ""We help holistically to their development and we see our interventions as crucial to any child's development -- as important as schooling, as accommodation or food."" Accidental beginnings . Back in the mid-2000s, McGuigan, a young artist hailing from the north of Ireland, left Europe to pursue his dream of taking a one-man street show to Africa. He embarked on his mission in South Africa, where he spent six months before heading north. But one month into his stay in Zimbabwe he was mugged and without most of his belongings, McGuigan had to get to the nearest Irish embassy, which was in Lusaka. And that's when everything changed. ""When I got here I had nothing planned, but I happened to come across a guy who was working with street kids in a center called Fountain of Hope in Lusaka,"" recalls McGuigan. ""So I came to do some workshops with these kids and it was absolutely incredible -- the energy, the passion, the enthusiasm and the talent that these kids had was just so infectious. ""At the same time I met a group of older guys who used to stay on the streets and were living at the center, and were also artists. So we were interested in how we could collaborate and work with these children. So it started very modestly and organically with just a few workshops and blossomed from there."" Read this: From the streets to break beats . From those initial sessions, Barefeet has grown into a group working with thousands of children, typically aged from seven to 20, in five cities across Zambia. The charity occupies its own office space, has a paid staff of more than a dozen people and receives funding from UNICEF. The group's members, many of whom used to live on the streets themselves, run a series of artistic modules focused on issues affecting vulnerable kids, from physical and emotional abuse to HIV/AIDS and other major problems. As part of their training, the children also have to work together to stage performances for their communities, using the skills and information they gained during the workshop sessions. ""That's when you can instil all the information and internalize it,"" says McGuigan. ""And then it's more lasting."" The group's performances culminate in its annual Youth Arts Festival, a vibrant 10-day event at the end of August where children from across Zambia meet up to sing, dance and perform in front of enthusiastic onlookers. Held in various locations in Lusaka, the popular get-together includes a colorful carnival procession as well as an array of performances and art exhibitions that give children a platform to showcase their talents while highlighting the dangers of life on the streets. 'I thought that's the end of my life' In Zambia, loss of parents, poverty and family breakdown have pushed thousands of children onto the streets. According to UNICEF data, there are 1.2 million orphans under the age of 15 in the country, 800,000 of whom are affected by HIV and AIDS. In many cases, children take to the streets to try to earn money for school fees or supplement their family income. Exposed to cruel living conditions, many start begging and stealing while others resort to drug use. ""Once you get sucked into that life, it is quite hard to disengage yourself,"" says McGuigan. ""Once you're full time in the street, you're open to a whole world of abuse -- sexual, physical, psychological,"" he adds. ""It's survival; it's really going from day to day trying to get food, trying to get enough money for drugs."" Read this: Bamboo bikes put Zambian business on right track . As former street children themselves, many of Barefeet's performers are well aware of the neglect and abuse suffered by many of their beneficiaries. ""I was born in a family of five, of which I was the last born,"" says Barefeet facilitator Chembe Mwanza, one of the group's success stories. ""My mother died when I was three months old so my dad had to marry another wife, which became my step mother."" Mwanza's step mother disowned him when he was only eight, forcing him to run away to Lusaka and fend for himself. ""I got stranded, I never knew where to start from,"" says Mwanza, whose drumming now accompanies the group's energetic performances. ""I was left alone, I never knew anyone -- I just felt so lost, I thought that's the end of my life."" It all changed when Mwanza was 14 and saw the Barefeet crew for the first time. ""They were just making different scowls, and they just have different energies and their stories,"" he remembers. ""They were advocating for children that live on the street. It gave me confidence so I can stand."" 'Life-changing effects of art' For most children living on the streets, entertainment is a rarity. That's why the Barefeet troupe regularly pops up unannounced in low-income areas, attracting at-risk youth with their dancing, singing and drumming. The performers say the troupe sees itself as a conduit for providing help. Any child in need can be connected with other NGOs or local professionals able to provide care. The genius is that none of the group's activities looks like serious work so children are more likely to play along without realizing they are being offered help. Looking ahead, McGuigan says the group's dream is to turn its festival into a global hub where youth can come to perform and collaborate with Zambian artists, as well as share skills and experiences about issues affecting children in different parts of the world. ""We want our festival in the heart of Africa to be a hub for other young advocates and artists across the world who can come here and see whether they can be inspired by the life-changing effects of art in our country,"" says McGuigan.","Barefeet Theatre uses performing arts to engage with street children in Zambia .

"(CNN) -- ""You won't believe what just happened!"" It's usually a phrase that precedes gossip, but it takes an entirely different meaning when you hear it from a head of state. That's what a Central American president told me in February of 2010. I was covering the Summit of Unity in the beach resort of Cancun, Mexico. Latin American and Caribbean presidents were in attendance. The aforementioned president, whose name I will not publish for obvious reasons, had just walked out of a closed-door meeting attended by several Latin American heads of state. What he told me next was unprecedented, as far as I know, in the realm of Latin American diplomacy. ""We almost had a fistfight,"" the president said. At first, he wouldn't say who was involved, but after persistent questioning by several of us reporters he finally disclosed that then- Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and his Venezuelan counterpart Hugo Chavez had an argument that escalated into a shouting match, and were it not for their colleagues present, would have ended up in a fight. I left it at gossip at first, but Chavez himself later confirmed it. In an interview with CNN en Espanol, the shoot-from-the-hip leftist leader, now relaxed and smiling, told the story. ""I think that if the table hadn't been there as an obstacle and our friends weren't sitting right there, president Uribe physically would have attacked me,"" Chavez said. By then, Chavez had already assumed the role of provocateur-in-chief in Latin American politics -- a title previously held by former Cuban president Fidel Castro until he ceded power to his younger brother Raul due to illness in 2006. That confrontation was not the first time that Chavez had a run-in with a foreign leader. The Venezuelan firebrand caused none other than Spanish King Juan Carlos to lose his patience. The king, normally polished and refined as it's proper for his stature, shouted at Chavez: ""Why don't you just shut up!"" after the Venezuelan president called Spanish Primer Minister Jose Maria Aznar a fascist several times at an Ibero-American summit held in Chile in November of 2007. I started wondering how such a renegade lacking diplomatic skills, former coup conspirator who served time in jail and supporter of an economic model that had already failed in the world had become so popular in Latin America? What was it about Chavez that made him electrifyingly popular in his homeland and leftist circles in Latin America? And then I remembered Chapeu Mangueira. I had traveled to Brazil in early 2010 and visited some slums on the hills surrounding Rio de Janeiro. These slums, known in Brazil as favelas, are a stone's-throw away from the main tourist attractions in Rio, like Copacabana Beach. Chapeu Mangueira was one of those slums where people lived in shacks, survived on pennies a day, lacked access to basic services and, in general, lived in extreme poverty and marginalized from the rest of society. I also remembered Chimalhuacan, a slum in Mexico City that mirrors Chapeu Mangueira. I thought as well of Ciudad Bolivar, a barrio in Bogota, the Colombia capital -- that is just as marginalized and poor. The Venezuelan capital has its own favelas. Petare, a shantytown in western Caracas, is a painfully sobering example. This is where the poor among the poor in Venezuela live. It's an area that had been ignored and marginalized for decades. After coming to power in 1999, Chavez focused on developing welfare programs for the poor. The programs, called misiones sociales, have measurably reduced poverty in places like Petare. Chavez killed two birds with one stone. He transformed the politically apathetic PetareÃ±os into fierce Chavistas who voted en masse and took to the streets to celebrate Chavez as his power increased, and to show support after he announced he was suffering from cancer in June of 2011. The poor, traditionally ignored and marginalized by Latin American politicians, became Chavez's main political weapon. It is true that Chavez squandered oil revenues (estimated at $120 billion a year), scared away investment by nationalizing foreign and domestic companies and neglected the Venezuelan infrastructure. Spending $30 billion a year in social programs (used as government propaganda) while driving away foreign investment is unsustainable in the long term. He managed to stack the Supreme Court with loyalists who ruled consistently in his favor. Socialist policies that undermined production and produced shortages of basic food products also fueled inflation, while a depreciation of the currency shortly before Chavez's death promised to worsen those problems. Venezuela still has one of the highest murder rates in the hemisphere. More recently, Chavez had taken steps to revoke the license of the last opposition TV network in the country. Human rights groups consistently raised alarms that Chavez was using the judicial system as a political tool to repress the opposition and silence dissent. ""By his second full term in office, the concentration of power and erosion of human rights protections had given the government free rein to intimidate, censor, and prosecute Venezuelans who criticized the president or thwarted his political agenda,"" New York-based Human Rights Watch said this week, adding that the Chavez government had shown ""open disregard for basic human rights guarantees."" Regardless, Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner eulogized the fallen leftist leader on her Twitter account by saying that ""The great legacy of Chavez is the social inclusion of millions of Venezuelans that used to be invisible and today are protagonists."" I would argue his legacy goes beyond that. An argument could be made that the Cuban economy would have collapsed without the oil it gets from Venezuela. Chavez also ushered in a new area of populist leaders including Rafael Correa in Ecuador, Evo Morales in Bolivia and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. They have all borrowed Chavez's playbook by catering to the poor and railing against the United States, a country they call ""the evil empire."" They all benefited from cheap oil from Venezuela while Chavez made allies who helped him slowly but surely tilt Latin American politics to the left. But, for the outside world, at least, the inclusion of the poor will probably remain at the top of Chavez's legacy. The formula is so simple it makes you wonder why nobody though of it before. After all, a 22-year-old single mother of two in Petare, Chapeu Mangueira, Chimalhuacan or Ciudad Bolivar, doesn't care about macroeconomic policies or free market economies, but about a leader who will make it possible to feed her children tomorrow. And to millions of Venezuelans, that was Hugo Chavez.","Chavez fashioned himself as provocateur-in-chief in Latin American politics .

"(CNN) -- It never fails, put out a list of favorite whatevers and it will ignite a firestorm of flaming opinions. What sparked the frenzy this time? A list of five cool destinations for airplane geeks and roto heads -- um, I mean aviation enthusiasts. Honestly no list is ever going to satisfy this crowd. Everyone has their OWN list, as shown by CNN commenters who wrote questions like, ""What about Oshkosh?"" ""Don't forget San Diego."" ""Hey, check out what they have at Oregon's Evergreen."" Their energy and excitement punched through the page, proof of the passion that powers aviation fans, including the closet geeks who fly under the radar. Related story: These people really love to fly . Indiana . Some of the comments yielded the unexpected. About three hours southeast of Chicago, there's a big surprise in the tiny town of Peru, Indiana -- population 11,417. CNN commenter lastdomino pointed out Grissom Air Museum as an ""off-the beaten path gem."" Indeed you are correct, lastdomino! This gem has three aircraft crown jewels: . --An F-102 variant trainer jet called the TF-102A that was flown by a young Air National Guardsman by the name of George W. Bush, according to museum officials. --A sharp F-100C Super Sabre fighter plane that the museum says was formerly piloted by some guy named Neil Armstrong. Later, he went on to be the first man to walk on the moon. --A World War II-era B-25J bomber named Passionate Paulette, which you may have already seen -- if you've ever watched the classic 1970 film ""Catch-22."" ""If you're ever close ... definitely worth the trip,"" lastdomino wrote. The place where dead airplanes come back to life . Ohio . To the east of Indiana near Dayton, Ohio, lies the aviation museum that rivals the Smithsonian, and which some say surpasses it. An avalanche of CNN comments raved about the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, which is sometimes mistakenly referred to as Wright-Patterson Air Force Museum because of its location at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Not to oversell it, but this place bills itself as ""the world's largest and oldest military aviation museum."" CNN commenter Mark Swanson showed his enthusiasm when he wrote: ""You need to get to the presidential exhibit hangar at the Air Force Museum in Dayton to see the cool stuff. We've been everywhere else, like Pima [Air & Space Museum] and AMARG, [aka The Boneyard], but this hangar is mecca for all true believers in the First Church of Aircraft Worship."" The star of the exhibit Swanson is referring to is a Boeing VC-137C called SAM (Special Air Mission) 26000. It's safe to say this is one of the most historic aircraft in the world. It's the jet that served as Air Force One for President Kennedy's 1963 trip to Cold War Berlin, where he made his famous ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" speech. It's the aircraft where Lyndon Johnson took the presidential oath of office after Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. It's the plane that ferried President Nixon to Beijing in 1972 to open U.S.-Chinese relations, triggering events that still affect us. Not enough White House for ya? This place also houses planes that flew Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. Other aircraft include the downright weird XF-85 Goblin, a stubby little so-called ""parasite fighter"" developed to protect bombers after World War II. Wisconsin . Commenter XR1138 clearly loves the famous airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. As a teen, XR watched aviation hall of famer Clarence ""Bud"" Anderson perform ""the most incredible display of piloting skill and energy management that I have ever seen and probably will never see again."" Officially, it's called 2012 AirVenture Oshkosh. It started as a gathering of 150 people and a handful of airplanes in 1953 and has blown up as one of sport aviation's top-drawer events, attracting more than a half-million visitors each year, according to its website. This year the airshow is set for July 23-29, and as usual, more than 10,000 spectacular aircraft from around the globe are expected to fly in for the Badger State's world-famous aerial celebration. ""I personally met [""miracle on the Hudson"" pilot] Capt. Sully [Sullenberger], [legendary test pilot] Chuck Yeager, and [Apollo 13 commander] Jim Lovell at AirVenture 2011,"" posted commenter NoKidding111. ""Hope all you fellow 'airplane geeks' can make it.  If you haven't been - you WILL NOT regret it."" California and Oregon . Two suggestions from CNN commenters were destinations on the West Coast. San Diego Air & Space Museum boasts one of only five Convair YF2Y-1 Sea Darts ever produced. What sets the Sea Dart apart? Waterskiis! This unusual figher jet was designed as the ""first combat-type plane equipped with retractable hydro-skis, the first delta-winged seaplane and the first supersonic seaplane in the world,"" according to the museum. In McMinnville, Oregon, the Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum is the home of Howard Hughes' obsession -- that amazing wooden behemoth dubbed the Spruce Goose.

"(CNN) -- Ayat Al-Qassab carefully slipped the beaded satin wedding gown over her small frame. She peered at herself in the rusted mirror and cautiously smiled. For a moment, her war-torn world was transformed and she was a beautiful bride -- free, safe and happy. Boom! A mortar shell exploded somewhere near her Syrian home in Homs, waking her from a daydream. She quickly wrapped a white headscarf tightly around her hair and prepared to leave for her wedding. Only a week earlier, Al-Qassab met her husband-to-be, Mohammad Jumbaz. Their families had coordinated the introduction. He was a pastry chef and part-time fighter for the rebel Free Syrian Army which wants to oust President Bashar al-Assad. She was 18 and from a family who didn't like the al-Assad government. They took no lingering looks across the room, and time didn't stand still when their eyes met. They simply chatted as Syria's nearly 20-month-old civil war rumbled in the background. ""I had a feeling in my heart,"" Jumbaz said, recalling that day. ""I cannot describe it to you."" During the interview, a shell boomed in the distance. ""In a time when we are under siege and there are sounds like this, I told my mother I decided to fulfill half my religion and to get married,"" he said, ""and without ever even seeing my bride, everything went perfect."" Al-Qassab agrees. ""We saw each other and we liked each other,"" she said, ""and in just one week we were married to each other."" Marriage as revolution . Homs has borne the brunt of the Syrian military's wrath since violence broke out nearly two years ago in the nation. Many who live in the city consider it to be the unbowed guardian of the Syrian revolt. A massacre in the spring killed scores of women and children. There, even marriage is an act of revolution. ""We must get married. Our lives must continue,"" Jumbaz said defiantly. ""We have not surrendered, and we will not surrender. This is a promise. A promise we will keep, God willing."" Out of respect for the dead, the couple held a small ceremony in the family apartment rather than a traditional large and noisy Syrian wedding. ""It was not appropriate to dance and play music,"" Jumbaz said. ""We recently received the body of my martyred brother, and many other families have martyrs as well. So it was a small family affair."" Speaking via Skype, the couple seems to have little interest in chatting about romance or the frivolities of weddings. Instead, both are enthralled with their love for revolution and an ancient country that appears lost to war and strife. ""I wore a white dress, but we did not have a traditional wedding because of this animal in power,"" Al-Qassab said. ""We hope once the regime falls we can have a wedding, because our happiness is the end of this government."" The couple spent their honeymoon at home, struggling to survive as al-Assad's forces relentlessly shelled Homs. But Al-Qassab said she is very happy to stay. ""Here, we have our pride and we are defending our nation,"" she said. ""I would prefer my honeymoon to be here amid the bombs and shells then for me to abandon my nation."" In the Middle East, where arranged marriages are common, there is an Arabic word for love after marriage: ""ashra."" It means the love from living life together. It is emotion based on mutual respect, understanding and a need for a partner to survive all life's struggles. ""I am not upset that I got married under these circumstances,"" Al-Qassab said. ""The opposite. I am proud that I married one of the revolutionaries, and I am proud to be here in old Homs defending my nation and my dignity."" Now, after more than a year and a half of violence, living life amid the constant killing and dying is the greatest form of rebellion for the couple. ""I took this step, because I am a man who has faith in God and destiny,"" Jumbaz said. ""The days that passed were very hard on us. I still thank God for everything, but I felt something was missing in my life. I do not know how to describe it. ""Every day was a struggle, but something was missing."" A baker becomes a fighter . Before the Syrian civil war turned Homs into a conflict zone, Jumbaz owned a baked-sweets business, selling cakes and candy to the mainly pro-government Allawi and Christian districts near his native neighborhood in Homs' Old District. ""When my brother was killed, I decided to return to my community and support my people, because what was happening was unjust,"" he said. ""Seventy percent of my friends have been killed in this and that massacre. This is an unbearable level of injustice."" Al-Assad must be tried for war crimes, he believes. Jumbaz joined the rebel Free Syrian Army and fought alongside other members of the armed opposition to liberate an opposition enclave in Homs. While the Old District remains under siege and constantly sustains shelling and mortar fire, Syrian troops remain outside the neighborhood, stationed along the outskirts of the suburb. ""There are enough Free Syrian Army troops to protect us now, but I noticed how difficult the situation is around us,"" Jumbaz said. Now, Jumbaz spends his days kneading rations of flour and bits of butter into dough, creating sweet, creamy Syrian desserts. ""The kids wanted sweets and many of the women were craving desserts, so I am trying to bake sweets again,"" he said. Faithful and not afraid . Al-Qassab said she visits her parents and relatives every day to help with household duties, and she checks on the well-being of her neighbors until the evening, when her new husband returns home. ""I am not afraid of anything happening to him, and I thank God. We are all willing to sacrifice our lives for Syria,"" Al-Qassad said. ""I thank God above all else."" Another single loud explosion thundered in the background as they spoke. The couple didn't even flinch. ""I pray no one is hurt"" Jumbaz calmly said. He turned to his wife, who wore a faded purple coat and tight black headscarf. ""Please, go ahead,"" he said, kindly signaling her to speak. ""We will not surrender, God willing,"" she said. ""We are walking along the righteous path. My cousins, my neighbors, the children of my neighbors all died, and many more have lost their lives. But I am not sad. We will be victorious in this life and the afterlife."" Al-Qassab looks older than her 18 years, and she speaks with impenetrable courage and bravery that generally masks any semblance of a giggling blushing bride only a few weeks into her marriage. ""We were married September 13, 2011,"" she said before finally cracking a smile and beginning to laugh. ""I mean 2012."" She turns to her husband, blushing and embarrassed. He looks down to hide that he is laughing, too, instead mumbling to correct her: ""2012."" Nothing it seems but sheer faith in God moves the newlyweds and inspires them to love, and to fight and resist forces in Syria they feel must end. After nearly every sentence, they defiantly say ""Alhamdulillah,"" a common Muslim phrase meaning ""I thank God."" ""My only hope is that this monster will be removed from power so we can live in peace and our children can live in peace,"" Al-Qassab starts. ""And if not our kids, then the children of our community even if we die,"" her husband adds. ""Alhamdulillah.""","Many Syrians are determined to live their lives despite a war ravaging their nation .

"(CNN) -- The first CIA agents landed in Afghanistan on September 26, 2001, beginning direct American efforts to overthrow the Taliban. Ten years later, the United States is still fighting the Taliban, and the recent assassination of Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of Afghanistan's High Peace Council, shows that we are far from total victory. The terrorist training camps are gone and al Qaeda's top leaders are dead or on the run. Nonetheless, Afghanistan remains riddled with violence, corruption and hatred. The citizens of Afghanistan continue to suffer from crushing poverty, immobility and intimidation. President Obama in June made it clear that the United States would not continue to fight indefinitely in Afghanistan. The president announced that he would withdraw about one-third of the roughly 100,000 American soldiers in Afghanistan by summer 2012. He also pledged a fuller disengagement by 2014, when ""the Afghan people will be responsible for their own security."" Subsequent discussions revealed that the White House expected to keep no more than 25,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about half the U.S. deployment in Germany. After 10 long years, American withdrawal from Afghanistan is wise and necessary. An open-ended commitment is unsustainable in the face of global recession, excessive U.S. government debt and pressing political challenges in Libya, Egypt, Syria and Iran -- just to name a few crucial countries. The United States must disengage from Afghanistan and focus its resources elsewhere. The real question is how the United States should withdraw and what it should leave behind. How can we make sure the sacrifices of the last 10 years are not betrayed after we leave? How can we help ensure against a reversion to the conditions in Afghanistan that allowed the 9/11 terrorists to train and take refuge? The United States has extensive experience with these questions, from our difficult interventions over the last century. In the Philippines, Germany, Japan, and to a certain extent, Iraq, American investments in nationwide elections, in a multiparty legislature and in a respected judiciary have brought some legitimacy to the government. This is a very mixed history with few ""victories,"" but some insights that might help with our withdrawal from Afghanistan. Hedge your bets. American leaders have a tendency to invest heavily in friendly strongmen, like Ngo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam, Shah Reza Pahlavi in Iran and Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan. These figures initially look reliable and morally attractive as courageous leaders of anti-communist and anti-Taliban efforts. Extensive American support, however, becomes corrupting, increasing the isolation and dictatorial qualities of Washington's chosen allies. In the end, dependence on strongmen discredits American power. As American soldiers leave Afghanistan, they must not ""hand over"" power to Karzai or any similar figure. Instead, the United States must work hard in the next year to build deeper ties with diverse local leaders, many of whom oppose both the Taliban and Karzai at the same time. The United States should encourage power-sharing between groups, and it should avoid dependence on Karzai for security after 2012. Afghanistan needs more federalism across regions and less centralization in Kabul. Build institutions. America's long history of foreign interventions proves that local insurgents can outlast our soldiers. As in Afghanistan, the United States will eventually bring its troops home, but the insurgents have nowhere to go. They can stay under cover, re-group and re-emerge after the Americans leave. That is precisely the dynamic with the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan. If American soldiers cannot outlast the insurgents, American-supported institutions can. In the Philippines, Germany, Japan, and to a certain extent, Iraq, where American investments in nationwide elections, in a multiparty legislature and in a respected judiciary have brought some legitimacy to the Iraqi government. It is the joint businesses, the public works and especially the schools that changed society in the most enduring and beneficial ways. These institutions are also the most likely to draw local participation and popular endorsement. Money devoted to infrastructure and schools is well spent, especially as foreign military forces are reduced. Nurture regional stability. American efforts in Afghanistan are threatened most by the extremism and violence in Pakistan. Although an official ally of the United States, Pakistan has provided sanctuary for terrorists, including Osama bin Laden, and the leaders of the Taliban. Pakistan has contributed to the corruption and intimidation in Afghanistan that oppress citizens seeking a better way of life. The United States must put more pressure on Pakistan to play a productive role in the region. We must insist that the billions of dollars we send to Islamabad are not diverted to meddling in Afghanistan. Instead, the Pakistani military and intelligence agencies must work to apprehend terrorists, especially on their own soil, and they must enforce a cessation of violence on the key trade and communications routes into and out of Afghanistan. We cannot ask the Pakistanis to abandon their sympathies for some extreme Islamic parties, including elements of the Taliban, but we can insist that they help to maintain order, stability, and openness in the region. Although Americans must withdraw from Afghanistan, they must do so in a way that supports positive changes. We must give Afghans the chance to run a functioning nation-state of their own. For all the difficulties of the last 10 years, there are real achievements -- including the establishment of political stability in the Northern provinces and the reduction in country-wide poverty -- to build on. Progress in withdrawal is possible and it will not cost very much. It will certainly come at less expense than a reversion of Afghanistan to the terrorist haven it was in September 2001. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Jeremi Suri.","Jeremi Suri: When we leave Afghanistan, 10 years of progress could be lost .
Suri: We must not hand over power to a strongman, like Karzai, which discredits U.S.
We must insist Pakistan fights extremism within its borders and without, Suri writes .
We must invest in institutions, public works, he says, and especially schools ."
"(CNN) -- Seoul-born, 71-year-old Japanese architect Toyo Ito is this year's recipient of the industry's most coveted prize. On Monday, the architect was announced the 2013 Pritzker Architecture Prize winner, joining past Pritzker Laureates that include Frank Gehry, Tadao Ando and Rem Koolhaas. ""As I did not expect it, I felt really grateful and honored to be awarded the prize,"" Ito told CNN. In addition to his abstract, beautiful buildings, the Tokyo-based architect is also known for his extensive work on communal centers as part of the reconstruction in Japan following the 2011 tsunami. Ito, whose family ran a miso (bean paste) factory following his father's early death when Ito was 12, has said he wasn't interested in architecture as a youth.

"(CNN) -- The airline industry's latest tactic to increase revenue -- charging premiums for window and aisle seats -- is making it hard for groups to fly together, say passenger advocates. George Hobica, founder of travel site AirfareWatchdog, said his organization had received a spate of complaints from Americans who had struck problems being seated together on flights. Complainants included a woman who had been unable to sit next to her husband, who had a medical condition. He said the problems were arising as airlines set aside more desirable window and aisle seats for passengers who pay a premium, leaving those who do not pay with center-row seats, separated from other members of their party unless they have paid the surcharge. ""The airlines are basically trying to squeeze out more fees in the face of higher costs, and it is inconveniencing a lot of passengers,"" said Hobica. The charges for window or aisle seats in the front half of the plane, costing as much as $29 each way on U.S. domestic flights and $59 on international flights, are the latest of a raft of passenger fees introduced in recent years as the airline industry looks to generate new streams of revenue. See also: In-flight phone calls to become standard . The issue has arisen in the United States, where Delta, American Airlines, and low-cost carriers US Airways, Frontier, Spirit and Allegiant have implemented charges for ""preferred seating."" Delta spokeswoman Katie Hulme said the move reflected the fact that some seats were more desirable than others, and that it gave passengers greater choice and flexibility in where they were seated. ""Offering preferred seats for sale to all Delta passengers means that we are offering different seat selection options to enable more passengers to travel in their seat of choice,"" she said. See also: Airline seat squeeze: It's not you . The notion of paying extra to reserve more desirable seating is catching on more widely across the industry. Across the Atlantic, low-cost Ryanair rolled out reservations for certain seats across all its routes in January, while its rival Easyjet has also been experimenting with the practice. The implementation of end-of-row seat fees is part of a broader airline trend to charge for amenities previously included in the standard fare, such as movies, water, pillows and blankets. In response to soaring fuel prices four years ago, airlines also began introducing charges for checked baggage, generating huge sums. But last year the revenue from checked bags for U.S. airlines fell for the first time, suggesting passengers were trying to avoid fees by packing light when they traveled. Two U.S. airlines, Spirit and Allegiant, also charge passengers for carry-on baggage. Hobica said part of the airlines' rationale was ""to cater to the people that have paid the most for their seats."" See also: Seat-review sites put fliers in prime position . Kate Hanni, of passenger rights organization FlyersRights, said the aisle and window surcharges made air travel an even more daunting prospect for families. ""Families have already been having a hard time, so this is the icing on the cake,"" she said. ""Can you imagine getting on a plane and not being seated next to your three-year-old?"" While gate staff would typically try to seat families together, removing aisle and window seats as options was making this impossible, said Hanni. ""The predictability of air travel has really gone away. This is one more layer where people can't predict what's going to happen -- it's a crap shoot,"" she said. ""They're holding the aisle and window seats out for higher prices -- and trust me, this is just a revenue grab."" Hobica said while the new price structure was causing problems, he could understand the logic behind it. ""When you buy a ticket to a Broadway show, you do pay more for better seating,"" he said. ""If passengers were willing to pay higher fares at the beginning,"" he said, the problems could be avoided. Hulme said that the number of rows in which window and aisle seats were set aside as ""preferred seating"" varied from aircraft to aircraft, but did not extend through the entire plane. Many of those who traveled in groups were leisure travelers who tended to book their fares in advance, and should encounter few difficulties being seated together, she said.

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court has the most powerful judges in the United States. But common citizens are often behind pivotal cases that those justices decide -- everyday Americans who, by taking their cases to court, made history. America was reminded of that this week, when the high court ruled in favor of Edith Windsor. She's an 84-year-old New York woman who sued to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act so that the federal government would recognize her marriage to her late partner, Thea Spyer. On a much broader scale, the case was aimed to ensure that legally wed same-sex spouses could get the same benefits as traditional male-female ones. Windsor may be the latest, but she's not the first American whose name is linked to Supreme Court rulings that have altered society. Below are a few such examples from the country's more than two centuries in existence. WHO: William Marbury . CASE: Marbury v. Madison (1803) HIS STORY: Just before he left office, President John Adams commissioned William Marbury -- among dozens of others -- to become a justice of the peace. But his secretary of state didn't follow through. And when James Madison took over that position, he didn't either -- but purposefully, per the direction of new President Thomas Jefferson, who didn't want members of the opposing political party to take office. So Marbury sued. Chief Justice John Marshall issued the landmark ruling in the case. In the short term, he decided Marbury would not become a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia, as he'd wished. But the opinion proved far more significant, long term, because it established judicial review -- the idea the courts could strike down laws and the like it deemed unconstitutional. As Marshall wrote, ""A Law repugnant to the Constitution is void."" WHO: Dred Scott . CASE: Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) HIS STORY: Dred Scott was born a slave in Virginia. He and his family later were moved with their owners to Alabama and eventually Missouri, where he was sold to a U.S. Army doctor. Together, they moved around -- including in the free territory of Wisconsin -- before ending up back in Missouri. Scott was there when his owner died, after which he sued in St. Louis city court for his freedom -- saying that, for some time at least, he had been free. So was Scott his own man, or was he still the property of his late owner's widow? The Supreme Court ruled it was the latter, that as a slave he didn't have the rights as white Americans. That included the right to sue in federal court. Chief Justice Roger Taney wrote, ""We think they are ... not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word 'citizens' in the Constitution, and can therefore claim none of the rights and privileges which that instrument provides for."" WHO: Homer Plessy . CASE: Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) HIS STORY: In June 1892, Homer Plessy sat down in the whites-only compartment of a train rolling through Louisiana. A conductor challenged him, and he was arrested for violating state law. He was â…ž white, not 100% that he'd need to avoid a $25 fine or 20 days in jail. As with others involved in some landmark cases, Plessy was not necessarily caught off guard: He'd been among a group working with the Eastern Louisiana Railroad Company to protest the state law requiring rail companies to provide ""separate but equal"" places for white and nonwhite customers, and for patrons to follow suit. The Supreme Court eventually got the case, which had to do not just with Plessy's arrest but more generally state and local Jim Crow laws that had institutionalized segregation including in much of what had been the former Confederacy. Justice Henry Brown, in his majority ruling, upheld such laws in calling it a ""fallacy (to assume) enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority."" WHO: The Brown family . CASE: Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954) THEIR STORY: There was a school seven blocks from Linda Brown's Topeka, Kansas, home, but she couldn't go to it. But because the third-grader was black, and Sumner Elementary was all-white, she had to walk several blocks and catch a bus to attend Monroe Elementary. Her father Oliver and other parents petitioned for their children to attend Sumner, then sued to city's board of education after they were denied. The Browns were the first name listed on that lawsuit. They would later become the name at the front of the Supreme Court's milestone ruling, even as others fought the same fight: In December 1952, the court had similar cases on its docket from Delaware, South Carolina, Virginia and the District of Columbia. Chief Justice Earl Warren's decision effectively overturned the Plessy v. Ferguson that an earlier Supreme Court had passed decades before, which had helped make segregation possible. ""The doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place,"" Warren wrote. ""Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."" WHO: Ernesto Miranda . CASE: Miranda v. Arizona (1966) HIS STORY: Ernesto Miranda was in his Phoenix home in 1963 when police came, arrested him and took him to a police station. There, a witness identified the truck driver as the culprit in a kidnapping and rape. So did Miranda himself, in writing -- a confession that was taken into account during his trial, which ended with a guilty verdict. Miranda challenged that conviction by insisting his confession was invalid. Why? Because, he argued, he had made it without being advised by police of his right to remain silent and to have a lawyer working with him. The Supreme Court got Miranda's case (among others involving suspects alleging they hadn't been properly about self-incrimination prior to being interrogated), and ruled in his favor. Thus was born what's now known as a Miranda warning, in which suspects are told they don't have to talk to police and have the right to an attorney, whether they can afford one or not. Miranda's victory, though, was short-lived. He was retried, and once again convicted, in 1967. After getting out after two stints in jail, he was stabbed to death in January 1976 in a fight over a $3 gambling pot. WHO: Mildred and Richard Loving . CASE NAME: Loving v. Virginia (1967) THEIR STORY: In many ways, Mildred Jeter and Richard Loving were like any other couple. They'd been childhood sweethearts who tied the knot in 1958 in Washington, D.C., then went back to their home state of Virginia. But their wedded bliss was interrupted one night when police broke into their bedroom and arrested them. Their crime? Mildred was black and Richard was white, at a time when interracial marriage was illegal in Virginia and other states. The Lovings got out of a pending jail sentence after agreeing to move to Washington. Yet they pressed their case that their marriage, and those of other mixed-race couples, should be valid in the United States. In a 1967 decision, Chief Justice Earl Warren agreed, thus opening the door for all interracial marriages. ""Marriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental to our very existence and survival,"" he wrote, citing an earlier case. ""To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law."" WHO: Norma Leah McCorvey, aka ""Jane Roe"" CASE: Roe v. Wade (1973) HER STORY: McCorvey was 21, unmarried and on her third pregnancy when she, in the court's eyes, became Jane Roe. In a 1980 autobiography in which she revealed her identity, the young Texan described having a tough life up until then -- including having endured sexual, physical and emotional abuse, a failed marriage and problems with drugs and alcohol. She was still anonymous in 1973 when Associate Justice Harry Blackmum wrote the majority opinion that legalized a woman's right to an abortion in all 50 states. His reasoning was this falls under a woman's constitutionally granted right of privacy. Ironically, McCorvey didn't have an abortion. And she later switched sides in the heated debate and became a passionate anti-abortion activist. WHO: Edith Windsor . CASE: United States v. Windsor (2013) HER STORY: Edith Windsor met her soulmate, Thea Spyer, in New York's Greenwich Village. They reunited two years later, and soon thereafter Spyer proposed marriage with a round diamond pin. But actually following through seemed out of the question, given that lesbian couples could not legally marry then in the United States. The couple were together 42 years, marrying in 2007 in Toronto. Two years later, Windsor mourned Spyer's death and realized she faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes because Spyer was, in legal terms, little more than a friend. She sued, arguing that the Defense of Marriage Act that prevented the federal government from recognizing her marriage as valid was unconstitutional. On Wednesday, she won. It meant she's now owed back those inheritance taxes but, more significantly, that gay and lesbians around the country can now get ""the same federal benefits, protections and dignity as everyone else."" ""If I had to survive Thea, what a glorious way to do it,"" she told reporters. ""And she would be so pleased.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- On his knees, Nawroz prays. He is a condemned man about to die in a brutal way. His crime: The killing of his lover's husband. The judge: A local warlord in Kand, Afghanistan. The executioner: The victim's father. A mobile phone video captured the grisly scene. Many have gathered to watch this act, sitting on dusty earth, in dappled shade. Nawroz, wrapped in a white shawl, gets up from his prayer mat. His alleged victim's father is led by another man to Nawroz. ""Hold the gun right,"" the man tells the father. Bang. Nawroz falls to the ground. Two more shots ring out. The warlord ordered the man to pull the trigger twice, but he kept on, unable to deliver a swift fatal shot. ""Stop shooting, you donkey,"" the spectators say. ""He's still alive,"" says one. But not for long. This is not a video taken before 2001, in the days when the Taliban ruled and Kabul's stadium was reserved not for soccer, but public executions. It's from last month. After a decade of the U.S.-led war to defeat extremism in Afghanistan, feudal justice still exists. In remote Kand, outside the reach of NATO or the Afghan government, warlord Mullah Mustafa and his men rule by the gun. Mustafa helps keep the Taliban at bay, the people say, so the government lets him run his own fiefdom. It's not the sort of compromise the United States imagined a decade ago, bringing a type of justice that's swift and brutal. Human Rights Watch has said that in large parts of Afghanistan, no formal judicial system is in place and only tribal and other customary forms of justice are practiced. And a scathing report issued last year by the International Crisis Group described Afghanistan's judicial system as being ""in a catastrophic state of disrepair. ""A growing majority of Afghans have been forced to accept the rough justice of Taliban and criminal power brokers in areas of the country that lie beyond government control."" The report went on to say that the United States has not paid the same attention to justice reform as it has to other aspects of nation building. ""Its investment in judicial institutions is modest, as opposed to the billions invested in standing up the Afghan army and police,"" the report said. The U.S. Agency for International Development allocated only 1% of its Afghanistan budget between 2002 and 2007 -- $64 million -- to supporting the establishment of rule of law, the report said. Human rights monitors have pressed President Hamid Karzai's government to prioritize the establishment of a professional judiciary. But Nawroz's execution is more evidence that Afghanistan has a long way to go. There have been other cases that have sparked outrage. In 2006, Abdul Rahman was arrested and threatened with death for converting to Christianity. Last year, the Taliban ordered the first public executions by stoning since their fall from power -- a young couple who had eloped died in horrific fashion. Jalaludin, who witnessed Nawroz's execution, said Mustafa gathered local mullahs to reach a verdict according to sharia, or Islamic law. ""The mullahs asked the father to forgive Nawroz and to take some of his family's land and women in compensation,"" he said. ""But the father refused, so the mullahs ordered an execution."" Nawroz tried to buy his release, but Mustafa refused, Jalaludin said. He's not one to take bribes. After the killing, Nawroz first said he had been helped by his cousins, according to Abdul Gafor, one of Nawroz's cousins. ""For that reason, we were interrogated and beaten a lot during the questioning,"" Gafor said. But later, when questioned by Mustafa, Nawroz changed his story and said he had killed alone, Gafor said. Another cousin, Sikander, wished for law and order. ""We'd like strong government,"" he said. ""There's no police or government presence here, and Mullah Mustafa has government contacts."" Nawroz was a man whose jealousy allegedly led him to kill the man married to his lover. It's a story that has played out countless times in countless places. But here, in Kand, there was no trial, no jury of peers. Nawroz's punishment was strictly an eye for an eye, meted out in frightful fashion. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Moni Basu reported from Atlanta.","A warlord condemned Nawroz to death after he allegedly killed his lover's husband .
The victim's father shot him multiple times .
The execution was captured on a cell phone video .
Without a strong court system, Afghans have had to accept tribal justice ."
"(CNN) -- Just hours after word began to spread about Ed Koch's death Friday morning it was already clear: The brash former New York mayor leaves behind a legacy that crosses generations and geography. It's obvious across the Web, as tweeters and bloggers remember Koch as much more than a politician. A ""master showman of City Hall,"" tweeted one. Other words included ""cultural icon,"" ""great boss,"" and even ""model of New York-iness."" The three-term mayor who served from 1978 to 1989 died Friday of congestive heart failure at age 88. During his prime, Koch wore his quotable comeback lines like badges of honor. @JenniferPrestion posted this one: ""I can explain it to you, but I cannot comprehend it for you."" Opinion: Koch a friend and force to the end . Koch used quips as weapons against political foes on issues like racial tensions, labor unions, crime, the city's dwindling population and AIDS. In the end, he was ""almost impossible to dislike,"" wrote John Avlon. ""In this, he reflected the city."" The @mayoredkoch Twitter account remained active, featuring touching retweets. ""So many memories of @mayoredkoch,"" wrote Evelyne Wade @ChezEvy. ""Sang NY NY for him at City Hall. New York City will surely miss this feisty mayor and mensch!"" Koch's personality fed his widespread popularity. ""Like his policies or not,"" Tweeted @EarlFando, ""the man knew how to entertain."" ""He was the first mayor to open for 'Saturday Night Live,'"" wrote blogger Howard Barbanel. ""He was Mr. New York long before the advent of Rudy Giuliani."" In 1978, Koch delivered a nice line about ulcers, as Salon.com recalled. ""I'm the sort of person who will never get ulcers,"" the quote went. ""Why? Because I say exactly what I think. I'm the sort of person who might give other people ulcers."" A younger generation may best remember Koch from his stint on TV's ""People's Court,"" where during the late 90s, Koch sat in judgment over the show's endless parade of small-claims plaintiffs and defendants. ""Ed Koch has left this world to preside over the Big People's Court in the sky,"" posted @RossParsons. The mayor flexed his dramatic chops with minor roles on TV's ""Spin City,"" and the 1996 film ""City Hall."" In fact tweeter Betsie Huban @BetsietheBroker called Koch, ""the most fun mayor NYC ever had."" High praise in these days of frowning, stone-faced lawmakers who just can't get along. ""My first job in politics was working for Mayor Koch on transit & environmental issues,"" wrote Wendy Thurm @hangingsliders. ""Great job. Great boss."" Often credited with reviving New York's ailing economy in the 1970s, one Tweeter said Koch was ""the (right) man at the (right) time."" But a lot of folks aren't talking about the man's policies or his political agenda. They're talking about the man himself. Like they knew him personally. Like he was the friendly neighbor down the block. Decades before the spread of the Internet and its instant feedback, Koch got his feedback in the streets, sometimes standing at subway stations and asking voters, ""How'm I doing?"" ""In the '80s I got the pleasure of meeting Ed Koch a few times."" wrote Laurie Lombardi @LL712. ""Once I asked him, 'How's it going mayor?' He replied, 'I'm trying, kid.'"" Symbol. That's a powerful word. And it's popping up a lot about Koch. The Alec Baldwin Foundation @ABFalecbaldwin wrote that Koch was ""as much a part of New York as Central Park, hot dog carts, the subway. A mayor of the people like few others."" Many Facebook and Twitter posters are talking about Koch's desire to have his tombstone inscribed with the final words of terrorism victim Daniel Pearl: ""My father is Jewish. My mother is Jewish. I am Jewish,"" which prompted Michelle Boorstein @mboorstein to tweet about ""crying in the car during morning commute over Ed Koch's gravestone, modeled after Danny Pearl's."" So how'd he do? The answer to his signature question seems overwhelming: Not too shabby, Mr. Mayor.","Ex-New York City Mayor Ed Koch, 88, died Friday, sparking waves of online tributes .

"(CNN) -- There was little to celebrate in Kabul this week as the United States marked the tenth anniversary of its invasion of Afghanistan. The war against the Taliban is already the longest in America's history and there are few signs that it will be ending any time soon. The Afghan capital has experienced a number of deadly, high-profile attacks this year. A supermarket, the airport, a hospital, a police station, the Defense Ministry, the supposedly impregnable Intercontinental Hotel, the British Council and the U.S. embassy have all been targeted. When even the CIA cannot secure its main operations base in the city, Afghans can be forgiven for concluding that the insurgency, whatever NATO might say, is in the ascendency. Last month's turban bomb assassination of the former Afghan President, Burhanuddin Rabbani, appeared to deal another serious blow to advocates of peace. Rabbani, revered by many as a father of the Mujahideen movement that ousted the Soviets in the 1980s, was also the Chairman of President Hamid Karzai's High Council for Peace, which has been trying for a year to foster dialogue with the Taliban -- a strategy that Karzai has now publicly abandoned. Special: Afghanistan Crossroads . The assassin posed as a peace envoy from Mullah Omar, but the Taliban leadership in Quetta announced he was nothing to do with them. Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, alleged that the Quetta-affiliated Haqqani Network were behind many of the Kabul attacks and that the Haqqanis were ""a veritable arm"" of the ISI, the Pakistan military's notorious Inter Service Intelligence wing, whom he accused of ""exporting"" violent extremism to Afghanistan through its proxy. The Islamabad government naturally rejected this old accusation; while in a rare interview with the BBC, Sirajuddin Haqqani himself denied any involvement in the killing of Rabbani. Speculation continues to swirl as to who was responsible for the murder. Not even the motive is entirely clear. But neither Rabbani's death nor any of the other attacks in Kabul this summer will alter the way this war will come to a close. History teaches us that all insurgencies end, eventually, with dialogue, negotiation and political compromise -- a lesson we British re-learned the hard way during the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland. Why should Afghanistan be any different? Even the Pentagon acknowledges that there can be no purely military solution to the impasse. Few Western leaders any longer doubt that the Taliban will return to political power in some form or other. The only remaining question is what form. Rabbani, it should be noted, was Afghanistan's most prominent Tajik, not a Pashtun like the vast majority of the Taliban. There are those within the Taliban who may be prepared to share power with the non-Pashtun minorities in the future -- but plenty of others who are probably not. Some analysts therefore think Rabbani's assassination was a cynical attempt to eliminate one of the few credible, ethnic opposition leaders ahead of the eventual, inevitable peace deal: a blow for future Pashtun hegemony rather than an assault on the peace process per se. The High Peace Council was, in a sense, irrelevant. Its bridge-building efforts since it was set up in September, 2010 have all failed, which is perhaps unsurprising given that the Taliban have consistently said they will never deal with Karzai, whom they regard as a weak Western stooge, in charge of an administration they consider irredeemably corrupt. This is not to say that the Taliban leadership is not interested in dialogue. It seems they are. It is just that they only want to speak to Washington, and they prefer to do this directly, not through the medium of Kabul, or anyone else. ""Only the Americans have the weight to make talks happen,"" explained Arsala Rahmani, a former Taliban government minister. ""It is they who are fighting the Taliban."" The insurgency's leaders are no fools. What they most want is the withdrawal of what they see as infidel troops from sacred Afghan soil and they may calculate that negotiation could be the fastest and least costly means of achieving that end. Why shouldn't they? After all, the U.S. also wants its troops out Afghanistan. In June, President Obama publicly reiterated that all American combat troops would be home by 2014. Dialogue has in fact already begun. At least two rounds of talks have taken place this year, in Qatar and Germany, between U.S. officials and Syed Tayyab Agha, one of Mullah Omar's closest lieutenants: almost certainly the first high level contact between the two sides since 2001. The talks, according to most reports, were exploratory rather than substantive -- talks about talks at best -- and even these were nearly torpedoed by the glare of unwanted media attention. But they represent an important start, and a useful platform to build upon. A common Western mistake in the past has been to view the Taliban as a monolithic organization, when in reality it is a revolutionary work in progress; and like all revolutions, it incorporates a wide spectrum of views, from hardliners to relative moderates. Our task in the West is to identify, reach out and engage the ""moderates,"" and to do all we can to ensure that they win their internal debate on the future of Afghanistan. The military approach has manifestly failed, even as it continues. Negotiating with the Taliban now represents our best and perhaps only hope of ending this war, and of shaping a better Afghan future. The issue of power-sharing is critical to this, because the Tajiks and other minorities will never now accept a government as heavily dominated by Pashtuns as the Taliban's was in the 1990s. If Rabbani's killers were Pashtun nationalists, they are offering a prescription for a resumption of the ethnic civil war that has been going on intermittently for over three decades in Afghanistan -- and that is an outcome to be avoided at almost any cost. This needs to be the main focus of U.S.-Taliban talks as they go forward. For now, everything else is a distraction. The opinions expressed are solely those of the authors.","Killing of former Afghan President, Burhanuddin Rabbani, dealt a blow to peace advocates .

"(CNN) -- ""Lincoln,"" director Steven Spielberg's film about the 16th president and his battle to end slavery, rounded up plenty of votes for the 85th Academy Awards, topping all films with 12 nominations, including best picture. Spielberg, one of the most successful directors in Hollywood history, doesn't need the honors -- he has six previous directing nominations, including wins for ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Schindler's List"" -- but the showing marks a return to dominance for the filmmaker. In the last decade, his films, including ""War Horse"" and ""Munich,"" have received little more than respect at the annual gathering. Along with the best picture and best director nominations, the film also earned nods for best actor (Daniel Day-Lewis), best supporting actress (Sally Field), best supporting actor (Tommy Lee Jones) and best adapted screenplay (Tony Kushner). Second in the nomination race was Ang Lee's ""Life of Pi,"" the story of a spiritually curious boy who survives a shipwreck and travels across the ocean, accompanied by a tiger named Richard Parker. ""Pi,"" based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel, earned 11 nominations, including best picture, best director and best adapted screenplay. ""Les Miserables"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" both received eight nominations, including for best picture. Other best picture nominees are ""Beasts of the Southern Wild,"" ""Amour,"" ""Argo,"" ""Django Unchained"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty.""

You really like me!"" fame, is up for her third award, though her first in a supporting category. She won for ""Norma Rae"" and ""Places in the Heart."" Triumphs of youth and age . There are also some young names on the list. Perhaps none is so youthful as Quvenzhane Wallis, the star of ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" ""Beasts,"" a magical-realist fable about a little girl and her father surviving the caprices of weather, emotion and civilization off the Louisiana coast, received four nominations: best picture, best director (Benh Zeitlin), best actress (Wallis) and best adapted screenplay. Wallis, the film's spark plug, was just 6 when filming started. Now 9, she still ranks as the youngest-ever nominee for best actress. ""Everyone who made 'Beasts' happen is so happy!"" Wallis said in a statement. ""Thank you to all you Oscar folks, from me, my mom and my dad. ... Beast it!"" The film was a favorite at Sundance and did well at the box office -- especially given its sometimes inscrutable narrative -- but few expected it to do so well at the Oscars. Wallis was considered too young by some -- ""Sorry, Quvenzhane Wallis, but Best Actress Oscar Nods Are for Big Kids,"" read a headline in The Atlantic -- and Zeitlin's directing competition included Quentin Tarantino (""Django Unchained""), Kathryn Bigelow (""Zero Dark Thirty""), Ben Affleck (""Argo"") and Tom Hooper (""Les Miserables""). But when the nominees were announced, Zeitlin, who's 30, was on the shortlist. Another surprising nominee was ""Amour,"" the Austrian film from director Michael Haneke. Haneke is well-known overseas -- his 2009 film ""The White Ribbon"" won the Palme d'Or at Cannes as well as a Golden Globe -- but if American audiences recognize him at all it's for ""Funny Games,"" a 2007 English-language remake of his brutal 1997 thriller. ""Amour,"" about a husband and wife coping with the effects of a stroke and aging, received five nominations, including nods for picture, director, actress, original screenplay and foreign-language film. ""Amour"" star Emmanuelle Riva, 85, is the oldest nominee for best actress in Oscar history. Other best actress nominees are Jessica Chastain (""Zero Dark Thirty""), Jennifer Lawrence (""Silver Linings Playbook"") and Naomi Watts (""The Impossible""). The nominees for best actor are Day-Lewis (""Lincoln""), Hugh Jackman (""Les Miserables""), Washington (""Flight""), Joaquin Phoenix (""The Master"") and Bradley Cooper (""Silver Linings Playbook""). More Oscar nominations, including best supporting actor, actress . Surprising snubs . The love shown ""Amour"" and ""Beasts"" meant that ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" ""Django Unchained,"" ""Les Miserables"" and ""Argo"" all fell short of expectations, particularly in the directing category. ""Zero Dark Thirty's"" Bigelow, ""Les Miserables' "" Hooper and ""Argo's"" Affleck were all nominated for Directors Guild of America Awards, usually a sure sign of an Oscar nomination, but all fell short with the academy. Bigelow's snub was particularly surprising, given that she and her film had dominated critics' lists during awards season. The film, about an obsessive CIA agent pursuing Osama bin Laden, may have been affected by controversy surrounding its torture scenes. Some detractors suggested the scenes implied that torture contributed to the success of the operation. The film is still raising hackles. After its nomination for best picture, the Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal advocacy organization, released a statement in protest. ""Instead of awards, 'Zero Dark Thirty' should be earning condemnation for falsely suggesting that torture played a role in the capture of Osama bin Laden,"" the group said. The lack of nominations for Affleck was also surprising. When ""Argo"" was released in October, it looked like it was going to be the actor-director's year. ""Before November, the nominees (for best picture) would have been 'Argo,' 'Argo,' 'Argo,' 'Argo,' 'Argo' and 'Argo,' "" wrote Grantland's Wesley Morris. Instead, though the film received seven nominations, Affleck was left off both the directing and acting lists. He was recognized for the adapted screenplay, and he co-produced the film with George Clooney and Grant Heslov, so he's on the best picture list -- but he'll have to wait for the other trophies. Tarantino remains a critical and popular favorite -- ""Django"" has grossed more than $100 million domestically in three weeks -- but he failed to impress the academy with his directing prowess. The movie, however, picked up best picture and best original screenplay nominations. (David O. Russell, who directed ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" earned the fifth slot in the directing category.) Tarantino is still better off than Wes Anderson, whose ""Moonrise Kingdom"" picked up just one nomination, for original screenplay. Voting rites . The overlooked directors and other creative types -- such as the people of ""Skyfall"" (five nominations, but none in major categories), ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"" (three nods) and ""The Master"" (three nominations, but no love for the film or writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson) -- can always blame the system. The academy's voting process became more difficult this year with the addition of online technology that proved more complex than Florida's infamous butterfly ballot. According to industry news sites, the system contained so many safeguards that academy members found it difficult to cast their ballots. Some voters were so frustrated they visited the academy headquarters in person on the last day of voting -- Friday, extended one day because of the issues -- to make sure their votes were recorded. ""Next year I'm signing up for a paper ballot,"" one academy voter told Deadline Hollywood's Pete Hammond. But the system did shine on one unexpected recipient: ""Ted's"" Seth MacFarlane, who's hosting the Oscar show and co-hosted Thursday's nomination announcement with Emma Stone. He got a nomination for co-writing one of the original song nominees, ""Everybody Needs a Best Friend."" ""I guess I'm going to the Oscars,"" he cracked. The rest of the nominees might want to take lessons from the nomination leader. After all, it's no surprise a movie about a politician knows how to count votes. The 85th Academy Awards are scheduled for February 24 on ABC. The show will air from the Dolby Theatre -- formerly known as the Kodak Theatre -- in Los Angeles.

"(CNN) -- The plan to embalm the body of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez may have hit a snag. Scientists in a preliminary assessment have determined that the process might be ""quite difficult,"" acting president Nicolas Maduro said Wednesday. Maduro said at the opening of the Book Fair of Venezuela that scientists argued that ""the decision should have been taken much earlier."" He didn't say why -- but added that Chavez will always remain in Venezuela's collective memory . ""More than your physical body, we have the commander in eternal memory, especially this generation who heard it, touched it, saw him,"" Maduro told the audience. ""We have to keep alive his image, his voice, his thinking."" Chavez died this month, at 58, after a battle with cancer. Maduro had initially said his body would be embalmed. The plan was to have Chavez's body displayed much like the remains of former revolutionary leaders Vladimir Lenin of Russia and China's Mao. Venezuelan elections are scheduled for April 14 , about six weeks after Chavez died earlier this month. Maduro filed papers Monday to officially register to run for president. Photos: The displayed bodies of world leaders . During the televised event, Maduro and his supporters from United Socialist Party of Venezuela sang along with a recording of Chavez belting out Venezuela's national anthem. ""I am not Chavez, but I am his son,"" Maduro said. ""And all together, the people, we are Chavez."" Despite Maduro being from Chavez's political party, there will be a strong challenger for Venezuela's top spot. Opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski said he was ready for a fight. Capriles, 40, ran against Chavez last year and lost. But he mounted one of the fiercest challenges during the late president's 14 years in power. ""My fight is not to be president. My fight is for Venezuela to move forward,"" Capriles said Sunday night. On Monday, he also filed paperwork to run for the presidency.","Chavez died this month after a battle with cancer .

"(CNN) -- Friendship is not defined by the length of time two people share together. One defining moment is all it takes for two individuals to call each other friends. Cory Monteith's life, short as it was, taught me that lesson. His death, sudden as it was, taught me that lesson. Coroner: Mix of heroin and alcohol killed 'Glee' star . The defining moment of our friendship happened the third time I joined the cast of ""Glee"" for yet another memorable shooting experience as Sunshine Corazon. At the set, Cory was cool. Like his character Finn Hudson, Cory was so cool that everything seemed alright with him. I remember the last time I shot for ""Glee,"" it was May 9, 2011. It was a long shooting day that swelled into the wee hours of the following morning. I was a tad emotional when the clock struck 12 midnight -- not because I was tired -- but because May 10 was my birthday. And I, a girl from the barrio of Gulod in the far-flung Philippines, was alone in America. My family was not there, my friends were not there, I didn't have my loved ones there to celebrate my birthday. It didn't help that we all still had a long way to go on that day at the set of ""Glee."" How will 'Glee' handle the death of Cory Monteith? But Cory came to the rescue, just in time, with his sweet greeting: ""Happy birthday, Charice!"" A big smile crossed his handsome face. There was sincerity in his tone as he gave me a tight hug. He became family to me at that moment. In the remaining hours of our shoot, Cory told me he had Googled me and found my date of my birth. Cool Cory's act of kindness. He told other members of the ""Glee"" cast that it was my birthday and I was floored at how many of them greeted me with their warm birthday wishes. My body felt cold when I learned about his death. Too soon, too early, too young. I never thanked Cory enough for that one moment in time when he made me feel like family. I never thanked him enough for making me happy on that lonely day. Cory has many fans in the Philippines. In my silence, I mourn with so many of them. Addiction: The disease that lies . Finn was big in my country because ""Glee"" was big among the many young people in the Philippines. The Filipino people love him because we are a musically-inclined nation and we know how to appreciate real talent. We know how to love real talent. Many of my Filipino friends ask me what will happen to ""Glee"" now that Finn is gone. I have no answer to their query. But I lovingly ask them to pray for him -- for his peaceful passing. I am confident he's singing with the angels now. I am more than confident that his suave style, his cool attitude about everything will endear him more to his new-found winged friends in the afterlife. To his fans around the world who mourn his passing, I am with you. I know how it feels. Let's hold each other's hand. Let's remember Cory and continue to celebrate his music, his craft, his life. He will forever be in our hearts. I wish I could also embrace Cory's loved ones -- his family and friends, his girlfriend Lea Michele. I will pray for all of you, too. Thank you, Mr. Cool. My grateful heart will always miss you -- especially so on my birthday. Thank you. CNN iReport: Remembering Glee's Cory Monteith .

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, as the first bombs began to fall on Afghanistan, I was almost 500 miles away with our live satellite transmission dish on the roof of the Marriott hotel in Islamabad, Pakistan. Two weeks earlier the Taliban had forced me out of the country, but before they did I managed to get to their spiritual capital Kandahar, and to our make-shift office in a dusty, drab one-storey villa. That visit was now proving vital. My cameraman, Alfredo Delara and I set up our staff there -- two Afghan brothers -- with a camera and satellite phone. Their job was to be CNN's eyes and ears once we were forced out of the country. At that time, no other TV network had a presence in Kandahar. So as the United States began its response to the 9/11 attacks on October 7, our staff were able to relay details of the bombs falling around the airport. Later we would learn the target was the al Qaeda training camps where Osama bin Laden's fighters had infamously been recorded swinging on monkey bars and crawling through mock tunnels. That night it was enough to know the United States had gone to war. Special: Afghanistan Crossroads . Everyone knew it was going to happen, we even had a good idea when, but those two brothers kept me fed with an up-to-the-minute, blow-by-blow account, all those miles away on the roof of the Marriott. That information was then quickly passed to our audience. Although they dared not call in their reports live, they bravely continued day after day, week after week, venturing out with a camera to record what they could of the opening days of the war. And sometimes braving local anger when occasionally civilians were killed. When a Taliban armored personnel carrier was hit by a missile right outside our office, blowing out the windows, the two brothers were forced to flee, setting up camp in a tumbledown old house that two wars earlier had been their family home, graceful and opulent with rose gardens. They built a bunker among the flowers in the back garden, and kept us informed as best they could. When several months later the Taliban capitulated and Kandahar, their last hold-out, fell, the brothers took us to the airport. The showed us dozens of Arab passports found in the al Qaeda camp. Many had arrived just days before 9/11. Bin Laden knew what would follow and had rallied his supporters to his side. Taliban key to peace process 10 years on . Driving him from Afghanistan proved easy. Killing him, however, was a decade-long challenge. Ensuring the country does not fall into his allies' clutches and become once again a breeding ground for terrorism is proving far more difficult. The Taliban, once al Qaeda's erstwhile ally, regrouped and re-emerged. Their Pashtun nationalist agenda that claims to push the interests of Afghanistan's largest ethnic group, has, on the face of it, little in common with al Qaeda's global terrorism. The two groups share conservative Islamic values, but while the Pashtun tribes who make up the Taliban traditionally follow a more spiritual path of Sufi'ism, al Qaeda's takes the ultra-radical Salafist agenda. In theory, they are not natural bedfellows. But against a backdrop of a common enemy, the United States -- considered occupiers by the Taliban and the sworn global enemies for al Qaeda -- the two are drawn together. That's the conundrum: To separate and isolate al Qaeda from internal Afghan issues, thus denying them legitimacy in the Afghan conflict. The Taliban ride the great Mujahedeen myth that no occupier has ever successfully conquered their country. On the back of this, they refuse to give ground, whatever the pain. Al Qaeda money fuels the fight, and nothing in the past 10 years of war has divided the two. The Taliban win local recruits every time NATO inadvertently kills civilians. Al Qaeda feeds on these mistakes, selling them as a global Christian crusade against Muslims. Until recently the Taliban demanded NATO troops leave before they enter serious talks with the Afghan government. The United States and the Afghan government have demanded the Taliban publicly cut ties with al Qaeda first, ensuring the global terrorists can never return. But 10 years of war have not turned the tide. I've watched year after year. As long ago as 2002, I was embedded with U.S. troops in the mountain valleys near Khowst in Eastern Afghanistan, when they were handing out radio sets to Afghans. It was an inducement for them to hand over information about Taliban leaders in the Haqqani network. The same men are still being hunted today. It didn't work then, and it doesn't work today. Loyalty cannot be bought, and is rented only rarely and unreliably. The equation is simple: No one will rat out a well-armed neighbor unless they're sure of protection 24/7. In Afghanistan no one gets that, except President Karzai. And on the subject of Karzai, his last election victory was marred by allegations of vast fraud that even he has not been able to lay to rest. Efforts to build a nation around his flawed veneer are failing. NATO plans to use its troops to provide security until Afghan forces are deemed ready. But as every Afghan farmer who may or may not have an inkling of Taliban activity knows, if you can't trust the president, how can you trust the forces who might come in his name to protect you? The Taliban see this and exploit it. The cycle of violence that leads to occasional civilian causalities continues. Writ large, it means for all the well-meaning NATO effort, it is struggling to find a tipping point to bring the Taliban to their knees and sever the al Qaeda connection once and for all. Agendas have been set for NATO troops to leave over the next three years. Afghans fear the resumption of the civil war already under way as 9/11 was sprung on the world. The Taliban had all but a tiny sliver of land in the far northeast controlled by ethnic Tajiks. It was there that U.S. special forces first entered the country. Little surprise that those same northerners have benefited well from their early alliance. Today they are well armed and well equipped. A new civil war would be a highly-energized affair. Those Afghans who fret over NATO's departure are right to be disturbed. I share their concerns. The country has become a far more dangerous place. In the past decade a new highway from the capital Kabul to Kandahar seemed to symbolize a brave new future for Afghanistan. It slashed the drive from 16 hours to four. I drove it a few times before the Taliban shut it down. It was the same highway that Alfredo, my cameraman, and I drove just after 9/11. We'd bumped and bounced over its entire 300 mile sand and rock surface to reach our Kandahar office, train the two brothers, hand them the camera and phone before being forced out of the country. When I look back it saddens me immensely. So many lives have been lost. Both of the Kandahar brothers are dead. One brother was murdered a few years ago. He was killed by a bomb placed outside his grocery store in Pakistan where he'd fled Afghanistan's violence for the safety of his family. The other brother, I was told, had been killed in a roadside blast in his hometown, Girishk, in Helmand province. Even now all this time later when both of them are dead we cannot reveal their names for fear of endangering their families. It breaks my heart. They were amiable, educated young men -- the seed of the country's future, forever lost to the violence that still wracks their nation, winnowing out a generation of its promising sons.","Nic Robertson and his crew were forced to leave Afghanistan by the Taliban .

"(CNN) -- American intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has more damaging information that could be a ""nightmare"" for the U.S. government, a journalist who first published his documents said. Glenn Greenwald of the Guardian told an Argentine newspaper, La Nacion, that releasing more information to hurt the United States is not Snowden's goal. However, he said, Snowden has a ""large number"" of documents about software people use ""without consciously agreeing to surrender their rights to privacy."" Snowden has given copies of the papers to several people, Greenwald told the paper, according to an English translation. ""The U.S. government should be on their knees every day praying that nothing happens to Snowden, because if something happens, all information will be revealed and that would be their worst nightmare,"" he said. Others have suggested this before. Kristinn Hrafnsson, a WikiLeaks spokesman, said last month that other secrets may be revealed. ""There is more to come,"" he said. What are the odds of a Snowden getaway? Snowden is a former computer technician for U.S. defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton. In June, he gave Greenwald and colleague Ewen MacAskill a 12-minute video interview on why he provided the Guardian the classified documents about U.S. surveillance programs. Following his revelation, he fled to Hong Kong, then headed to Russia, where he is in political limbo in the transit area of a Moscow airport. He has requested asylum from Russia while he awaits safe passage to Latin America, according to WikiLeaks. No application from Snowden has yet been received, the head of the Russian Federal Migration Service, Konstantin Romodanovsky, told the nation's news agency, Interfax. The presidents of Venezuela and Bolivia have said their countries would give him asylum, and Nicaragua's president said he would offer it ""if circumstances permit."" Snowden faces espionage charges in the United States. He met with human rights activists and lawyers Friday at the airport. It was his first public appearance since he left Hong Kong on June 23. Merkel wants EU data protection pact . ""I announce today my formal acceptance of all offers of support or asylum I have been extended and all others that may be offered in the future,"" he said in a statement. ""As we have seen, however, some governments in Western European and North American states have demonstrated a willingness to act outside the law, and this behavior persists today. This unlawful threat makes it impossible for me to travel to Latin America and enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights."" In his remarks, Snowden also sought to defend his actions in leaking documents to the media that exposed U.S. mass surveillance programs. ""I did what I believed right and began a campaign to correct this wrongdoing. I did not seek to enrich myself. I did not seek to sell US secrets. I did not partner with any foreign government to guarantee my safety. Instead, I took what I knew to the public, so what affects all of us can be discussed by all of us in the light of day, and I asked the world for justice,"" he said. ""That moral decision to tell the public about spying that affects all of us has been costly, but it was the right thing to do and I have no regrets.""

"(EW.com) -- Like many a pop culture aficionado, ""The Canyons"" star James Deen read the New York Times story on Lindsay Lohan/ ""The Canyons"" over the weekend. But unlike many fans gobbling up the article for intel on Lohan, her co-star Deen read the feature, which outlined Lohan's love of chaos and inappropriate on-set behavior, with bemused wonder. ""The best way I can describe [the Times article] is actual life events reflected in a mirror and then retold for dramatic effect,"" Deen said on the phone with EW this morning. ""It's accurate enough that it can't be said that it's not; it's not a lie. But it's twisted enough that if you were actually there you're like, 'Wait. That's not exactly what happened.'"" What did actually happen was Deen (real name Bryan Matthew Sevilla), affectionately known as 'the porn star next door' with over 4,000 credits to his name, started hearing his name thrown around by screenwriter Bret Easton Ellis on Twitter. Ellis was looking for an actor for an upcoming noir thriller, and needed the person to be comfortable with a lot of nudity. Enter Deen. What Deen didn't know at the time was the low-budget project that would become ""The Canyons,"" directed by Paul Schrader, would also be starring Lindsay Lohan â€” and that equaled a lot of extra drama. Deen wasn't all that familiar with Lohan. He'd heard the stories about her self-destruction with drugs and alcohol, but he'd never actually seen a Lohan movie -- not even Mean Girls. So when Lohan appeared for her first day on set with him -- late, as The Times wrote, Deen didn't know what to expect. There is audio floating around of the two of them arguing over a scene one day, with Deen saying he was doing ""The Canyons"" ""for fun,"" which seemed to anger Lohan -- a convo Deen chalks up to a misunderstanding. ""It's just the delicate ego of the Hollywood person,"" he said. ""I've learned that most people in the Hollywood mainstream world are so delicate, fragile and egotistical. [Comments like mine] really f*** with their heads."" Lindsay Lohan tweets trenchant Golden Globes analysis . One day on set that Deen is eager to talk about is the duo's already-infamous sex scene, which would mark Lohan's first on-camera nudity for a film. ""The Times said there were a bunch of other porn stars there, but that's not right,"" he said. ""It wasn't like we were all having sex and an orgy in the bedroom! During rehearsal, everyone was talking the scene to death. Schrader was so uncomfortable. I think the issue was every other [cast member] was so comfortable, it made Lindsay feel like she didn't matter. ...I think Lindsay wanted [the nudity] to be a bigger deal than it was. She needs attention. [She wanted the crew to be naked] and they just laughed. So Schrader is freaking out and then this is what actually happened: Schrader looked her in the eye and said, 'I'm not making my f***ing crew do that. But you know what?' strips his clothes off except for his socks, walks to the monitor, and says, 'Action.' And Lindsay ran out from the closet, giggling like crazy, and we shot the scene. One take."" 7 biggest non-Lindsay Lohan takeaways from the NY Times story . Beyond the occasional flare-up, Deen said that he got along well with Lohan, hanging out with her to build chemistry, and that for a bit after the shoot [it concluded end of July] they would continue to text. While they have different ""lifestyles,"" ""She herself doesn't bother me at all,"" Deen said. ""It'll be interesting [to see how the movie turns out]. It might be really good; it might be really strange. But either way, it's going to be cool to watch."" As for what his own future holds post-""Canyons,"" Deen isn't concerned about getting past the porn-star label (nor does he have any plans to stop making adult films and transition entirely to more mainstream fare). ""Hollywood is always going to see me as 'that porn guy,'"" he said. ""There is no way to avoid it...I do adult because it's what I love."" But he is working on other projects in addition to shooting his scenes, most notably producing. He's taken to Kickstarter to get funding for a sci-fi western steampunk short called ""Cowboys & Engines."" ""I'm not going to be the next Brad Pitt or Marlon Brando. I'm that porn guy. And after [""The Canyons""] comes out, I'm still going to be that porn guy. And maybe I'll be that porn guy who gets offered a little indie every now and then."" See original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- The Taliban have been forced out of power, Osama bin Laden is dead, and al Qaeda, by many accounts, is not nearly as powerful as it once was. But 10 years after the start of the war in Afghanistan, many issues still plague the country. Insurgent violence remains a major problem, as the Taliban have regrouped in recent years. Questions also persist about the long-term viability of the Afghan government led by President Hamid Karzai. U.S. President Barack Obama has said that combat operations in Afghanistan will end by 2014, but the country's future is still very much in the air. Where will Afghanistan be 10 years from now? CNN.com asked five people -- either Afghans or Afghanistan experts -- to explain what they think is the most important thing needed for a successful Afghanistan. Here's what they had to say. Menon: Disperse power to the provinces . Rajan Menon is a professor and the chairman of the international relations department at Lehigh University. He recently wrote ""The End of Alliances,"" which examines U.S. foreign policy. After a decade fighting the Taliban, the United States still faces a resilient insurgency, one that will neither surrender nor pursue serious negotiations. But the Taliban's tenacity is not the main problem; it's that Afghans overwhelmingly (and rightly) regard President Hamid Karzai's regime as irredeemably inept and corrupt. Battlefield successes against the Taliban won't matter unless an Afghan government emerges with the capacity and legitimacy to govern. The United States can scarcely remake the Afghan government. But it can goad Karzai to disperse power to the provinces. If locally elected politicians with grass-roots support replace central-government appointees, the Taliban will find it harder to operate. Simultaneously, the U.S. should accelerate the training of Afghan security forces. It should be doing its utmost to help Afghanistan build the most effective military and police force possible. This is the most feasible strategy given the enormity of the problem and paucity of time. Anything more ambitious is wishful thinking. Calls to get tough with Pakistan are commonplace. But squeezing Pakistan would generate a backlash in a country already rife with anti-Americanism. Besides, it wouldn't work. Nayib: We must unite as a nation . Naweed Ahmad Nayib is an Afghan iReporter living and working in Kabul. He is also studying at the American University of Afghanistan, majoring in political science and public administration. The most important thing Afghanistan must do is prioritize the idea of one nation -- a nation without tribal, ethnic or other differences. Until we are united under one identity, we won't be successful in the future. In order to have a legitimate government with the participation of large segments of the population, the government has to unite the people. The government also has to work with the nation's interests at heart and not their own. The importance of governance at the local and regional level is very important; therefore it is vital that power is shared among all groups equally. And high-level government positions should be appointed on merit, not corrupt political deals or non-transparent criteria. The system must also work to exclude the involvement of warlords in the system. None of them has knowledge or the experience to be a part of this system, but most of them are actually running it now. In the long run, Afghanistan has to transform from a centralized model of governance to a decentralized one. That way, every province can come up with creative ideas and further build the bond between the communities and the government. Mosadiq: Defend basic human rights . Horia Mosadiq, Amnesty International's Afghanistan researcher, has more than 15 years of experience advocating for human rights, justice and gender issues in Afghanistan. In 2007, she brought victims of war crimes to testify before Karzai. She is also a survivor of human rights abuses in Afghanistan. Hopes were high in Afghanistan following the international intervention 10 years ago. But since then, human rights gains have been put at risk by corruption, mismanagement and attacks by insurgent groups who have shown systematic contempt for human rights and the laws of war. Today, many Afghans dare to hope for improvements in human rights in their country: to be able to go about their lives without fear of attack, to have access to basic services, education and work. For women, there is also the hope that they will have genuine and meaningful representation in policy and decision-making. For success, it's imperative that the Afghan government and its international supporters back these hopes with concrete action to defend them. There have been many international conferences on Afghanistan, much talk, and new benchmarks for success have been discussed and set many times. Yet a lack of success -- rather, many failures -- has not been acknowledged or properly remedied, either by the Afghan government or its international partners. An Amnesty International scorecard on the state of human rights in Afghanistan has found some progress in enacting human rights laws, reducing discrimination against women and increasing access to education and health care. However, progress on justice and policing, human security and displacement has faltered. Civilian deaths are increasing, and Afghans living in areas heavily affected by the insurgency have seen a serious deterioration in their living conditions. The Afghan government's international allies, including the U.S., have repeatedly said that they will not abandon the Afghan people. For success in Afghanistan, they must stand by this commitment and ensure that rights are not swept aside as the international community seeks an exit. Daiyar: Education, development can help fight extremism . Abbas Daiyar is an Afghan journalist on the editorial board of the Daily Outlook Afghanistan, Afghanistan's first independent English-language newspaper. His views can also be found on his blog, Kabul Perspective. Afghanistan is a war-ravaged country that has gone through three decades of crisis and chaos. For all those years, governance has been nonexistent. There has also been a lack of socioeconomic structures. So Afghanistan cannot become a model society overnight. Of course, peace and security are the utmost requirement to Afghanistan's future success, but there are other major factors to consider. We have not had a stable political system for the entire history of Afghanistan. We have never had a peaceful transition to power, just bloody coups and assassinations. During our entire history, the strongest rulers in Kabul have never had control over all parts of Afghanistan. We need a viable alternative, decentralized power and a continued movement toward a democratic system that assures long-term political stability in the country. Only a stable and democratic system can ensure good governance and socioeconomic development, which is the remedy for most of Afghanistan's problems. Religious fanaticism, a root cause of militant extremism, is a product of ignorance and illiteracy. It can be fought through education. Jones: Afghans must feel empowered . Kimberly Jones is a faculty associate at the Middle East Center for Peace, Culture and Development at Northeastern University. A successful Afghanistan requires a more pronounced shift away from the rhetoric and reality that is still underlying some policymaking. Instead of ""fixing"" or ""patching"" Afghanistan, there should be an increased focus on empowerment, particularly at the local and regional levels. Empowerment should center on creative strategies and tactics designed to transform the conflict: facilitating economic self-sufficiency, reducing corruption and creating sustainable local and national governance institutions. This is about the Afghans building something from the bottom up and being able to set and meet goals so their expectations for the future are realistic and aren't frustrated. This is about security -- theirs and ours. An empowerment approach must unfold with the understanding that Afghanistan is a complex country partly because of its diversity. With differences in ethnicity, religion, tribes and clans, careful planning will have to ensure that one particular group doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. It will also need to give due consideration to the influence of Afghanistan's neighbors, some of whom do not play well with one another and want to manipulate Afghan politics for their own ends. History has taught us that the Afghans cannot, and indeed should not, be controlled. Over time, empowerment places responsibility and accountability with the Afghan people for their own affairs -- where it should be.","It has been 10 years since the start of the war in Afghanistan .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's statement about the Egyptian military's seizure of power is as telling for what he doesn't say as for what he does: he doesn't mention the word ""coup."" He doesn't call upon the military to restore power to ""the democratically elected civilian government,"" but rather to ""a democratically elected civilian government."" In other words, it need not be deposed President Mohamed Morsy's. The thinking of the president and administration officials, according to a knowledgeable source, is that while the administration is not explicitly supporting the removal of Morsy from power -- it expressly did not support the move -- it is seeking to push the Egyptian military in a direction. If the Obama administration were to use the word ""coup,"" it would have legal ramifications that would result in the end of U.S. aid. If White House officials pulled the plug completely, they would be removing themselves from the picture altogether. The priority for the Obama administration is to preserve some space while trying to contain a fluid and combustible situation, the source said. The message being conveyed publicly and privately is that Obama accepts that this happened and even sees the potential that it could turn out for the best, given Morsy's autocratic rule. That said, the president is concerned that the military leaders and the acting leader might see the events as an opening to take on Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood through excessive force. Obama's words are intended to put the onus on the military to show restraint and to uphold its pledge to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, the source said. Notably, the president said he and his officials ""are deeply concerned by the decision of the Egyptian armed forces to remove President Morsy and suspend the Egyptian constitution"" without suggesting that there would necessarily be any negative repercussions. Potential repercussions are alluded to in Obama's statement, but never definitively threatened. The president said he had ""directed the relevant departments and agencies to review the implications under U.S. law for our assistance to the government of Egypt."" Would the president suspend the $1.5 billion in annual assistance given to the Egyptian government? He never says. The source says the message is that U.S. action can escalate from reviewing to cutting off if need be, but that the Obama administration is prepared to continue to work with Egyptian military officials if they take this in the right direction. Refraining from the arbitrary arrests of Muslim Brotherhood members and its supporters would be part of that ""right direction,"" the source said. For all intents and purposes, this means that as far as the Obama administration is concerned, Morsy is out of luck, and the ball is in the court of Army Chief Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi.","The Obama administration did not use the word ""coup""

"(CNN) -- In August, while 450 of Hollywood's A-list guests gathered at a lavish estate in California to celebrate Kim Kardashian's fairytale wedding, about 2 million people honored the special occasion in their own way: by watching ""Kim Kardashian, Superstar,"" the hardcore sex tape she made with musician Ray J. on the website of the adult video company Vivid Entertainment. Vivid is one of the most well-known companies in the porn industry -- its superhero parody flick ""Batman XXX"" was the best-selling adult movie of 2010, according to adult video news (AVN). ""When we started this business about 26 years ago, it was completely different than it is today,"" says Vivid founder and co-chairman Steven Hirsch. ""It was a very small business. The people in the business didn't really talk about it; they were sort of underground. Over time, it really started to change and I think we had a lot to do with that. We began to really court the media, go out there and talk about our movies and talk about our girls."" Vivid further distinguished itself from other companies by putting six-figure budgets behind its movies, not only to get talent and prominent adult film directors like Axel Braun and B. Skow, but for high production value, quality writing (yes, pornos have scripts!) and marketing. In the '80s, a billboard on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles promoted Vivid's stars and the company hired a publicist and created media kits, all of which had never been done in that industry before. ""These things that were so obvious in the mainstream world, we brought to adult,"" Hirsch says. ""We were able to get articles written in Time, Newsweek, U.S. News and World Report, where they were talking about the business of adult (films) and how much money there was in it. That turned the tide away from people thinking all of the girls are drug addicts and prostitutes and this is sort of the last stop."" Today, a top in-house Vivid production takes about six months from start to finish and can cost several hundred thousand dollars. Vivid also decided to follow the old Hollywood studio model of signing their female actresses, also known as Vivid Girls, to exclusive contracts. ""The theory being,"" Hirsch says, ""that if we were going to spend the money on promoting them, we didn't want the girls to make movies for other companies."" Jenna Jameson, now retired, is still widely regarded as the most famous and successful Vivid Girl. Currently, Vivid has only two contract girls, Allie Haze and Capri Anderson, the latter of whom is best known for being the woman who was with Charlie Sheen at New York's Plaza Hotel last October in one of the well publicized events that ultimately cost him his job on the TV show ""Two and a Half Men."" In addition to the skin-flicks that Vivid has produced over the last two decades, the company now has a very successful parody division that puts an X-rated spin on mainstream Hollywood blockbusters like ""Batman,"" ""Iron Man,"" ""Spider-Man,"" and ""Star Wars."" In addition to its own productions, Vivid is also known for buying celebrity sex tapes. More than 10 years ago Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee caused a stir when a sex tape from their honeymoon was leaked to the public. Vivid bought the Internet rights and that video remains Vivid's best-performing celebrity tape ever, according to Hirsch. ""Although at some point,"" Hirsch says, ""I expect the Kim tape to surpass that."" Since then, Vivid has purchased Paris Hilton's famous ""1 Night in Paris,"" and tapes featuring former ""Girl Next Door"" Kendra Wilkinson, actor Laurence Fishburne's daughter Montana Fishburne, former WWE wrestler Chyna, country singer Mindy McCready, ""American Idol"" finalist Jessica Sierra and reality show star Tila Tequila. ""With the Internet, people feel more comfortable with celebrities than ever before,"" Hirsch says. ""They follow them on Twitter and on Facebook, so it's just a natural progression that they'd be interested in seeing them in an adult movie where they're much different than we're used to. The fact is that if you look at the celebrity tapes that have come out, if you look at Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton, it's done nothing but help their careers."" Montana Fishburne cited Kardashian's meteoric rise as the inspiration for her foray into the adult industry. She told TMZ, ""I've watched how successful Kim Kardashian became and I think a lot of it was due to the release of her sex tape."" Kardashian sued Vivid when Vivid first made the sex tape public. The legal battle ended with a monetary settlement in which Kardashian would share in the profits, Hirsch said. Vivid puts a lot of resources into its celebrity division. ""It's so important to have unique content,"" Hirsch says, because ""the typical stuff"" can be watched free on the Internet. ""When it comes to celebrity tapes, there are very few of them,"" he says. ""Remember, there are a few thousand adult movies produced every year; there's maybe three celebrity tapes. ""There is not a single day that goes by that we don't get a phone call from some guy claiming to have some tape on some celebrity."" Ninety-nine percent of them, he says, ""are bogus."" What's his dream celebrity tape? Hirsch once answered that question by naming Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. Today he says, ""Kate and William wouldn't be too bad."" But let's get realistic. ""We're often surprised by some of the people we donÂ¹t think would do it and show a little passing interest,"" Hirsch says. ""But IÂ¹m not going to name any names. You'll just have to see.""","Vivid is a well-known and respected company in the porn industry .

"Washington (CNN) -- A prominent gay rights advocacy group says a key congressional Democrat will push for new rights for same-sex couples in the Senate's immigration reform bill -- a move which could undermine the legislation's bipartisan support. According to a spokesman for Immigration Equality, Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy intends to offer an amendment later this month allowing foreign-born individuals in committed same-sex relationships with Americans to apply for green cards. Currently, such rights apply to only to foreign-born men or women in heterosexual marriages with U.S. citizens. ""That's our expectation,"" said Steve Ralls, a spokesman for the group, which promotes equality in immigration laws for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender individuals. ""After the meetings we've had with Leahy and his staff, the message is pretty clear."" A spokeswoman for Leahy refused to confirm Ralls' assertion. The senator is an outspoken proponent of expanded rights for same-sex couples, and proposed similar legislation in the past. Under the plan, according to Ralls, gays and lesbians requesting green cards for foreign-born partners would have to be married if their states currently recognize same-sex marriages. If their states do not recognize same-sex marriage, they would have to meet a series of requirements proving major emotional and financial commitments. The list of requirements could include jointly owned property, shared child custody, joint bank accounts, joint credit cards, proof of a commitment ceremony and photographs of shared vacations and holidays with extended family, among other things. Leahy, head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, will likely propose the change at some point after his panel starts considering amendments on May 9, Ralls said. If Leahy moves forward with the amendment, it could destroy hopes for any significant GOP backing of the sweeping legislation. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, one of Republican architects of the 844-page bill, said Tuesday that adding such a provision would not be politically feasible in the ideologically polarized Congress. The bill ""was not intended to cover everybody in every situation,"" Rubio told conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt. ""This immigration bill is difficult enough as it is. ... If you inject something like this in the bill, it will die. The coalition behind it will fall apart."" Rubio, a potential presidential candidate and one of four Republicans in the Senate's so-called ""Gang of Eight"" that authored the bill, stressed that he would withdraw his own support. ""I hope we can avoid this,"" he said. ""This is not the issue to engage this in, or you will threaten the entire product."" It is significantly easier for Leahy to add the amendment to the bill while it is being considered by his panel. Democrats hold a 10-8 majority on the Judiciary Committee, and can approve changes on a strict majority basis. Controversial amendments taken up by the full Senate will almost certainly be required to garner a 60-vote supermajority. Members of the Democratic caucus only control 55 seats in the 100-member chamber. Backers of the bill have been hoping to win as many as 70 votes in the Senate, in order to give the bill major momentum heading into the more skeptical, GOP-controlled House.","Sen.

"Washington (CNN) -- A bipartisan group of senators announced an agreement on a student loans package Thursday that would cap rates, ending a standoff that lasted months and broke through a July 1 deadline for finding a solution. Under the compromise measure, undergraduate students would pay a rate of 3.85% next year on subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans. The plan would cap rates on loans to undergrads at 8.25%, for graduate students at 9.5% and parents at 10.5%. ""While this is not the agreement that any of us would have written, and many of us would like to have seen something quite different, I believe we have come a very long way on reaching common ground,"" Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the Democratic whip in the Senate, said at a press conference Thursday. Sen. Tom Harkin, the Democratic chairman of the committee that oversees federal education programs, also was present in announcing the deal. The Iowa senator had resisted for weeks agreeing to a plan unless it included caps on how high the interest rates on the loans could rise. Rude awakening for grads . Speaking after Thursday's news conference, Harkin said lawmakers may revisit the student loans issue when his committee wades into altering the Higher Education Act in the next several months. Even as Harkin praised the deal, he said he might reopen it as early as next year. ""Can we change it? Sure we can change it,"" Harkin told reporters. ""This is not the Ten Commandments written in stone for God's sake."" ""If we don't pass a Higher Education Act at least there is certainty in the future. If we pass a Higher Education Act, we might want to leave it the same we might want to change it a little bit. I don't know,"" he continued. Republicans praised the plan. Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma called it a ""win-win for both students and taxpayers."" ""Tying interest rates to the market allows students to take advantage of historically low rates while ensuring taxpayers will not have to foot the bill for arbitrary rates set by Congress,"" he said. Student loan rates doubled July 1 from 3.4% to 6.8% after Congress failed to reach a deal averting the increase. The agreement, if approved by the full Senate, would tie interest rates on a variety of government-backed loans to 10-year Treasury notes and would lock in surcharges paid to the government for administrative costs. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the upper chamber would vote on the deal ""as quickly as possible.""

"(CNN) -- Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, was honored Thursday at Washington National Cathedral in a memorial rife with mentions of heaven and earth. Hundreds of mourners, including Armstrong's family and fellow astronauts, packed the massive house of worship for a public ""celebration of (Armstrong's) life,"" three weeks after he died on August 25 at age 82. The cathedral's interim dean, the Rev. Dr. Francis H. Wade, called the ceremony an opportunity to ""give thanks for a life well-lived and service nobly rendered."" Neil Armstrong, a hero who shunned fame . Armstrong earned his renown commanding the Apollo 11 space mission and landing on the moon on July 20, 1969, when he was 38. ""Neil will always be remembered for taking humankind's first small step on a world beyond our own. But it was courage, grace, and humility he displayed throughout his life that lifted him above the stars,"" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said at the service, about an hour before he presented Armstrong's family with the American flag that flew over Johnson Space Center on the day the space pioneer died. Bolden didn't speak just on behalf of himself and NASA. The space agency chief also relayed portions of a letter President Obama wrote to the Armstrong family, which read, in part, ""Future generations will draw inspiration from his spirit of discovery, humble composure, and pioneering leadership, in setting a bold new course for space exploration. The imprint he left on the surface of the moon, and the story of human history, is matched only by the extraordinary mark he left on the hearts of all Americans."" Alternating between musical and prayer interludes, luminary after luminary described Armstrong as an extraordinary man who had performed extraordinary deeds, yet retained his humility and tried to diffuse the credit and fame he received among thousands of other NASA engineers, scientists, technicians and fellow astronauts. Retired Navy Capt. Eugene Cernan was the last man to walk on the moon, in December 1972, when he commanded the Apollo 17 mission. He paid homage to the founding member of his exclusive fraternity. ""He understood the immensity of what he had done. Yet Neil was always willing to give of himself,"" Cernan said, later adding, ""No one could have accepted the responsibility of his remarkable accomplishment with more dignity and more grace than Neil Armstrong. He embodied all that is good and all that is great about America."" Treasury Secretary John Snow, a friend of Armstrong's, called him ""the most reluctant of heroes."" ""With his uncommon humility and grace, Neil captured the very best of the American character and put it on display for the world to see,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Dear cicada friends, . We know you probably don't speak English, but we humans can't really buzz that well, so this letter will have to do. The last time we saw your cicada variety, known as Brood II, emerge was in 1996. Other broods have come and gone since then, but we're still glad to see you. You were still in your larval stage in '96, so you probably don't remember. Now, you're rising to the surface and having a grand ol' party. So much so that CNN is tracking readers' reports of your locations and listening to recordings of your buzz. We humans have a hard time imagining what it must be like to go into hiding for years on end and leave your fate in the hands of the world. Who knows what the world will be like when you next emerge 17 years from now? Will it be a mundane place or a strange post-apocalyptic scene? That's why we're so in awe of you. You are like living time capsules, and you take it in stride. Life is one big, buzzing party for you. Open Story: See where readers are finding cicadas . But all good things must come to an end, and before you go, we'd like to bring you up to speed on the things you've missed since you were last here. It's probably not pleasant to think about, but we want to reach you in time. We were inspired to write you this letter because of a heartfelt iReport we received from Janie Lambert of Hughesville, Maryland. She talked about many events that have happened in the past 17 years. Like your species, her family has hatched a new generation of offspring during this time. Your buggy brains aren't really geared for philosophy, but here's a grub of an idea: the tragedy of your lives is a metaphor for our own. It's too bad you barely missed Baz Luhrmann's ""Romeo + Juliet,"" with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the leading roles. It came out in fall 1996 -- well after you would have ducked into the ground. And don't forget about ""Tromeo and Juliet,"" which also came out around that time. Bet you would have related to William Shakespeare's infamous star-crossed lovers, who were destined to shack up and then die while still in their teens. We think you would also have a special appreciation for the ""Austin Powers"" movie trilogy, which kicked off in 1997. It features a British spy who is cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and then emerges in the 1990s with a strong mating instinct. Strip away the bad teeth and Union Jack decor, and your stories are much the same. Read about cicada life cycles and other broods . Culture shock was a big part of the ""Powers"" films, and you're probably feeling like a Rip Van Winkle as well. Surely you must be wondering where you can get some pogs, or the latest dramatic twists and turns in the Van Halen line-up. Radiohead released several acclaimed albums (including ""OK Computer"" and ""Kid A"") as well. Heck, there was even a Woodstock anniversary concert in 1999. A few years later, an electronic band called Cicada formed in the UK. Their self-titled debut album (2006) will make your feelers twitch. It includes a song called ""Cicadas"" that intermingles rhythmic buggy noises with sweet synthetic sounds. You skipped most of the boy/girl bands -- just barely. The Backstreet Boys put out their self-titled album in June 1996 and *NSYNC rose soon thereafter. The Spice Girls released their debut album ""Spice"" worldwide by 1997, and Britney Spears reached stardom status in the late 1990s. The Jonas Brothers, Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez ... there's so many. The brothers Hanson MMMBopped their way onto the charts in 1997 when they were just nymphs. They continued to put out albums after they finished molting, and now generate almost as much buzz as you do -- and have produced nearly as many larvae. Oh, and we almost forgot to mention ""Star Wars""! There are now three prequels to come before the first ""Star Wars"" (that was really Episode IV), and there's this character called Jar Jar Binks and ... never mind. You've had to digest so much already. If you're still unsure about what happened in the 1990s, BuzzFeed is totally on it. Any relation? They're about as cicada-like as humans get, constantly searching for whatever happens to be buzzing at any given time. The writers are in their laboratories concocting nostalgia for the 2000s as we speak. But we don't want to bug you with too much popular culture. There's also plenty of serious history that you've missed. We've been through five presidential elections now, and three presidents. The truth is, maybe you're better off not having seen footage of the September 11 terror attacks, or the wars that began afterward. You also conveniently missed the biggest burst of the housing bubble, or running the risk of getting laid off during the Great Recession. You can't bring most liquids through airport security anymore, and the NASA space shuttle program as we knew it has ended. In 1999, the technology world fretted over the Y2K bug, in which a date-formatting issue threatened to bring down computer programs everywhere. Concerns about serious problems seemed largely unfounded when 2000 finally rolled around. Cicadas should also be aware that the ""New Beetle"" was released by Volkswagen in 1998, which in turn renewed humans' desire to drive a bug. In the world of devices, the BlackBerry device is still consumed in its addictive CrackBerry form, but plenty of two-leggers are using smartphones and tablets with touchscreens. (You don't have hands, so you might need a keyboard that you can tap with your legs.) You fast-forwarded through the meteoric rise of the World Wide Web, and the spider-like reach of social media. You missed complaining about several Facebook layout iterations and being friends with that guy named Tom on MySpace in the 2000s. You can still be friends with him now, but it's just not the same. The predictable backlash toward spending too much time online works to your advantage, because you're well-equipped for it. You spend just about all your time in the out-of-doors, happily buzzing away and doing your thing until your time comes. Dying cicadas spotted in Staten Island . You're probably not worried about all these things that bipeds are always fussing about, but we just thought we'd let you know. Maybe there's a few things we're missing out on, as well. If there's any consolation, it's that other broods will return in the coming years, albeit in varying places and at different intervals. Brood III, Brood X, you name it. But there's only one Brood II. Until we meet again with your descendants 17 years from now, let's all say goodbye and farewell. Buzzing off, . The People of Planet Earth .

"(CNN) -- If you want to salute, race or flirt with other drivers in Nevada, you could soon be out of luck with some cars. That's because on Monday, Nevada became the first to approve a license for ""autonomous vehicles"" -- in other words, cars that cruise, twist and turn without the need for a driver -- on its roads. The license goes to Google, the Silicon Valley technology giant known more for its search engine and e-mail service that nonetheless has been known to dive into other big ideas such as space elevators to Internet-enabled glasses. In a 2010 post on Google's official blog, engineer and Google X founder Sebastian Thrun said that the self-driving vehicle project aims ""to help prevent traffic accidents, free up people's time and reduce carbon emissions by fundamentally changing car use."" He noted that the ""automated cars use video cameras, radio sensors and a laser range finder to 'see' other traffic, as well as detailed maps ... to navigate the road ahead."" There is no driver needed, though one is typically in the front seat ready to take control if need be. Earlier this spring, Google said it had ""safely completed over 200,000 miles of computer-led driving."" Monday marked a new milestone for the project, when Nevada issued a special license after demonstrations on state freeways, state highways, in Carson City neighborhoods and on Las Vegas' landmark Las Vegas Strip, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles said in a news release. The new plate is red and features the infinity symbol and the letters AU, for autonomous vehicle. All such cars on the road are ""test"" vehicles for now, though the state signaled it intends to be ""at the forefront of autonomous vehicle development."" ""I felt using the infinity symbol was the best way to represent the 'car of the future,' "" state DMV Director Bruce Breslow said. ""When there comes a time that vehicle manufactures market autonomous vehicles to the public, that infinity symbol will appear on a green license plate."" Google was the first company to apply to test its self-driving system in Nevada, the state said, while indicating that ""other auto manufacturers have indicated their desire to test and develop"" such technology in the state.","Nevada approves a license for ""autonomous vehicles"" that drive themselves .

"Washington (CNN) -- Inside the marble walls at the Supreme Court, the last days of June are called the ""flood season,"" a frantic push to finish its work for the summer. The stakes are especially high this term, with rulings on two major issues left to be announced. What the justices decide in the next week or so could fundamentally change lives and legacies on a range of politically explosive issues. On Monday, the court sidestepped a sweeping decision on the use of race-conscious school admission policies, ruling on the criteria at the University of Texas and whether they violate the equal protection rights of some white applicants. The justices threw the case back to the lower courts for further review. That leaves two high-profile issues with rulings still to be announced: . -- Same-sex marriage: A pair of appeals testing whether gays and lesbian couples have a fundamental constitutional right to wed. -- Voting rights: The future of the Voting Rights Act, and continued federal oversight of elections in states with a past history of discrimination. ""It's almost unimaginable the number of things that the Supreme Court is going to decide that will affect all Americans,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a top Washington attorney and publisher of SCOTUSblog.com. ""What would surprise me this term is if the court upheld ... the (enforcement tool behind the) Voting Rights Act. And I think it would be a big surprise if the court did anything radical when it came to same-sex marriage -- either saying there was a constitutional right to it, or rejecting that claim outright and forever. I think that's something they're going to try and tread that middle ground path."" The court will not say precisely when these hot-button opinions will be released, but it could wrap its work by Thursday. Depending on how long it takes the justices to finish up, that internal deadline might slide into early July. Veterans of forgotten voting war count the cost . Oral arguments have ended for the term, and the justices have already secretly voted on the pending cases. Individual justices have been assigned to write one or more opinions, as well as separate dissents. Only they and their law clerks know how this will end. And no one is talking -- continuing an unbroken tradition of discretion rare in leak-loving Washington. ""At the Supreme Court, those who know, don't talk. And those who talk, don't know,"" Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has said, echoing similar comments from her colleagues. The high court holds fast to an unofficial but self-imposed deadline to have all draft opinions finished by June 1. They are circulated to colleagues, and subsequent dissents and concurrences must be submitted by June 15. Nothing is final until the decision is released to the public. Votes can and do change at the last minute. Justices and their law clerks are holed up in chambers, working overtime to frame and craft the final opinions, making sure every fact, every footnote, every legal theory is fully checked and articulated. The nine members know they are writing their legacies with these issues. The outcome may be disputed, but the constitutional reasoning -- at least in the justices' own minds -- must be sound. ""Getting themselves organized, identifying the different majorities, getting opinions written and circulated in dissents and concurrencies will really test their capabilities in the final days,"" Goldstein said. The opinion-writing exercise is little-known, and the court likes it that way. Predicting the outcome is a time-honored Washington parlor game, but rarely consistently successful. There has been particularly intense focus on the same-sex marriage cases. Thousands of activists rallied at the court when the case was argued in March. Fast facts: Top U.S. Supreme Court decisions . At issue: . -- Federal benefits. The Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, is a 1996 law saying that, for federal purposes, marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman. That means federal tax, Social Security, pension, and bankruptcy benefits, family medical leave protections -- and a thousand more such provisions -- do not apply to gay and lesbian couples. Edie Windsor, an 84-year-old New York woman, is the key plaintiff in the DOMA fight. She was forced to pay more than $363,000 in extra estate taxes after the death of her longtime spouse, Thea Spyer. -- State referendums. The California high court had earlier concluded same-sex marriage is legal, but the 2008 voter-approved Proposition 8 abolished it. The U.S. Supreme Court is being asked to establish same-sex marriage as a constitutional right, but it could instead decide a more narrow question: whether a state, through referendum, can revoke that right once it has been recognized. The political, social, and legal stakes of this long-simmering debate will once again put the high court at the center of national attention, as it was in last summer's ruling upholding most of the massive health care reform law championed by President Barack Obama. Nine states now allow gays and lesbians to legally wed: Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia. Delaware, Rhode Island and Minnesota recently passed laws that take effect this summer. It is estimated about 120,000 legally married gay and lesbian couples live in the United States.

There is division within the ranks of both sides about whether the court will -- and should -- issue a sweeping ruling on the constitutional ""equal protection"" question. Some activists and politicians -- even some justices themselves -- think the elected branches may be in a better position to drive the same-sex marriage issue, not the courts. Voters in three states last November approved same-sex marriage, marking the first time the ballot was used to approve such unions. California is the only state to allow and then revoke same-sex marriage. ""This is a conservative court -- conservative ideologically and conservative in the sense that they like to take baby steps, and it seems very unlikely that they would make some big radical move requiring all states to recognize same-sex marriages,"" Goldstein said. ""They are much more likely to do something a little more modest. The other thing about them is that they don't want to be on the wrong side of history. It seems pretty clear where this is going, with a much broader recognition of same-sex marriage, and so the justices don't want to call that into question when the country is headed in that direction."" In fact, the court has set itself up to ""punt"" on both Proposition 8 and DOMA, avoiding for now consideration of the constitutional questions. Such a ""legal letdown"" could turn on ""standing,"" or the legal authority or eligibility of those involved in the lawsuit to argue the case. California's governor has refused to defend Proposition 8 in court, leaving a coalition of private groups to step in. Can they satisfy court scrutiny by establishing they would suffer tangible harm if the lower court ruling stands? The justices could also ""DIG"" it, that is, have the case ""dismissed as improvidently granted."" Basically, the justices would be saying they should not have taken the Proposition 8 appeal in the first place. Justice Sonia Sotomayor at the March oral argument suggested as much: ""If the issue is letting the states experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction, why is taking a case now the answer?"" Some of her conservative colleagues seemed to agree as well. The difference between rejecting the case on standing or DIG grounds would be important. A DIG would be likely to mean lower court rulings striking down Proposition 8 would hold, allowing California gay and lesbian couples to marry if they chose. How quickly that would happen is unclear because further legal challenges could be filed. But a ""standing"" ruling would likely nullify everything, perhaps forcing both sides to start all over again in the lower courts, and limiting the reach of gay marriage to perhaps only a few California counties. Another statewide referendum, likely to be held next year, could finally settle the matter. Recent polls show growing support for same-sex marriage in California, reflecting a trend nationwide. Scenarios, terminology key in prepping for same-sex court ruling . DOMA has its own sticky procedural questions. Obama now supports gay marriage, and has refused to defend the 1996 federal law. That has left House Republicans as the official parties in support of DOMA. So the court could also dismiss that case on standing grounds. Most legal analysts, however, expect a more substantive ruling, one based on DOMA's merits. Picking winners and losers at this stage is a subjective, even partisan, exercise. The court itself will be both cheered and vilified however it rules. But as an institution, it has survived similar crises of confidence over its discretionary authority in rulings involving slavery, racial integration, corporate power, abortion -- even Bush v. Gore. Reaction to these big cases will be swift and furious from the professional punditry and halls of government. Some individual Americans stand to gain from the decisions, while others could be hurt financially and emotionally. All of this is entrusted in the hands of nine judges. The Supreme Court usually gets the last word in these matters, regardless of who disagrees with the decisions. Justice Robert Jackson, on the court from 1941 to 1954, put it this way: ""We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final.""","Rulings on two major issues are among those remaining to be announced .
The cases include a pair of appeals testing the right to same-sex marriage .
Two other cases involve the future of the Voting Rights Act and oversight of some elections .

"Patna, India (CNN) -- A week after an Indian school served toxic food to students, leaving 23 dead, its headmistress remains missing along with her husband, police said Tuesday. A nine-member team of officers has been formed to investigate and track down the principal, Meena Kumari, police superintendent Sujeet Kumar said. Police presence is heavy in the village in Bihar state, especially around the principal's home. Authorities have recorded statements from 40 witnesses, including child survivors of the July 16 food poisoning, Kumar said. Residents went on a rampage a day after the toxic meals were served in the local government school, torching at least four police cars. In acts of protest, parents of at least three children have buried their kids near the school -- one right in front of the building, according to officials. Police will ensure the headmistress' safety when she resurfaces or is taken into custody for questioning, authorities said. Pesticides have been found in the food and oil used in the school lunch that sickened 25 others on July 16 in northern India's Bihar state, police said. Forensic scientists found monocrotophos, an organophosphorus compound used as an insecticide, ""in the samples of oil from the container, food remains on the platter and mixture of rice with vegetables in an aluminum utensil,"" Assistant Director General Ravinder Kumar told reporters in Patna. Monocrotophos, which is used for agricultural purposes, is toxic to humans. The cook, Manju Devi, was hospitalized after eating the food she prepared, doctors said. Devi told police that the headmistress did not heed her warning that the mustard oil used to prepare lunch looked and smelled bad. Instead, the headmistress insisted she continue preparing the meal, officials said. Confusion, grief and despair in India's school poisoning village . An investigation found compromised hygiene and sanitation in the school, which was running from a single-room makeshift building. Experts have said the deaths underscore the problem of food safety in the country, and have prompted discussion on how to improve national school food programs amid news that authorities had warned months ago of safety problems with the state's school meal program. Authorities in Bihar -- one of India's poorest states -- announced that a committee would be formed to improve food preparation in rural schools. The Bihar students, who were ages 5 to 12, started vomiting soon after their first bite of lunch; some fainted, authorities said. According to the Indian government, nearly half of India's children are malnourished. Since a Supreme Court decision in 2001, government schools in India have been required to provide free meals to students younger than 13.

"(CNN) -- It was a wonderful life. That's how Edith Windsor describes her partnership with Thea Clara Spyer. Theirs was not a fleeting romance -- the women were together 42 years sharing ups and downs, laughs and tears. They also shared what they'd earned together, including from Windsor's job as a programmer with IBM and Spyer's work as a psychologist. ""We were mildly affluent and extremely happy,"" Windsor said. ""We were like most couples."" But even after they married in 2007 in Toronto, some 40 years into their courtship, the two women were not ""like most couples"" in the eyes of the state of New York, where they lived, nor in the eyes of the U.S. government, which under the Defense of Marriage Act mandates that a spouse, as legally defined, must be a person of the opposite sex. This fact hit Windsor hard in 2009, while in a hospital after suffering a heart attack a month after Spyer's death. As she recovered and mourned, Windsor realized she faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes -- $363,053 more than was warranted, she later claimed in court -- because Spyer was, in legal terms, little more than a friend. ""It was incredible indignation,"" Windsor recalled feeling. ""Just the numbers were so cruel."" This anger gave way to action. Why, she and her lawyers argued, should her relationship with Spyer be any different when it came to rights, taxes and more than a heterosexual couple? Why should Windsor have to pay, literally, for losing her soulmate -- even though, by 2009, New York courts had recognized that ""foreign same-sex marriages"" should be recognized in the state as valid? In October, Windsor, now 83, got an answer in the form of a ruling opinion from the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That court found, in her favor, that the Defense of Marriage Act violates the Constitution's equal protection clause and thus she shouldn't have had to pay an inheritance tax after her partner's death. This follows a similar ruling, in May, from another federal appeals court in Boston. Federal appeals court strikes down Defense of Marriage Act . Neither opinion settles the matter for good. That is expected to happen next year when the Supreme Court will weigh the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act through the prism of Windsor and Spyer's story. It is one of two cases related to same-sex marriage that the high court will consider, it announced Friday. The other addresses California's Proposition 8. Even with those cases still to be decided, Windsor said earlier this fall -- when the lower court decided in her favor, three years after Spyer's death -- that she felt she could finally breathe and celebrate. It was a day she relished, and one she didn't entirely expect after all her heartache. ""What I'm feeling is elated,"" Windsor said. ""Did I ever think it could come to be, altogether? ... Not a chance in hell."" Instant chemistry in Greenwich Village . Born in Philadelphia in 1929, on the eve of the Great Depression, Windsor graduated from Temple University and earned a master's degree, in 1957, from New York University, according to a fall 2011 story in the latter school's alumni magazine. She had come to New York hoping for a fresh start after a brief marriage, according to the report. And professionally, she found it -- working for NYU's math department and soon entering data into its UNIVAC, one of a few dozen of the huge commercial computers then in operation. Her knack for programming eventually helped her land a job, and to excel, at IBM. But something was missing in her life, personally. Or, as Windsor put it more succinctly, ""I suddenly couldn't take it anymore."" In the documentary ""Edie and Thea: A Very Long Engagement,"" she recalled pleading with an old friend to take her ""where the lesbians go."" And so Windsor spent one Friday night at Portofino, a restaurant in New York's Greenwich Village. ""Somebody brought Thea over and introduced her. And we ended up dancing,"" she recalled. ""And we immediately just fit,"" added Spyer, on the documentary. Timeline: Same-sex marriage . After reuniting two years later, according to their New York Times' wedding announcement, their connection proved deep and lasting. In 1967, Spyer proposed marriage with a round diamond pin. A year later, they purchased a house together in Southampton, according to the NYU Alumni Magazine story. Yet while the gay rights' movement took off after the 1969 Stonewall Riots, which occurred while Windsor and Spyer were vacationing in Italy, an actual marriage -- a legal union -- seemed out of the question. Marriage, at last, and then heartache . Regardless, their love remained strong. On the documentary, filmed around 2007, Spyer said, ""Each one of us, in fact, looks different from how we looked when we met. But if I look at Edie now, she looks exactly the same to me. Exactly the same."" Windsor had halted her new career as a gay rights activist to help care for her partner, who suffered from multiple sclerosis. And it was after getting a ""bad prognosis (that) I had another year to live and that was it"" that Spyer proposed again. ""And I said yes,"" Windsor recalled. ""She said, 'So do I.' "" Video shows Spyer being pushed through the airport in her wheelchair. It was from that seat -- on May 22, 2007, at Toronto's Sheraton Gateway Hotel -- that she gave her vows to make their marriage official in Canada. ""I, Thea Spyer, choose you, Edith Windsor, to be my lawful, wedded spouse,"" she said. ""For richer and for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do us part."" Having happily gone four decades without, Windsor soon realized how much the marriage meant to her. It made her and Spyer's love legitimate and all the more real. ""It's different because somewhere you're a hidden person, and suddenly you're a citizen of the world,"" she said in October. But what happened as Spyer's condition worsened, and after her death, proved a stark reminder they were not legally united in their own country. And the fact that New York legalized same-sex marriage in 2011 didn't mean that Windsor, for example, would suddenly get back the hundreds of thousands of dollars in inheritance tax that she'd given to the government. That could happen, however, if the Supreme Court upholds the appeals court ruling. That is Windsor's hope, as is that whether a committed couple is heterosexual or homosexual becomes irrelevant within the next decade. In the meantime, Windsor said she's proud to fight for something bigger than herself and the legitimacy of her union with Spyer. She hopes, through her struggle, to help make it so gay teenagers can ""fall in love knowing there's a future,"" that children of gay couples won't feel the need to explain their families, and that homophobia becomes a thing of the past. ""I feel like I'm representing them.""","Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer met in New York and were together more than 40 years .

"(CNN) -- In more than eight Earth years, NASA's unexpectedly tough Mars rover Opportunity has been stuck in a sand dune, nursed a bad shoulder and endured five brutal winters on Mars. Its new rover, Curiosity, should be so lucky. Scientists at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California planned for Opportunity to last for 90 days on Mars after its landing in 2004. Instead, it's now run for more than 3,000 martian days and traversed 22 miles of the planet's surface -- scoured by sandstorms and working through temperatures that range from 86 degrees to 112 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (30 to -80 C). ""The rovers were designed to last in extreme conditions, and we've taken great care in how to operate them,"" said JPL roboticist Vandi Tompkins, one of Opportunity's former operators. ""Someday, some essential part will go that stops it. It's going to happen. But we try our best to push that as far as out as we can."" Even after all these years, ""You still see a lot of excitement"" at Opportunity's control center at JPL,"" Tompkins said. NASA spent $800 million to launch Opportunity and its sister rover, Spirit. The twin craft lifted off from Cape Canaveral in June 2003 aboard separate Delta II rockets and landed successfully the following January, bouncing onto the surface inside a cocoon of air bags. The roughly 5-foot-long, 380-pound rovers were loaded with a variety of cameras and instruments used to analyze martian rocks and soil, and their findings have helped convince NASA that Mars once had water on its surface. 'Crazy' Mars landing coming . NASA lost contact with Spirit in 2010 and wrote off the rover in May 2011, but Opportunity kept on going. Among its findings was a vein of the mineral gypsum -- an indication that water once ran across the surface of the Red Planet. And it beamed back its 100,000th picture, a sweeping panorama of the martian surface, in early July. Not that it's been unscathed. It's got a worn ""shoulder"" joint on its robotic arm, making some operations difficult. It was stuck in a sand dune for nearly two months in mid-2005. But it has had unexpected luck, as well. ""The solar panels were expected to collect a lot of dust, and they did,"" Tompkins said. ""But we've had winds that have cleaned the solar panels occasionally, and that has given it a new lease on life."" Tompkins is now working on the much-larger Curiosity. Designers built the 2,000-pound craft with lessons from Spirit and Opportunity in mind, including a longer, more advanced robot arm, a hammer drill that can crack apart rocks and a laser that reduces rock to a hot plasma, allowing an on-board spectrograph to determine its composition. Opportunity's neighborhood is known as the Meridiani Planum, a sandy desert located a few degrees south and west of the martian equator and its prime meridian. The site is nearly halfway around the planet from Spirit's location, and from where Curiosity is expected to touch down at 1:31 a.m. Monday ET. It can run more than 100 meters (325 feet) in a day, but it's not exactly a speed demon: Opportunity tops out at about 2 inches a second. But it's also capable of climbing up to 30-degree slopes. Building an out-of-this-world menu for Mars . Tompkins says the goal for operators is ""pushing the limits and keeping it safe."" ""The fact that the rovers have lasted also has to do with how carefully you operate them,"" she said. The average distance between the Earth and Mars is about 225 million miles, but it varies widely during the year as both planets orbit the sun. When they're the farthest apart -- about 400 million miles -- a radio signal from NASA takes more than half an hour to reach the rovers. That means controllers have to pre-program Opportunity's daily movements, working from a three-dimensional model of the surrounding terrain, Tompkins said. JPL transmits the plan to the rover, which carries out the program and beams the data back to Earth via two satellites now circling the Red Planet, the Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. That means the programs have to be completed by the time those satellites are in range, adding one more wrinkle to controllers' calculations. ""Imagine planning your drive from your home to your office,"" she said. ""Even though you know that route truly well and there's no traffic, imagine having to pre-think all those options. Then imagine it's raining."" Complete coverage on the Mars landing .","The Mars rover Opportunity has survived eight and a half years on Mars .

"(CNN) -- The wedding photo shows the happy couple poised to kiss, ready to begin an adventure that has now taken them to the U.S. Supreme Court. For Karane and Jamelle Thomas-Williams, this is a fight for recognition by the federal government of their legal same-sex union, part of a landmark constitutional appeal over same-sex marriage and ""equal protection."" Their love has united them, but the larger social issue has split the country for more than four decades. Rulings in that and a related appeal over state marriage laws are expected from the high court Wednesday. The Washington, D.C., couple were legally married last October -- but not in the eyes of some of their employers or elected leaders. Karane serves her community as a Metropolitan Police officer. Jamelle serves her country in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. But since she is a federal worker, the couple cannot share the 1,000-plus federal perks enjoyed by married heterosexuals -- joint tax returns, loan programs for veterans, and survivor, pension, bankruptcy, family medical leave and health insurance benefits. Under the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) passed in 1996, marriage is defined for federal purposes as between one man and one woman. That means the estimated 120,000 gay and lesbian couples legally married in nine states and the District of Columbia are still considered -- in the eyes of DOMA opponents -- the equivalent of girlfriend and boyfriend. CNNMoney.com: Big money at stake in same-sex marriage ruling . ""As a federal employee and as an airman, you get a constant reminder that you're second class,"" Jamelle told CNN. ""I had to list Karane as my sister just so that someone would call her in the event that I'm killed or missing in action, or I'm hurt on the job. She can't be my emergency contact, she can't receive my remains. As far as my death benefit, I had to list her as 'other.'"" Adding to the confusion is Karane's status as a D.C. government employee. She enjoys the benefits of her relationship with Jamelle because her local government in the nation's capital recognizes same-sex marriage. ""But once we step outside of D.C., it's a whole other ballgame,"" said Karane. In neighboring Virginia, which does not recognize their marriage, the couple says they are viewed as ""legal strangers."" The woman at the center of the case . What is federal government's role in defining marriage? The larger debate over DOMA's intent and impact 17 years after passage has driven a wedge between the executive and legislative branches. At issue is what role the federal government should play when it comes to marriage -- something states have traditionally controlled. Challenging DOMA: 5 things we learned . ""What the court is being asked to decide is whether or not Congress can pass a law that treats same-sex couples, who are already married under the laws of their state, different from opposite-sex couples,"" said Amy Howe, a leading appellate attorney and editor of SCOTUSblog.com. Four federal district courts and two appeals courts have already struck down the law's restrictive benefits provision. And in a rare move, the Obama administration also abandoned its defense of congressional authority, saying DOMA is unconstitutional. That has left House Republicans in the unconventional position of stepping in to argue it should stay in place, at least for now. Traditionally, the role of defending federal law would fall to the U.S. solicitor general's office. But President Barack Obama, in an election-year stunner, said last May he now supported same-sex marriage. The president had already ordered Attorney General Eric Holder not to defend DOMA. That raised the question of whether any party could rightfully step in and defend the law. Justices could put an end to hard choice for gay couples . Besides the constitutional issue, the justices had specifically ordered opposing sides to argue a supplemental question: whether congressional Republicans -- operating officially as the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the U.S. House of Representatives -- have ""standing"" or legal authority to make the case. ""Let's not confuse the issue of DOMA and the administration's decision that it was unconstitutional,"" House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told CNN. ""It is not their role to decide what's constitutional. DOMA was a law that was passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by President Clinton. In our system of government, the administration doesn't get to decide what's constitutional -- the Supreme Court does. And our financing the lawsuit was to make sure the proper forum was used to make sure that we know what's constitutional and what isn't."" Supporters of traditional marriage agree. ""DOMA's important because Congress said it's important,"" said Austin Nimocks, senior counsel at the legal ministry Alliance Defending Freedom. ""We sent our elected representatives to Washington, D.C., and they chose to say that marriage is one man and one woman for purposes of federal law."" And many conservatives argue the courts should stay out of the larger constitutional issues and let citizens and the legislatures hash it out. Some activists worry nine unelected justices will issue a sweeping 50-state mandate and redefine marriage as whatever personal bond they now think it is. Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, says nothing in the Constitution tells states whether and how they should ""evolve"" on such an established institution. She said liberty is fundamental right, but that government also has broad discretion to affirm the idea marriage is mainly about ensuring biological children are raised in a stable two-parent family with a mother and father. Same-sex marriage in the 21st century ""is clearly not what anyone understood as marriage at the time of the framing of the Constitution,"" she told CNN, saying that should be enough to keep the high court out of the current case. Gay couple fights for right to marry in epic high court case . Lack of protections, benefits if partner deploys . Jamelle and Karane said they hit it off immediately after they met by chance at a downtown club's Ladies Night, and felt like they had known each other forever. They were together four years before marrying last October. Karane said she went to Jamelle's mother first to ask her daughter's hand in wedlock. Sitting in their comfortable Washington home, they appear blissfully happy being together, but DOMA has put unexpected strains on the marriage because of ""little frustrations."" For one thing, they worry what could happen when Jamelle gets sent overseas in a war zone. ""Technically, I am a single person deploying,"" she said. ""So I don't have any protection for my family. I could deploy tomorrow and there would be nothing in place to help my family. It would be just me. So that's definitely scary. Financially, making sure that the responsibility that we have to each other and to our families is taken care of, and it would be like I'm leaving Karane in a lurch."" Karane added: ""It's like we have to still go above and beyond just to get to where heterosexual couples already are."" They believe they are burdened by a triple social stigma -- as women, black and lesbians. The couple hopes to have children someday, but that would create further layers of what they say are discriminatory rules. For now this self-described ""boring couple"" say they look forward to the day their children would be born and raised in a post-DOMA world. But regardless how the Supreme Court rules, they say they will persevere. ""I should be able to walk with my wife hand in hand and live our life. We shouldn't have to sit here on the edge of our seats, waiting for a decision,"" said Karane. ""Are we going to finally be able to just be recognized without any strings attached?... We're humans, we live in a strange society, and we have to work with what we've got."" Kevin has a family: A same-sex couple's remarkable journey .

"Athens (CNN) -- Greece's Parliament has voted that former Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou should face criminal prosecution for allegedly wiping the names of at least three relatives from a list of more than 2,000 Greeks with Swiss bank accounts. The list of those with accounts at a Geneva branch of HSBC is known as the ""Lagarde list,"" because it was given by Christine Lagarde, then France's finance minister, to her Greek counterpart in August 2010. However, its existence was not revealed until September 2012. Information that the list had been misplaced, copied and altered so as to exclude certain names then started coming to light, causing a major uproar. The three charges against Papaconstantinou are breach of trust, doctoring an official document and dereliction of duty. If convicted, he faces a prison sentence. Papaconstantinou served as finance minister from October 2009 to June 2011, and was finance minister when Greece negotiated its first international bailout. Because he is a lawmaker, Parliament has to approve the lifting of immunity before any prosecution can proceed. In a secret ballot late Monday, 220 deputies in the 300-seat Parliament voted in favor of the former minister being prosecuted for at least one charge, and 166 for all three. Seventeen deputies were absent. Addressing lawmakers before the vote, Papaconstantinou denied wrongdoing and said he was being targeted ""for one simple reason, being the finance minister who put the country in the bailout process."" A council of judges will convene, probably later this week, to decide whether Papaconstantinou should face the criminal charges outlined in Parliament. While it is not illegal to hold a Swiss bank account, and there is no evidence that anyone broke the law, suspicions are high in Greece that some of those named in the list may have opened the accounts to avoid paying taxes to the Greek state. A parliamentary committee was set up last year to look into why no investigation was carried out under either Papaconstantinou or his successor as finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos. Greek media questioned whether the failure to investigate those named for possible tax evasion might have been the result of an attempt by politicians to protect a wealthy elite. Lagarde is now the International Monetary Fund chief. Journalist Elinda Labropoulou reported in Athens and CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Greek Parliament votes for ex-minister to face charges over alleged tampering .

"London (CNN) -- A bill to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales passed the British House of Commons on Tuesday, clearing the way for it to go before Queen Elizabeth II for royal approval before the end of the week. With the queen's approval -- a formality in the UK -- the first same-sex wedding could be held as early as next summer. The Marriage Bill, as it was known, had the support of Prime Minister David Cameron, but his commitment has put him at odds with many in his Conservative Party and its grass-roots supporters. The Conservatives govern in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. ""The title of this bill might be marriage but its fabric is about freedom and respect,"" Culture Secretary Maria Miller said shortly after the bill's passage. She said the passage of the bill was ""clear affirmation that as a nation respect for each and every person is paramount regardless of age, religion, gender, ethnicity or sexuality."" Same-sex marriage: Who will legalize it next? Opposition Labour Party lawmakers helped the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill stay on track when Conservative rebels backed an amendment that might have derailed it at an earlier stage in the Commons. On Monday, Lord Alli said he was proud as a gay man serving in the House of Lords to have seen it pass the bill. ""My life and the lives of many others will be better today than they were yesterday,"" he said. But an opponent of the bill, Lord Framlingham, said that while the legislation would make many people very happy, the House of Lords should ""give some consideration to a much larger number of people, running into millions, whose lives will be less happy and whose concerns and problems will be increased by this legislation."" He said the House of Lords had been used to ""to bulldoze through an ill-thought-through bill, the ramifications of which the people have not begun to understand."" Here's what you need to know about same-sex marriage in the U.S. and worldwide . Coalition for Marriage, an umbrella group of UK people and organizations that support traditional marriage between a man and a woman, has collected more than 650,000 signatures on a petition opposing any attempt to redefine it. The Church of England is among the religious bodies opposed to the new legislation. Stonewall, a gay rights campaign group, welcomed the bill's passage through the Lords on Monday. ""It's impossible to express how much joy this historic step will bring to tens of thousands of gay people and their families and friends,"" Chief Executive Ben Summerskill said in an online statement. ""The bill's progress through Parliament shows that, at last, the majority of politicians in both Houses understand the public's support for equality, though it's also reminded us that gay people still have powerful opponents."" He said Stonewall would now redouble its efforts in Scotland ""so that every single gay person in Britain will soon enjoy full equality."" A law recognizing civil partnerships in England and Wales was passed in 2004. The issue of same-sex marriage has also divided other nations. A law that allows same-sex couples to marry and adopt was passed by France this year, despite large street protests and vocal opposition from religious groups. The move made it the ninth country in Europe to allow same-sex marriage. In the United States, two landmark rulings by the Supreme Court last month gave the gay and lesbian rights movement huge political and legal momentum. By the numbers: Same-sex marriage . The justices said legally married same-sex couples will now enjoy the same federal benefits as heterosexual couples, striking down a key provision in the Defense of Marriage Act. And although not granting a sweeping right of gays and lesbians to marry nationwide, a separate high court ruling effectively allows same-sex marriage to resume in California, the nation's most populous state.","NEW: The House of Commons approves amendments to the bill .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of additional police officers are being sent from Britain to Northern Ireland on Saturday after a night of loyalist rioting in Belfast left 32 officers injured across the city, police said. Officers came under attack Friday evening in north Belfast, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said, as loyalists protested a decision to bar a Protestant Orange Order march from returning through the mainly nationalist and Catholic Ardoyne area. Police footage posted on YouTube showed an angry crowd, with men wielding batons and throwing projectiles after police vehicles blocked their way. Police deployed water cannon in response. Lawmaker Nigel Dodds was briefly hospitalized after being struck on the head with a brick or a bottle thrown at police, authorities said. Trouble also broke out in south and east Belfast, leading to the arrests of seven men. Chief Constable Matt Baggott described the night's rioting as ""shameful and disgraceful."" He said that another 400 police officers would arrive in Northern Ireland from Britain on Saturday as backup in case of further disorder. More than 600 ""mutual aid"" officers from Britain are already in Northern Ireland to support local police. The Orange Order said early Saturday that it was suspending the protests it had called over the route the marchers were allowed to take Friday in north Belfast. The route was decided by the Northern Ireland Parades Commission, which rules on which marches are allowed to take place and which are banned, in an effort to keep friction to a minimum. July 12 is an important day for marches because it celebrates Protestant William of Orange's defeat of the Catholic King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Hundreds of parades take place across Northern Ireland each year, the majority involving the Orange Order and associated organizations, although pro-Irish nationalists also have marches. Most parades pass off peacefully, but when members of one community march near or through neighborhoods dominated by another, violence sometimes results.","Northern Ireland police chief says 400 additional officers are being drafted in from Britain .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish counter-terror police launched pre-dawn raids against scores of targets across Turkey's largest city Tuesday. At least 30 suspects were detained, Turkey's semi-official Anatolian Agency reported, in connection with anti-government protests that erupted in Istanbul in late May. What's driving unrest and protests in Turkey? The Turkish Interior Ministry, the Istanbul governor's office and Istanbul police declined to comment on the raids when contacted by CNN. But relatives and friends of some of those detained described the police raids while waiting outside Istanbul's main police headquarters for news about their loved ones. ""Ten to 13 of them (police officers) came around 5 a.m.,"" said Utku Caybas, a student at Istanbul University who said his 20-year old roommate, Cem Eraslan, was detained Tuesday morning. ""They took four computers, our notebooks and some cameras,"" Caybas added. Tugce Ozcelik told CNN police raided her family's home and detained her 19-year old brother Deniz at 5 a.m. ""They showed a picture of my brother and the search warrant to my father,"" Ozcelik said. She said her brother had recently completed high school and taken a university entrance exam. ""As a family we were all there at the Gezi events. We support the movement... they think that they can scare us from going out into the street but they can't,"" Ozcelik said. She was referring to an unprecedented series of protests that erupted after Turkish riot police repeatedly attacked a peaceful sit-in in Istanbul's Gezi Park in May. Demonstrators had initially organized a small Occupy Wall Street-style protest against government plans to bulldoze the park and replace it with a shopping mall. For several days, riot police repeatedly attacked sit-in participants with pepper spray, tear gas and water cannons. On May 30, demonstrators began fighting back, erecting barricades and attacking security forces with stones, bottles and slingshots. The mass civil disobedience and rioting quickly spread to other cities and towns across the country. Thousands of people were wounded in clashes, and at least one police officer and five demonstrators were killed. The most recent fatality was 19-year-old Ali Ismail Korkmaz, who died at a hospital last week after being beaten into a coma during demonstrations in the city of Eskisehir on June 2. Turkish media organizations have released security camera footage from that night showing men with gas masks and clubs chasing protesters and beating them in the streets of Eskisehir. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly denounced the protests, calling demonstrators ""terrorists"" and ""vandals."" Initially, Erdogan accused the demonstrators of being part of an international conspiracy aimed at toppling his elected government. He claimed that protests in both Turkey and Brazil were organized by the same shadowy ""center."" Over the last week, Erdogan has expanded the scope of the alleged conspiracy, claiming that mass protests and a military coup that toppled the elected government in Egypt were somehow linked to the demonstrations in Turkey. Turkish security forces have largely succeeded in crushing the demonstrations through widespread use of tear gas, water cannons and a growing number of arrests. But in doing so, the Turkish police and government have come under fire from international organizations like the European Parliament and Amnesty International for ""excessive use of force."" Last week, a coalition of medical organizations including the Boston-based Physicians for Human Rights and the World Medical Association issued an appeal for an international ban on the sale of tear gas to Turkey. ""Police have systematically used tear gas as a weapon on hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, firing tear gas canisters and capsules directly at protesters at close range,"" the medical groups wrote in an open letter addressed to Erdogan. They also called upon the Turkish government to ""prohibit all attacks on medical personnel who provide emergency assistance to injured protestors.""

"London (CNN) -- Six women who climbed one of Europe's tallest buildings Thursday in an effort to rally against Shell's Arctic drilling plan have been arrested, according to London's Metropolitan Police. They were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass and taken into custody, according to the police. The women from the environmental group Greenpeace said they dodged security guards around The Shard and, once on top, they planned ""to hang a huge work of art that captures the beauty"" of the Arctic. It is believed the group first climbed onto the roof of London Bridge Station before accessing the outside of The Shard, the police said. Earlier Greenpeace issued a statement about the climbers. ""They expect the grueling project to take most of the day,"" it read. ""The lead climbers are 'free climbing' (scaling the building without assistance) but are fixing safety ropes as they progress. They are carrying the huge work of art in backpacks and will install it this afternoon if they reach the summit. "" The six started their climb of the 1,016-foot-tall skyscraper at dawn and were live streaming the climb. They opted to climb The Shard because it towers over the oil giant's global headquarters on the South Bank of the Thames, according to the statement . ""Shell is leading the oil companies' drive into the Arctic, investing billions in its Alaskan and Russian drilling programs,"" it said. ""A worldwide movement of millions has sprung up to stop them, but Shell is refusing to abandon its plans."" The climbers are from the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, Poland, Holland and Belgium. The Shard released a statement saying it is working with authorities to ensure the climbers' safety, reading, ""Our primary focus is on the safety of the protesters, and of the workers and visitors to our building, which remains open today."" Greenpeace's environmental campaign aims to turn the area around the North Pole into a global sanctuary unavailable to industrialization. Shell defended its Arctic drilling. ""Oil and gas production from the Arctic is not new,"" it said in a statement. ""The Arctic region currently produces about 10% of the world's oil and 25% of its gas. If responsibly developed, Arctic energy resources can help offset supply constraints and maintain energy security for consumers throughout the world."" Regarding the protest, the oil giant said it respects the freedom of expression. ""We only ask that they do so with their safety and the safety of others, including Shell personnel and customers in mind,"" Shell said.","London authorities: Six women who attempted climb arrested .

"(CNN) -- Greece state broadcaster ERT is back on the air after being shut down by the government in June. The government, facing severe economic problems, had said earlier it decided to close the broadcaster while it created a smaller operation to cut costs. That prompted protests, and the European Broadcast Union president urged Greece to reconsider. In June, the country's top court ordered the government to restart ERT. The new signal is airing only old movies and documentaries, not live programs, according to government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou. Live broadcasts will be made later, Kedikoglou said. ERT had earlier said the decision to shut down the broadcaster meant 2,656 employees would lose their jobs. On Wednesday, employees still seemed very upset. They were holding a sit-in at ERT headquarters, lambasting what they called ""a fake imitation ERT."" CNN's Elinda Labropoulou contributed to this report.","Greek broadcaster ERT is back on the air .

"(CNN) -- At least six people were killed and 22 injured in a train derailment on Friday just south of Paris, French President Francois Hollande said. The announcement by Hollande revised the death toll down from seven dead in Bretigny-sur-Orge. Hollande arrived at the scene while rescue operations were under way. It was still unknown what caused the derailment of the regional train that left the Paris Austerlitz station Friday afternoon, said Guillaume Pepy, president of SNCF, the French national railway company. SNCF characterized it as an accident. Carrying about 370 people, the train was passing through the Bretigny-sur-Orge station. It did not have a scheduled stop there, Pepy said. It was bound for the city of Limoges, Valls said. The last four cars went off the track, the railway company said. One was lying on the track, it said. A photo airing on BFMTV showed part of the train lying on the station's platform. Hollande, who said he's traveled on the route before, announced three investigations -- a judiciary inquiry, an internal inquiry within SNCF and an inquiry that will be handled by the country's transport ministry. Firefighters were on the scene as rescue operations continued into the evening, Pepy added. Experts began their investigation at the scene. ""The first thought we all have is one of solidarity toward the victims and their families, and we feel a strong emotion because rail accidents are upsetting to the whole public,"" Pepy said, becoming emotional as he spoke. Earlier Friday, French police said that at least eight people had been killed, according to CNN affiliate BFMTV.

"(CNN) -- Radical cleric Abu Qatada was deported early Sunday by Britain to Jordan, where he is wanted on terror charges, the British Home Office said. The move ended a years-long legal battle to force the Jordanian national to leave the country. Abu Qatada was tried and convicted in absentia in Jordan in 1999 on two charges of conspiracy to cause explosions, court documents say. Britain has been trying to deport Abu Qatada since 2005, but his legal appeals have kept him in the country. Jordan will hold a fair trial for Qatada for alleged terrorist attacks in 1999 and 2000, government spokesman Mohammed Al-momani told the official Petra News Agency. The constitution will guarantee respect for human rights, he said. ""His departure marks the conclusion of efforts to remove him since 2001 and I believe this will be welcomed by the British public,"" Home Secretary Theresa May said in a written statement. ""I am glad that this government's determination to see him on a plane has been vindicated and that we have at last achieved what previous governments, Parliament and the British public have long called for. This dangerous man has now been removed from our shores to face the courts in his own country."" In January 2012, the European Court of Human Rights blocked Britain from sending him to Jordan because of fears that evidence obtained by torture could be used against him at the trial planned by the Middle Eastern country. UK authorities accuse Abu Qatada of raising funds for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and say he has publicly supported the violent activities of those groups. Videos of his preaching were found in a German apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks on the United States, including ringleader Mohammed Atta. Abu Qatada has denied the allegations against him. Also known as Omar Othman, Abu Qatada arrived in the UK in 1993 and applied for asylum on the grounds that he had been tortured by Jordanian authorities. He came to Britain on a forged United Arab Emirates passport, according to court documents, and claimed asylum for himself, his wife and their three children. He was ordered back to prison in April after evidence suggested he had violated his bail conditions. These include an order that prohibits him from allowing cell phones to be turned on in his house, and a ban on devices such as rewritable CDs and flash drives. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat and Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.","NEW: Jordan will hold a fair trial for Qatada for alleged terrorist attacks .

"Paris (CNN) -- France carries out mass surveillance of phone calls and e-mails in a program similar to the American one revealed by U.S. leaker Edward Snowden, a French newspaper has claimed. The program is run by France's secret service, the Directorate General for External Security, and also is used by six other French intelligence services, national daily Le Monde alleged in a report late Thursday. It says it is able to prove that the agency ""systematically collects electromagnetic signals from computers or phones in France, and also collects flows between French and abroad: all our communications are spied on."" ""All e-mails, SMS, records of telephone calls, accesses to Facebook, Twitter, are then stored for years."" The newspaper's report comes on the heels of wide European concern over the disclosures made by Snowden, a former U.S. National Security Agency contractor. EU envoys meet over claims of U.S. spying on European allies . Documents he's leaked to the media have led to allegations that the United States has been spying on its European allies as well as carrying out mass surveillance of telephone and Internet traffic. But Le Monde claims the French government's response has betrayed its conflicting interests. ""If revelations on the U.S. spying system (PRISM) led to a chorus of indignation in Europe, France only showed weak signs of protest. For two excellent reasons: Paris already knew. And it does the same thing,"" it said. Le Monde alleges that the French intelligence agencies' use of this huge store of data is ""on the margin of legality, and beyond serious control"" and that politicians who are aware of it turn a blind eye. It cites a parliamentary intelligence committee report from April in which it was said that ""since 2008, progress has been made on the subject of sharing capacities, especially in the field of electromagnetic intelligence, led by the DGSE for the profit of the intelligence community."" The French government has not yet responded to several requests from CNN for comment. At about the same time the allegations were published by Le Monde, French Interior Minister Manuel Valls gave a speech to guests at a July 4 celebration at the U.S. Embassy in Paris in which he was critical of the alleged U.S. spying on its allies. Espionage has no place in relations between allied countries, said Valls, adding that they should depend on reciprocal confidence to maintain their alliance. The occasion of his remarks, as a guest of the U.S. Embassy, led some of his fellow countrymen to complain that he had overstepped proprieties. Valls declined to answer subsequent questions from reporters about the claims made in Le Monde. National Assembly lawmaker Jean-Jacques Urvoas, a member of the governing Socialist Party, questioned the accuracy of Le Monde's report in his blog Friday, saying he did so ""because intelligence matters do not easily accommodate fantasies and inaccuracies."" ""While the legal framework concerning intelligence activities is indeed very incomplete, allowing our services to use wiretaps, the acquiring of technical data ... and limited access to files, the assertion that 'all of our communications are spied upon (and) stored for years' does not quite match the reality that I know,"" he wrote. Urvoas, who is president of the National Assembly's law commission and a member of a parliamentary intelligence committee, said that the tools used by services to intercept the Internet communications of French citizens operate within a legal framework laid down in 1991. ""French citizens are therefore not subject to uncontrolled, massive and constant espionage,"" he wrote.

"(CNN) -- The escalating drama at the top of Russia's Bolshoi Ballet is starting to rival its most theatrical stage productions. Six months after someone threw sulfuric acid on the ballet's artistic director, the Russian government has sacked the dance company's general director. ""Our actions are not spontaneous. They are part of the general concept of the Culture Ministry and the government aimed at gradual renovation and reforming the cultural institutions, preserving their traditions and experience,"" Russian Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky said Tuesday. Anatoly Iksanov still had more than a year left on his contract when he was fired Tuesday. He led the world-renowned ballet for 13 years, ushering in modern twists to the dance company that's now 237 years old. He invited controversial choreographers and composers, started online broadcasts of the theater's performances and introduced workshops for young performers with little or no background in classical ballet, Russia's RIA Novosti news agency reported. Vladimir Urin will now fill Iksanov's shoes. He must now restore the Bolshoi's reputation after January's attack on artistic director Sergei Filin mired the ballet in scandal. Filin was walking up to his Moscow apartment when a masked assailant tossed sulfuric acid onto his face, leaving him severely burned and nearly blinded. Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko has confessed to organizing the attack, but said Filin was only supposed to be beaten. He said he was shocked when he learned about the acid. Local newspapers quoted ballet members as saying Dmitrichenko was angry because he thought Filin was stifling the career of Anzhelina Vorontsova -- Dmitrichenko's girlfriend. Police arrested Dmitrichenko, as well as the alleged assailant and suspected getaway driver. Authorities painted Dmitrichenko as a villain -- the type of role Filin often cast him as in productions. CNN's Phil Black and Zarifmo Aslamshoyeva contributed to this report.","Anatoly Iksanov led the Bolshoi Ballet for 13 years and still had a year left on his contract .

"(CNN) -- Abortion is banned in Ireland, a historically devout Catholic country. Come Wednesday, that may change a little. Dublin lawmakers will vote on a bill that will permit a woman to terminate a pregnancy if it poses a threat to her own life, including if she is contemplating suicide. It's the last stipulation that has raised the ire of conservative lawmakers and religious citizens. Catholic leaders have called it a 'Trojan horse' leading to easy abortion access. But abortion rights proponents have said it will still be difficult for women to access the procedure, and passing the law will help stem the flow of Irish women traveling to Britain to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Woman's death in Ireland abortion case ruled 'medical misadventure' It is about ""saving lives"" when pregnant women are in danger, Prime Minister Enda Kenny has said. He said it won't change Ireland's general ban on abortion. His government wants the legislation, the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill 2013, to become law before the summer recess at the end of this month.

Kenny has acknowledged how uncomfortable the proposal may be in the majority Roman Catholic country. ""This is an issue that has been very divisive and contentious for over 30 years,"" he said. ""It's also an issue that is complex and sensitive, about which many Irish people have sincere and strongly held views.""

"(CNN) -- Family and friends attended a military funeral Friday to pay tribute to Lee Rigby, the British soldier killed in an attack in southeast London in May. Crowds gathered outside Bury Parish Church, near Manchester, and lined streets nearby to listen as the service was relayed by loudspeaker. Rigby's commanding officer, Lt. Col. Jim Taylor of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, described the 25-year-old as a man who was ""truly charismatic"" and ""larger than life."" Rigby had fulfilled a lifelong ambition to be a soldier and served with enthusiasm and courage, he said. The service was to be followed by a private family burial. Rigby was killed in a daylight attack on May 22 near the Woolwich barracks where he was based. Two men, Michael Adebowale, 22, and Michael Adebolajo, 28, are accused of his murder.

"(CNN) -- Two years after massive demonstrations forced out longtime leader Hosni Mubarak, Egypt finds itself right back where it started. This time, protests have led to the removal of Mohamed Morsy, the country's first democratically elected president. Some are calling it Egypt's ""second revolution."" ""Think of the millions of people who cheered Morsy after his election,"" said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics. ""Think of the millions of Egyptians who pinned their hopes on Morsy. ""A year later, now, the millions of Egyptians who cheered for Morsy are saying he must go."" They got their wish Wednesday, when the country's military leaders confirmed that it had ousted Morsy. How did it get to this point, and what's next for Egypt? A look at five key questions: . 1. Why have so many Egyptians protested against Morsy? Morsy, a strict Islamist aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood movement, was elected in June 2012 by appealing to all Egyptians. But his opponents say his government has been anything but inclusive since he took office, and they say it has failed to deliver on the people's aspirations for freedom and social justice. What is the Muslim Brotherhood? Morsy has also been accused of authoritarianism, forcing his conservative agenda through edicts and a narrow majority. He has squared off against Egypt's judiciary, the media, the police and even artists. ""The Muslim Brotherhood has not recognized that it has to take into account the 48% that didn't vote for it,"" CNN's Fareed Zakaria told Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. ""There are many people who feel that the constitution was rammed down the throats of a lot of Egyptians, that it contains within it many illiberal characteristics, things that are kind of the Muslim Brotherhood's Islamic agenda written into the basic framework of laws."" Egyptians are also frustrated with rampant crime and a struggling economy that hasn't shown improvement since Mubarak resigned. Unemployment remains high, food prices are rising and there are frequently electricity cuts and long fuel lines. Large-scale protests began the weekend of June 30, on the first anniversary of Morsy's election. 2. What has been the response from the other side? There have also been huge rallies in favor of Morsy. His supporters -- and many outside observers -- say that by getting rid of Morsy before his term is up, Egypt is circumventing the democratic process. ""Popular protests are the sign of a robust democracy. But the change in an elected government should be at the ballot box, not through mob violence,"" said Ed Husain, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Morsy stressed his legitimacy in a speech Tuesday and said he would not step down. ""The people of Egypt gave me the mandate as president,"" he said. ""They chose me in a free election. The people created a constitution. I have no choice but to bear responsibility for the Egyptian constitution."" Morsy even said he was ready to sacrifice his blood if that's what it took to uphold his constitutional legitimacy. But by the next day, he was out and the country's constitution had been suspended, according to Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi, the nation's top general. Morsy supporters in at least one Cairo plaza vowed to oppose the coup, chanting ""down with military rule."" In statements posted on the presidential Facebook and Twitter pages, Morsy said his ouster would be ""categorically rejected by all the free men of our nation."" 3. What's the military's role? When Mubarak resigned in 2011, the country's military took over leadership of the country and remained in power until Morsy's election. It had mostly stood on the sidelines until Monday, when it said it would intervene if Morsy did not come up with a solution to ""meet the demands of the people."" It gave Morsy 48 hours to accommodate his opponents or be pushed aside. ""We swear by God that we are ready to sacrifice our blood for Egypt and its people against any terrorist, extremist or ignorant,"" generals said in a statement called ""The Final Hours."" A military spokesman said the ultimatum was to push everyone toward national consensus, not seize power through a coup. But after the deadline expired Wednesday, there were reports from some of Morsy's supporters that a coup was under way. The state-run newspaper Al-Ahram, citing an unnamed presidential source, reported that Morsy was told by 7 p.m. (1 p.m. ET) ""that he is no longer a president for the republic."" 4. What's the U.S. stance? President Barack Obama spoke with Morsy this week and reiterated that the United States doesn't support a particular party or movement in Egypt, a U.S. statement said. Obama ""stressed that democracy is about more than elections."" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki denied, however, that Obama urged Morsy to hold early elections. Senior administration officials told CNN that a military coup would trigger U.S. legislation that calls for cutting off all American aid to Egypt. Psaki confirmed there were conditions on aid, but said ""that's way ahead of where we are in the process."" Zakaria said many Egyptians are suspicious of American intentions and influence. ""At some level, no matter what the United States does, it gets blamed,"" he wrote on the Global Public Square blog. ""For decades, it was blamed for supporting the military -- it was blamed for that even a year or two ago. Now the claim is that they're too pro-President Morsy."" 5. What's next for the Muslim Brotherhood and for Egypt? Morsy's removal offers no guarantee that the protests and violence will stop. It might even get worse. The Muslim Brotherhood still has significant support in the country, and those supporters could lash out. Zakaria called Morsy's removal ""a fairly dangerous move."" The Brotherhood was ""able to survive and flourish through five or six decades of complete persecution and an outright ban on their activities,"" he said, ""so they're not going to go anywhere. ""They will be very passionate about trying to push back on this, and that suggests the tensions in Egypt are likely to get a lot worse before they get better."" Long-term, many fear this could set a dangerous precedent. It could also create more instability, Husain said, for a country that depends on tourists and international investment for economic prosperity. ""Hopes were raised,"" he said, ""but now the democratic dream is coming apart before our eyes. ... Is it too late to save Egypt's democracy?"" CNN's Matt Smith, Hamid Alkshali, Reza Sayah, Tom Watkins, Dan Lothian, Amir Ahmed, Ben Brumfield, Ali Younes, Chelsea Carter, Schams Elwazer, Elise Labott, Ben Wedeman, Ian Lee, Housam Ahmed and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","Egypt is looking at its second power change in two years .

"Rome (CNN) -- The Catholic Church is on the verge of declaring late Pope John Paul II a saint, a Vatican source familiar with the process told CNN on Tuesday. The committee that considers candidates for sainthood voted Tuesday to credit the late pope with a second miracle, the source said, asking not to be named discussing internal Vatican deliberations. It is not clear which of several miracles under consideration would be credited to the late pope. Pope Francis must now sign off on the decision before it is official. John Paul was pope from 1978 until his death in 2005. Smoke signals: How is a new pope elected? He was fast-tracked to beatification when he died in 2005, and became ""the blessed"" John Paul II barely six years after his death -- the fastest beatification in centuries. For beatification, a person must be credited with a miracle by the Catholic Church. Pope Benedict, now pope emeritus, ruled in 2010 that John Paul II had miraculously cured a French nun of Parkinson's disease. Sister Marie-Simon-Pierre, a nun whose order prayed to the pope after he died, said she was cured of the disease, an ailment that also afflicted John Paul II. A second miracle would have to be confirmed for him to be officially canonized, or elevated as a saint of the Catholic Church.","A committee votes to credit former Pope John Paul II with a second miracle .

"(CNN) -- A suicide bomber has attacked and killed Bilal Shaikh, the security chief of Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, Police Superintendent Raja Umer Khitab said. The attack happened as Shaikh's car pulled up to buy fruit from a roadside stall in Karachi, Khitab said. Khitab told CNN that his early assessment is that the bomber was on foot and approached the passenger window where Shaikh was sitting and set off the bomb. Shaikh's vehicle was bullet proof, so Khitab believes the shock wave of the blast killed the security chief. The attacker also killed Shaikh's driver and a fruit stall vendor who was on the side of the road. Video showed wreckage of a white SUV.

"(CNN) -- A rain-triggered landslide killed at least two people and toppled 11 buildings Wednesday in southwest China, state-run media said, citing local authorities. The disaster occurred in Sichuan province's Dujiangyan city, fire officials said, according to the Xinhua news agency. Twenty-one people still were missing after the landslide, authorities in Dujiangyan said Thursday morning, adding that they are ""fully committed"" to rescue efforts. About 370,000 people and more than 81,000 acres of crops have been affected by the flooding, which has plagued the mountainous region since Monday. It has resulted in more than $40 million in direct economic losses, provincial officials said. Zhang Jiuchun is an interior designer living in Mianyang, the second-largest city in Sichuan. He told CNN in a phone interview that continuing flooding, along with landslides and mudslides, has paralyzed highway and rail services in many parts of the province. Zhang said suburban areas are seeing the most severe impacts. ""I think it's the worst since 1998,"" Zhang said of the disaster, referring to major flooding sweeping across China over a decade ago. Xinhua also reported that 352 stranded tourists have been securely moved out of Dujiangyan.

"Rome (CNN) -- A key religious text co-written by Pope Francis and Pope Emeritus Benedict, who stepped down earlier this year, was released by the Vatican on Friday. The encyclical, the first to be published since Francis became pope, sets out the priorities for the Roman Catholic Church. It's called ""Lumen Fidei,"" which is Latin for ""The Light of Faith."" The groundwork for the 84-page encyclical was laid by Benedict, the Vatican said in a media briefing, while Francis ""added further contributions to the existing first draft."" The introduction to the text, which is divided into four chapters, reiterates the importance of having faith in a man's life, it said. Francis writes that it is faith that helps man ""distinguish from good and evil"" and that he ""who believes, sees."" He stresses that in modern times, faith has become more important than in the past. In the first chapter, he refers to the biblical figure Abraham and explains faith as ""listening to the Word of God, the call to come from the isolated self in order to open up oneself to a new life and the promise of the future."" Subsequent chapters talk about the connection between ""faith and truth,"" evangelization and how faith is connected to the common good. Vatican Radio said the encyclical completes a trilogy of papal teachings on the three theological virtues -- faith, hope and charity -- that was begun by Benedict with his encyclicals ""Deus Caritas Est"" in 2005, and ""Spe Salvi"" in 2007. The encyclicals are circulated to Catholic bishops around the world and help outline the pope's thinking on doctrinal matters. The Vatican has declared 2013 to be the ""Year of Faith."" The latest encyclical is perhaps unprecedented in featuring the contribution of two living popes. Benedict XVI shocked the Roman Catholic world in February when he announced his resignation, making him the first pope to stand down in almost 600 years. Popes usually serve until their death. He has retired to a life of prayer and seclusion. CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","The encyclical is the first to be released under Pope Francis .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A wheelchair-bound man who set off a homemade explosive inside Beijing Capital International Airport over the weekend was a petitioner airing grievances, Chinese state media reported. The man, identified as 34-year-old Ji Zhongxing, was hospitalized after suffering injuries to his arm, which were not considered life threatening, state-run news agency Xinhua said. The agency said Ji set off the explosive at the airport's Terminal 3 on Saturday evening after he was stopped from handing out leaflets ""to get attention to his complaints"" outside the arrival hall. He then warned people nearby to get away before setting off the device. No other people were injured and flights at the airport were not affected. The man from Heze city, in Shandong province, said on his personal blog in September 2006 that he had been attacked and beaten by security guards outside a police station in 2005 after carrying a passenger on his motorcycle. He was paralyzed after the incident and petitioned for official compensation. The attack took place while Ji was working in Dongguan, a factory town in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Guangdong provincial authorities said on Sunday that they would look into the alleged unjust treatment, The China Daily reported. However, the newspaper also reported that Dongguan police said Ji was not attacked and was instead injured when he fell off his motorcycle. Police in Ji's home county said Dongguan authorities gave him 100,000 yuan (US$16,290) in compensation in 2010. His family did not know about the bomb plot, Xinhua reported. A witness to the explosion told the Beijing Youth Daily that Ji did not throw the bomb after activating it but held it in his hands. Photos posted on the Chinese social media site Sina Weibo showed a man in a peach shirt holding aloft a white device. Subsequent images showed thick smoke billowing through the terminal. Authorities say the device was similar to fireworks, Xinhua reported. The man's plight attracted some sympathy online. One user of the Twitter-like Weibo with the user name @Daidaibell said: ""He would only do it because they cornered him. If there's other way, he wouldn't go to such an extreme."" In China, people often petition local and national authorities about their grievances. In previous cases, frustrated petitioners have taken violent action. One man, Yang Jia, had tried to file a complaint about his treatment by police. In 2008, he stormed a Shanghai police station and killed six police officers. He was executed later that year. CNN's Zhang Dayu, Feng Ke and Steven Jiang contributed to this report from Beijing.","A man in a wheelchair detonates a homemade explosive at Beijing airport .

"(CNN) -- After two days of talks, North and South Korea are inching towards restarting operations at the joint Kaesong Industrial Park. The manufacturing complex run by North and South Korea, sits just north of the DMZ that separates the two countries. It housed operations of more than 120 South Korean companies and employed 53,000 Northern workers, before souring relations halted operations this spring. The last remaining South Korean workers left the facilities in May, although work had been winding down amid tensions. Workers left with belongings strapped onto their cars. For the first time since then, South Korean business personnel will be permitted to visit the complex and inspect their equipment Wednesday. On the same day, the two nations will hold another round of talks aimed at preventing such an outage and normalizing operations at Kaesong. South Korean businesses will be permitted to take their products as well as raw materials out of Kaesong. The North agreed to ensure safe passage for South Korean personnel, according to KCNA, North Korea's state-news agency and a statement from South Korea's Ministry of Unification. In its nine years of existence, the Kaesong Industrial Complex has served as a bellwether of North-South ties and the remaining vestige from the ""Sunshine Policy,"" when the two Koreas had an unprecedented level of engagement (1998-2008). North Korea has barred South Korean workers from entering the complex before in 2009 and 2009. ""We clearly pointed out that the recurrence of sudden stoppage by the DPRK's unilateral action must not happen,"" said Kim Hyung-suk, spokesperson for the Ministry of Unification. ""It also implies the expression of the government's will to normalize the Kaesong Industrial zone constructively in the future."" Kaesong is considered to be an important source of hard currency for Kim Jong Un's government as more than hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of goods are produced each year. Opinion remains divided on the potential restart for Kaesong. An editorial in the Wall Street Journal said that South Korea's president, Park Geun-hye is ""repeating one of the worst mistakes of the misbegotten 'Sunshine Policy' of a decade ago."" It warned that, ""Temporary closures of Kaesong are part of the Kims' toolbox. Shutting the complex down for good can't solve the problem entirely, but it should diminish their leverage and hasten the regime's eventual collapse."" Another editorial published during weekend in South Korea's JoongAng Daily, urged keeping Kaesong, saying that the venture must be kept alive to ""solve other inter-Korean problems."" Meanwhile, North Korea marked the 19th anniversary of the death of its founder, Kim Il Sung, Monday. KCNA reported that Kim visited the hall where his grandfather lies as well as his father, Kim Jong Il at Kumsusan Palace of the Sun. In recent weeks, North-South relations appear to have thawed. North Korea agreed to high-level talks with the South in June, though those talks were called off at the eleventh hour after disagreements about the level of the delegates who would represent each side. This weekend's talks occurred after North Korea restored a communication hotline with the South, which had been cut off repeatedly over the past four months.

"Mogadishu, Somalia (CNN) -- Five people were killed and 10 were wounded Friday by a car bombing near a peacekeeper convoy in the Somali capital, officials said. All of those killed or injured were Somali civilians, according to Abdikafi Hilowle, administration secretary for the Benadir region. The blast happened as a convoy of African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM, personnel passed a United Nations Development Program compound in Mogadishu, Hilowle said. This is the latest in a series of attacks in the city, the heart of an unstable nation beset with civil strife. Government and African Union forces have been battling Islamic militants for years in an effort to bring stability to the land. Last month, more than a dozen people were killed in an attack on the U.N. headquarters in Mogadishu. Friday's attack appeared to be aimed at the convoy, AMISOM spokesman Col.

"(CNN) -- Rescuers in China had pulled a total of 31 bodies from the wreckage from a landslide the size of a small town that rushed down a mountain earlier in the week. State-run CCTV reported on Friday that the number of people missing in and around the city of Dujiangyan was 166, up from 107 the previous day. The flooding that caused the landslide has destroyed 5,100 houses and damaged another 90,000. Rescuers continued digging through the debris in search of survivors and victims. The forecast calls for less rain, which should make the search easier. Flooding that triggered the landslide has affected 1.5 million people and inundated tens of thousands of acres of crops. The torrents have plagued the mountainous region since Monday, smashing bridges and knocking out power to thousands. They have washed away property worth more than $40 million, provincial officials said. Zhang Jiuchun is an interior designer living in Mianyang, the second-largest city in Sichuan.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A U.S. drone strike targeting a militant compound in Pakistan's volatile tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan has killed 16 people, Pakistani security officials said Wednesday. The officials said the attack early Wednesday struck a compound of the Haqqani Network, a group that carries out attacks against NATO forces in Afghanistan and travels back and forth across the porous border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The strike killed 16 militants and wounded five others in the Dande Darpakhel area near Miranshah in North Waziristan, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Officials had earlier given a higher death toll of 17. It wasn't immediately clear if any high-profile insurgent figures had been killed in the attack. The militants in the compound were from both Pakistan and Afghanistan, the officials said. The U.S. government has said strikes by the unmanned aircraft are a necessary part of the fight against militant groups. But the attacks have drawn deep opposition in Pakistan because of civilian casualties and the violation of sovereignty. Gunmen kill 11 at base camp in Pakistan . The Pakistani government ""strongly condemns the U.S. drone strike that took place in Miranshah,"" the country's foreign ministry said in a statement. ""The Government of Pakistan has consistently maintained that drone strikes are counter-productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives and have human rights and humanitarian implications,"" the ministry said. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has called for the United States to halt drone strikes in the country. Wednesday's attack appeared to be the deadliest since Sharif took office last month. In May, U.S. President Barack Obama defended the use of the drone program, but he stopped short of directly commenting on the strikes in Pakistan. Relations between Washington and Islamabad have been strained since the U.S. raid inside Pakistan in May 2011 that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The United States carried out the raid without notifying Pakistani authorities. Ties soured further after a NATO airstrike killed 24 Pakistani soldiers at a checkpoint near the Afghan border in November 2011. The drone strikes cause continued friction. In another outbreak of violence in the Pakistani tribal areas early Wednesday, officials said more than 50 militants attacked a checkpoint of the Frontier Constabulary, a paramilitary force. The attack to place about 40 kilometers southeast of the main city in the region, Peshawar, at a post where 15 members of the constabulary were stationed, said the force's chief, Commandant Majeed Marwat.

"(CNN) -- With sympathy, grief and some outrage, Chinese netizens expressed their condolences over the deaths of two Chinese schoolgirls in Saturday's crash landing of an Asiana Airlines flight at San Francisco International Airport. Ye Mengyuan and Wang Linjia, both 16, are the sole casualties of the ill-fated flight carrying 307 passengers and crew. They were part of a group of 35 teachers and students from a middle school in the eastern Chinese city of Jiangshan traveling to California for a summer camp program. The crash remained one of the top trending topics on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo on Monday, garnering over 1.7 million posts with the hashtag ""Boeing 777 crash."" It was also the leading topic on Tencent Weibo, with over 240,000 posts. ""May you rest in peace in Heaven. God will forever be with you,"" wrote user HaiDianYuAiLiSi, one of thousands of netizens who took to weibo platforms to express sadness over the loss of two promising young lives. Many attached photos of lit candles or appended their posts with candle icons in a symbolic vigil to honor the two girls. ""These kids were so young. Their families are so pitiful,"" wrote user JinShuRenDouFuNao, echoing broad sympathy for the victims' parents. Some netizens also hit out at China's one-child policy for leaving the parents bereft of surviving children. ""Now that the child is gone, her parents' last hope is also gone. It's really heartbreaking. If they had two or three children, it would at least be a bit better for her parents,"" wrote user BianBaXianK. An official apology posted by Asiana on Sina Weibo sparked a debate over the qualifications of the pilot, with rumors rapidly spreading among Sina Weibo users that the plane was flown by an ""intern."" ""Can an apology be exchanged for two lives? Asking interns to operate long-distance flights shows a complete disregard for human life. Even though tickets are cheap, you cannot treat people's lives like a joke,"" wrote user Kazumi Wawa. Asiana has announced that while the pilot was making his first landing with a Boeing 777 at San Francisco International Airport, it was not his first time flying to San Francisco. He has clocked 43 hours flying a Boeing 777 and piloted a total of about 10,000 hours, the airline said. As is often the case with social media, a handful of netizens displayed cavalier indifference to the victims, branding the girls overprivileged to be able to afford summer camp in the United States. A user named Yellow Submarine, who identified himself as a classmate of the victims, rallied, saying the trip ""was not a situation involving study abroad ambitions of wealthy people."" 'Oh, Lord have mercy': Witness captures fatal jet crash . ""Jiangshan is a third-tier city with relatively low consumption levels and my classmates' backgrounds were not as privileged as some netizens think,"" he added. Chinese citizens comprised 141 of the 291 passengers onboard the flight. Chinese president Xi Jinping expressed his condolences Sunday to all passengers and urged the Chinese Foreign Ministry as well as the Chinese consulates in San Francisco and South Korea to provide them with proper support, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Meanwhile, those watching from afar continue to express their sympathies. ""Life is so fragile, lovely girls who quickly came and went,"" wrote user Sinjin. ""You took with you your parents' hopes.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Just days after reports that Chinese police fired on a group of Tibetans marking the Dalai Lama's birthday, one of China's most senior officials vowed to continue with the fight against the exiled Tibetan leader. ""The Dalai Lama has long been engaged in secessionist activities, which run against both the common interests of people of various ethnic groups and the traditions of Tibetan Buddhism,"" said Yu Zhengsheng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, in a report by the state-run Xinhua news agency. He then called for an ""absolute fight"" against what he termed ""the Dalai clique"" as a means of protecting Chinese unification. ""Only when the Dalai Lama publicly announces that Tibet is an inalienable part of China since ancient time, gives up the stance of 'Tibet independence' and stops his secessionist activities, can his relations with the CPC Central Committee possibly be improved,"" Yu added. He was speaking during a visit Tuesday to a largely Tibetan area of the western province of Gansu. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising, has long denied China's assertion that he's seeking Tibetan independence. He says he wants only enough autonomy to protect its traditional Buddhist culture. Beijing rejects accusations of oppression, saying that under its rule, living standards have greatly improved for the Tibetan people. It makes centuries-old historical claims on the region. Meanwhile, London-based Tibetan advocacy group, Free Tibet, has claimed a Tibetan Monk was shot in the head, while at least six others received gunshot wounds, when Chinese security forces opened fire on a crowd in Tawu County in northwestern Sichuan Province on July 6. They were reportedly celebrating the Dalai Lama's 78th birthday at a sacred mountain. According to the U.S.-based International Campaign for Tibet, large numbers of armed troops were deployed and attempted to prevent people from making their offerings and gatherings. Then without warning, according to several Tibetan sources the group said, police opened fire on the unarmed crowd and used tear-gas. CNN could not confirm the authenticity of these reports, while Chinese officials could not be reached for comment. In recent years, reports have circulated about a growing number of Tibetans setting themselves on fire in protest against Chinese rule. So far, more than 100 people have resorted to self-immolation, Tibetan advocacy groups have said. Independently verifying reported self-immolations inside China is often difficult because of restrictions on reporting from the restive areas and the reluctance of local officials to comment on the accounts provided by foreign groups such as Free Tibet.","Top official calls for ""absolute fight"" against what he termed ""the Dalai clique""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The former lover and feng shui master to one of Asia's wealthiest women has been sentenced to 12 years in jail after being found guilty of forging a will that made him the beneficiary of her multi-billion-dollar fortune following a long-running case that transfixed Hong Kong. Peter Chan Chun-chuen, 53, formerly known as Tony Chan, was convicted on Friday after a jury found him guilty of forging the will of the eccentric billionaire widow Nina Wang, according to a statement from Hong Kong's Court of First Instance. He was also found guilty of a further charge of using a false instrument after the eight-member jury returned its verdict on Thursday after deliberating for two days. In his reasons for sentencing, Justice Andrew Macrae said Chan had shown ""not the slightest remorse"" for his conduct. ""I have no doubt from the evidence I have heard that you are nothing more than a clever and no doubt beguiling charlatan,"" he said in his judgment. Wang, the heiress known for her iconic pigtail braids and nicknamed ""Little Sweetie,"" died of cancer in 2007. After her death, a will was presented by Chan, who claimed he had been her confidante and lover for over 14 years. The will stipulated that her estate, valued at $4 billion, go to him. Wang's family disputed the will, allegedly signed by her in 2006, and a court finally dismissed the claims to the inheritance in 2011, ruling in favor of a charity run by Wang's siblings, Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd. In a long-running case that often seemed like a soap opera, the court heard details about the bizarre rituals associated with feng shui, adultery and the long love affair between one of Asia's most eccentric tycoons and a man 23 years her junior. Wang was the widow of Hong Kong industrialist Teddy Wang, who was kidnapped in 1990 and has never been seen since. Authorities declared him legally dead in 1999. The Wangs' Chinachem Group earned the family billions in property deals and was Hong Kong's largest private property developer. Chan, a former bartender and self-taught feng shui master, who is married with children, told the court Wang hired him in 1992 to find her missing husband. During testimony, the court heard how Wang ordered contractors to dig as many as 80 feng shui holes to be filled with pieces of jade at properties owned by Chinachem Group, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. Feng shui -- which literally translates as ""wind-water"" in English -- is a Chinese system of geomancy or divination that relies strongly on the orientation of buildings or objects to retain auspicious ""qi"" or energy. Many corporate buildings in Hong Kong are situated according to the tenets of feng shui. A court judgment said Chan had received about HK$2.1billion ($27 million) from her between 2005 and 2006. His lawyers contended the payments were intended to groom him for managing her estate. The South China Morning Post reported that Chan had recently renounced the practice of feng shui and converted to Christianity, also changing his name to Peter Chan. Reports said the court heard for the first time how Chan had 10 previous criminal convictions relating to credit cards applications in which he claimed to be a qualified medical doctor working in public hospitals. He was fined $HK20,000 ($2,600) in 1986 after pleading guilty to 10 counts, including obtaining property by deception and obtaining services by deception.","Former lover of billionaire Nina Wang, Peter Chan, sentenced to 12 years' jail for forgery .

"Urumqi, China (CNN) -- Urumqi, the capital of China's far-western Xinjiang Province, was calm but definitely tense Friday, four years after violent clashes left hundreds dead and exposed deep ethnic rifts in the region. In the days leading up to the anniversary, and in the wake of recent attacks that left 35 dead in Xinjiang, Chinese authorities have taken measures to thwart further unrest. Paramilitary police in camouflaged fatigues with automatic weapons and riot gear have been stationed outside key points throughout the capital, including government buildings, banks and major intersections. While it is not unusual for there to be a visible police presence in a city known for past troubles, the number of armed troops on the streets has increased dramatically -- one main street next to a local theater in the city was backed up with a column of police trucks, armored personnel carriers and other riot-control vehicles. According to tourist operators and local residents, the government has also banned all night markets and non-tourist public events to avoid crowds gathering at this sensitive time. Periodic bursts of violence are nothing new in Xinjiang, a resource-rich region of western China where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. Uyghurs have complained of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces in Xinjiang, despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony. In China as a whole, Han Chinese account for 92% of the population. They now make up about 40% of the population of Xinjiang, where Uyghurs used to be predominant. The violence last Wednesday -- when police stations were attacked by a mob in the remote township of Lukqun, about 250 kilometers southeast of Urumqi -- was the worst the region has seen since 2009, when rioting between the two ethnic groups left around 200 people dead and 1,700 injured in Urumqi. This followed clashes in April when 21 people were killed in Xinjiang's Kashgar prefecture. The government has blamed recent attacks on ""gangsters"" and ""religious extremists"" who they claim have links to foreign jihadi groups. But many scholars and Uyghur diaspora groups dispute this official interpretation. ""The increasing frequency with which these incidents occur illustrates the PRC's reticence to address the root causes of the tensions that are escalating,"" said the World Uyghur Congress (WUC), a Germany-based Uyghur advocacy group. It used an abbreviation of People's Republic of China to describe China. Meanwhile, Chinese state media has widely reported on other measures taken by local authorities to curb further unrest ahead of Friday's anniversary. The local public security department in Xinjiang has offered a 50,000 to 100,000-Yuan (US$8,162 to 16,319) reward for information regarding what they called ""separatist activities,"" the China Daily reported. It also released a wanted list of 11 suspects, encouraging residents to provide information. Police also called on the public to hand in any ""dangerous knives, explosives and propaganda materials on terrorism or violent crimes"" they may have -- police officers in Urumqi were actually registering knives this week, with blades more than 8 inches confiscated. ""I can't display anything longer than this,"" said one local merchant who had just been registered by police. Rumors have also been rife in this city before and during the July 5 anniversary. Uyghur restaurants are struggling to get Han customers at times because of rumors that they could be looking to poison their customers. In the center of the capital, street vendors say domestic tourist numbers, normally at their peak at this time of year, are dramatically down because of the fear of attacks. But despite the heavy police presence and the rumors, the city continues to function. Though the Xinjiang International Grand Bazaar, a major tourist attraction, was largely quiet this week, other shopping streets teemed with locals bargaining for a range of products, from scarves to fruit. They didn't seem to pay much attention to the paramilitary police units who now patrol 24 hours a day -- some Han Chinese tourists were even taking photos of the patrols. But this remains a divided city. Uyghurs and Han Chinese generally frequent different shops, live in different neighborhoods and go to different schools. But most people seem reluctant to speak about these divisions, a sign perhaps of the tightening grip the security forces have over this remote city.","China has deployed armed police in cities in Xinjiang in past week .

"Ngqwara, South Africa (CNN) -- For weeks, South Africans have been holding a vigil for their first democratically elected president, Nelson Mandela. The 94-year-old statesman has been lying in a hospital in Pretoria for more than a month. Away from the capital, in the rolling farmlands where Mandela was born and raised, many South Africans believe his precarious condition has been adversely affected by a messy public dispute between members of his family. ""Some of us believe it could be that the suffering [Mandela] is enduring in the hospital at the moment has to do with the fact that his dispute has not been resolved,"" said Patikile Holomisa, a lawmaker as well as the president of the Congress of Traditional Leaders. ""We believe that our ancestors through their spirits are looking after us,"" Holomisa added. ""When we displease them, they bring calamity; all sorts of discomfort to the family."" The family dispute erupted into full public view last week when one of Mandela's daughters took one of his grandsons to court, after accusing him of secretly moving the remains of three of Mandela's buried children from the family cemetery in 2011. Makaziwa Mandela embraced her attorney when she won the case in a regional high court in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province. ""It's a private matter,"" was her only comment to the media at the court. The next day a sheriff used heavy metal pincers to snap open the padlock on a gate at the village of Mandela's grandson, Mandla. South African authorities retrieved three coffins and bought them for reburial in Qunu, the small village where the former president maintains a modest home. ""I still feel that it was a premature act,"" said Mandla Mandela, in an exclusive interview with CNN on Wednesday. ""The issue should have been exhausted through internal structures of the family and unfortunately that wasn't seen,"" he added. The 39-year-old grandson was speaking on a windy hilltop in the village of Ngqwara, where he had just distributed blankets to several dozen elderly men and women. The crowd began the ceremony by reciting prayers. Later, some elderly women sang and danced in gratitude after receiving their donations. Mandla Mandela is a chief, or traditional ruler, in this poverty-stricken corner of South Africa. In this deeply traditional heartland, there are other prominent community leaders who agree that the Mandela family should have turned to distinctly African methods of mediation to solve their dispute, rather than Western-style courts. ""If the people are going to abandon the roots to which Madiba belongs and go and hang on to the branches of a foreign tree, such as the Westernized courts, then there is going to be a problem,"" said Holomisa. The Mandela family dispute has exposed differences between the culture and values of rural black South Africa and the country's modern legal and medical system. Some here argue it is unnatural and unfair to keep an ailing man alive with modern medical machines. Others fear Mandela may suffer longer in hospital, because the remains of his three children were moved without accompanying prayers. ""There was no ritual that that was performed when the bones were moved,"" explains Vuyo Teti, a 25-year-old agricultural university student. ""The old people are saying you need to consider the spirit and the spiritual being, not only the bones."" Though raised in Qunu, Mandela migrated as a young man to South Africa's largest city Johannesburg, where he eventually opened the country's first black law firm. Mandela then spent the bulk of his adult life, either imprisoned by the former Apartheid regime or struggling in freedom to establish democracy in South Africa. Over the last decade, he retired from public view and chose to move back to the land of his childhood. Traditional community leaders like Holomisa cite that as proof that Mandela wished to return to his roots. ""He straddled both worlds, the African and the western,"" said Holomisa. ""This man was a traditional man,"" he added. ""And in the twilight of his life, he should be allowed to be who he was.""","In South Africa's heartland many believe Mandela's condition harmed by family dispute .

"KHARTOUM, Sudan (CNN) -- Rebels aided by South Sudan bombed an oil pipeline in the disputed district of Abyei, a Sudanese army official said on Thursday. ""At 9 p.m. on Wednesday, a group belonging to the Justice and Equality Movement...aided by South Sudan launched an attack, specifically ... into Sudanese territory,"" said Al-Sawarmi Khalid, the Sudanese army's spokesperson, in a statement to the semi-official Sudanese Media Center (SMC). ""This renegade group was given technical support from the South Sudanese military which enabled it to bomb an oil pipeline in the area of Ajaja inside the administrative borders of Abyei,"" the statement continued. According to Khalid, a fire stemming from the bombing lasted for several hours, ""but it has been put out and the pipeline is now being repaired."" On Saturday, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir ordered the shutdown of pipelines carrying South Sudanese oil through Sudan, accusing South Sudan of supporting rebels in Sudan. South Sudanese military spokesperson Philip Aguer could not be reached to comment. A statement by the The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), however, denied involvement in the attack.""The Justice and Equality Movement did not bomb the pipeline between the Difra oil filed and Heglig,"" the statement read. JEM refuted the allegation that it receives support from South Sudan and said it does not have any presence in Abyei. Instead, JEM accused the Sudanese government of not being able to carry out its plans with shutting the flow of South Sudanese oil, and of being was responsible for the blast. ""Since the regime was not able to implement this decision, it came up with a ridiculous scenario of bombing the pipeline between Difra and Heglig and then accusing JEM of responsibility,"" the group said. South Sudan became independent from Sudan in July 2011, following a popular referendum and a war that left nearly 2 million people dead. But the two nations have remained at odds on some issues, including defining their borders and oil exports. When they separated, South Sudan acquired three quarters of Sudan's oil reserves. The two countries have been at odds about how much landlocked South Sudan should pay to use a pipeline and processing facilities in the north. In January 2012, South Sudan shut down the production of oil and in April as both countries nearly slipped into all-out war. In September 2012, under international pressure, the leaders of both countries signed a cooperation agreement that addressed their unresolved issues, and in March 2013, both sides agreed to resume oil production.","A bombing sparked a fire at the pipeline that lasted several hours, an official said .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- At sunset, the smell of food simmering in dozens of pots starts to fill the air on 15th Avenue. Soon after, as if summoned by the aroma of meat and spices, a steady stream of cars starts rolling in, pulling up to the food stalls and carts where local women armed with serving spoons prepare to ladle out portions of South African comfort food -- ox tripe known as mogodu, chicken feet, beans and maize dusted with spicy pepper. A woman in a red dress loudly licked her lips as she waited to collect several containers full of food. ""Its food from the homeland,"" she said as she then hurried away to her waiting car. ""My husband's going to be very happy."" The neighbourhood that hungry South Africans flock to on Monday nights is a township called Alexandra, or Alex. This densely-populated district is often associated with poverty and crime. Squatters, many of them immigrants from other sub-Saharan countries in Africa, live in wretched conditions in shacks and derelict industrial buildings on the edges of the township, and within view of Sandton, one of the city's wealthiest, leafy enclaves. Twenty-five-year-old Maurice Modipa wants to change the township's negative image. ""More than anything, I want to put Alex on the map,"" he said. ""In terms of getting people into Alex and change the stigma that we have, I just want people to see it from my point of view."" Modipa and his brothers are transforming their father's small liquor store into a nightclub that they hope will one day offer panoramic views of Alexandra township. Their bar -- called ""Stoep,"" which is a South African term for the veranda where locals gather next to the house -- is part of a larger attempt to attract members of the country's rising black middle class back to the townships. Workers at Stoep set up amplifiers and haul in cases of beer under the watchful eye of 66-year-old Shimmi Modipa, who first started selling beer to his friends at this property decades ago, when it was little more than a collection of shacks on 15th Avenue. ""I used to call it 'Amstel Lounge,' because it's where we used to entertain myself, my friends and visitors,"" the elder Modipa said. Deep inequalities . In the days of apartheid, Modipa said the white minority-ruled government confined black South Africans to the township after dark. He also said it was difficult to start a business, since white-owned banks refused to issue loans to blacks. And though the poverty that is visible today in Alexandra reflects the deep income inequalities and high unemployment that continue to plague South Africa, Modipa said this working class neighborhood has come a long way in the last 20 years. ""There were no tar roads, there were just gravel roads.There were no sewage systems ... in the olden days [we had] bucket systems,"" Shimmi Modipa said. Pointing to the paved road outside his family's bar, Modipa said, ""We are still saying thanks, thanks, thanks. My thanks to our Papa Madiba,"" referring to Nelson Mandela, the first democratically-elected black president of South Africa, who has been lying in critical condition for weeks in a hospital in Pretoria. ""Mandela made this possible."" By 9pm, loud dance music was blaring from amplifiers in the Modipa bar. Patrons arrived on roaring motorcycles, in Mercedes sedans and expensive sport utility vehicles They swayed to the music in the bar's unfinished open structure, sipping beer and whiskey and munching on chicken feet, apparently oblivious to the winter chill. Maurice Modipa danced and played DJ behind a laptop with big headphones on his ears. The customers who used to drink beer at Stoep have changed dramatically in the last decade. ""We know quite a few people who have made something of themselves...economically,"" Maurice Modipa said later. The scene of affluent South Africans returning from wealthy suburbs to the poor township for a taste of their roots was a homecoming of sorts. This uniquely South African night out showed much progress has been made since the end of apartheid, and highlighted how far the country still has to go to overcome its deep social and economic challenges.","In the days of apartheid, black South Africans were confined to the township after dark .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- A UK terror suspect whose trial on terror charges reconvened Wednesday in Kenya served jail time with one of the men who carried out the 2005 London bomb attacks and may have been influenced by him, a British intelligence report reveals. The report, which was shared with Kenyan counterterror authorities and was obtained by CNN, suggests that Jermaine Grant developed a relationship with the London bomber, Jermaine Lindsay, while they were held at a London facility. British intelligence officials believe Grant was radicalized during that prison term. He is facing three counts of conspiracy to commit a felony. A source said the facility where Grant and Lindsay met was Feltham Young Offenders Institution, the same prison in which U.S. ""shoe bomber"" Richard Reid was allegedly radicalized, and where July 21 attack leader Muktar Said Ibrahim did time. Grant was being held at Feltham for non-terror-related offenses, the source said. Grant is accused of having connections with the al Qaeda-linked Somali group Al Shabaab, and then being dispatched as part of a cell to carry out attacks in Kenya's port city of Mombasa. He's suspected of targeting hotels frequented by Western tourists in the city. Police allege he worked with Lindsay's widow, British national Samantha Lewthwaite, who is also wanted by Kenyan police on terror charges but remains at large. Grant, who was arrested in late 2011, is being tried in a court complex within a maximum security prison because Lewthwaite hatched a plan to break him out, Kenyan authorities say. The alleged jailbreak plot has contributed to numerous delays in judicial proceedings. Kenyan counterterror police say they found the same kind of bomb-making materials as were used in the London bombings at the last known residence of Lewthwaite in Mombasa. Among the seized items police presented to reporters were firearms, munitions and chemicals including hydrogen peroxide. 'Bomb-making materials' The court in Mombasa heard Tuesday that British counterterror officers who flew in to monitor proceedings had brought with them a large volume of evidence prepared by the counterterrorism team of London's Metropolitan Police. Grant's defense team asked the court to give them more time to study the evidence, which was provided to them that day, saying they would need to consult technical experts. Lawyer Chacha Mwita also objected to the court hearing the testimony of three Metropolitan Police officers before the defense team has time to study the reports. Warda Breik, believed to be Grant's Kenyan wife, is also charged in the case. She arrived in court Tuesday flanked by close family members, including her mother. The July 7, 2005, bombings targeting London's public transit network killed 52 people and the four bombers. London bomb survivor says humanity can beat despair .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Basma Khalfaoui was helping her daughters prepare for school the morning she heard the gunshots. Unfamiliar with the sound, she thought maybe children were throwing rocks outside. Her curiosity drew her to the balcony of the family's third floor apartment in the quiet Tunis suburb of Menzah, where she found her husband's colleague standing next to his car, panic-stricken. ""They hit him,"" he cried out. As she rushed downstairs, her mind raced. ""At the beginning, I thought maybe they hit him with a stone or a knife, but not with a gunshot,"" Basma explained. After all, it wouldn't be the first time Basma's husband, attorney and opposition leader Chokri Belaid, had been assaulted in broad daylight. It was only a few days earlier that a mob of radical Islamist Salafists attacked him during a meeting of the Democratic Patriots Movement in Kef, a town about 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Tunis. ""One month before his death, as he was leaving a cafe in Pastor Square in Tunis, a number of people came looking for him and shouting his name while holding sticks in their hands,"" Basma added. As the most visible leader of Tunisia's Popular Front -- a coalition of a dozen leftist political parties formed last October -- Belaid had been tasked with countering the rise of the Islamist-led Nahda party, which swept into power following the revolution that toppled longtime President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. Belaid had prepared for leadership from an early age. He was a legend of Tunisia's student movements and eventually founded the leftist Watad party. A lifelong human rights advocate, he championed democratic reform, secularism, and vehemently confronted the rise of radicalism. And as a result, he and his family were often the target of death threats, harassment, and on occasion, violence at the hands of his political opponents. ""He was being watched before the revolution. After the revolution he got direct and written threats. The last threats came from the mosques, in which the Imams there called for him to be killed,"" Basma says. ""They always used me and the two girls to threaten Chokri. He used to tell me about these threats in his own way in order not to put fear in us."" But as Basma approached her husband slumped in his car, she discovered the worst. ""I found him in the car. It was locked but all the windows were broken. I saw the traces of gunshots, and at that time, my only concern was to save him. But I made sure not to touch anything in the car for the sake of investigation."" The assailants, according to witnesses, had waited for Belaid to emerge from his home. As he got into his car, a gunman approached and fired four shots which struck Belaid in the head and chest, then fled by motorcycle with the help of an accomplice driver. ""Opposite to us, there was a medic. He lived next door... He was also worried so I calmed him down. My only concern at that time was taking Chokri to the hospital as soon as possible."" Not long after the shooting, Chokri Belaid was pronounced dead at a nearby clinic. But this wasn't just another politically motivated murder in another unstable Arab country. Prior to Belaid's murder on February 6, Tunisia had been widely hailed as the poster child of the Arab Spring. Having ousted Ben Ali and having held free and fair elections, and while their Arab counterparts in Egypt, Libya, and Syria continued to struggle under the rule of dictators desperately clinging to power, Tunisia was setting the precedent for democratic transition in the modern Arab world. And though President Moncef Marzouki pledged Belaid's ""odious assassination"" would not derail Tunisia's democratic transition - it did just that. The assassination, the first time since Tunisia's independence in 1956 that a politician had been the target inside the country, set off a wave of political setbacks which caused a security vacuum, creating a vicious cycle of instability that has come to characterize, and still plagues, Arab Spring nations in their post-dictator transitions. Building on an already growing dissent against the Islamist Nahda party, the opposition immediately took to the streets following Belaid's death. Three days of persistent outrage by hordes of Belaid supporters forced Prime Minister Jebali to the negotiating table. He proposed handing over key ministries, such as justice and foreign affairs, to independents in an attempt to form a more inclusive government and avoid further political instability and pledged to step down if his efforts were not successful. But despite gaining broad support from the general public and the opposition, Jebali also succeeded in alienating himself from his party's most-ardent supporters. Just 13 days after the Belaid assassination, Jebali resigned as prime minister. On February 22, ruling party leaders elected serving interior minister Ali Laarayedh to replace Jebali. Laarayedh had been a founding member of Nahda and its spokesman from 1981 until 1990 when he was imprisoned by the Ben Ali regime. A party loyalist and hardliner, the election of Laarayedh signaled the Islamist-led party had no intentions of relinquishing any substantial power. Few Tunisians had probably heard of Basma Khalfaoui before her husband's death, but in the last two months she has attained rock star status in her country. Leftist supporters clearly lacking the charismatic charm and leadership that died with Chokri, rallied behind Basma who was adored for her strength and determination immediately following her loss. It wasn't long before the widow would become the new face of Tunisia's opposition. Turn on the television or open a newspaper in Tunisia and chances are Basma's picture will be there. ""The number of people who attended the funeral and the spotlight I am put under has increased the amount of responsibility I am feeling. The whole thing has changed the destiny I have chosen, and yet I feel I am in the middle of the way,"" Basma says as she clutches tissues with one hand and constantly fiddles with a charm on her necklace bearing the image of her late husband with the other. Being a political celebrity was not part of Basma's plan. She had long ago left her activist life behind to raise her family. Like her husband, Basma was a leader in Tunisia's student movement in the General Union of the Students of Tunisia, a group of leftist and nationalist students concerned with the rising Islamist presence on campus. Following her time at university, she went on to join the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women, a prominent part of the Ben Ali opposition. ""The negativity here is that I am a person who dislikes spotlights. My concern is my daughters, but now I feel the amount of responsibility towards the people of Tunisia. I don't want to collapse, for the sake of Tunisia. I feel proud for spreading courage in the atmosphere. Nahda party wants to spread fear and I want to stop that feeling,"" Basma says. As she spoke, a local Tunisian TV station was still breaking down its equipment which cluttered her modest apartment. Soon, another would arrive for yet another interview where she would, once again, relive the morning that changed her life. ""Undoubtedly, his death is a loss to me and to our two daughters. To me, he was a husband, friend, colleague in the same party and profession."" Later that week, Basma and thousands of supporters donning Chokri Belaid masks and carrying posters bearing Chokri's trademark mustache and mole, an image which has come to represent the revival of revolutionary fervor in Tunisia, gathered at her husband's graveside. Chokri's father and members of the Popular Front addressed the crowd flooding the Tunis cemetery over a loudspeaker between chants of ""who killed Chokri?"" Rally leaders then marched to Mohammad Bouazizi Square, named in honor of the street vendor who lit himself on fire which triggered Tunisia's revolution. The square was soon filled from curb to curb with activists. Barbed wire lined the streets as hundreds of Tunisian police, equipped with batons and riot gear, looked on suspiciously. That afternoon, the eager crowd lining Habib Bourguiba Avenue, the birthplace of the Arab Spring, parted as a large truck crept past, draping behind it a giant, cascading Tunisian flag. Coming to a stop in the center of Bouazizi Square, Basma emerged from behind the flag to address to thousands of supporters and well-wishers. The day ended without incident, a stark contrast from the funeral procession for Belaid that just a few weeks earlier had ended in violent clashes between supporters of the leftist martyr and those of the ruling Nahda party. Though the opposition was able to display its newfound strength without backlash, it was just another day without justice for Basma. Despite her obvious fatigue, she refuses to rest until those that are responsible for her husband's death are brought to justice. But buried beneath the sadness and anger, Basma still clings to hope. ""I still feel optimistic as he was before he died. He once said, ""if they assassinate me, a flower will grow."" Now, thousands of flowers have grown in Tunisia.""","Widow of opposition leader reluctantly became a Tunisian political celebrity .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama flies across the Atlantic on Wednesday for a trip that takes him to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania, his second visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office. The trip aims to bolster investment opportunities for U.S. businesses, address development issues such as food security and health, and promote democracy. It comes as China aggressively engages the continent. The Asian nation is pouring billions of dollars into Africa, running oil and mining firms, and replaced the United States in 2009 as the largest trading partner. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, will be in Africa at the same time. Bush has made multiple visits to Africa since leaving office, and will be in Zambia next week, where he's working with his global health initiative to renovate a cervical cancer screening and treatment center. While the 44th and 43rd president are not scheduled to meet, first lady Michelle Obama and her predecessor, Laura Bush, will attend the African First Ladies Summit in Tanzania on July 2. Obama's trip is being overshadowed by the declining health of South Africa's revered former president, Nelson Mandela, who is in critical condition at a Pretoria hospital. Mandela, who emerged from prison after 27 years to lead South Africa out of its dark days of apartheid, is considered the father of modern day South Africa. Obama will be in Senegal Thursday and Friday. He arrives in South Africa on Saturday, where he will spend the weekend taking part in a host of activities, including meeting with the nation's leaders and visiting Robben Island, where Mandela spent a majority of his prison term. He will spend Monday and Tuesday in Tanzania, and is expected back in Washington on July 3. The president made a brief trip to Ghana during his first term in July 2009.

"(CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela has completed his recovery from a lung infection and gallstone surgery and is gradually getting back to his normal routine, a spokesman said Sunday. Presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said Mandela, who has not appeared in public since 2010, continues to receive treatment at his home in Houghton, a suburb of Johannesburg. Mandela was hospitalized for a lung infection in early December and a week later underwent surgery for removal of gallstones. He was discharged from the hospital after a two-week stay . Keep Nelson Mandela in thoughts and prayers, Zuma says . During the time of apartheid in South Africa, Mandela was convicted of sabotage and was imprisoned for 27 years until 1990. He and former President F.W. de Klerk, who dismantled apartheid, shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. A year later, Mandela became the nation's first black president. In November, South Africa issued banknotes bearing Mandela's picture. Despite his rare public appearances in recent years, Mandela retains his popularity and is considered a hero of democracy in the nation. Mandela's impact has extended far beyond the borders of his own country. After he left office in 1999, he was involved in mediating conflicts from Africa to the Mideast. Mandela, 94, also was treated for an acute respiratory infection in January 2011. The next month he had surgery for an abdominal hernia.

"(CNN) -- Egyptian troops canvassed streets Friday after a fresh spate of violence in the volatile North African nation, hoping to prevent a repeat of the bloody, chaotic revolution of two years ago, a military spokesman said. Military forces have been deployed nationwide to protect Egyptian citizens and property, Ahmed Ali told the MENA state news organization, as reported by Ahram Online, another official news agency. The Ahram story recalled how police stations came under attack, prisons were broken into and shops were looted in the unrest of early 2011. ""These measures are being taken to avoid a January 28, 2011, scenario,"" the spokesman said. Those protests and a government crackdown culminated in the ouster of longtime Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Friday's move follows deadly clashes in Alexandria and elsewhere, many of them targeting Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. Four members of that Islamist group -- which was banned under Mubarak but has risen to power since his fall, most notably in the form of President Mohamed Morsy who has been in office for a year -- have been killed in recent days. The Alexandria office of the Brotherhood's political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, was attacked Friday. Health Ministry spokesman Yehya Moussa said one man was killed by a gunshot wound to the head during clashes outside party headquarters. And on Friday night, he said that a 21-year-old American had died in the Alexandria clashes. The young man's family identified him as Andrew Driscoll Pochter, a Kenyon College student living in the Egyptian port city to teach English to 7- and 8-year-old children. Their understanding was that he'd been witnessing the events ""as a bystander (when he) was stabbed by a protester."" ""He went to Egypt because he cared profoundly about the Middle East, and he planned to live and work there in the pursuit of peace and understanding,"" his family said. ""Andrew was a wonderful young man looking for new experiences in the world and find ways to share his talents."" State media reported that 70 were injured in the same clashes. Read more: Ready for Egypt's 'second revolution?' Two people were shot dead Thursday when armed men attacked the Muslim Brotherhood officers in Zagazig, Morsy's hometown, spokesman Gihad Haddad said. The identity of the shooters is unknown, but Haddad said witnesses heard the gunmen shouting ""down with Morsy."" Another Muslim Brotherhood member died from injuries he suffered in clashes in Mansoura, Haddad said. ""I feel rage and the inability to act,"" he said. ""I feel there is a treasonous police force that's allowing this to happen."" Morsy gave a speech this week highlighting his achievements during his first year in office. But the largest opposition umbrella group said Morsy did not address his shortcomings, and issued a statement calling for snap presidential polls, a new government and constitutional amendments. Morsy's speech ""only deepens our resolve to press our demands for early presidential elections in order to achieve the aims of the revolution, most important of which is social justice,"" the statement said. Haddad said that the Brotherhood's policy is to never respond to attacks against it with violence. However, he seemed to suggest that the Brotherhood's leaders may not be able to stop reprisal attacks. ""I don't think organization will matter that much. I am concerned because, if anything, these killings are infuriating the youth. All the martyrs are Brotherhood youths,"" he said. He said the Brotherhood would go ahead with planned demonstrations Friday in Cairo followed by an indefinite sit-in. If the sit-in extends to Sunday, it would coincide with mass demonstrations planned by opposition factions in front of the presidential palace. Governments around the world are paying attention -- at the least, to make sure that their own workers and citizens are safe.

"Cairo (CNN) -- President Mohamed Morsy marked a year in office by admitting Wednesday to having made mistakes but vowing to correct them. ""I want to tell you, frankly, that I made mistakes in many things, and I was right in several other things,"" he said in a televised address from the Cairo International Conference Center. ""Mistakes were made, but correction should be done,"" he said to applause. Morsy then launched into a defense of his record and a list of plans to improve on it. He said he had ordered the interior minister to form a unit to combat ""thuggery"" and terrorism, including the blocking of roads, according to the state-run Ahram Online news agency. He announced the formation of a committee to examine proposed constitutional amendments and invited political parties to submit their proposals as soon as Thursday. The president further ordered the formation of a ""national reconciliation committee"" comprising representatives of political parties, the Al-Azhar Mosque, the Coptic Orthodox Church, so-called revolutionary forces and nongovernmental organizations. The committee, he said, will be charged with promoting ""national dialogue"" among political factions. Morsy said he was authorizing government ministers and regional governors to sack any officials found to have contributed to recent crises or shortages. In response to Egypt's gasoline shortage, which has resulted in long lines outside the stations, the president said any gas station found to be hoarding fuel would lose its license. Finally, Morsy ordered government ministers and provincial governors to appoint advisers younger than 40 years of age to their respective teams. He stressed that young people -- who are among his fiercest critics -- must assume a greater role in the country's affairs and vowed to lower the unemployment rate from 13% to 8%. ""The youth were never given a chance to play a role in the country, and for that I am sorry,"" he said. ""I will make sure they do soon."" Morsy highlighted his administration's efforts to serve the poor, saying that the monthly minimum wage has risen to 700 Egyptian pounds and ""will hopefully"" reach 1,500, public sector salaries have nearly doubled and more than 50,000 small-scale farmers have had their loans forgiven. Morsy's remarks came on the same day that at least one person was killed and 298 were injured when his supporters clashed with protesters in front of provincial security headquarters in Daqahliya province, an official said. Dr. Khaled Khatib, head of emergency care units in the province, told state-run EgyNews Agency that the injured were taken to hospitals in Mansoura, 120 kilometers (about 75 miles) north of Cairo. The clashes included conservative Muslims and opponents from the Tamarod -- or ""Rebellion"" -- campaign, as well as members of leftist parties in Mansoura. The city is a stronghold of the Muslim Brotherhood, in which Morsy once played a leadership role. Stores and cars were damaged in the clashes. Security forces fired tear gas to disperse the groups. In the Egyptian Suez Canal city of Port Said, the army reinforced its presence on Wednesday, three days ahead of planned anti-government protests, the state-run Ahram Online news agency reported. The army has been deployed to key locations in the port city since January, when riots erupted after 21 people were sentenced to death in the Port Said football killings. Morsy announced a state of emergency for the region. Armored vehicles toured the city's streets on Wednesday afternoon, before parking in front of the governorate headquarters. Residents cheered the forces' presence. Egypt is bracing for anti-government protests on Sunday, called for by members of the ""Rebel"" group, who seek to hold snap elections. The campaign, which has gathered 15 million endorsements, accuses the president of ""failing to implement policies to improve the life of ordinary people,"" citing Egypt's increasingly dire economic situation. Some Egyptians are calling for the army -- which was in charge of the country for an interim period following the 25 January revolution -- to take over power for a temporary period and appoint a new government, in the event that Morsy resigns. Morsy was elected in June 2012 after narrowly beating contender and Mubarak regime figure Ahmed Shafiq. ""Since the arrival of (Morsy) to power, the average citizen still has the feeling that nothing has been achieved so far from the revolution goals, which were life in dignity, freedom, social justice and national independence,"" the Tamarod campaign states. ""(Morsy) was a total failure in achieving every single goal, no security has been re-established and no social security realized."" The unrest prompted the U.S. Embassy in Cairo to close to the public on Sunday, which is normally a work day in Egypt. The Egyptian military has said it would intervene if Morsy's Salafi supporters carry out their threats to break up the protests by force. Salafis are hard-line Islamists who have called for Sharia law to be adopted in the country. Egypt's Mubarak wins petition but will stay detained .

"(CNN) -- Decades after the end of colonial rule, thousands of elderly Kenyans are getting compensation and an apology from Britain for years of torture during the fight for independence. Britain announced a Â£19.9 million ($30 million) settlement Thursday for human rights violations during its colonial rule in the East African nation. ""The British government sincerely regrets that these abuses took place and that they marred Kenya's progress towards independence,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said. The victims had accused the former colonial master of a series of human rights violations, including rape, illegal detentions and castration. ""The elderly victims of torture now at last have the recognition and justice they have sought for many years,""said Martyn Day of Leigh Day, the law firm that represented the plaintiffs. ""For them, this significance of this moment cannot be overemphasized."" In addition to the payout for the 5,228 victims, the UK said it plans to fund the construction of a memorial in Kenya to honor the freedom fighters. ""This is part of a process of reconciliation,"" Hague said. He denied that the settlement could potentially open the floodgates for colonial-era claims from other former British colonies. Plaintiffs provided evidence of torture, and the amount of payout will be based on the scale, according to Donald Rabala, another attorney representing some of the fighters. The abuse occurred between 1952 and 1961, when fighters from the Mau Mau movement battled British forces for land and freedom. Colonial forces killed thousands of fighters and detained others, including Kenyans who were not part of the rebel group. Kenya went on to gain independence from Britain in 1963. Secret files . Day said the ""long, hard struggle for justice"" took four years. The Mau Mau veterans' claims, issued in 2009, faced resistance from Britain, which said the statute of limitations had expired. The veterans filed a lawsuit, but the British government asked the judge to throw out the case, saying it transferred all liability to Kenya when the country gained independence. Kenya rebuffed the blame and stood behind the victims. In January 2011, Britain found secret documents detailing the torture, which provided a big break for the case, Day said. Britain kept immaculate records that revealed systemic human rights violations, including graphic accounts of prisoner abuse, he said. The Foreign Office was ordered to produce all evidence relevant to the Kenya case, including hundreds of boxes of files, secretly smuggled out of Kenya ahead of independence. Court paves way for lawsuit . After the revelation of the secret files, a court ruled that there was enough evidence to proceed to trial. Last year, the London high court ruled that three Kenyans tortured during the colonial rebellion could sue the United Kingdom for compensation. Thousands of others followed suit. The three men who filed the original case made numerous trips to London to give their testimony. They are among the group that will be compensated. After the ruling last year, thousands of miles away in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, jubilant colonial-era fighters, balancing on canes, gingerly danced. Others prayed and wept. ""It's a great day. I am as happy as the day I was released"" from the detention camp, said Wambugu Wa Nyingi, one of the three original plaintiffs. Who are the Mau Mau? The Mau Mau insurgency was made up of Kenya's largest tribe, the Kikuyu. Its members were against British domination and fought colonial forces for years. During the uprising, as many as 150,000 Kenyans were incarcerated in what was then British East Africa, accused of joining resistance movements started by marginalized tribes. Among them were many civilians, including U.S. President Barack Obama's grandfather. Obama referred to his grandfather's incarceration in his memoir ""Dreams from My Father,"" writing that he was held for six months by the British, but found innocent.

"(CNN) -- Col. Kevin Brown stood tall and proud and often ventured ""outside the wire"" with his soldiers in Baghdad. Under the sizzle of the Iraqi sun, I watched him meticulously pin medals on their uniforms. When he retired in 2011, he walked the Appalachian Trail to clear his head and began a tough Ph.D. program in security studies at Kansas State University. A stellar military career in hand, Brown had his life on track. Except for one thing. He harbored an emptiness within, the kind that rushes in after a hard-fought, 15-month combat tour ends. He felt responsible, still, for the lives he touched at war. One of them was a girl named Noor al-Zahra Haider. He'd wondered all these years what had happened to the child his soldiers helped save. He sought out people who might have an answer -- Army buddies, journalists and an Iraqi sheikh he'd befriended in the neighborhood where Noor used to live. But no one knew. He finally connected with her Wednesday through a package from America. The goods were donated, but they were delivered to Noor's home in Baghdad largely because of Brown's efforts. Viewers write in to help Iraq's 'miracle baby' For Noor, crippled by spina bifida, it's a gift that is sure to bring relief. She received a new wheelchair and other things to help her cope with her disability. For Brown, it means fulfillment, closure -- if there is such a thing -- to one part of his life at war. Since his encounter with Noor almost seven years ago, Brown's uneasiness had festered. Then in March, on the 10th anniversary of the start of the Iraq War, Brown saw a CNN story about Noor. I had journeyed back to Baghdad to find her. He watched the accompanying video, incredulous that the 3-month-old baby he knew was now 7 years old. He was relieved, excited even, that she was alive. He cried. He laughed. He could not get the headline -- ""The Unfinished Miracle of Baby Noor"" -- out of his head. The word ""unfinished"" gnawed at his soul; that sense of responsibility hung heavy. ""I hope that you might consider keeping me informed of anything you learn from here forward,"" Brown told me in a message after finding me on Facebook. ""It would help me help my soldiers keep knowing that if they did any one thing right in Iraq, it was saving a little girl's life. ""I personally struggle with what I can do as an individual and will offer my services -- as a champion, with money, as a connector -- in any way within my means."" I was embedded with Brown's soldiers when they discovered Noor, then only 3 months old, during a raid on her family's house in the city of Abu Ghraib a few days before Christmas 2005. She'd been born with a severe form of spina bifida, a spinal cord defect that was certain to kill her. The medical treatment she needed was not available in war-ravaged Iraq. The soldiers wanted to shuttle her out of Baghdad for the critical care she needed. When I spoke with Brown a few days ago, he recalled how he had stood at brigade headquarters at Camp Liberty and made his case for why the U.S. Army should help send an Iraqi baby to America. Iraq, 10 years later: A people in need . One child matters, he said. He spoke on behalf of his soldiers. They saw Noor as a tangible act of goodness amid the chaos of Iraq. Brown was persuasive. Noor boarded a C-130 transport plane with her grandmother and father and came to Atlanta, where doctors successfully operated on her. She became known to the world as Baby Noor. Her smile enthralled everyone who saw her on television screens and newspaper pages. She was labeled Iraq's miracle baby. After six months, in June 2006, she was returned to Baghdad, where life is not easy for anyone and even less so for a poor family caring for a child with special needs. Surgery saved her life, but Noor was paralyzed from the waist down. She couldn't walk or go to the bathroom by herself. Doctors said it would always be that way. Her family also paid a price for their association with Americans -- Noor's father says he was abducted by men linked to al Qaeda. They accused him of spying and demanded a stiff ransom. I'd not seen Noor since 2008. In February, I returned to Baghdad to find her. She was no longer the smiling, chubby baby I remembered. She'd grown into a frail girl who rarely smiled. Sadness blanketed her face. Her family feared for her future. They did not have the means to have her examined by specialists. They were running out of medical supplies such as catheters. Noor was susceptible to urinary tract infections and often complained of headaches -- doctors had inserted a shunt to drain the fluid that collected in her brain. What would happen to her as she grew older? No one would marry a disabled woman in Iraq, her aunts said. Noor's grandfather begged for help. She might have had a semblance of a normal life here in the United States, where she could have had access to advanced urological care and the comforts of life. But in Baghdad, long after the Americans left Iraq, Noor was struggling to survive, to even feel joy. Readers responded to Noor's story and sent in donations to Childspring International, an Atlanta-based Christian charity that sponsored Noor's stay in the United States in 2006. With some of the money, Childspring purchased a two-year supply of catheters, laxatives, books, crayons, pencils, teddy bears, toothpaste and a pediatric wheelchair with gel pads, foot rests and adjustable handles. For Noor, it would be like upgrading to a BMW after years of driving a rundown Chevy. Iraq newsmakers: Where are they now? But the organization had no contacts in Baghdad. How would it get all the stuff there? That's when Brown stepped in. As a retired Army officer, he had connections with people in the U.S. Embassy. Within days USAID's Iraq Access to Justice Program and the Iraqi Alliance of Disabilities Organizations were involved. CNN staffers, who knew where Noor lived, helped take the shipment Wednesday to the family home in southwest Baghdad. Noor's grandfather, Khalaf Abbas, was thankful for the wheelchair and supplies. Among those he named was ""Mr. Brown."" In the context of Iraq, the gift for Noor is not big. It is but a blip in a story of war that is overflowing with sorrow and loss. But for Noor's family, it was a sign that those who had given her a chance at life had not forgotten her. ""We know now that you are not going to leave us,"" Abbas said. No one ever doubted that saving Noor's life was a good thing. But was there any thought put into what would happen afterward to her and the family? Should she have been brought to America and then returned to a place like Iraq, where medical care was next to nothing and where her family paid a price for accepting help from Americans? I asked Brown the same question I had asked his soldiers who were involved with Noor's journey to America. ""Was it the right thing to do?"" ""Unequivocally, yes,"" he replied. He and his soldiers didn't just save a life that day. They'd saved a life that continued. ""You know that scene in 'Saving Private Ryan' that is cut across the beginning and the end of the movie?"" Brown asked me a few days ago on the phone. I know the one, I tell him. It's the scene when an aging Ryan kneels down at the grave of his captain, who he'd served alongside in the thick of battle. Before he died, the captain had said to Ryan: ""Earn this."" Reflecting on those words and the price that was paid for having saved his life, Ryan turns to his wife of many decades and asks: ""Am I a good man?"" It's a scene that gets Brown every time. ""I think we all want to be told that we were 'good men,' despite our personal flaws, foibles, failures, missteps and the overall funk of what that conflict in Iraq felt like, looked like and came across like to both us and the citizens back home,"" Brown told me. ""Perhaps the Noor story shines that light on a time when we were good men and earned our nation's respect whether they were looking or not ... whether they knew it or not, and it gives us some comfort amongst the shades of gray we experienced there."" For Brown and his soldiers who plucked Noor from her home all those years ago, the gift delivered this week represented a lingering desire to do something right in the end.

"(CNN) -- Former South African leader Nelson Mandela was ""responding better to treatment"" on Wednesday, President Jacob Zuma told the country's Parliament. Mandela, 94, has been in serious but stable condition since being rushed to a Pretoria hospital with a recurring lung infection, the president's office has said. On Wednesday, Zuma signaled some optimism. ""I am happy to report that Madiba is responding better to treatment from this morning,"" Zuma told Parliament ahead of a budget address, using the clan name by which Mandela is widely referred to in South Africa. ""We are very happy with the progress that he is now making, following a difficult last few days. ""We appreciate the messages of support from all over the world. ... We urge South Africans and the international community to continue to keep President Mandela and the medical team in their thoughts and prayers."" Family members also visited Mandela in the hospital Wednesday. In a written statement, Mandela's grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile Mandela said they had been touched and heartened by the outpouring of public prayers and good will during ""a difficult period for the Mandela family."" ""We are fully cognizant of the fact that millions of people in the country and around the world regard Madiba as their parent and therefore are as much concerned about his well-being as we are,"" he said. The family is satisfied with the care Mandela is receiving and shares everyone's hope for his recovery, he said. The grandson also thanked the doctors, government and ruling African National Congress for their support. As Mandela lay in the hospital, children left hand-drawn ""get well"" cards and message outside his Johannesburg home, reflecting the affection with which the nation regards its former president. History of lung problems . Earlier Wednesday, government spokesman Mac Maharaj told SAFM radio that the anti-apartheid icon's condition remained serious but stable and little changed from Tuesday. Over the weekend, the president's office said Mandela was breathing on his own and his wife was by his side. Mandela's daughter Zenani Dlamini, the South African ambassador to Argentina, flew back to South Africa to be with her father. Zuma visited Mandela late Monday and said he was satisfied with the medical care Mandela was receiving. Mandela's former wife, Winnie, an African National Congress lawmaker, also visited him Monday. Mandela has been in and out of hospitals in recent years. Each episode has sparked renewed concerns. His history of lung problems dates to when he was a political prisoner on Robben Island during the apartheid era, and he has battled respiratory infections over the years. He has not appeared in public since South Africa hosted the World Cup in 2010. Last year, he spent the Christmas holidays undergoing treatment for a lung infection and gallstones, one of his longest hospital stays since his release from prison in 1990.

"(CNN) -- Egyptians disillusioned with their president began protests demanding he step down on the one-year anniversary of his swearing-in ceremony. Less than a week later, Mohamed Morsy was removed from power with the help of the military, putting Egypt on course for more pain. Morsy still has support and his Muslim Brotherhood group is likely to still have an important role in Egypt's future. Even prominent reform figures say the Brotherhood should be part of Egypt's future. But the fallout from Morsy's removal will be felt across the region, and Jane Kinninmont warned that some of the nations that cheered Morsy's downfall may change their view if it sparks people-power protests at home. Morsy was elected president of Egypt in 2012 but went on to push a pro-Islamist agenda that angered opposition liberals, Frida Ghitis said. Mohammed Ayoob, writing on CNN.com, argued Morsy's greatest mistakes were too much -- not too little -- accommodation of political opponents and not reining in the military's autonomy. He says some disillusioned Islamists will now likely resort to arms. Before the protests began, CNN contributor Cynthia Schneider warned of the coming second revolution. Millions took part calling for an end to Morsy's presidency countered by smaller -- but still large -- pro-Morsy rallies. Morsy was given two deadlines on Monday. The opposition gave him 24 hours to quit; the military gave him 48 hours to ""meet the demands of the people."" CNN's Ben Wedeman pointed out it's hard to rule Egypt without the support of the military. And come the military's Wednesday deadline, Morsy disappeared from view -- though he was still tweeting -- as his opponents camped out in Tahrir Square until a general announced on TV that Morsy was no longer in power. Huge cheers rang across the square. iReporters in Egypt explained their joy for the moment and their hopes for the future. The Muslim Brotherhood railed against the military's involvement in ousting Morsy and demanded its supporters take to the streets. Isobel Coleman, a senior fellow for U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Egyptians will now have to choose between secular or Islamic rule -- and that the decision will echo far beyond Egypt's borders. In the immediate aftermath, world leaders from Iran to the United States reacted to events in Egypt and brushed up on their knowledge of the world's newest leader, interim President Adly Mansour, who until Wednesday -- when the military suspended the constitution -- was head of the Supreme Constitutional Court.","Mohamed Morsy started the week as president; ends it in custody .

Austin Tice, who was working as a freelancer for McClatchy and other news outlets, last contacted his family on August 13 while in Syria reporting on the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's government. He was preparing to leave Syria for neighboring Lebanon when he went missing, according to his family. ""It's more to seek out people who can help facilitate his release,"" a family spokesperson told CNN. ""(His parents) will be giving a few interviews, but the focus is on making themselves available to those who can help. 'Help' in the sense of intervening directly with his captors.""

He had smuggled himself into the country to report on the uprising. In November, Marc Tice, Austin Tice's father, told reporters that the Syrian government had told his family that it doesn't know where their son is. In October, a shaky video surfaced on YouTube showing a man believed to be Tice surrounded by armed men walking him up a hill. State Department officials have questioned the veracity of the video, which purports to show Tice in the custody of rebels fighting the Syrian government.

"New York (CNN) -- A judge ruled Thursday that the World Trade Center's developers cannot collect billions in damages from companies whose planes were commandeered in the September 11 terrorist attacks. World Trade Center Properties, or WTCP, first sued United Airlines, American Airlines and other aviation companies in 2004, claiming their negligence resulted in the 9/11 terrorist attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center towers. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein agreed with the airlines, who argued the developers were in essence trying to ""double dip"" by getting money from the airlines after collecting from their insurance policies. Last month, Hellerstein -- who frequently hears cases related to 9/11-- denied a motion by the airlines to have the case dismissed based on the $4.9 billion in insurance payouts to WTCP since 2001. According to a complaint filed on behalf of WTCP, owned by Larry Silverstein, the September 11 attacks were the result of the airlines' failures to implement safeguards that would have prevented the terrorist attacks. In the complaint, WTCP claimed that the aircraft lacked proper cockpit doors that would have prevented unauthorized people from entering, as well as an alarm system that would have notified the government of such events. American Airlines Flight 11 was the first jet to slam into the World Trade Center. Hijackers flew United Airlines Flight 175 into the other tower. The lawsuit also named private security contractors at Boston's Logan Airport and the Portland, Maine, airport as defendants for failing to prevent people from boarding flights with dangerous weapons at their screening facilities. The hijackers of the planes that hit the twin towers boarded at those airports. ""Every step of the way, defendants were negligent and reckless,"" the complaint stated, ""These breaches of duty proximately caused the destruction of One World Trade Center, Five World Trade Center and Seven World Trade Center on September 11. "" According to court documents, WTCP said it has spent more than $8 billion to replace the twin towers, which they have been obligated to continue paying rent on to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. In court, the aviation defendants argued that insurance payments were made to compensate WTCP for economic loss after the destruction of the towers and that the same economic loss is what the WTCP was seeking damages for, thereby making their claims invalid. Silverstein's company had said that it would use proceeds from a ruling in its favor to build 2 World Trade Center, next to the current Freedom Tower.","The judge says the World Trade Center developers were trying to ""double dip""

"New York (CNN) -- Twenty-two years after a gruesome and heartbreaking discovery, the New York Police Department continues to search for leads on a cold case. On July 23, 1991, the body of an unidentified little girl --named ""Baby Hope"" by detectives -- was found in a blue and white picnic cooler in a wooded area near the Henry Hudson Parkway in New York City. The girl, believed to be 3 to 5 years old, was smothered and sexually molested. Her body was so badly decomposed that several sketches were made to suggest what she looked like. Police could not track down anyone who might have known the girl. She was never reported missing. On Tuesday, the anniversary of the discovery, authorities went to a neighborhood near where the body was found in hopes of finding new leads. They handed out flyers in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, ""making an amplified request for anyone with information in regards to this incident"" to come forward, according to a NYPD press release. ""Several detectives are still on this case,"" Detective Robert Dewhurst told CNN Tuesday, ""we're trying to solicit the public for new information. Maybe someone can provide identification."" People with information may speak many years later for many reasons, such as feeling safer after moving to a new area where they don't see the person responsible every day. Sometimes people ""want to get it off their chest,"" said Dewhurst, who is part of the Cold Case Apprehension Squad. For months after Baby Hope's body was found, police went back to the site hoping whoever was responsible, driven by guilt, had left some type of memorial that would have helped police. Two years after she was found murdered, Baby Hope was laid to rest in a donated plot, thanks mainly to detectives who worked on the case. She was buried in a white dress bought by a detective's wife. Despite the years this case has remained opened, Dewhurst said he is not frustrated. ""This is what my squad does,"" he said. ""Twenty years is not uncommon for a cold case. ""I have hope. Otherwise I wouldn't be doing this."" Anyone with information can call the NYPD tip line at 1-800-577-8477. Read more: When a child goes missing, there is no playbook .

"(CNN) -- The sexual battery charge against an Air Force officer who had headed a military unit aimed at preventing sexual assaults was changed to assault and battery, his lawyer said Thursday. Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, a 1994 graduate of the Air Force Academy who served tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, was arrested in May for allegedly grabbing a woman's buttocks and breasts in a parking lot in Arlington County, Virginia, near the Pentagon. A police report said the unidentified woman fought off her assailant, who appeared intoxicated. Speaking to media outside the Arlington County Courthouse Thursday, Krusinski's attorney, Barry Coburn, pointed out that that while both charges are still categorized as misdemeanor charges, the change is quite significant. ""The other offense is not a sex offense and my own sense of this is the reason this matter became newsworthy in the first instance was given Col. Krusinski's job responsibilities (and) he was initially charged with a sex offense,"" he said. After taking the position with the sexual assault prevention unit in February, Krusinski underwent training aimed at preparing him for his duties, Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. John Dorrian told CNN in May. Dorrian said Krusinski's record was ""exemplary"" and contained nothing that would have precluded him from serving with the unit. Krusinski served in Iraq from November 2009 to May 2010 and in Afghanistan from August 2011 to February 2012, earning five non-combat medals during 19 years of service. In a written statement Coburn distributed to media outside the courthouse, he expressed appreciation to prosecutors for their ""care and diligence"" used in this matter. ""Charging decisions such as this one must be based on the facts and the law of each individual case, not on politics or the desire to have a 'teachable moment' concerning issues such as sexual abuse in the military,"" Coburn said. An alarming spike in sexual assault cases in the armed forces has brought the issue front and center, prompting both President Barack Obama and top military brass to vow change. The Navy and Marine Corps will begin publishing their own versions of a sex offenders list as part of an effort to crack down on sexual assaults, CNN has learned. After his appearance Thursday, Krusinski made no comments to reporters outside the courthouse. He has been removed from his job leading a branch of the Air Force's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program. Coburn said he anticipates that Krusinski will plead not guilty when the case heads to trial. CNN's Barbara Starr and Larry Shaughnessy contributed to this report.","Air Force Lt. Col.

"New York (CNN) -- Major League Baseball issued a policy Tuesday afternoon to protect players from discrimination and harassment based on their sexual orientation. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig and New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman announced the new code of conduct at an All-Star game fan celebration at New York's Javits Center. The policy aims to strengthen efforts to protect gay players. The code will be given to every Major League and Minor League player and posted in each locker room. ""The Great American pastime of baseball sends a message that no professional athlete, professional or amateur should have to sit on the sidelines or hide out of fear of being mistreated because of their sexual orientation,"" said Schneiderman. ""I commend the commissioner and Major League Baseball for leading the charge for tolerance in professional sports."" The poster defines harassment and discrimination as slurs and insults, unwelcome physical contact and pornography on bulletin boards and locker rooms. The league will also put into effect a complaint system for reporting harassment and discrimination incidents. In addition, Selig's office will organize training sessions for club and league officials and staff at industry meetings. The next meeting is scheduled for November. ""The new policy is not in response to any specific incident,"" said Andrew Friedman, deputy communications director for Schneiderman. Baseball isn't the only sport addressing the issue of discrimination. In April, Schneiderman announced an agreement to reinforce anti-discrimination policies with the National Football League to ""promote a culture of inclusion"" and help disseminate posters to all 32 teams in the league. The NFL's policy came after earlier reports that indicated at least three prospective NFL players were asked about their sexual orientation during the league's national recruitment Scouting Combine in February, according to a Schneiderman press release. According to one prospect, representatives of the NFL teams asked the athletes whether they had a girlfriend, were married or liked girls, according to the press release. The new NFL policy, implemented in April, dictates that questions during interviews and recruitment ""must not seek information concerning personal information based on a player's sexual orientation,"" according to the NFL workplace conduct poster. ""It's been an ongoing conversation with clubs and players we've met over the years to help shape our plan and policies,"" said Brian McCarthy, vice president of corporate communications for the NFL. In the past, sports leagues have handled homophobia in different ways. In 2006, MLB manager Ozzie Guillen referred to a reporter by a homophobic slur and was asked to issue an apology. In 2012, Toronto Blue Jay's short stop Yunel Escobar was suspended three games by Major League Baseball after wearing a homophobic slur on his eye black during a game. In June, Indiana Pacers player Roy Hibbert used the term ""no homo"" during a press conference. Hibbert was fined $75,000 and issued an apology via Twitter to Jason Collins, who had recently become the NBA's first openly gay athlete. Human rights organizations welcomed MLB's move and its possible future impact. ""What we have been seeing is a greater move towards acceptance on the basis of sexual orientation, and we have seen the MLB showing leadership in this area,"" said Michael Cole-Schwartz, director of media relations for the Human Rights Campaign. Changes in policy may be difficult to implement at first, especially for athletic organizations, but Cole-Schwartz believes that these changes will show benefit over time. ""It says to gay fans and any players that might be gay but not out yet that the league is taking their concerns seriously and that it is a safe environment in which to enjoy and play the sport,"" said Cole-Schwartz.","Major League Baseball has new code of conduct .
It seeks end to discrimination over sexual orientation .

"(CNN) -- A University of Connecticut professor is under investigation for alleged sexual misconduct and child molestation dating back decades and involving several men, authorities say. In a search warrant request issued in June, five men accuse Robert Miller, 66, a professor in UConn's music department who's been on the faculty since 1982, of sexually abusing them when they were between the ages of 10 and 13. Miller is on paid administrative leave, though no charges have been filed. ""Allegations involving crimes against children are both profoundly disturbing and heartbreaking,"" UConn President Susan Herbst said in a statement posted on the university's website. ""Although these allegations, which have been made public, appear to be unrelated to UConn, the university continues to do all it can to assist law enforcement."" In the warrant request, the men say Miller abused four of them at his home in 1992, when he worked as a camp counselor, and one of them in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when Miller was a teacher in Fairfax County, Virginia. The request was filed in Rockville Superior Court. Miller's UConn faculty profile says he was the director of volunteer programs for the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp in Ashford, Connecticut, from 1989 to 1992. The camp was founded in 1988 by actor Paul Newman for children with cancer, hemophilia, HIV/AIDS and other serious illnesses, the camp's website says. The camp removed Miller from his position in 1992 when it was made aware of an incident involving the alleged victims, according to the warrant request. ""When the current investigation began several months ago, it was unclear whether the matter was reported to the appropriate authorities at that time,"" Ryan Thompson, senior development officer at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp, said in a prepared statement. ""Therefore, the Camp immediately made a report to the Connecticut Department of Children and Families and has continued to cooperate fully with authorities."" The investigation was launched earlier this year, according to the search warrant request, after UConn officials received word from one of the alleged victims that Miller was ""a pedophile."" University police notified Connecticut state police of the allegation, and the investigation was opened in March. The statute of limitations has expired for the alleged crimes committed in Connecticut, according to the search warrant request. The statute has not passed for the alleged crimes committed in Virginia, and Connecticut state police say they are seeking evidence regarding those incidents. Herbst added that the university is investigating ""unsubstantiated"" reports regarding Miller and UConn students. Miller did not answer calls at his residence or office Tuesday. Lt. Paul Vance, a Connecticut State Police spokesman, says his agency cannot comment on an open investigation.","Four men say Robert Miller abused them when he was a camp counselor in 1992 .

"New York (CNN) -- Brooklyn Nets coach and former 10-time NBA All-Star Jason Kidd pleaded guilty Tuesday to a misdemeanor drunk-driving charge stemming from a 2012 arrest, according to authorities. Kidd's plea can be reduced to a violation of ""driving while ability impaired"" if he completes his community service, according to the Suffolk County prosecutor's office. He has agreed to speak to Long Island high school students about the dangers of drunk driving. Kidd was arrested by Southampton Town police on July 15, 2012, after his SUV smashed a utility pole against several trees, according to police records. At the time of his arrest, Kidd refused a breathalyzer test and a blood test. The DWI charge was based on the arresting officer's assessment that Kidd smelled strongly of alcohol, had slurred speech, and had ""bloodshot, watery and glassy eyes,"" the Suffolk County prosecutor's office said. Kidd told police that he was on his way home from having a few drinks at a club. ""Jason has taken responsibility for his actions, and fully realizes that he needs to grow from this experience,"" Brooklyn Nets General Manager Bill King said Tuesday. ""We are confident he will make these strides on a personal level and have a positive effect on others as well."" Kidd's attorney, Eddie Burke Jr. was not immediately available for comment.

"Washington (CNN) -- ""I was totally stunned."" That's how Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tennessee, described his reaction upon finding out the woman he though was his long lost daughter, really wasn't. ""I felt confident that it was for sure that (it) would come out that I was the father,"" "" he told CNN. ""When I found out I wasn't, I was floored."" This bizarre story begins with an even more bizarre backstory. Flashback to February, President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. Washington was abuzz about what appeared to be a salacious social media blunder: during the speech -- the bachelor congressman tweeted ""I-L-U "" for 'I LOVE YOU' to an attractive young blonde. Cohen, 64, announced that aspiring model Victoria Brink was actually his daughter, something he learned from her mother, an old girlfriend he had recently contacted. ""I couldn't sleep one night and I Googled her and it came out that she had a bio written up on her webpage and it said she had a daughter Victoria. So I Facebooked, searched her daughter and it turns out she had this daughter born on the 22nd of April in '88 and that was kind of when we were together,"" said Cohen. Cohen says his old flame told him that her daughter looked like him. ""So that is what it was, and I wrote Victoria a letter and she wrote me back and she said, 'This is very difficult for me. All my life I thought somebody else was my father.'"" CNN intended to do a story about a congressman finding his daughter late in life. But during the process, Victoria and the man she'd always thought was her father, wanted to do paternity tests to be sure. The result was a stunner. Texas oilman John Brink, the man who raised her, was actually her biological father, not the congressman. Cohen said he only took a DNA test because Victoria wanted it. ""She said that she didn't know who her biological father was, and for her mental health she needed it. I had avoided it but I would do anything for her,"" said Cohen. Despite the letdown of learning Victoria is not his biological daughter, Cohen says he enjoyed introducing her as his daughter at Washington events, like the White House Christmas party. He still keeps pictures of her on his walls at the office, and at home. For him the short three-year period he thought Victoria was his daughter was enough to cement his love for her. ""We still communicate. I still care about her greatly and I think she cares about me and I hope and plan to continue to have a relationship. I think of her still as my daughter,"" he said.","Congressman thought woman was his daughter .

"Washington (CNN) -- When Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed some of the country's toughest abortion restrictions into law on Thursday, his state joined a growing number of those strategically pushing the limits of federal abortion rights that have been in place for 40 years. ""In signing House Bill 2 today, we ... cement the culture of life, which Texas is built upon,"" Perry said during the signing ceremony. ""Children do deserve the respect of simple recognition before their lives are cut tragically short."" His reference to the ""culture of life"" was no coincidence. Nor was the bill becoming law. Perry signs abortion bill into law . As the nation focused on a Republican takeover of the U.S. House during the 2010 midterm elections, an even bigger conservative revolution was taking place in the states: one that, three years later, is having big implications for state legislative battles over reproductive rights. In 2010, the GOP gained the majority of governorships, and one-fifth of the nation's state legislatures switched to complete Republican control, according to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures. Before the 2010 election, 14 state legislatures were Republican-controlled. After those elections, the GOP controlled 24 statehouses, according to the data. The partisan shift took place in such states as North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin, some of the very states that have since pushed some of the nation's most stringent abortion regulations. In Texas, Perry won re-election, and Republicans made major gains in the statehouse, which netted that party full control of state government. While most of the candidates ran on conservative economic rather than social platforms, such views tend to be part of ""part of the candidate's profile,"" said Mary Spaulding Balch, director of the department of state legislation for the National Right to Life organization. In the states, there has been a trend of gaining ""support in the elections where they are electing pro-life legislators, and the legislation is passing by a greater margin,"" she said. Those gains were coupled with a concerted effort by anti-abortion groups -- which since the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision had been stymied at the federal level -- to turn to the state level to push and pass legislation favorable to their cause, said Elizabeth Nash, state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. ""It was this perfect storm to enact abortion restrictions,"" Nash said. New laws flout -- or use -- Roe v. Wade provisions in restricting abortions . The effects are being felt across the country. In Texas, the new law bans abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, mandates that abortion clinics become ambulatory surgical centers, tightens usage guidelines for the drug RU486 and requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing such services. As it wended its way through the statehouse, the measure resulted in a high-profile showdown, and Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis undertook an 11-hour filibuster to try to block its passage. In North Carolina, the House of Representatives passed a measure placing requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business. Among the requirements is the presence of a doctor when an abortion is being performed. The bill allows North Carolina's health department to make temporary new rules for the state's 31 abortion clinics as it sees fit and prohibits government-administered insurance plans, such as those under the Affordable Care Act, to pay for abortions -- though it makes exceptions when a pregnancy endangers a woman's life. Ohio's Republican governor, John Kasich, recently signed into law a state budget that includes measures that will require ultrasounds for anyone seeking an abortion and limit abortion clinics from transferring patients to public hospitals. If they need more care after a procedure, patients will now have to seek out a private hospital. The budget will also make it more difficult for family planning groups in the Buckeye State to obtain funding for preventive care. And it puts Planned Parenthood behind clinics that don't provide abortions when it comes to obtaining state funding. In Wisconsin, a federal judge recently granted a temporary restraining order preventing the state from enforcing a new law banning doctors from performing abortions if they don't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 miles of their practice. Ultimately, anti-abortion advocates hope that some of the recently passed state legislation will force the Supreme Court to revisit issues addressed in Roe v. Wade. ""I think that's what they're angling for ... getting the Supreme Court to reconsider it,"" said Michele Swers, a Georgetown University American government professor. Anti-abortion groups acknowledge as much and point to such issues as the medically controversial language in several state bills stating that a fetus feels pain after 20 weeks. Courts in several states have blocked measures containing this language. ""If the laws were challenged and made its way to the court, we would argue the court has never looked at these issues before,"" Spaulding Balch said.

"Cairo (CNN) -- Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei has not been named Egypt's prime minister, but is ""the logical choice,"" the interim president's spokesman said Saturday, contradicting statements earlier in the day by officials in ElBaradei's political party. The move comes as anger grows among supporters of deposed President Mohamed Morsy -- including the Muslim Brotherhood -- who have decried the military's move to push him from power, and raised fears of widening violence. ElBaradei met with interim President Adly Mansour for two hours Saturday afternoon, and ""discussions and consultations are ongoing,"" presidential adviser Ahmed al-Muslimani said on state-run TV. ""Tomorrow we expect to name the prime minister and the ministers."" If ElBaradei is selected, it would signal a secular shift just days after a military coup ousted the nation's first democratically elected -- and Islamist -- president. The country stands divided between those who support the return to power of Morsy and those who applaud the military takeover and accuse Morsy's government of having edged toward an Islamist and autocratic rule. Each side accuses the other of thwarting democracy. And on Saturday, each side was trying to present a unified front, as violence between Morsy's supporters and his opponents and the military swept across the country, leaving at least 30 dead and more than 1,400 wounded, according to state-run media. The possible appointment of ElBaradei, the defacto head of the opposition movement in the days leading to Wednesday's ouster of Morsy, has been discussed as a possibility among supporters in recent days. ElBaradei, the former head of the U.N's nuclear watchdog agency, ran in the country's first election in 2012 but withdrew after criticizing the interim government for failing to bring about a ""real democratic system."" How Morsy's supporters, who supported the deposed Islamist president's rule, react to the new government will be key for post-coup Egypt, where the military suspended the country's constitution and dissolved parliament. ElBaradei: Morsy's ouster was needed so Egypt cannot 'fail' In an interview with CNN on Thursday, ElBaradei called Morsy's ouster a ""reset"" of the 2011 popular revolution that toppled Hosni Mubarak. ""Either we risk a civil war or ... take extra constitutional measures to ensure that we keep the country together,"" he said, explaining the military's conundrum. ""This is a recall, and it is nothing novel."" Outside the Republican Guard headquarters, where four pro-Morsy protesters died Friday in clashes with military forces loyal to the fledgling government, a funeral march was held Saturday. And pro-Morsy demonstrations continued around the Rabaa Al-Adawiya Mosque. The Egyptian Armed Forces, responding to ""rumors and lies,"" said on its Facebook page that there was no division among its ranks over its decision to back ""the demands of the Egyptian people"" over the government. ""These rumors are completely and utterly untrue,"" it said. Those supporting Morsy's return to power turned out en masse in squares around the country on Friday -- dubbed a ""day of rejection"" by the Muslim Brotherhood -- in demonstrations marked by sporadic violence between supporters of Morsy and his opponents and security forces. Thirty-five people were killed and 1,404 others injured since Friday across the nation, according to state TV which cited health ministry sources. Opinion: Will the Muslim Brotherhood survive? On Saturday, the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, rejected the call for national dialogue from the newly installed interim president, Adly Mansour. ""The party reiterated its stance that it does not recognize the military coup and that the legitimate president of Egypt is Mohamed Morsy,"" said Hussein Ibrahim Amin, the secretary-general of the party, in a statement, according to state-run EgyNews. Crowds of Morsy supporters converged for a second consecutive day Saturday outside the Republican Guard complex, where Morsy was reportedly being held, according to a tweet from the party. ""Steadfast Iron, Iron, president,"" the crowds were said to be chanting. ""Behind you a million-man martyr."" The complex had been the site Friday of at least four killings that occurred when demonstrators charged the military, the health ministry said. Soldiers used live ammunition, the Freedom and Justice Party said. Security forces, on state television, denied the assertion. Egypt: Fast Facts . The ""second revolution"" Wednesday's coup was the culmination of weeks of efforts by Morsy's opponents to push him out. They said 22 million people had signed petitions calling for him to step down -- more than had voted for him in the 2012 election -- and followed up with days of protests that attracted massive crowds. Morsy's supporters countered with rallies in favor of his government. At times, bloody clashes ensued. Dozens were killed. On Monday, the military issued a 48-hour ultimatum demanding that Morsy form a power-sharing government with his opponents. The end of Morsy's rule came on Wednesday, when his conciliatory gestures failed to placate the military. Opinion: How Egypt's military holds key to country's future . Egypt's experience with democratic governance was short for a country whose history can be measured in millennia. ""Either we risk a civil war or ... take extra constitutional measures to ensure that we keep the country together,"" he said, explaining the military's conundrum. ""This is a recall, and it is nothing novel."" But Morsy failed to fix the nation's ailing economy or stop spiraling crime, both of which worsened during his tenure. He was seen by many as increasingly autocratic. Human Rights Watch has said he had perpetuated abusive practices that Mubarak had established, molding them to his own purposes and adding to them. These included the trial of civilians by military courts, the permitting of police brutality and the suppression of critical voices. Adly Mansour, head of the country's Supreme Constitutional Court, was sworn in Thursday as interim president. He dissolved Egypt's upper house of parliament, the Shura Council, and appointed a new head of intelligence, state TV said Friday. Profile: Who is Adly Mansour? The new government moved quickly to arrest leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood and was following up on hundreds more warrants. Some taken into custody have since been released, state television reported. The Egyptian army has promised a path to new elections. Wearing his trademark sunglasses, the 85-year-old Mubarak appeared Saturday in the fourth session of his retrial over his alleged involvement in the killing of protesters during his ouster. His appeal of last year's guilty verdict began in May, but was postponed on Saturday to August 17. Egypt is pivotal . In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman on Friday condemned the violence following Morsy's ouster and called on the military to respect the will of the people, but did not call for Morsy's reinstatement. ""The voices of all who are protesting peacefully must be heard -- including those who welcomed the events of earlier this week and those who supported President Morsy,"" spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said. ""The Egyptian people must come together to resolve their differences peacefully, without recourse to violence or the use of force."" U.S. President Barack Obama was spending the weekend at Camp David; Secretary of State John Kerry was vacationing in Nantucket. But U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, called Friday for the suspension of U.S. aid to Egypt's military, which exceeds $1 billion per year. ""We cannot repeat the same mistakes that we made at other times in our history by supporting the removal of freely elected governments,"" the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services told CNN affiliate KNXV. Once the military sets a timetable for elections and a new constitution, ""then we should evaluate whether to continue the aid,"" he said. Why Americans should care about Egypt . Egypt is the most populous Arab country in the world and has long been a close ally of the United States, which supported it with military aid even during Mubarak's 30-year dictatorship. It controls the Suez Canal, a crucial sea route through which more than 4% of the world's oil and 8% of its seaborne trade travel. With Jordan, it is one of two Arab countries that have signed peace treaties with Israel. Opinion: Cut off aid to Egypt till elections held .

"Washington (CNN) -- It's hard to imagine the atmosphere in Congress getting any more toxic, but it could if Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid carries out his threat to use the ""nuclear option"" to budge stalled presidential appointees forward. A top Republican aide warns that important bills like the recently approved immigration measure would never pass in a post-nuclear Senate. ""If they blow the place up, then anything requiring a big bipartisan push like immigration will be impossible,"" the GOP aide said. Democrats step closer to ""nuclear option"" in filibuster fight . Republicans will protest by slamming the brakes on action in the Senate, current and former senior Senate aides from both parties predicted to CNN. The poisoned atmosphere could stall passage of several important items moving through Congress like tax reform, judicial nominations, government spending bills and a debt ceiling increase. Even a relatively modest rewrite of student loan laws could be in jeopardy, meaning students headed to school this fall would have to pay higher interest rates. 5 political stories to watch this week . Democrats control the Senate but don't have the 60 votes necessary to break a filibuster. Reid warned Republicans if they don't drop filibusters against Obama's Cabinet and agency picks, he will take the drastic step of changing Senate rules without Republican consent. The change would prevent filibusters of executive branch nominations, allowing them to be confirmed on a simple majority vote. A last-ditch effort to head off the crisis will come Monday night, when all senators are scheduled to attend a closed session that Republicans requested in the historic Old Senate chamber. 'Bipartisan cooperation will come to a grinding halt' ""A likely result of Reid triggering the nuclear option will be an erosion in the comity that makes the Senate the unique institution that it always has been,"" one senior Republican staffer told CNN. ""It is very likely that bipartisan cooperation will come to a grinding halt."" A top Democratic aide said, ""The immediate aftermath will be messy. The GOP will shut down the Senate and they will keep it locked down until there are tangible impacts from inaction. Only then, when people start to realize that their lawmakers are not working on the farm bill, immigration, budget and other issues, will they pick up the phone and call their lawmakers."" Jim Manley, a former top aide to Reid, said Republicans have a number of options to slow things down. ""I'm not so sure what else (Senate Republican leader) Sen. (Mitch) McConnell can do to slow down the Senate more than he already has, but I'm entirely confident he has any number of tricks up his sleeves,"" said Manley, who was with Reid in 2005 when Republicans, then in the majority, threatened to use the nuclear option to prevent filibusters against President George W. Bush's judicial nominations. ""Declining unanimous consent agreements, doubling the number of amendments they're demanding, using special procedures to try and divide bills into multiple sections. They have a number of options available to them."" Republicans wouldn't disclose exactly how they will respond but made clear they won't stand idly by. ""I think this senator summed it up nicely,"" said Don Stewart, a senior aide to McConnell, pointing to a quote from then-Sen. Barack Obama during the 2005 standoff. ""Everyone in this chamber knows that if the majority chooses to end the filibuster, if they choose to change the rules and put an end to democratic debate, then the fighting, the bitterness, and the gridlock will only get worse,"" Obama said then. Both Reid and McConnell were asked on Sunday about being on different sides of the argument in 2005. Reid said the change he is proposing is ""very minimal,"" applying only to Cabinet and executive branch positions. ""This is not judges, this is not legislation -- this has allowing the people of America to have a president who can have his team in place,"" Reid said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""This is nothing like what went on"" in 2005. Appearing later on the same program, McConnell seemed to tamp down some of the acrimony. Three days after saying Reid would be remembered as the worst Senate leader ever, McConnell said Reid was ""a reasonable man, he's a good majority leader."" Opinion: Don't say 'dysfunctional Congress' Who would come out worse if crisis not resolved? A Democratic leadership aide said Republicans have more to lose in a slowdown than Democrats do. ""The conundrum -- for Republicans, not for Democrats -- is whether they can bear shutting the Senate down over a rules change that allows simple nominations to be confirmed, and therefore also end support for popular items like immigration reform, the farm bill, and investments in education, infrastructure and health research,"" said a Democratic leadership aide. ""It may play well with their base, but the outrage is certain to fall on deaf ears with the Hispanic community, farmers, teachers, parents and students."" Two other veterans of the 2005 fight, which was resolved after a bipartisan ""Gang of 14"" senators reached a compromise, expressed hope this standoff would be resolved, too, without a change in filibuster rules. At that time, Bob Stevenson was a top aide to then-Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee. He described the threat then as an ""action-forcing mechanism"" that resulted in the creation of the ""Gang of 14."" Stevenson warned if Reid employs the nuclear option now it would ""dramatically change the very nature and culture of the Senate, spilling over into already poisonous partisan debates down the road and making resolution of those issues even more difficult."" He said he is hopeful, but not optimistic, that when senators meet Monday night, the seriousness of the potential consequences will lead to ""cooperation and compromise."" A Democratic aide, who was also at the center of the 2005 fight and who asked not to be identified, said he hopes when the senators meet privately maybe ""some of the more seasoned veterans of these battles"" will come forward and say ""'Isn't there a way to resolve this?' That's what happened in 2005."" McConnell said Sunday that he hoped an ugly fight can be avoided, as it was in 2005 when ""cooler heads prevailed."" ""We knew it would be a mistake for the long-term future of the Senate and the country. That's what I hope is going to happen here, David,"" McConnell told NBC's David Gregory. ""We have an opportunity to pull back from the brink in this meeting we're going to have of senators in the Old Senate chamber Monday night. I hope we'll come to our senses and not change the core of the Senate.""","Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid threatens to go nuclear over stalled Obama appointees .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- A Texas legislative committee approved a measure Thursday that would place broad new restrictions on abortions in the state, paving the way for the contentious legislation to become law. House Bill 2 cleared the Senate Health and Human Services Committee on a 6-3 vote. The bill will move to the full Senate floor Friday afternoon in the second attempt to pass the legislation in the Senate. The bill originally failed to pass during the previous special session because of a filibuster from Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis. Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator and presidential candidate, joined Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and Republican members of the Texas House and Senate on Thursday to voice support for the bill and disdain for Davis and those who would seek to block the legislation. At a news conference, he blamed the media for lionizing Davis and accused the senator of being out of the American mainstream. ""Look at what she was defending. She was saying that women shouldn't have sanitary conditions when receiving an abortion, she was defending that children who would otherwise be born alive shouldn't have the right to be born alive."" He went on to say, ""This is an important moment for everyone to recognize where the abortion debate really is in America."" For Santorum and other stalwarts of the anti-abortion movement, what's happening in Texas will reverberate around the country. The measure seeks to ban abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, mandate abortion clinics to become ambulatory surgical centers, tighten usage guidelines for the drug RU486 and require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing abortion services. Critics of the measure say it would shut down most abortion clinics in Texas -- denying access to many in rural communities -- and force women to seek dangerous back-alley abortions. The Republican legislators who support it say the bill isn't about banning abortions, but rather about protecting women's health. For them, it is about preventing situations like what occurred at an abortion clinic in Philadelphia, in a case in which Kermit Gosnell was sentenced to life with no parole for killing babies. However, Pastor Rick Scarborough, of Vision America, who was asked to provide opening remarks for the news conference, offered a much more succinct end goal: ""This is a small, important step toward the beginning of the end of abortion in America.""","A Texas Senate committee approves a house bill that restricts abortion .

"Washington (CNN) -- With developments in Egypt looming over his weekend trip to Camp David, President Barack Obama held a conference call with his national security team Saturday as the administration deals with what it calls ""the very fluid situation."" The meeting came on a day of growing leadership questions in Egypt, as Mohamed ElBaredei for hours was reported to be on the brink of becoming Egypt's interim prime minister, but those reports were later denied. As the administration continued its push for the Egyptian military to return a democratically-elected government, the White House said President Obama ""reiterated that the United States is not aligned with, and does not support, any particular Egyptian political party or group ... the United States categorically rejects the false claims propagated by some in Egypt that we are working with specific political parties or movements to dictate how Egypt's transition should proceed."" A statement after the meeting said Obama ""expressed concern over the continued political polarization"" and violence. The White House statement said, ""The future path of Egypt can only be determined by the Egyptian people. During this transitional period, we call on all Egyptians to come together in an inclusive process that allows for the participation of all groups and political parties. Throughout that process, the United States will continue to engage the Egyptian people in a spirit of partnership, consistent with our longstanding friendship and shared interests -- including our interest in a transition to sustainable democracy."" The Obama administration again criticized the ongoing violence and urged leaders there to condemn it. ""The United States is deeply troubled by the violence across Egypt. We strongly condemn any and all incitement to violence or attempts to divide and provoke, rather than unite, all Egyptians. The United States strongly condemns the violence by all parties and urges calm,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement Saturday evening. ""At the same time, we firmly reject the unfounded and false claims by some in Egypt that the United States supports the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood or any specific Egyptian political party or movement. The United States has always been and remains committed to the democratic process, not to any party or personality,"" Kerry's statement said. ""We want Egyptians to make their democracy work for the good of all Egyptians. At this sensitive moment, we call on all Egyptian leaders to condemn the use of force and prevent further violence among their supporters and we urge all those demonstrating to do so peacefully."" Administration officials made more calls to leaders in Egypt and in key countries the region. The State Department, in part blunting public relations issues over Kerry's working vacation in Nantucket, Massachusetts, noted in a statement that Kerry ""over the days since the unrest in Egypt intensified ... has been in constant contact with the national security team, regional partners, and his counterparts."" Kerry has been in hourly touch with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Anne Patterson, the State Department said. The State Department said Kerry's calls in the last two days included one to ElBaradei.

"Washington (CNN) -- Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down a key portion of the landmark Voting Rights Act, activists and those in states with a history of disenfranchisement at the polls are pinning their hopes on congressional action. But those hopes may be long deferred. A member of Congress who shed blood during the long march to civil rights told a Senate committee on Wednesday that he believes the Voting Rights Act ""is needed now more than ever."" ""The burden cannot be on those citizens whose rights were, or will be, violated. It is the duty of Congress to restore the life and soul to the Voting Rights Act,"" said veteran congressman John Lewis. ""The day of the Supreme Court decision broke my heart. It made me want to cry,"" the Georgia Democrat told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He spoke of facing beatings while marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, for the right to vote and his pride in receiving a pen used by President Lyndon Johnson to sign the 1965 Voting Rights Act into law. The testimony came during a week in which both Attorney General Eric Holder and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told African-American audiences that the right to vote must be safeguarded and urged congressional action in timely revision of the law. President Barack Obama has expressed that he, too, is ""deeply disappointed"" in the ruling and wrote in a statement he was ""calling on Congress to pass legislation to ensure every American has equal access to the polls."" Skepticism Congress can address voting rights ruling . But despite the heartfelt speeches, the reality is that there is little political incentive for many in Congress to act, political and legal experts say. ""House Republicans don't really have any interest in changing what the Supreme Court decided and many of the states the House Republicans come from are taking advantage of this and moving forward with voting restrictions,"" said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University historian and CNN contributor. Last month, the high court effectively invalidated a key provision of the act that gives the federal government oversight of states and localities with a history of voter discrimination. The ruling said Congress must re-determine how places are put on the list using updated data—something Chief Justice John Roberts suggested Congress should have addressed when it reauthorized the law in 2006. ""Congress could have updated the coverage formula at that time, but did not do so,"" Roberts wrote in the 5-4 majority opinion. ""Its failure leaves us today with no choice but to declare Section 4 unconstitutional. The formula in that section can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance."" 'Outrageous' or overdue?: Court strikes down part of historic voting rights law . Shortly after the Supreme Court ruling, several states with a history of voter discrimination that had previously been required to ""pre-clear"" any changes to their voting laws and district lines with federal authorities, pressed forward with controversial voter identification laws. Texas swiftly moved ahead with a hotly debated law requiring photo identification to vote and the state's attorney general also expressed confidence that new redistricting maps passed by the Republican-controlled legislature would soon be implemented. The Justice Department had blocked the state's redistricting efforts, citing them as potentially racially discriminatory. The ripple effects are being felt elsewhere as many of the 15 states — most of them in the South — that had required federal preclearance before changing voting practices began enacting new laws. In Mississippi and Alabama, that has meant proceeding with plans to require voters to present a photo ID before casting a ballot during the 2014 midterm elections. North Carolina elections officials have said they are eagerly eyeing putting in place similar laws just in time for the 2016 presidential election. Florida can set early voting times and days as it sees fit, a practice which drew criticism from some voting rights advocacy groups during the last general election amid accusations that the Republican governor and legislature were trying to disenfranchise minority voters in the swing state. And in Georgia, Republican-redrawn district lines that irk Democrats could be set. Further, Lewis and Wisconsin Rep. James Sensenbrenner, his Republican ally in the fight to recraft the Voting Rights Act, will go before a House Judiciary subcommittee on Thursday chaired by Rep. Trent Franks, R-Arizona, one of the 33 Republicans who voted against the law's 2006 reauthorization. To be sure, ""there are other provisions of the law that can protect voters,"" said Myrna Pérez, deputy director at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. There are still legal avenues to address discriminatory voting practices should they arise, she said. Advocates for a congressional solution say lawmakers could pass a new formula for determining which places need extra oversight of their voting laws. And political experts point out that should a trend of disenfranchisement occur during the next several election cycles, it could provide congressional motivation to revisit the law in a substantive way. Goodlatte unsure if Congress will take up Voting Rights Act . But House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, recently said that he doesn't know whether Congress will work to change the law so that it's considered constitutional by the justices. ""We will look at what the Supreme Court was talking about in terms of old data,"" Goodlatte said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We'll look at what new data is available and we will make sure that people's freedom to vote in elections in this country is protected."" CNN's Ashley Killough and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.","Supreme Court struck down a key part of Voting Rights Act; left it to Congress to address gap .
There's little political incentive for a Republican-controlled House to change law .
Many Southern states moving forward with voting laws some see as onerous for minorities .

"Washington (CNN) -- A former U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer in Texas was sentenced Thursday to nine years in prison in conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants into the United States. Juan Carlos Guerrero, 39, pleaded guilty to bribery and smuggling last year. His girlfriend, a nephew and two associates received lesser sentences for their roles in the scheme. Guerrero worked the midnight shift at several ports of entry, and his responsibilities included checking vehicles coming into the U.S. from Mexico. He admitted letting between 80 to 165 people illegally cross into the U.S. from January 2009 until May 2011. Guerrero and his cohorts received bribes ranging from $500 to $3,000 per person. Guerrero was placed on administrative leave after his October 2012 arrest. He resigned his job in December as part of a plea agreement. In addition to his prison sentence, Guerrero received a $30,000 fine. Customs and Border Protection issued a statement in response to the sentencing: ""We do not tolerate corruption or abuse within our ranks, and we fully cooperate with any criminal or administrative investigation of alleged misconduct by any of our personnel, on or off duty."" In fiscal year 2012, U.S. Customs and Border Protection employed 21,790 officers who processed people and cargo arriving at land, sea and airport based ports of entry. That's in addition to 21,394 Border Patrol agents who patrol the areas between the ports of entry and also operate interior highway checkpoints.

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department and Puerto Rico signed a major civil rights agreement Wednesday to reform the commonwealth's very troubled police force. The pact faces final approval by a federal judge, who will oversee its enforcement. An earlier Justice Department investigation found numerous problems in the Puerto Rico Police Department, the nation's second-largest, including: . -- Excessive use of force to suppress free speech. -- Unconstitutional stops, searches and arrests. -- A failure to investigate sexual assault and domestic violence allegations. ""Although I recognize that complete and lasting reform will not take hold overnight, I'm confident that this agreement lays out a clear path for responding to concerns, correcting troubling practices, safeguarding the rights of Puerto Rican citizens, restoring public trust, and ensuring public safety,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in remarks prepared for a news conference. According to the Justice Department, the agreement with Puerto Rico is among the most extensive agreements involving the police misconduct provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The American Civil Liberties Union welcomed the agreement on an issue it highlighted more than a year ago. ""At long last, the government of Puerto Rico will work together with the Justice Department to end the rampant police abuse that has plagued the island for so many years,"" Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement. ""We trust that this historic settlement means that Puerto Ricans will no longer have to live in fear of their own police force. A court-enforceable agreement like this ensures that the PRPD will be held accountable if it fails to overhaul its policies and practices."" An ACLU report in June 2012 disclosed evidence of widespread abuses and violations of civil rights by the 17,000-strong police department, saying the force ""has run amok for years."" The abuse was ""pervasive and systemic, island-wide and ongoing,"" the report said. The Justice Department announced in December that it reached a preliminary agreement with Puerto Rico. It delayed implementation to allow then-incoming Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla the time to review it and suggest possible changes.

"(CNN) -- It wasn't a typical day on the set of the hit game show ""Family Feud"" on Monday. Alana Thompson, the 7-year-old star of ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo,"" and her family faced off against ""Cake Boss"" Buddy Valastro and his family. The casts of the TLC reality shows put their vivacious and raw personalities to the test. Deep country accents and trash talking from both sides filled the Atlanta Civic Center, where the show was taped. Each family clearly had a competitive nature, but it was all for a good cause on Monday. The winning clan brought in $20,000 for a charity they chose before the game. The ""Here Comes Honey Boo Boo"" bunch played for Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders. The ""Cake Boss"" crew competed for the Momma Mary Foundation, a charity dedicated to creating awareness about and finding a cure for ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Comedian Steve Harvey hosted the episode. Since the premiere of ""Family Feud"" in 1976, the show has been one of television's most popular and enduring game shows. Honey Boo Boo's 13-year old sister, Lauryn ""Pumpkin"" Thompson, was starstruck. She stumbled over her words when she met Harvey, but she was able to clearly articulate ""I'm Pumpkin, and I'm a huge fan"" about five times. The ""Cake Boss"" family members ribbed Valastro several times for being such a spoiled husband -- particularly about how his mother clipped his toenails for him until he was married. Harvey picked up on this theme and kept the jokes going at Valstro's expense. Both families exhibited huge personalities. ""You better redneckognize,"" said Honey Boo Boo in an interview with CNN before the show taping began. So who won? You'll have to wait until the new season begins in September.","The casts of ""Honey Boo Boo"" and ""Cake Boss"" tape a ""Family Feud"" segment in Atlanta .

"(CNN) -- A Georgia man accused of trying to extort Paula Deen by threatening to divulge ""true and damning"" information about the embattled celebrity chef appeared in federal court Tuesday and pleaded not guilty. Thomas George Paculis, 62, was arrested on a criminal complaint by FBI agents in Ithaca, New York, earlier this month. The former Augusta and Savannah, Georgia, resident appeared before a U.S. magistrate judge in Savannah, Georgia, Tuesday morning for arraignment. The federal charges were filed on June 24 in the U.S. Southern District of Georgia. Paculis entered a plea of not guilty and was placed under $10,000 bond, according to court documents from the hearing. A federal judge in New York released Paculis on bond a day after his arrest, said Stephen Emmett with the FBI's Atlanta office. Savannah is where Deen built her business and brand into what many consider the folksy face of Southern cooking. But she's been on her heels after admitting, in a deposition related to a lawsuit brought by a former employee, that she's used the ""N-word"" in the past. Former employee Lisa Jackson alleged that Deen and her brother Bubba Hier committed numerous acts of violence, discrimination and racism that resulted in the end of her five-year employment at The Lady and Sons, and Uncle Bubba's Oyster House, two Savannah restaurants run by Deen and her family. Deen's accuser: 'This has never been about the N-word' In the media firestorm that followed, Deen lost at least nine lucrative endorsements and her Food Network cooking show, while the publication of her eagerly anticipated cookbook was canceled. According to a criminal complaint, Paculis interjected himself on June 24, five days after details of Deen's deposition became public. On that day, he sent an e-mail to Deen's lawyer vowing that he was ""about to go public"" with information about the chef's use of the ""N-word"" at Lady and Sons, according to a copy of the e-mail cited in the criminal complaint. ""The statements are true and damning enough that the case for Jackson will be won on it's merit alone,"" Paculis wrote, according to the FBI. ""As always ... there is a price for such confirmation. ""You can contact me here if you feel it is necessary,"" he said, referring to his e-mail address, the criminal complaint states. ""Or I can go public and we will see what happens then."" Greg Hodges, Deen's lawyer, exchanged e-mails with Paculis and the two talked over the phone two days later, according to the FBI. It was then that Paculis allegedly asked for $250,000 ""net"" -- or total, with taxes having already been paid -- in exchange for not talking, the criminal complaint states. The two conversed a second time by phone June 27 when, ""at the direction of the FBI,"" Hodges negotiated the hush money payment down to $200,000. The next day, Deen told FBI agents that she didn't recognize Paculis's name or face, based on photographs. In tearful interview, Paula Deen slams 'horrible lies' Hodges declined comment on the alleged extortion arrest. Nancy Aldridge, who was married to Paculis for four months around 1986, told CNN that he once had his own restaurant in Savannah though she hasn't had much direct contact with him in recent years. Meanwhile, according to the FBI's criminal complaint, Paculis had also reached out to Jackson's lawyer. In fact, the agency alleges that the 62-year-old first reached out to Matt Billips by e-mail and phone on the same day -- June 24 -- that he contacted Deen's lawyer. Billips said his staff conducted its own investigation of Paculis. Paculis asked Jackson's lawyer how much he'd pay for derogatory information about Deen, the complaint claims. ""I have pushed the opposing firm to (give) me an amount of money, in cash to never been heard of again and to never utter Paula Deen's name in public or private ever again,"" Paculis allegedly wrote, according to an e-mail to Billips excerpted in the FBI complaint. ""Now the burning question is,"" he purportedly added, ""do you want in.""

"(EW.com) -- Animated movies have topped the box office for the past four weekends, but this time around, audiences were ready to embrace something a bit edgier. As such, Warner Bros.' horror film ""The Conjuring"" easily topped a crowded weekend with an eye-popping $41.5 million. The $20 million James Wan-directed title garnered the best horror debut of the year, trumping The Purge's $34.1 million bow in May. It also had the second-best debut ever for an R-rated horror film, trailing only Paranormal Activity 3, which opened with $52.6 million in 2011. The film notched a powerful $14,306 per theater average, and if it receives strong word-of-mouth (which seems likely), it could become a $100 million smash. Audiences, which were 53 percent female and 59 percent above the age of 25, issued The Conjuring an excellent ""A-"" CinemaScore grade — an especially impressive rating given the fact that the horror genre that has seen its fair share of ""D"" and ""F"" grades. The Conjuring's debut marks a career high for Wan, who broke onto the scene in 2004 with his $55.2 million hit Saw, a film so buzzy it steered horror films into the torture direction for years after its release. In 2011, Wan scored a spookier hit with Insidious, which, like The Conjuring, starred Patrick Wilson. Insidious earned $54 million against a $1.5 million budget and now has a sequel hitting theaters on September 13. The Conjuring will easily outgross both of those films, though it's all but guaranteed that Wan's next effort, Fast & Furious 7, will be his biggest hit yet. Despicable Me 2 held strong in second place, dipping 43 percent to $25.1 million in its third weekend. The $76 million sequel from Universal and Illumination Entertainment needed only 17 days to surpass the original Despicable Me's $251.5 million domestic total. Today, the film has earned $276.2 million. Overseas, Despicable Me 2 has already surpassed the $300 million mark, pushing its worldwide total to $584.6 million. In third place, Turbo started its box office run at a snail's pace. The $135 million animated comedy, featuring the voice of Ryan Reynolds as a radioactive snail, grossed $21.5 million in its first weekend — the worst debut for a DreamWorks Animation film since 2006′s Flushed Away opened with $18.8 million. Hot on the heels of Monsters University and Despicable Me 2, it's likely that Turbo suffered because audiences have had their fill of family fare over the past few weeks. Fortunately, the crowds that did see Turbo liked what they saw and gave it an ""A"" CinemaScore grade, which could help word-of-mouth in the future, though there's almost no chance the film matches its budget domestically. Turbo's lackluster debut casts some shadow on Fox and DreamWorks Animation's infant relationship. Earlier this year, Fox distributed The Croods, its first DreamWorks Animation-produced film in a five-year deal between the studios. The caveman comedy grossed $186 million domestically and $582 million worldwide. The fact that Turbo will come nowhere close to those numbers makes its opening all the more disappointing. Grown Ups 2 fell 52 percent from its first weekend to $20 million in its second frame. Sony's $80 million Adam Sandler comedy continues to perform well despite its critical savaging, and it has now earned $79.5 million after ten days. Grown Ups 2 is on track to pass the $100 million mark with ease, and it will become Sandler's 13th live-action comedy to reach that milestone. Whether you love Sandler or hate him, you can't deny his remarkable box office record. In fifth place, Red 2 took in $18.5 million, 15 percent less than the original Red's $21.8 million opening in 2010. The Summit sequel starring Bruce Willis, Helen Mirren, Mary Louise Parker, and John Malkovich, got a big budget-boost from its predecessor, but like The Expendables 2, that didn't grow the film's audience at the box office. While Red cost only $58 million and ultimately earned $199 million worldwide, Red 2 cost $85 million, and its weaker American debut suggests it won't climb nearly as high at the box office. Audiences gave Red 2 a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade. 1. The Conjuring -- $41.5 million . 2. Despicable Me 2 -- $25 million . 3. Turbo -- $21.5 million . 4. Grown Ups 2 -- $20 million . 5. Red 2 -- $18 million . Further down the chart, R.I.P.D., in which Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges play cops in the afterlife, bombed with $12.8 million in its first three days. The film also stars Mary Louise Parker, which means that both she and Reynolds faced themselves at the box office this weekend — and both fared poorly. In press notes sent to journalists this morning, Universal admits ""In this crowded marketplace, R.I.P.D. did not find the size audience it needed and Universal is disappointed in the weekend result."" The studio says the action comedy cost $130 million (though its budget has been reported at $154 million), which makes R.I.P.D. an expensive misfire for the studio that hasn't suffered a major misstep since Battleship. This year at the box office has been riddled with costly mistakes, and R.I.P.D. joins the ranks of After Earth, White House Down, The Lone Ranger, and Jack the Giant Slayer -- big-budget tentpoles that audiences firmly rejected. Crowds issued R.I.P.D. a negative ""C+"" CinemaScore. So for those of you keeping score: Turbo, Red 2, and R.I.P.D. collectively cost $350 million and earned $52.8 million this weekend at the box office. The Conjuring, meanwhile, cost $20 million and earned $41.5 million. See the original story at EW.com.
