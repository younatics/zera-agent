"Greece is on the way to economic recovery as investor faith returns to the recession-ridden eurozone nation, an executive at Greece's largest bank has told CNN. Petros Christodoulou, deputy chief executive of the National Bank of Greece, said that a drastic drop in government borrowing costs since the outbreak of the crisis in 2009 marks a ""great improvement and a great perception of the country"" by foreign investors. Speaking to CNN's Max Foster in Athens, Christodoulou said: ""Are we out of the woods with 8% yields in government debt? Not yet, but we are on the right path."" He added: ""All this eventually proliferates into everything that happens in Greece, starting from the banking sector which is in the center of the economy and this is good news going forward.""

Just seven days ago, Greek stocks, once spurned by investors over fears the country would need to exit the euro, beat every market in the world as the nation's six-year recession eased.

While on Tuesday, creditors -- made up of the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank -- visited Athens to meet policymakers and assess the country's finances. The group known as the 'Troika' remains at loggerheads with the government, led by Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, over the country's continued austerity program.

He added: ""I'm not worried about all this bickering here and there between the government and the Troika. At the end of the day, we've come a long way and we're now at the tail end.""

But the influx of investment is yet to filter down to an austerity-fatigued electorate with over a quarter of the population without jobs and youth unemployment at 55%, the highest in Europe. Nicholas Spiro, founder of Spiro Sovereign Strategy, told CNN that investor confidence in detached from the economic reality in Greece and largely based on the country's eurozone status being secure. He added: ""The kind of unemployment and the kind of headwinds that Greece is facing are simply too much. It's very difficult to see how Greece is going to stage any kind of meaningful recovery.""

On Wednesdsay, two of the country's largest public and private sector unions marched on parliament in a general 24-hour strike against the government's severe cuts to public services. Christodoulou, second-in-command at Greeks largest and oldest commercial bank, said he wasn't worried by the protests. Read more: IMF chief's warning to Europe . ""It's hardly surprising we've had the odd protest,"" he added, ""you have to look at things in a cumulative way and Greeks have come to accept, in a way, they are resigned to accepting all these measures."" Greece's economic renaissance . This week, the European Commission released its autumn economic forecast, estimating that Greece will emerge from recession in 2014 and projected solid growth of 2.9% for 2015 if the country maintains its current path. Spiro said that Greece will be ""very lucky"" to grow next year. ""This is a country that is still struggling to meet the terms of its bailout program,"" he added, ""they have been kicked into the long grass to keep the euro show on the road."" Greece fell into recession after the collapse of U.S. bank Lehman Brothers in 2008, which sparked a euro-wide debt crisis the following year. Since then the southern European nation has received 240 billion euros [$320 billion] from creditors to prevent a sovereign default on its debt and a possible exit from the 17-nation euro area. Christodoulou told CNN that the next step for Greece is to reduce state intervention in business. He finished by adding: ""In the old days, we had the Greek state directly or indirectly involved in about two thirds of Greek business, and it's the delight of all Greeks when we see this shrinking drastically now.""","Over a quarter of the Greek population are without jobs and youth unemployment is at 55%, the highest in Europe .

"The U.S. Senate on Monday voted 97 to 0 in approving modest reforms aimed at strengthening prosecution of sex assaults in the military. Last week, senators blocked legislation that would have dramatically altered the way serious crimes in the military, like sexual assault and rape, are handled. The newly approved bill now goes to the House for consideration. Sen. Claire McCaskill said the changes adopted Monday, which were designed to bolster a series of similar reforms adopted last year, mean the U.S. military has ""one of the most victim-friendly justice systems in the world."" For months, the Missouri Democrat and former prosecutor was locked in battle with fellow Democrat, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, over how to best reform sex assault prosecutions in the military. There has been a steep rise in reported cases in recent years. Some 26,000 incidents of sexual assault and unwanted sexual contact were reported in 2012 alone, according to a Pentagon study. Gillibrand's proposal, which was supported by a majority of senators but fell five votes shy of the 60 votes it needed to pass, would have removed commanders from deciding whether their subordinates should be prosecuted, leaving those decisions to military prosecutors. Opinion: New women's issues, new challenges . The idea was opposed by the Pentagon on the grounds that it would weaken command authority. McCaskill argued Gillibrand's proposal would have led to fewer prosecutions and warned more victims could face retaliation from their fellow service members if their commanders weren't involved in the cases. The bill approved Monday would largely disallow the so-called ""good soldier"" defense, which permits defendants to enter evidence of their good military character at trial to mitigate the charges against them. Groping allegation against Army officer who helps fight sex crime . It also gives victims input into whether their case is prosecuted in a military or civilian court, providing ""a victim a greater degree of control of his or her case,"" according to a summary provided by McCaskill's office. In addition, it would apply the reforms adopted last year to the military service academies. The major reforms that became law last year include: removing the authority of commanders to overturn convictions; providing attorneys to victims; making it a crime to retaliate against a victim; and requiring a dishonorable discharge for anyone convicted of sexual assault.

"(CNN)As ISIS continues it murderous rampage in the Middle East, Egypt's President said it's time for more Arab countries to join forces against the terror group. ""The need for a unified Arab force is growing and becoming more pressing every day,"" Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi said in a televised speech Sunday. El-Sisi said Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have offered military help as Egypt amplifies its battle against ISIS in neighboring Libya. CNN military analyst Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks said ""it's about time"" an Arab leader like el-Sisi made such a statement. ""Strategically and politically for the region, this is a big deal, and it's absolutely the right first step,"" the retired U.S. Army officer said. El-Sisi's statement came after U.S. President Barack Obama called for other countries last week to step up their efforts in the fight against ISIS. The United States is leading a coalition to fight ISIS from the sky over Iraq and Syria. But according to U.S. Central Command, 80% of the airstrikes have been conducted by the United States; the other 20% were launched by other coalition countries. And there's serious doubt about whether airstrikes alone will eliminate ISIS. ""The airstrikes aren't going to get the job done,"" CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes told CNN's ""New Day."" ""We need the Arab states to be the ones to eventually put the boots on the ground. Whether they actually end up doing it and being dedicated to this, we'll have to see."" El-Sisi didn't specify exactly what he meant by a ""united Arab force"" and whether that means troops on the ground. The idea of a pan-Arab force has been talked about for generations. But past efforts have been marred by distrust among Arab nations. Now, they have a common enemy in ISIS, a formidable regional threat. ISIS was initially known for trying to establish an Islamic State across parts of Iraq and Syria, and it has captured swaths of land in both countries. But the group is expanding its reach. Last week, ISIS released a gruesome video that appeared to show militants beheading 21 Egyptian Christians on a Libyan beach. In response, Egypt launched a series of airstrikes against ISIS in Libya. But in his speech Sunday, el-Sisi said the Egyptian army isn't trying to invade foreign territory. ""Your armed forces only protect the people of Egypt, and we coordinate with our Arab brothers,"" he said. Who's doing what in the coalition battle against ISIS? As world leaders talk about what to do about ISIS, the militants' atrocities and threats carry on. On Saturday, ISIS released a new propaganda video showing what appears to be Kurdish Peshmerga fighters paraded down Iraqi streets in cages atop pickup trucks. The video features a man saying the Peshmerga soldiers were captured by ISIS. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video. A man with a microphone bearing the ISIS logo interviews some of the captives. The prisoners, under duress, call on their fellow Peshmerga soldiers to give up their fight against ISIS. Watch: Who are the Peshmerga? The heavily edited footage also includes flashback images of  the beheadings of the Christian Egyptians. The man in the video gives an ominous warning: .

"(CNN) -- Richard Jewell, the security guard wrongly suspected and later cleared of setting off a deadly bomb at Atlanta, Georgia's Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 Olympics, died Wednesday morning, his attorney, Lin Wood, told CNN. Richard Jewell, who was wrongly suspected of setting off a bomb during the 1996 Olympics, has died. Jewell, 44, died of natural causes at his home in Woodbury, Georgia, according to Meriwether County Coroner Johnny Worley. Jewell had been suffering from diabetes and kidney failure since February, Worley said. Worley is working with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation on the autopsy, which should be completed Thursday afternoon. No foul play is suspected, he said.  Watch friends remember Jewell as dedicated » . After 12 weeks of scrutiny following the bombing, Jewell was cleared by the FBI and U.S. Attorney Kent Alexander in an unprecedented government acknowledgment of wrongful accusation. ""I am not the Olympic Park bomber,"" Jewell told reporters after being cleared. ""I am a man who has lived 88 days afraid of being arrested for a crime I did not commit."" The FBI, Jewell said, trampled on his rights ""in its rush to show the world it could get its man,"" while the news media ""cared nothing about my feelings as a human being"" in its rush to get a story on the bombing. Jewell was working as a private security guard in Centennial Olympic Park about 1 a.m. on July 27 when he noticed a suspicious unidentified package and began moving people away from it. The package turned out to contain a bomb, which eventually killed one person and wounded more than 100. Initially hailed a hero for moving people away, he was later cast in a different light when the FBI began investigating whether he had set off the bomb to give himself an opportunity to be a hero. For weeks, reporters and camera crews camped outside Jewell's Atlanta apartment, capturing every move that he -- and the FBI -- made. He later sued the FBI and several media organizations. CNN and NBC were among the organizations that settled with him. In April, 2005, Eric Robert Rudolph pleaded guilty to the bombing. Rudolph was captured in Murphy, North Carolina, in May 2003 after one of the largest manhunts in U.S. history. Rudolph also pleaded guilty to the 1998 bombing of a family planning clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed a police officer and two 1997 bombings at an abortion clinic and a gay nightclub in Georgia. He is serving four consecutive life sentences plus 120 years for the convictions.  E-mail to a friend .

"The Mega Millions jackpot is juicy, but thanks to new, longer odds, it's entirely possible the payout could reach $1 billion by Christmas. Nope, that wasn't a typo -- ""b"" as in ""boy."" When no winner was selected in Friday's drawing, the jackpot rolled over to $550 million, and it jumped again Monday to $586 million, with a cash payout of $316.5 million, said Tandi Reddick, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Lottery. The total could easily increase again before Tuesday night's drawing. If you're wondering how this stacks up against past prizes, it's the second-largest Mega Millions payout ever after the $656 million kitty collected in April 2012. Here is a look at the top five jackpots in history, according to lottery officials: . No. 1 -- In March 2012, lottery officials announced three winning tickets for the $656 million Mega Millions jackpot were sold in Kansas, Illinois and Maryland; . No. 2 --  A Florida woman won the $590.5 million Powerball jackpot in May; . No. 3 -- The $587.5 million Powerball jackpot was collected in November 2012 by a man in Arizona and a couple in Missouri; . No. 4 -- A $448.4 million Powerball jackpot was split by two winners in New Jersey and one in Minnesota in August; . No. 5 -- A single winner in South Carolina won the $399.4 million jackpot in September. So, the real question is: What are the chances of winning? Well, as CNN reported last week, you have a much, much better chance of being killed by an asteroid. And while those are long odds, they're even longer than they were in early October. That's because on October 22, Mega Millions made it more difficult to take home the big prize. The odds, which were 1 in 176 million, are now 1 in 259 million. This is a product of the lottery company increasing the pool of numbers to choose from. Previously, lottery players chose five numbers, ranging from one to 56. It's now one to 75, but the sixth, gold ball has fewer numbers from which to choose, as the pool decreased from 46 to 15. How many people have won since the new rules went into effect? Zero. And if that trend continues, lottery players could see their first 10-digit jackpot just in time for the holiday season. If nobody wins Tuesday night, the jackpot for Friday's drawing will begin at $800 million, said Paula Otto with the Virginia Lottery. Why you keep playing the lottery .

"The overall death toll in devastated Syria has surpassed an estimated 60,000 people, the United Nations said Wednesday, a dramatic figure that could skyrocket as the civil war persists. To put it in perspective: 60,000 people is roughly the population of Terre Haute, Indiana; or Cheyenne, Wyoming.  It's how many people would fit in Dodger Stadium, and it's more than the 50,000-plus U.S. combat deaths in Vietnam. The figure is about 15,000 higher than the death toll CNN had cited from a collection of sources. It's ""truly shocking"" and shameful, said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay, who blamed the international community for inaction. ""Collectively we have fiddled at the edges while Syria burns,"" she said. ""While many details remain unclear, there can be no justification for the massive scale of the killing highlighted by this analysis."" Inside Syria, anti-government activists brought their personal perspective to the new death estimate: ""No wonder!"" Hama activist Mousab Alhamadee said. ""We live on the ground and we see the massacres daily."" Western and Arab nations have denounced President Bashar al-Assad's regime, but they have been been reluctant to intervene in hopes of ending the warfare. What's next for Syria in 2013? They haven't been successful in forging tough action against Syria at the U.N. Security Council because of opposition from Russia and China, both of which have long had friendly relations with and economic ties to Damascus. While some countries have passed along weapons to the rebels, the larger world community has avoided being drawn into a war, fearing a bloody quagmire, such as the Vietnam War for the United States or the invasion of Afghanistan for the Russians. Echoing the fears of U.N.-Arab League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, Pillay worried about more deaths ""unless there is a quick resolution to the conflict."" ""I fear thousands more will die or suffer terrible injuries as a result of those who harbor the obstinate belief that something can be achieved by more bloodshed, more torture and more mindless destruction,"" she said. Pillay said the number of deaths is higher than expected. ""This massive loss of life could have been avoided if the Syrian government had chosen to take a different path than one of ruthless suppression of what were initially peaceful and legitimate protests by unarmed civilians,"" she said. ""As the situation has continued to degenerate, increasing numbers have also been killed by anti-government armed groups, and there has been a proliferation of serious crimes including war crimes, and -- most probably -- crimes against humanity, by both sides."" The 60,000, she said, ""is likely to be an underestimate of the actual number of deaths."" Citing the discovery of mass graves in newly liberated government bases, Alhamadee, the activist, said: ""The number I think is far greater than this, and lots of people are missing."" ""The recording and collection of accurate and reliable data has grown increasingly challenging due to the conflict raging in many parts of the country,"" Pillay said. Rupert Colville, a U.N. spokesman, agrees that the number ""is probably a minimum"" and reflects a killing field of war crimes. ""There's not a shadow of doubt now that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed. That said, in each individual case, the final judgment has to be made by a court. It's hard to quantify at this point,"" he said. ""This is a classic case of a conflict that's spiraling downwards, becoming ever more ghastly. We've seen this before in the Balkans and other places. The worse it becomes, the more difficult it is to resolve."" Ahawa, who posted a reaction on CNN.com's comment section, sees a dark future for Syria, regardless. ""Syria is doomed, no matter who wins, the terrorist rebels or the terrorist regime, the country ... will take tens of years to rebuild,' Ahawa wrote. ""Even if Assad is toppled in the next few months, sectarian fighting will still go on for years."" Wimcorbijn, another CNN.com commenter, accused Western and Arab nations of wanting to topple al-Assad at any cost. ""I think the best bet for Syria now is to keep Assad as leader,"" wimcorbijn wrote. ""It is the right time for (countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) to step in and support to help to defeat the rebels. Once the rebels are defeated, they can force to introduce democracy as well as political reforms in Syria."" Air attacks, shelling, tank fire, bomb attacks, street-to-street fighting and sectarian fighting have all contributed to the rising toll, Pillay said. Deaths have increased from 1,000 a month in the summer of 2011 to more than 5,000 a month since July, she said. Deaths have been most prevalent in Homs, the Damascus outskirts, Idlib, Aleppo, Daraa and Hama. More than three-quarters of the victims are male, and 7.5% are female, Pillay said. The gender of the others isn't clear, and analysts couldn't ""differentiate clearly between combatants and non-combatants."" The inability of the U.N. Security Council and the international community to stop the violence ""shames us all,"" she said. Read more: Syria's grim toll continues into 2013 . Death estimates have varied among opposition groups that have issued daily counts. For example, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 46,000 people have died since March 2011. U.N. data specialists counted 59,648 people reported killed in Syria between March 15, 2011, and November 30, 2012, Pillay said. Scores of deaths were reported every day in December. Related: 2013 prediction: 100,000 deaths . Latest clashes . On Wednesday, fighting sent the daily death toll higher. More than 207 people were killed, mostly in and around Damascus, according the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Syrian government warplanes hammered the Damascus suburbs and other targets.  At least 74 people died and dozens were wounded in the Damascus suburb of Mleiha when government planes carried out an airstrike on a fuel station, the LCC said, citing initial reports. The toll of ""martyrs"" will probably rise ""due to continuous pulling of the bodies from under the rubble,"" the LCC said. Aerial shelling also was reported in the Damascus suburb of Harasta, in the cities of Aleppo and Deir Ezzor and other locations. In Idlib province, Syrian rebels, including jihadists, fought to wrest a key military air base from government forces Wednesday, the opposition said, as anti-regime fighters kept up the heat on al-Assad's forces. Al-Nusra Front, a militant group that the United States designated last month as a terrorist movement, is among three rebel factions attacking the base, rebels said in a statement. ""The battle to liberate Taftanaz military airport has started,"" the rebels said. ""Taftanaz airport has been delivering horrors to Muslims. The warplanes fly from there on a daily basis, to throw explosive barrels on villages and towns."" Read more: Deadly day in Syria as diplomats talk . The other factions participating in the effort are Battalions of Ahrar Al-shaam and the Islamic Forefront. Ahrar is an Islamist coalition with some Salafist elements that cooperates with the Free Syrian Army. The Islamic Forefront is a larger umbrella group of Islamist organizations; one of its members is Ahrar. About 400 soldiers are based at the airport, along with a number of pro-government militia. At the base are 30 planes, including transportation craft and fighting jets; seven armored vehicles, including tanks and armored personnel carriers; artillery and rocket launchers. Casualties have been reported on both sides in the fighting, but precise numbers were not available because the government has restricted international journalists' access.

"The Navy is investigating the death in Afghanistan of one of its most senior SEAL officers as an apparent suicide, a U.S. military official tells CNN. Navy Cmdr. Job W. Price, 42, of Pottstown, Pennsylvania, died Saturday while serving as the commanding officer of SEAL Team 4, a special warfare unit based in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The official, who has direct knowledge of the event, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the death remains under full investigation by the U.S. military. The official said the family has been notified of the death and that it is being investigated as an apparent suicide. There is no indication at this time that Price was involved in any military-related investigations or controversies, the official said. Apparently, when Price did not appear at an expected time, other military personnel went to look for him and discovered his body with an apparent gunshot wound. As the commanding officer of the team, Price oversaw more than two dozen commandos and support staff conducting counterterrorism operations in Uruzgan Province in Afghanistan, a longtime center of insurgent activity, according to a statement from the Defense Department.","A senior Navy SEAL commander apparently committed suicide in Afghanistan .

"Growing up, Cecilia Lopez hoped to escape poverty by finishing school and becoming a teacher. But now 52 years old and having never finished school, she wishes she had learned a few things. ""If I knew back then about the choices in family planning, I would've been able to control having children,"" said Lopez, who has 12 children. ""If it were up to me, I wouldn't want to have so many. But I didn't use family planning, so basically they just kept coming and coming."" She eventually heard about the birth control pill from neighbors, but did not know how it worked. Moreover, she said she could not afford it. ""Instead of spending money on those, I use it to buy food,"" Lopez said. Her story is a familiar one in a country where 81% of Filipinos are devout Roman Catholic and 30% live below the poverty line, according to the Philippine National Statistics Office. While contraception is legal, the majority, like Lopez, do not have access or the means to afford birth control. But that could all change. After 14 years in limbo, a controversial landmark legislation called the Reproductive Health bill could bring major changes in the country of almost 96 million people. The proposed law requires the government to provide contraceptives, information on modern family planning methods at public health centers and comprehensive reproductive health curriculum in schools. National surveys show 65-70% of Filipinos support the bill, but it faces fierce opposition by the country's Roman Catholic Church leaders. Lawmakers are trying to negotiate a compromise, by addressing some of the strongest objections to the bill. The bill's co-author Congressman Edcel Lagman stated that amendments are in the works to emphasize that reproductive health services and information would be geared to the ""poorest and most marginalized households."" ""In order to obviate the unfounded criticism that the government will distribute contraceptives for free to everyone, the amendments will underscore that only the poorest of the poor will have free access to contraceptives if they are willing acceptors,"" Lagman said in a press release. A dozen children . In Lopez's small home in Tondo, a poor neighborhood in Manila, she and her family sleep, cook and eat inside one room. Seventeen people share a cramped 12-square meter room, one person next to another. Although limited in space, the room has a sense of order. An array of slippers in different sizes sits next to the front door. The family has one mattress and the rest sleep on the floor, covered with cardboard, mats and blankets.  Two pieces of plywood serve as a bed and a desk for one of her children. During the interview, her sleeping grandchild curled next to her teenage father, using a pair of adult shorts as a blanket. The walls are covered in family photos. Lopez is most proud of the school pictures showing three of her children, which bear the word ""Graduate,"" showing that they finished elementary school. Lopez hopes that unlike herself, her children will have choices. National statistics show that the Philippines population is growing at 1.98% and that it could reach 105 million by 2016. The growth rate is not the problem, said Ugochi Florence Daniels, the Philippine representative to the U.N. Population Fund. ""It's about the quality of life available to the segment of the population having the most children,"" she said. "" Poor women are the ones having more children. So as the Philippine population is growing, it's growing poorer."" Lopez first became pregnant at 17. Since then, she can't recall when she did not struggle to provide basic needs for their children. Her husband, a carpenter does not have steady work. ""If we earn money, they eat,"" she said, referring to her children. ""If we don't, they have nothing to eat all day. Most days they just bear with it. Even when they go to school without food."" ""I find it so hard when they go to school without food, without money. When they're hungry. I just want to cry most times."" With no one else to care for her growing family, Lopez stayed home to watch her children. Her adult children struggle to find work, because they didn't graduate from high school. ""The older ones had to stop going to school so the younger ones could start"", Lopez said. But her children appear to be entangled in a familiar cycle. Just like Lopez, her daughter became pregnant at 17. Her son became a father when he was 18, and her 17-year-old son is expecting a child soon. Lopez has three grandchildren. The health bill, Lopez said, would give her youngest the means to ""understand what happens with their bodies."" Young people in the Philippines lack health services and education, said Daniels from the U.N. Population Fund. This has caused a problem of skyrocketing teen pregnancy rates in the Philippines, which are the second highest in Southeast Asia. ""We are also failing the young people in the Philippines,"" she said. ""Ideally it's a time when young people are focused on education and skills- the things they need to live productive lives. Instead, we have a situation where children are having children."" A pack of condoms cost about 50 pesos and upwards, and birth control pills start at 100 pesos. When Lopez's husband can find work, he earns about 350 pesos a day. Condoms are sold in convenience stores and groceries, and pills are available, but they're harder to find in remote areas. The health bill would make various forms of birth control free and available to the country's poor. It would help quell the dramatic rise in maternal mortality rates, which has increased from 11 women dying per day to 15, from 2006 to 2010, said Daniels. It would also help address the fact that the Philippines is one of seven countries in the world where HIV rates are increasing, according to a U.N. report. Proponents of the Reproductive Health bill say it is about human rights, health and sustainable human development, not religion and sex. Church resistance . The Catholic Church hierarchy has seen the bill differently- saying that artificial birth control is a sin and its distribution will relax moral standards. ""Preventing fertilization is not a surgical, but a chemical or medical abortion,"" said Father Melvin Castro, executive secretary of the Episcopal Commission on Family and Life, of the Catholic Bishops Conference of Philippines. ""It's like okay, go ahead. As long as you don't get pregnant or you do not impregnate anyone, you can have any physical relationship. It will destroy the trend of marriage in our country. And slowly when you bring down the bar of morality, everything follows."" Castro said the government is infringing on territory beyond its authority by ""legislating an immoral law,"" and maintained that the state should not intervene in the moral and religious realm. But Lopez, who is Catholic and regular church-goer disagreed. With a faded print of Christ and the Last Supper hanging on a wall behind her, the mother of 12 said, ""The choice is yours if you need them for your own family, your own life. When you use them, it's not like you've sided with evil."" The battle over the health bill has both Catholic officials and lawmakers accusing each other of overstepping boundaries between church and state. The bill in its previous five attempts at passage, has languished in Congress. The stiff resistance from the Catholic Church, which is influential in politics, has prevented the passage of the bill, said Elizabeth Angsioco, national chairperson of the Democratic Socialist Women of the Philippines, which supports the health bill. In the past, politicians have hesitated openly supporting the bill in fear of going against the Catholic Church and damaging their chances of re-election, she said. ""Legislators are called on regularly by bishops, one by one, and some priests visit legislators in their districts, to 'convince them' to drop support or strengthen their opposition to the bill,"" she said. For years, politicians have feared the Church's moral influence on voters, said Solita Monsod, professor emerita at University of the Philippines, School of Economics. ""There are two kinds of Catholics in the Philippines, the unthinking - who say I don't need to read that bill because my priest is the guardian of my morality and whatever they say goes. And the thinking -- who will study the issues, follow their own conscience, and don't let anybody try to sway that,"" she said. But Father Castro denies that the church gets overly involved in politics. Bishops issue guidelines when Catholics decide whom to vote for, but they do not openly endorse political candidates, Castro said. ""It's up to the voters to ask themselves if this particular candidate possesses those needed criteria to lead our nation."" ""In the final analysis, no one can stop the priest when they want to do it. But they will never be ordered to do so by the bishops,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush and his top aides publicly made 935 false statements about the security risk posed by Iraq in the two years following September 11, 2001, according to a study released Tuesday by two nonprofit journalism groups. President Bush addresses the nation as the Iraq war begins in March 2003. ""In short, the Bush administration led the nation to war on the basis of erroneous information that it methodically propagated and that culminated in military action against Iraq on March 19, 2003,"" reads an overview of the examination, conducted by the Center for Public Integrity and its affiliated group, the Fund for Independence in Journalism. According to the study, Bush and seven top officials -- including Vice President Dick Cheney, former Secretary of State Colin Powell and then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice -- made 935 false statements about Iraq during those two years. The study was based on a searchable database compiled of primary sources, such as official government transcripts and speeches, and secondary sources -- mainly quotes from major media organizations.  See CNN viewers' reactions to the study » . The study says Bush made 232 false statements about Iraq and former leader Saddam Hussein's possessing weapons of mass destruction, and 28 false statements about Iraq's links to al Qaeda. Bush has consistently asserted that at the time he and other officials made the statements, the intelligence community of the U.S. and several other nations, including Britain, believed Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Responding to the study Wednesday, White House spokesman Scott Stanzel did not speak directly to the ""false claims"" characterization. But he said the United States was part of a broad coalition of nations that took part in the Iraq invasion and that the invasion was based on intelligence from multiple countries. He called Hussein a threat to international security and a sponsor of terrorism, and said the world is better off without him. White House press secretary Dana Perino called the study ""flawed."" ""They only looked at members of the administration, rather than looking at members of Congress or people around the world,"" she said. ""Because as you'll remember, we were part of a broad coalition of countries that deposed a dictator based on a collective understanding of the intelligence."" ""And the other thing that that study fails to do is to say that after realizing that there was no WMD, as we thought as a collective body that there was, that this White House, the President set about to make reforms in the intelligence community to make sure that it doesn't happen again."" Bush has repeatedly said that despite the intelligence flaws, removing Hussein from power was the right thing to do. The study, released Tuesday, says Powell had the second-highest number of false statements, with 244 about weapons and 10 about Iraq and al Qaeda. Former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Press Secretary Ari Fleischer each made 109 false statements, it says. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz made 85, Rice made 56, Cheney made 48 and Scott McLellan, also a press secretary, made 14, the study says. ""It is now beyond dispute that Iraq did not possess any weapons of mass destruction or have meaningful ties to al Qaeda,"" the report reads, citing multiple government reports, including those by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the 9/11 Commission and the multinational Iraq Survey Group, which reported that Hussein had suspended Iraq's nuclear program in 1991 and made little effort to revive it. The overview of the study also calls the media to task, saying most media outlets didn't do enough to investigate the claims. ""Some journalists -- indeed, even some entire news organizations -- have since acknowledged that their coverage during those prewar months was far too deferential and uncritical,"" the report reads. ""These mea culpas notwithstanding, much of the wall-to-wall media coverage provided additional, 'independent' validation of the Bush administration's false statements about Iraq."" The quotes in the study include an August 26, 2002, statement by Cheney to the national convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. ""Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of mass destruction,"" Cheney said. ""There is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends, against our allies, and against us."" E-mail to a friend .","Study searched database for statements by Bush, aides, in 2001-2003 .

"They'd just finished their middle school exams and were heading home to Kobani, Syria. But rather than relief and celebration, scores of Syrian Kurdish children say they endured torture and humiliation -- at the hands of ISIS. Human Rights Watch, an international advocacy organization, reported the allegations Tuesday based on interviews with four boys who said they were held by the Islamist extremist group for months. While CNN could not independently verify the claims, there certainly is precedent. International authorities, witnesses and people in the middle of yearslong strife in Syria and Iraq have accused ISIS of many misdeeds and war crimes in the past, including enslaving young women and children. Every story is hard to take, and those documented by Human Rights Watch are no exception. Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS . The boys, ages 14 to 16, said they were part of a group making the roughly 150-kilometer (100-mile) trek back from Aleppo from exams when ISIS militants halted and detained them on May 29. ISIS let approximately 100 girls go within hours, but they kept the boys at a school in Manbij, some 50 kilometers southwest of Kobani, according to the Human Rights Watch report. Their living conditions there were sparse: sleeping with blankets on the floor, bathing once every two weeks, eating twice a day and getting occasional visits and calls from their parents. And it got much worse from there. The interviewed boys talked about being forced to watch videos of ISIS beheadings and attacks, pray five times daily and memorize parts of the Quran. If they did not do well enough on their religious lessons, if they tried to escape, if they did anything that was construed as misbehaving -- or even if they did not -- the young captives could be beaten with hoses and electrical cables, according to the Human Rights Watch report. The advocacy group said one child was tied up with his hands tied behind his back and one hand tied to his foot after calling out for his mother. ""They sometimes beat us for no reason,"" a 16-year-old boy said. A 15-year-old boy said that the detained children who had relatives in the Kurdish militia known the People's Protection Units, or YPG, were treated the worst. YPG members were seen as nonbelievers in ISIS' extreme brand of Sunni Islam, thus making them second-class citizens at best and mortal enemies at worst. ""They (ISIS) told them to give them the addresses of their families, cousins, uncles, saying, 'When we go to Kobani, we will get them and cut them up,'"" the boy said. Some of the boys escaped, were released or were swapped for captive ISIS fighters between June and September. The terrorist group released about 75 boys -- including the four interviewed, who have since made their way across the border to Turkey -- in late September, with the equivalent of a U.S. dollar and a DVD featuring religious material. Kurdish officials said, according to HRW, that the remaining 25 boys were released a month later. The children's hometown of Kobani has been the site of a fierce weekslong battle between ISIS and Kurdish fighters. Local Kurds have been aided by U.S.-led airstrikes, as well as the recent arrival from Iraq of Kurdish fighters known as Peshmerga. Iraqi Kurdish fighters join Kobani fight . Situated on the Turkish border, Kobani is seen by many as a key battleground in ISIS' fight to expand its already vast territory in Syria. The extremist group has ruthlessly taken over much of this country in the past three-plus years as well as neighboring Iraq, with the U.N. Security Council and others alleging it has ""killed, kidnapped, raped, tortured or recruited as child fighters"" in the process.","Group: 4 say they were among 100 boys taken by ISIS on way back from exams .

"The U.S. Supreme Court will allow the National Security Agency's surveillance of domestic telephone communication records to continue for now. The justices without comment Monday rejected an appeal from a privacy rights group, which claimed a secret federal court improperly authorized the government to collect the electronic records. The Electronic Privacy Information Center filed its petition directly with the high court, bypassing the usual step of going to the lower federal courts first. Such a move made it much harder for the justices to intervene at this stage, but EPIC officials argued ""exceptional ramifications"" demanded immediate final judicial review. There was no immediate reaction to the court's order from the public interest group, or from the Justice Department. The NSA has publicly acknowledged it received secret court approval to collect vast amounts of so-called metadata from telecom giant Verizon and leading Internet companies, including Microsoft, Apple, Google, Yahoo and Facebook. The information includes the numbers, time, and length of nearly every phone call to and from the United States in the past five years, but not the location or actual monitoring of the conversations themselves. To do so would require a separate, specifically targeted search warrant. The revelations on bulk data collection triggered new debate about national security and privacy interests, and about the secretive legal process that sets in motion the government surveillance. The once-secret approval came in April from a judge at the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which handles individual requests for electronic surveillance for ""foreign intelligence purposes."" Verizon Business Network Services turned over the metadata to the government. Report: NSA, GCHQ among worst surveillance offenders, Snowden says . ""Telephone records, even without the content of the calls, can reveal an immense amount of sensitive, private information. There are no reasonable grounds for the NSA to have access to every call record of every Verizon customer,"" said Marc Rotenberg, president of EPIC. The Surveillance Court has applied the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ""in a way that is contrary to both the text and purpose of the statute,"" he said. This is the first direct challenge to the court order, and EPIC said the Obama administration should have to publicly explain its legal justification for the spying program. The group also argued restrictions in federal law mean no other state or federal court can review the Surveillance Court's orders except the Supreme Court itself. The group is suing on behalf of itself as a Verizon customer, but also said the justices themselves have a stake in the legal fight. ""Because the NSA sweeps up judicial and congressional communications, it inappropriately arrogates exceptional power to the executive branch,"" said the petition. The revelations of the NSA program and the inner workings of the Surveillance Court came after a former agency contractor, Edward Snowden, leaked documents to the Guardian newspaper in Britain. Snowden fled to Hong Kong and then Russia to escape U.S. prosecution, and his supporters say they are working on asylum deals with other countries on his behalf. The Justice Department urged the high court to stay out of the current fight, called a ""mandamus"" review. EPIC's petition ""does not meet the stringent requirements for mandamus relief, and this court lacks jurisdiction"" to act, Solicitor General Donald Verrilli said in the government's brief, filed last month. ""The mandamus petition does not establish that it is more than speculative that the NSA has reviewed, or might in the future review, records pertaining to petitioner's members, particularly given the stringent, (Surveillance Court)-imposed restrictions that limit access to the database to counterterrorism purposes,"" the Obama administration added. The U.S. Supreme Court does not comment on pending cases. The privacy rights group now has the option of going back to the lower courts and starting the legal process anew. Prior lawsuits against the NSA program have been unsuccessful. Opinion: Has the NSA gone rogue? Days after Snowden's disclosure of the NSA program, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in New York federal court. The San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation did so in July. And Freedom Watch also filed a separate claim on behalf of Verizon customers. The suits are still pending. Telecoms themselves were the initial targets of legal action, after the NSA domestic surveillance program was unveiled in 2005. Congress later gave retroactive immunity to those private firms. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court secretly decides whether to grant certain types of government requests, including wiretapping, data analysis, and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States. Legal sources say the tiny courtroom and adjacent areas are sealed tightly -- ironically given the political debate -- to prevent any eavesdropping by outsiders. Eleven federal judges from around the country serve on the court for seven-year terms. They are appointed by the chief justice of the United States. John Roberts has named all current members, as a well as a three-judge panel to hear appeals of the Surveillance Court's orders, known as the Court of Review. Because it is an ""ex-parte"" body -- it hears only the government's side -- the court has been criticized as a kangaroo court that too easily accedes to any government request. In order to collect information, the government has to demonstrate that it's ""relevant"" to an international terrorism investigation. The 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court Act lays out exactly what the special court must decide: . ""A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States, interfere with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation, interfere with diplomatic relations, or endanger the life or physical safety of any person."" Several federal judges who once served on the Surveillance Court refused to discuss their service when contacted by CNN. The case is In Re Electronic Privacy Information Center (13-58).

"(CNN) -- The U.S. should stop arresting responsible marijuana users, Rep. Barney Frank said Wednesday, announcing a proposal to end federal penalties for Americans carrying fewer than 100 grams, almost a quarter-pound, of the substance. Rep. Barney Frank's bill would radically curb federal penalties for personal marijuana use. Current laws targeting marijuana users place undue burdens on law enforcement resources, punish ill Americans whose doctors have prescribed the substance and unfairly affect African-Americans, said Frank, flanked by legislators and representatives from advocacy groups. ""The vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the government's business,"" Frank said on Capitol Hill. ""I don't think it is the government's business to tell you how to spend your leisure time."" The Massachusetts Democrat and his supporters emphasized that only the use -- and not the abuse -- of marijuana would be decriminalized if the resolution resulted in legislation.  Watch Frank lay out the proposal » . The Drug Enforcement Administration says people charged with simple possession are rarely incarcerated. The agency and the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy have long opposed marijuana legalization, for medical purposes or otherwise. Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, meaning it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, according to the drug control office. ""Smoked marijuana has not withstood the rigors of science -- it is not medicine and it is not safe,"" the DEA states on its Web site. ""Legalization of marijuana, no matter how it begins, will come at the expense of our children and public safety. It will create dependency and treatment issues, and open the door to use of other drugs, impaired health, delinquent behavior, and drugged drivers."" Allen St. Pierre, spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, likened Frank's proposal -- co-sponsored by Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- to current laws dealing with alcohol consumption. Alcohol use is permitted, and the government focuses its law enforcement efforts on those who abuse alcohol or drive under its influence, he said. ""We do not arrest and jail responsible alcohol drinkers,"" he said. St. Pierre said there are tens of millions of marijuana smokers in the United States, including himself, and hundreds of thousands are arrested each year for medical or personal use. iReport.com: Is it time to legalize pot? There have been 20 million marijuana-related arrests since 1965, he said, and 11 million since 1990, and ""every 38 seconds, a marijuana smoker is arrested."" Rob Kampia, director of the Marijuana Policy Project, said marijuana arrests outnumber arrests for ""all violent crimes combined,"" meaning police are spending inordinate amounts of time chasing nonviolent criminals. ""Ending arrests is the key to marijuana policy reform,"" he said. Reps. William Lacy Clay, D-Missouri, and Barbara Lee, D-California, said that in addition to targeting nonviolent offenders, U.S. marijuana laws unfairly target African-Americans. Clay said he did not condone drug use but opposes using tax dollars to pursue what he feels is an arcane holdover from ""a phony war on drugs that is filling up our prisons, especially with people of color."" Too many drug enforcement resources are being dedicated to incarcerating nonviolent drugs users, and not enough is being done to stop the trafficking of narcotics into the United States, he said. Being arrested is not the American marijuana smoker's only concern, said Bill Piper of the Drug Policy Alliance Network. Those found guilty of marijuana use can lose their jobs, financial aid for college, their food stamp and welfare benefits, or their low-cost housing. The U.S. stance on marijuana, Piper said, ""is one of the most destructive criminal justice policies in America today."" Calling the U.S. policy ""inhumane"" and ""immoral,"" Lee said she has many constituents who are harassed or arrested for using or cultivating marijuana for medical purposes. California allows medical marijuana use, but the federal government does not, she explained. House Resolution 5843, titled the Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2008, would express support for ""a very small number of individuals"" suffering from chronic pain or illness to smoke marijuana with impunity. According to NORML, marijuana can be used to treat a range of illnesses, including glaucoma, asthma, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS and seizures. Frank, who is chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said that about a dozen states have approved some degree of medical marijuana use and that the federal government should stop devoting resources to arresting people who are complying with their states' laws. In a shot at Republicans, Frank said it was strange that those who support limited government want to criminalize marijuana. Asked whether the resolution's passage would change his personal behavior, Frank quipped, ""I do obey every law I vote for"" but quickly said he did not use marijuana, nor does he encourage it. ""I smoke cigars. I don't think other people should do that. If young people ask me, I would advise them not to do it,"" he said. If HR 5843 were passed, the House would support marijuana smokers possessing up to 100 grams -- about 3½ ounces -- of cannabis without being arrested. It would also give its blessing to the ""nonprofit transfer"" of up to an ounce of marijuana. The resolution would not address laws forbidding growing, importing or exporting marijuana, or selling it for profit. The resolution also would not speak to state laws regarding marijuana use.","DEA, White House say marijuana dangerous, has no accepted medical use .

"In recent days, Bitcoins have enjoyed a media buzz as the value of one Bitcoin jumped on several Bitcoin exchanges to more than $200 per Bitcoin. But by Wednesday, it fell to $105. Bitcoins are an attempt at creating an electronic currency that is beyond the control of any government. They are created through a digital mining system, in which digital ""miners"" are granted Bitcoins by using their computers to do computations that verify Bitcoin transactions.  Pretty clever. With allegedly strict rules on the creation of Bitcoins, the money supply is limited. Theoretically, no government can water down the Bitcoin with any type of quantitative easing. As a result, Bitcoins seem to present the best of all possible worlds -- the convenience of modern digital payment technology and the stability of a fixed money supply. Fearmongers point out that banks are no longer safe as government authorities in the European Union have signaled their willingness to confiscate funds from even insured depositors. Those fearing the collapse of their local currency or their local banking system won't have to lug around hunks of metal as a way to store their wealth. Why not turn to Bitcoins? The near anonymity built into the Bitcoin system keeps funds away from the prying eyes of tax collectors, who are getting ever better at shutting down tax havens. This potential for anonymity makes the currency ideal for drug smugglers, terrorists and money launderers, as well as the merely paranoid. So are Bitcoins the currency of the future?  I think not. No one really knows who is really behind Bitcoins, as the creator is just a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. That in itself should be a huge red flag. I would certainly not trust my life savings to some mysterious computer algorithm created by shadowy anonymous characters in a system that attracts underworld types. One of the self-proclaimed largest Bitcoin exchanges is Mt. Gox. The name originally stood for Magic: The Gathering Exchange, an online site designed to trade cards used in playing the card game popular with the younger set. An exchange based on trading kiddy cards does not seem like a sound foundation for a monetary system. There is no government regulating participants in the system to prevent fraud and abuse. I would not be surprised if the Bitcoin mining software becomes a magnet for computer viruses.  After all, the tax evaders, drug dealers and terrorists attracted to Bitcoin would not be likely to cooperate with authorities when they have been hacked and robbed. It would be close to the perfect crime to create a pseudomonetary system that rips off other evildoers.  Just be careful when the bad guys find out where you live. Even if the system is not one big scam designed to enrich its shadowy creators, it can be hacked and can break like any technology. The authorities won't be too eager to help out Bitcoin-based financial enterprises when they get in trouble, just as they were all too eager to punish the depositors of the Cyprus banks storing questionable funds from Russian oligarchs. Rather than being a safe place to keep money, the exchange rate of Bitcoins relative to other global currencies has fluctuated wildly.  The recent jumps on price give all of the impression of being a bubble that could soon pop. If Bitcoin ever could establish itself as a legitimate payment scheme, which I doubt, it's hard to tell what the appropriate exchange rates should be with respect to other currencies. Bitcoins are not the first attempt to create digital money. Other ventures, such as Cybercash, have come and gone, as well as various attempts to create local currencies. Governments don't like the competition.  Managing a currency is a very profitable activity for governments, and they depend on seignorage -- the profit stemming from printing money -- in various degrees to cover budget deficits. Indeed, one can always pay the troops by printing more almost worthless money, as the U.S. did in the American Revolution and Robert Mugabe did in Zimbabwe.  One can expect governments to throw up legal roadblocks to prevent such competition from cutting into the lucrative business of printing money. Moreover, it would not be good for the global economic system to have a totally fixed money supply. A growing economy needs a money supply that grows at the same rate to keep prices stable.  Much as we love to criticize the governmental entities that control the monetary system, it does help to have some human judgment (armed with a checkbook) involved to deal with crises. Our banking system is as safe as it is because there are lenders of last resort who can create more money in a crisis to protect the entire system from collapsing in a liquidity crisis. Iceland and Cyprus have discovered how painful it is to have a banking system without such a deep pocket lender of last resort. A financial system based on Bitcoins would have no possibility of there being such a backstop. In short, Bitcoins look like quite a bit of trouble.","Bitcoins have enjoyed a media buzz as the value of one Bitcoin jumped as high as $200 .

"It is impossible to ignore the impact of Pope Francis, a modern-day pope who operates with humility and directness, who lives simply, who prefers to spend his time with the poor and the marginalized, and who sees his role as pastor, compassionate friend and fellow sinner on the Christian journey. The photos of Pope Francis embracing a man disfigured by neurofibromatosis and the scene of the little boy on the stage in Vatican Square as Francis addressed pilgrims tell us all we need to know about the humanity and accessibility of our new Pope. Some bishops are desperately trying to reassure their followers that nothing is changing. But that's a tough sell when the head of the Roman Catholic Church tells his bishops that they are obsessed with abortion, contraception and same-sex marriage and when he says he doesn't judge gays and lesbians. Something is changing. But is this change simply one of tone? Francis' comments on the appointment of bishops suggest that his criteria has less to do with loyalty and orthodoxy and more to do with pastoral experience and compassion. But in his first American appointment, one that was not in the pipeline before his papal election, he named Bishop Leonard Blair as the new archbishop of Hartford, Connecticut. Blair is a true believer culture warrior and former Vatican official who led the charge against the Leadership Conference of Religious Women last year and earlier joined in the condemnation of Notre Dame University for having President Barack Obama as a speaker.  And in light of Francis closing the door on female priests, many women theologians and lay leaders are wondering about his emphasis on a new role for women in the church. Jamie Manson, a Yale trained theologian and a writer for National Catholic Reporter, suggests that we should not get too excited. For her, the bottom line is that in spite of the warmth and sincerity of the Pope's words, he is not indicating any change in church teaching. She points out that the Pope says that the church does not want to wound gays and lesbians, but ""Francis doesn't seem to understand that it is precisely the teaching of the church that is doing the wounding."" And Manson asks the broader question: ""What good is a more pastoral church when ultimately, gays and lesbians are still told their relationships are sinful, women are still barred from answering God's call to ordained ministry, African-American women and men routinely affected by HIV/AIDS cannot get access to condoms, women in need of lifesaving abortions are forced to die, and starving families in countries like the Philippines are denied access to condoms?"" Manson has a point. It's possible that the most that Francis' words will accomplish will be to neutralize those bishops who lean whichever way the papal wind blows. Worse, the pope's comments will provide protective cover for the more outspoken orthodox bishops. They might tone down their comments, but they will not change their attitudes or their policies. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York may praise Francis, but this is the man who has compared same-sex marriage to incest and declared that gays and lesbians ""don't have the right stuff."" And San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, the American church's cheerleader against same-sex marriage, hasn't let Francis' softer tone slow down his continued negative crusade. Cordileone and others like him are young enough to wait out Francis, organize before the next papal conclave and put a true believer back in place. Pope Francis may be a bridge builder, but for now, no bridge is long enough to span the dichotomy between the church's expression of love for gays and lesbians and the simultaneous condemnation of them when they act consistent with their nature. I'm a 73-year-old, white, heterosexual male and have not been on the receiving end of the ignorance, hate and narrow orthodoxy that religious belief can still stir up. But Jamie Manson and her partner have been. My son and his partner have been. And thousands like them, all made in the image and likeness of God, have been on the receiving end of hate and ignorance, and in the context of our church, the maddening, wounding, mixed message of love and condemnation. Until there is an openness to new interpretations of Scripture regarding homosexuality, until the new thinking on natural law is accepted that sexual orientation is not a choice but part of the nature of the person and until the growing number of moral theologians who offer compelling arguments that sexual acts should be seen in terms of harm or good to individuals rather than in terms of offending God, there is no lasting change and the wounds remain open. And our new Pope, unintentionally, may seduce many into thinking that things are getting better and provide cover for the Cordileones of our church to continue their campaign of condemnation and exclusion. On the other hand, I've learned from my own recent life experiences that God's grace can mysteriously arise out of excruciating pain, so I don't give up hope. Nor would I want to underestimate the potential grace of a modern-day pope who prioritizes Jesus' message of love and inclusiveness over doctrine and orthodoxy.

"As President Barack Obama presses his case for a strike on Syria, a new national survey shows him swimming against a strong tide of public opinion that doesn't want the United States to get involved. The CNN/ORC International poll released on Monday shows that even though eight in 10 Americans believe that Bashar al-Assad's regime gassed its own people, a strong majority doesn't want Congress to pass a resolution authorizing a military strike against it. More than seven in 10 say such a strike would not achieve significant goals for the United States and a similar amount say it's not in the national interest for the country to get involved in Syria's civil war. See complete poll results (PDF) The poll comes at the start of a pivotal week for the president. The Senate is expected to take up the resolution after returning from its summer recess on Monday while Obama participates in a round of interviews with the major television outlets. Wolf Blitzer's interview with Obama will air Monday on ""The Situation Room"" at 6 p.m. ET. Three questions for Obama . Amid a flurry of briefings by White House officials, Obama will travel to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to make his case with lawmakers hours before he speaks to the nation in a prime-time address. ""Even as he works members of Congress one by one in small group settings, President Obama's biggest challenge is the American public at large,"" said John King, CNN chief national correspondent. ""More than seven in 10 Americans simply don't see a military response making any difference. They don't see it doing any good. They're very skeptical, post Iraq and even post Libya and post Egypt, that the United States can do something in a limited way in the Middle East and walk away with a success. And so the skepticism is driving it right now."" The stakes are high for the president. After pushing for strikes against Syria, Obama unexpectedly announced on August 31 that he would ask Congress to authorize military action. Failing to get Congress to go along would be an embarrassment for the commander in chief. ""He'll go to establishing a new high bar to what it means to being a lame duck this early,"" CNN contributor and Republican strategist Ana Navarro said. ""It would be devastating, I think, for rest of his agenda."" But Stephanie Cutter, another CNN contributor who was Obama's 2012 deputy campaign manager, said Congress's not passing the resolution would be ""a blow to the United States, not a blow to the president. It's a blow to the United States' authority all over the world. And unprecedented."" ""That's why you're going to see some members of Congress vote for that particular reason. Some said they're voting for that particular reason,"" she said. Obama faces steep climb in House . The Senate could vote on the resolution as early as Wednesday and the outcome there is very much in doubt. Even more uncertain are prospects in the House where Republican leaders say they'll wait to see what happens in the Senate first. ""Congressional approval would help Obama a little, but a majority would still oppose airstrikes against military targets in Syria,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""If Congress authorizes military action, 55% of Americans would still oppose airstrikes."" The president has had at least a small majority of public support behind him in conflicts involving the United States over the past 20 years. Eighty-six percent of those surveyed in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll less than a month after the 9/11 terror attacks favored military action, and 56% backed the United States and its allies in creating a ""no-fly"" zone over Libya in 2011. Only U.S. involvement in NATO airstrikes on Serbia in 1999 during the Clinton administration split the public down the middle, with 43% supporting involvement and 40% opposing it. 'This is not Iraq or Afghanistan' While 64% supported using American ground troops in Iraq in 2003, intelligence indicating Saddam Hussein was building weapons of mass destruction was later discredited. That has contributed to  public doubts about Obama administration claims of evidence showing that al-Assad's regime gassed its own people on August 21 outside Damascus, killing more than 1,400 people. Fifty-nine percent of people questioned say they don't think Congress should approve a proposed resolution authorizing military action against Syria for up to 90 days -- an initial 60-day window plus another 30 following congressional notification -- but prohibiting the use of ground troops. About 40% support that plan. If Congress rejects the Syria resolution, the White House has said that the president still has the authority to strike. ""I think it would be a mistake for me to jump the gun and speculate because right now I'm working to get as much support as possible out of Congress,"" Obama said on Friday when asked by CNN senior White House correspondent Brianna Keilar what he would do if the resolution failed. But the poll indicates Americans are quite clear on that point: More than seven in 10 say they would oppose U.S. airstrikes against Syria if Congress does not authorize it. Who are the Syrian rebels? The debate over Syria has caused intra-party divides among both parties: Hawkish Republicans and moderate Democrats say the United States should strike, while the libertarian wing of the GOP says involvement is not in the U.S. interest. Liberal Democrats say there are alternatives to military action that haven't been exhausted. The poll also suggests those surveyed who identified themselves as  Democrats and Republicans don't see eye to eye on the resolution. Fifty-six percent of Democrats think Congress should pass it, but only 36% of Republicans and 29% of independents say the same. ""Bringing Congress into the equation seems to have added a political dimension to the Syria debate,"" Holland said. ""Once Congress makes up its mind, however, the gap between Democrats and Republicans nearly vanishes."" 'House of Assad' survives on loyalty, brutality . If Congress does authorize military action, the gap between Democrats and Republicans shrinks to just four points, with 51% of Democrats and 47% of Republicans favoring military action. And if Congress rejects the resolution authorizing military action, large numbers in both parties oppose airstrikes. ""It appears that while the debate is still in the hands of Congress, politics will affect Americans' views on Syria,"" Holland said.  ""Politics may still stop at the water's edge for most Americans, but Capitol Hill remains a highly partisan environment, even when international affairs are being debated."" The poll gives some insight into why many Americans oppose action. While more than eight in 10 say that it's likely or certain that the Syrian government used chemical weapons, nearly seven in 10 say that it's not in the U.S. national interest to get involved in Syria's civil war. And more than seven in 10 say that airstrikes would not achieve significant goals for the U.S. Syria's neighbors on edge . And while most of those questioned said that how their members of Congress voted on the resolution wouldn't affect how they voted in future elections, but the remainder by a nearly 3-1 margin said they would be more likely to vote against the lawmakers if they supported the resolution. The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International on September 6-8, with 1,022 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.","7 in 10 poll respondents say they don't think a strike on Syria would achieve U.S. goals .

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Odile snapped palm trees like twigs, washed out roads and left tourists trapped in Mexican resorts Monday. Even as it weakened into a Category 1 hurricane, the storm threatened to bring torrential rains and flooding as it moved over the Baja California peninsula, forecasters said. Already, the hurricane has left stunned residents and tourists in its wake. Sarah McKinney, who was in Cabo San Lucas on maternity leave from her job in Arkansas when the then-Category 3 storm hit with 125 mph winds Sunday night, tweeted photos of the wreckage Monday: the collapsed roof of a restaurant, a shuttle van flipped over, a resort's swimming pool pushed into the ocean. Every car she walked by after the storm had broken windows, she wrote. The normally pristine marina in the idyllic resort town was littered with debris. ""2 days ago we walked along the marina happy with not a care in the world,"" she said. ""Today I'm shocked and saddened."" The powerful storm caused severe damage at the airport in Los Cabos, Mexico's national director of civil protection said, according to CNN affiliate FOROtv. Monday night the storm was about 30 miles (50 km) southwest of Loreto, Mexico, packing winds of 75 mph (120 kph) as it headed northwest. It was expected to weaken into a tropical storm early Tuesday, the National Hurricane Center said. On Sunday, gales from Odile whipped torrents of rain ashore, chasing visitors in popular tourist destinations into close quarters. Streets in Cabo San Lucas were drenched. Palm trees were knocked over, and outdoor markets were trashed. Raul Frias, from Mexico City, was at Club Regina in Cabo when he tweeted that he felt a ""great vibration"" in a shelter and that something ""big was coming down."" McKinney and her newborn daughter, Madison, had already evacuated out of harm's way from their first hotel to a second one. But even there, the room roared like a wind tunnel as Odile passed over. At least 15,000 tourists were sharing McKinney's experience in Cabo, Mexican civil defense official Luis Felipe Puente said. She piled up her belongings in the bathtub to protect them from the water seeping through the door to her room. She dammed it up with a mattress, but it still came in about an inch deep. ""I've cleared the beds and linen closets and have my daughter and I held up in the bathroom,"" she told CNN. Then the winds subsided. Madison fell asleep. ""The pressure was horrific, but now it is eerily calm -- just how people describe when the eye passes over,"" she said. But then the winds smacked the hotel again, and McKinney headed back into the bathroom. ""The backhalf is definitely worse,"" she posted to Twitter. ""More debris and stronger winds and rain. Bedroom is getting soaked from water seeping in."" Odile was earlier predicted to bring possibly life-threatening flash floods and mudslides, forecasters said Sunday. Ports and beaches have been closed, and school classes and celebrations for Mexico's Independence Day were canceled in Baja California Sur state. Independence Day is Tuesday.

"(CNN)""Shocked and frozen."" Those are two words that Mark and Ismini Svensson say perfectly describe their families' reaction to their unique wedding plans. Instead of having a typical ceremony, complete with cake and family photos, the couple chose a different path: To celebrate their love by sharing good deeds across the country with people they'd never met. For past two years, the newlyweds have been spending their wedding budget to perform one act of kindness in each of the 50 states. The Svenssons plan to complete their mission this spring. The New York-based couple met as students, while attending Georgetown University. They say it was their mutual love of volunteerism and community activism that drew them together. ""It just clicked,"" says Mark Svensson. ""We both had this passion within us."" While in the midst of selecting a venue for a more traditional wedding ceremony, they had a change of heart. ""We were actually planning a big wedding reception and honeymoon,"" Ismini says. ""We realized that our way of celebrating our love would be different, and we came up with 50 Acts of Giving Back."" For Ismini, the idea of sharing goodwill in place of a wedding also became a special way to honor the legacy of her father, a civil engineer and philanthropist who taught her the importance of making a difference. ""The father of the bride plays important role on the wedding day, and I realized my father wouldn't be there."" Ismini says her father suddenly passed away from heart attack while hosting a charity event that gave college scholarships to underserved youth.  At that event, Ismini's father delivered his last speech -- focusing on the importance of love and the importance of giving back. So, Mark and Ismini ditched the idea of a formal wedding. No flower bouquet was tossed. No speeches were made, and no family pictures taken. The New York couple quietly exchanged vows at a courthouse. They named their mission, ""50 Acts of Giving Back"" and took to Facebook and Twitter for suggestions of where to go.  Soon the couple was overwhelmed with responses. They say each stated visited was the result of an online discussion. After sharing their idea on social media, their friends and followers echoed the message through Facebook shares and retweets. Using the hashtag #50Acts, the Svenssons say they were contacted by people across the country in need of their support. What started as a way to honor the legacy of Ismini's father became an online campaign to promote the couple's first love: volunteerism. ""Social media, whether it's a post or a tweet, can impact your world,"" Mark says. ""It may seem small, but it can go a long way."" After hearing of their initiative, Mark and Ismini say others were so inspired by their story, people began to donate to their cause. The couple continued to self-fund ""50 Acts of Giving Back"" but used the monetary donations to start a nonprofit, StayUNITED. This way they would be able to continue their charitable work once their 50 state journey was completed. After selecting a location with the help of their online friends, the Svenssons rented a car and drove to each state. Although challenging, it became the Svenssons best way to travel as they soon learned they were expecting their first child! After their daughter Rafealla was born, the couple hit the road again with her in the backseat. ""She became a part of this journey. She was always with us,"" Ismini says. ""Everybody loved her. The baby became like the little mascot."" In Asheville, North Carolina, they brought flowers and presents to patients suffering from cancer. In Aramillo, Texas they assisted elderly men and women with grocery shopping.  In Connecticut, the couple participated in an adaptive sports camp for children with disabilities. At the conclusion of the camp, the couple says they presented gifts to the children. ""Because of all the support received from all over the U.S., we realized this journey is much bigger than a wedding,"" Ismini says. Although rewarding, the couple admits there were challenges. In addition to handling the daily tasks of having a newborn, Mark and Ismini balanced worked schedules as well. Working in a family business allowed them the flexibility to travel, but they say coordination was key. ""Some states you literally have to drive seven hours just to get to the next area,"" Mark commented. ""It's definitely something you have to be mentally prepared for."" The couple's next move? The Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Hawaii and Alaska. They hope to wrap up their journey by spring of 2015. ""We believe in a chain reaction of kindness,"" Ismini says.  ""It's all about realizing us doing our part in something much bigger than ourselves and giving back.""","Mark and Ismini Svensson were planning a big wedding reception and honeymoon when they had a change of heart .

"More than 1 million Iraqis have been forced from their homes by conflict this year, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday -- a number likely only to rise as Islamist militants and Iraqi security forces battle for control. A humanitarian crisis is brewing, as families who've fled fighting with little more than the clothes on their back seek water, food and shelter from the summer heat. Meanwhile, the first of up to 300 U.S. military advisers will arrive in Iraq as soon as Saturday, a senior defense official told CNN. This first group from outside Iraq is expected to be very small, the official said. In addition, some U.S. military personnel already in Iraq at the security cooperation office in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad will be reassigned and become the first of the advisers to go to work,  Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. An estimated 500,000 people fled Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, last week after it fell to fighters from the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq (ISIS). On Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross in Iraq put the number who fled Mosul, with its population of 1.6 million, at about 800,000. Already, a half-million people were displaced from Iraq's western Anbar province, where Sunni militants have been dominant since early this year. U.S. sending military advisers . For days, the United States has considered what to do about the militants, and on Thursday, President Barack Obama said he was prepared to send as many as 300 military advisers to Iraq, adding that America was not returning to a combat role in the country. The first group of advisers will begin work by conducting an initial assessment of Iraqi troop capabilities and on what may be needed for a larger group of U.S. advisers, including additional security measures where they may be deployed, a senior defense official said Friday. But the United States has not reached an agreement with Iraq to provide legal protections to the U.S. military advisers. ""We are pursuing something in writing,"" Kirby said Friday. He said Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ""is absolutely committed to making sure that our troops have the legal protections, and he would not do that on a nod and a wink."" Kirby said the U.S. did not foresee a problem getting the Iraqi government to sign such an agreement because Iraq had requested this U.S. support. The United States withdrew its final troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, nearly nine years after leading the invasion that ousted longtime leader Saddam Hussein. Al-Maliki under pressure . As ISIS, born from an al Qaeda splinter group and supported by many Sunni factions, continues its fierce advance in Iraq, senior U.S. officials tell CNN that the Obama administration is of the belief that Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is not the leader Iraq needs to unify the country and end sectarian tensions. The Prime Minister's Shiite-dominated government is accused of fostering sectarian tensions by marginalizing Iraq's Sunni Arab and Kurd minorities. Obama told CNN on Friday that U.S. military efforts are hopeless without a change in government. ""If we don't see Sunni, Shia and Kurd representation in the military command structure, if we don't see Sunni, Shia and Kurd political support for what we're doing, we won't do it,"" he told CNN's Kate Bolduan in an interview. The complete interview will be aired Monday on CNN's ""New Day."" ISIS takes old chemical facility . Fighting raged across Iraq. Iraqi security forces regained control of the Baiji oil refinery, the largest in Iraq, on Friday following a night of fighting, Iraqi security officials in Samarra told CNN. Iraqiya State TV reported that Iraqi security forces killed an undisclosed number of ISIS fighters. Also on Thursday, ISIS militants took control of a facility that Saddam Hussein once used to produce and store chemical weapons. But the State Department doubts that the Al Muthanna complex contains any material of ""military value.""

"Pope Francis has decided not to move into the papal apartment used by Benedict XVI and others before him, preferring instead to stay in a simple suite at a Vatican hotel, a Vatican spokesman said. The papal apartment on the top floor of the Apostolic Palace is ready for the new pontiff to move into, the Rev. Federico Lombardi told CNN on Tuesday. However, he has decided to stay at the Casa Santa Marta, the residence where he's been staying since the papal election two weeks ago, for the time being, Lombardi said. He's given no date for when he might move out of the two-room suite, Lombardi added. His presence at Casa Santa Marta, the residence near St. Peter's Basilica where all the cardinals stayed during the conclave, means Francis will continue to meet his fellow priests for Mass and other communal activities. New pope, old pope meet for lunch . Although he's not moved in to the apartment, Francis is using the Apostolic Palace, including offices in his papal apartments, to carry out his papal duties, such as holding meetings and audiences, Lombardi said. Francis, the first Jesuit to assume the papacy, has become widely known for his embrace of simplicity and humility since he became pope. He's spoken of his desire to see the Roman Catholic Church be a ""poor church, for the poor,"" and his sermons have focused on the need to look after the needy and sick, as well as the natural world. Break with tradition . The pope's decision to remain in Casa Santa Marta, at least for now, is in keeping with his track record. While serving as archbishop in Buenos Aires, he declined to live in the archbishop's palace, choosing instead to live in a simple apartment. He also passed on a chauffeured limousine, preferring to take the bus with ordinary people, and he cooked his own meals. He's also bringing this approach to the events of Holy Week, leading up to Easter. Behind closed doors, pope supported civil unions in Argentina . On Thursday, Francis will break with tradition by celebrating the Mass of the Lord's Supper, which includes the gesture of the washing of feet, at the Casal del Marmo youth detention center, the Vatican said last week. The service has in past years been held at the grand Basilica of St. John Lateran, the official seat of the bishop of Rome. ""In his ministry as Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Cardinal Bergoglio used to celebrate the Mass in a prison or hospital or hospice for the poor and marginalized,"" the Vatican said in a statement, using the name Francis used before he became pope. ""With this celebration at Casal del Marmo, Pope Francis will continue his custom, which is characterized by its humble context."" 5 things to know about the new pope .","Pope Francis has declined to move into the palatial papal apartment .

"A judge on Wednesday ordered that Ethan Couch -- who drove drunk and caused a crash, killing four people and injuring two -- go to a lock-down residential treatment facility. State District Judge Jean Boyd had already decided the Texas teenager would serve no jail time. He was sentenced last year to 10 years' probation. His story made national headlines after a witness claimed Couch was a victim of ""affluenza"" -- the product of wealthy, privileged parents who never set limits for the boy. That particular defense, however, played no part in the judge's decision, Couch's lawyer told reporters on Wednesday. Court proceedings were closed to the public. ""She (Boyd) said it (affluenza), and specifically mentioned that that was not a basis for her decision,"" said attorney Reagan Wynn. ""She heard all the evidence and she made what she thought was the appropriate disposition."" 'Affluenza' defense psychologist: 'I wish I hadn't used that term' The judge ordered that Couch's parents pay for the treatment facility, which was not identified. It was also unclear how long Couch might stay  there. As part of his probation, the teen must refrain from using drugs or alcohol. He will also not be allowed to drive. If Couch violates the terms of his probation, he could face up to 10 years behind bars. ""I think he can be rehabilitated given intensive therapy and I hope that he gets it,"" Wynn said about the teen. ""The juvenile system is about rehabilitation and if it's going to be about rehabilitation, she (Boyd) absolutely made the right decision."" Eric Boyles, who lost his wife and daughter in the crash, disagrees. He told reporters he has no doubt that money played a role in the case. Steering teen drivers out of harm's way . ""Had he (Couch) not had money to have the defense there, to also have the experts testify, and also offer to pay for the treatment, I think the results would have been different,"" he said Wednesday after the proceedings. Last June, his wife, Hollie Boyles, and daughter, Shelby, left their home to help Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had broken down. Brian Jennings, a youth pastor, was driving past and also stopped to help. All four were killed when the teen's pickup plowed into the pedestrians on a road in Burleson, south of Fort Worth. Couch's vehicle also struck a parked car, which then slid into another vehicle headed in the opposite direction. Opinion: 'Affluenza' isn't as crazy as it sounds . Two people riding in the bed of the teen's pickup were tossed in the crash and severely injured. One is no longer able to move or talk because of a brain injury, while the other suffered internal injuries and broken bones. According to prosecutors, three hours after the crash, tests showed Couch had a blood alcohol content of 0.24, three times the legal limit. ""There has been nothing from Ethan from these proceedings with regards to remorse on his part at all -- that I do think would have helped. It would have helped the victims. No doubt about it, it would have helped,"" said Boyles. Prosecutors were similarly disappointed with the judge's decision. They had asked for the maximum of 20 years behind bars. ""This has been a very frustrating experience for me,"" said prosecutor Richard Alpert. ""I'm used to a system where the victims have a voice and their needs are strongly considered. The way the system down here is currently handled, the way the law is, almost all the focus is on the offender.""

"U.S. Navy SEAL Team Six pulled out during a raid in Somalia to capture suspected Al-Shabaab leader Ikrima when it became clear that he couldn't be taken alive, a senior U.S. official told CNN. ""Their mission was to capture him. Once it became clear we were not going to (be) able to take him, the Navy commander made the decision to withdraw,"" said the official, who has direct knowledge of the entire Somalia operation but declined to be identified publicly. The official said the SEALs faced heavy opposition and an intense firefight broke out, leading to the withdrawal. The mission's aim -- to capture Ikrima -- is the reason the team went in rather than using a drone to attack the heavily guarded seaside villa, the official said. Another U.S. official told CNN the Navy SEALs reported seeing children at the compound, part of the reason the mission was stopped during the firefight. U.S. terror raids: 2 operations. 2 outcomes. 5 questions. Amid questions about the aborted mission, the Pentagon is disputing the suggestion that Al-Shabaab drove out the SEALs. ""That's not how it happened,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little insisted to CNN. ""There was a firefight, absolutely, and they took every step to avoid civilian casualties in this case, and that's what our military personnel do. They weigh these kinds of decisions and they made a prudent decision on the ground to depart. It was their decision."" Little said earlier that the United States will continue to work with Somalia's government to confront Al-Shabaab. ""While the operation did not result in Ikrima's capture, U.S. military personnel conducted the operation with unparalleled precision and demonstrated that the United States can put direct pressure on Al-Shabaab leadership at any time of our choosing,"" he said. Somalia welcomed the U.S. raid, Somali Deputy Prime Minister Fawzia Yusuf Adam told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday. ""We are welcoming more if this will help us ... get rid of al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab,"" said Adam, who is also the country's foreign minister. It was one of two U.S. military operations in Africa over the weekend targeting what officials called high-value terrorism suspects. In the other raid, members of the elite U.S. Army Delta Force captured Abu Anas al Libi, an al Qaeda operative wanted for his alleged role in the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa. U.S. target in Somalia: An inside story on an Al-Shabaab commander . Next stop, New York? The special operations forces took al Libi to a U.S. Navy warship after his capture, a U.S. official said. The Pentagon said the U.S. military was holding al Libi in a ""secure location"" outside Libya. There, a team of officials from the FBI, the CIA and other intelligence agencies are grilling him for intelligence on al Qaeda. His next stop could be the United States, where authorities have long wanted al Libi to stand trial in an American court for his alleged role in the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that left over 200 dead and thousands wounded. The Libyan interim government called the U.S. capture a kidnapping and wants an explanation from Washington, the country's state news agency reported Sunday. There's no extradition treaty between Libya and the United States. Opinion: Good thing U.S. terrorist hunters weren't furloughed . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry disputes that. He described al Libi as a key al Qaeda figure who is a ""legal and an appropriate target."" Kerry said Monday that al Libi ""will now have an opportunity to defend himself and to be appropriately brought to justice in a court of law."" A federal grand jury in New York has already indicted al Libi for the embassy attacks. State Department rules out Guantanamo . But trying terrorism suspects on American soil has been a controversial topic in the past. In 2009, Attorney General Eric Holder said five Guantanamo Bay detainees with alleged ties to the 9/11 attacks would be transferred to New York for trial in civilian court. Later Holder reversed course, announcing that accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others would be tried in a military commission at Guantanamo instead. Could al Libi face a similar fate? State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said Monday that there's no chance he could end up at Guantanamo. ""The administration's position on Guantanamo is clear. Our goal is not to add to the population, it's to reduce it, which we've done. ... Our policy is not to send any new detainees to Guantanamo,"" she said. Opinion: Has U.S. learned from past counter-terrorism mistakes in Africa? Concern grows over terrorism in region . The weekend attacks come as concern over terrorism in the region is on the rise after last month's deadly shopping mall attack in Kenya's capital. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack, which left at least 67 people dead. A U.S. official said Monday that the U.S. government is concerned about the al Qaeda-linked militant group's growing focus on external operations -- including the possibility of striking U.S. interests in the region. The Somalia operation was planned before the mall attack, the official said. Another source underlined that the raid was not in response to the mall attack, adding that the United States has been going after Al-Shabaab for some time, with SEALs and with drones.","U.S. official: Navy SEAL team reported seeing children at the Somalia compound .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- While Prime Minister David Cameron's speech this week -- voicing his intent to let the British people vote on whether to stay in the European Union -- has caused concern on the continent, the mayor of London says it's all part of democracy. ""I think if you ask most international business leaders, bankers whether they wanted to abolish elections to remove any element of uncertainty in the commercial world, well of course they would love to do that,"" Mayor Boris Johnson told CNN's Richard Quest at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, which he described as the ""cyclotron of egos."" ""You've got to consult the people from time to time, the British people haven't been consulted since 1975, the French have, the Dutch have, the Irish have -- now is the moment."" Cameron made headlines Wednesday by promising the British people a vote on European Union membership if he wins the next general election in 2015. Cameron told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that he has no regrets over the referendum promise, despite unhappiness among some European partners. ""It's really important that we've set out a plan for how we get change in Europe that will benefit all of Europe, making it more open, more competitive, more flexible, and how we secure Britain's place within that,"" he said. iReport: Do you think Britain should stay in the EU? The European Union is already changing to meet the needs of the 17 members who are part of the euro single currency, Cameron said. Britain is not in that group. After Cameron's speech on Wednesday, the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz tweeted: ""#Cameron's Europe a la carte not an option. We have to focus on jobs & growth rather than getting lost in treaties discussions."" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius used similar language in an interview on France Info radio saying Europe could not be ""a la carte,"" Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported. Cameron: We must focus on trade, taxes, transparency . Johnson believes any vote would result in Britain remaining in the EU. ""I think most people can see that the overwhelming likelihood, in fact the certainty, is that Britain one way or another will be part of the free trade zone,"" he said. Johnson also condemned attempts in Europe to build financial trading hubs away from London. Last month, the governor of the Banque de France told the Financial Times the City of London should be deposed as the euro's main financial center so the single currency club can ""control"" most financial business in the eurozone. ""All these thing come and go, of course it will always be and always has been a historic aim of the French in particular, other countries certainly, to try and chip away at the financial dominance of the city,"" Johnson told CNN. ""That is always going to be their objective and you have to forgive them for that, they are bound to use what bureaucratic tools they can to achieve those goals. They haven't succeeded I the past, I don't believe they will succeed,"" he added. ""I think the key reason is actually in the end most sensible people in other European capitals know that it is in their interest, in the interest of the EU, to have a massive global powerhouse in London rather than in Singapore or New York."" And what did London's mayor think of the World Economic Forum in Davos? ""It's all a bit intoxicating isn't it? It is this great cyclotron of egos isn't it, everybody is bumping into each other and having an enormous ghastly, nauseating, mutual feelings of self-regard,"" he said. ""But you know it is important, I never come away feeling without having met people that could put a lot of money into London, and that is generally what we achieve.""

"(CNN)If it hasn't happened already, it probably will at some point: the moment you don't like one of your child's friends. What do you do? I remember when I was growing up and my mom didn't love me spending time with one of the girls in our neighborhood. She didn't forbid me from being with her but didn't encourage our get-togethers, either. Eventually, I realized this friend wasn't the right fit for me for a host of reasons, and the relationship fizzled. Years later, I wondered: How did my mom know? Clinical psychologist Kirsten Cullen Sharma, co-director of the early childhood clinical service at the NYU Langone Medical Center's Child Study Center, says the first thing parents need to ask themselves is why they don't like one of their children's friends. ""Is it because they don't like that person's mom? Is it because that kid gets really good grades and it's easy for them and that person is a little narcissistic? Or is it something that is really serious that you're worried your child would model an unhealthy behavior?"" asked Cullen Sharma, who is also a clinical assistant professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the NYU School of Medicine. ""So I think parents need to understand why they have these feelings and where they're coming from."" Sometimes, it's not so easy to figure out. 'Brutally Honest': Mean girls are getting younger . When Rachel Matos' now-15-year-old son was in elementary school, he became friends with a boy who shared his interests in video games and sports. However, the friend was ""a lot 'older' for his age, used a lot of profanity and had quite a reputation for saying hurtful things to peers,"" said Matos, the photographer and writer behind the lifestyle blog The Art Muse. It was hard to be neutral, she said. She didn't want to judge too much and demand an end to the friendship, because that might have caused her son to lie about contact with his friend. Instead, Matos invited her son's friend to her home more to get to know him better and had several conversations with his parents, which helped a lot and made her see there was more to this friend than she initially realized. ""Turns out, this friend has actually grown into a very nice teenager, and they are still friends,"" said Matos, who is also a freelance writer in Pasadena, California, and an account executive for Latina Bloggers Connect, where she connects bloggers with brands. ""It's so hard to gauge these things,"" she said, because kids change so much over time. When you can't stand your kids' friend . Laura Beyer, a mom of two grown daughters, took a similar approach any time she didn't care for one of her girls' friends. ""I would figure out why and then befriend them,"" said Beyer, of West Allis, Wisconsin. ""The minute you get these kids to respect you, the less likely they are to disrespect you and the more likely they are to show you reasons why they are unlikeable."" Cullen Sharma, the psychologist, said that if a parent has a ""feeling"" every time their child spends time with another child they don't like, they should probably do something about the relationship. ""If it's something a parent is highly distressed about and they just believe and know that in their heart that this is not right ... then I think it's absolutely appropriate for parents to set limits on hanging out with kids who are 'bad influences' on their kids."" The warning signs of a damaging and dangerous friendship could include gossiping and bullying, use of alcohol and drugs, poor grades, cutting school and self-harm, she added. Chances are, your teen has sexted . Forbidding a friendship could backfire, but talking to your child during a calm moment, not in the middle of a power struggle, can help the child open up about the friendship and what he or she gets from that connection, experts say. Parenting advocate Sue Scheff, author of the book ""Wit's End: Advice and Resources for Saving Your Out-of-Control Teen,"" encourages parents to ask questions such as ""what do they have in common with their friend and what do they like to do together?"" ""I always tell parents it is best to have the conversations before confrontations take place,"" said Scheff. ""Staying calm, showing a genuine interest in their friends, even if you don't care for them, will show your child you are respecting him (or) her."" She added, ""Gradually, you have to point out that friends don't bring other friends down, especially if your child is slipping in their grades, getting in trouble, etc."" Awkward! The tough transition to middle school . As parents, we know the stakes can be high when our child befriends someone whom we believe could be a danger. Recent surveys quantify how damaging those friendships can be. Teens with friends who do drugs and drink alcohol are more likely to do the same, according to a 2011 survey sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institutes of Health. A survey by ParentFurther.com found that only 10% of teens said they had not been influenced by peer pressure and 46% of teens said they teased somebody because their friends were teasing that person. Scheff, who works with parents of teens who are engaging in high risk behaviors, said there is another side to this issue: Sometimes your own child is the problem, and that is not so easy to accept. ""If your child is hanging with a less than desirable crowd, your child might be part of things you don't want to face either but need to,"" said Scheff. ""It is so frustrating when parents say, 'Not my child. It's his friends.' "" What would you do if you didn't like one of your child's friends?

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN) -- The head of Airbus says the European aviation giant will take care to learn from its own mistakes -- and rival Boeing's -- ahead of the launch of its new widebody A350 aircraft. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday, Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier told CNN's Richard Quest that teething problems with the company's own A380 superjumbo -- which suffered from cracks in brackets inside the wings -- had proven instructive. ""We drew all the possible lessons from the A380,"" he said. ""Sometimes we went too far on outsourcing work. We need to make sure we control the architecture of the aircraft so as to have the safest and best aircraft."" Successful development of new aircraft required ""full transparency from our team,"" he said. ""We also need to control some functions."" Airbus' A380 headaches have been overshadowed in recent times by main rival Boeing's troubled launch of its 787 Dreamliner. All 50 Dreamliners in service around the world were grounded earlier this month after advanced lithium ion batteries on two planes ignited, prompting a Federal Aviation Administration investigation. Read more: How Boeing can bounce back from Dreamliner problems . Like the Dreamliner, the A350 will be Airbus's first model to have its fuselage and wings primarily made of lightweight composite materials, and will also use lithium ion batteries, although from a different supplier. Bregier said the A350's design would be ""a very robust one,"" which would take into account any potential lessons to be learned from the Dreamliner's problems. ""If by chance there is a decision regarding the 787 which would impact us, we would of course embark on that. And we have plenty of time,"" he said. The A350 is scheduled to make its first flight in mid- 2013, with deliveries due to customers the following year.","Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier says the company has learned from the troubled A350 launch .

"It was the embrace that melted hearts worldwide. Pope Francis, pausing for a moment to pray and lay his hands on a man with a disfiguring disease. The man gently burying his head in the Pope's chest, his many facial tumors visible. His encounter with the ailing man occurred in Vatican City on Wednesday at the end of the general audience, which had about 50,000 attendees. Images of the Pope's embrace in St. Peter's Square went viral on social media. ""I'm an atheist, but the more I hear about Pope Francis, the more I like him,"" Donna Hosie tweeted. Some say Pope Francis is living up to the ideals of his namesake, Francis of Assisi, a preeminent figure who considered himself a servant to the poor and destitute. Why the Pope's embrace is so powerful . Since taking over as the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, the Pope has highlighted the need to reach out to the poor and afflicted. ""Lord, teach us to step outside ourselves,"" he tweeted in August.  ""Teach us to go out into the streets and manifest your love."" A month later, he echoed the same sentiment. ""True charity requires courage: let us overcome the fear of getting our hands dirty so as to help those in need,"" he tweeted. The Pope has called for open interaction with people from all walks of life, especially the poor, weak and vulnerable. And he is practicing what he preaches. The man the Pope comforted suffers from neurofibromatosis, according to the Catholic News Agency. The genetic disorder causes pain and thousands of tumors throughout the body. It leads to hearing and vision loss, heart and blood vessel complications, and severe disability from nerve compression by tumors. The moment marked the latest in a series of memorable encounters for the Pope. Last month, a pint-sized papal pal joined him on stage -- and refused to let go.","His encounter with man occurs at end of general audience .

"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel cannot negotiate with the government of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas while it is backed by Hamas. ""I call on President Abbas: Tear up your pact with Hamas,"" Netanyahu said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""We're not going to negotiate with a government backed by Hamas unless Hamas changes its position and says it's willing to recognize Israel,"" he said. Netanyahu's comments come four days after the Abbas-led Palestinian movement Fatah, which controls the West Bank and dominates the Palestinian Authority, said it would attempt to form a unity government with Hamas, the militant Islamic group that controls Gaza. Hamas hasn't recognized Israel's right to exist, and Israel canceled scheduled peace talks after Wednesday's announcement. Netanyahu said that if Israel cannot reach peace with Palestinians through an agreement, ""we'll seek other ways"" to achieve peace. ""I'm not going to accept a stalemate,"" he said. But Palestinian lawmaker Hanan Ashrawi swiftly criticized Netanyahu's ""extremely cynical"" declaration. Ashrawi accused the Israeli leader of trying to torpedo the peace process by expanding Israeli settlements in the West Bank, where most of a projected Palestinian state would be located, and maintaining the Israeli blockade of Gaza. ""He did everything possible to undermine the talks, and now he is using the pretext of reunification in order to say 'You don't qualify,'"" Ashrawi said. She dismissed Netanyahu's assertion that he remained interested in a settlement of the decades-old conflict as ""lip service."" ""We judge by his actions,"" she said. ""He has been systematically dismantling the process, systematically destroying its very foundations and systematically destroying the very objective, which is a two-state solution, by stealing the land of the Palestinian state. Very simply, if he is serious then he will act in a way that will demonstrate his seriousness."" In the interview Sunday, Netanyahu praised the efforts of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry over the past nine months, saying the United States has been ""indispensable"" in pushing for peace. ""I appreciate Secretary Kerry's unbelievable efforts,"" he said. ""They don't always succeed -- unfortunately, President Abbas made sure of that by embracing Hamas. But I have to credit John Kerry for his efforts."" Netanyahu also voiced skepticism over comments by Abbas released Sunday in which the Palestinian leader called the Holocaust the most heinous crime in modern human history. Abbas ""can't have it both ways,"" by calling the Holocaust the most heinous crime in modern history while embracing Hamas, a ""terrorist organization that openly denies the Holocaust,"" Netanyahu said. He suggested Abbas' remarks, released by his office, were an attempt to placate Western public opinion in the wake of Fatah's step toward Hamas. The Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank have been run separately for seven years. The split began taking shape in 2006 when Hamas, participating in Palestinian polls for the first time, won a majority in the Palestinian parliament. The Palestinian Authority formed a coalition government with Hamas that year, with Abbas retaining the presidency and Hamas member Ismail Haniya becoming prime minister. But when Abbas dissolved the government in 2007, Hamas seized control of Gaza, and Haniya became Gaza's de facto political leader. The West for years has shown support to Fatah and warned it not to join hands with militant Hamas, which several countries, including the United States, have deemed a terrorist organization.","Netanyahu was never serious about peace talks, Palestinian official says .

"An Italian appeals court convicted former exchange student Amanda Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito on murder charges Thursday night. Prosecutors said the couple had killed Meredith Kercher in November 2007. They were convicted two years later of murder, but those charges were overturned on appeal in 2011. A judge said Thursday that Knox, also convicted of slander, was sentenced in absentia to  28 1/2 years in prison. Sollecito's sentence was 25 years. Knox, who was at home in Seattle, Washington, said her conviction would bring no consolation to the Kercher family. ""I am frightened and saddened by this unjust verdict,"" she said in written remarks. ""Having been found innocent before, I expected better from the Italian justice system. The evidence and accusatory theory do not justify a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ...There has always been a marked lack of evidence."" She called the legal proceedings a travesty. ""This has gotten out of hand. Most troubling is that it was entirely preventable,"" she said. ""I beseech those with the knowledge and authority to address and remediate the problems that worked to pervert the course of justice and waste the valuable resources of the system."" Knox also said that Kercher's family had suffered greatly. ""Their grief over Meredith's terrible murder will follow them forever. They deserve respect and support."" What comes next . Presiding Judge Alessandro Nencini has 90 days to write his arguments behind the jury's ruling. Once that is out, lawyers have 90 days to appeal. Knox's attorney, Ted Simon, said there will certainly be an appeal and cautioned that extradition shouldn't yet be a part of the conversation surrounding the case. ""It's really not in play right now, because first of all, she has another appeal to the Supreme Court of Italy,"" he told CNN's  Anderson Cooper 360. ""In Italy, under their system, you're still actually presumed innocent until that third, final stage."" Simon said that if extradition does become an issue, Knox has ""very substantial defenses"" that can be used. ""But I think we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves,"" he told CNN. ""The bottom line is, there is no evidence. There was no evidence, and there never will be any evidence, and that's why this is such a gross miscarriage of justice."" Legal analysts debated whether the U.S. would send Knox back to Italy if Rome requests extradition. It is unlikely that Knox will return to Italy to serve additional prison time because U.S. law dictates that a person cannot be tried twice on the same charge, a legal expert told CNN. ""She was once put in jeopardy and later acquitted,"" said Sean Casey, a former prosecutor who is now a partner at Kobre & Kim in New York. ""Under the treaty (between the two nations), extradition should not be granted."" CNN legal analyst Mark O'Mara said that the United States has to respect the treaty. ""We have to follow the letter of the law,"" he said Thursday. Knox says she won't go back . Kercher, 21, of Great Britain, was found partially nude in a pool of blood in the house she shared with Knox in the picturesque town of Perugia, where both women were exchange students. Knox has said she is afraid to return to Italy, where she spent four years behind bars. ""I will become ... a fugitive,"" she told Italian daily La Repubblica this month, when asked what she would do if she was found guilty in the second trial. Italy's Supreme Court in March overturned the pair's acquittals, saying that the jury did not consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered. The case was sent to a retrial in Florence. Amanda Knox retrial verdict: Six things to know . Ruling unclear . The retrial began in September, refocusing international attention on the case that grabbed headlines in Italy, Britain and the United States -- but neither Knox nor Sollecito were present in court. Both Knox and Sollecito have maintained their innocence. Timeline: Kercher murder case . 'Fugitive' Knox, 26, and Sollecito, 29, were convicted in 2009 of killing Kercher, who was found with more than 40 stab wounds and a deep gash in her throat. Speaking on Thursday, Knox's defense team asked for an acquittal. Knox has always denied murdering Kercher and has maintained she is not guilty in a written statement to the Florence court. ""I must repeat to you. I'm innocent. I did not rape, I did not steal ... I did not kill Meredith,"" Knox said in a lengthy e-mail presented by her lawyer to the court in December. Sollecito was in the Dominican Republic at the start of the retrial but returned to Italy. In November, he took to the stand to make a spontaneous declaration, saying the charges against him were ""absurd."" ""For me, it's a nightmare that goes beyond imagination,"" he said of what he's been through. 'No one remembers Meredith' ""They are tired of this long trial and they want justice,"" Francesci Maresca, attorney for the Kercher family, said. The Kercher family welcomed the retrial ruling, Maresca said in March, adding they believed the ruling that acquitted Knox and Sollecito was ""superficial and unbalanced."" They believe more than one person was in the room when Kercher was killed, he said. ""No one remembers Meredith, while the two defendants write books, speak to the media and earn money,"" Maresca told the court in closing remarks last month.

"(CNN)Eddie Redmayne, congratulations! You've won an Oscar! Now you'd better watch out. If there is such a thing as an ""Oscar curse"" -- that malady that suddenly grips some Oscar winners, plunging their once-bright careers into ""Aeon Flux""-like darkness -- best actor winner Redmayne could be a likely victim. Among the newly anointed crop of Oscar recipients, the ""Theory of Everything"" star would be right to be wary. He's young -- just 33 -- and could just as easily aim for big-budget movie stardom as chewy character roles. A few more films like ""Jupiter Ascending,"" the current Wachowski siblings' bomb that features Redmayne in a major role, and he may be the answer to Oscar trivia questions in 2025. Sunday's other acting winners may not have the same challenges. J.K. Simmons, who won best supporting actor for ""Whiplash,"" has been a character mainstay for years; he might start getting bigger billing, but the work should remain steady. Best actress winner Julianne Moore (""Still Alice"") is an established star and is probably at little risk of going off the rails. And Patricia Arquette, the best supporting actress winner for ""Boyhood,"" has made a career of combining intriguing film choices with steady TV work. Indeed, she's the star of ""CSI: Cyber,"" which debuts March 4. Now, ""curse"" might be a little strong. Some performers such as Mercedes Ruehl (""The Fisher King"") or F. Murray Abraham (""Amadeus"") were character types who hit it big. It would be unlikely for them to suddenly become successful headliners. Other actors prefer to pick interesting roles in small, quirky movies rather than let Hollywood's box-office machinery pigeonhole them. On the other hand, there are any number of ""it"" performers -- especially actresses such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Renee Zellweger and Halle Berry -- who had youth, looks and chops and were pegged as future leads. But whether through poor script choices, fickle audiences or movie-industry biases, their follow-ups tanked. (Many of the entries on this list seem to be less the victim of a ""curse"" than industry preconceptions about women's roles.) Certainly the Oscar is a wonderful honor, a permanent prefix to an actor's name. But some may wonder if all the red-carpet scrutiny and stress was worth it. Check out the gallery for a few examples.","An ""Oscar curse"" seems to plague some Academy Award winners .

"Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should heed U.S. warnings to neither use nor move chemical or biological weapons, lest he risk crossing a ""red line"" and provoke a U.S. military response, President Barack Obama said Monday. ""We cannot have a situation where chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. ""We have been very clear to the Assad regime -- but also to other players on the ground -- that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. ""That would change my calculus; that would change my equation."" Obama added that U.S. officials are monitoring the situation ""very carefully"" and have put together a number of contingency plans. Saudi support for Syrian rebels shaped by tribal, religious ties . ""We have communicated in no uncertain terms with every player in the region that that's a red line for us and that there would be enormous consequences if we start seeing movement on the chemical weapons front or the use of chemical weapons."" Obama's remarks appeared to ratchet up his stance on the matter. Last month, talking about Syrian forces, he told a VFW convention, ""They will be held accountable by the international community and the United States should they make the tragic mistake of using those weapons."" The Syrian regime ""probably has the largest and most advanced chemical warfare program in the Arab world,"" Michael Eisenstadt, director of the military and security studies program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told CNN last month. It includes ""thousands of tube and rocket artillery rounds filled with mustard-type blister agents, thousands of bombs filled with the nerve agents sarin and possibly VX, and binary-type and cluster CW warheads filled with nerve agents for all its major missile systems. ""Its CW infrastructure is believed to include several production facilities and numerous storage sites, mostly dispersed throughout the western half of the country,"" Eisenstadt said. Syria is thought to have a biological warfare research and development program, but is not known to have offensive biological warfare agents, Eisenstadt said. The nation is not a party to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. That's the body of the Chemical Weapons Convention dedicated to eliminating the weapons. Israeli President Shimon Peres has said his country too is preparing contingency plans to attack Syria's chemical weapons arsenal if Israel is directly threatened. In September 2007, Israeli jets bombed a building in Syria that the U.N. nuclear agency eventually concluded was ""very likely a nuclear reactor."" Obama's warning on Monday came as Muslims in Syria celebrated the second of three days of feasting to honor the end of the holy month of Ramadan, with the holiday's message of amity and tolerance contrasting sharply with reality. U.N. observer mission in Syria ends, violence continues . At least 150 people were killed Monday, including two children and their mother in Daraa, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. A Japanese journalist was killed during a gun battle in Aleppo, the Japanese foreign ministry said Tuesday. Mika Yamamoto, 45, worked for the independent Japan Press news agency and had been reporting on the Free Syrian Army. Her body was taken to Turkey, where officials were working to get more information, the ministry said. Also among the dead in Syria were 10 bodies discovered splayed on the ground in the Damascus suburb of Qaboun. Video posted by activists showed at least one of the victims lying on his back, blindfolded, his arms stretched above his head. Others showed victims with bruised flesh and dark red splotches on their clothes. CNN cannot authenticate the video. Another video, said to have been shot Sunday in the town of Talbeesa, north of Homs, showed children being pushed on swings. The swings are attached to the gun of a tank on which adults are standing, chanting, ""Victory for the rebels!"" In a third video, showing the same tank, a man says to the camera, ""We will enter Homs with this tank and liberate all of Syria, God willing!"" Daraa province, where the conflict began in March 2011 as peaceful anti-government demonstrations, has suffered heightened violence in recent days. It is also the home province of Vice President Farouq al-Sharaa, who rebels say has defected from the regime. On Sunday, the charred bodies of 20 people were discovered in the Daraa city of Hirak, and 31 other people were killed in the province, the LCC said. Government forces executed 14 people in Daraa hours after they were detained, the opposition network said. Hirak took another beating Monday, when mortars and rockets rained down on the city, the LCC said. Inside Syria: Nobody imagined it would turn into this .

"The Syrian civil war has birthed rebel groups across a wide ideological and geographic spectrum. Some are nationalists bent on liberating their country from a ruthless regime.  Others view the conflict as a springboard to a global jihad. A number are active only in their home province, while others are present throughout the country. A closer look at Syrian rebel units illustrates the balance of forces on the battlefield. In examining these groups, it is clear that those allied with the United States have become increasingly marginalized by jihadists and Salafists, who are the most powerful players in the revolution. The Free Syrian Army . The Free Syrian Army (FSA) was created by Col. Riyad al-Asad in July 2011 and is supported by Western nations.  Today it is led by Gen. Salim Idriss. More a loosely linked umbrella organization than a cohesive fighting force with a hierarchical chain of command, the organization welcomes everyone. In December 2012, donor nations brokered the creation of a Supreme Military Council (SMC), hoping it could unify the disparate ranks, but it has failed to do so. Syrian-based commanders remain disobedient, illustrating the tenuous influence of exiled FSA leaders. These officers, located in Jordan and Turkey, are nationalists who emphasize respecting the rights of all Syrians. Local leaders inside Syria are far less tolerant. After meeting with Idriss in May, U.S. Sen. John McCain issued a statement: ""General Idriss and his fighters share many of our interests and values."" Washington has provided nonlethal aid, but promised weapons have not materialized. The FSA is active in every Syrian province and reportedly has 80,000 men under Idriss' control. Nevertheless, the FSA is plagued by a high level of attrition. Fighters seeking a more cohesive structure and stronger ideology desert to Islamist units. Others leave for better-funded brigades. Moderate Islamists . Moderate Islamist groups identify with the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood. These groups aspire to replace the secular canon with Islamic law, curtail individual freedoms, and subordinate minorities. They have coalesced around the Syrian Islamic Liberation Front (SILF), a 19-faction alliance established in September 2012, whose leader boasted it has more than 40,000 fighters. It comprises some of the largest units in Syria, including the Tawhid Brigade, the most powerful group in the northern province of Aleppo. In Damascus, the coalition's key group is Liwa al-Islam. It has captured sophisticated surface-to-air missiles. The SILF also includes the Faruq Brigades, a dominant unit in the central province of Homs. One of its members made headlines when a video surfaced of him eating an organ of a regime soldier. Moderate Islamists cooperate with the FSA and participate in joint operations. They communicate with Western governments but receive no aid from them. Salafists . Salafists are puritanical Muslims who seek to return the Islamic community to the first three generations following its birth. They shun modernism and Western influence, and espouse a literalist and uncompromising reading of canonical texts. They have promoted a vitriolic sectarian discourse depicting the ruling Alawi minority as heretics meriting death, and have targeted Alawi civilians. Eleven Salafist groups joined forces in December 2012 to create the Syrian Islamic Front (SIF). They include Ahrar al-Sham -- one of the most powerful rebel brigades, active in several provinces from Latakia to al-Raqqa; and al-Haqq Brigade in Homs. Members say the organization has more than 30,000 fighters, including some foreigners, but mostly Syrians. The SIF has shunned suicide bombing but uses car bombs to target regime forces. Though its platform is vague, it constantly references the integral role of Islam in Syria's future, but declares ""our course is the centrist and moderate course, far from exceeding the proper bounds of religion."" As proof, it offers ambiguous assurances to minorities. The SIF asserts that its conflict is limited to Syria. Salafist brigades cooperate with all other rebel units. They work with Western journalists but eschew their governments. Jihadists . Though jihadists associated with al-Qaeda were latecomers, they are now the most powerful groups on the battlefield.  Jabhat al-Nusra was created in January 2012. The group was composed of Syrians who fought in Iraq while it was under American rule. Jabhat al-Nusra pioneered the use of suicide bombing, targeting both civilian and military targets. In April, al-Qaeda's Iraqi affiliate created a new organization called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). It quickly absorbed many Jabhat al-Nusra units. ISIS has a presence in almost every Syrian province. The Emigrants and Helpers Army, another jihadist group, is led by Abu Umar the Chechnyan. Its members are largely drawn from the Caucasus region. American intelligence organizations believe there are more than 6,000 foreign jihadists, including Westerners, in Syria.  They have killed Alawi civilians, kidnapped Westerners and attacked other brigades. They control key infrastructure, such as dams and oil installations. ISIS wants to use the Syrian conflict as a platform to destabilize neighboring countries. As jihadists grow in strength, they have sidelined other brigades, and captured their bases and weapons.  Nevertheless, they cooperate with rebel groups across the ideological spectrum. FSA criminal outfits . As consolidation occurs within the rebel ranks, Free Syrian Army units that dabble in criminal activity are increasingly being squeezed. In Aleppo, smugglers created the Asifa al-Shamal Brigade. The group  earned hefty fees controlling the Bab al-Salama border crossing. But its criminal activities led other units to break up its monopoly. Recently it was forced to relinquish partial control of Bab al-Salama, and ISIS has taken over many of its checkpoints. The Aleppo-based Ghuraba al-Sham, another brigade whose leaders have criminal roots, has seen a similar decline. As the FSA has lost ground, jihadists and Salafists have gradually become the most important actors in the Syrian revolution. And an American strike against the regime will only make them stronger.","Barak Barfi: Syria's civil war has spawned rebel groups across wide spectrum of ideology .

"(CNN)Talk of American exceptionalism has become headline news, with loud sputtering from Rudy Giuliani, who suggested that President Barack Obama doesn't love America in the same way that the rest of us do. Giuliani wants to dwell on our exceptionalism -- the idea that we're different from other countries, and much better. It's an old idea that Obama took on in the second year of his presidency, when he said:  ""I believe in American exceptionalism, just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism."" That comment annoyed those who wished him to say: ""America is the best country in the world, bar none!"" Somehow the drumbeat for exceptionalism continues. This month, Oklahoma politician Dan Fisher introduced a bill that tried to ban Advanced Placement history classes in his state because the guidelines for teachers didn't talk explicitly about American exceptionalism. The bill passed the House Education Committee in his state by a 11-4 vote but has since been pulled back for a rewrite, the Tulsa World reported last week. Still, it's part of a battle that has heated up around the country.  Indeed, six states have introduced bills to change the framework of AP history courses to emphasize the idea of exceptionalism and downplay aspects of American history that don't seem, well, exceptional. Scholars have studied the concept thoroughly, and one of the best books on this topic is by Seymour Martin Lipset:  ""American Exceptionalism:  A Double-Edged Sword"" (Norton, 1996).  Lipset identifies five features central to the American value system:  liberty, egalitarianism, populism, individualism and laissez-faire. He suggests that we look at most trends in American history through the prism of these concepts, and to an extent this is a useful exercise. The United States is truly remarkable, a nation founded on a set of Enlightenment ideals so beautifully expressed by the Declaration of Independence and codified in the U.S. Constitution.  We should feel good about our ideals, even when we don't quite manage to live up to them. We are a nation of immigrants, a quilt of many colors, and we've managed over more than two centuries to create a way of life that allows for a reasonable degree of upward mobility, that prizes individual liberty, promotes freedom of religion and genuinely values equal rights for all citizens. At certain times in history -- World War II is a fine example -- we have joined forces with those on the side of freedom, willingly sacrificing our young men and women in a war that secured the defeat of fascism. Yet our history is, like every national story, a complicated one, and American students deserve a balanced view.  Should we really ignore the fact that Native Americans died in massive numbers (mostly from diseases carried to these shores by the earliest European invaders)?  In the 19th century, the West was ""won"" at considerable expense to those who actually lived on the land. Students need to know about the Trail of Tears, Wounded Knee and other sad episodes in American history. This is part of our story. We need to talk openly about slavery. In doing so, it's useful to look at the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database and see that more than 12 million Africans were kidnapped and shipped to the New World between the 16th and 19th centuries. The vast bulk of slaves, in fact, went to the Caribbean and South America. The Harvard scholar, Henry Louis Gates Jr., has written honestly about this. Of course slavery, wherever it occurred, was a brutal system, and it set in motion a great deal of bad karma, not helped by the sad period after Reconstruction ended in 1877, when an impoverished South put into effect Jim Crow laws that effectively subjugated blacks for many decades, creating a segregated society that -- to a degree -- continues to plague us. (I recommend Eric Foner's history of this era, ""Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution."") But the United States has worked hard to recognize and right its wrongs, passing major legislation on civil rights over the years, and we continue to work at this problem. It's a long and winding road, as the Beatles might have put it. As for America's military adventures, there are lots of wrinkles. The American Revolution is an inspiring moment, well worth dwelling on with students. But the Mexican-American War was a disgrace, ""one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation,"" as President U.S. Grant said in his memoirs.  It was this war that (in part) caused Henry David Thoreau to refuse to pay his taxes. World War II may have been an American triumph of will and courage, but the Korean War is confusing, and students should consider its odd dimensions. Vietnam and Iraq are also complicated, and yet it's important for students to know that our interventions in both countries led to a great deal of death and destruction.  At the very least, 133,000 Iraqi civilians died as a result of our ""war of choice"" in Iraq. This number should never be forgotten, as it set in motion a wave of violence that continues to this day, and it helps to explain anti-American feeling in that region. The war in Afghanistan is ongoing, and it may take decades to know what happened there and why and whether or not it was worth the effort. But it surely doesn't help anyone to push these questions under the rug. Obama loves the United States, and he upholds its values proudly. He speaks about its history in clear, rational terms, without pumping up the good side or trying to erase the darker sides. We should never forget that Americans continue to advocate for individual liberty, equality and self-governance.  We often step in when it's necessary to help countries in need. But our history needs no whitewashing. To attempt this does us a terrible disservice. American politicians who dwell on American exceptionalism only dishonor us by suggesting we play dumb to our past.","Jay Parini: Giuliani, Oklahoma AP history issue have put focus on American exceptionalism .

"(CNN)I simply couldn't believe my eyes. At a children's party this year, I witnessed full-on ""mean girl"" behavior. I can't say more because I don't want to single out any children but I can tell you how horrified I was to watch this and realize these kids were still in elementary school. I know I'm one of the lucky ones, and have written about how I didn't meet my first mean girl until college. But isn't the whole ""mean girl"" thing not supposed to rear its ugly head until middle school or beyond? Not anymore. Rosalind Wiseman, author of the New York Times bestseller ""Queenbees and Wannabes,"" which was the basis for the movie ""Mean Girls,"" believes we are seeing mean girl behavior at younger ages. She chalks it up to two reasons: girls starting to go through puberty earlier, on average as young as 9, and girls modeling what they see on television and in movies. ""Mainstream media is portraying girls at younger ages who are mimicking the worst of obnoxious, stereotypical girl behavior ... rolling eyes, moving the hips around, being catty,"" said Wiseman. ""So what girls are getting is that by 8 or 9, this is sort of a 'normal' way to act."" In fact, research shows that the more girls watch TV shows with socially aggressive female characters, the more likely they are to model that behavior in their own classroom. A study, conducted by Nicole Martins, an assistant professor of telecommunications at The Media School at Indiana University, found that 92% of 150 shows popular with children included some form of relational or social aggression. The aggressive behavior was often carried out by the physically attractive female characters. Think Hannah Montana or Sam on iCarly. After taking into account factors that could influence television viewing and aggression, such as socio-economic background and academic success, Martins and her co-author found a significant relationship for girls but not for boys between watching these shows and taking on socially aggressive behaviors. ""With girls, the more they watched, the more likely they were to perpetuate these behaviors so there's something about the nature of this type of behavior that girls feel comfortable perpetuating,"" said Martins. ""I've argued, and many others have argued, that it's really about socialization, that as a culture, we tend to condone physical aggression with boys, and say, 'Oh that's just the way boys are' but with girls, we tell them not to do that because that's not what girls do."" OPINION: Are women just mean or stating the facts? So what's the message to our girls about what they can and should do when they get angry? ""Girls have essentially been taught at a young age to be sneaky about it and this is what we are seeing in the shows that we are watching,"" said Martins. 'Boys are easy, girls are hard' In our own conversations, we should also be mindful about how we're feeding into the stereotypes about girls and boys, said Wiseman, whose latest book ""Masterminds and Wingmen"" focuses on how boys have to deal with ""mean boys"" too. ""We say boys are easy and girls are hard, girls are back-stabbing, nasty, all that kind of stuff, and what that means is we're basically saying, 'Well, your legacy, girls, is to grow up and be back-stabbing and not have women or girls that you can trust as friends.' "" Instead, Wiseman said we should be telling our girls that they deserve to go through adolescence and adulthood with very strong female relationships, understanding that they will get into conflicts and that people will be mean to them at times, but being able to advocate for themselves when that happens. ""Here's what I say to parents: You cannot prevent conflict. You cannot prevent all mean girl problems that your daughter is going to have. You cannot. What you can do is teach your child that conflict is inevitable and they need to learn how to manage that."" What we also need to teach our girls, said Michelle Anthony, co-author of ""Little Girls Can Be Mean,"" is that a ""certain kind and amount of meanness"" is OK. What she means by that is we want our girls to have a sense of ""agency and power"" especially going into the teenage years. ""So trying out meanness is not something we can or should eradicate,"" said Anthony. ""It's normal to want to feel powerful and to exert influence on your environment. It's healthy. What is unhealthy is when the means by which a child does that is at the social expense of another."" The takeaway for parents, she said, is helping girls understand the normal and healthy part of power-seeking while at the same time helping them realize the best means to achieve their goals without hurting others in the process. 'Mean moms' And yes, parents, our kids learn by example. ""The more meanness they see being successful or rewarded in the home or in their environment, the more children will revert to those mean behaviors themselves when faced with challenging social situations,"" said Anthony. So if we are snarky about another woman in person, behind her back or on Facebook, our girls are getting the message that that's an OK way to treat other girls. ""We talk about role modeling but very rarely do adults look at their own behavior and say 'What am I doing?' "" said Wiseman. Wiseman also said it's not just what we say and do, but what we watch that sends a message to our daughters. WATCH: The puberty ad you'll want to show all girls and boys . She brings up the popularity of the ""Real Housewives"" reality show series and how some women call watching the shows their ""guilty pleasure."" Your daughter ""walks in the house and sees that's what you entertain yourself with is watching other women be mean to each other or be ridiculed or dismissed,"" said Wiseman. ""You are showing that that's entertaining to you and then it normalizes it."" ""So those kinds of guilty pleasures have way bigger consequences than you just sitting down and watching that show.""

"(CNN)In airport surveillance pictures, the three young women look like typical travelers. But their destination was anything but ordinary. British police announced last week that three east London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- had flown aboard a Turkish Airlines plane from London's Gatwick Airport to Istanbul on February 17. From there, they wanted to go to Syria with the apparent goal of joining ISIS. On Tuesday, authorities said they believe the three girls have made it to their target country. British Prime Minister David Cameron has said the case highlights the need to fight ISIS on multiple fronts. ""It does make a broader point, which is the fight against Islamist terror is not just one that we can wage by the police and border control,"" he said. ""It needs every school, every university, every college, every community to recognize they have a role to play, we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult."" Here's a closer look at three teens and their families: . Shamima's family released a statement through London's Metropolitan Police, begging the girl to reach out and reconsider. ""Syria is a dangerous place, and we don't want you to go there. Get in touch with the police, and they will help to bring you home. You are not in any trouble."" The family said it understands that Shamima has strong feelings about wanting to help those she believes are suffering in Syria. ""You can help from home, you don't have to put yourself in danger,"" the statement reads. ""Please don't cross the border. Please come home to us. Our Mum needs you home and is really worried. We are not mad at you, we love you."" Shamima's sister, Renu Begum, described the 15-year-old as an ""A-star student."" But even bright, promising children can fall prey. ""To convince such young girls at that age that are so vulnerable ... it's just wrong,"" Begum said. ""It's a really evil thing to do. You're breaking up entire families."" Kadiza's sister, Halima Khanom, spoke to the BBC. She said everyone in her family is hurting and wants to know whether Kadiza is safe. ""We want you to know that we all miss you and we love you,"" Khanom said in a video message directed at her sister. ""Find the courage in your heart to contact us and let us know that you're safe and you're OK. That is all we ask of you."" Amira Abase told her father that she was going to a wedding. Her family reported her missing when she did not return. ""What she's doing is completely nonsense,"" Amira's father, Abase Hussen, said. He implored Amira to come home. ""Remember how we love you. Your sister, brother, they cannot stop crying."" Separately, Hussen spoke to the BBC. While holding a teddy bear that Amira had given her mother for Mother's Day, he said his daughter had never expressed an interest in ISIS. ""The message we have for Amira is to get back home. We miss you,"" Hussen told the BBC. ""Please think twice."" What is ISIS' appeal for young people?

"Atlanta (CNN)From bad to worse. The boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina Brown, who is fighting for her life at an Atlanta hospital, unleashed against her family Monday on Twitter, defending his actions and accusing her father of wanting her money. Brown is the daughter of R&B singer Bobby Brown and the late star Whitney Houston. ""Bobby seen his daughter 4 times in the last 5 yrs,"" Nick Gordon tweeted. ""Now him and his family want Whitneys $$$."" Gordon has said he's been prevented from visiting Brown in the hospital -- an accusation her father has denied. ""Let me be very clear, Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit,"" Bobby Brown said in a statement through his lawyers. ""Obviously Mr. Gordon is not as desperate to visit Bobbi Kristina as he wants the world to believe."" The statement did not specify what the terms were. Without specifying the details of those terms, Gordon's lawyers said they advised him against meeting them, ""particularly in light of Mr. Brown's inability to guarantee access."" ""In an effort to do all he can to visit, Nick has repeatedly offered to meet with Mr. Brown privately to discuss his request in person, rather than through lawyers,"" lawyers Randall M. Kessler and Joe S. Habachy said in a statement. ""Those offers have also been rejected. We hope Mr. Brown has a change of heart."" Bobby Brown's attorney responded with another statement, saying Gordon has yet to tell Brown in writing what happened to his daughter. Bobbi Kristina Brown, 21, remains in a medically induced coma at Emory University Hosital more than three weeks after she was found unresponsive in a bathtub. Police have said they're treating her case as a criminal investigation after she was found on January 31 at her home in Roswell, Georgia. The extent of her injuries is not known. Her mother, who died in 2012, was similarly found in a bathtub. A coroner ruled Houston's death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors.

"Spain, one of the eurozone's economic giants, is widely expected to become the bloc's next victim of the debt crisis. The eurozone's fourth-largest economy appears headed toward a sovereign bailout, market watchers say. The question now is when. Spain faces regional dissent ahead of local elections, 20 billion euros ($25 billion) in debt repayments this month, violent protests on the street, savage budget cuts and devastating unemployment rates. Analysts and economists canvassed by CNN say the issue is whether the country can survive the near term challenges or be forced to seek assistance within weeks. Spain has tried to stem its crisis with a tough budget and an audit on its banking needs. But its efforts face headwinds including pressure from the markets and contagion from frail eurozone members such as Greece and Portugal. Crisis in-depth . According to Ralph Silva, director of Silva Research Network: ""Spain is not 100% in control of its own destiny."" Daiwa Capital Markets economist Tobias Blattner believes the upcoming vote for independence in Catalonia -- the country's most fractious region -- could tip Spain into seeking a bailout. He expects the Spanish government to request external help between October 21 and November 25, when local elections will take place. Blattner noted: ""Market pressure is likely to rise ahead of the vote for independence in Catalonia as uncertainty over Spain's political cohesion will surge."" But Silva believes Spain will be able to hold out until January, despite the regional bickering. He told CNN: ""These political disputes were never really addressed before because everyone was filthy, stinking rich. When you're filthy, stinking poor, everything matters."" Elisabeth Afseth, of Investec, told CNN that Spain's upcoming bond payments  -- of 5.3 billion euros on October 29 and 15 billion euros on October 31 -- will leave the coffers ""very empty."" She added, ""Assuming the Treasury has sufficient cash reserves to cover the October redemptions the next pressure point comes in January."" Spain: Gliding toward bailout? While it is ""difficult"" to rule out a need for aid this year, Spain's situation is likely to drag on a little longer, she added. James Nixon, chief European economist at Societe Generale, believes the risk of a bailout is not ""imminent"" but that another spike in the country's borrowing costs would likely be the catalyst for any request. Spain is already poised to tap Europe's bailout funds to help its banks, which require almost 60 billion euros in support, according to last week's audit. Spain has 100 billion euros available to it after the Eurogroup in July agreed to assist the country to recapitalize its banks. However, Spain has always said the bank bailout is not a sovereign bailout, unlike those given to Greece, Ireland and Portugal. The banking audit showed seven of the 14 banks assessed -- accounting for approximately 38% of the Spanish banking system's credit portfolio -- failed the stress tests. Spain's next crisis: Regional splits? At a press conference in Madrid last week, deputy economy minister Fernando Jiménez Latorre said Spain may ask for 40 billion euros of European aid while the rest of the money could come from the banks themselves. However, Silva said: ""if you don't force mergers [between banks] 60 billion euros isn't going to be enough, its going to be closer to 100 billion euros."" And Daiwa credit analyst Michael Symonds, commenting on the stress tests last week, told CNN the country still faced the ""heavy lifting."" He added, ""Over the coming months, restructuring plans will need to be finished-off and approved, the architecture of the bad bank finalized, and the delicate task of haircutting subordinated creditors -- many of which are retail investors -- carried out.""","Spain faces regional dissent ahead of local elections, 20 billion euro in debt repayments due this month .

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Chile's Chaiten volcano has been placed under red alert due to an increase in seismic activity for three weeks, the Chilean government said. The volcano in southern Chile became active in May 2008 after being dormant for more than 9,000 years. Volcanic activity was on the decline in the past few months until picking back up January 21, the Chilean Interior Ministry said in a news release Monday. The red alert, which indicates activity is above normal levels and an eruption could be imminent, was enacted in large part to protect tourists in the area, said Carmen Fernandez, director of Chile's National Emergency Office. Underground seismic rumblings 1.2 to 5 miles (2 to 8 kilometers) deep in the area around the volcano and constant gas eruptions in the dome indicate ""a high grade of instability,"" the National Emergency Office said. CNN Chile's Katherine Miranda contributed to this report.","Red alert enacted to protect tourists near Chile's Chaiten volcano, official says .

"Syria's neighbors are preparing for the worst as the specter of potential Western airstrikes hang heavily over a nervous Middle East. As U.S. President Barack Obama makes his case to Congress and the international community for a military response to an alleged chemical attack by Syrian regime forces in a Damascus suburb, CNN explores how the countries bordering war-torn Syria feel about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the possibility of foreign intervention in the bloody conflict there. Lebanon . Security is tightening and there is a mood of growing worry and angst in the streets of Beirut, where many are convinced that strikes on Damascus, less than 70 miles from the Lebanese capital, will further destabilize the country that, aside from Syria, has suffered the most as a result of the war. Tiny Lebanon is inextricably linked to its larger neighbor, and sectarian divisions there mirror those in Syria. But while politicians who support al-Assad say the proposed airstrikes are reminiscent of the lead-up to the war in Iraq, those who oppose him are playing it safe for now. Talal Arslan, the Lebanese Democratic Party leader and a supporter of al-Assad, said accusations of chemical weapons use by regime forces in a Damascus suburb were ""a reminder of (America's) previous lies to invade Iraq. No one buys these lies any longer."" Lebanese MP Walid Jumblatt, a staunch ally of the Syrian rebels who previously accused the Assad regime of killing his father in the early years of Lebanon's civil war in the 1970s, said strikes would not deal a fatal blow to the Syrian regime: ""The action will not be decisive, particularly in the absence of international consensus on strike or on the post-strike era."" Ahmad Fatfat, an anti-Assad member of the Lebanese parliament, said the ramifications of airstrikes would probably depend on the reaction of Hezbollah, the Beirut-based Shiite militant group that has joined Syria's civil war on behalf of its patrons in Damascus and Iran. The government has mostly tried to stay out of the conflict, but that hasn't stopped the bloodshed -- and those fleeing the fighting -- from spilling over Lebanon's borders. One in six people in Lebanon is now a Syrian refugee, and tensions between Lebanese and Syrians are rising. Hezbollah was the target of deadly Beirut bombings in recent weeks that killed dozens and left many in Lebanon believing that the country is now a proxy battlefield as Iran and Saudi Arabia fight to control the outcome of Syria's civil war. But despite these deep divisions, many Lebanese are united in the belief that potential strikes are little more than a superficial show of power from an American president backed into a corner by his ""red line"" declaration about chemical weapons use in Syria. Israel . Thousands of scared residents in cities across Israel made their way to gas-mask distribution centers amid fears that potential airstrikes on Syria could result in retaliatory chemical attacks. In 2011, Israeli President Shimon Peres insisted at a news conference that al-Assad ""must go,"" but the comments have been an exception for the Israeli government. In May of 2013, an Israeli defense ministry official specifically denied that Israel had ""done anything against Assad and his regime."" Still, Israel has been accused three times this year of launching airstrikes inside Syria. In January, a U.S. official said Israeli fighter jets bombed a Syrian convoy suspected of moving weapons to Hezbollah. Israel's military has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah or other terrorist groups as well as any effort to smuggle Syrian weapons into Lebanon that could threaten Israel. Jordan . In Amman, an hour's drive from the Syrian border and well within range of Syrian missiles, there are fears that Jordan's involvement in the civil war could lead to attacks on its own soil. King Abdullah is one of the West's key allies in the region and was the first Arab leader to call for al-Assad to step down. The vast majority of the country's citizens are Sunni and sympathize with the plight of the Syrian rebels trying to topple the country's Alawite regime. OPINION: Why strikes in Syria are a bad idea . It is an open secret that Saudi Arabia is using Jordan to smuggle weapons into Syria for the rebels. Jordan says it is doing all it can to prevent that and does not want to inflame the situation in Syria. But despite the fact the world's military leaders gathered last week in Jordan to discuss Syria, the government insists it will not be a launchpad for a Western strike on its neighbor. Government spokesman Mohammad Momani said: ""Our position regarding the Syrian crisis is based on our concern for Jordan's higher national interests and our unfailing policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of our neighbors."" ""Jordan renews its calls for a political solution in Syria and urges the international community to intensify efforts to reach such a solution."" Iraq . In Iraq, where at least 30,000 Syrian refugees fled over a five-day period in late August, the government has said in recent days that the country is on high alert in anticipation of a strike in Syria. Iraq is opposed to Western military intervention in Syria and is deeply divided along sectarian lines. Iraq's Shiite-dominated government is wary that the Sunni Islamists who've been involved in fighting al-Assad's regime are targeting the government in Baghdad. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki called for unity in a statement: ""What is happening in Syria threatens Iraq and the region, and all Iraqis, especially politicians, should unite and reject sectarianism and place the national interest above all partisan interests in order to ward off the dangers and protect national unity and sovereignty."" Saudi Arabia . Saudi Arabia, the region's Sunni powerhouse, is walking a very fine line on Syria. While many observers believe the Saudis tacitly approve of the strikes, the government has not come out publicly in support of Western military intervention. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal has called for the U.N. Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities to the Syrian people and said the Assad regime had lost sight of its Arab identity. A majority of Saudis support the rebels and want al-Assad gone, but they're also horrified about the plight of ordinary Syrians and believe missile strikes could exacerbate their suffering. Khaled Al-Maeena, editor-in-chief of the Saudi Gazette, told CNN: ""People here are against any attack that will cause more bloodshed to the existing conflict in Syria. They know what happened in Iraq -- how many innocent people died in Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Pakistan due to strikes. I hope and believe people are not excited at the prospect of hits on Syria."" ""I would not want to see any strike on Syria that will only add to the agony of the Syrian people. Arabs have had enough of collateral damage."" Egypt . In Egypt, which remains embroiled in its own deadly crisis more than a month after the military deposed and detained president Mohamed Morsy, a number of political parties have stood against foreign intervention in Syria. The Tamarrod movement, which spearheaded the drive to remove Morsy from office, ripped the U.S. and called on the Egyptian government to act in the event of a Western strike on Syria. Tamarrod spokesman Mahmoud Badr said: ""The U.S. is an imperial state that has destroyed Iraq and aims to destroy Syria and intervene in Egyptian affairs."" Hassan Shahin, another spokesman, ""demanded the closure of the Suez Canal"" if there is any naval movement toward Syria, according to state-owned Egyptian news. Nabil Fahmy, Egypt's minister of foreign affairs, said the only way forward in Syria is a political solution. Yemen . In Yemen, a country living under the constant specter of American drone strikes targeting al Qaeda militants, it is nearly impossible to find anyone who supports Western bombs in Syria, despite mixed attitudes about the Assad regime. Ahmed Bahri of Yemen's Haq Party told CNN that foreign intervention in Syria will only increase Yemeni and Arab resentment of the U.S. He said: ""Arabs do not trust the U.S. anymore because it is attacking numerous Arab countries -- but some Arab leaders are working against their people's will."" While many Yemenis would like to see al-Assad deposed, others are worried about the Sunni extremist groups that could replace him if he went. Al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula vastly expanded its base in Yemen after the fall of President Ali Abdullah Saleh during the Arab Spring in 2011. And while Yemenis feel terrorized by the group, they also live in daily fear of U.S. drone strikes. Youth activist Nasser al-Absi said a U.S. strike in Syria would merely create another generation of terrorists in the region. ""The U.S. will regret any attack in Syria ... Arabs are peaceful, but they are being attacked by the West. These attacks will make thousands of people join al Qaeda to avenge the death of their loved ones.""","Lebanon: Security tight amid fears Western strikes in Syria will destabilize country .

"London (CNN)British prosecutors have started a second attempt to convict a man of terrorism after he was caught with bomb-making directions, in a highly unusual case being heard partly in secret. The man, Erol Incedal, was found guilty last year of having details of how to make a bomb, but a jury failed to reach a decision on the more serious charge of plotting a terror attack. A new jury was selected Tuesday, and prosecutor Richard Whittam began the state's second try. Incedal was arrested in October 2013 and found to have the address of a property belonging to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife, Whittam told the jury. He also had the instructions for how to make a bomb on an SD card concealed between his phone and its case, Whittam said. Incedal does not need to have planned a specific attack or had a target in mind to be guilty of plotting terror, the prosecutor told the jury. The case is extremely unusual in that the media and public will be barred from hearing some of the evidence. A select group of 10 journalists will be allowed to hear other parts of the trial, but must leave their notes in court. The rest of the trial is open to the public. Incedal denies the charges.

"A major fire devoured thousands stalls in a market in Guatemala's capital Tuesday, state media reported. Authorities haven't determined what caused the fire, which broke out around 2:30 a.m. in La Terminal market in Guatemala City. The fire destroyed approximately 6,000 stalls in the market, the state-run AGN news agency reported. For hours, a dark column of smoke billowed from the market. Volunteer firefighters said they struggled to battle the blaze due to a shortage of water in the area, adding that they had difficulty persuading vendors to leave their stalls. ""People often stay to sleep in their posts,"" Guatemala City Mayor Alvaro Arzu said. ""They have gas tanks there. They are accidental, but with enormous consequences."" More than 300 people were evacuated from the area, and paramedics treated at least 15 people at the scene for smoke inhalation. Two people were transported to a hospital with burns, officials said. The fire spread quickly, officials said, because many makeshift stalls in the market were built with wood and plastic. President Otto Perez Molina flew over the market Tuesday and vowed that government funds would be devoted to rebuilding, AGN said.","State media: A massive fire destroyed 6,000 stalls in La Terminal market .

"Washington (CNN)For a group with the chief purpose of helping to get Democratic women elected into higher office, Emily's List enters 2016 closer to the top prize -- the presidency -- than ever before, and with fewer restrictions than what faced political organization the last time Hillary Clinton ran. Senior operatives at the Democratic operation are pledging that 2016 will be Emily's List's most active election to date, one where they hope the group's deep connections to Clinton -- the expected favorite for the Democratic nomination -- will magnify their efforts. Emily's List was very active in the race in 2008 during Clinton's first bid, but election laws have changed vastly since then -- mostly thanks to the Supreme Court's Citizen's United decision in 2010 -- making it possible for the group to play a bigger role. The former secretary of state herself will headline the group's 30th anniversary gala in Washington, D.C next week, a nod to their importance to both the former first lady and to Democratic 2016 scene. Denise Feriozzi, the political director at Emily's List has been tapped to lead the group's independent expenditure effort in 2016, expected to outpace their most expensive cycle to date -- $14 million last year. The group, which raised more than $60 million for Democratic women in 2014, expects that with Clinton atop the ticket -- and energy among other women candidates to run -- they will easily break through those fundraising numbers. ""We are going to play a bigger role than we have ever played,"" Feriozzi said about the group. ""There is going to be a level of excitement for our Emily's List community and from women and men around the country to elect the first women president and, more importantly, to elect the right person."" Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily's List, has left the Priorities USA board so that she can work closer with the Clinton campaign and still comply with election coordination rules. Feriozzi will take Schriock's seat on the super PAC board, a body that has long been seen as the center of the pro-Clinton world, where leaders from the different organizations can meet and coordinate efforts to help boost Clinton's campaign efforts. The group's will not be just about boosting Clinton and female Democrats. As it has been in the past, Emily's List's 2016 plan will also focus on trying to define Republican candidates as bad for women across the country. Some of these efforts have already started. Earlier this month, Emily's List launched ""GOP 2016: Insult & Injury,"" an interactive graphic that will ""chronicle Republicans' out of touch agenda for American women."" This kind of messaging is common for Emily's List, but with Clinton atop the ticket, advisers for the group expect the contrasts to be more defined. The focus is on ensuring that the gender gap for a likely Clinton campaign is as big -- if not bigger -- than the 12-point margin that Obama enjoyed in 2012. ""That is our niche, that is our role, and that is what we are going to do here,"" Feriozzi said, stressing that the group will be targeted and strategic about their investments. That will be critical, because spending in the 2016 election is expected to break all previous records. Sources have told CNN that Priorities, the keystone Democratic Super PAC going into the next election cycle, hopes to raise $300-$500 million for 2016, while the Koch brothers, uber-Republican donors and businessman, have said they will spend $898 million during the election. Emily's List's pockets are considerably smaller, but Feriozzi and others said their money will be more focused than scattershot. ""I am not going to say what we are going to do and what we are not, but we, as a progressive community, have got to be more targeted and smarter,"" Feriozzi said. ""We are going to figure out what that is.""","Emily's List, energized with the prospect of electing the first woman president, is preparing to go big in 2016 .

"(CNN)Imagine that you lived in a country that every day had to stay vigilante because of the risk of terrorist attacks -- physical or of the cyber variety. Or that has faced blizzards of historic proportions, with another winter storm on the way. And imagine if the people you were depending on to help you were expected to turn up for work, but that they may or may not be getting paid. Well, thanks to a completely avoidable standoff in Congress, you might not have to imagine at all. February 28 marks the date when money for the Department of Homeland Security runs out as House Republicans hold the DHS's funding hostage to make an ideological point. They say they are unhappy with President Barack Obama's executive orders rescinding deportation for a class of undocumented immigrants known as the Dreamers, among others. As a result, unless a deal is reached, more than 200,000 employees will be required to show up to work next Monday without pay. If we lived in a world that existed solely on the ideological plane, then House Speaker John Boehner's approach might be brilliant -- the work of the agency created to enforce our borders and immigration rules would grind to a halt, the President would capitulate, and Boehner would have achieved some sort of short-lived ""victory"" on the backs of immigrants, many of whom arrived here as babies. But most of us live in the real world, where actions have consequences for the rest of us. And that means not just those disappointed immigrants who believed they were beginning the process of securing citizenship. It also includes those who work at DHS and the people that depend on them. Maybe the public isn't outraged by this fight because they associate DHS with long lines at airports and the checks undertaken by the Transportation Security Administration. But hundreds of thousands of ""essential"" workers at TSA and the many other sections of DHS that work to keep us safe are facing the reality that they will not get a regular paycheck. Yes, they will get their money eventually, but if this standoff continues, there will be no certainty when -- it could be weeks. And how many Americans supporting families can work indefinitely not knowing when the next paycheck is coming? This isn't to say that the creation and execution of DHS's work has been seamless. Created back in 2003 through the merging of a few dozen agencies (and the addition of a couple more), DHS has struggled with its identity, morale (it regularly ranks as least favorite federal agency to work at), and role.  And the department is by no means perfect -- I served as assistant secretary early in the Obama administration, so I am fully aware of the challenges. But one of DHS's fundamental roles has always been to work with states and localities in crises management, disaster relief funding, and emergency response training.  And it is in these specific roles -- supporting state emergency management agencies, writing checks to localities and individuals who have suffered harm, and training hundreds of thousands of first-responders on how to protect their communities -- that the DHS standoff will surely be felt.  The homeland matters. Without funding, local budgeting processes and support for first responders cannot be accounted for.  Without funding, homeowners and those harmed in disasters will not receive monetary relief.  Without funding, the training and exercises that are funded by the federal government to support local and state planning in a real crisis will not materialize. Right now, where I live, in the Boston area, we have suffered four blizzards of historical proportions that have brought the city to a standstill. Literally.  Our metropolitan transit system has been closed periodically, roads cannot be plowed fast enough, our harbor's commercial activity is slowed due to ice buildup, and there is simply no place to put all this snow.  Local businesses have been harmed, damage has accrued, and the citizenry is demoralized. But the situation will be worse for residents in hard-hit places like Boston if DHS and one of its agencies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is not able to help buttress local and state efforts at recovering from the barrage of storms the region has faced. Of course our disaster-relief system is not perfect. But the system we have now is the one that individuals, cities and states have come to rely on.  And it does provide funds for localities to train and exercise their responses so that fewer people will be at risk. These are the stakes in the real world. Yet even though a Texas court may have handed Boehner a face-saving lifeline by ruling Obama's actions unlawful and essentially stopping the presidential actions pending appeal, House Republicans appear undeterred, although Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday indicated Senate Republicans might be willing to offer some concessions. As a result of this deadlock, you can increasingly expect to hear governors and mayors -- who actually run something -- to begin to push House Republicans to sign a clean funding bill that will keep DHS funded. After all, these leaders know as well as anyone that ideology can only go so far when the well-being and safety of our homeland is at stake.","Department of Homeland Security will run out of money without funding deal .

"The originators of the Occupy Central movement suggest protesters should retreat, as a new poll shows support for the movement flagging. In a random survey of 513 people conducted by the University of Hong Kong, 83% said pro-democracy protesters should cease their eight-week occupation of major roads in Hong Kong, while just 13% said the occupiers should continue. ""Given the backlash from the community, we have advised students to think of other forms of protest, instead of just focusing on occupations,"" Occupy Central co-founder Chan Kin-man told CNN. ""The occupation is controversial; it creates disturbance -- this is something we have to admit. We have to move to a new stage."" Two-month blockade . The protest has now blocked major roads around Hong Kong nearly two months in an attempt to pressure officials into giving Hong Kong open elections for its next leader. But neither the Beijing or Hong Kong governments have shown any willingness to compromise, and some protesters have grown agitated. Yesterday, the movement took an unusually aggressive turn when masked protesters rammed barricades and hurled concrete slabs to smash through a glass door to Hong Kong's Legislative Council building -- where the city's government meets. Protesters also charged police lines, leading police to respond with pepper spray and batons. Six were arrested, and the Hong Kong government released a statement denouncing the protesters as ""violent radicals."" Pro-democracy legislator Fernando Cheung, who tried unsuccessfully to stop the smashing, told CNN it was a ""major setback"" for the movement that has won widespread praise for its politeness and civility. ""I understand they wanted to scale up the action, but they didn't understand that that would only destroy the campaign."" Student leader Alex Chow urged students to continue protesting nonviolently. ""If we do not choose to give up, then there is still hope and we can choose to utilize different tactics, to explore ways to counter the government,"" he said. Uncertain future . Hong Kong's High Court has issued a series of injunctions authorizing police to begin clearing protest sites. A small section of the main protest site was cleared Tuesday, and larger clearances are planned in the coming days. In the face of the impending action, protesters disagree over what should be done next. Chan and other protest leaders have proposed a ""community education"" campaign, in which democracy supporters would enter Hong Kong neighborhoods to sway locals to their cause. Another potential strategy is for the city's pro-democracy legislators to resign en masse. This would trigger a by-election, giving Hong Kongers a chance to demonstrate their support for the democracy movement by voting the legislators back in. Other hardline demonstrators advocate an escalation of the physical occupations -- though protest leaders discourage this. Despite the uncertainty, the movement has already exceeded all expectations, said Chan. ""Our original plan was people would just sit down, holding hands, and peacefully let police arrest us,"" he said. ""We expected our Occupy Central movement would only last for a few days, not weeks or months.""

"(CNN)A victim of a reported home invasion in Bristol, Connecticut, was found outside of the credit union where he works with what appeared to be an explosive device strapped to his body, authorities said Monday. The victim, identified as Matthew Yussman, chief financial officer of Achieve Financial Credit Union, told police that multiple attackers broke into his home Monday morning and attached a device -- subsequently believed to be fake, according to a law enforcement source -- to his body. A similar device was also strapped to Yussman's mother, who was also in the home at the time of the break-in, the law enforcement source said. The suspects then ordered Yussman to go to the credit union in nearby New Britain and clean out its vault, according to the source. On his way, he called the credit union's CEO and reported what was happening, according to police. Authorities responded, evacuating area residents, closing schools and shutting streets near the credit union, which was closed at the time of the incident. Officers found Yussman in a car, police said. He was cooperative, and shortly before noon members of the Connecticut bomb squad declared the device safe and turned it over to the FBI. ""There is no question that this was a scary situation,"" said New Britain Mayor Erin E. Stewart. No injuries were reported in the incident. New Britain Police Chief James Wardwell said the FBI will analyze the device further, but declined to say whether the bomb was fake, citing the ongoing investigation. Bristol Police on Tuesday said they are seeking two men of medium build who were wearing dark clothing, ski masks and goggles during the home invasion. At least one of the men is white, and they spoke in ""distinct accents that were not consistent with being native to Connecticut."" The suspects possibly were riding in a white, older-model four-door Mazda and might have been ""in the Tunxis Mead and the area of Route 10 in Farmington during the morning of February 23,"" police said in a statement. New Britain police asked anyone with information to call the department's tip line at 860-826-3199.

"Ever feel like no one really understands you? Well ""Pepper"" could be about to change all that. That's because Pepper is actually a robot and touted as the world's first with the ability to read emotions. The humanoid robot  -- which looks slightly like a shrunken Michelin Man -- was unveiled to curious onlookers in Tokyo stores on Friday by SoftBank, a Japanese telecom giant and Aldebaran, a French robotics company. Pepper doesn't look much like its name. Standing under four-feet tall with a tablet computer mounted to its chest, it has human-like hands and a mermaid-like lower torso — though its toddler-like voice seems incongruous with this state-of-the-art facade. Despite the high-pitched voice, Pepper is able to converse about everything from the weather, to more sophisticated topics like the latest fluctuations in the stock markets. Yet the great differentiator is the fact Pepper is fully interactive, making eye contact when meeting people. Pepper is ""the first robot to read human emotions,"" said Softbank's CEO Masayoshi Son told reporters at a press conference in the Japanese capital on Thursday. ""Robots like Pepper are adding a new dimension in our daily lives. They would change it with the same magnitude as the PC, Internet and mobile phones did."" How Pepper reads your moods . Using its emotion recognition functions, Pepper can react to people in its vicinity -- making jokes, dancing and even rapping (in Japanese), as it did in an onstage demonstration on Thursday. Pepper can analyze facial expressions, human voice tones and gestures, then react autonomously through algorithms, its creators say. ""Our vision is to create an affectionate robot that can understand people's feelings. Then autonomously, it will take action,"" said Son. He envisions robots playing roles in education, healthcare and entertainment, but their primary goal isn't to work in the industry like existing robots. ""Our's is not aiming for productivity, but rather at the home or store, where we provide fun and entertainment,"" Son said. Pepper is designed to be a family robot -- perhaps more like a sleeker version of Rosie, the household robot on the cartoon ""The Jetsons."" ""Pepper is powered by love inside a family,"" Son said. ""Not only is he making jokes, making them laugh. The robot acts out at its own expense, in natural disaster, it can help them and also comfort those people who are sad or lonely, encourage them or make them laugh."" When Pepper goes on sale . Pepper goes on sale in Japan for around US$2,000 in February 2015. For now, several Peppers are at Softbank stores in Tokyo for spectators to visit. The creators say before releasing Pepper for sale, they want the robots to accumulate more knowledge, to evolve and get more sophisticated in its interactions with humans. ""Several thousand Peppers are going to learn at the store,"" Son said. ""Everything they learned and gained, is going to be accumulated into the cloud-based service. So that can be accelerating the evolution of the collective wisdom."" Pepper functions through cloud-based artificial intelligence. SoftBank and Aldebaran envision the robot being sold overseas eventually. After all, Pepper is quite the polyglot, speaking 17 languages.","Japan's Softbank releases new robot Pepper in its stores .

"Washington (CNN)No civil rights charges will be brought against George Zimmerman in the February 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, the U.S. Justice Department announced Tuesday, citing what it said was insufficient evidence. Zimmerman was acquitted of criminal charges in 2013 in the killing of the 17-year-old Martin, who was black. ""Though a comprehensive investigation found that the high standard for a federal hate crime prosecution cannot be met under the circumstances here, this young man's premature death necessitates that we continue the dialogue and be unafraid of confronting the issues and tensions his passing brought to the surface,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said in a news release. ""We, as a nation, must take concrete steps to ensure that such incidents do not occur in the future."" Justice Department prosecutors and officials from the FBI met with Martin's family on Tuesday to inform them of the decision, the department said. In a Tuesday afternoon statement, the family thanked the Justice Department for its investigation and ""millions of people around the world"" who supported them. ""Although we are disappointed in these findings, it has steeled our resolve to continue traveling the country with the message of the Trayvon Martin Foundation, which is dedicated to protecting our youth and empowering those who demand justice and peace,"" the statement said. ""We remain poised to do everything in our power to help eradicate senseless violence in our communities, because we don't want any other parent to experience the unexplainable loss we have endured.  We will never, ever forget what happened to our son, Trayvon, and will honor his memory by working tirelessly to make the world a better place."" The case stirred a groundswell of emotion, much of it centered around race. Civil rights leaders, as well as Martin's relatives, took to the streets contending that the teen -- who'd gone out to get a drink and Skittles from a Sanford, Florida, convenience store only to run into Zimmerman on his way back -- might still be alive today if not for the color of his skin. Zimmerman, then a neighborhood watch volunteer, never denied shooting Martin. But he argued that he did so in self-defense. He wasn't charged right away -- his second-degree murder charge didn't come down until April 2012. That was a month after the Justice Department and FBI announced that they had opened an investigation. Still, the bar was always high to charge Zimmerman under federal hate crime laws, as it is for anyone. The FBI defines a hate crime as ""a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with an added element of bias."" Proving that a person attacked someone is one thing. Proving what was going through their mind when they did it -- especially if the other person is dead -- is much harder. Holder acknowledged the law's high standard in April 2012: ""Something that was reckless, that was negligent does not meet that standard,"" Holder said. ""We have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind."" CNN's Evan Perez and Shimon Prokupecz reported from Washington, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","""We will never, ever forget what happened to our son,"" Trayvon Martin's family says .

"(CNN)Not many streets have been home to a Nobel Laureate -- and even fewer have been home to two. Yet, Vilakazi Street in the heart of bustling Soweto has been exactly that, housing both South African leaders Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela. And this claim to fame is paying dividends for current residents -- helping transform the area into a thriving business community. Here, visitors from all over the world walk past traditional dancers, hawkers and waiting taxis to visit the building that was Mandela's home when he walked free from prison on Robben Island in 1990. With its restaurants, boutiques and bars, this buzzing boulevard is no ordinary residential road. Surviving legacy . For local entrepreneur Sakhumzi Maqubela, it was words spoken by the iconic freedom fighter that inspired him to open a restaurant in the area -- and provide employment for people in his community. ""Mandela used to fight with people that ever since there is black government people are complaining unemployment is high, the crime is high,"" Maqubela remembers. ""Mandela was saying, 'what are you doing in your own capacity to create jobs?'"" Maqubela left his job at a major bank to start the business in 2001. Back then, he had four employees, but now he employs 75 people to serve traditional local dishes and burgers to approximately 400 customers a day. ""Tourism business has grown a lot here,"" he says, ""especially after the 2010 World Cup -- we get tourists almost every day."" Indeed, the number of visitors to Johannesburg as a whole has increased by 300,000 since 2010, according to the Mastercard Global Destination Cities Index. And the growth in visitors has led to more money being spent. The 4.3 million people who visited the city in 2014 spent $3.2 billion, up from the $3.1 billion tourists spent in 2012. Such economic realities are changing perceptions of Soweto, which has a poor and violent past. During the struggle against the brutal policies of apartheid, students and residents took to the township's streets in June 1976 to protest against the use of Afrikaans as the main teaching language in schools. Some estimates say over 560 people were killed during the countrywide unrest which followed. The episode shocked the world, and caused international governments to impose sanctions against South Africa. Among the dead was 12-year-old Hector Pieterson, who was shot by police in Soweto. A museum dedicated to the memory of the uprising, named after Pieterson, now stands close to the spot where the child was fatally injured. More recently, violence caused by other social issues has threatened to spoil Soweto's appeal. In January, a teenager accused of stealing died after being shot by a Somali shop owner. In the looting spree which followed, businesses owned by foreigners were targeted and police arrested at least 83 people and confiscated weapons. Emerging middle class . Despite these issues, businesses like Maqubela's restaurant are seeing success on the back of a rising middle class. House prices have surged by as much as 300% since 2009, with certain areas becoming sought after. ""I was actually a little surprised by how nice (Soweto) is,"" says American tourist Annette Watley. ""I've done a township tour in Cape Town before, in Langa, so for me I was surprised by the number of restaurants and the industry that is going on. It feels like it is a separate city than Johannesburg."" In April, local entrepreneurs will host the area's first technology conference, the Soweto Innovation Week, which is expected to attract over 400 attendees. ""There are many tech and digital innovators in the townships who just need that extra bit of inspiration,"" says Tefo Mohapi who has helped organize the event. ""We believe Soweto specifically has been ready [to host such an event] for years now."" Businessman Thabo Modise is part of this emerging middle class and agrees with Mohapi. After opening his Shova Lifestyle Boutique on Vilakazi Street a year ago he says the future is bright. ""The location is a prime spot. Vilakazi as you know we are in local and international markets. It's an exposure to us even when we are looking forward to expand,"" he says. ""Shova means pushing, so we are pushing towards greatness, with a simple vision of transforming township into an upmarket economic powerhouse."" 'Pockets and niches' But, while some are doing well, not all of Soweto's residents are so positive. ""The tourist stretch around the Mandela house is thriving, but it is one of the few areas that is doing well. There are pockets and niches,"" says local activist Trevor Ngwane who works with the grassroots group Soweto Electricity Crisis Committee. ""Overall in the township we are looking at a 30-40% rate of unemployment. It's quite uneven and even contradictory."" Boutiques, restaurants and museums which tell the story of Soweto's apartheid struggle form the economic back bone of Vilakazi Street, but informal traders are also keeping busy. Brightly colored trinkets and souvenirs draw in tourists and help to grow a smaller economy. Their sales may be pennies for some, but it means international dreams for street performers like Eric Matshidiso and Thulo Medi. ""What we are willing is to see ourselves in overseas, promoting our music and dance,"" says Matshidiso. ""Maybe if we can go overseas we will get something that will put us up. So that people must recognize us.""

"(CNN)The Somali jihadi group Al-Shabaab grabbed headlines at the weekend when it released a video urging Muslims living in the United States, Britain and Canada to launch terrorist attacks against high-profile shopping malls -- including the Mall of America in Minnesota. So, why the threat now? And how worried should we be? The answer to the first question is easy.  Al-Shabaab is trying to get attention. And it succeeded. Al-Shabaab desperately needed such attention for two reasons. For a start, it has been entirely overshadowed by the violent extremist group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria over the past year.  The fact is that ISIS is garnering virtually all of the media coverage of extremists, and as a result is attracting virtually all the recruits and money from the patrons of violent extremism. This has left jihadi groups like al Qaeda, Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab struggling to reclaim some of the spotlight from their new ""rival,"" and a call to attack Western shopping malls was a chance to earn some easy headlines while also trying to burnish international credentials that were badly tarnished in 2012 when it suffered a bloody internal purge that killed off some of its most prominent foreign leaders and disheartened former supporters. But Al-Shabaab also had a potential marketing problem on its hands with the release of a new propaganda video, ""The Westgate Siege: Retributive Justice."" That 75-minute long video was an uninspired tirade against the Kenyan government that said nothing the group had not claimed many times before.  It was far too long and doomed to be ignored. By tacking on a call in the final minute of the film for Muslims in the West to attack shopping malls -- and then naming specific targets -- the producers guaranteed that their otherwise forgettable video would get global headlines.  It was a clever marketing move. Does Al-Shabaab have a legitimate grievance against the three countries it singled out? Of course, these governments all support the Somali Federal Government and the African Union peacekeeping forces in Somalia, both of which are fighting against Al-Shabaab. The United States, moreover, has launched a number of drone and missile attacks against Al-Shabaab, killing their leader Ahmed Godane in 2014. Some would view this as justification for Al-Shabaab to ""take the war to the West."" But the reality is that many dozens of countries, from Norway to the United Arab Emirates to China, give robust support to the Somali Federal Government and assist it in the fight against Al-Shabaab. The reason Al-Shabaab singled out these three countries is therefore more venal -- those are the three nations with the highest concentrations of Somali diaspora members. So, how worried should we be if this was mostly a marketing ploy? Exactly as worried as we were before the video was released. The threat of ""lone wolf"" terrorism -- a single individual who is inspired to commit an act of terrorism in the name of a radical cause -- has long been a major homeland security concern. For years, violent extremist groups such as ISIS, al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula and Al-Shabaab have been calling on Muslims living in the West to wage jihad against the unbelievers on their home soil. For example, the former leader of AQAP, a U.S.-born cleric named Anwar al-Awlaki, gained notoriety for a cover article in his English- language ""Inspire"" magazine entitled ""How to Make a Bomb in Your Mom's Kitchen."" Likewise, in a 2013 video, Al-Shabaab called on Muslims in the West ""to grab whatever you've got"" to attack non-Muslims. Despite such calls to action, though, the good news is that very few Muslim citizens in the West have paid any attention to these calls to war.  Al-Shabaab's 2013 video failed to inspire any known acts of violence, and its current video will probably meet the same fate.  Moreover, the plea to individual ""holy warriors"" to launch attacks is an implicit admission that Al-Shabaab lacks the network of operatives to conduct a planned terrorist attack itself. The bad news is that lone wolf attacks are difficult or even impossible for law enforcement to track and prevent. In every country in the world, a small percentage of deeply troubled, angry, and impressionable individuals are susceptible to calls to political violence. Denmark just suffered from a fatal act of terrorism by a lone-wolf attacker with no radical Islamist links but who was seized with uncontrolled anger at Danish society.  The 2013 Boston Marathon bombings were allegedly planned and executed by two self-radicalized Chechen brothers. We can and should reduce the threat of homegrown terrorism, but we will never be able to stop it entirely. Vigilance, which Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson called for after the Al-Shabaab threat, is entirely appropriate. But vigilance must not be an excuse for overreaction.  After all, an overreaction is exactly what the jihadists are hoping to provoke.","Al-Shabaab has released a video calling for attacks on Western shopping malls .

"For Hafez al-Assad, the calculation was clear. He had won power in Syria by outmaneuvering rivals and, when necessary, using force. His son would not have to repeat those steps to win power -- but likely would have to emulate his father to remain as president. Al-Assad groomed his son, gave him a military pedigree, toughened him. The path was set. The son in question was not Bashar al-Assad, the man now leading Syria in a spiraling civil war and toward a possible military strike by the United States. The son Hafez wanted to be president was his first-born, Bassel. Analysts say Hafez al-Assad was closest to Bassel. Bashar, as a child, was shy and modest. The father had a distant relationship with him. First on CNN: Videos of chemical attack effects . That changed in 1994, when Bassel al-Assad, always known to be reckless as well as cruel, was killed while driving at a high speed toward the Damascus airport to see his girlfriend. Syria would not have the strongman Hafez envisioned. It would fall to Bashar, the reluctant heir who really wanted to be an ophthamologist. When Hafez al-Assad died of a heart attack in June 2000, Bashar inherited a regime built on fierce loyalty -- to family and religious sect. Hafez had been born into a poor family from the Alawite mountains in northwestern Syria. The Alawites had often been looked down upon by the wealthier, majority Sunnis in Syria, and Hafez al-Assad was determined to break the mold. He shattered it. He joined the Ba'ath Party and then rose through the ranks of the Syrian air force. But it was hardly that straightforward. The man thrived in the backrooms of Syrian palace intrigue where, according to most accounts, betraying friends and killing or banishing enemies put you on the fast track to success. Elder al-Assad was careful with U.S. In Syria, analysts say, there were more than 20 successful and unsuccessful coups between 1949 and 1970, when Hafez al-Assad took power. He was involved in three of them himself. Once in power, Hafez al-Assad proved to be one of the most cunning, ruthless dictators in a region full of them.  He crushed a 1982 rebellion by the Muslim Brotherhood in the city of Hama by laying siege to the city and killing more than 10,000 of his own people.  At different times he waged war against, and negotiated peace with Israel. EU urges strong response; Kerry seeks support for military action . He made fast friends with Hezbollah, which the United States considers a terrorist group. But he also made sure the United States was never a full-fledged enemy.  In the 1970s and '80s he did that by sending his forces to the aid of embattled Christians in Lebanon. And in 1990 and 1991, when President George H.W. Bush was building a coalition against Saddam Hussein, Hafez al-Assad committed 2,000 troops to the coalition side. Bashar followed that lead. The administrations of both George W. Bush and Barack Obama have, at different periods, engaged in diplomacy with Bashar's regime and pushed away from it.  The Bush team reached out in 2003 when it needed an ally against Iraq. In the early years of the Obama administration, Sen. John Kerry -- the man now calling Bashar al-Assad a ""thug and a murderer"" -- was the point man in the administration's efforts to cultivate the Syrian dictator. There is a telling image from that period: a photograph taken in early 2009 of  Kerry and his wife, Teresa, having an intimate dinner in Damascus with Bashar al-Assad and his glamorous, London-born wife, Asma. Several scenarios possible . How did it all unravel? Analysts say the civil war is partially the result of old resentments. Much of the majority Sunni population is embittered after decades under the rule of a despotic family from a small minority, the Alawites. But Bashar al-Assad also had trouble changing the old ways of his father. ""Hafez al-Assad stabilized Syria through a closed system. People couldn't travel. They couldn't communicate very well. International news was very limited"", says Andrew Tabler of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Chemical weapons: The desperate army's escape from stalemate . Tabler, who wrote an inside account of the al-Assad regime entitled ""In the Lion's Den,"" says, ""When Bashar came to power, he lifted the restrictions on travel, allowed people to read international newspapers, satellite television and the Internet. And it opened Syrians' minds. But how  do you control this system? And how do you basically perpetuate authoritarian and tyrannical rule?"" Obama has called on Congress to back plans to punish al-Assad militarily for an alleged chemical weapons attack in his own country. Meanwhile, his regime is locked in a bloody fight  with rebels. More than 100,000 Syrians have died, according to the United Nations. How does it end for the House of Assad? There are several possibilities.

"(CNN)Marijuana smokers now have a new place to put on their bucket lists: Alaska, which on Tuesday became the third state to officially OK marijuana use. Following Colorado's lead, voters passed the Alaska Marijuana Legalization ballot measure in November. Legalization became official on Tuesday, which means that now ""the use of marijuana (is) legal for persons 21 years of age or older."" There are limits to this law, as there are in similar ones in other states. People still can't legally have more than 1 ounce of marijuana on them. Nor can they harvest more than 4 ounces in their home. And consuming marijuana in public and driving while high are no-nos. Then there's the fact that the law isn't fully implemented yet. The regulatory structure allowing for entrepreneurs to set up shops like those found in Colorado is still in the works, so right now no one can legally make a living selling the drug. Not to mention that, under federal law, marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 narcotic. That makes its use a federal crime. Is weed legal in your state? Still, as in many states, there seems to be movement in Washington on that front. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder told CNN in October he is ""cautiously optimistic"" on the subject of marijuana legalization. Holder said the Justice Department is focused on marijuana distribution to minors, interstate trafficking and drug violence, not incarcerating ""low level people who are simply there for possessory offenses."" In the absence -- some might say in defiance -- of any sweeping federal change on marijuana, some states have taken the initiative. Twenty-three states still prohibit cannabis outright. But the rest of them have either legalized medical marijuana or decriminalized marijuana possession. Colorado became the first to go one step further in legalizing pot, followed by Washington state. And now there's one more in Alaska.","Alaska joins Colorado, Washington state in legalizing marijuana use .
Having 1 ounce or less of pot is now OK, but you can't do it in public or if you're under 21 .
Marijuana is still an illegal narcotic under federal law ."
"(CNN)A Saudi Arabian rights activist sentenced to prison and 1,000 lashes for insulting Islam will not be flogged Friday because of medical reasons, his wife said. Raif Badawi, convicted on charges that included insulting Islam, had been scheduled to receive the second of 20 sentenced floggings after Friday prayers in Jeddah. He received the first flogging on January 9. A doctor who examined him before the scheduled flogging determined that his wounds had not yet healed and that the flogging should be delayed, human rights group Amnesty International said. ""The doctor concluded that the wounds had not yet healed properly and that he would not be able to withstand another round of lashes at this time,"" Amnesty International said in a statement. Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haida, said from her home in Canada that she expects the floggings to resume next Friday. One of his friends, Ali Rizvi, said from Toronto that the delay is ""definitely encouraging."" ""None of us are completely satisfied,"" he told CNN's ""New Day."" ""This is the Saudi regime,"" he said. ""We don't know what's going to happen from here onwards, but it's definitely a step in the right direction."" Rights groups and others, including the U.S. State Department, have called for Saudi Arabia to call off the floggings, the first of which appeared to be captured on unverified cell phone video uploaded to YouTube. ""Not only does this postponement on health grounds expose the utter brutality of this punishment, it underlines its outrageous inhumanity,"" said Said Boumedouha, Amnesty International's deputy Middle East and North Africa program director. Badawi was convicted in 2014 and sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes after creating an online forum in 2008 that his wife says was meant to encourage discussion about faith.","Saudi activist's flogging delayed on medical grounds, his wife says .

"(CNN)The  talented, charismatic and handsome Neil Patrick Harris brilliantly ushered this year's Oscars through the potential landmines of political commentary and irreverent humor. Indeed, from hosting many of the entertainment world's most prestigious award shows, to posing on the recent cover of Architectural Digest with his husband David Burtka, it's nearly impossible not to see Harris front and center somewhere. All of which makes it hard to remember this former child star was a closeted actor afraid of being found out, not too long ago. In so many ways, Harris' career—as well as the resurrected career of last year's Oscar host, Ellen DeGeneres-- are reminders of how we're learning to treat each other better. Of how we're learning to allow space for those who are different from us. With a Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage looming, Harris not only served as an Oscar host, but an unspoken reminder of the work that still must be done in the name of equality. Oscar night was full of such reminders. Such as in John Legend's sobering acceptance speech, which touched on the recent, systematic attack on American voter's rights and the disproportionate incarceration rate for black men. ""Nina Simone said it's an artist's duty to reflect the times we're in,"" he said as he clutched the Oscar he shared with Common for best original song, ""Glory"", from the film ""Selma"". "" 'Selma' is now because the struggle for justice is right now...There are more black men under correctional control today than there were in slavery in 1850."" And during her best supporting actress (""Boyhood"") acceptance speech, Patricia Arquette brought Meryl Streep and others to their feet as she took time to criticize the gender pay gap. ""To every woman who gave birth, to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation, we have fought for everybody else's equal rights... it is our time to have wage equality once and for all and equal rights for women in the United States of America!""  she said. And then there was best-adapted screenplay winner Graham Moore (""The Imitation Game""), and his words of encouragement for those who feel they are on the outside looking in. ""I would like for this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she's weird or she's different or she doesn't fit in anywhere—yes you do,"" he said. ""I promise you do, you do. Stay weird. Stay different. And when it's your turn and you are standing on the stage please pass the same message to the next person who comes along."" Politically inflected acceptance speeches are hardly new at the Oscars. But these felt different: They were not some self-important actor's hijacking the program for a personal agenda, but rather an acknowledgement of the very real conversations we are all having right now. Even a handful of immigration references found their way on stage as ""Birdman"" director/screenwriter Alejandro González Iñárritu acknowledged he followed up fellow Latino director Alfonso Cuarón as best director. Later, while accepting the Oscar for Best Picture, Iñárritu was more direct: ""The ones that live in this country, who are part of the latest generation of immigrants, I just pray that they can be treated with the same dignity and respect of the ones who came before and built this incredible immigrant nation. Fans of ""Selma"" may still be upset about the awards snubs that preceded Oscar night for the film, which traced Martin Luther King's campaign for equal voting rights for black people (the movie's sole statue was for the song), but the ceremony in many ways took up the themes beautifully portrayed in the film—both spoken and unspoken.","LZ: Neil Patrick Harris hosting the Oscars was an apt backdrop for theme of fighting inequality that ran through the night .
He says in acceptance speeches actors' advocacy for equality -- for blacks, women, LGBT people -- was timely, moving ."
"Arnold Abbott handed out four plates of food to homeless people in a South Florida park. Then police stopped the 90-year-old from serving up another bite. ""An officer said, 'Drop that plate right now -- like I had a weapon,'"" Abbott said. Abbott and two pastors in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, were charged for feeding the homeless in public on Sunday, the city's first crackdowns under a new ordinance banning public food sharing, CNN affiliate WPLG reported. Now they face possible jail time and a $500 fine, WPLG said. Despite some criticism from homeless advocates, city officials have vowed the new rules will be enforced. ""Just because of media attention we don't stop enforcing the law. We enforce the laws here in Fort Lauderdale,"" Mayor Jack Seiler told WPLG. He defended the law in an interview with the Sun-Sentinel newspaper. ""I'm not satisfied with having a cycle of homeless in the city of Fort Lauderdale,"" Seiler said. ""Providing them with a meal and keeping them in that cycle on the street is not productive."" But Abbott, who has been helping feed homeless people in the area through his Love Thy Neighbor nonprofit since 1991, said authorities are targeting the city's most vulnerable residents. ""These are the poorest of the poor. They have nothing. They don't have a roof over their head,"" he said. ""Who can turn them away?"" Recently, the city has also passed an ordinance limiting the storage of personal property in public, WPLG said. Then came the restrictions for food sharing. ""The city passed an ordinance requiring us to have a Porta-Potty. It's ridiculous. The whole thing was designed to rid Fort Lauderdale of its homeless,"" Abbott said. ""Police told me anyone who touches a pan ... anyone who is involved, will be arrested."" It's a battle Abbott has fought before. In 1999 he sued the city for banning him from feeding homeless people on the beach -- and won, according to WPLG. He said the threat of charges won't stop him from doing it again. ""I'm not afraid of jail. I'm not looking to go, but if I have to, I will,"" he said. On Wednesday, Abbott said he'll be at Fort Lauderdale Beach, ready to serve another meal.","Arnold Abbott faces charges for feeding homeless people under a new ordinance .

"(CNN)A U.S. court has ruled that the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian Liberation Organization must pay more than $650 million to American citizens and their loved ones  for attacks in Israel in the early 2000s. This week's decision, issued from the U.S. District Court in southern New York, could mean millions of dollars each to 40 people or their estates. Such a ruling may also open the door to similar lawsuits against foreign governments for their part in terrorism, like one against Saudi Arabia's government tied to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. That said, the decision isn't final. And even if it does hold up, there's no guarantee the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian Liberation Organization will pay up. Both groups are ""deeply disappointed"" by Monday's ruling, which Palestinian Authority spokesman Mahmoud Khalifa said stemmed from ""baseless"" charges and ""ignored the legal precedent set time and again by other U.S. courts ... that established U.S. courts are not the proper jurisdiction for such a hearing."" Khalifa expressed confidence that the PLO and Palestinian Authority will prevail in American courts during its coming appeal. Palestinian leaders are combating ""extremism and violence and maintain a strong commitment to nonviolent resistance and international legal, political and moral redress,"" the spokesman added, claiming that this case doesn't help in this regard. ""This case is just the latest attempt by hardline anti-peace factions in Israel to use and abuse the U.S. legal system to advance their narrow political agenda,"" Khalifa said. ""The decision is a tragic disservice to the millions of Palestinians who have invested in the democratic process and the rule of law in order to seek justice and redress their grievances, and to the international community which has invested so much in financial and political capital in a two-state solution."" The U.S. case dates back to the Second Intifada, or armed uprising, in which Palestinians staged a series of deadly attacks inside Israel. According to figures from Israel's internal security agency, known as the Shin Bet, some 488 Israelis died in suicide attacks between 2001 and 2004. Americans got caught up in some of those attacks, including the dozens listed in the U.S. court case. A few were killed, more were burned or wounded by gunshots or shrapnel, while others suffered ""severe emotional, mental and economic harm,"" according to a related complaint. One such American was Mark Sokolow. On 9/11, the lawyer from New York escaped the World Trade Center before its twin towers collapsed. Then, four months later, he was walking through West Jerusalem when a bomb went off, killing one man and wounding more than 110 people. Sokolow afterward told CNN that he suffered mostly superficial injuries, though his wife's condition was ""a little bit more serious."" ""I feel very fortunate that someone, God, is looking over us to make sure that we're OK,"" he said then. That and other attacks occurred when Yasser Arafat led the Palestinian Authority and as Israeli authorities clamped down on him and his allies. The violence abated when then-PA Prime MInister Mahmoud Abbas began to take over -- a move that became complete with Arafat's death in 2004. Abbas, who has preached nonviolence even as issues with Israel have persisted, has been President now for a decade. The U.S. case was tried in New York because the PLO has an office in New York City, which is home of the United Nations. Even if it did not appeal, the Palestinian Authority would appear hard-pressed to pay damages to the plaintiffs. Israel has played a part in those issues, like its decision to freeze the transfer of more than $127 million in tax revenues collected on behalf of the Palestinians in the wake of their bid to join the International Criminal Court, according to Israel's Haaretz newspaper. Yet this week's decisions isn't just about the Palestinians. Jerry S. Goldman, a lawyer for 9/11 families suing Saudi Arabia and others, thinks it may help in his clients' case as well. ""If you cut off the funding, you cut off the terror,"" Goldman said. ""And U.S. courts are showing that they can handle transnational terror litigation and make powerful individuals, institutions and governments who have materially supported terrorists' pay.""","Palestinian Authority, PLO are ordered to pay over $650 million to dozens of Americans .

"(CNN)In recent weeks, hundreds of thousands of Americans have joined a growing chorus urging Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run for president. I am not endorsing her as a candidate, at this point. But I am excited about the movement that is pushing her candidacy, unlike a whole bunch of Beltway types who have lined up to say how silly the whole notion is. Warren will not run, they cry -- though a draft movement has convinced her before. And even if she did, she would not win -- though no one gave President Obama a chance, either. Still, even if all of the naysayers are somehow on to something, the folks supporting ""Run Warren Run"" -- MoveOn.org, Democracy for America, and the Working Families Party -- and ""Ready for Warren"" have it right. Here is why: . Even Democrats who support other candidates acknowledge that big banks and other special interests have rigged the game in Washington. Our whole party understands that inequality is worse than it has been since the 1920s, and we need to build an economy where everyone has a fighting chance. In fact, it is not just Democratic voters who are emboldened by Warren's fight for working families; her ideas ring true in red states and blue states, in rural parts of America and in big cities like Boston and Chicago. ""I came out of a hardworking, middle-class family,"" Warren often says, in some variation. ""I came from an America that created opportunities for people like me, and I now see an America where the government works for people who already have money and power."" It is, in her own words, ""time to remind politicians that they don't work for the big banks -- they work for us."" That is a voice that would add real value to any party's primary, but especially a party that purports to stand up for working people. Contested primaries feature robust discussions on the most pressing issues facing our nation -- and the best ideas for making America stronger. Now, more than ever, we need those discussions. Many Democrats are voting with Wall Street, while Republicans shout about flat wages. Our country and the Democratic Party deserve a real debate over what we stand for. And there is a great place to have these debates: in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters are ready to ask candidates tough questions and hear their platforms. In the absence of a competitive primary, some have even speculated that there may not be any Democratic debates before the general election. Call me old-fashioned, but I want to nominate a presidential candidate who has answered tough questions on the crucial issues facing hardworking Americans today. Some argue that a vigorously contested primary would actually hurt the Democratic Party, that a competitive primary could split the Democratic base or force the eventual nominee to spend too much time and money too early. In other words, exactly what happened in 2008. Remember how that worked out? Primaries leave candidates fit, tested, experienced and prepared for the grueling general election campaign. And as we saw in 2008, all that organizing leaves the party energized and ready to get to work. The Republican primary will unquestionably be highly competitive. Some analysts are predicting that more than a dozen GOP candidates will mount serious bids for the party's nomination. The eventual Republican nominee will enter the general election in fighting shape, with months of experience winning debates and votes over his or her party allies. If the Republican contest features a spirited debate and the Democratic primary generates no news, the result will be two years of free publicity for right-wing talking points and conservative attacks on President Obama's record, with a battle-ready Republican candidate. I have tremendous respect for Hillary Clinton. And so does most of the Democratic Party. But whether you love Clinton, or would cast your ballot for Warren or someone else, your voice will not truly be heard unless the primary offers a choice. In 2014, Democrats played it safe, avoided offering big ideas and failed to motivate the voters who drove them to victory in 2008 and 2012. To win in 2016, we need to have the progressive base fired up, with progressive causes at the forefront of the political debate. If we rely on those Democratic diehards to win, they deserve an opportunity to make their voices heard during the primaries and caucuses. They deserve a choice. We are at a critical point in our nation's history. Millions of Americans are fighting for justice in their communities. Millions of Americans are calling for economic policies that work for everyone, not just the wealthy few. Millions of Americans are ready to tackle climate change, solve our student debt crisis and ensure women get equal pay for equal work. It is time to fire up the Democratic base, have a robust discussion of the critical issues facing our nation and hear the best ideas from our best candidates.","Van Jones: A Warren candidacy would be good for democracy -- and Democrats .
He says the party needs a contested primary, debates and a full airing of ideas ."
"(CNN) -- Potato salad is a cause worthy of charitable donations. That notion started out as a joke in early July, when Zack ""Danger"" Brown opened a Kickstarter campaign requesting $10 in crowdfunding to make his very first batch of it. But the joke was on him, when an Internet mob pounded him with a sum far beyond his goal -- $55,492. On Saturday, he spent it on a public party in a city park in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, to benefit charity. He says he won't personally pocket any of the loot. The Internet storm also whisked Brown into an overnight sensation. The raging speed of donations snagged the attention of ""Good Morning America"" in a few days' time. The newly minted fund-raiser popped by ABC's morning show studio in shorts and sneakers with no socks, and showed off a cheap T-shirt with homemade iron-on lettering that read, in all caps: ""I JUST BACKED POTATO SALAD."" Too much money . His campaign's dizzying momentum blindsided Brown. ""At Day One, we had $200. I thought that was way too much money,"" he told the show. He confessed that he had not yet made any potato salad but said he'd received many recipes through the Internet -- from mayo-daubed to vinegar-splashed concoctions. Brown's bewilderment over the sum didn't stop him from handily hoisting the fund-raising bar much higher. He pledged prizes for various levels of donation: A bite of the potato salad for those contributing $3. A hat for a contribution of $25. A T-shirt for $35. He added ""stretch"" goals for donors to meet between $35 and $3,000. While the money came in streams, visitors to his Kickstarter page arrived in deluges, tallying more than 4 million views. It ranks No. 4 on the website for all-time visits, according to Kickstarter. Potato salad weighs in ahead of actor LeVar Burton's Reading Rainbow, which ranks eighth, and the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, which ranks 10th. Nevertheless, donations to those campaigns rocketed into lofty millions and dwarf the money given to potato salad. Eating up attention . Brown has reveled in the attention, posting YouTube videos satirizing his cause with an indelible bright-eyed gaze and an upbeat smile on his cleanshaven face. He took the ALS ice bucket challenge by pouring a bucket of potatoes over his head before someone else doused him with ice water. Consistently, Brown thanked the Internet for its charity, personifying and addressing it personally by introducing videos with the salutation, ""Hello, Internet."" Two and a half months after uploading his joke campaign, Brown was sitting on sacks of potatoes and money. He had promised to read off the list of his donors on camera while he made his first potato salad. It took him nearly four hours to read all the names of generous people from 20-some countries -- 6,911 people donated in all. Feeding those in need . Then it came time to do something with all those spuds and all that dough. ""I want to do the most good that I can do with this,"" he had told ""GMA."" But Kickstarter prevents campaigners from turning their cash directly over to charities. To get around that, Brown splurged for a concert bash called PotatoStock 2014 with concession stands and sponsorships, he said on his website, thepotatostock.com. Proceeds from the event went to nonprofits to fight hunger in Central Ohio. Brown invited the entire Internet to the party, and a few people did drive to Columbus from other states, according to Brown's Twitter posts. But for all the global attention, a big chunk of the funding came from close to home. About 90% came from the United States, and donors from Ohio gave the most money, followed by California. Nearly 63% of the Ohio donations were contributed from in and around Columbus, the very area Brown intends to feed. .","Zack ""Danger"" Brown asked on Kickstarter for $10 to make his first batch of potato salad .

"A 30-minute visit by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to a controversial shrine that includes the names of convicted war criminals ignited a predictable firestorm of criticism and condemnation Thursday from Japan's neighbors. The Yasukuni Shrine is regarded by China, North Korea and South Korea as a symbol of Japan's imperial military past. All three countries suffered under Japan's military aggression in World War II. Millions of Chinese civilians and soldiers, and hundreds of thousands of Koreans, died. So, each time a top Japanese official has visited, the countries have protested -- saying the visits honor war criminals and deny Japan's atrocities in Asia. Not so, said Abe on Thursday. He wanted to pray for the souls of the war dead, not honor war criminals, he said. ""I have renewed my determination before the souls of the war dead to firmly uphold the pledge never to wage a war again,"" he said. There are more than 2.4 million names enshrined at Yasukuni. But among them are 14 who were found guilty of war crimes by a military tribunal in Tokyo in 1945. Abe's visit came exactly a year after he took office, during which time he has received the cold shoulder from both Chinese President Xi Jinping and South Korean President Park Geun-hye during regional conferences. It also comes at a time when Japan and China have ratcheted up rhetoric over the ownership of a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyu islands in China and the Senkakus in Japan. Japan and South Korea also have had their own territorial disputes. Perhaps to preempt the outrage over his visit, Abe struck a conciliatory tone afterward. ""It is not my intention at all to hurt the feelings of the Chinese and Korean people,"" he said.  ""It is my wish to respect each other's character, protect freedom and democracy, and build friendship with China and Korea with respect, as did all the previous Prime Minsiters who visited the Yasukuni Shrine."" It was too little too late. Japanese Prime Minister Ab visits controversial Yasukuni war shrine . Immediate outrage . The Chinese foreign ministry immediately issued a tersely worded statement, saying Beijing ""expresses strongest indignation for this act, which heavily offends the Chinese people and people of other Asian countries that were victims of WWII."" ""Honoring the shrine is, in its essence, embellishing and falsely beautifying Japan's military invasion and colonization."" Speaking at a press conference, South Korean Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism said that he cannot help but deplore and express anger and urged Japan to stop ""beautifying"" its invasion. The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said it was disappointed by the visit. ""Japan is a valued ally and friend,"" the embassy said. ""Nevertheless, the United States is disappointed that Japan's leadership has taken an action that will exacerbate tensions with Japan's neighbors."" Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Japan's Temple University, said Japan has made its history into an issue when it should be seeking the cooperation of China and South Korea in dealing with the threat North Korea poses. ""Trampling on the neighbors' sensitivities about their shared past also limits room for managing territorial disputes involving both countries or making headway on a range of other pressing issues,"" he said. A matter of perspective? In his statement after the visit, Abe acknowledged that such visits have become a political and diplomatic issue. But should they be? Depends on the perspective, says J. Berkshire Miller, a fellow on Japan at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Pacific Forum. The Yasukuni shrine remembers Japan's war dead not just from World War II, but also its war against Imperial Germany during World War I and the Satsuma rebellion in the 19th century. In October, several officials, including Abe's brother -- senior vice foreign minister Nobuo Kishi -- visited the shrine, according to Kyodo News. The visits were part of an autumn festival and included 159 members of the Diet, Japan's national legislature. The Prime Minister refrained from visiting the shrine then, but sent an offering. The lawmakers insisted the visits have been misrepresented by the foreign media and that the shrine is where Japanese visitors go to ""pray for peace."" The site, built in 1869, enshrines those who ""devoted their lives to their country,"" the group said at the time. ""The problem for Japan,"" says Miller, ""is that none of this matters to many of its critics.""","Japanese Prime Minister says Japan must never wage war again .

"(CNN) -- Mexico saw the first public protests this weekend over the government's decision to allow cultivation of the first genetically modified corn, which environmentalists and others say could ruin the nation's native crop. A Greenpeace banner protesting genetically modified corn hangs on a Mexico City monument on Sunday. About 45 Greenpeace activists hung a black banner and protest signs Sunday at the Angel of Independence, a victory column in a busy traffic circle on one of Mexico City's major thoroughfares. It is one of Mexico City's most recognized monuments. ""Today, the Angel of Independence is in mourning to demand that the Mexican government protect our principal nourishment -- corn,"" said Aleira Lara, a Greenpeace leader at the protest. The nation's agriculture and environment departments approved two permits last week from among 35 applications to grow the controversial crop. Unlike traditional crops, which are modified through selective breeding, genetically modified crops are engineered by having changes introduced into their DNA. Genetic engineering can improve desired traits such as nutritional content or resistance to herbicides, pests and disease. The modifications also can increase tolerance for cold and drought. Other genetically modified crops include soybeans, cotton and papayas. Critics of the technique say they worry about the effect on consumers, other crops and the environment. Germany earlier this year banned a genetically modified strain of corn, saying the government wanted to protect the safety of consumers and the environment. Mexico said the genetically modified crops are in an experimental phase and will be planted on plots controlled by the government and isolated from other crops. The new crops also will be planted in states that do not grow native corn, which is a major staple of the Mexican diet. Corn is grown on about one-third of the country's cultivated land, mostly in central Mexico. But the Mexican protesters said they fear the genetically modified corn could harm the nation's 55 varieties of native corn. ""Without corn, there is no country,"" some protesters said. The slogan rhymes in Spanish: ""Sin maiz, no hay pais."" Two scientific studies have determined that transgenic corn has already contaminated some native Mexican corn fields. In 2001, a study in the journal Nature reported that transgenic DNA had been found in traditional corn crops in the state of Oaxaca. Earlier this year, research published in the journal Molecular Ecology also found genetically modified corn contamination of native Mexican corn. Signs hung on statues at the protest said: ""Our corn first, traitors"" and ""Transgenic corn: End to independence."" Greenpeace and other critics say that modified corn would kill off independent growers, because they would have to buy their seed from one of four businesses that own the patents. ""Farmers will be beholden to those companies when their fields are contaminated and no producer will be able to plant his seed, like they do now, because they will have to pay royalties to those corporations to plant again,"" protest leader Lara said. In its February article, Molecular Ecology said that most of the current crop in the nation comes from private supplies of seed. ""Maize is a staple food in Mexico, with a pivotal place in the country's past and present economic, cultural and agricultural spheres,"" the article says in its introduction. ""In contrast to the United States and Europe, commercial seed sources account for only one-fourth of the maize seed planted in Mexico. Furthermore, Mexican maize is mostly grown by smallholder farmers who obtain seed from their own harvest or from other farmers."" Molecular Ecology also points out, though, that the ""introduction of transgenic maize has resulted in an increase in maize production."" And it is that increase in production that lies at the heart of Mexico's decision to allow the two test permits, analysts say. ""Mexico is a net importer of corn from the United States,"" said Bruce Bagley, chairman of the University of Miami Graduate School of International Studies. Mexico grows two types of corn: yellow, which is similar to that grown in the United States, and white, which is native to Mexico. The native white corn amounts to roughly 90 percent of the nation's production. Yellow corn makes up the remaining 10 percent. White corn is used for human consumption while yellow corn is used primarily for animal feed. An increase in meat and chicken consumption in Mexico in the past decade has led to greater demand for yellow corn for animal feed. Unable to meet this demand, Mexico has had to import about 89 percent of the corn it needs for feed, says the U.S. Agriculture Department. And 99.8 percent of that corn comes from the United States, the department says. ""Mexico wants to produce enough crops so they don't have to import foods,"" said Susan Kaufman Purcell, director of the Center for Hemispheric Policy at the University of Miami. ""Greater yields will lead to not having to import as much food from the United States."" There are other factors, such as increasingly common food shortages throughout the world that have driven up prices. The price of corn, for example, has more than doubled since 2007. That prompted about 70,000 people to take to the streets of Mexico last year to protest the price of tortillas, which jumped through the roof in January 2008. ""Mexico is feeling the pangs of food insecurity,"" Bagley said. Greater corn production and less importation also would ease the nation's balance of payments. Bagley also sees another reason why Mexico may have allowed introduction of the genetically modified corn. The United States has pressured Mexico strongly to accept the modified crop, Bagley said. Mexico has acquiesced due to provisions in the North American Free Trade Agreement. But if the experimental plots lead to greater contamination of native crops, Bagley said, Mexico could have the legal grounds to refuse widespread importation of the new corn. Greenpeace doesn't want to wait that long. The global environmental organization asked Mexico for an immediate moratorium on the use of the transgenic corn. There has been no indication they're likely to get it any time soon.","Mexico last week approved two applications to grow genetically modified corn .

"(CNN)I wasn't surprised the Confederation of African Football (CAF) suspended host Morocco from its most prestigious tournament -- the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) -- as the continent grappled with the Ebola crisis. It is important to take Ebola seriously, but Morocco took too long to make a decision and the North African nation had various options to control the risk, notably preventing fans from West Africa from entering the country. AFCON is still one of the world's most important football tournaments and a sudden cancellation would have been ridiculous. The health of a continent is more important than any football tournament, but given the distance from Morocco to where the disease is most prevalent, the risk posed to the North African nation would have been small. Morocco offered to host the tournament the following year, but to have staged competitions in successive years -- 2016 and 2017 -- would have caused a huge rumpus with European clubs. Of course, an AFCON should be played on African soil, but would offering it to Qatar have been a better solution? New host Equatorial Guinea -- the right choice? For CAF to give the tournament to Equatorial Guinea, however, was a controversial decision. Western officials cite Equatorial Guinea as an example of a resource-rich country that is plagued by kleptocracy problems. President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo has been in power since 1979 and the vast majority of his citizens live in poverty. In recent years, anti-corruption groups have tried to draw attention to the ruling family's assets in Europe and the United States. In 2012, Equatorial Guinea co-hosted AFCON. I attended that tournament and it worked out, but remember Gabon was the co-host as well and that made a huge difference. But CAF didn't have a lot of options. Africa isn't like Europe where you clap your hands and you have 10 countries willing to host a major tournament. As they say, TIA -- ""This is Africa."" To be honest CAF was lucky to find a replacement on that short notice. ""CAF wishes to express its sincere thanks to the Equatorial Guinean people, its government and particularly president Obiang,"" said CAF president Issa Hayatou in a statement. ""To agree to organize a competition like this two months before the event, you must admit you really have to be a true African."" But CAF could still face problems. Equatorial Guinea has two great stadiums, but the other two are not of international standard. It will be very difficult to host a tournament with similar conditions for all teams. The government will have to put in a lot of effort just to provide at least a normal playing surface. Equatorial Guinea's infrastructure could also present problems. There are a few decent roads between the airport and the stadium or from city to city, but that's not the case for the rest of the country. Will there be enough hotels and accommodation for the 16 teams, officials and international press? Participants need to be prepared to improvise, but it will be a big challenge for everybody involved. Power cuts are a normal part of life in West Africa, so it's not unusual that stars playing for Europe's top clubs will have to take a cold shower or spend time in hotels without electricity, walking around with flashlights or candles. Many international fans wonder why African stars would accept such conditions. The reason is simple: All Africans are proud to represent their country and are honored to play at AFCON, even if they have to play on a bumpy pitch or are living in a less-than-luxurious hotel. For me that's really impressive, touching even, when you realize how much it means to these guys to carry the flag for their country. Don't expect African players to crumble under any pressure from European clubs asking them not to travel to the tournament because of Ebola. The players believe that they have to fight this illness by showing some solidarity. Uncomfortable atmosphere? When I have been to Equatorial Guinea you often feel the locals aren't that keen to communicate with foreigners. The constant presence of military and police armed with rifles creates an uncomfortable atmosphere. When I was at the tournament in 2012, my local driver was punched in his face with a gun because he asked politely if he could drop me and my cameraman closer to the stadium. That was one reason why I felt more comfortable in Gabon. I expect the attendances in Equatorial Guinea to be strong because the locals are big football fans. And if the government wants the stadiums to be full then people are most likely to go there. Africans view Equatorial Guinea's national team somewhat critically, given it has too many naturalized players -- many were born in Spain, Colombia, Ivory Coast and Cameroon. Equatorial Guinea's participation also signals a remarkable turnaround in its fortunes, following the team's suspension from the competition for fielding an ineligible player earlier this year. A crazy draw -- who are the favorites? AFCON offers a strange mix of football. Within two minutes you can witness everything from amateur level to world-class ability. You see unbelievable skills and seconds later you shake your head about a mistake you wouldn't even see in the lowest leagues. The weaker teams are no better than German third-division level, but with teams like Ivory Coast you see plenty of players who earn their money at top clubs. However, the level, especially in the tactical area, has improved drastically over the last four tournaments. Algeria is my tip to win the tournament. It's a team that had a fantastic World Cup, a convincing qualification campaign and a team where it's hard to spot any weakness. Algeria is a team that plays European football, is disciplined and physical, and has plenty of experience. Ghana is a contender because of the individual class of players like Asamoah Gyan and many others. It's a shame that Nigeria -- the current African champions -- didn't qualify for the tournament. Nigerian coach Stephen Keshi always managed to field a team with a good mixture of overseas-based players and local youngsters. The Super Eagles will be sorely missed. I can't see a surprise winner like Zambia in 2012. It was a once-in-a-lifetime fairytale when a team of unknown players beat sides like Ghana and Ivory Coast against all the odds. Senegal, with my good friend Alain Giresse in charge, is a team that could potentially go all the way. Its physical strength is known to anybody who watches African football, but Alan has formed a unit which has also improved tactically. Equatorial Guinea has a decent side but it's not a team that has the level required to become African champions. Fans . One of the big differences between the European Championship and AFCON is the attendance and the atmosphere in the stadiums. Why do you see so many empty seats in the stadiums? Africa is a huge continent and connections from one country to the other by plane, train or car can be quite complicated and can take hours or even days. The travel costs are also very expensive and sometimes connections between African countries are easier with a stopover in Europe. Likewise, an average African worker would never be able to afford the airfare, while accommodation can be completely overpriced. A very average hotel room during the 2010 AFCON was sometimes more than $500. Ticket prices at AFCON are also too high for fans. A normal ticket costs many times more than local fans would normally pay for tickets at a domestic league game. Average African fans just can't afford to pay such prices for a football game. Poverty forces people to buy food or medication instead of spending crazy money on a football match. Every match of the host nation is traditionally a sell-out crowd, and as long as the host is still in the tournament, the attendances are decent. But when the home team is eliminated, you sometimes get the feeling that the football in the country has just died, with local supporters losing immediate interest in the tournament. These days, African fan culture gravitates towards many of them supporting European teams. So much so, that the English Premier League means much more to African fans than AFCON. Who cares to watch Guinea against Senegal if you can see Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool or Arsenal at the same time on television? African football, therefore, has a real struggle competing against the major European leagues, with Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar now the true idols of African fans.","2015 Africa Cup of Nations gets under way Saturday .

"(CNN)Prominent Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel-Fattah was sentenced Monday to five years in prison and fined $13,000 on charges of protesting and assaulting police. Eighteen others were sentenced to three years in prison and also fined $13,000 each. The case dates back to November 2013 when the controversial protest law was issued by the government. Dozens demonstrated against the military trial of civilians outside the Shoura Council where the committee writing the country's constitution was meeting. Police later dispersed the crowd and arrested dozens of activists. It was the first day the law had come into effect. Police accused demonstrators of failing to acquire permission. Activists who refuse to recognize the legislation say the police violated the law by using excessive force. Ahmed Abdel-Rahman -- who, like Abdel-Fattah, was also sentenced to 5 years -- was not a protester, but a bystander who intervened to protect women assaulted by plainclothes policemen that day, lawyers told the court. ""It doesn't make any sense. (Egpytian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi) says yesterday 'I'm going to release the young people' and today we get these sentences,"" said Khaled Dawood, spokesman of the Constitution Party, in reference to el-Sisi's speech the night before in which he announced the imminent release of youth wrongfully held in prisons. Dawood told CNN this and similar sentences contribute to the closure of political space and dissuade youth from constructive political engagement. The 24 defendants were previously sentenced to 15 years. This was their retrial, seen by the same judge presiding over the Al Jazeera journalists' retrial. Five defendants didn't file the appeal, were tried in absentia and consequently their 15-year sentences were upheld. One final stage of appeal is left. Abdel-Fattah, one of the leading opposition voices, was repeatedly imprisoned by consecutive regimes. It's the first time he has been convicted. Several other prominent activists -- including his youngest sister Sanaa and Ahmed Maher, co-founder of the April 6 Youth Movement -- have been convicted of violating the protest law.","Alaa Abdel-Fattah, one of the leading opposition voices in Egypt, gets a 5-year sentence .

"We pay a lot of attention to revolutions when they emerge suddenly and violently, but when a transformation arrives gradually and peacefully it's easy to miss. Let's stop for a moment and take a look at a slow-motion development changing the world as we know it: The United States is giving up its addiction to foreign oil. For decades, we bemoaned the awful toll this addiction has taken. The need for oil and natural gas -- much of it from Middle Eastern dictatorships -- shaped the foundation of global geopolitics. It created morally questionable alliances and repeatedly placed Washington in a position to choose between its fundamental values and its economic interests. Now all that could change. When President Obama started his first term, the country faced stiff economic headwinds. Now, as he prepares to start his second term, the country enjoys a rare and unexpected tailwind, propelling it in one of the most important areas, with a host of positive implications. Clearly, the booming American oil and gas businesses are not problem-free, but the benefits -- economic, geopolitical and environmental -- of this impending energy independence far outweigh the drawbacks. The days when Mideast oil-producing dictatorships and their friends at OPEC could so easily wave their power over a trembling, oil-thirsty West are on their way to becoming a relic of the past. America still needs imported oil. But growing production and shrinking consumption have created a most promising trend. According to the International Energy Agency, the United States will become the world's leading oil producer in just a few years. Imagine that. The United States could produce more oil than Saudi Arabia as early as 2017 and become a net oil exporter by 2030. And if you count other petroleum products, the future is already here. In 2011, the United States exported more petroleum products -- including gasoline, diesel and other fuels -- than it imported. That had not happened in more than half a century. David Frum: A tax we could learn to love . The first major sign of impact is visible in Iran. The loosening of oil markets has strengthened the world's hand against oil-rich Iran. One main reason the international community has been able to impose strong sanctions on Tehran, aimed at persuading the regime to stop its illegal nuclear enrichment program, is that the global economy can do without Iranian oil. Iran's production has fallen 40%, a drop that not long ago would have created unacceptable economic hardships for the rest of the planet. The trend is even more dramatic when you include natural gas, a product that is revolutionizing energy markets. The United States is about to become the second-largest exporter of natural gas behind Russia. Gigantic oil and gas finds in the United States and elsewhere are transforming the landscape, in some cases quite literally. Other than rising oil prices, the reason for this shift is that new and controversial technologies such as fracking and horizontal drilling have multiplied the amount of viable deposits in unexpected places. The techniques take an environmental toll, but there are upsides. Fracking, as we keep learning, is creating very troubling problems, which deserve  scrutiny. But it is helping to replace coal, the dirtiest form of energy production, with much cleaner natural gas. Another dark lining in this silver cloud is that cheaper oil and gas will reduce incentives to produce green energies. Rather than abandoning the new sources of energy, efforts should focus on finding ways to reduce the negative impact of fracking and on continuing the push for alternative energy. Fracking protesters say drilling jobs not worth environmental risks . The Obama administration now faces a balancing act as it starts its new term. Energy policy, the quest for full energy independence, must be weighed against the growing threat of climate change. A decision on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline is imminent and political pressure against fracking will grow. The president should support strong climate legislation, without reversing the powerful gains of surging U.S. oil and gas production, with all its transformational benefits. The two goals are not mutually exclusive. Once upon a time, America was the Saudi Arabia of whale oil, the fuel of its day. Whale oil was displaced by hydrocarbon production, which the United States also dominated. That started changing with enormous geopolitical consequences after easy, high quality oil was found in the Arabian Peninsula and other parts of the Middle East. The United States built alliances with autocratic regimes as part of a commitment to satisfy its needs and preserve the free flow of oil, which became the life-blood of the global economy. For oil-rich countries, this brought enormous fortunes, but it also brought something known as the ""resource curse."" With wealth concentrated in the hands of autocrats, corruption mushroomed, and other sectors of the economy withered. A trend away from the concentration of oil production in such an unstable, undemocratic part of the world bodes well. It bodes well for human rights, and it also bodes well, ironically, for the economies of oil-rich countries, which may at long last find an incentive to diversify into other industries. It certainly bodes well for the U.S. economy, which is already creating tens of thousands of jobs in industries related to the new boom. William Bennett: Damon's film overlooks fracking's boon . In what sounds like something from another era, the Energy Information Administration  forecast declining gasoline prices for the next few years. That's the first bit of good news for American consumers. The really good news is the knowledge that soon, every time you fill up your tank you will not be sending a piece of your paycheck to the Middle East. That, among other things, is excellent news for America's balance of trade and for the soundness of the U.S. economy, which sadly now struggles with a politically dysfunctional Washington. No matter how much oil the United States and its friends in the Western Hemisphere produce, the Middle East remains a principal global petroleum producer for the foreseeable future. The United States still needs to ensure the free flow of oil, because a stop in production will cause prices to spike on global markets, affecting the entire planet. But America and its friends are becoming much less vulnerable to oil shocks. And supplies from other parts of the world are becoming more plentiful. The emerging changes in the world's energy markets, if they continue to develop, are nothing short of revolutionary. As Obama prepares for a new term in office, they are gradually rerouting us from a destiny that we had thought was inescapable and rather dismal to one that, while far from assured, looks much more promising.","Frida Ghitis: The U.S. will become the world's leading oil producer in a few years .
Ghitis: It is truly transformational that the U.S. is giving up its addiction to foreign oil .
Despite energy independence, we need to keep looking into green energy, she says .

"(CNN)Ever feel like that laundry pile never gets smaller or the kitchen never stays clean, especially when children are around? Florida mother Esther Anderson knows the feeling well thanks to 15-month-old Ellia. Whenever she turns her back on a neatly folded stack of clothing or a dust pile it's only a matter of seconds before Ellia steps in, sending her mother back to square one. Rather than despair, Anderson decided to make light of those moments by turning them into an 1:21 video delighting viewers worldwide. Since being posted on her Facebook page last Wednesday, the video has been viewed more than 68 million times and shared from her page more than two million times. ""I just wanted to show that this is part of life being a mom,"" said Anderson, who documents her adventures as a first-time mother on her blog, ""Story of This Life."" ""Babies tear things up and take them apart; they unravel your life. Something would be wrong if they didn't. You would be a helicopter mom."" The idea for the video began in the laundry room. As Anderson moved clothes from the washer to the dryer Ellia intervened. Anderson fetched her DSLR camera, set it up in front of the machines and went back to work, letting Ellia do her worst as she filmed the results. She repeated the process the next day in the kitchen. As she attempted to sweep the floor and unload the dishwasher, she indulged Ellia's mischief longer than she normally would for the sake of the camera, and to prove a point: ""At the end of the day you look at your house and it looks like you've done nothing all day long."" But that's OK. ""Moms around the world are dealing with the same stuff,"" she said. ""I think that's why the video has been so popular. You don't have to be American or speak English to know this is what kids do."" And, we love them anyway. Right?",Video of Esther Anderson's mischievous daughter was viewed more than 68 million times .
"Hong Kong (CNN)On the Korean peninsula, the jittery season is here. Joint military exercises conducted by South Korea and the United States each spring start this week. The drills, involving thousands of troops and state of the art military hardware, don't go down well with North Korea. It fired two short-range ballistic missiles into the East Sea, also known as the Sea of Japan, on Monday morning after slamming the exercises as ""dangerous nuclear war drills for invading the DPRK."" ""Each year, Pyongyang complains and demands a stop to these annual exercises, which it claims to be offensive in nature,"" said Sung-Yoon Lee, a professor of Korean studies at Tufts University. ""North Korea has complained vociferously at least over the past quarter century."" So what's at stake? We take a closer look at the drills and the tensions that surround them. The United States and South Korea stress that the exercises, named Foal Eagle and Key Reserve, are defensive and non-provocative in nature. The North Korean regime, however, doesn't see it that way, and its state media has characterized the drills as rehearsals for an attack. Leader Kim Jong Un called for full combat readiness and oversaw military facilities, according to KCNA. ""The North Koreans, being paranoid in their own way, have always had this concern: 'If there is going to be an invasion, this would be the time,'"" said Philip Yun, executive director of the Ploughshares Fund, a group that advocates nuclear disarmament. ""But that's not the intent on the U.S.-South Korean side."" In March 2013, the North Korean military went as far as claiming that the United States was carrying out the drills with the aim ""to mount a preemptive nuclear strike together with its South Korean puppet forces."" Playing up the threat also helps the North Korean leadership's propaganda efforts to control the population of the isolated nation, according to Yun. As well as providing practice for the forces involved, the exercises send a message that the United States ""would defend South Korea in the case of a North Korean invasion,"" said Tong Kim, a visiting scholar at the U.S.-Korea Institute, part of Johns Hopkins University. Usually, with a lot of angry rhetoric and a series of weapons tests. Near the start of the year, North Korea typically demands the cancellation of the exercises. Threats of doom and the firing of short-range rockets or missiles into the sea tend to become routine as the military exercises approach. That was underscored this year on February 8 when North Korea fired five short-range missiles into the East Sea, according to the South Korean Defense Ministry. The barrage into the waters, also known as the Sea of Japan, came just a day after the North announced it had successfully tested a ""cutting-edge"" anti-ship missile. The U.S. and South Korean militaries announced Tuesday that the exercises will run from March 2 to April 24. Some furious statements from North Korea followed, including a statement on KCNA that the drills were a smokscreen to ""to cover up their surprise invasion of the north."" Pyongyang's outrage ignores the fact that its forces carry out their own drills each winter that analysts view as offensively minded. Yes, amid nuclear negotiations with Pyongyang in early and mid-1990s, Washington held off on the drills several times. ""There is precedent, we have done this before,"" said Yun. But he qualified that ""circumstances have changed significantly since that period of time."" North Korea has determinedly pressed on with its nuclear weapons program, thumbing its nose at the international outcry. It has carried out a series of underground tests and launching long-range rockets that could be used as intercontinental missiles. In January, Pyongyang suggested it would halt nuclear tests if the United States canceled the joint drills, drawing a sharp response from Marie Harf, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman. ""The offer, as I understand it, which we see as an implicit threat, is for the U.S. to stop doing something that is routine, that is transparent, that is defensive in nature, and that is annual ... in exchange for the North Koreans not doing something that is prohibited under multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions and that they are not supposed to be doing,"" Harf said. ""That's really a false choice here."" The tone was set by North Korea's long-range rocket test in December 2012, followed by its third nuclear test two months later. The United Nations responded with sanctions, and Pyongyang continued to ramp up its threats of nuclear war against South Korea and the United States. One North Korean government website even uploaded a YouTube video showing an imaginary missile attack on Washington. The U.S. decision to fly B-2 stealth bombers, which are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, over the region only served to further antagonize North Korea amid the annual military drills. ""That was a really bad escalation of the tensions in the Korean peninsula,"" Tong Kim said of the period. But Pyongyang's decisions to carry out the rocket launch and nuclear test were most likely carefully timed, according to Yun, who was part of U.S. teams that negotiated with North Korea under former President Bill Clinton. ""They game everything out. They don't do things off the cuff for the most part,"" he said of the North Koreans. ""If they're going to do something very provocative, they have an extensive decision tree laying out many options."" The moves appeared to be aimed at advancing North Korea's technology and making Kim Jong Un, still a relatively new leader, look strong inside the country, Yun said. They also coincided with political transitions in South Korea, China and Japan. Predicting the secretive North Korean regime's next move is a notoriously difficult game. Last spring, its behavior was less provocative than in 2013, although it did fire off a series of weapons that included medium-range ballistic missiles. Tong Kim said that he didn't expect a new nuclear test or long-range missile launch this year, but that short-range missile firings could be a possibility. An escalation of rhetoric around the military exercises is also likely. Lee was less optimistic about the near future, saying that, if a major provocation takes place, ""no one should be surprised."" ""North Korea has shown itself to be calculating and strategically minded,"" he said. ""There's a political need to raise the stakes, there's probably a technical need to test a long-range missile or a nuclear test -- it's been a couple of years."" Yun said he was concerned that a miscalculation in an already sensitive area, like the disputed waters off the Korean peninsula's west coast, could lead to a rapid escalation of tensions. ""There are a lot of things that can happen with a significant number of military assets around and on the peninsula,"" he said. Kim Jong Un is ""similar in action but stronger in rhetoric"" than his father, Tong Kim said. ""Except that North Korea under Kim Jong Un has newer and more formidable weapons."" Some of the techniques seen under Kim Jong Un certainly recall those employed during his father's rule. During the tensions in early 2013, North Korea declared that the armistice agreement that halted the Korean War in 1953 was no longer valid. The announcement sounded unsettling, but North Korea had already said in 2009 that its military was no longer bound by the armistice because South Korea was joining a U.S.-led anti-proliferation plan. In 2013, the North also tried using the silent treatment, cutting off a military hotline with the South. That was similar to an approach it had adopted in 2009 when it stopped responding to calls after the military exercises started. But during 14 years of Kim Jong Il's rule, the United States and South Korea ""had a track record of what North Korea would do and a sense of what to expect,"" Yun said. ""Kim Jong Un was new, you didn't know how far he would go, which added to the uncertainty.""","Thousands of U.S. and South Korean troops are preparing to conduct their annual military drills .
North Korea views them as provocative despite carrying out its own military exercises .
Analysts believe Pyongyang uses the ""threat"" from the drills for its own propaganda efforts at home ."

"(CNN)With reports that violence in Ukraine is spreading beyond separatist-controlled areas, it is clear the so-called Minsk-II ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian rebels in the Donbas is teetering. If the United States wants to avoid the prospect of the violence spilling over into a broader conflict, it will need to keep the option of more direct involvement -- including the provision of arms -- firmly on the table. Until recently, the White House has understandably been focused on countering the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, a reality that allowed the Europeans (especially Germany) to take the lead in crafting a response to Russia's aggression. But this U.S. reluctance to take center stage has allowed the Russians to exploit splits within Europe in the knowledge that the EU states would not fight force with force. That was until serious talk of potential U.S. lethal military assistance to Kiev upended the conversation. The U.S. debate over providing arms to Ukraine was sparked in part by a report by a number of former senior officials calling for the U.S. to provide $3 billion in aid, including weapons, to the Ukrainian military. Top administration officials, including new Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, then hinted that they favored arming Kiev. Indeed, following his meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on February 9, even President Barack Obama noted that he was considering ""all options,"" presumably including lethal military assistance, should diplomacy fail. True, this openness to providing arms left Obama at odds with Merkel and many other European leaders, who feared it would escalate the conflict. But it also increased the pressure on Merkel and French President Francois Hollande to press for a deal to avoid what they feared might be a bigger conflict, fueled by U.S. weapons. The prospect of U.S. military assistance also no doubt affected the Russian calculation. As skeptics of the argument for lethal assistance pointed out, even with U.S. weapons, Ukraine's military would never be able to defeat Russian regulars, while Moscow's ability to arm the separatists would always outstrip Washington's ability to arm the Ukrainian government. Yet even if U.S. weapons would not reach Ukrainian forces for months, the very commitment to provide them would insert the United States much more directly into the conflict. That commitment, more than the weapons themselves, is what could be a game changer. Opponents of arming Ukraine have argued that weapons, even in fairly small quantities, could easily become the first step down a slippery slope of escalation. They are right, of course. But they also miss the bigger political context. The question is less whether some anti-tank missiles could turn the tide in the Donbas, and more what the decision to provide those missiles would say about Washington's commitment to the fight for Ukraine and against Russia. Russian forces could expand their involvement in the conflict in response to a U.S. commitment to arm Kiev. But, to turn the skeptics' argument about weapons provoking Russian escalation on its head: then what? Once it had committed to arming Ukraine, would Washington allow the Ukrainians to be completely defeated? Would it pour arms into Ukraine until Russian forces faced an insurgency like the one that drove them from Afghanistan in the 1980s and helped bring down the Soviet Union? Would it impose truly drastic economic sanctions, cutting Russia off from global payment networks or bringing down the Russian banking system? Left to themselves, the Europeans would be reluctant go down this path, but would likely do so should Moscow expand the conflict in the face of a wider U.S. role. And the reality is that despite Russian President Vladimir Putin's bellicose rhetoric, no sane Russian believes Moscow could win a protracted fight with the United States. While Russian officials are keen to portray the U.S. as a declining power, in their more honest moments they appreciate the reality of U.S. financial and military power (perhaps more than many in the Obama administration do) and are keen to avoid a test of strength they cannot win. That is why Washington's aversion to lethal assistance and outsourcing the search for a solution in Ukraine to the Europeans was a mistake. While better than letting Ukraine fight a losing war on its own, the Minsk agreement remains heavily tilted in Moscow's favor, even if it holds. Earlier, and more assertive U.S. involvement (including a commitment to provide military assistance), would likely have produced a better, and quicker agreement. As it is, lethal assistance from the United States should remain on the table, along with the prospect of more drastic sanctions, as long as the ceasefire remains tenuous. As Moscow fully understands, only the United States can confront Russia on its own terms. And if Washington truly cares about the success of Ukraine's transformation and checking Russia's revisionist aspirations, it needs to insert itself more squarely into the process, including with its hard power capabilities. Above all, Washington must continue being the main underwriter of European security. The Kremlin knows that confronting the U.S. is much different from confronting the divided, economically vulnerable Europeans. Hopefully, the White House does as well.​ .","Violence continues despite the ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and rebels .

"(CNN)Three teenage British girls suspected of traveling from London to Turkey with the goal of joining ISIS are now believed to have made it to their target country -- war-torn Syria -- London's Metropolitan Police said Tuesday. Police didn't elaborate, other than to say in a statement that they ""now have reason to believe that (the girls) are no longer in Turkey"" and have crossed into neighboring Syria, parts of which have been taken over by the Islamist terror group. If true, that would unsuccessfully end British and Turkish authorities' efforts to find the teens in Turkey before they could cross the Turkish-Syrian border. British police announced last week that three east London classmates -- Shamima Begum, 15; Kadiza Sultana, 16; and Amira Abase, 15 -- had flown aboard a Turkish Airlines plane from London's Gatwick Airport to Istanbul on February 17. The next day, police contacted foreign liaison officers at the Turkish Embassy in London, a Scotland Yard spokesman said. A British counterterrorism officer said police had been ""reaching out to the girls using the Turkish media and social media"" in an effort to persuade them to return home. The girls' parents also publicly begged for them to come home. Earlier Tuesday, a top Turkish official blamed British authorities for the girls' disappearance. ""It is condemnable and shameful on the part of Britain that three girls can just go from Heathrow Airport to Istanbul,"" Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc told reporters in Ankara on Tuesday, naming a different airport of departure than British police. Arinc accused British authorities of waiting three days before telling Turkish counterparts that the missing girls had flown to Istanbul. That would be two later than British police had said, though it's not clear exactly when top officials in Turkey -- not just at its embassy in England -- learned what was happening. ""The search efforts are ongoing. If we can find them, great. If not, then it is the British authorities who are responsible, not Turkey,"" Arinc added. In the days before they left for Turkey, at least one of the three girls allegedly contacted a young woman, Aqsa Mahmood, who left her home in Scotland to travel to Syria in 2013 and is accused of seeking to recruit others via social media. Aamer Anwar, an attorney for the Mahmood family, told CNN on Tuesday that the family was ""somewhat surprised, horrified"" that that contact had not prompted police action, ""because they understood that Aqsa's social media content was being closely monitored by the security services in this country."" ""And the real concern that arises is that if a known member of ISIS who's now a poster girl for ISIS, seen to be recruiting and spreading propaganda, is in touch with young people in our country -- that one would expect the courtesy of a knock on the door of these families, to advise them that their children may be on the cusp of radicalization or going off to Syria."" The Mahmood family released a statement over the weekend in which they condemned their daughter's actions, saying: ""Your actions are a perverted and evil distortion of Islam."" But they also said the UK security services ""have serious questions to answer"" over their failure to intervene after one or more of the missing girls was in touch with Aqsa via Twitter. ""Sadly despite all the government's rhetoric on ISIS, if they cannot even take basic steps to stop children leaving to join ISIS, what is the point of any new laws?"" the statement asked. Anwar also queried how the three girls were able, as unaccompanied minors, to go through airport security controls and board a flight to Turkey -- known to be a transit route to Syria -- without any questions being asked. Despite their condemnation of her actions, Aqsa Mahmood's parents still hope she will return safely one day. She remains in intermittent contact with them through social media but won't answer questions, Anwar said. Her messages are mostly ""extremely religious"" in nature and justifying what she's doing. ""They are just literally hanging on to her words, hoping that she's alive when the contact comes through, that she hasn't been killed by a drone or a bomb or whatever,"" he said of her parents. Turkey has become the most traveled route for volunteers trying to join Syria's many armed factions since an anti-government uprising erupted in Syria more than three years ago. Initially, Ankara maintained an ""open door policy,"" allowing hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees to flee to safety in Turkey.  At the same time, Turkish border guards looked the other way, taking few steps to stop activists, volunteers and journalists from crossing into Syria. But with the rise of the ultra-violent Islamist group ISIS in Syria, the Turkish government increasingly came under criticism at home and abroad for not doing enough to stop jihadists from going through Turkey to get into Syria. Some critics have accused Ankara of actively supporting ISIS against rival Kurdish rebel groups, charges the Turkish government has angrily denied. Last year, the Turkish government showed CNN new barricades, thermal cameras and fences aimed at better fortifying the border. Historically, the Turkish-Syrian border, which runs more than 800 kilometers (500 miles), has been notoriously difficult for Turkish security forces to control. Before the Syrian civil war, both smugglers and Kurdish separatist guerrillas were known to operate illegally between the two countries. Turkish government officials have bristled in response to accusations that they are not stemming the flow of foreign fighters joining ISIS. Millions of tourists visit Turkey every year, where visas can be obtained upon arrival for citizens of many countries. In a report on border security released last year, the Turkish Prime Minister's office said, ""It is easier to prevent people suspected of being members of radical groups from entering into Turkey than it is to prevent them from exiting from the Syrian border of Turkey."" A spokesman for the Turkish President said British and Turkish security forces and intelligence agents are now working together to try to find the three British girls.

"(CNN)Presumed dead by some, the actual fate of the aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un remains unconfirmed because of the secretive nature of that country. Last year, a North Korean defector said that Kim Kyung Hee had died from a stroke while arguing on the phone with the North Korean leader about her husband's execution. The defector's claims were widely reported, but doubts have persisted. Lawmakers in neighboring South Korea told the news agency Yonhap Tuesday that the country's National Intelligence Service reported there is no evidence that Kim Kyung Hee died. It is believed that she is still alive, a South Korean government source told CNN. CNN could not verify claims of Kim Kyung Hee's fate. Kim Kyung Hee is the sister of Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader who died a little more than three years ago and left his son in power. Her husband, Jang Song Thaek, was executed in December 2013, shocking many observers around the world. Before his execution, he was described as the second-most powerful figure in North Korea. But the young leader turned his back on Jang in spectacular fashion, having him executed on charges that he tried to overthrow the government. CNN's Paula Hancocks and KJ Kwon contributed to this report.","A North Korean defector said last year Kim Kyung Hee had died .

"For many tourists, Morocco is best known for its historic cities, rugged landscape and sumptuous cuisine. But for surfers, it's fast becoming known for the crashing waves that pound its Atlantic coastline. For decades, fish has been big business in Essaouira, the charming, former Portuguese settlement on the west coast of Morocco. As stocks have depleted, however, the locals have started to shift their focus to more lucrative industries. While the seas no longer possess the riches they once did, for many inhabitants, they still represent a lifeline -- only now the biggest catch is the tourists riding the waves. Abdullah Aitdir is one of those who have taken advantage of this business opportunity. His father ran a grocery store in the nearby village of Taghazout, which Aitdir has converted into a surf school. ""Surfing is more profitable,"" he explains. ""Even if it's seasonal, it's still good."" In recent years he has seen a move towards a more organized, better regulated surfing industry. ""It used to be chaos,"" says Aitdir. ""Everyone would just come and try to [enter] the surfing industry without paying any taxes, and there were no regulations. Now, there are more rules,"" he adds. With Morocco boasting more than 300 sunshine days a year and 1,800 km of coastline, it's little wonder that surfing is proving profitable.

"(CNN)A week after the mayor of Caracas, Antonio Ledezma, was incarcerated by the Venezuelan government, his youngest daughter is speaking out and demanding his release. The last time Antonieta Ledezma, 23, saw her father was in early January when she left Venezuela bound for New York.  At the time, her teary-eyed dad embraced her and asked, ""When will I see you again? Promise me you will take care of yourself,"" she wrote in an open letter published earlier this week. Ledezma says she never imagined that in just a few weeks seeing her father again would become a matter of not ""when"" but ""if."" ""He was unjustly imprisoned and has effectively been kidnapped by this government,"" said Ledezma, who was joined by a few dozen protesters Monday night in New York's Times Square. ""The world needs to know what my country and what my family is going through,"" she said. In the midst of a deepening economic crisis, the outspoken mayor of Venezuela's capital and largest city, is the latest in a growing list of opposition leaders who have been arrested and jailed by the country's socialist government. On orders of President Nicolas Maduro, federal agents stormed into Ledezma's office on Thurdsay, accusing him of conspiracy and helping to plot an American-backed coup. As the small crowd of protesters in Times Square broke into chants of ""Viva Venezuela"" and ""This government will fall,"" Ledezma vehemently denied the charges levied against her father. ""My dad has been accused of conspiracy. He is a man who wants the freedom of my country. That is the only thing that he has done,"" she said.  ""There is no explanation. My dad is the mayor of a city, and the government has not only disrespected him but all of his human rights."" Venezuelan government officials in New York did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Although she has not been able to speak or see her father since his arrest, Ledezma believes that he remains in good spirits. ""He's trying to stay strong. He has an unbreakable spirit, and his only fear at this moment is losing the country that he loves. The government may have incarcerated his body but never his thoughts and ideas."" Ledezma's supporters fear that he will face the same fate as some of Venezuela's other dissident political prisoners, most notably, Leopoldo Lopez. Lopez, a former mayoral and presidential candidate, has been in jail for over a year, accused of inciting violence during last year's anti-government protests. ""We know this could be a long process, but we are prepared for that. We will not let the abuses of this government weaken us,"" said Ledezma. ""My father's message from prison to Venezuelans and the world is that our country is going through a horrible time, but we are a strong people and he is going to keep fighting."" Maduro maintains that Lopez, Ledezma and other opposition leaders were arrested by order of the attorney general's office and must be tried for ""crimes against the peace, security and constitution of the country.""  Critics, however, say that the government is systematically cracking down on the opposition to deflect attention from the flailing economy. Since Maduro took office, inflation is at an all-time high, 68%, and falling oil prices have had a ripple effect on the country's already ailing economy.  The International Monetary Fund predicts its economy will shrink by 7% this year, the worst in Latin America. ""It is a desperate act by a desperate regime that is seeking to veil the current social and political reality in Venezuela,"" said ex-Venezuelan ambassador to the United Nations, Diego Arria, of Ledezma's arrest. Arria joined Ledezma's daughter at Monday night's rally. ""To kidnap the mayor of Venezuela's capital, no less, is unprecedented, and it will have consequences,"" said Arria. In the meantime, Ledezma remains hopeful that she will once again be able to embrace her father as a free man. ""Hope is the last thing you lose. I know my dad will be free. His cause is now my cause."" Venezuela arrests opposition figures: Why you should care .","Antonieta Ledezma is joined by a few dozen protesters in New York's Times Square .

"(CNN)Last week, UCLA Medical Center notified 179 patients that it had potentially exposed them to a fearsome ""superbug,"" and urged them to get tested. The hospital accidentally infected seven people in procedures involving specialized endoscopes, called duodenoscopes, that proved difficult to thoroughly clean. Two of the people died. The ""superbug"" at issue -- carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, or CRE -- is the latest and most difficult to treat in a series of superbugs that includes MRSA and VRE.  Such bacteria are the Frankensteinian result of our misusing antibiotics over many decades, and beating them back will require the kind of surveillance and coordination that might have prevented them in the first place. We might not have much more than dumb luck to thank for the fact that the CRE superbug hasn't spread to most American hospitals yet. Duodenoscopes are among the least likely routes for spreading CRE, given that the pathogen can contaminate most any surface in a hospital room, but our lack of coordinated attention to this detail, among others, is infecting people nonetheless. The FDA first alerted doctors using the scopes back in 2009 that they could be transmitting bacteria, even after proper cleaning, Reuters reported.   But -- remarkably -- this agency, responsible for regulating all medical devices, has yet to take any action, though its menu of options is broad, ranging from taking the scopes off the market to demanding the manufacturers improve their designs or upgrade their recommended cleaning protocols. Apparently detecting an underwhelming sense of urgency at the FDA, Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who sits on the House oversight committee, asked his committee to launch hearings into whether the agency is doing all it can to investigate and implement all potential solutions. Lieu appeared prescient later Monday when a top FDA official told the Los Angeles Times the agency hadn't given due scrutiny to the cleaning protocols when it approved the scopes. UCLA is only the the most recent of several American medical centers, including hospitals in Seattle and Chicago, where CRE has hitched a ride on the duodenoscope, designed to treat blockages and other conditions of secretory ducts leading into the first segment of the intestines, called the duodenum. The Seattle outbreak occurred from 2012 to 2014, but FDA's warning to medical providers and hospitals last week, in the wake of the UCLA infections, revealed that the agency didn't know what should be done to prevent the infections beyond ""meticulously cleaning"" prior to the standard disinfection procedure. The FDA didn't even alert providers to the fact that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is about to release a new guideline that includes the Seattle protocol. Reuters broke that news on Friday. But the CDC can only recommend, not enforce guidelines. It will take the FDA's action to ensure that the pricey approach adopted in Seattle is applied universally. CDC, FDA, hospitals and all medical providers must engage in broader and more coordinated information sharing, and then act quickly and decisively with strategies to contain the bacteria and treat victims. The scopes may have been a factor in the unwitting spread of various bacteria between patients for years, but it's a CRE diagnosis that will put all hands on deck and prompt a thorough investigation to get to the source.  Why? CRE kills up to 40% of infected individuals once it spreads into the bloodstream. Individual hospitals affected by scope-related CRE outbreaks have out of necessity rolled out creative decontamination protocols of their own that include exposing the scopes to a toxic gas and culturing the scopes and setting them aside for days while any bacteria grow. Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta even throws in a little extra elbow grease by giving the scope's delicate parts a thorough toothbrushing. Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, which suffered 11 patient deaths after contaminated duodenoscopes introduced bacteria into its patients, hasn't seen any further cases since implementing its surveillance culture protocol, which has cost the hospital $1 million in additional scopes, USA Today reported. Hospitals are generating their protocols without clear guidance from the FDA, which oddly chose the venue of the LA Times interview Monday to cast doubt on UCLA's new approach of using ethylene oxide gas to kill off any CRE still on used scopes. An FDA official  wondered aloud if some of the toxic gas could linger on the scopes and harm patients, and UCLA immediately replied that the scopes are set aside long enough for the gas to dissipate. None of these exchanges inspires confidence. The agency's back-seat driver approach is clearly a source of great frustration when infectious disease specialists and quality consultants are both asking for stricter regulation. In fairness, the FDA is grossly understaffed for the job of regulating medical devices. The act granting the agency its authority to collect user fees from device companies to fund its review activities enables the agency to employ just 200 workers for all aspects of its process, from premarket approval to post-market surveillance. What's more, hospitals and clinics generate a tsunami of medical records that contain information about how various medical devices are working on a daily basis, but researchers and the FDA have inordinate trouble making much of it useful, because the precise devices aren't clearly identified. Fortunately the agency is working on rolling out unique device identification codes that will make these records into actionable data. Taxpayers need our government to levy smart fees that are directed to fund the functions of key agencies like the FDA and the CDC, which we rely on to make sure medical devices are as safe as possible when they're introduced and to keep track of any problems on a continuous basis. Instead, the Affordable Care Act included a 2.3% across-the-board device tax that's not about improving medical devices but rather is decreasing economic activity in this sector. Tapping the brakes on the medical device industry isn't a good idea when we're relying on its innovations to fix problems like the duodenoscope design. On the other hand, President Obama's 2016 budget includes $264 million for the Antibiotic Resistance Solutions Initiative, a project that will engage the CDC in coordinating regional labs and rapid data-sharing to detect superbugs and learn their characteristics. This is crucial to stop the community spread of CRE; in North Carolina, where three patients contracted CRE inside one hospital, 15 people actually brought CRE with them into the hospital rather than getting it there. The program would also spread best practices for antibiotic usage among all levels of medical facilities, so that CRE doesn't become endemic and thus a routine cause of death in our hospitals. It's a great next step. Whatever wrangling Republicans have planned for the White House budget shouldn't include excising such an essential public health measure, especially in the wake of what we're seeing play out at UCLA.","Ford Vox: Lethal CRE ""superbug"" outbreak needs coordinated effort by hospitals, government to beat it back .

"(CNN)Assyrians in northeastern Syria villages awoke Tuesday to ISIS militants at their doors, with the Islamist extremists abducting scores from the Christian group and forcing hundreds more to run for their lives, an advocate said. The ISIS fighters burst past a few men guarding the village of Tal Shamiram at about 4 a.m. (9 p.m. ET Monday) and abducted children, women and the elderly, said Usama Edward, founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. Talking to CNN from Stockholm, Sweden, Edward said that between 70 and 100 people were kidnapped in that village and others in the same cluster near Tal Tamer. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that ISIS had abducted 90 Assyrians. ""Reliable sources"" told the London-based monitoring organization that they'd overheard ISIS militants talking on wireless devices about having detained ""56 crusaders"" in Tal Shamiram alone. In the village of Ghibsh, ISIS executed two citizens for ""dealing with the Kurds,"" the Syrian Observatory reported. Syrian Kurdish fighters -- who are part of the People's Protection Units, or YPGs, and affiliated with Kurdish fighters out of Iraq -- are among those battling the Islamist extremist group. About 700 Assyrian families managed to escape the onslaught, with 600 taking up refuge in St. Mary's Cathedral in al-Hasakah, Syria, Edward said. The Assyrians lack food, water, blankets and other necessities after years of being in the middle of a civil war. ""They are facing a possible massacre by the (Syrian) regime and by ISIS,"" Edward said. ""Everyone is fighting everyone else. They are surrounded."" ISIS has attacked numerous minority groups during a bloody campaign to create a vast caliphate across Syria and Iraq under its extreme version of Sharia law. That includes Assyrians in Qaraqosh, a historic town of 50,000 people in northern Iraq about 20 miles southeast of Mosul that was overrun this summer. Many Mosul residents had fled to Qaraqosh after the Islamist extremists took over that city, Iraq's second-largest. At the time, ISIS issued an ultimatum to Christians living there: Convert to Islam, pay a fine or face ""death by sword."" The latest reported abduction occurred about 160 miles (255 kilometers) east of Qaraqosh. Edward, from the Assyrian Human Rights Network, said members of his group and other Syrian Christians have been ""left all alone"" by Syria's government and the world. Kurdish fighters may launch an operation to rescue those abducted, ""but it very dangerous (and) everyone could get killed."" ""This is like a miracle that they have survived this long,"" he said of his fellow Assyrians. ""How can these people stay alive? They are trying to defend their homes."" ISIS isn't the only threat to Assyrians, given all the violence around them in the places they call home. Nearly four years in, Syria's civil war is still raging -- with a U.N. official in January reporting some 220,000 people killed and 7.6 million displaced. There are atrocities in that war that aren't being blamed on ISIS, including a Human Rights Watch report out Tuesday blaming Syria's government for ""hundreds of new discriminate attacks"" in the past year, including the use of barrel bombs. Iraq isn't exactly a picture of stability, either. The militant group isn't thought to have penetrated Baghdad. That city has seen more than its fair share of attacks in recent months -- the latest being bombings, just a few minutes apart, that killed 21 women, children and men on Tuesday, according to officials. Still, it's ISIS that has gotten the most traction internationally for its success and tactics. The militant group has ruthlessly gone after groups that don't give into its subscribe to ISIS' take on Islam. Some of those affected are Christians, but many others are Muslims who don't accept its radical ideology. By last year, ISIS had taken over swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria and later inspired terror attacks in Paris and the Danish capital of Copenhagen. But it's received pushback recently, with a strong showing from Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and the retooling of Iraq's once maligned military. There also have been hundreds of U.S.-led airstrikes in Iraq and Syria targeting ISIS, which the U.S. government also refers to as ISIL. ""This is a difficult mission and it will remain difficult for some time,"" President Barack Obama said this month. ""(But) our coalition is on the offensive, ISIL is on the defensive, and ISIL is going to lose."" The threat is anything but over. In some places, the group is holding and even gaining ground. The biggest test, for all sides, will likely come over Mosul. Up to 25,000 Iraqi troops could begin their push to retake that northern Iraqi city as soon as April, a U.S. official has said. A U.S. Defense Department official said Washington is supplying the Iraqis with 10,000 M16 rifles, 10,000 M68 close combat optical scopes, some 23,000 ammunition magazines and ""thousands"" of additional helmets and Kevlar vests in preparation for the Mosul assault. This shipment is in addition to 250 mine-resistant vehicles sent over in January, and some 1,800 Hellfire missiles shipped over in 2014 and this year.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)An American missionary in Nigeria has been kidnapped in what authorities call a ""purely criminal"" act. Kogi state Police Commissioner Adeyemi Ogunjemilusi says five men kidnapped the woman from her workplace and are demanding a ransom of 60 million Naira ($301,500). The Free Methodist Church has identified the woman as the Rev. Phyllis Sortor, a missionary based at the Hope Academy compound in Kogi state. Kogi state is located away from the areas where Boko Haram operates, making it likely that the kidnapping is not related to terrorism. But there is also the possibility that an offshoot group could have kidnapped Sortor, or that she might be sold to another group. Police have not said if they suspect a certain group or band of criminals. Sortor was kidnapped on Monday, Ogunjemilusi said. The U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and the FBI have been notified of the incident, the Free Methodist Church said. Sortor runs a nongovernmental organization that educates nomadic Fulani children, the police commissioner said. According to her biography on the church's website, Sortor is the financial administrator of Hope Academy. ""A special friendship with a clan of nomadic Fulani has given Phyllis the opportunity to open additional schools for Fulani children and their parents,"" the website says. The commissioner said five men scaled the wall of the school where Sortor's office is and ""whisked her away,"" jumping back over the wall and fleeing to the nearby mountains. Two of the men were masked, and they fired shots into the air to scare people away during the kidnapping, Ogunjemilusi said.

"(CNN)A big hole in the ground discovered near a venue for the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto has stumped authorities looking into it. The mysterious tunnel measured more than 6 feet in height, nearly 3 feet in width and about 33 feet in length, Toronto Police Deputy Chief Mark Saunders told reporters Tuesday. Plywood walls were reinforced with wooden supports. The tunnel was 10 feet underground, with a ladder leading down to the chamber. A rosary with a Remembrance Day poppy hung from a nail on the wall. Remembrance Day honors Canadian veterans who died in combat. ""What does that tell you?"" a reporter asked the deputy chief. ""That tells me that this was nailed inside the tunnel on the wall,"" Saunders deadpanned as the room erupted with laughter. Nothing so far suggests criminal activity or terrorist intent, Saunders said. ""I wasn't overly concerned that 'Oh my goodness this is going to be something horrific,' "" said Saunders, a 31-year veteran overseeing security of the world's third largest international multi-sport games. ""We've got steps and measures in place"" to deal with these kinds of threats, said Saunders. ""If someone is going to be nefarious in this type of way, we'll be on top of it."" The discovery of the tunnel -- which was made by a conservation officer last month, but disclosed Tuesday -- comes amid heightened concerns about terrorism in Canada and beyond. In October, a soldier was shot and killed as he stood guard at Canada's National War Memorial in Ottawa. Officials said the gunman had connections to jihadists who shared a radical Islamist ideology. Two days before the Ottawa attack, another Canadian soldier in Quebec was run over and killed by man whom the Royal Canadian Mounted Police described as ""radicalized."" Saunders said the tunnel found about 82 feet west of a fence that separated a densely wooded area from tennis courts at Rexall Centre, a tennis and entertainment complex on the grounds of York University. ""There is nothing right now that suggest that this is criminal,"" he said. ""We're trying to find and establish right now who built it, why they built it and what were their intentions."" ""There is no criminal offense for digging a hole."" Authorities are seeking information from the public about any suspicious activity in the area. The tunnel was equipped with electricity supplied by a generator, a sump pump to remove water and a pulley system to remove dirt, Saunders said. It likely took more than one person to dig it out by hand. Ice that formed at the end of a hose attached to the sump pump indicates that the tunnel may have been used this winter. ""This was built with a considerable amount of sophistication,"" Saunders said. ""The individuals responsible for building it clearly had some expertise in structural integrity."" Police also found a gas can, food and beverage containers, work gloves, a wheel barrow and moisture-resistant light bulbs in the tunnel, which has been filled in. Its entrance was concealed by dirt over a wood lid. ""We don't know whether someone is building one somewhere else,"" Saunders said. ""I'm open to anything right now."" The Pan American Games, which take place from July 10 to July 26, involve nearly 7,000 athletes from Latin America, South America, the Caribbean and North America. It is the third largest international sports competition after the Olympic Summer Games and the Asian Games.

"(CNN)A man who Tennessee authorities tried to have indicted in connection with the kidnapping and killing of a nursing student has committed suicide, his attorney told CNN on Tuesday. The investigation into the killing of Holly Bobo has not been smooth. The suicide of Shayne Austin is the latest twist. Bobo, a 20-year-old nursing student, disappeared in April 2011. Her remains were not found until last September, in Decatur County. Shayne Austin was never indicted, but was in prosecutors' sights and was threatened with possible charges. Two other men -- Jason Wayne Autry and Zachary Adams -- are charged with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder in Bobo's killing. Both have pleaded not guilty. Austin's role in the case, according to attorney Luke Evans, was to cooperate with authorities in exchange for immunity from prosecution. Days after Austin was granted immunity in March 2014, the state tried to void the deal and tried at least twice to indict Austin, his attorney said. As a result, Evans filed a civil breach of contract suit against the state, asking the court to enforce the immunity deal as well as a restraining order to prevent the state from further attempts at indictment.  That case is pending in circuit court, Evans said. The state said it revoked the immunity agreement because Austin was not being truthful or fully cooperative, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. Evans told the affiliate that his client always maintained that he had nothing to do with Bobo's death. Bobo's brother told authorities he saw a man in camouflage leading Bobo away from their home in Darden in April 2011. Volunteers from at least five counties searched for the student, and donors raised more than $450,000 in reward money to help find whoever was responsible. Investigators ruled out early reports that Bobo had been dragged away from her home, but they didn't believe she left of her own free will, either. ""We feel she was in fear of her life so she was compliant with his demands,"" a Tennessee Bureau of Investigations (TBI) special agent said at the time. Bobo was on her way to school when she disappeared. Suspects Autry and Adams were indicted in March 2014. Information from ""several witnesses"" led to charges against them, the head of the TBI said then. Investigators ""believe there are more people with information and possible involvement,"" the TBI said. Months later, in December, the TBI announced that it was withdrawing from the investigation. In a statement, the agency said that the district attorney accused the TBI of misconduct, along with other law enforcement agencies. At the district attorney's request, the TBI stopped its investigation. But shortly afterward, the TBI resumed its work on the Bobo case after the district attorney took himself off the case and appointed a special prosecutor to handle it, according to The Jackson Sun. CNN's Holly Yan contributed to this report.","Shayne Austin was granted immunity in the death investigation of Holly Bobo .

"(The Hollywood Reporter)Now in its third season, ""House of Cards"" has one of those problems that soap operas bump up against all the time: story fatigue. You can only ask your audience to buy into the political shenanigans of Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey) and wife Claire (Robin Wright) for so long, given the Gumbyesque contortions that the series uses to entertain. That manipulation often comes at the expense of believability — because ""House of Cards"" refuses to restrain itself and often goes, in a parlance that Francis would approve of, balls out in an effort to make the Underwoods ridiculously ruthless and the series ridiculously entertaining. Unfortunately, after holding out against the cruel intrusion of reality, at some point in season two of ""House of Cards,"" ridiculous was the key word for pretty much everything in it. ""Don't Be Gentle:"" 10 Ruthless Quotes From 'House of Cards' Season 3 . That wouldn't be much of a problem if ""House of Cards"" was, like a true soap opera, keenly aware of its reputation (like, say, ""Scandal""). Meaning, if ""House of Cards"" really believed that its ridiculousness was a wink-wink at the audience, its diversions from believability wouldn't be so troubling. Instead, ""House of Cards"" has been the poster series for both the popularity of Netflix as a streaming service with strong original content and as a big player for the service at awards shows. It takes itself very seriously. In that role, ""House of Cards"" is often touted as a prestige drama a la ""Breaking Bad,"" ""Mad Men"" and ""The Americans,"" among others. But if season two proved anything, with its collapsing parade of paper tigers standing up to Frank's quest for ultimate power, it's that the series is far more entertaining than it is great. Power wielded by a ruthless married couple as they sack Washington D.C. is a pretty fun thing to behold, soapy as it is racing toward the assured victory, the stakes-free gamble. There just wasn't much gravitas in the midst of it as the bubbles got in your eyes. I'm certainly fine with ""House of Cards"" being that show. If you buy into it as a sweet, sparkling wine to be guzzled without care as you binge your way through it, that seems very apropos of what you're getting. The danger is confusing it with actual Champagne. It's not that. Awards shows are still making this qualitatively dubious connection (as they've done to an even worse degree with another soap opera, ""Downton Abbey""). I worry that the creative forces behind ""House of Cards"" will blindly accept the accolades and not address the more glaring issues critics (and fans) began harping on in season two. Early episodes of the third season of ""House of Cards"" indicate a change of direction might be afoot, though plenty of worry remains that this will be only temporary and the Underwoods will continue to fool and rule the world with the ease of master puppeteers as the season goes forward. But at least in the early going, creator Beau Willimon and the many executive producers with a hand in this series seem to agree that maybe the Underwoods, now known as the President and First Lady of the United States, need to hit some road blocks that they can't immediately get around. 'House of Cards' Showrunner on Leak: Fans Haven't ""Figured Everything Out"" A series like ""House of Cards"" has a lot of twists to be spoiled, but there's no point in doing that here — a good soap keeps the twists coming and that's what the audience wants. But at least in dealing with the basic moving parts of the series, it's safe to say being President and First Lady isn't as easy or as satisfying as Frank and Claire expected. Both want more. Frank wants, naturally, to avoid being a placeholder president and focus on getting reelected. But everything he's tried in office — and most of it has been ambitious — has eroded his approval ratings. Times are tough. He's not being very effective and Democrats are dubious as to whether he's the face of the future, especially as the Republicans are lining up in solidarity behind Hector Mendoza (Benito Martinez). For her part, Claire — in a storyline that harkens back to the Clinton years — isn't satisfied just being First Lady. She wants to lead and do something. She wants to be political because that's what's in her blood. And in a lovely reflection of their odd relationship, Claire has no qualms in telling Frank that if he's going down in the next election, she plans to ascend at the same time. Power and politics — these two understand it, even if it means telling the other that you'll carry on if they fall. After all the cream-puff politicians and supposedly brilliant strategists that the Underwoods have fooled all too easily in the first two seasons, a little payback and a little failure plays well for ""House of Cards."" However, the worry remains that now that they have the ultimate seats in politics, Frank and Claire won't go down without swinging and, in true ""House of Cards"" fashion, will hit and destroy everything they swing at. If that unbelievable sense of dramatic stakes returns, ""House of Cards"" will find itself in a scandal about how good it really is. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter.

"(CNN)Suicide bombers targeting a bus station in Kano, Nigeria, killed 10 people and left several injured Tuesday, according to the city's police chief, just hours after a similar attack in Yobe state killed 17 people. Two men detonated the explosives concealed under their clothes as soon as they got off the bus at Kano Line motor park Tuesday afternoon, Police Commissioner Ibrahim Idris said. The busy station is located in the city center of Kano. Idris said the two men took the bus from the town of Wuddil, 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) from Kano. ""The bus station was their target, and taking a bus from outside the city gave them easy access into the bus station,""  Idris said, explaining that the men ""would have undergone screening before getting inside if they had come by any other means."" The attack occurred at 3 p.m. local time, just hours after another suicide attack left 17 people dead, in addition to the bomber, and 27 people injured at a bus station in Potiskum, about 200 miles away in Yobe state. The Potiskum attack occurred at Tashar Dan-Borno motor park on the outskirts of town. A man pretending to be a passenger detonated the explosives as he boarded the bus, which was being loaded and prepared for departure, according to witnesses. An official at the Potiskum motor park said 12 passengers were inside the bus when the bomber, who ""looked to be in a hurry"" came and dropped his luggage in the baggage compartment. The man ""made to enter the bus, but before he could be restrained for routine screening there was an explosion which killed all 12 people inside the bus and the bomber,"" the motor park official said. A paramedic at Potiskum General Hospital, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said four people who were transported from the scene died later. Resident Ahmad Maina, who was at the scene shortly after the blast, said the bus was engulfed in flames as firefighters struggled to keep it from spreading to other vehicles. Although no one has claimed responsibility for either of the attacks, Boko Haram has been behind dozens of suicide and other bombings‎ in northern Nigeria. Potiskum, the commercial hub of Yobe state, has been hit repeatedly in recent months by bombings blamed on the extremist Islamist group. On Sunday, a 7-year-old girl blew herself up outside a cell phone market in the town, killing seven people and injuring 11. Last month, two suicide bombers killed six people and injured 37 at the same market. Likewise in Kano, northern Nigeria's most populous city, suicide bombings in the past year have targeted schools, gas stations and a market. Boko Haram's stated goal is to bring an extreme version of Sharia law to the masses. Along with suicide bombings they have attacked churches and mosques, raided once-peaceful villages and kidnapped people young and old, most infamously more than 200 girls taken last April from a school in Chibok. More than 150,000 people have fled into neighboring countries as a result of the violence, according to the United Nations refugee agency, and Boko Haram has spread its reign of terror into villages and towns beyond Nigeria's borders. Currently, thousands of Chadian troops are in Cameroon helping that nation's military root out Boko Haram fighters.

"(CNN)New Zealand has become the latest nation to join the international coalition fighting ISIS, with Prime Minister John Key telling lawmakers Tuesday 143 military personnel were deploying to Iraq in a non-combat role. In a two-year mission likely to start in May, New Zealand personnel will  train Iraq security forces at the Taji Military Complex north of Baghdad, Key said. He said soldiers would provide protection for the training force. Key said ISIS -- also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) --  posed a threat to stability in regions beyond the Middle East and New Zealand had ""an obligation"" to help support the rule of law internationally. ""New Zealand is a country that stands up for its values. We stand up for what is right,"" he told parliament. ""We do not shy away from taking our share of the burden when the international rules based system is threatened as it is today."" Key said attacks in Ottawa, Sydney and Paris had underscored the risk of complacency. ""To those who argue that we should not take action because it raises the threat, I say this 'the risk associated with ISIL becoming stronger and more widespread far outweighs this.'"" In a statement, Key referred to New Zealanders as ""prolific travelers"" who were not immune from the risk posed by ISIS. ""ISIL's brutality has only worsened and its outrageous actions have united an international coalition of around 62 countries to fight and degrade the group,"" he said. Who's doing what in the coalition battle against ISIS? Opposition leaders were quick to condemn the decision, which they said should have been debated and voted on in parliament. Labour leader Andrew Little said his party was opposed to sending troops to Iraq and that it was unlikely they would remain behind the front line. ""The Prime Minister says they will be behind the wire but we know they will not be. They cannot stick there, they cannot stay there, that is not all they will do. They will not just be behind the wire; they will be exposed to the much wider conflict; it will not be just the soldiers we send to the Iraq, it will be Kiwis traveling around the world,"" Little said. Green Party Leader Russel Norman said Key was ""dragging New Zealand into someone else's war without a mandate"" and was making the country and its citizens unnecessary targets for ISIS. New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said Key had made a ""giant turnaround"" since ruling out  a troop deployment. ""Nothing has changed in Iraq, except 'his club' persuaded Mr Key to commit our troops,"" Peters said in a statement. 'Not taken lightly' Key said the government had carefully considered New Zealand's contribution to the coalition. ""A training mission like this is not without danger and this is not a decision we have taken lightly,"" he said. ""I have required assurances that our men and women will be as safe as they can practicably be in Taji. The deployment came at the request of the Iraqi government and was likely to be a joint training mission with neighboring Australia, Key said. New Zealand's cabinet would review the deployment after nine months, he added. The United States is leading the coalition to fight ISIS from the sky over Iraq and Syria. The militant group has declared an Islamic caliphate in the area and demanded that all Muslims pledge allegiance to its leader -- Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Richard Jackson from the National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at New Zealand's University of Otago said New Zealand's commitment to the coalition would likely be dangerous for its citizens in the Middle East region. ""There is definitely a risk in joining the international effort and that risk is first of all that New Zealand personnel in the region will become a more identifiable target,"" he told CNN. ""The secondary risk is that New Zealand involvement in the international effort will radicalize people in New Zealand and or Australia. I think that's a very small risk because I don't think there are many potential extremists in New Zealand."" ISIS did not directly pose a threat to NZ domestically, Jackson said. ""The only influence they have is an indirect one. If they start showing pictures of civilians killed by Western bombing that might involve someone living in Auckland or Canberra or elsewhere who might decide off their own bat to commit an act of violence."" Jackson warned that the conflict would likely escalate and said that New Zealand had no clear exit strategy. ""Involvement just keeps going forward rather than backwards -- it will be very hard to disentangle,"" he said. ""It seems to me like a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to the admittedly horrific propaganda videos produced by ISIS. The other problem is that ISIS has a plan and that plan is to suck in Western troops so that they can fight them on the ground. It suits their agenda."" Political arguments . Robert Ayson, Professor of Strategic Studies at Victoria University in Wellington said that had John Key's government opted to allow parliament to vote on the deployment it likely would have failed to win majority support. ""It's been clear for some time that the government was intending to make a military contribution,"" he said.""It's become an issue of considerable division between the government on the one hand and the opposition on the other."" New Zealand's successful pitch to join the United Nations Security Council involved presenting itself as a country that had an independent foreign policy, and may have been a factor in the delaying the commitment, Ayson said. The delay had also  provided opposition parties with plenty of opportunity to poke holes in the government's argument for joining the coalition, he said. Comments Key made in January about involvement  being ""the price of the club,"" had fed into the opposition Labour Party's argument that being independent meant having ""the ability to say no from time to time,"" Ayson said. ""It's quite possible that the government felt that it could get wider public support if this was just a training mission, but it hasn't been able to convince the opposition,"" Ayson said. ""For the opposition this is like 'let's not repeat 2003 [the Iraq invasion].' This is of course not like 2003, this is not an unrequested invasion,"" he said. ""Given that there are 62 countries in the coalition it's not like Iraq in 2003. It's almost as if opposition parties in NZ are wanting to avoid the last war."" The United States said it welcomed New Zealand's contribution. ""As one of our partners in the coalition, New Zealand has already provided substantial humanitarian assistance to Iraq and Syria. ""We value the contributions and efforts of all partners in the mission as we work together on a multifaceted and long-term strategy to degrade and defeat ISIL,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.","Prime Minister John Key confirms New Zealand troops to be deployed to Iraq .

"(CNN)Marie Holmes was watching cartoons with her kids when she won the Powerball jackpot. But at the time, the 26-year-old single mom in North Carolina had no idea she was about to be $127 million richer. It wasn't until the next day, when she saw a friend post online about the lottery numbers, that she realized she had the winning ticket. Even then, she didn't believe it until she double-checked the numbers with her mother. Then, she screamed. ""I scared my kids because I was jumping up and down in the house,"" she said, beaming on Monday after North Carolina lottery officials handed over a giant check with her name on it as confetti rained down from the ceiling. Their startled reaction was just the first of many ways Holmes said her children -- ages 7, 4, 3 and nine months -- are going to see their lives change because of the prize, she said. ""This is going to make a huge difference for them,"" she said. ""They're going to be able to go to school, not have to worry about paying for it. They're going to be able to live a comfortable life and not worry about struggling."" Holmes is from the coastal town of Shallotte, North Carolina.  The winning ticket, Holmes said, was in a $15 batch her mom picked up for her at a convenience store on the way to church. The other two winning tickets of this month's Powerball jackpot were purchased in Texas and Puerto Rico, and the three winners split a jackpot listed by lottery officials at $564 million. Split three ways, that comes to $188 million each, if the winners took the payout over time. A lump-sum payment is smaller, but still, $127 million is no small change. Even after taxes. Holmes' win is the largest in North Carolina's history, officials said. Holmes told CNN affiliate WECT last week that she thought she was going to have a heart attack when she found out she'd won. ""I don't know if I want to cry, smile, what, I'm just grateful for this moment. I'm thankful that I can bless my kids with something that I didn't have,"" she said. But she was more measured on Monday. ""I'm not sure how I feel right now,"" she said. ""I don't believe it yet."" Holmes has supported her children in the past with jobs at Walmart, Food Lion supermarket, KFC, McDonald's and Subway, lottery officials said. She's been living with seven of her family members in one home. Now she's hoping to get each of them their own place to live. Since the day earlier this month when she realized she'd won, Holmes said her life has already changed. She was sandwiched between a lawyer and financial adviser as she accepted her winnings Monday. Security, she said, now has to accompany her whenever she goes outside -- something she's still adjusting to. She told reporters Monday she wants to keep her kids out of the spotlight to make sure they're safe. She said she's still consulting with advisers about how to spend the money, which she's accepted in the $127 million lump-sum payment (totaling $87.9 million after taxes).. For now, she said she plans to donate to churches and cerebral palsy charities. She's also hoping to travel, possibly leaving the United States for the first time to visit Paris. And she wants to go back to school. The prize, she said, means everything to her as a mother. ""Anything my kids ask for, I can actually get it for them, and I don't have to tell them, 'no,'"" she said. Asked by a reporter if she would still tell them no anyway for good reasons, Holmes smiled and didn't hesitate. ""Yes,"" she said.","""I was jumping up and down in the house,"" Powerball winner Marie Holmes says .

"Stephenville, Texas (CNN)No one disputes that Eddie Ray Routh shot and killed Chris Kyle and another man. But his attorneys wanted to convince a jury he wasn't sane when he did so. It took Texas jurors less than three hours to deliver their verdict: They weren't buying it. The jury found Routh guilty of capital murder in the deaths of Kyle, the author of the best-seller ""American Sniper,"" and Kyle's friend Chad Littlefield. Judge Jason Cashon immediately sentenced Routh to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the capital murder conviction. ""We've waited two years for God to get justice for us on behalf of our son and, as always, God has proved to be faithful,"" said Judy Littlefield, the victim's mother. ""We're so thrilled that we have the verdict that we have tonight."" Jurors deliberating the case had three choices: guilty, not guilty or not guilty by reason of insanity. No one disputed that Routh shot and killed the men. But defense attorneys said Routh was insane. Prosecutors dismissed that assertion outright. ""Ladies and gentleman, that is not insanity. That is just cold, calculated capital murder. He is guilty of capital murder. He is not in any way insane,"" said prosecutor Jane Starnes during closing arguments. Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. She said Routh knew the difference between right and wrong. Suspect's confession played at trial . Starnes urged jurors to ""follow the law,"" allowing it to guide them ""to the true and correct verdict."" For its part, the defense pointed to Routh's long history of mental illness. ""He killed those men because he had a delusion. He believed in his mind that they were going to kill him,"" attorney J. Warren St. John said. Lawyer: Kyle called Routh 'straight-up nuts' in text . Routh's trial comes in the wake of the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history, with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq. ""American Sniper,"" directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, is already the highest-grossing war movie. Kyle's autobiography by the same name spent weeks on best-seller lists. He had already risen to fame through his book when he died and had been involved in charitable work to help former troops suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. On February 2, 2013, Kyle and his friend, Littlefield, took Routh to a firing range as a kind of therapy. The range is a small, remote part of the sprawling 11,000-acre Rough Creek Lodge, and the men were isolated. A hunting guide found Kyle, 38, and Littlefield, 35, motionless and called 911. The men were dead when officers arrived. What's never been clear is why Routh killed Kyle and Littlefield, but there have been a series of confusing and incoherent explanations for Routh's motives. Kyle apparently sensed tension as he and Littlefield drove the former U.S. Marine to the gun range. Kyle secretly texted Littlefield, sitting next to him in a pickup, to say Routh was ""straight-up nuts."" Yet Routh has never revealed a clear reason in the fatal shootings. Kyle was shot four times in the back and once in the face. Littlefield was shot five times in the back. Gene Cole worked as an officer in the Erath County Jail, where Routh has been held since his arrest in the killings. Cole testified he heard Routh talk about the shootings four months after they took place. ""I heard Mr. Routh say, 'I shot them because they wouldn't talk to me. I was just riding in the back seat of the truck and nobody would talk to me. They were just taking me to the range so I shot them. I feel bad about it, but they wouldn't talk to me. I'm sure they've forgiven me,' "" Cole said. In May 2013, Routh provided another explanation in a phone interview he did from jail with New Yorker magazine writer Nicholas Schmidle. Portions of the recorded conversation were played for the jury. Routh described being annoyed with Kyle and Littlefield as they made the 90-minute drive from his home to the countryside gun range. Routh didn't trust the Navy SEAL and his friend after their first meeting, he told Schmidle. But his rationale was perplexing. Routh complained about the smell of the air that day. ""It smelled like sh--,"" Routh said. ""It smelled like sweet cologne. I guess it was love and hate, you know. I was smelling love and hate. They were giving me some love and hate."" CNN's Ed Lavandera and Jason Morris reported from Stephenville, Texas. Ed Payne and Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta.","The jury reaches a verdict in capital murder case in a few hours .

"(CNN)It's not hard to get into Raqqa. The problem, one prominent activist tells CNN, is getting out. Abu Ibrahim al-Raqqawi's voice is calm and measured as he describes life inside the city ISIS claims as the capital of its so-called caliphate. But the horrors he details are harrowing. Airstrikes. Executions. Forced blood donations and marriages to ISIS fighters. Al-Raqqawi isn't his real name. It's the identity the former medical student who helped found an activist group called ""Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently"" uses to speak out. ISIS fighters have already tortured and executed one member of the group, he says, and they've made it clear they want the others involved dead. Still, al-Raqqawi tells CNN's Brooke Baldwin that won't stop him from sharing what he sees. ""I lost my life ... I don't have school. I don't have a future. I don't have anything, but I didn't want that for me or for my city,"" he says. ""It's the situation forcing me to do this. I don't want to be famous. I don't want everybody to know who I am or what I'm doing. It's just for my city and for my family and for the innocent civilians. ... We are trying our best. We are trying to save our city."" Here's a look at some of the things al-Raqqawi has told CNN he and others from the activist group have seen in Raqqa. CNN hasn't independently confirmed his claims, but his account provides a rare glimpse into the dramatic transformation of a city once known as one of Syria's most liberal. In two months at least 40 people have been executed in Raqqa, al-Raqqawi says, for charges including being a fighter for the Free Syrian Army, being gay or killing others. Activists, he says, are also targeted. ""If you are an activist...inside the city of Raqqa, it will take you to death,"" he says. In Raqqa, al-Raqqawi says, a day might start out with a trip to court over a home robbery, and end up with a forced blood donation. ""If you have anything in the Islamic court, they say, 'Go to the hospital and donate your blood and bring me the receipt, and if you don't have it, I can't help you,"" he says. ""They say to you, 'We can't help you until you go to the hospital. There (are) a lot of airstrikes, a lot of injured ISIS fighters.'"" For women, al-Raqqawi says, the city is ""like a big prison."" They are not allowed to leave the city if they are younger than 45 years old. And he says his activist group has documented more than 270 cases of girls forced to marry ISIS fighters. ""ISIS fighters are really sex-mad. ... Some of them have two and three wives, and even with that they are trying to find slaves from Yazidi girls,"" he says. An effort to repaint buildings in bright colors isn't what you'd expect to see in a square known as the site of executions, beheadings and crucifixions. But al-Raqqawi says that's just what happened in Raqqa several weeks ago. The change is particularly notable, he says, because when ISIS first came to the city they painted buildings black. Now, al-Raqqawi says the fresh coats of pink, white, gold and green paint could be a sign that ISIS is trying to make buildings less of a target for coalition airstrikes. ""There is a big wall between the civilians and foreign fighters. It's like two different lives inside the city of Raqqa,"" al-Raqqawi says. ""Yes it's heaven for some of these foreign fighters, because they give them a lot of money. They give them the fancy houses. They give them the fancy cars."" But for some, it's not the paradise they imagined, al-Raqqawi says. Rumors swirl, he says, about foreign fighters being killed after trying to defect. ""ISIS takes their passports and if anyone tries defection from this, they will kill them immediately,"" he says. ""The problem, it's not how to go inside the city of Raqqa. The problem is how to get out.""","""We are trying to save our city,"" an activist tells CNN's Brooke Baldwin .

"(CNN)It was never a ratings smash, but the impact of ""Parks and Recreation"" can't be understated. After a somewhat underwhelming first season, critics started to sing the praises of the Amy Poehler series in season 2, noting its portrayal of an intelligent, driven woman in charge and one of the most talented comedic casts on television. (After all, it gave us Chris Pratt.) The show slowly gained a loyal fan base, especially once it was available for binge-watching online. Now, the names Leslie Knope and Ron Swanson are just as beloved as Homer J. Simpson or Cosmo Kramer to die-hard fans. Plus, what other show has had cameos by both Vice President Joe Biden and first lady Michelle Obama, along with an impressive number of senators and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright? The show came to a conclusion Tuesday night, and it also marked the end of an era at NBC, which is losing the last of its Thursday night comedies. There are so many things to love about ""Parks and Recreation,"" and we tried to narrow them down to as few as we could: . -- Treat Yo Self Day: The holiday so brilliant, it's surprising it hasn't caught on as much as ""Seinfeld's"" Festivus. Give it time, though. It is, after all, ""the best day of the year!"" -- Ron's words of wisdom: For many, the brand of unapologetic maleness of Ron Swanson has been inspirational, a spot-on, if loving, parody of libertarianism. Nick Offerman's portrayal is as Emmy-worthy as they come, and it's a crime he was never recognized as much as he ought to be. -- Perd Hapley: We don't get much of him, but Jay Jackson's portrayal of the alarmingly clueless news anchor (Jackson is a real-life CNN iReporter)  is gut-bustingly funny. -- Lil Sebastian: The town of Pawnee's love for this little pony is inexplicable, and yet, that makes it one of the funnier storylines this show ever had, especially the memorial service for him. -- Andy and April: Before he was a guardian of the galaxy, Chris Pratt had us rolling in the aisles as Andy Dwyer (or Burt Macklin or Johnny Karate). When he met the woman of his dreams, the extremely antisocial April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza), it was true love, and the couple was married quickly. -- Chris Traeger: We really miss Rob Lowe's portrayal of the insanely optimistic Chris, but we've always got reruns. -- Galentine's Day: Leslie's idea to celebrate female friends has caught on in real life. -- Tom and Jean Ralphio: These two were made for each other, the swaggiest man in Pawnee and, well, Jean-Ralphio, who defies explanation but never fails to entertain. -- Patton Oswalt's epic ""Star Wars"" monologue: It went viral a few years ago on YouTube. -- Cones of Dunshire: The greatest nerdy creation from the mind of Ben Wyatt. -- Leslie and Ben: For our money, they have been the couple to beat on network television for a while now.

"(CNN)As Wisconsin prepares to try two children as adults in an attempted murder case allegedly inspired by the mythical Slenderman, the prosecution of two preteens in adult court challenges our faith in the juvenile justice system. The entire juvenile justice system is premised upon one bedrock principle. It's an immutable fact that our parents and forebears have known for millennia, and it's something that science is increasingly backing up: Juveniles are different. They are irresponsible. They say the darndest things. I believe children are our future; teach them well and let them see the way. Show them all the beauty -- well, everything Whitney Houston said in that song, you get the point. The point is, this is why we have a juvenile justice system in the first place. Not only are children developmentally different, but even the Supreme Court has long recognized that they are also constitutionally different. As recognized by Justice Anthony Kennedy in a recent court opinion, a child's immaturity leads to recklessness, impulsiveness, and risky behavior. Children are more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures both from lousy family members and from ne'er-do-well peers. They have limited control over their environment and lack the capacity to extricate themselves from bad situations. The flipside to all this is that because a child's character is not as fixed as an adult's, bad behavior is not necessarily indicative of irretrievable depravity. Children are redeemable because they may simply ""grow out"" of their bad behavior. The bottom line, according to the court, is that these differences diminish the traditional penological justifications for harsh punishment of juveniles -- even when they commit the most horrific crimes. The juvenile justice system is different because kids are different. Modern science agrees, providing biological explanations for juvenile delinquency: . ""The most noteworthy features of adolescent brain development relate to changes occurring within the brain's frontal lobes -- in particular the prefrontal cortex -- and in the connections between the prefrontal cortex and other brain structures. These areas and interconnections are critical to 'executive' functions such as planning, motivation, judgment, and decisionmaking, including the evaluation of future consequences, the weighing of risk and reward, the perception and control of emotions, and the processing and inhibition of impulses,"" the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Association of Social Workers wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief filed with the Supreme Court in 2012. This research -- plus our firmly entrenched notions about juvenile responsibility -- have informed the operation of our juvenile justice system since its inception. Instead of punishment and incarceration, the juvenile system focuses on treatment and rehabilitation. At least that's the theory. But how is it executed? Typically, a juvenile court can send a child to a secure educational facility instead of prison, and juvenile courts generally lose jurisdiction over children at a statutory age -- usually anywhere from 21 to 25. Their juvenile records are customarily sealed and not public like adult criminal records. The idea is this: Once you are an adult, you get a fresh start. After all, your childish behavior is now behind you. Unless -- well, unless what you did was really, really, really bad. In that case? You're going to prison at Shawshank with the rest of the adults. Although all states differ, the general rule is this: Juvenile court has jurisdiction over a child unless he or she is alleged to have committed something awful, like murder or attempted murder, and then the case is automatically (or at the discretion of the court or prosecutor) placed in adult court, where the child is subject to adult penalties. But what happened to all that ""prefrontal cortex"" talk and the Supreme Court, and ""children are fundamentally different""? Apparently, children are different -- but if they really make us angry, they can go be different in prison. It's a paradox. We treat children according to their developmental culpability, with a colossal  exception: If the consequences of their behavior are really serious, we instead deal with them according to the outcome -- even though the biological genesis of that behavior remains exactly the same. If a child punches an adult, the child may land in juvenile court. If a child punches an adult, and that adult falls and dies, then the child might be in adult court. Same root causes of bad behavior, different judicial outcome. The neurology remains the same in all cases, but we inconsistently demand disparate treatment. Why the judicial hypocrisy?  It's as if society is saying it acknowledges all the science about adolescent brain development and is fine with it as long as we're talking about crimes like spray-painting cars, smoking pot, or a fistfight at school.  But for those most egregious crimes like murder, the scientific mumbo jumbo goes out the window. When kids kill, society wants retribution. Adult-style retribution. Maybe it's just legislative recognition of what we ultimately believe: Sure, child development has as a general rule that kids are redeemable, but there are exceptions to every rule. Some kids are just bad to the bone -- they are trouble, and they will always be trouble.  And if your mind just wandered to a specific kid in your neighborhood, maybe you agree with that concept. But there's probably one notable exception: your own kid. Your little snowflake is really a good kid and would never do anything wrong. When it comes to the juvenile system, we should address the inconsistency; it borders on hypocrisy. If we agree the juvenile mind is less culpable, we should treat it that way, without exception.","Two girls are accused of stabbing a friend to impress the fictional Slenderman .

"(CNN)Kids, our George Jetson, 007, Iron Man dreams are edging a bit closer to reality. Jetpack manufacturer Martin Aircraft of Christchurch, New Zealand, went public Tuesday on the Australian Stock Exchange. Stock prices soared, because who doesn't want a jetpack? After raising $21 million in its initial public offering, the company is promising 2016 delivery of its first model: a contraption  boasting a reported 30 minutes of flight time at a max speed of nearly 46 miles per hour and altitudes of up to 3,000 feet. Company founder Glenn Martin created the design over 30 years of night and weekend work in his garage. ""Commercial Jetpacks are no longer the domain of science fiction,"" the company's Managing Director and CEO, Peter Coker, said in a statement. ""The dream of Glenn Martin to create a commercial Jetpack is about to be realised."" The company must still work out regulatory and insurance issues, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper noted. And to be fair, plenty of inventors and companies have promised jetpacks, flying cars, robot maids and all the accoutrements of the future, with little to show for it. Martin, however, is undaunted. ""I always knew it would be a long road to develop a wearable jetpack,"" Martin told the newspaper. ""The United States military had thrown lots of cash at big companies in the 1950s and 1960s that failed to come up with anything practical, and here I was just a Kiwi bloke in a garage with a hobby."" The company is taking $5,000 deposits on a personal jetpack, but its first commercial product will be a first responder version designed for fire services, search and rescue, border security and other government and corporate clients. That version will sell for around $200,000, plus customization. Just one question: How many cupholders?","New Zealand jetpack company goes public, saying deliveries will begin in 2016 .

"Cairo (CNN)Everyone is on a mission to make up for lost time. At Baher Mohamed's home in Cairo, the Al Jazeera English journalist tries to get closer to his baby Haron, born while he was in prison. ""A few days ago I managed to make him smile,"" Mohamed told CNN. ""That's great progress. I missed six months of his life and I can't get those back."" His two other kids, Hazem, 5, and Fayrouz, 4, won't leave his side. For the 411 days he spent behind bars, they were told their father was at work. ""I told them every time they came to visit that I'm at work, I'm staying at work. They were still too young to live and to know about prison."" Mohamed now spends most of his time at home, tiptoeing away when he occasionally leaves so his children don't cry. And throughout the day he checks on Gatsby, his fur-heavy Caucasian Shepherd dog, that was shot by police who arrested Mohamed in December 2013. Mohamed was arrested with colleagues Mohamed Fahmy and Peter Greste. They were brought to trial with 17 others on charges of belonging to a terrorist organization -- the Muslim Brotherhood -- threatening Egypt's national security and airing false news, among others. Eleven were tried in absentia. Not all were journalists, nor had a clear connection to Al Jazeera English. The Cairo Criminal Court found them guilty in June 2014. Fahmy and Greste were sentenced to seven years in prison. Mohamed was sentenced to 10, receiving an extra three years for charges of possession of ammunition, a bullet he collected from the field while reporting in Libya. Mohamed broke down when he was taken from court that day. ""I was terrified for my wife, because my wife was pregnant at that time. And I felt sorry for my children, because if I spent 10 years in prison, then I will go out of prison and then they will be 10 years older. They will be teenagers. And I will miss all that time."" On January 1, the Court of Cassation, which represents the final stage of criminal appeals, sent the case for retrial, explaining in documents released to the official news agency that the original verdict failed to provide reasoning for the conviction. The court said there was insufficient evidence for charges of belonging to an illegal organization -- a reference to the Muslim Brotherhood -- how the defendants joined the group, or their knowledge of its objectives which allegedly included terrorism. Evidence and details for other charges such as possessing unlicensed broadcast equipment and receiving support from the Brotherhood were also lacking, the court said. It criticized the Criminal Court's handling of testimonies, search and arrest warrants, as well as confessions that defense lawyers claimed were made under duress. A month later, Greste became the first man to benefit from a new law issued last November allowing the president to deport foreigners held in Egypt. He arrived in his Australian home city of Brisbane days later. Fahmy, an Egyptian-Canadian citizen, gave up his Egyptian nationality in the hope of benefiting from the same law. He remained behind bars, though, and was only granted bail -- along with Mohamed -- on February 12. He told the court that day that he gave up his nationality reluctantly, and only after several high-ranking officials convinced him to do so. They told him ""nationality is not a piece of paper but it is in the heart. You can visit Egypt as a tourist and apply for citizenship again at the state council."" A new judge released all defendants pending a retrial. Fahmy was singled out to pay 250,000 Egyptian pounds (roughly $33,000) bail, because as a foreigner he had no official residence in Egypt. Being a foreigner brought difficulties. His plans to get married to his fiancee Marwa Omara were complicated by the fact that instead of seeking a cleric to officiate at the wedding, the couple now has to go through a bureaucratic process involving the foreign and justice ministries. But the couple said that despite the trauma of Fahmy's imprisonment, the experience brought them closer. ""Marwa is my hero. She was getting me all the news in prison and she was engaging with the lawyers and the media. She was basically my voice outside,"" Fahmy said. Sitting next to him, Omara said prison made him see life in a new light. ""He became a stronger person. He became much stronger. More emotional. More romantic than before."" Along with Mohamed, Fahmy spent the first few weeks of his detention in the maximum-security Scorpion prison in solitary confinement. A combination of sleeping on the floor and not getting the medical attention he needed at the time exacerbated a shoulder injury, limiting his arm's mobility. This is among many things that keep him angry. ""I'm furious, I get tantrums at night. I get angry. I used to get these tantrums in the cell,"" he said. ""The campaign and the support across that globe is great, but that's not what's going to get me out of prison. What is going to get me out of prison is a combination of a good lawyer, diplomatic engagement on the highest levels from Canada and Al Jazeera senior management."" Capitalizing on a months-long, worldwide campaign -- #FreeAJStaff"" -- by Al Jazeera, another campaign is urging the Canadian prime minister to push for Fahmy's extradition from Egypt.  Meanwhile, Fahmy has been more vocal in his criticism of his employer, accusing Al Jazeera management of negligence. One of many ongoing disagreements between the two sides is the legal representation. From the onset, Fahmy refused to work with Al Jazeera lawyers because he didn't think they were experienced enough. He hired a different attorney, whom, he claimed, Al Jazeera refused to pay. Al Jazeera said it paid for his lawyer and his bail and has learned the lessons from the first trial, by hiring the lawyers that won the retrial at the Court of Cassation. ""We did everything possible to secure his release and to avoid it happening in the first place. Every aspect of our response to the extreme incitement we've faced in Egypt since 2013 can be scrutinized in hindsight, and we've said in the past that lessons have been learned,"" the network said in a statement to CNN. The trial continues amid a backdrop of ongoing tension between Egypt and Qatar -- the small Middle Eastern country that finances Al Jazeera -- and increasing restrictions on freedoms in Egypt. A Cairo court had banned one of Al Jazeera's Arabic channels in 2013 citing a threat to national security. The channel was believed to be a threat to Egypt by supporting the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. The network contested another verdict in 2014 that banned Mubasher Masr from using the Egyptian satellite Nilesat. It eventually shut down the controversial channel in December 2014 during short-lived improvement in Egyptian-Qatari relations. In addition to accusations of politicization, the trial is also emblematic of the general environment in Egypt, where thousands have been imprisoned in a crackdown on dissent. Rights groups accuse the judiciary of rubberstamping police and prosecution charges rather than providing fair trials, resulting in mass sentences. Nagy Shehata, the judge that issued the first conviction against AJE journalists, has recently sentenced 183 people to death and 230 to life in prison in two other separate trials. ""They arrested us, not only me, I think to intimidate other journalists, to scare other journalists,"" said Mohamed, adding that the lack of evidence in court and disputes over legal representation are irrelevant in a case that is principally about press freedom. Mohamed says it is a battle he is willing to sacrifice everything for, emboldened by the solidarity of colleagues. Quoting an exchange of messages between him and jailed Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid Shawkan, he said: ""When there is one journalist behind bars, all journalists all over the world stand together just to free him. It's not about news organizations or networks, no. It's about us, it's about freedom of speech. This is what we stand for."" Shawkan has been held without charge since August 2013. At least eight other journalists remain behind bars, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. On March 8, all defendants will return to court for the next hearing of their retrial. In the meantime, they enjoy the ""mundane things in life,"" which for Fahmy means having dinner with his fiancee, or talking with his mother with ""no police cop watching you 24 hours a day."" Mohamed is enjoying being behind the wheel of his car -- and simply being outside. ""I saw the colors of the skies and this blue and purple and red. This color and this view made me feel this is freedom. It was the first time to see the sunrise in 411 days.""","Al Jazeera English journalist Baher Mohamed released on bail from prison in Egypt .

"(CNN)Football has faced plenty of problems over racist and homophobic chanting and now a British broadcaster wants action taken after fans allegedly sang songs which mocked people with disabilities. Kevin Kilbane, a former Republic of Ireland international who played with Everton in the English Premier League, reported West Ham supporters to the English Football Association for derogatory chants against Tottenham's Harry Kane during Sunday's game. The former winger, who now works for the BBC, was not at the game but was shocked to hear ""mong"" chants had been sung at the game. Kilbane was told about the chants by Andy Merriman -- a Tottenham season-ticket holder whose daughter lives with Down's syndrome. Kilbane's daughter Elsie has the same condition and he is a patron of the Down's Syndrome Association. ""The club emailed every supporter who had bought a ticket to Sunday's game to remind them that they were acting as ambassadors for West Ham United"" a West Ham spokesman said Monday. ""If any individual is found to have behaved in an inappropriate way, the Club's simple, zero-tolerance policy dictates that they will face the strongest possible action, including the option of a life ban from the Boleyn Ground. ""If anyone has any information on such behavior we would urge them to report it to the Club, Kick It Out or the police so it can be investigated thoroughly."" Tottenham were not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNN. ""I am sure they understand they are causing offence,"" Kilbane told the Guardian. ""You cannot sweep it under the carpet and label it as ignorance. It is visible and clear and, like racist or homophobic chanting, it is intended to cause offence."" The FA confirmed to CNN that Kilbane, among others, had reported the incident and has promised a thorough investigation into the allegations. ""I want to be able to take my kids to football matches and when Elsie gets older she will understand about her condition and I would not want her to hear that kind of chanting,"" said Kilbane. ""If her sister Isla heard it, she would be devastated too, as my friend's sons were"" said Kilbane. In another incident on Sunday a group of men -- thought to be West Ham fans -- were filmed chanting anti-Semitic abuse on a train in North London. Both episodes follow the racism storm that engulfed Chelsea after its fans pushed a black man out of a Paris Metro carriage last week.","Footballer turned TV presenter Kevin Kilbane reported West Ham fans' disablist chants to the FA .

"Hadley, Massachusetts (CNN)When my son was born, I picked the name Alexander because the baby names book said it meant ""Leader of Men,"" and I was sure he was destined for greatness. Here's how I pictured it:  He would be very smart, win awards, go to a prestigious university and maybe even be famous. At 5 months old, he still cried constantly, couldn't eat or sleep and wasn't really developing. And a heart condition was detected. His pediatrician suggested we have a geneticist look at him. It might be Williams syndrome, he said. I didn't know enough to be frightened, until I went to the hospital library where I worked and looked up the definition. Of the 25 things that could accompany Williams syndrome, seeing the words ""mental retardation"" shattered me the most. I pictured someone on the short school bus, rocking back and forth in the seat, watching the world through glass but not being allowed to be part of it. Nope. That would not be our fate. We would beat Williams syndrome, just the two of us if we had to. I quit my job, took Alex to therapy twice a day.  His older stepbrother, Kush, and I worked with him at home when he wasn't in therapy. As the years went by, Alex made progress, but at what cost? I became isolated and depressed. The other parents in our neighborhood made friends while their kids played together on the playground, but Alex couldn't walk or climb unattended. I wasn't about to let him sit in the wood chips by himself. We had work to do. With each evaluation, more deficits were revealed.  Every time, I asked what I could do to help my son.  The professionals patted me on the head and told me to accept his limitations. I dreamed of a place for Alex and I where there was laughter and happiness, where other parents who shared similar experiences could come together. I didn't want to choose between having friends and helping my son.  I needed both. By the time Alex was 4, I was a single parent.  With my three sons, I moved from Philadelphia to Amherst, Massachusetts, where the schools included kids with special needs in their regular classrooms. One by one, I met parents who were like me. One father would become my future husband. We noticed that even though our kids were technically included in school, it wasn't true inclusion. They were invited in, but they didn't have the skills to participate. They were often standing on the sidelines watching because they couldn't keep up or understand the rules. I shared my dream with my friends, and together we embarked on a journey to create a welcoming place where our kids would be understood and celebrated. In 2004, we opened Whole Children, a nonprofit where kids, teens and adults with disabilities can learn valuable skills to help them fully engage in the world around them.  Instead of assuming every individual who walks through the door can follow complex directions, we support them as they are and teach them skills they need to be meaningfully included in their schools and communities. The first year, we ran eight classes and served 26 families. Ten years later, we have around 75 classes a year, and we have grown to a community of 800 families. We laugh -- a lot. Our children have taught us not to be afraid of mistakes, so we've become fearless in our willingness to try. We frequently fail, which is the secret of our success. We understand, and are helping our communities understand, how much these unique and incredible children will grow up and enrich our community. It does not weaken us to make the effort to understand and include those who are different. It strengthens all of us. Alex is now 18.  He does ride a smaller bus to school, and he does rock.  We didn't beat Williams syndrome because he still has it, but at some point, that goal just became irrelevant. Alex is Alex.  He is an accomplished musician who aspires to be a DJ.  He is in his high school musical, has had starring roles in Whole Children's theater productions (everyone who wants a starring role gets one) and studies voice through a program at the University of Massachusetts. He recently gave a talk to a group of delegates from Azerbaijan who came to the United States to learn ways to improve their educational services for people with disabilities.  He made such an impression on them that when I traveled to Azerbaijan with a group of professionals to support their work, a delegate said, ""Alex is known all over Azerbaijan."" So in a way, he did become famous.","Carrie McGee's son Alex was diagnosed with Williams syndrome at 5 months old .

"The 911 caller, her voice quavering, says she's terrified because of what her brother had just told her. ""He says that he killed two guys. They went out to a shooting range. Like, he's all crazy ..."" Those recorded words from the sister of Eddie Ray Routh gave Texas authorities one of their first indications Saturday of death at an isolated shooting range. Routh, who was arrested hours after the call, is facing murder charges in the deaths of a military sniper and another man. Officials say Routh, a military veteran, killed the men on a gun range in a remote section of Rough Creek Lodge and Resort, which sprawls across 11,000 acres in Glen Rose, Texas, 90 minutes southwest of Dallas-Fort Worth. The Saturday afternoon call from Routh's sister, Laura Blevins, came from her home in Midlothian, some 30 miles southeast of Fort Worth, after Routh, she said, had come to visit her and her husband. ""He's left now, but he told me that he's committed a murder, and I'm terrified for my life because I don't know if he's going to come back here,"" Blevins says in the call, her words spilling out in a torrent of worry. ""I don't know if he's being honest with me."" Should vets with PTSD, mental illness still have access to guns? Asked for detail, she says, ""He says that he killed two guys. They went out to a shooting range. Like, he's all crazy. He's f****** psychotic. I'm sorry for my language. I don't know if he's on drugs or not."" In the recording of the call released Tuesday by the Midlothian Police Department, Blevins, saying she is nervous, hands the phone to her husband, Gaines. ""He said he killed two guys at a shooting range,"" Gaines Blevins says. ""He took one of the trucks, like a dark blue or maybe black F-250. He drove off. I'm not sure where he is right now."" The man says that Routh told him he had two guns in the Ford pickup truck. Though the 25-year-old Routh had not threatened the couple, ""he was talking kinda babble."" Asked whether Routh had been known to drink or take drugs, Gaines Blevins said, ""Yeah, he's been known to drink in the past -- and smoke pot."" The speaker adds that Routh, an ex-Marine, had recently been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, ""and he's been acting a little weird from that,"" and that he had left Green Oaks psychiatric hospital in Dallas the week before. The release of the 911 tape came a day after Erath County Sheriff Tommy Bryant said Routh was under 24-hour surveillance on suicide watch in a central Texas jail. Bryant has said Routh served for four years in the military, though it was unclear how much of that time, if any, was in combat zones. Shay Isham, a lawyer appointed to represent Routh, has said his client had spent roughly the last two years in and out in Veteran Affairs medical facilities for treatment of mental issues. Last September 2, Routh was crying, shirtless, shoeless and smelling of alcohol when police caught up with him walking the streets of his hometown of Lancaster, Texas. His family didn't understand what the Marine veteran was going through, he told the officer, according to a police report. He was taken then to a hospital for a mental evaluation and placed in protective custody after he had become angry that his father was going to sell his gun. His mother told police he had threatened to ""blow his brains out."" This was, Bryant said, after Routh's mother ""may have reached out to"" one of the victims -- Chris Kyle, author of the best-selling book ""American Sniper"" -- ""to try and help her son."" The suspect is ""a troubled veteran whom they were trying to help,"" said Craft International, a company founded by Kyle, who had tried to help veterans with PTSD since he retired from the Navy in 2009. Routh, Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, entered the resort and headed toward a gun range at 3:15 p.m. (4:15 p.m. ET) Saturday, according to authorities. Marcus Luttrell told CNN that Kyle, his friend, had gone to help Routh get ""out of the house (and) blow off some steam."" Around 5 p.m. Saturday, a hunting guide alerted authorities Kyle's and Littlefield's bodies had been discovered ""lying on the ground, covered in blood,"" according to an affidavit for the search warrant for Routh's house. By then, Routh allegedly had taken off in Kyle's black Ford pickup, stopping first at his sister's house about 70 miles away. Gaines Blevins said his brother-in-law said ""he'd traded his soul for a new truck and that he murdered two people,"" the affidavit says. ""He said they were out shooting target practice and he couldn't trust them so he killed them before they could kill him. He said he couldn't trust anyone anymore; everyone was out to get him."" Laura Blevins told her brother that if what he was saying was true, ""he needed to turn hisself in,"" it adds. But Routh set off again. At about 8 p.m., police caught up with him near his home in Lancaster, about 15 miles south of Dallas, and took him into custody. The motive for the killings was unclear. Routh ""is the only one that knows,"" Erath County Sheriff's Capt. Jason Upshaw told reporters on Sunday. ""I don't know that we'll ever know."" Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. CNN's Tom Watkins, Ed Lavandera, Josh Levs, Susan Candiotti, AnneClaire Stapleton, Barbara Starr, Emily Smith and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Bodies were found ""lying on the ground, covered in blood""

"Read a version of this story in Arabic. A former Navy SEAL known for claiming a record number of sniper killings in Iraq was one of two men shot dead at a Texas gun range, allegedly at the hands of a fellow military veteran, officials say. Chris Kyle, the author of the best-selling ""American Sniper,"" and Chad Littlefield, Kyle's friend, were gunned down Saturday afternoon on the grounds of the expansive Rough Creek Lodge and Resort in Glen Rose, Texas, southwest of Fort Worth, law enforcement officials said. About four hours afterward, and 90 miles from where those two men's bodies were found by a hunting guide, authorities arrested suspect Eddie Ray Routh, 25, on a capital murder warrant. Routh's family members could not be reached immediately for comment Sunday.  No attorney has made a public statement on his behalf. Erath County Sheriff Tommy Bryant said Sunday that he believes the suspect is in the process of seeking a court-appointed attorney. While Routh's sister said he had admitted shooting Kyle and Littlefield, he didn't explain to her why he did it, Bryant said. Routh isn't believed to have confessed to local authorities about killing the two men. The motive for the killings is unclear. ""I don't know that we'll ever know,"" Erath County Sheriff's Capt. Jason Upshaw said Sunday. ""(Routh) is the only one that knows that."" Sheriff: Suspect spent four years in Marines . The Rough Creek Lodge is a large facility that draws couples getting married, business people using its conference center and families looking for a getaway. Hunting and shooting sports are some of the many recreational options available on its grounds. Kyle, Littlefield and Routh were three such visitors, arriving together around 3:15 p.m. (4:15 p.m. ET) Saturday and proceeding to a shooting range within the resort's 11,000 acres, Bryant told reporters Sunday. The range is in a ""very remote part"" of the sprawling complex, Upshaw explained. ""So there wasn't anybody anywhere close to that,"" he said, explaining there are no known witnesses. The first sign something was wrong came when a hunting guide tied to the facility found  38-year-old Kyle and 35-year-old Littlefield -- both unconscious -- around 5 p.m., Bryant said. He went to the lodge and called 911. Law enforcement officers followed up and found the bodies but no sign of Routh. He had taken off in Kyle's black Ford pickup, the Erath County sheriff said. Around the time an all-points bulletin went out for that truck, authorities got a call from Routh's sister, who reported that her brother had driven about 65 miles to her home in Midlothian, Texas, and admitted to shooting Kyle and Littlefield. Routh left his sister's house, and police eventually caught up with him -- and the truck -- shortly before 8 p.m. at his home in Lancaster, a Dallas suburb some 90 miles northeast of the shooting scene. While talking with authorities outside, he'd somehow gotten back in the truck and sped away. Authorities chased him and finally stopped him, around 9 p.m., after spiking his tires some four to six miles down the road, according to Bryant. Routh did not struggle with officers as they were arresting him, Bryant said. On Sunday morning, he was arraigned on murder charges and ordered held on $3 million bond. After that, Routh sat in a jail cell ""all by himself,"" separated from the rest of the inmate population and watched closely by guards, according to Bryant. So who is Eddie Ray Routh? The sheriff said that Routh spent four years in the Marines. He is believed to have left the service in 2010, according to a U.S. military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. The official did not have information on where Routh served or whether he took part in combat. Public records show Routh previously lived at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, though his latest address was in Lancaster, Texas. At the time of shooting, he was unemployed. Bryant said that Routh's mother, a longtime schoolteacher, ""may have reached out to Mr. Kyle to try and help her son."" 'He led by example,' Kyle's friend says . Kyle learned to shoot on hunting trips with his father, then went on to serve four combat tours in Iraq with the SEALs, though his official biography notes he also worked with Army and Marine units. He received two Silver Stars and other commendations before leaving the Navy in 2009 -- claiming that, in his years as a sniper, he'd killed more than 150 people, which he called a record for an American. In the interview with Time magazine (like CNN, a part of Time Warner), Kyle said he did not regret any of his kills.  He also said he was ""comfortable"" with the possibility that that part of his life might be over. He added, ""I'm a better husband and father than I was a killer."" After having worked under the radar for so many years, he became a celebrity with the 2012 release of his book, which became a New York Times best-seller. Defending his decision to divulge so much detail despite the secretive nature of the SEAL world, Kyle told Time that he was ""not trying to glory myself."" ""I didn't want to put the number of kills I had in there,"" he said. ""I wanted to get it out about the sacrifices military families have to make."" He said that while killing did not come easy at first, he knew it meant saving lives. ""The first time, you're not even sure you can do it,"" he said in the interview. ""But I'm not over there looking at these people as people. I'm not wondering if he has a family. I'm just trying to keep my guys safe. Every time I kill someone, he can't plant an (improvised explosive device). You don't think twice about it."" At one point, Kyle wrote, he shot a woman who was carrying a grenade while with her toddler. But he did not kill a child in Baghdad's Sadr City area who had a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.  ""According to the rules of engagement at the time, you could kill anyone with an RPG on sight. That day I just couldn't kill the kid. He'll probably grow up and fight us, but I just didn't want to do it. He said the American public lives ""in a dream world. You have no idea what goes on on the other side of the world. The harsh realities that these people are doing to themselves and then to our guys. And there are certain things that need to be done to take care of them."" After leaving the military, he founded Craft International, a military training company. Kyle also spoke up on current events, including accusing President Barack Obama of being ""against the Second Amendment"" because of his gun control initiatives, according to a video interview with guns.com. 'Military-style' weapons and the law . The married father of two children established the nonprofit Fitco Cares Foundation to help veterans battling PTSD -- post-traumatic stress disorder -- get access to exercise equipment. Littlefield, who leaves behind a wife and children, was a friend who worked to help people with PTSD, said Fitco Director Travis Cox. In a statement, the foundation described Kyle as an ""American hero"" and pledged to carry on his mission. ""What began as a plea for help from Chris looking for in-home fitness equipment for his brothers- and sisters-in-arms"" struggling with PTSD turned into an organization that will continue after his death,"" Cox said in a statement. ""Chris died doing what he filled his heart with passion -- serving soldiers struggling with the fight to overcome PTSD. His service, life and premature death will never be in vain. May God watch over his family and all those who considered Chris a true friend.""

"(CNN)It may have seemed a herculean task, but retail workers have just scored an unprecedented win against a retail giant. Walmart, the nation's largest private employer, announced last week that it will raise the wages of approximately 500,000 of its employees by lifting its base wage to $10 by 2016 for current workers (and to the same rate for new hires after six months training). It's a step in the right direction, but not enough. To be sure, Walmart's announcement is an impressive development in the fight for better wages, not only because the retail powerhouse has earned a reputation for paying some of the lowest wages in the industry, but most importantly, because it was forced to make the change by its own workers. Over the past several years, Walmart employees -- united under the banner of OUR Walmart -- have engaged in protests and advocacy to press the retailer to improve compensation and working conditions in its more than 5,100 stores nationwide. These workers have held rallies, demanded to speak at shareholders meetings, and reached out to elected leaders and the general public. Their efforts are now starting to pay off, and no doubt, Walmart workers' success will serve as an inspiration to millions of other low-wage workers nationwide, making similar demands in the retail, restaurant and health care industries. But the fight is not quite over. Walmart's announcement falls short of what its workers are demanding: a minimum base wage of $15 per hour, the opportunity to work full-time for those who want it, predictability in their work schedules, and respect and dignity in workplaces. Walmart can afford to do much better than an increase to a meager $10 per hour. In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the company posted $16 billion or more in profits and returned between $7 billion and $13 billion to its shareholders. The Waltons, owners of Walmart, are worth $150 billion, which is more than the wealth of the entire bottom 40% of Americans. Walmart's owners, shareholders and executives have the hard work of its 1.3 million employees to thank for their incredible fortune. The company's announcement hardly qualifies the retailer as a leader among its peers.  A leading retail competitor, Costco, pays its employees a starting wage closer to $12 and an average wage of $21. Amazon also has a starting wage between $10 and $12, up to 20% higher than Walmart's newly increased wage. Insurance giant, Aetna, recently announced it will increase its base wage to $16 this April. A strong majority of small business owners support raising the minimum wage, and some already pay their employees substantially more than Walmart's new offer -- such as Detroit's Moo Cluck Moo, a burger restaurant chain whose workers earn $15 an hour. Walmart's new wages also fall significantly short of what the general public demands. According to a January 2015 poll conducted by Hart Research Associates for the National Employment Law Project, in a representative national sample of 1,002 adults, three in four Americans, including 53% of Republicans, support raising the federal minimum wage to $12.50, and 63% want the minimum wage increased to $15 per hour by 2020. This is because Americans understand that every additional penny that goes into the pockets of low-wage workers is invested back into the economy right away to pay for basic necessities, such as groceries, medicine, gas and transportation costs, resulting in a ripple effect that benefits the economy, boosts consumer demand and creates new jobs. In its announcement, Walmart's executives seemed to acknowledge as much, crediting the public's increased spending power for the company's success in fiscal year 2015 and stating that more work remains to be done to grow its business and bottom line. Walmart would be wise to include a substantially higher pay raise for its workers as a key part of its growth plans for the next few years.  Until they do, Walmart workers will keep up their fight -- emboldened by a major breakthrough that few thought was possible.","Yannet Lathrop: Walmart announced it's raising base wage to $10/hour for its 500,000 workers -- a good step, but not enough .
She says workers wanted $15 and full-time opportunities. Other companies do this; workers must keep pushing Walmart ."
"(CNN)It is noon, and the light filters softly through the water. Guillem Valle, camera in tow, drifts to the sea floor to capture an intimate portrait of a Badjao man. In the dreamlike photograph, the Badjao extends his hand upward as though he were dancing. ""All these movements they do with their hands,"" Valle said. ""They're trying to keep themselves down (on the seafloor), move forward or stay in place."" The Badjao are a tribe of nomadic sea dwellers who have lived off the shore of northeast Borneo for more than 200 years. They are a stateless people with no nationality in the traditional sense, residing instead in boats and living off the sea. As highly skilled divers, the Badjao are able to walk along the seafloor hunting for fish and pearls. Valle sought to photograph the Badjao as part of a larger project about stateless people that has taken him to places such as Kosovo, China, South Sudan and the Palestinian territories. ""The project is a question,"" Valle said. ""Why do we need to have flags and borders?"" Valle said that in recent years, increasing amounts of Badjao are transitioning to a life on land. Their background as a stateless people, however, awards them no recognition by the Malaysian government or access to things such as health care or education. ""They don't speak Malay or even know how old they are,"" Valle said. Despite the pull toward a more modern way of living, there are still Badjao who choose life at sea. But even sea dwellers feel the effects of modernization. ""They don't dive so much anymore,"" Valle said. ""They use more modern methods (of fishing). They sell fish to different companies and tourists, even to land Badjaos."" Valle wanted his photographs to reflect the essence of their statelessness, to create a sort of ""imaginary stateless nation."" The images are ethereal and emotional underwater portraits of the Badjao in their natural environment. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. ""I wanted to show who they are,"" he said. ""I didn't want to create some sort of anthropology catalog. I wanted to go beyond who's who. These underwater portraits were perfect for that."" This project was the first time Valle photographed underwater. ""I had never even dived before,"" he said. Underwater photography requires special equipment, like housing for the camera, and the weather conditions must be perfect. ""The sea must be calm and the water must be clean,"" he said. ""You need the sun to be as high as possible."" Although the type of diving Valle did with the Badjao can be dangerous, he did it without an oxygen tank. He experienced rain and a hailstorm his first two days of shooting. Around the third day, Valle began to gain the trust of the Badjao and they, in turn, began to understand the type of image Valle wanted. ""They're posing in all of the pictures,"" Valle said. ""I told them, 'I want to show what you normally do.' After we got the first picture, they understood what we wanted."" The soft light and the way the Badjao pose in the water reflect the ""imaginary stateless nation"" Valle wanted to convey, causing the viewer to examine the relationship between place and identity.

"(CNN)Police have arrested four students from Wesleyan University in connection with a drug overdose over the weekend. They are to appear in court next week. Ten students and two visitors were hospitalized Sunday from complications arising from the use of the drug Molly or from alcohol. The Middletown, Connecticut, Police Department reported that 11 were hospitalized because of Molly and one because of alcohol. The arrested students were Andrew Olson, 20; Rama Agha Al Kakib, 20; Eric Lonergan, 21, and Zachary Kramer, 21, police said in a statement. They face charges ranging from possession of a controlled substance and possession of a hallucinogen to possession of drug paraphernalia. Lonergan faces 16 counts of illegally obtaining or supplying drugs. Wesleyan University has suspended the students. University President Michael S. Roth has described Molly as a refined form of MDMA with ""extremely dangerous"" effects. MDMA is the active ingredient in the drug ecstasy. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, most often Molly is not MDMA, but a toxic mixture of lab-created chemicals. And Middletown police said on Tuesday that they expect multiple designer drugs were in the Molly. They have executed four search warrants to find out more about where the drugs came from. Most of the chemicals are meant to stimulate the central nervous system to cause euphoric highs.

"(CNN)Catfish come in all varieties, shapes and sizes, some big and some small. And one downright gigantic, apparently now swimming in a river in Italy. That's the fish story being told by Dino Ferrari, who reeled in a 280-pound (127-kilogram), 8.75-foot-long catfish last Thursday along the Po River, said Davide Valla, who is with Ferrari's sponsor company Sportex. (The sponsored fisherman wouldn't say exactly where he caught the big fellow, choosing to keep his favorite spots secret.) Assuming the world isn't being hooked, this would not be the first time someone has caught a whopper of a catfish and lived to tell the tale. In fact, it wouldn't be the biggest catfish ever caught. That would be a nearly 342-pound lau-lau (or piraiba) type of catfish snared in 2009 in Brazil's Amazon region, according to the International Game Fish Association. Heck, it's not even the biggest catfish ever snared in Italy. That honor goes to a 298-pound wels catfish -- which is reportedly the same variety caught by Ferrari -- also from the Po River. And Ferrari didn't necessarily bring his fish in alone, with stories linked from Sportex's Facebook page indicating that twin brother Dario was by his side. One thing that makes the latest Po River catch unique is that it was done with a spinning reel, said Valla, who called it a record for such fishing tackle. It took Ferrari 40 minutes to bring in the fish, then bring it to shore, his sponsor said. Once it was on land, the Ferraris snapped some photos and weighed their catch. But they didn't dig in, savoring it with fresh bread, cheese and a glass of pinot grigio. That's because this fish story has a happy ending for the star of the show: the catfish. According to Valla, Ferrari released his big catch back into the river.

"London (CNN)A fake cyberattack was staged against a landmark telecommunications building, but it was no mere academic exercise for self-taught ""ethical hackers"" fighting cyberterrorism. The do-good hackers were indeed engaged in a serious race against the clock to solve the simulated hack, but the real prize was a chance to be identified as as undiscovered genius and potential hero some day in defending queen and country against a future, real cyberattack. There were also potential job offers on the line. That was the goal of Cyber Security Challenge UK on Saturday, one of a series of inspirational competitions designed to find the next digital genius to defend Britain against devastating cyberattacks whose crimes cost the global economy an estimated $400 billion annually, according to a recent report. On Wednesday, the UK government also warned that a third of the country's small- and medium-sized companies are vulnerable to losing valuable data and customers to hacking. Those firms mistakenly believe in cybersecurity ""myths"" that hacking isn't likely to happen to them, the government's Cyber Streetwise campaign said. In all, 24 contestants who were largely self-taught hackers raced against a clock in an exercise to restore power to London's BT Tower, which had been shut down and taken over by cyberterrorists. Last weekend's simulated attack was sponsored by the National Crime Agency, defense contractor Raytheon and UK telecommunications giant BT. The drill offered a theatrical edge to the ""ethical hackers,"" whose job is to hack a network to evaluate security rather than do criminal damage. The simulation featured a video message from the bad guys, who called themselves ""Flag Day Associates,"" also posted on YouTube. The competitors, ages 20 to 50, attempted to restore power to the BT Tower, a communications hub whose Cold War architecture has been described as ""alienating"" and ""foreboding,"" according to the tour guide website Londonist. The tower, however, offers spectacular views of London, especially from an upper floor suite that rotates at the top, where the contest was held. The skyscraper was designed to withstand a nuclear blast with a war room in the basement. The participants worked in teams of four and sought to win the challenge so that they could advance to a master class, to take place in March and include a total of 42 winners from other competitions. The good-guy hackers had to decide which programs and techniques to use to discover a new password and trace the cyberterrorists' path, so that the code breakers could reverse the attack. During the competition, participants worked feverishly, and hamburgers remained half-eaten as fingertips tapped away at keyboards. The contestants worked without break for an hour. The teams were identified by colors, and in the end, it was Team Orange that won the challenge, earning its place in the master class final in London on March 12, joining other nationwide winners from prior rounds of similar contests. To illustrate that electricity was restored and the challenge over, the tower dramatically rotated 360 degrees, a rare spin for the crown of the building. Paul Crichard, Raytheon cybersecurity manager, said his research team has found recruits from what seem may the most unlikely walks of life: One was a ballroom dancer teacher and another was a welder. He hoped to find more hidden talent from the contest. ""Well this shows how good they are, and it means it is easy for us to come and say actually this person is really talented. They just need a helping hand to get into cybersecurity,"" he added. ""These are some of the best talents we have that aren't in the cybersecurity business today. These are ones who are really spending their own time to be skilled, to understand what is going on in the IT world and where the risks are, and those are the people we can't find through normal recruitment because perhaps they don't think they are good enough,"" Crichard said. Experts from National Crime Agency, BT, Raytheon and Airbus Group evaluated the performance of the code breakers. ""We give people the skills to be able to remain on the right side of the law,"" said Robert Partridge, head of BT Security Academy. ""Of course, it is always down to the individual what path they take, but we will give them the utmost encouragement to choose the right side of the law."" The challenge began in 2010 as a government initiative to tackle the growing level of cybercrime in the United Kingdom. The issue has become urgent because UK schools had overlooked computer science. As growing cyberthreats worry government and business, a huge skill shortage has emerged. Though computer science is now making a comeback to UK classrooms, there remains a generational gap, organizers said. Cybercrime stands as one of the UK's biggest threats, and the competition is a crucial initiative in finding raw talent for the UK government and the country's corporations. Many contestants are so raw that they never took formal training, said Stephanie Daman, CEO of  UK Cyber Security Challenge. ""Some of them are at university, but you'll find an awful lot of these people have learned these skills by going to Google and taught themselves,"" Daman said. ""We hope to persuade them to formalize those skills and move into jobs."" About 19,000 people in the UK registered to participate in the challenge. But only 3,000 of them are selected for the annual event, and from that pool, about 100 are selected to take part in one of four cyberattack simulations, such as the mock attack on the BT Tower on Saturday. Even if a contestant doesn't win or make it to the final round, 80 to 100 code breakers are hired every year by companies that use the competition as a recruiting ground, organizers said. For their efforts and as a possible item on their resumes, every contestant receives a certificate of having participated in the ""face-to-face"" competition against the fictional cyberterrorists. CNN's Kellie Morgan contributed from London. Michael Martinez wrote from Los Angeles.","19,000 ""ethical hackers"" register to compete in Cyber Security Challenge UK .

"(CNN)The death of a 14-year-old shot by police just blocks from his school is the latest flashpoint as political tensions mount in Venezuela and pockets of anti-government protests erupt throughout the country. Kluibert Roa Nuñez, a high school student, was killed Tuesday when he got caught between protesters and national police in the western city of San Cristobal. A police officer fatally shot Kluibert, officials say. The government and the opposition alike have condemned the teen's killing, but Venezuela's recent history of violence and sharp political polarization hang over this shooting. Already protesters opposed to President Nicolas Maduro's government are pointing to the teen's death as a fresh rallying cry. And Maduro has blamed protesters for the violence that led to the shooting. A year ago, San Cristobal was the birthplace of anti-government protests that spread nationwide. The standoffs between security forces and protesters lingered for weeks and became violent, with more than 40 deaths, according to the government. Three witnesses at Tuesday's protest said that Kluibert was not a protester and had inadvertently come across the confrontation after leaving school. Vivian Nuñez, the slain teen's mother, told CNN en Español her son was walking four blocks from his school when a riot broke out around him. The protesters -- mostly students from a nearby university -- were running from police at the moment that Kluibert walked into the area, according to the witnesses, who spoke with CNN en Español. The teen tried to protect himself by ducking under a car but suffered a direct shot from an officer's firearm, the witnesses said. CNN has not independently confirmed how the shooting unfolded. The governor of the state of Tachira, where San Cristobal is located, declined to comment on his government's version of events. The teen's death sparked several protests around the country Wednesday. In Caracas, demonstrators outside the justice ministry held up notebooks smeared with red paint to symbolize the blood of the country's youth they say has been spilled. ""A bloody notebook. This is what we, the students, have -- ideas,"" protester Hilda Rubi said. ""We say to Mr. Nicolas Maduro, 'Are you afraid of the students? These are our weapons: a notebook, pens, thoughts and ideology.' "" The Venezuelan government responded quickly to the killing, detaining and identifying the national police officer who shot the teen. The interior ministry named Javier Mora Ortiz, 23, as the shooter. Attorney General Luisa Ortega Díaz announced Wednesday that Mora is formally charged with intentional homicide, and that nine protesters were also arrested in San Cristobal. Interior Minister Carmen Melendez, speaking on state television, vowed that the officer would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. She appealed for calm, asking students to remember the 43 deaths recorded in clashes last year. The police has been reformed since then, she said, calling the national police force a ""protector of human rights."" ""This is an isolated incident that does not represent the behavior of the new, humanist police,"" Melendez said. To protesters, and to the family of the slain teen, these comments seem to be insincere, or outright lies. Erick Roa, the father of the slain teen, told CNN en Español's Fernando del Rincon that he wants the full weight of the law to be applied to the officer but is not comforted by the government's actions. The officer's quick confession might be part of a strategy to get a lenient sentence, Roa said. He is afraid the justice system will go easy on Mora because he is a police officer. ""This was a murder; this was a homicide committed by this man, and he should pay with the full weight of the law,"" he said. The father also questioned the government's claims of what kind of projectile killed his son. The interior minister said Mora shot Kluibert with a shotgun loaded with rubber pellets. Roa said that if the weapon was indeed a shotgun, it was loaded with lead pellets, not rubber. The coroner's report said that a firearm caused the fatal wound, without detailing whether it was rubber or lead pellets, the father said. The government also said that police provided first aid to the injured teen, something that witnesses deny. Roa pleaded for police to ""be guardians"" while on duty, saying he hopes another child won't become a victim. The fury over Tuesday's shooting echoes the arguments made by pro- and anti-government groups in the past. Maduro framed the boy's death around the actions of the protesters in San Cristobal. He described a group of ""hooded youths"" who were ""being violent,"" beating police and pelting officers with rocks before police responded with force. Critics of the government turned to one of their most powerful tools -- social media -- to accuse the security forces of abuses and to share photos they say back their allegations. Tweets were tagged with #SOSVenezuela, #PrayForVenezuela and #MaduroAsesinoDeEstudiantes, literally accusing the President of killing students. Government supporters tweeted under the banner #ApoyoRotundoAMaduro, or ""complete support for Maduro."" All this turmoil comes during an economic crisis in oil-rich Venezuela. Venezuelans have endured years of shortages of basic goods, products and services. Consumers have to stand in line for hours for staples such as milk, chicken and cornmeal. Even toilet paper and condoms are scarce. Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, is overvalued. The official exchange rate is 6.3 per dollar, but dollars are being exchanged in the black market at 190-to-1 creating all kinds of problems for foreign companies, including American ones. Last week, the mayor of Caracas, Venezuela's capital and largest city, was arrested and accused of plotting to overthrow Maduro's government. In fragile economy, Venezuela arrests opposition figures: Why you should care . Mayor Antonio Ledezma, one of the opposition's most visible leaders, was arrested in a raid by federal agents. The opposition says the mayor's arrest is an attempt to divert attention from the country's economic woes. CNN's Kay Guerrero, Miguel Escalona and Catherine E.

"Hundreds of thousands of Catalans in northeastern Spain are due to increase pressure on Madrid for an independent, breakaway state Wednesday by forming a human chain for 400 kilometers (about 250 miles). The human chain is organized by the grass-roots, citizen-led Catalan National Assembly, which last year on September 11 -- Catalonia's national day -- turned out an estimated 1.5 million people in Barcelona, the regional capital. Catalan politicians followed up by demanding a referendum on self-determination by the end of 2014, which the Spanish government in Madrid staunchly opposes. Spain's next threat: Losing 20% of its economy . While the political battle continues between Spain's two largest cities, Madrid and Barcelona, the human chain has emerged as the latest rallying point. Organizers say 370,000 Catalans have signed up to take part, and they predict tens of thousands more will also participate. The chain will traverse Catalonia from the north, near the French border, to the south, on its border with the Spanish region of Valencia. ""It will be an innocent but powerful image to push the process ahead, holding hands,"" said Alfred Bosch, who represents Catalonia's pro-independence Republican Left party in Spanish Parliament in Madrid. Dubbed the ""Catalan Way Toward Independence,"" the human chain shows the process can only ""go ahead, forward, and not back,"" Bosch said. But the Spanish government doubts that. It says that Catalonia, with 7.5 million people, already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. Catalonia's fight for independence: Lessons from the Dutch . And Madrid insists that the Spanish Constitution does not allow any of Spain's 17 regions to unilaterally break away, even one like Catalonia that has its own flag and language. On the eve of the human chain, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo said political leaders should find a way to keep Catalonia within Spain. But Catalan's president, Artur Mas, in an opinion article published Wednesday in The New York Times, wrote: ""We ... seek no harm to Spain. We are bound together by geography, history and our people, as more than 40 percent of Catalonia's population came from other parts of Spain or has close family ties. We want to be Spain's brother, as equal partners."" Catalan parliament pushes self-determination . Catalonia says it's been the junior partner for too long. It produces 19% of Spain's wealth and says it sends far more in taxes to Madrid than it gets back in central government spending. It recalls a long history of slights, and at certain times outright repression, by Spain. The human chain will start at 17:14 local time (11:14 a.m. ET), to honor Catalans who on September 11, 1714, lost a decisive battle to Spanish troops. The chain will last about an hour. The current polemic is not just between Catalonia and Spain. Within Catalonia, there is also tension between leading political forces over the timing, and the potential wording, of the referendum. President Mas, whose center-right Convergence and Union party governs only because of support from the Republican Left, seemed to leave the door open last week for a vote on self-determination later than 2014, perhaps in 2016. He has since repeated that he favors the 2014 deadline. But the Republican Left and those organizing the human chain insist it must be by the end of 2014, with or without the consent of Madrid. Various opinion polls show a very large majority of Catalans want the right of self-determination. But if independence makes it to the ballot, polls show the result could be tighter, some predicting a victory in the 50% range.","Organizers say 370,000 people have signed up to take part .

"(CNN)A war with Ukraine would be ""apocalyptic"" but will probably never happen, Russian President Vladimir Putin said. ""I believe such (an) apocalyptic scenario is unlikely, and hope that it will never get to that point,"" he told Russian media Monday. Putin said he's confident the crisis will stabilize if the Minsk Agreement is implemented. The accord, between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany,  includes a ceasefire between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists and an agreement for both sides to pull back heavy weapons. Despite frequent violations of the ceasefire, Putin said there's no need for immediate action beyond the Minsk Agreement, such as more international peace talks or the formal recognition of rebel separatist groups like the People's Republic of Donetsk and the People's Republic of Lugansk. ""I really hope (the Minsk Agreement) is implemented, and if it is -- it is the right way to normalization of situation in that Ukrainian region,"" Putin said. But the chaos on the ground in eastern Ukraine suggests the truce is crumbling. In the past week, shelling has intensified in the city of Donetsk. And on Friday, Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council reported 300 violations of the ceasefire, which was less than a week old. Ukraine has said its forces won't back down until attacks from the rebels stop. Pro-Russian separatists have also accused Ukraine of instigating violence. In his interview, Putin also said there's no chance Crimea -- which was annexed by Russia last year -- will go back in Ukraine. ""Regarding the return of any territories, such things are of revengeful nature, and it is not about return of some territories somewhere,"" Putin said . ""Crimea will remain Russian, Ukrainian, Tatar, Greek, and German -- it will be a home to all these nations. With regard to its nationality, Crimean people made their choice, which we must respect."" On the streets of Moscow, many Russian point their fingers at the United States for the Ukraine crisis. The latest polls show 81% of Russians have a negative view of the U.S. -- the highest number since the collapse of the Soviet Union. State-run media reports the United States wants to encroach on Russia. And the Kremlin's propaganda campaign seems to be paying off. ""My attitude to America is bad,"" one woman said. ""The way I watch the news, I realize the Americans want to get a hold of half of Russia."" Russia has denied widespread claims that it is supporting the pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine and has sent its own troops to the border. The United Nations says more than 5,000 people have been killed since mid-April amid the fighting between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian troops. Many of those killed were civilians.

"(CNN)Do black people have a history? There have always been doubters. In 1843 Noah Webster, said by some to be the founding father of American scholarship and education, was asked by black minister Amos Beman to share ""some account of the origin of the African race."" Of Africans, Webster replied, ""there is no history, and there can be none."" To be outside of history in Webster's view, was to be in a permanent state of ""barbarism,"" without the benefit of Europe's civilizing influence. Webster's view is no throwback. Take the 2007 example of then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy who, during a state visit to Senegal, remarked: ""The tragedy of Africa is that the African has not fully entered into history."" Sarkozy deemed Africa a place unaffected by change and without a capacity for progress, and thus beyond historical analysis. Neither Webster nor Sarkozy was correct, of course. Scholars of Africa and its Diaspora -- in the 19th century and today -- have refuted the notion that black people have ever existed outside of history. Their studies explain the evolution of varied black cultures with complex political, economic and social pasts.  African empires, we learn for example, were as ancient and as brilliant as any of Europe. Black History Month has provided one response to these questions. But today it has critics. Filmmaker Shukree Hassan Tilghman asked whether it was time to do away with Black History Month in his 2010 documentary, ""More Than a Month."" Tilghman captured the controversy that surrounds who tells black history and by what terms. Some critics suggest that a one month ritual is inadequate to the task. The hashtag campaign #28daysarenotenough is being used to express the impossibility of exploring the entirety of the black past in one month's time. But others go further, advocating that the month should fall victim to its own success. Black history, in this view, is an established part of American history. Relegating the subject its own month segregates African American history from the ""we"" in ""we the people."" Black History Month grew out of a desire to make the black past visible. In 1926, Harvard-trained historian Carter G. Woodson sought to challenge the myth that black people were without a history. His platform was the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (today's Association for the Study of African-American Life and History). Woodson's Association created the Journal of Negro History to promote research and writing on Africa and its Diaspora in an era during which much of the historical profession was indifferent to the subject. Woodson began with just a week. He noted how in early February Americans celebrated the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and deemed it Black History Week. Woodson's goal was to make history available to teachers, students and the public. The Civil Rights and Black Power movements fueled interest, so much so that by 1976, the association expanded the national marking of black history to the month that we know today. To some degree, Woodson's goals have been realized. Black history is a major subject of research and writing, in mainstream as well as in historically black colleges and universities. This work reaches beyond educational settings, into popular culture. The recent historical films ""Selma"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" grew out of long-standing scholarly interest in their subjects. Still, as we face new frontiers of knowledge, Black History Month's ongoing importance is clear.. I learned this first hand while researching, with students at the University of Michigan, the life of Arabella Chapman, a free African American woman who chronicled post-Civil War life in a unique photo collection. Chapman's beautifully preserved, leather-bound photo albums from the 1890s are in our library. To bring her story to a broader public, we set our sights on Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia. We got stuck, and through the Global Women of Color Write-In we learned that African American subjects like ours are under-represented in Wikipedia. We did get Chapman a page, but there was more work to do. Enter Black History Month. This year, the Wikipedia Foundation has partnered with institutions such as Washington's Howard University to ensure that black people have a history, Wikipedia style. And, last Thursday night, a faculty-student team gathered in Howard's Moorland-Spingarn Library to create some of those missing entries. Black history is not a static subject. Carter Woodson's association will mark its 100th anniversary in 2015 as a thriving site for the production of new historical understanding. Nor can black history be taken for granted. With the emergence of new learning resources and technologies comes the task of reasserting the relevance of Africa and its Diaspora. Carter Woodson's vision stands the test of time. And his approach -- which we call Black History Month -- helps ensure that understandings of the black past extend beyond ivy-covered towers and into the lives of students, teachers and the world. The opinions expressed are solely those of Martha S. Jones.","Historian Carter G. Woodson created Black History Week to highlight the history and achievements of African Americans .

"(CNN)Lady Gaga is joining the ""American Horror Story"" family. The Grammy-winning pop culture icon has been tapped to star in Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk's FX anthology, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Gaga — aka Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta — will make her series regular acting debut on the fifth season of the horror series. She becomes the first confirmed casting for the next incarnation of the Emmy-nominated drama. See More: 'American Horror Story's' Most Memorable Deaths: Which is the Most Shocking? Gaga's casting (which comes shorty after Oscars tribute to Julie Andrews dominated social media as well as her engagement to Chicago Fire star Taylor Kinney) is the latest coup for Murphy, who previously persuaded leading ladies including Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates to join his ever-evolving AHS. Gaga also becomes the latest pop icon to join one of Murphy's shows after former American Idol breakout Adam Lambert nabbed a recurring role on Fox's Glee. Details about the premise of season five are being kept under wraps. But the season's subtitle is typically announced during PaleyFest in March. Her role also comes after ""Freak Show,"" the fourth incarnation of the anthology, featured a number of musical performances by cast members Lange, Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters. The casting continues Murphy's relationship with Gaga, who ranks as one of the world's most influential people and holds 13 Guinness World Records and who has been an advocate for the LGBT community. Fox's musical dramedy Glee previously featured an entire tribute episode to Gaga during its freshman season and has featured a number of her iconic songs including ""Poker Face,"" ""Bad Romance,"" ""Telephone"" and ""Born This Way,"" among others. For Gaga, the role marks her largest TV gig to date and first series regular scripted gig after multiple appearances on unscripted fare including ""So You Think You Can Dance,"" ""The X Factor"" and ""American Idol."" For ""AHS,"" meanwhile, Gaga's casting arrives as the future of the anthology's leading ladies remains in question. Star Lange has repeatedly said that season four — Freak Show — would likely be her last; co-star Sarah Paulson is set to star as Marcia Clark in Murphy's FX anthology ""American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson;"" and Emma Roberts is poised to topline Fox's horror comedy anthology ""Scream Queens"" alongside ""Glee's"" Lea Michele. Two-time co-star Taissa Farmiga (""Murder House,"" ""Coven"") recently signed on to co-star in ABC's anthology, ""L.A. Crime."" Bates, meanwhile, is expected to return for season five. Gaga is repped by WME and Grubman Shire. Season five of American Horror Story will likely debut in October; a specific premiere date has not yet been determined.","The singer will make her series acting debut .

"The tense, high-stakes standoff between Ukraine and Russia continued Tuesday, with both sides insisting they don't want war but publicly offering little evidence of their willingness to budge. Petro Poroshenko, a Ukrainian parliamentarian who has been charged with leading negotiations with the new government of Crimea -- a disputed region thought to be threatened by a Russian takeover -- told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that ""today we (had) the first sign of contact between our minister of defense and Russia's minister of defense,"" as well as talks involving other ministers. ""But it is not a negotiation, unfortunately,"" said Poroshenko, a billionaire businessman and former Ukrainian foreign minister. ""We try to do our best to use any opportunity for peaceful negotiation. But ... we don't have any sign of hope ... from the Russian side."" The comments are the latest indicating Ukrainian officials' attempts to peacefully prevent a full-scale war over the Crimean peninsula, which had been part of Russia until it was ceded to Ukraine in 1954 by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. Yuriy Sergeyev, Ukraine's U.N. ambassador, claimed Russia used planes, boats and helicopters to flood the peninsula with 16,000 troops. And Ukrainian officials say disguised Russian troops have laid siege to military installations. Yet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday denied sending members of his military into Crimea or that any of the up to 25,000 Russian troops already stationed in the country had any role in the standoff, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. He insisted his military isn't planning to seize the Crimean peninsula -- but didn't close the door on action ""to protect local people."" Should Russian troops intervene, Putin said, ""It will be legitimate and correspond to international law because we have a direct request from a legitimate president and it corresponds to our interests in protecting people who are close to us."" Poroshenko said ousted Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Russia last week after months of public unrest against his government that ultimately boiled over into violence, has no legitimacy. That includes having no right to ask Russia to send troops into Ukraine to restore him to what he feels is his rightful post as President, according to Poroshenko, who insisted only Parliament can invite foreign troops. ""His (political tenure) is finished, and he is a criminal,"" said Poroshenko, ""especially after yesterday's appeal to have foreign troops come here and start a war."" Tension, uncertainty in Crimea . While no blood has been spilled between the Ukrainian and Russian militaries, no one is breathing easy -- especially amid reports of Ukrainian military facilities in Crimea being under siege. On Sunday, a U.S. official said Russian forces have ""complete operational control"" of Crimea. And Putin said Tuesday ""local militias"" -- who, he insisted, don't answer to Moscow -- control up to 22,000 Ukrainian army troops and their heavy military equipment. Poroshenko, the Ukrainian official, said that while military units have been ""blocked,"" they have not relinquished control. ""Our soldiers (are) demonstrating a strong spirit,"" he added, commending them for not opening fire. Sounds and images from the ground showcase the tension -- and confusion. Several hundred men wearing dark green camouflage uniforms without insignias surrounded Ukraine's Perevalnoye base Sunday near the Crimean capital of Simferopol. But rather than the standoff, they walked peacefully near 15 Ukrainian troops standing guard. By Tuesday, the situation remained tense, and the base was still surrounded. But the base commander moved in and out, and troops outside weren't stopping anyone. But not every scene was so calm. Video showed more than 100 unarmed Ukrainian troops trying Tuesday morning to return to Belbek air base north of Sevastopol, only to have Russian forces fire warning shots over their heads. A Russian voice tells the Ukrainians he has orders to shoot them in the legs if they advance. The Ukrainian commander reports they have no weapons, and the Russians are in control. After some negotiations, 15 Ukrainian troops are let in. By contrast, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) southeast of Simferopol, about 100 Russian troops on Tuesday parked their vehicles at a Ukrainian military base, excavated mini-trenches and erected mess tents -- all while having civil conversations with Ukrainian troops and moving about freely. What's happening on the Russian side of the Ukraine border, though, may end up being more significant. Putin ordered about 150,000 Russian troops who had been taking part in military exercises near the border back to their barracks. But that order didn't involve troops already in Crimea, nor did it reassure Ukraine's new interim leadership based in the capital of Kiev. Russian troops and vehicles remain near the country's eastern border, according to Ukrainian officials. Andriy Parubiy, head of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told Parliament that Ukraine doubled its security presence at checkpoints along the border. As the governments jostle, Ukrainian citizens are in limbo. Alex Shiroki, from the coastal city of Yalta, said he is worried about being cut off from gas, electricity or the Internet, as well as the prospect of living under Russian rule. But he admits not everyone shares his opinion; even in his own family, one of his sisters wants a plan to get out while another sister sides completely with Russia. ""The worst feeling is that I feel unsure about what will be tomorrow,"" Shiroki said. ""My thoughts are: This won't end fast."" Kerry: U.S. 'will stand by the Ukrainian people' Diplomatic efforts to end the crisis bore little fruit Tuesday. Poroshenko, who is heading Ukraine's efforts to forge a peaceful resolution over Crimea, said his government is ""constantly trying to"" have conversations with Moscow. ""We think that, without any negotiating ... the escalation process and the temperature on the Crimea is rising up,"" he added. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to construct what a senior U.S. administration official characterized as an ""off-ramp"" for Putin by having international observers in Crimea to ensure ethnic Russians' rights aren't violated. President Barack Obama floated this idea in a call Saturday with Putin, and he and Merkel talked about it Tuesday. NATO members are set to meet Wednesday with Russia's ambassador to the alliance, which gathered in emergency session amid Poland's fears that any potential conflict could spread around the region. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Tuesday that despite repeated calls by the international community, ""Russia continues to violate Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and continues to violate its international commitments."" There's no indication yet NATO will intervene militarily, but its members may take action other ways. That includes actions targeting Moscow (like Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper announcing the cancellation of military activities involving his and Russia's militaries), punitive measures like sanctions against Ukrainian individuals or groups or helping prop up that nation's shaky economy. To that latter point, Ukraine's Parliament ratified a deal Tuesday to receive loans from the European Union worth 610 million euros, the equivalent of nearly $839 million. Representatives of the International Monetary Fund were headed to the country to begin inspections ahead of a possible financial deal. And U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has announced a $1 billion loan guarantee for Ukraine. Kerry visited Kiev on Tuesday, laying flowers in honor of slain protesters at Maidan, or Independence Square, and accusing Russia of making up reasons to intervene militarily. ""Not a single piece of credible evidence"" supports Russian explanations for its move into Crimea, said the top U.S. diplomat. He added, ""Russia has talked about Russian-speaking citizens being under siege. They're not."" Washington prefers a peaceful resolution to this crisis, Kerry said. But if that doesn't happen -- and Russian steps up its military involvement -- ""our partners will have absolutely no choice (but) to join us to continue to expand on steps we have taken in recent days to isolate Russia diplomatically, politically and economically."" ""The United States will stand by the Ukrainian people as they build the strong democratic country they deserve,"" Kerry said. ""... We must all step up and answer their call.""","U.S. official: Germany's leader is trying to set up an exit strategy for Russia's Putin .

"(CNN)ISIS is holding many more Assyrian Christians hostage than previously thought -- and it is reportedly planning to release a message Wednesday threatening to kill them. Osama Edward, founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network, told CNN that the extremist group is now believed to have 150 hostages, citing the latest information from the network's team on the ground. Initial estimates put the number seized at between 70 and 100 people, among them women, children and the elderly. The video message will be directed to President Barack Obama and other members of the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS, Edward said from Stockholm, Sweden. The Assyrians were kidnapped early Monday from villages near Tal Tamer in northeastern Syria. Edward, who has family in the area attacked by the terror group, said the latest information from the ground indicated the hostages had been moved to an ISIS-controlled location. The activist organization Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently also said on Twitter that ISIS has moved a number of Assyrian captives to Raqqa, which has been called the Islamist extremist group's de facto capital. The last message received from the hostages was a text from a kidnapped woman to her husband, Edward said. She said the kidnappers were interrogating the hostages about whether the women were members of local militias. Edward said he feared the hostages would face the same fate as Assyrians targeted in Iraq and the more than 20 members of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority slaughtered by ISIS in Libya last month. ""Maybe they are facing the same destiny. That's why we call on all over the world, like the U.S, Europe, coalition forces -- protect Assyrians, save Assyrians in Syria,"" he said. ""They are facing death, people are unarmed, they are peaceful. And they need help, they are just left alone -- no one's protecting them."" Edward said some 35 Assyrian villages and towns had now been taken over by ISIS, forcing thousands of families to flee. Some 600 of these families have taken refuge in St. Mary's Cathedral in al-Hasakah, Syria. After years caught up in the middle of a civil war, many of these Assyrians lack food, water, blankets and other basics. The Assyrians are a proud group that's overcome a lot in their history. They can trace their roots back some 4,000 years to the time of Mesopotamia, considered one of the cradles of civilization and birthplace of writing and literature. While their first religion was Ashurism, Assyrians have been predominantly Christian since the third century. ""How can Syria be Syria without the Assyrians?"" Edward said. ""We gave the country our name."" ISIS has proven, time and again, its willingness to ruthlessly go after minority groups who don't subscribe to its extreme, twisted take on Islam. Some of their targets -- the Assyrians included -- have taken up arms in an attempt to defend their communities, fighting alongside Kurdish militia, which have made some recent gains against ISIS in Syria's northeast. Thus, while kidnapping women and children is unacceptable by any measure, ISIS going after the Assyrian community in al-Hasakah Province may have an element of military, as well as religious, motivation. But ISIS has faced some opposition. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, members of the Kurdish YPG -- or People's Protection Units -- have taken control of 70 villages in the Syrian province. They're on the cusp of taking some inhabited by Assyrians and were clashing Wednesday with ISIS forces around Tal Tamer, the London-based monitoring group reported. Embattled civilians are also getting help from the the al-Sanadid Army and other fighters, as well as from U.S.-led coalition airstrikes. The Observatory claims that 132 ISIS militants have been killed since Saturday. Of course, this isn't the only place where ISIS has been blamed for atrocities or has encountered pushback. The militant group also holds vast swaths of territory in Iraq, including its second-largest city of Mosul. Yet Iraq's once beleaguered military has made progress of late, liberating most areas of the long besieged town of al-Baghdadi, according to the Iraqi Defense Ministry. Videos released by the ministry Tuesday showed convoys moving toward al-Baghdadi and patrolling parts of the city as well as lawmakers visiting the nearby Ayn al-Asad air base, where some 400 U.S. military personnel are stationed to train Iraqi pilots in the fight against ISIS. When contacted by CNN, an Anbar official, Faleh al-Assawi, said Iraqi security forces aided by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes had secured about 80% of al-Baghdadi. The Defense Ministry said on its website that it is working to secure the rest of the town. Elsewhere in Anbar Province, video posted online shows Iraqi security forces' discovery of tunnels presumably dug by ISIS to give them an underground route to reach a central government compound in Ramadi, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) west of Baghdad. This can all be seen as progress. Even then, they're only small steps toward eradicating a threat that, in many ways, remains as savage and dangerous as ever. CNN's Greg Botelho, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Salim Essaid, Anas Hamdan, Gul Tuysuz and Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","Group: Kurds are clashing with ISIS in town where many Assyrians were abducted .

"(CNN)Andy Murray picked up his first title of 2015 without having to so much as lift his racket after Novak Djokovic pulled out of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship final in Abu Dhabi due to illness. Djokovic comfortably defeated Stan Wawrinka 6-1 6-2 in Friday's semi-final but was overcome with a fever overnight. ""Unfortunately I am not to be able to play in the final in Abu Dhabi tonight. I've been sick today with a fever and I'm not fit to play,"" read a message from the World No 1. relayed on the MWTC Facebook page Saturday. ""I said after my match last night, the crowds here have shown their love of tennis again this year and always inspire me to play my best so I am hugely disappointed not to be able to play for them. ""I love being a part of this tournament and I'm really disappointed not be able to take my chance of winning the trophy here again. ""Congratulations to Andy, it's a shame I couldn't play him but I'm sure we will meet again soon.' Murray later picked up the trophy on court before the third place playoff between Rafael Nadal and Wawrinka. The Scot had been in fine form himself this week, overcoming Feliciano Lopez on Thursday before trouncing world No. 3 Nadal 6-2 6-0 on Friday. The result marked the first time Murray had beaten a top-four player since he triumphed in the 2013 Wimbledon final against Djokovic. A disappointing 2014 saw Murray spend much of the season on the treatment table after back surgery but a late surge saw him climb up the rankings to appear at the season ending ATP Finals in London. Both Djokovic and Murray will now ramp up their preparations for the year's first major in the shape of the Australian Open which gets underway in a little over two weeks' time. Djokovic is set to appear in the Qatar Open in Doha next week while Murray will travel to Australia to compete for Great Britain in the Hoffman Cup.","Novak Djokovic withdraws from final of Mubadala World Tennis Championship .

"When I first heard The Beatles, as a child, I thought they walked into the recording studio with a genius idea and they executed that idea perfectly. Every note, every word, every la da da dadada was planned and just had to be laid down on wax.  The recordings were perfect.  The Beatles were geniuses and that's how geniuses created works of art. I had never met anyone who created real music and I figured musicians had ideas for sounds in their heads and then performed them.  That was the job and to do it you had to be a genius. Then I bought my first bootleg record.  Stamped on the plain jacket were the words ""Kum Back"" and the record store had it filed under Beatles.   I kind of knew what I was buying.  I knew these were recordings of The Beatles that The Beatles hadn't wanted released. I was a Beatlemaniac: Remembering The Beatles' American invasion . There wasn't even shrink-wrap to unseal with my thumbnail before I put it on the turntable.  The song titles weren't listed on the label, there was just a picture of a pig and a hole in the record that wasn't even centered.  This was dirty and wrong. It turns out the bootleg of ""Kum Back"" I had was not even the real bootleg of the Glyn Johns acetate.  It was another collection of Beatles stuff misnamed to cash in on the first Beatle bootleg.  In my town we got counterfeit bootlegs. As I turned up my mom's record player loud what I heard changed my life.   I heard The Beatles making mistakes.  I heard them fumbling around to find their genius. It was mostly outtakes from ""Let it Be."" ""Let it Be"" was supposed to be funkier, dirtier, and more live sounding than ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" but my inexperienced ears didn't understand that. The released album, even with ""Dig it"" and ""One After 909"" and Phil Spector's inappropriate production was perfect to me.   Even the giggles on ""Let it Be"" had seemed planned to me.  But this bootleg had Paul singing out of tune! It had versions of the songs that were different.  It had The Beatles trying different tempos, different lyrics and different ideas.   It had The Beatles fighting.  I heard The Beatles failing.  I heard The Beatles working. Video: The Sixties: The British invasion . I still believe The Beatles started with ideas.  They had feelings in their hearts and thoughts in their minds they wanted to express.   But learning that they didn't have perfect blueprints from their genius was a revelation.  It inspired me to start to practice and rehearse the stupid ideas that I had. Armed with nothing more than the knowledge that The Beatles had to work on the records, I started learning to juggle and do magic.   It's been way more than 20 years ago today and I still haven't finished my juggling/magic Sgt. Pepper's, but I'm still working. I've met a lot of musicians, and they bang around a lot before they come up with the finished track, or the finished composition.  I've learned that writing books, essays, and magic patter is mostly editing.  No matter how clear the idea is, you have to monkey with it.   You have to work. Even Bob Dylan crosses things out and starts again.  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has his notes on display to prove that.   (Although I still believe it's possible that Dylan fabricated those mistakes after the fact just to test our faith, like some creationists believe god created confusing fossils.) In comedy Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton are often held up as two ends of the discovery/vision continuum. Lore is that Chaplin would monkey around on the set trying all sorts of things until something seemed right and Keaton supposedly showed up just to shoot the scene he already had in his head. I've always respected Keaton so much more than Chaplin -- I like the idea of having an idea -- but I'm sure there are Keaton outtakes.   Keaton didn't just risk his life and break his bones -- he also had to work.  He must have run down some dead ends. I understood the idea of work in music, comedy, movies, writing, performance, and certainly juggling and magic, but the fine arts still had that wall of genius separating pure inspiration from work. I would see studies and sketches in museums, but even those seemed perfect.  I thought the fine arts were something else, something different, a pure kind of genius. Then about five years ago my buddy, entrepreneur and inventor Tim Jenison, told me he was going to paint his version of Vermeer's ""The Music Lesson"" in his warehouse in San Antonio.  Tim reckoned that Vermeer didn't just get a perfect photorealistic image in his head and move it to the canvas with a steady handful of talent.  Tim figured that Vermeer had used a machine and a lot of hard work. Tim was going to recreate a machine like that and with no experience or talent for oil painting, Tim was going to try to do his own Vermeer. This wouldn't be just four Liverpudlians sitting around in a room with guitars, drum and a piano serving the muse.  Tim would first have to tear down the wall of his warehouse in Texas to put in windows for the proper light, build all the furniture himself to recreate Vermeer's room from the 17th Century, grind his own lenses, grind his own 17th century style pigments (many of which are illegal today because they're so poisonous), mix his own paint and after all that and more, then he could start the backbreaking and mind-numbing work of painting with his machine. It would cost him more money and man-hours than all the Beatle albums put together. I told Tim we had to document his trying to paint a Vermeer, and I convinced Teller to direct a movie that would be Tim's bootleg ""Kum Back"" to Vermeer's perfect ""Let it Be.""   I love Tim and didn't think I could respect him more than I did before he started this project. I was wrong. Tim is The Beatles. Tim is Vermeer. Tim is a genius. ""Tim's Vermeer"" didn't diminish my love, respect, enjoyment or awe of Vermeer's paintings. I still believe in genius. But, for better or worse, all geniuses have to work their asses off. There will be an answer, but you can't just let it be.","Penn Jillette: As a kid, I thought the Beatles recorded their songs without a hitch .

"(CNN)How long will the data last in your hard-drive or USB stick? Five years? 10 years? Longer? Already a storage company called Backblaze is running 25,000 hard drives simultaneously to get to the bottom of the question. As each hard drive coughs its last, the company replaces it and logs its lifespan. While this census has only been running five years, the statistics show a 22% attrition rate over four years. Some may last longer than a decade, the company says, others may last little more than a year; but the short answer is that storage devices don't last forever. Science is now looking to nature, however, to find the best way to store data in a way that will make it last for millions of years. Researchers at ETH Zurich, in Switzerland, believe the answer may lie in the data storage system that exists in every living cell: DNA. So compact and complex are its strands that just 1 gram of DNA is theoretically capable of containing all the data of internet giants such as Google and Facebook, with room to spare. In data storage terms, that gram would be capable of holding 455 exabytes, where one exabyte is equivalent to a billion gigabytes. Fossilization has been known to preserve DNA in strands long enough to gain an animal's entire genome -- the complete set of genes present in a cell or organism. So far, scientists have extracted and sequenced the genome of a 110,000-year-old polar bear and more recently a 700,000-year-old horse. Robert Grass, lecturer at the Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, said the problem with DNA is that it degrades quickly. The project, he said, wanted to find ways of combining the possibility of the large storage density in DNA with the stability of the DNA found in fossils. ""We have found elegant ways of making DNA very stable,"" he told CNN. ""So we wanted to combine these two stories -- to get the high storage density of DNA and combine it with the archaeological aspects of DNA."" The synthetic process of preserving DNA actually mimics processes found in nature. As with fossils, keeping the DNA cool, dry and encased -- in this case, with microscopic spheres of glass - could keep the information contained in its strands intact for thousands of years. ""The time limit with DNA in fossils is about 700,000 years but people speculate about finding one-million-year storage of genomic material in fossil bones,"" he said. ""We were able to show that decay of our DNA and store of information decays at the same rate as the fossil DNA so we get to similar time frames of close to a million years."" Fresh fossil discoveries are throwing up new surprises about the preservation of DNA. Human bones discovered in the Sima de los Huesos cave network in Spain show maternally inherited ""mitochondrial"" DNA that is 400,000 years old -  a new record for human remains. The fact that the DNA survived in the relatively cool climate of a cave -- rather than in a frozen environment as with the DNA extracted from mammoth remains in Siberia - has added to the mystery about DNA longevity. ""A lot of it is not really known,"" Grass says. ""What we're trying to understand is how DNA decays and what the mechanisms are to get more insight into that."" What is known is that water and oxygen are the enemy of DNA survival. DNA in a test tube and exposed to air will last little more than two to three years. Encasing it in glass -- an inert, neutral agent - and cooling it increases its chances of survival. Grass says sol-gel technology, which produces solid materials from small molecules, has made it a relatively easy process to get the glass around the DNA molecules. While the team's work invites immediate comparison with Jurassic Park, where DNA was extracted from amber fossils, Grass says that prehistoric insects encased in amber are a poor source of prehistoric DNA. ""The best DNA comes from sources that are ceramic and dry -- so teeth, bones and even eggshells,"" he said. So far the team has tested their storage method by preserving just 83 kilobytes of data. ""The first is the Swiss Federal Charter of 1291 -- it's like the Swiss Magna Carta -- and the other was the Archimedes Palimpsest; a copy of an Ancient Greek mathematics treatise made by a monk in the 10th century but which had been overwritten by other monks in the 15th century. ""We wanted to preserve these documents to show not just that the method works, but that the method is important too,"" he said. He estimates that the information will be readable in 10,000 years' time, and if frozen, as long as a million years. The cost of encoding just 83Kb of data cost about $2,000, making it a relatively expensive process, but Grass is optimistic that price will come down over time. Advances in technology for medical analysis, he said, are likely to help with this. ""Already the prices for human genome sequences have dropped from several millions of dollars a few years ago to just hundreds of dollars now,"" Grass said. ""It makes sense to integrate these advances in medical and genome analysis into the world of IT."" Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"EL COCA, Ecuador (Reuters)  -- Under pressure to preserve the environment while at the same time ease the poverty of his people, Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa has come up with an unusual solution. President Rafael Correa has startled Wall Street with talk of not paying Ecuador's $10.3 billion foreign debt. Correa wants wealthy nations to pay Ecuador $350 million a year in exchange for leaving an estimated 1 billion barrels of oil under the ground in the pristine Yasuni rain forest. ""I think oil has brought us more bad than good,"" said Correa during a recent visit to the bustling Amazonian oil town of El Coca. ""We need to do something about it."" Environmentalists around the world have celebrated the idea, apparently the first of its kind, as a way to preserve a delicate environment without creating an economic burden for the cash-strapped nation where six in 10 people are poor. The move come amid growing popularity of ""carbon offsetting,"" in which first-world residents concerned about climate change make donations to compensate for the environmental damage their consumer habits cause. But critics wonder if the politically unstable Ecuador, which relies on oil for nearly half of its export revenues, can keep this promise to the international community or whether authorities are trying to have their cake and eat it, too. The plan involves creating a trust fund for donations or accepting debt pardons from other countries or multilateral lenders such as the International Monetary Fund. The $350 million would constitute about half the annual revenues Ecuador thinks it could make from extracting oil from the field, partly located inside the 2.4 million-acre (982,000-hectare) Yasuni National Park. Former energy minister Alberto Acosta has pointed out that all the oil in the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini field would only be enough for 12 days of global crude consumption. Government officials say Norway, a group of Italian lawmakers and even one undisclosed oil company have inquired about the plan. ""It sounds ridiculous, but when you compare that money with Ecuador's foreign debt it's actually a small quantity,"" said Matt Finer a scientist with U.S.-based environmental coalition Save America's Forests. ""Rich nations have to chip in."" The Yasuni is home to species ranging from endangered white-bellied spider monkeys to rare jaguars that live alongside indigenous groups that live isolated from the outside world and still hunt with spears and blowguns. Correa, a close ally of Venezuelan leftist President Hugo Chavez, has startled Wall Street by threatening not to pay Ecuador's $10.3 billion foreign debt. He is embroiled in a power struggle with Congress and opposition lawmakers who say he is scaring off oil investment. He also openly backs a $6 billion lawsuit filed by indigenous groups who accuse U.S.-based Chevron of polluting a large swath of the Ecuadorean Amazon. The proposal's detractors say Ecuador cannot ensure the park's sanctity given political turmoil that has at times halted oil operations and has made Correa the eighth president in 10 years. ""Correa is asking the international community to dive in to see if there is water in the pool,"" said Daniel Erikson, an analyst with the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. Correa has said Ecuador will begin oil development next year if the government cannot secure the funds by then. Even if Ecuador can promise to halt the contamination of multinational oil behemoths, it may struggle to control an equally serious contamination threat to Yasuni -- migrants already setting up farms and shantytown dwellings there. But supporters of Correa's idea say the best way to limit the migration to the park is to ensure there are no oil-field jobs to draw them there. ""Oh God, what I wouldn't do to halt oil development,"" said Alonso Jaramillo, chief of eight rangers that watch over the park, roughly the size of Vermont. ""I shake every time I hear about new oil development in my park."" E-mail to a friend .","Ecuador leader touts plan to leave estimated 1 billion barrels of oil under ground .

"Hong Kong (CNN)It was the most-watched TV show in the world -- and it was a sexist mess. That's what Chinese activists are saying in a petition issued this week that calls for the cancellation of China's annual Lunar New Year Gala, a state TV extravaganza viewed last Wednesday by 690 million people -- but filled with grating skits mocking women and other minority groups. One sketch depicted an overweight woman in her late-20s complaining about being unmarried. The punchline? Her brothers bring out a tall, slim female ""goddess"" to help their less attractive sister understand why she's still single. ""I've got big eyes, small mouth, a high nose, long legs... I'm pretty and a bunch of guys are chasing me that give me 'face',"" chants the taller woman. ""I don't have breasts and a bunch of guys are chasing me to do arm wrestling,"" replies the shorter one. Then, in unison, the duo cheerfully exclaim their respective identities: ""Female goddess and manly woman!"" In another act, a father jokes about selling his daughter for 30 yuan ($4.80). Another skit mocks a ""female cadre,"" implying that she's used sexual favors to advance her career. Other parts of the show rag on southern Chinese people as well as dwarfs. In a society where women still face significant challenges — from discrimination against girls to extreme pressure on women to marry early -- many watchers found the performance nauseating. A widely-circulated petition called the show ""poisonous"" and demanded it to be taken off air. ""In the name of 'harmony' it erases the rights of people to live differently. It complacently slanders not just women... but all people, as long as you are eager to think critically and make decisions out of your free will,"" it said. The petition racked up thousands of signatures, many of them by self-described feminists, before it was removed from the Internet. (CNN was able to access a cached version.) But some posts by feminists remained uncensored on Weibo, China's public social media platform. ""Comparing 'manly women' and 'goddesses,' unmarried and unemployed women... what qualifications do you have to discuss these topics?"" one highly-rated comment fumed at the show's producers. ""Why don't you discuss male losers? The fact that these skits were shown on the Gala is truly a national humiliation."" The same writer added: ""We're not proposing that women rule over everything. We just want awareness of how women are discriminated against everywhere, and we want change."" CNN's Serena Dong contributed reporting.","Comedy skit in China's Lunar New Year Gala TV show mocked overweight, unmarried women .

"(CNN)These are not your older brother's Power Rangers. Yeah, there are some helmeted costumes and martial arts in ""Power/Rangers,"" the 14-minute short inspired by the 1990s children's TV series. But there are also some grim postapocalyptic settings, terse dialogue and violence. Lots and lots of bloody, graphic violence. The ""bootleg,"" in producer Adi Shankar's term, is the product of a thought experiment: How would fighting an intergalactic war really affect some high schoolers? (In the original candy-colored show -- which reused some campy Japanese programming -- a group of teens gets drafted to battle aliens.) ""How is that any different from child soldiers, man? That's super f***ed-up,"" Shankar, the producer of ""The Grey"" and ""Dredd,"" says in an accompanying video. ""They're going to have PTSD, and they're going have the most f***ed-up lives."" Hence, ""Power/Rangers,"" which has been buzzed about all over the Internet. The less-violent version has picked up more than 6 million YouTube views in less than two days; the NSFW version has just slightly fewer. The video stars James Van Der Beek and Katee Sackhoff. Director Joseph Kahn, known as a music video powerhouse (Taylor Swift's ""Blank Space,"" Britney Spears' ""Toxic""), told HitFix that he was unfamiliar with the nuts and bolts of the Power Rangers universe but liked the challenge. ""The trick that I really wanted to do with this was to make that dark and gritty version that everybody keeps talking about, but really do it,"" he said. ""Really see if I could totally accomplish it with essentially a really incredible incredibly silly property."" The Internet was gobsmacked, of course. ""Holy Hell This 'Power Rangers' Reboot Is Dark As F*ck,"" headlined Io9.com. But the video may be in for a legal battle. According to Kahn, the producer of the other ""Power Rangers,"" Haim Saban, is ""trying to shut 'Power/Rangers' down."" A new theatrical film version is scheduled for 2016. Vimeo took down the NSFW video Tuesday, and Deadline Hollywood reported that it was at the behest of a copyright infringement claim. Kahn has fought back on Twitter. ""Every image in 'Power/Rangers' is original footage,"" he posted in a series of tweets. ""Nothing was pre-existing. There is no copyrighted footage in the short. I am not making any money on it and I refuse to accept any from anyone. It was not even kickstarted, I paid for it myself.""","""Power/Rangers,"" rethinking of 1990s show, is a huge online hit .

"(CNN)Julia and I were all ready to have our first bike ride. We had a baby sitter for our daughter Mara and we were really making it happen -- no more talk. It would be a real 100% couples' bike ride. Our first ride as a married couple, with our own bikes. I was convinced that with my new Specialized bike it would be a cake walk to do this, and wouldn't be a struggle at all. The day was beautiful -- not a cloud in the sky. I felt as if I were an expert bike rider, from my school days; however, that was a long time ago. I was in for a surprise. I had never been clipped into a bike before. Also, I never had a bike before that did not have a kick stand. This was no ordinary Huffy. Being clipped in full gear, I was ready to do this, or so I thought. I clipped in and was on the bike for an entire 20 seconds. This was easy. I had this down, I thought to myself. Then, I tried to stop and get off. It didn't work. I panicked, because I could not get my feet off. It all seemed to happen in vivid slow motion. I crashed and I could not do anything to stop it. I went down like the Titanic, and it was an ugly sight. It was also a real crushing blow to my athlete's ego. So, I started asking myself all of these questions in this blink of any eye as I laid on the ground with my new bike, where I was now stuck like a beached whale. How could I fall so quickly? Why could I not get my feet off the pedals? Was I too old and out of shape to really do this Fit Nation challenge? And perhaps more importantly, are people who do triathlons absolutely nuts? In a matter of one minute, I doubted every athletic ability I once was so confident about. Just like that. To succeed, I knew that I had to mentally slap myself and tell myself, 'Hey, you can do this.' It was only at that very moment that I realized, this was my own journey against myself. I kicked my feet out of the pedals, picked up the bike and rode for around 10 miles with no more falls for the day. I think I learned an important lesson, crashing 20 seconds into my first ride. Conquering a Triathlon, is not going to be without failure and falling down. It's about getting up, and not giving up. It's about listening and becoming connected to your body, and realizing that training for a triathlon is a spiritual journey as well as physical one. I may have crashed on my bike faster than anyone in the entire history of Fit Nation, but the lesson I learned in the process was well worth it. If and when you go down on the bike, you have to pick yourself up, and get it together. YOU TOTALLY GOT THIS!!!","Julia and Eugene Smookler are Fit Nation's first team couple .

"(CNN)There's been plenty of talk of late -- welcome discussion, in my humble opinion -- about equal pay for equal work. Patricia Arquette sparked an online conversation and debate with her call for pay equality after accepting the award for best supporting actress at this year's Oscars. And, this month, the embattled and now ex-co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures, Amy Pascal, whipped up another firestorm by putting the onus on women. If women want to eliminate pay disparities in Hollywood, they need to demand more money. ""What women have to do is not work for less money,"" she said, according to CNN Money. ""They have to walk away."" That is certainly easier said than done for most women in America, who can't afford to turn their backs on their jobs when they are helping to support families or doing it all on their own. But there is something all women can do no matter their income level or background -- and it's something that could dramatically alter the course of their lives, according to bestselling new book ""The Woman Code."" Author Sophia Nelson -- a motivational speaker, lawyer and former White House reporter who has more energy pulsing from her petite frame than most of us could ever imagine -- says that before any woman can push for a raise or a promotion, she's got to put her attention on one and only one person: herself. ""You've got to love you,"" Nelson said during a recent visit to CNN's studios. ""You've got to like you, and so many of us in the 21st century do not as women like and value ourselves."" It may sound too simplistic to you or more psychobabble than actionable advice, but think about it. Why have books like ""The Confidence Code,"" about how women lack the same confidence as men, struck such a chord; or ads such as #LikeAGirl, about how our girls lose confidence post-puberty, gone viral and been prominently featured during the Super Bowl? For a host of reasons, many women grow up not truly appreciating what we can do and what we can be, says Nelson, whose book is broken down into 20 codes or keys that can help women ""unlock"" their true potential. Code No. 1, she says, is for women to know their own value, and we're talking value beyond what they earn or believe they should earn. Tip No. 1: Your past does not define you . ""So many women are defined by hurts that happened to them, the family they grew up in,"" said Nelson, ""and they never really move past the definitions that their families gave them."" We've got these tapes that we play in our heads, she says. So, if you were constantly told supportive things, such as ""you can do anything,"" which I heard at home and at school, that can push you to overcome challenges. If you were repeatedly told negative things, such as ""you are too shy, not ambitious enough, not good enough,"" those words can stay with you -- but only if you let them, says Nelson, who frequently appears on television and radio as a political and cultural commentator. ""If you were given negative tapes, you have to make peace with that,"" she said. ""And you have to decide I'm not going to be defined by that. I'm going to be the definer of me. And that's what I really want women to get out of this. Everything you need to win at life is inside of you. It's already there. Greatness is there, so it doesn't matter how you start. It matters how you finish."" Love. That. Quote. Tip No. 2: Teach people how to treat you . Another key to knowing your value, says Nelson, is teaching people how to treat you. ""If you don't speak up for yourself, no one else ever will,"" she said. ""That code was hard for me because when somebody does something not nice to us ... we're thinking, 'Well, they're a jerk,' but guess what? If you didn't raise your voice, if you didn't say that wasn't acceptable, people are going to treat you any old way."" Good advice, but not the easiest to execute, I said, especially when women who speak up are too often called the b-word or receive the ""Who does she think she is?"" reaction. ""That's exactly true,"" said Nelson. ""However, if we want to shift it for your daughter, my nieces, the younger women coming up, then that means we have to do a culture shift. And part of living by a code and knowing your value and teaching people how to treat you is you establish a boundary. ""You are not a 'B' because you say 'that wasn't polite' or 'I didn't like it'; you are asserting yourself. Men do it all the time. And I think when we teach our sons and our nephews and the men in our lives that it's OK for us to assert ourselves ... we're being a human being. We are saying what we don't like. We have to make it OK for women and girls to speak up."" Tip No. 3: Being accountable for yourself . We are too often taught to put everyone else before us, says Nelson: kids, husband, partner, job, you name it. I, for one, am guilty of that, and I bet many of you reading this are in the same category. But we end up not only hurting ourselves by this approach; we hurt everything around us as well. ""When you are accountable for you, you say if I'm a happy me, if I'm making good choices, if I'm taking care of me, everybody else is going to benefit from that."" Tip No. 4: Guarding your heart . Being accountable for you and taking care of your needs doesn't mean you become your own island. It means you find a way to put your priorities near the top of the list. It also means you guard your own heart, says Nelson. ""Guarding your heart doesn't mean gating your heart,"" she said. ""It means when you get hurt, you're resilient. You get back up. You love again. It means you choose the right people, not the wrong people. And when you come across the wrong people, you honor you and say, 'Now, wait a minute.' "" It means letting go of the toxic personal and professional relationships and knowing when it's time to move on from a job, make a career change or choose a new personal path. ""Everything you need to win is inside you. You just got to push it out."" I don't really believe in New Year's resolutions but I did start 2015 with a motto: Let's do this thing. It means seize the moment, go for what you want, take chances, take risks. I was reminded of that as I read ""The Woman Code."" Let's do this thing, women. Let's do it now.

"Miami (CNN)Two South Florida law enforcement officers are under fire after witnesses used their cell phones to capture footage of them possibly mistreating arrestees. The first video, recorded Sunday afternoon, shows Fort Lauderdale police officer Victor Ramirez escorting Bruce Laclair, who CNN affiliate WSVN reports is homeless, at a bus terminal. According to the arrest report, Ramirez, who was working an off-duty detail at the time, saw the man sleeping on a bench and asked him to wake up and go somewhere else. The man cursed at Ramirez and told the officer to leave him alone, the report says. Ramirez wrote in the report that he told Laclair to leave the terminal and gave him plenty of time to leave. ""After ignoring me, I grabbed Laclair and arrested him for trespassing after warning,"" the report says. Video shows the nine-year veteran of the Fort Lauderdale Police Department shoving the 58-year-old man to the ground. The two argue for a few seconds and, after telling the man to ""get up"" multiple times, Ramirez reaches for Laclair's arm. Laclair pulls away, and Ramirez slaps the man in the face as he's still sitting on the ground. ""I'm not f***ing around with you. Don't f***ing touch me,"" Ramirez tells the man before handcuffing him. Ramirez is on paid leave while an investigation is underway, police say. Reached by telephone, Ramirez declined to comment on the video. ""The video is concerning,"" Fort Lauderdale police Capt. Francis Sousa said. ""We realize what the perception of the video (is). However, we ask that the public be patient and allow the process to play itself out. The Broward County State Attorney's Office is going to investigate this first, and upon completion of that, we'll conduct our own thorough and unbiased investigation."" The man in the video has pleaded no contest to the charge. After his court appearance Monday, he told WSVN he did not know what happened. ""I'm pissed off,"" he said. ""Most of the police officers around here are very reasonable, good people who just have a job to do. This guy, I don't know what his problem is."" The second video, shot Monday by attorney Bill Gelin at the Broward County Courthouse, shows Broward Sheriff's Deputy Christopher Johnson dragging a handcuffed, screaming woman down a hallway by her leg restraints. The 28-year-old inmate, whom CNN is not identifying, is mentally ill, according to WSVN, and she was at the courthouse for a probation violation involving criminal mischief and trespassing. When she was told she was not allowed to say goodbye to her mother, she was taken to the hallway and told to sit on a bench, which she refused to do, WSVN reported. Johnson said he witnessed the woman being ""loud, disrespectful and uncooperative"" toward a judge, and when she attempted to leave the jury box area, he ""tried to physically impede her"" until the proceedings were complete, according to the officer's narrative. After she cursed at Johnson while trying to leave the courtroom, Johnson wrote in his narrative, ""I immediately pulled her out of the courtroom, by her waist-chain."" She pulled herself from his grasp and tried to sit in a public area, so after giving her several commands and ""fearing she would cause a commotion in the public area, I then physically grabbed (her) by her leg (restraints),"" the officer's narrative said. As Johnson drags her by her ankle restraints, the woman, whose shirt rides up her torso, cries and tells the deputy, ""You're hurting me,"" the video shows. She clutches onto a sign as he attempts to pull her through a doorway. ""It reminded me of the Wild West when they would rope these guys and drag them from a horse by their feet -- but this was actually metal shackles,"" Gelin said. ""When I first came out I didn't know if this woman had attacked somebody or needed to be on the ground like that, but I'm telling you, within seconds, it became apparent that she was just completely and totally mentally ill, and this is not how you do things in 2015."" He likened her treatment to ""torture."" Gelin's wife, Lynn DeSanti, the chief assistant public defender in charge of the division that represents the dragged woman, saw the whole incident and called the deputy's behavior ""a huge disgrace."" ""She wasn't just dragged a couple feet. She was dragged throughout most of the third floor of the courthouse, and it was not necessary and it was really just egregious conduct,"" she said. ""To treat one of the most fragile, vulnerable people in society that way, there was no reason for it."" The woman, who has been in jail since December 30 on a probation violation, had gone before a judge for a competency hearing prior to the dragging incident, DeSanti said. She's been examined again since the incident, she said. ""We've had two doctors that have evaluated her and, in their opinion, she is not competent to proceed, meaning that her mental health is so fragile that she can't go forward with the charges right now,"" DeSanti said. ""It was disturbing, to say the least,"" Gelin told CNN. ""This is somebody who was obviously mentally ill and it was like torture. How can you do this to another human being, particularly one who's mentally ill?"" Johnson is on restricted duty pending the outcome of an investigation. ""I am concerned by the way the deputy handled this situation because there were other courses of action he could have taken,"" Broward County Sheriff Steve Israel said. ""Internal Affairs has initiated a complete and comprehensive investigation."" CNN's Javier de Diego and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","One video shows a Fort Lauderdale officer slapping a homeless man during arrest .

"Africa's western black rhino is now officially extinct according the latest review of animals and plants by the world's largest conservation network. The subspecies of the black rhino -- which is classified as ""critically endangered"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species -- was last seen in western Africa in 2006. The IUCN warns that other rhinos could follow saying Africa's northern white rhino is ""teetering on the brink of extinction"" while Asia's Javan rhino is ""making its last stand"" due to continued poaching and lack of conservation. Rhino horn trade triggers extinction threat . ""In the case of the western black rhino and the northern white rhino the situation could have had very different results if the suggested conservation measures had been implemented,"" Simon Stuart, chair of the IUCN species survival commission said in a statement. ""These measures must be strengthened now, specifically managing habitats in order to improve performance, preventing other rhinos from fading into extinction,"" Stuart added. The IUCN points to conservation efforts which have paid off for the southern white rhino subspecies which have seen populations rise from less than 100 at the end of the 19th century to an estimated wild population of 20,000 today. Where animals go before extinction . Another success can be seen with the Przewalski's Horse which was listed as ""extinct in the wild"" in 1996 but now, thanks to a captive breeding program, has an estimated population of 300. The latest update to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species reviews more than 60,000 species, concluding that 25% of mammals on the list are at risk of extinction. Many plants are also under threat, say the IUCN. Populations of Chinese fir, a conifer which was once widespread throughout China and Vietnam, is being threatened by the expansion of intensive agriculture according to the IUCN. A type of yew tree (taxus contorta) found in Asia which is used to produce Taxol (a chemotherapy drug) has been reclassified from ""vulnerable"" to ""endangered"" on the IUCN Red List, as has the Coco de Mer -- a palm tree found in the Seychelles islands -- which is at risk from fires and illegal harvesting of its kernels. Recent studies of 79 tropical plants in the Indian Ocean archipelago revealed that more than three quarters of them were at risk of extinction. In the oceans, the IUCN reports that five out of eight tuna species are now ""threatened"" or ""near threatened,"" while 26 recently-discovered amphibians have been added to the Red List including the ""blessed poison frog"" (classified as vulnerable) while the ""summers' poison frog"" is endangered. ""This update offers both good and bad news on the status of many species around the world,"" Jane Smart, director of IUCN's global species program said in a statement. ""We have the knowledge that conservation works if executed in a timely manner, yet, without strong political will in combination with targeted efforts and resources, the wonders of nature and the services it provides can be lost forever.""","Subspecies of black rhino in Africa extinct according to leading conservation network .

"Nigerian forces battling the Islamist terror group Boko Haram have killed a man suspected of acting as the group's leader, Nigeria's Defense Ministry said. The soldiers and Boko Haram militants clashed several times in the past week in communities around the city of Maiduguri in the country's northeastern Borno state, the ministry's statement said. ""In the course of those encounters, one Mohammed Bashir who has been acting or posing on videos as the deceased Abubakar Shekau, the eccentric character known as leader of the group, died,"" it said. ""Since the name Shekau has become a brand name for the terrorists' leader, the Nigerian military remains resolute to serve justice to anyone who assumes that designation or title."" The Nigerian military has touted Shekau's death several times, only to retract its claim after he appeared alive and well in propaganda videos. Several other Boko Haram fighters also died in the latest fighting, the Defense Ministry said, and a number were captured along with their equipment. Another 135 militants also surrendered to Nigerian troops in the Biu area, southwest of Maiduguri, it said. Jonathan: Destructive effects . Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan told a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that Boko Haram shared a common agenda with other terror groups such as ISIS and al Qaeda -- that being ""to unleash terror, mayhem, destruction, and instability around the world"" -- but that Nigeria was working hard to root out the group. ""Nigeria knows too well the destructive effects of terrorist activities,"" he said. ""Over the past five years, we have been, and are still confronting threats posed by Boko Haram to peace and stability predominantly in the North Eastern part of our country. ""The costs are high: over 13,000 people have been killed, whole communities razed, and hundreds of persons kidnapped, the most prominent being the mindless kidnap of our innocent daughters from Chibok Secondary School, in North East Nigeria."" The terrorist group abducted an estimated 276 girls in April from the boarding school in Chibok. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 are still missing. Nigerian government officials and the International Committee of the Red Cross have had talks with Boko Haram about swapping imprisoned members of the Islamist terrorist group for the girls, a source involved in the negotiations told CNN last week, but hurdles remain. Show of defiance . Boko Haram was born 12 years ago, led by a charismatic cleric named Mohammed Yusuf who was pushing for a pure Islamic state. Yusuf was killed by police in 2009, with Abubakar Shekau taking over the group. In recent years, its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government. Much of this violence has been in Yobe, Kano, Bauchi, Borno and Kaduna states in the country's north and east, though the national capital, Abuja, has also been hit. The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The militant group is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa.","Defense Ministry: Troops have killed a man who's been acting as leader of Boko Haram .

"Eccentric basketball star Dennis Rodman's bizarre outburst about an American citizen jailed in North Korea has drawn widespread criticism, including from the prisoner's family. Rodman is in North Korea with other former NBA players for a basketball game against a local team that's due to take place Wednesday, the birthday of the country's leader Kim Jong Un. Rodman, 52, who visited North Korea three times previously in the past year, describes Kim as a beloved friend. During an exclusive interview from Pyongyang on Tuesday, he reacted angrily to a question from Chris Cuomo of CNN's ""New Day"" about whether he was planning to ask North Korean leaders about Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen who was sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp by North Korea last year on charges he intended to topple the government. Rodman suggested that Bae, a Korean-American whose health has deteriorated during his imprisonment, had done something wrong, but did not specify what. ""Do you understand what he did in this country?"" Rodman asked Cuomo. ""No, no, no, you tell me, you tell me. Why is he held captive here in this country, why?"" ""I would love to speak on this,"" Rodman said, before abruptly switching topic to talk about how his fellow basketball players had left their families behind to come to North Korea for the exhibition game. When celebrity meets brutality . Prisoner's family 'appalled' Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told Anderson Cooper 360 that Rodman's comments were shocking and outrageous. Bae, a married father of three, has suffered a series of health problems during his detention and has been transferred from the labor camp to a hospital. His mother, Myunghee Bae, who visited in October, told CNN that her son was a devout Christian who had not understood the system in North Korea. North Korea is officially an atheist state and has said religious activities were among Bae's offenses. Kenneth Bae's mother tells of heartbreak . Chung said Tuesday she was upset because Rodman didn't use his relationship with Kim to help gain her brother's release from the hospital. ""He was in a position to do some good and to help advocate for Kenneth,"" she said.  ""He refused to do so. But then instead he has chosen to hurl these outrageous accusations against Kenneth. He clearly doesn't know anything about Kenneth, about his case. And so we were appalled by that."" She said her brother was in North Korea legally working as a tour operator when he was arrested in November 2012. She said she hoped one of the former basketball players would take a chance to ask for amnesty for him. ""This isn't some game. This is about a person's life,"" she said. Rodman 'crossed a line' Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, also criticized Rodman's comments, telling CNN he was ""disappointed"" by the former NBA star's performance. ""I think Dennis Rodman crossed a line this morning by implying that Kenneth Bae might be guilty, by suggesting that there was a crime,"" said Richardson, who worked to secure the release of an American held in North Korea in 1996. ""There is no crime. Kenneth Bae is an American detainee that's been there a year in bad health, who deserves to come home."" Richardson, a former New Mexico governor who has visited North Korea multiple times, said Rodman ""drank a little bit too much of the Kool-Aid from the North Koreans."" Rodman's comments Tuesday contrast with a request he made on Twitter in May for Kim to ""do me a solid and cut Kenneth Bae loose."" Rodman struck up a friendship with Kim last February, when he first traveled to North Korea with a team of Harlem Globetrotters for an exhibition game that was watched by Kim, who is a basketball fan. He has described his series of trips to North Korea as a ""basketball diplomacy"" project. But U.S. government officials have said that they have nothing to do with the visits and that attention should be focused on the brutality of Kim's regime. White House spokesman Jay Carney noted that Rodman is on a private trip and that the United States has called for North Korea to release Bae. ""Our views about Kenneth Bae have not changed,"" he said. ""I did not see some of the comments that Mr. Rodman made, but I am not going to dignify that outburst with a response,"" Carney added. ""I am simply going to say that we remain gravely concerned about Kenneth Bae's health and continue to urge the DPRK authorities to grant his amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds."" Bae from North Korean prison: Please help me . 'I love my friend' In the interview with Cuomo, Rodman defended the visit to North Korea, saying it was a ""great idea for the world."" He became upset when pressed on whether he and the other players should have traveled there, given recent events in the secretive country. The trip takes place weeks after North Korea announced the purge and execution of leader Kim's once-powerful uncle, Jang Song Thaek. ""I love my friend,"" Rodman said in a reference to Kim. ""This is my friend."" He praised his companions' willingness to visit North Korea. ""You know, you've got 10 guys here, 10 guys here, that have left their families, they've left their damn families, to help this country in a sports venture. That's 10 guys, all these guys here, do anyone understand that?"" ""We do,"" responded Cuomo. ""And we appreciate that and we wish them well with cultural exchange."" ""No, no, no, no,""  Rodman continued. ""I don't give a rat's ass what the hell you think. I'm saying to you, look at these guys here, look at them ... they dared to do one thing, they came here."" Ready for 'the abuse' After Rodman's outburst, fellow player Charles D. Smith tried to calm the discussion, but Rodman carried on. ""You're the guy behind the mic right now,"" he told Cuomo. ""We're the guys here doing one thing. We have to go back to America and take the abuse. Do you have to take the abuse? Well, we're going to take it."" Rodman predicted his efforts and those of his fellow athletes would eventually ""open the door"" to North Korean. Smith pointed out that the group comprised not only ex-players, but some 40 other people, including a number of other Americans. Smith defended Rodman, saying the players' visit was about basketball, not politics. ""We just hope the results are positive, and we think that they'll be positive,"" he said, noting that the Americans had interacted earlier in the day with their North Korean counterparts, talking through an interpreter. North Korea had invited the American players as a kind of ""cultural exchange"" and to ""put smiles on people's faces,"" not to influence the country's leaders, Smith said. ""We are here because it's about doing great will around the world,"" he said. 'We're not ambassadors' Smith outlined the charity projects he has been involved in worldwide through his sport, including visiting typhoon victims in Asia. ""We're doing what we do, we play basketball and that's what we love to do,"" Smith said. ""We did not know that it was going to take this type of a negative spin on what we were doing because we're not politicians, we're not ambassadors. We're here to do what we've been doing most of our lives."" Smith apologized for ""the storm that has been created by our presence."" But, he added, ""We're not apologizing for doing what we do ... we're connecting people to basketball and people to people."" He cautioned against ""playing semantics"" when discussing Rodman's use of the word ""friend"" in describing his relationship with Kim. ""It's an associate,"" he said. ""You met someone once, and it's your friend ... you can't meet someone once or twice and take that enduring step."" Smith added that the players were interested only in using basketball as a bridge to cultural exchange. ""None of these guys are here to talk any sense into any politician,"" he said. Darren Prince, Rodman's agent for 16 years, told CNN on Sunday that Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson, Vin Baker, Craig Hodges, Doug Christie and Smith would play against the North Korean senior national team. NBA unimpressed . The NBA distanced itself Tuesday from Rodman. ""Dennis will be Dennis, but I think there is a lot at stake here in terms of a  ... a very dangerous country,"" outgoing NBA Commissioner David Stern said on The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer. Stern, commissioner for nearly 30 years, said the league has had preliminary discussions in the past with Pyongyang about a cultural exchange but he wouldn't send any players to North Korea without the OK of the White House. Stern said he believed that these former players agreed to the game for a big payday and didn't think about the political ramifications. He said that the league didn't sanction the trip or collaborate with Rodman's group. ""Sports diplomacy is a wonderful thing,"" he said, mentioning that the NBA has hosted teams from China and Iran. ""But they should be done in a far more dignified fashion than this particular trip is being carried out."" Rodman, NBA old-timers arrive in North Korea .

"(CNN)For a long time, rats have taken the heat for the waves of plague that killed millions of people across Europe starting in the 14th century. But now suspicion is falling on another rodent with a much cuddlier reputation: the gerbil. A team of scientists from Norway and Switzerland are challenging the widely held view that communities of rats in Europe played host to the fleas carrying the disease for hundreds of years. In an article published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers say they think the plague bacteria could have sprung from populations of the great gerbil and other rodent species in Central Asia. ""If we're right, we'll have to rewrite that part of history,"" Professor Nils Christian Stenseth of the University of Oslo, one of the authors of the study, told the BBC. The scientists investigated Europe's second plague pandemic, which began with the infamous Black Death from 1347 to 1353 and continued on and off for four centuries. They say pinning the blame solely on rats doesn't make sense. Rats weren't found in large areas of northern Europe during the period, and the peaks of the plague outbreaks don't correspond well with the climate conditions that suit rapid spreading of the disease by rat fleas. Instead, by analyzing climate data gleaned from tree rings, they found clues that suggest the plague might have repeatedly been carried back into Europe from outbreaks among rodents in Central Asia. ""We show that wherever there were good conditions for gerbils and fleas in Central Asia, some years later the bacteria shows up in harbor cities in Europe and then spreads across the continent,"" Stenseth told the BBC. The scientists say they think it's possible the plague was reintroduced each time by the trading networks of the era. Caravans of traders and their camels that traveled through infested areas in Central Asia could have picked up the disease and sent it along trade routes reaching into Europe. To determine whether they're right, the researchers plan to analyze ancient plague DNA taken from victims of the pandemic. But if rats are hoping the scientists' theory will get them off the hook entirely, they should think again. The study says they could still have played a part in the spread of plague by ships. And for people suddenly worried about their pet gerbil, there's no cause for alarm. ""If you get your gerbil at a pet store ... you have nothing to worry about,"" Ken Gage, a plague expert for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NPR.","Rats have long been blamed for helping spread the plague in Europe .
But scientists say gerbils in Central Asia could have played a bigger role .
They think the disease may have been repeatedly reintroduced through trade routes ."
"London (CNN)An out-of-this-world collection of vintage NASA photos -- including the first ""selfie"" taken in space and a rare image of pioneering astronaut Neil Armstrong on the Moon -- are to go up for sale in London. The treasure trove of more than 600 images, including some of the most significant moments in lunar exploration, was put together over decades by a dedicated collector. The pictures will go under the hammer at Bloomsbury Auctions in London on February 26, where they are expected to sell for between £300 ($465) and £10,000 ($15,525) -- a total of upwards of £500,000. Among the highlights of the sale is a photograph snapped by Buzz Aldrin -- later the second man to step onto the Moon -- during the Gemini 12 mission in November 1966, which is believed to be the first space ""selfie."" It is tipped to sell for £600 to £800 ($932 to $1,242). Aldrin also features in perhaps the most famous image in the sale: the so-called ""visor photograph"" showing him on the Moon on July 20,1969 during the Apollo 11 mission. A spokesman for Bloomsbury Auctions said the picture, taken by Armstrong just minutes after he had made his ""one small step"" speech and featuring the pioneering astronaut reflected in his colleague's helmet visor, was likely to excite a lot of interest from bidders. ""A picture like that still has enormous power today,"" the photography expert said. There's also an extremely rare picture taken by Aldrin showing his fellow explorer Armstrong on the lunar surface. Most of the photos from the Apollo 11 landing were taken by Armstrong himself, so there are very few of him actually on the Moon. ""It is very rare to find a vintage print of that because it wasn't recognized by NASA at the time,"" explained the Bloomsbury Auctions spokesman. ""They didn't realize it was Neil Armstrong, so they didn't release it to the press. It was found years later, and very few people have seen it, it hasn't been widely published, so that one is of obvious historic significance."" But the collection is not limited to photos from the 1960s heyday of the space program. The oldest image in the sale is one dating all the way back to 1946; shot by a camera strapped to a V-2 rocket, it is the first to show the earth from space. In addition to photos of astronauts, there are also landmark mosaics and panoramas showing the lunar surface, and shots looking back at Earth from the darkness of space, including the iconic ""Earthrise"" image taken by Apollo 8's William Anders in December 1968, which Sara Wheeler, head of photographs at Bloomsbury Auctions, said ""changed man's relationship with the cosmos forever."" The auction house spokesman said previous sales of NASA images had proved hugely popular, both with space enthusiasts and photography aficionados. ""Four years ago in 2011 we sold a private collection of NASA photos and I was surprised by the range of people who did buy them -- I'd say about half were interested in the aesthetics of the image, and the other half were looking for the significant moments in space history -- the classic images: the first 'earthrise', the first picture of the whole earth and so on."" He said the fact that the pictures were vintage prints, dating back to the days of the space race only added to their allure. ""They represent a golden age in the history of photography, when a few men went to the unknown to bring back awe-inspiring pictures,"" said Wheeler. The From the Earth to the Moon: Vintage NASA photographs sale takes place at Bloomsbury Auctions in London on Thursday February 26.","Treasure trove of more than 600 NASA images from the space race are up for sale at auction in London.

"Washington  (CNN)A U.S. State Department official has been arrested on suspicion of soliciting sex from a minor. Daniel Rosen was arrested Tuesday at his Washington DC home, police in Fairfax County, Virginia, said. Authorities say Rosen had been communicating online with a female detective from the county's child exploitation unit. The officer had been posing as a minor. When the detective arrived at Rosen's home, he was arrested. Police said the State Department was notified after the arrest. Rosen was taken to a Washington jail and will be extradited to Fairfax County. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said she is aware of the case but did not identify the arrested. ""For issues related to Department personnel and for privacy reasons, we are not able to confirm the identity of the individual or specific charges,"" Psaki said.

"Washington The shooting death of a former Navy SEAL, who spent his post-military career advocating for veterans suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, highlights long-standing differences over gun rights and mental health. Chris Kyle, the author of the best-selling ""American Sniper,"" and Chad Littlefield, 35, Kyle's friend, were gunned down on Saturday while shooting for fun at a Texas gun range, law enforcement officials said. Eddie Ray Routh, 25, a former Marine who told police last year he was suffering from post traumatic stress, was held on a capital murder warrant, authorities said. Shay Isham, a lawyer appointed to represent him, said his client spent roughly the past two years in and out in Veteran Affairs medical facilities for treatment of mental issues. Authorities said Kyle, 38, often took veterans with post traumatic stress to the gun range as a way of bonding with and mentoring them. Erath County Sheriff Tommy Bryant said Routh served in the Marines for four years, but it was unclear how much of that time, if any, was spent in combat zones. Kyle and LIttlefield, friends and associates, arrived with Routh at the sprawling range southwest of Fort Worth together, police said. The suspect was ""a troubled veteran whom they were trying to help,"" said Craft International, a company founded by Kyle after retiring from the Navy in 2009. Ex-Navy sniper, another military vet killed at Texas gun range . ""Chris Kyle's death seems to confirm that 'he who lives by the sword dies by the sword.' Treating PTSD at a gun range doesn't make sense,"" former Texas Republican Rep. Ron Paul tweeted on Monday. But what seems like common sense to some is viewed by others as another assault on the Second Amendment. Those types of concerns are what prompted a heated debate last December as lawmakers worked to approve a defense policy bill. Republican Sen. Tom Coburn pushed and then backed away from an amendment to block the Department of Veteran Affairs from automatically entering the names of veterans deemed ""mentally incompetent"" to handle their finances from having their names entered into a national background check system, thereby blocking them from gun ownership. Instead, the Oklahoma physician wanted those case decided by a judge rather than a federal agency unless those veterans had been ""found by a judicial authority to be a danger to themselves or to others."" ""We're not asking for anything big,"" Coburn said at the time. ""We're just saying that if you're going to take away the Second Amendment rights -- they ought to have it adjudicated, rather than mandated by someone who's unqualified to state that they should lose their rights."" New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer pushed back argued that ""you should not have a gun"" whether ""you are a veteran or not and you have been judged to be mentally infirm."" National Rifle Association President David Keene said at a recent media event that his organization supports reforms that would make it tougher for mentally ill people to get guns. How the violent mentally ill can buy guns . Federal law makes it illegal to sell or give a firearm to anyone who ""has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution."" Statistics from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) show about 1 percent of applicants who failed a background check over the past 14 years, or 10,180 people, were turned down for reasons related to mental health. Overall rejections represented a fraction of prospective gun sales and most involved applicants with criminal records. Federally licensed gun shops must use the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. Private sellers and gun shows have no background check requirement. But information in the national  background check system is incomplete, particularly involving mental health records, investigations have found. Critics blame what they call a huge legal loophole, according to one study. ""PTSD is rarely associated with homicidal violence,"" Michael Welner, a forensic psychiatrist who has worked on cases of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans charged with violent crimes, told CNN's Soledad O'Brien. ""PTSD is very commonly associated with a number of other conditions that are regularly attached to violence, alcoholism, personality disorder, depression. So diagnostically, PTSD may be relevant and it may just be part of the picture, including traumatic brain injury,"" Welner said. Expanding some background checks is under consideration in Congress as lawmakers respond to public and political pressure for stricter laws following December's shooting massacre at a Connecticut elementary school. Possible steps include better monitoring of people with mental illness to prevent them from obtaining firearms. Mayors Against Illegal Guns aired an ad during the Super Bowl advocating universal background checks for gun sales. President Barack Obama also reiterated his call on Monday for comprehensive steps to address gun violence, including expanded background checks. Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran.

"(CNN)Today I'm tagging penguins in Antarctica. Not something I'd thought I would ever get the chance to do but here we are. A few hours in and it's actually quite addictive. But I'm not facing the extreme chill of the southern polar region. When I say I'm ""tagging,"" I'm manually annotating penguins, chicks and eggs on photographs taken in the region. Once I've marked the images, other citizen taggers can double check my work before penguinologists can begin to analyze the citizen-sourced data. I've become one of the nearly million citizen scientists working to help penguins in the Antarctic region through data analysis on hosted through Zooniverse, a crowdsourcing science platform. Passionate penguinologist Tom Hart, a junior research fellow in the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford, is the man behind Penguin Lifelines -- a collaborative international project researching the threats faced by Antarctic penguins. CNN caught up with the passionate scientist following his recent return from this year's trip south and found out why he continues to make the trek, what they've found and whether the end is near for these aquatic birds. CNN: Welcome back, Tom. How was your expedition to Antarctica? It must be pretty hard to work in such extreme-weather environments. Tom Hart: It's paradise. It's fantastic. It's quite draining. There's no doubt it's physically and mentally tiring but every day you wake up with a spectacular backdrop, you never forget how privileged you are -- that's for sure. CNN: What's like working ""in the field?"" TH: The way we do it is probably not what you have in mind. We go camping, we stay in huts, we grow beards in the way we're meant to according to the stereotype. But a lot of the time we're on (tourist) ships, so we get to a lot more sites than conventional scientists. We'll jump on board, or hitch hike and hop between tour ships, we might get to over 100 sites a year. Sometimes we'll only be there for three hours. But that's enough to set up or service a camera and to do a count of colony, or something like that. CNN: It's four months of quite strenuous work. Why do it? TH: We have a national data deficiency around Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic. The scale of today's problems -- i.e. climate change, fisheries and direct human disturbance -- we don't really have the resolution to work out which of those is the problem, in what order and how to deal with it. We're trying to create massive, massive data sets that automatically report what's going on and feed into policy. CNN: So where do the cameras come in? TH: We put timelapse cameras all around Antarctica and sub-Antarctic -- South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands, South Shetlands -- all along the Antarctic peninsula. (Now it's) like having a really good, dedicated biologist who doesn't eat or sleep -- just dedicated to monitoring penguins 24/7. It turns out now, it's really easy to collect data on this scale, we've cracked the logistics problem. But the hard part is how to analyze it . CNN: Enter Penguin Watch... TH: Absolutely. I've just got back and we've got over half a million data points this year alone. Humans are picking out the quirky that a computer would never pick up. And they are flagging things that are unusual and then we go in and look at and investigate more. Currently there is absolutely no way we can do this without a lot of help. When we started the project, in the first four hours, people had annotated more images than we ever had in five years. It makes a difference. CNN: And what kind of results are you seeing from the processed data? TH:  We are only just starting to get useful data but in general in the peninsula and the outlying islands we're seeing chinstraps and adelie penguins doing very poorly in their breeding. Those numbers are declining. Whereas gentoos are increasing where we monitor them and possibly spreading out. The tragic thing is that we're still quite early in understanding the problem, despite the fact that we're getting enormous amounts of data. CNN: So is there a danger we'll reach an extinction point? TH:  No, I think not actually. With sea birds around the world, where we fix some of the problems, seabirds have recovered. We're seeing that with penguins in parts of Australia, New Zealand and Africa despite the fact that most of those populations are still endangered we can see where you fix the problems locally, the outlook is good. CNN: Phew! Having spent the last five years ""down south,"" do you have a particular favorite memory of the project so far? TH: Probably the most exciting was this January when we got back to the South Sandwich islands, we placed a camera there last year and this is the first breeding data from that whole archipelago and because it's so hard to get to, no one's ever done a year's worth of observations on penguins. It's entirely new. It demonstrated that we're making a difference in one of the most remote places you could possibly be. SEE: Freediving couple's stunning underwater shoot .

"(CNN)We all know that every baby is special, but Silas Philips pulled off a rare feat right out of the womb. Days before he's scheduled to leave the hospital, he's already gone viral on social media because he was born 'en caul.' Silas was completely encased in his amniotic sac, said Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in a Facebook post. That's so rare, that even doctors delivering babies hardly see it. So Silas' doctor snapped a photo with his cell phone. It looked like the baby was trapped in a big water bubble. ""Even though it's a cliche -- we caught our breath,"" neonatologist William Binder told CNN affiliate KCAL. ""It really felt like a moment of awe."" Then Binder got to work helping Silas to breathe - and giving him special care, because Silas was born three months before his due date via Caesarean section. Later, Silas' grandmother showed the cell phone photo to his mother, Chelsea Philips. ""It was definitely like a clear film, where you could definitely make out his head and his hair,"" Philips told the affiliate. Silas was curled up in fetal position inside. The amniotic sac is an opaque bubble that covers all babies in the womb from right after conception. As the baby grows, it fills with fluid, including the baby's urine. The sac cushions the baby from bumps and jostles during mom's daily ups and downs. Normally, during a birth, it breaks, and the fluid rushes out, which is where the term 'breaking water' comes from. But sometimes, the sac can get stuck around part of the baby, according to Dr. Amos Grunebaum, an obstetrician and gynecologist, who publishes a website on birth and baby care. It can, for example, get stuck on the baby's head, which makes it look like its wearing a glass space helmet. That's also where the term caul comes from -- it derives from Latin words that refer to a helmet. After IVF shock, mom gives birth to two sets of identical twins . Such amniotic sac helmet births are rare enough, but to have the entire baby inside the sac, or 'en caul,' occurs in less than one in 80,000 births, Cedars-Sinai said. When Philips heard how rare her Baby's birth was, she was flabbergasted. ""I was like, oh my gosh, Silas, you're a little special baby,"" she told KCAL. It's particularly surprising in a C-section, because the scalpel usually pierces the amniotic sac. The doctors must have missed Silas's.

"Actor Thomas Guiry allegedly head-butted a police officer after he was told he was too drunk to board a flight at Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport last weekend, police said Wednesday. Guiry, 31, faces a felony charge of assault against a public servant in the Saturday incident, according to Houston Police spokesman John Cannon. United Airlines employees called police after they refused to let Guiry board Saturday, Cannon said. The airline workers determined he was too intoxicated to board the flight, but they wanted a police supervisor to decide if he was a candidate for a sobering center instead of being jailed for public intoxication, he said. Guiry became agitated and made repeated threats to the police sergeant after he was told he could go to the sobering center if he was compliant, Cannon said. After the threats, the officer told the actor he was under arrest, he said.  Guiry allegedly tried to kick the sergeant in the face as he was placing him under arrest. The head-butting happened as the sergeant tried to restrain him, Cannon said. Guiry was 11 when he made his acting debut in the film ""The Sandlot."" His career as a child actor also included the lead role in a ""Lassie"" movie remake in 1994 and ""The Last Home Run"" in 1996.  He's acted in several television series in recent years, including a recent episode of ""Elementary.""","Guiry, 31, faces a felony charge of assault against a public servant .

"Washington (CNN)North Carolina might be going rogue. The state is on a collision course with the Republican National Committee over when to hold its presidential primary next year. National Republicans -- intent on fashioning an orderly nominating process after several chaotic cycles -- are threatening trigger-happy primary and caucus states with drastic penalties if they attempt to leapfrog the voting line and disrupt the carefully plotted primary calendar. But a handful of North Carolina GOP legislators are vowing to defend a recently passed law that places their state's primary fifth-in-line, in late February 2016, right after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina raise the curtain on the Republican and Democratic nomination battles. ""North Carolina is the biggest threat to the calendar now because there is an uncertainty around the primary here that does not exist elsewhere,"" said Josh Putnam, a professor at Appalachian State University in Boone, North Carolina, who runs the web site ""Frontloading HQ,"" which covers the presidential primary system in obsessive detail. Backers of the early Tar Heel primary sound a lot like the mischief-making Tallahassee lawmakers who pushed for Florida to hold an earlier-than-expected primary in 2008 and 2012, despite penalties from the national party committees that stripped them of delegates to the national convention. ""We deserve a voice as much as any other state,"" said Bob Rucho, a conservative state senator from the Charlotte area who is championing the new primary date. ""Any state that chooses to should be able to have their citizens be involved in the process of choosing the candidate. The other system has made selections from Dole to McCain to Romney, and each of them did not succeed in winning the presidency. We just feel there is a better way of doing this."" If North Carolina goes early and holds its primary before March 1, the RNC would chop its sizeable delegation of 72 delegates down to 12, making the state a dubious prize for candidates on hunt for convention delegates. Rucho said the penalty would ""disenfranchise Republican voters."" ""We have won a governorship, two U.S. senators and the General Assembly,"" he said. ""North Carolina has been one of the leading states in strengthening the Republican Party, and we feel that any sanctions against us would be against a group of people who have made great strides in helping the Republican Party in the Southeast and in the rest of the country."" The law in question, signed by Gov. Pat McCrory in late 2013 as part of an election overhaul package that included strict new voter identification regulations, dictates that the North Carolina primary, for both Democrats and Republicans, must occur on the Tuesday after South Carolina's 2016 presidential primary. The first four ""carve out"" states that kick off the primary process are the only ones allowed to hold contests in February. The exact dates have not been set. But South Carolina, the first-in-the-South primary that can make or break a candidate riding high out of Iowa or New Hampshire, holds its contest on a Saturday. That means North Carolina would hold its primary on a Tuesday in late February, just three days after South Carolina, if the law remains in place. That's a quick turnaround that might water down South Carolina's prized relevance. ""The North Carolina legislature needs to come to its senses on choosing a primary date,"" said South Carolina GOP Chairman Matt Moore. ""Holding their primary in February would be disastrous for the state party and activists."" Democrats have almost no power in the GOP-controlled North Carolina legislature, and their presidential primary at this point looks more like a Hillary Clinton coronation than an election. But the new date also violates Democratic National Committee rules and would result in steep penalties for the state's Democratic convention delegates. Besides the early burst of national attention, Rucho said one reason to hold the North Carolina primary in February, rather than its traditional slot in May, is that candidates will already be spending their money and time in South Carolina. So, he asked, why not make it easier for candidates to compete in a contest next door, when they've already unleashed their money on television ads in media markets such as Charlotte, Asheville and Wilmington that bleed into into northern swaths of South Carolina? ""The logic behind it is that a good number of a people in the southern portion of the state, the media markets there, will already be engaged,"" Rucho said. ""Since they are here already, it would be smart for us to move forward and have it a week after South Carolina. It's efficiency and reducing the costs of campaign expenses. They will have been here already, the money will have been spent."" That flies in the face of carefully laid plans by the RNC, which vowed to crack down on rogue states after an unruly 2012 nomination fight that saw several states jump the line, forcing Iowa and New Hampshire to move their contests into the frozen early days of January. So far, the 2016 primary order seems to be holding, with other states such as Michigan passing laws to comply with RNC rules after their dates conflicted with the calendar. For the first time since 1996, the Iowa caucuses are on pace to happen in February, sparing voters, campaign staffers and reporters from another holiday season in last-minute campaign mode. But North Carolina remains a wild card, drawing scrutiny from national party leaders. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus called McCrory last week to discuss the situation, one GOP source told CNN, and Thom Tillis, the state's junior senator, ""supports holding North Carolina's primary on a date consistent with RNC rules,"" a spokesman for the senator said. Richard Burr, the state's senior senator who is up for re-election in 2016, declined to comment on the situation through a spokeswoman. North Carolina GOP Chairman Claude Pope Jr., who has a fraught relationship with Rucho, published an op-ed in The Charlotte Observer calling on the legislature to move the primary to March 1, where it would join seven other Southern states banding together for a multistate ""SEC Primary"" day. ""Our legislature had good intentions when it established a February primary date, assuming that the world would beat a path to our door -- bringing national media exposure, money, and an economic boom-let to North Carolina,"" Pope wrote. ""But the crowded field of presidential wannabes will not step foot in our state. They will not visit the fire stations or Rotary Clubs. They won't ride in the parades, eat barbecue, kiss babies or spend their millions fighting over just 12 delegates -- it simply isn't worth the money."" Several Republicans close to the process told CNN that the North Carolina House of Representatives is willing to pass legislation changing the primary date before the legislative sessions concludes this summer. One of the RNC's national committeeman from North Carolina, David Lewis, is a member of the General Assembly and likely to drive the discussions. The hold up appears to be in the state Senate, where Rucho, state Sen. Andrew Brock and their vocal conservative allies are adamant about keeping the February date. ""We have had this on the books for almost a year and a half,"" Rucho said. It's not yet clear whether the opinions of Rucho and his allies are shared by most members of the GOP caucus. But state Senate President Phil Berger, who would bring legislation on the primary to the floor, ""rarely does anything to go against their wishes,"" one Republican familiar with Senate politics told CNN. ""Berger doesn't want to cross these guys too many times,"" the source said. ""He is kind of indifferent to all this."" Senior Republicans in Washington and North Carolina are confident the state will ultimately move its primary. But if it fails to do so, and North Carolina loses its delegates, presidential campaigns will have to weigh the costs of campaigning in the ninth most populous state and the pricey media markets that come with it. ""It's an extremely expensive state,"" said one political consultant working with a likely Republican presidential candidate. ""Spending millions to compete for 12 delegate votes would be malpractice.""","Some GOP legislators vow to defend a law that places North Carolina's primary fifth-in-line .

"Atlanta (CNN)Doctors treating Bobbi Kristina Brown, who remains in a medically induced coma, tried taking her off various medications, according to a source close to her family. They were forced to put her back on the drugs because she started having seizures, the source told CNN on Wednesday. Brown, daughter of the late star Whitney Houston, was found unresponsive in a bathtub on January 31 at her home in Roswell, Georgia. The extent of her injuries is not known. Last week, doctors removed her breathing tube, allowing Brown to be ventilated through a hole in her throat. At the time, CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said the move suggested she would need to be on such support for ""weeks and months to come, as opposed to hours and days."" Police have said they're treating Brown's case as a criminal investigation. Her mother, who died in 2012, was similarly found in a bathtub. A coroner ruled Houston's death an accidental drowning, with heart disease and cocaine use listed as contributing factors. Brown, 21, is her only child.","Bobbi Kristina Brown has seizures after doctors take her off medication, source says .

"Hong Kong (CNN)Please be more like sheep. Believe it or not, that's the Lunar New Year message for the people of Hong Kong from the city's leader C.Y. Leung. ""In the coming year, I hope that all people in Hong Kong will take inspiration from the sheep's character and pull together in an accommodating manner to work for Hong Kong's future,"" he said. Hong Kong's leader is hoping his flock won't rock the boat after one very tumultuous year. For 79 days in late 2014, student-led protests for democratic open elections took over major streets in the heart of the city. It was the biggest political challenge to Beijing since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. And while the Umbrella Movement, so named after umbrellas were used to shield protesters from the tear gas and pepper spray deployed by police, is no longer blocking the roads, Hong Kong's young protesters have vowed to return in force in the Year of the Sheep. ""I believe within this year they will have a new act, they will have occupy action or civil disobedience again,"" says Joshua Wong, the teenage face of the Occupy protests and co-founder of the student activist group Scholarism. ""And Occupy action will be happening more often in the future."" As pledged in their ""we'll be back"" slogans at the end of the protest in December, the demonstrators plan to return and will once again rely on the civil disobedience tactics that eventually turned public opinion against them. ""It's the only way I see now that will actually give pressure to the government because you are actually blocking the roads, causing some problems and some trouble to the government,"" says student activist Glacier Kwong of Keyboard Frontline. ""It will increase the ruling cost of the government so that they will have to react."" Young people have been at the forefront of the democracy movement in Hong Kong, where they face a growing shortage of university places, disappointing job prospects, and a widening wealth gap. But they -- and the pro-democracy legislators who have joined their protest -- insist the reason for their protest is both economic and political. ""The livelihood issue of the people of Hong Kong is very much affected by the political structure which completely swings over to the upper class and the elite,"" says Lee Cheuk-Yan, a pro-democracy lawmaker and former student activist who was detained during the Tiananmen uprising. ""For young people in Hong Kong, if you want to climb that so-called ladder of mobility, you have to be politically ...correct and that is horrible."" Since the handover from Britain in 1997, Hong Kong has been governed under China's principle of ""one country, two systems"" -- giving it rights and freedoms unseen in the mainland. But Hong Kong's student protesters want more. They want the right to vote on candidates for chief executive who are independent of Beijing. ""It's not like the Chinese government owes us anything,"" says Kwong. ""We have the right to have these things. We have the right to have democracy -- true democracy -- and universal suffrage because this is a human right."" Creating 'a miracle' Idealistic words.  And her teenage ally is not shy to admit the challenges ahead. ""Fighting for true universal suffrage in Hong Kong is trying turn something impossible to possible,"" concedes Joshua Wong. ""Under the democracy movement, every activist is trying to create a miracle."" In the early days of the Umbrella Movement,  Kwong posted an earnest online appeal to ""Please help Hong Kong."" The clip quickly went viral, reaching more than a million views. After making the cover of Time magazine's international edition, Wong was included in the magazine's annual list of most influential teenagers. Their struggle for democracy was also mentioned this week in an Oscars acceptance speech, as musician Common linked the American civil rights movement to Occupy Hong Kong. Such global attention is coveted by the territory's pro-democracy activists. ""What we need is international public opinion to keep a watch on China, so that they should leave Hong Kong alone,"" says Lee. ""We in Hong Kong, we have nothing. We don't have arms, we don't have anything to protect ourselves. We have just the people."" And people in Hong Kong are nothing like sheep, especially its young activists. They are dauntless and determined to have a say in Hong Kong's political destiny.","In his Lunar New Year message HK leader C.Y. Leung urged residents to be more accommodating, like sheep .

"(CNN)The choice of a word by Pope Francis has drawn ire from Mexico's government. And on Wednesday, the Vatican told Mexico that the Pontiff meant no offense. In a private email to a friend, Francis had lamented increased drug trafficking in his native Argentina, using the term ""Mexicanization."" ""Hopefully, we are still in time to avoid the 'Mexicanization.' I was talking to some Mexican bishops and it's a terrible situation,"" Francis allegedly wrote. Mexico's chief diplomat took offense and said he would send a note of protest to the Pontiff over the term. ""We would like to express our sadness and concern about the statements made regarding a private letter from Pope Francis,"" said Foreign Minister Jose Antonio Meade. The ministry also contacted a Vatican diplomat. The Vatican's secretary of state responded Wednesday and admitted to Pope Francis' choice of words but said, ""The Pope did not in any way intend to offend the Mexican population, for whom he holds special affection, nor to underestimate the commitment of the Mexican government in its fight against narco-trafficking."" The secretary said the expression was part of a ""private and informal email"" to a someone ""who had used this phrase."" Mexican authorities have battled drug cartels for nearly 10 years, and more than 60,000 people have died in that fight, Human Rights Watch has said. Mexico is the main supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine in the United States, and 90% of cocaine arriving in the country is trafficked through Mexico. In recent years, according to Foreign Policy magazine, Mexican drug cartels have expanded their activities into Argentina.

"(CNN)The case of three teenage British girls, who are believed to have traveled to Syria to join ISIS, has refocused attention on the Islamic extremist group's appeal to young people. Children and young people feature in the terrorist group's propaganda, including a recent video showing boys in camouflage and ISIS bandanas learning hand-to-hand combat. The militants call them their ""Cubs of the Caliphate."" Experts say ISIS has especially ramped up its efforts to lure young women -- seen as potential brides for its fighters -- into the territory under its brutal control in Syria and Iraq. But that still leaves the question of why its recruitment drive appears to be proving so successful. ""There's no question what we're combating with ISIL's propaganda machine is something we have not seen before,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told CNN. ""It's something we need to do a lot more work on. We are seeing 90,000, I think, tweets a day that we're combating."" The militants have repeatedly promoted videos using high-level production techniques to celebrate their brutality. A short mash-up clip in September played like a trailer for an action movie, with slow-motion explosions and flames engulfing American troops. UK surveillance chief Robert Hannigan has said ISIS and other extremist groups use platforms like Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp to reach their target audience in a language it understands. Their methods include exploiting popular hashtags to disseminate their message, he said. ISIS also use its Western recruits to promote the cause to other people like them back home. And the extremist group is putting a particular focus on girls, analysts say. ""We're seeing young women from across Western countries both expressing their support for and migrating to Syria now in totally unprecedented numbers,"" said Sasha Havlicek, chief executive of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. ""And I would say this is the result really of an extremely sophisticated propaganda recruitment machinery that's targeting young women very specifically."" How ISIS makes (and takes) money . Analysts say that ISIS can appeal to young people's religious idealism and to a desire to escape the frustrations of life in the West. ""ISIS provides a utopian political project, the so-called caliphate, the centralized Islamic rule,"" Gerges said. ""ISIS provides these deluded young men and women with an adventurous trip."" As a reward for allegiance, ISIS loyalists receive gifts from Allah including ""a house with free electricity and water provided to you due to the Khilafah (the caliphate or state) and no rent included,"" according to Aqsa Mahmood, a British teenager who left Scotland to join ISIS in 2013. ""Sounds great, right?"" writes Mahmood, who now appears to blog about life under ISIS rule and is believed to have communicated with one of the three British girls who recently left for Syria. Mahmood offers assurances to women who might be worried about roughing it: ""You can find shampoos, soaps and other female necessities here, so do not stress if you think you will be experiencing some cavewoman life here."" Western officials, though, say that ISIS is pushing a false narrative of what it's really like in its territory. People who heed its call ""erroneously believe they are going out to help people,"" said Yasmin Qureshi, a British lawmaker. ""And they don't think ISIS is doing anything wrong because they think ISIS is helping people in their sort of warped thinking."" Everything to know about the rise of ISIS . ""It took so little time for these three young, innocent, vulnerable girls to from the heart of London to the heart of Turkey -- and probably they are in areas controlled either by ISIS or other militant groups,"" said Gerges, referring to the British teenagers. He stressed ""the important presence of a person who basically serves as a middleman or middlewoman between young men and women in the West and ISIS militants in Iraq and Syria."" U.S. investigators studied the case of three teenage Colorado girls who tried to join ISIS last year to learn more about how the militant group recruits young people in the West. The FBI found examples of Westerners already in the ISIS fold who were communicating directly with new recruits via social media. Believed to be operating from Turkey, Syria and Iraq, the online recruiters helped provide how-to guides for Westerners who are inclined to travel and join the ISIS fight, officials said. But even after identifying them, officials couldn't see a clear path to arresting them. Most are thought to be out of reach of U.S. law enforcement. How ISIS is run . Social media services may have been largely invented in the West, but ISIS is outflanking governments in how it uses the platforms. ""We are way behind. They are far superior and advanced than we are when it comes to new media technologies,"" Maajid Nawaz, a former jihadi and author of ""Radical: My Journey out of Islamist Extremism,"" told CNN last year. British Prime Minister David Cameron has said the case of the three British girls highlights the need to fight ISIS on multiple fronts. ""It needs every school, every university, every college, every community to recognize they have a role to play, we all have a role to play in stopping people from having their minds poisoned by this appalling death cult,"" he said. The U.S. government is trying to step up its efforts to counter ISIS propaganda by beefing up a small State Department agency to make it the heart of the fight against the militants' messaging. ""We're seeing their approaches continue to evolve,"" Psaki told CNN. ""We need to continue to make sure ours are evolving and we're combating it in the most strategic way and using every interagency resource."" But she acknowledged that the United States still has a lot to do. ""We're really going to pick it up now,"" Psaki said. ""We have new people in charge of the office. And we will see what happens over the coming months."" From Scottish teen to ISIS bride and recruiter .

""That's not what we're doing. We had a really important fight in the United States Congress just this past week, and I'm putting all my energy into that fight, into what happens after this,"" the Massachusetts Democrat said. Inskeep pointed out that she was speaking in the present tense, and that she hadn't said she would ""never"" run, but Warren didn't change her tune, eventually becoming so exasperated she demanded, ""do you want me to put an exclamation point at the end?"" The questions came in the context of a growing movement to draft Warren into the presidential race, launched by a handful of progressive groups that see her as a transformative figure on the left. And they follow a weekend in which she emerged as a powerful figure on the left as the leader of Democratic opposition to a must-pass government spending bill that included policy riders that progressives found unpalatable. One rider rolled back a key provision of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, a pet priority of Warren's. And defections from both Democrats and Republicans in the House threatened passage of the bill and brought Congress to the brink of another shutdown this week. It eventually passed both the House and the Senate, however, and Warren said Monday morning that ""we don't want to shut down the government,"" suggesting she has no plans to take Congress past the brink to defend her priorities. But the newly-minted member of Senate Democratic leadership hinted she'd continue to stoke controversy within the party.

"(CNN)Abror Habibov, 30, operated kiosks at malls along the East Coast. He sold kitchenware and repaired mobile phones, according to a complaint unsealed Wednesday in federal court in Brooklyn, New York. Last fall, Habibov hired Akhror Saidakhmetov, 19, to work at kiosks in Savannah, Georgia; Philadelphia and Chesapeake, Virginia. Abdurasul Juraboev, 24, a Uzbekistan native and legal permanent U.S. resident, worked at the Gyro King restaurant in Brooklyn. He asked his boss whether he could leave this weekend because he was traveling. Until their arrests Wednesday in connection with an alleged failed attempt to join ISIS in Syria, Saidakhmetov and Juraboev appeared to live the mundane lives of ordinary Brooklyn immigrants. They also appeared careless in planning their alleged plot. One man, for instance, showed up at U.S. Homeland Security offices to apply for a travel document, authorities said. They sometimes communicated online because they believed it would be harder for authorities to trace. Juraboev allegedly discussed assassinating President Barack Obama, according to the complaint. But he told an FBI agent that he ""currently does not have the means or an imminent plan to do so."" Juraboev and Saidakhmetov, authorities said, planned to embark on the journey to Turkey on Wednesday. Read the criminal complaint against trio . One of them discussed the possibility of hijacking a commercial flight to Turkey and diverting it ""to the Islamic State, so that the Islamic State would gain a plane,"" the complaint said. They also talked about joining the U.S. military in order to attack soldiers. Juraboev and Saidakhmetov were arrested in New York; Habibov in Florida. They face charges that include attempting and conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization, the complaint said. ""This is real,"" New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters. ""This is the concern about the lone wolf inspired to act without ever going to the Middle East or the concern of once they get to the Mideast, acquire fighting skills, capabilities and then attempting to return to the country."" Saidakhmetov was arrested Wednesday at John F. Kennedy International Airport attempting to catch a flight to Turkey, authorities said. Juraboev, who was to catch a later flight, was arrested at his home in Brooklyn. Habibov, who Bratton said ""helped organize and finance"" the operation, was in Jacksonville, Florida, when he was picked up. In addition to threats against Obama, the suspects allegedly talked of killing U.S. law enforcement officers. Juraboev allegedly mentioned planting a bomb at Coney Island if ordered to do so by ISIS. An FBI intelligence bulletin to state and local law enforcement urged officers to be vigilant for not only recruits, but people who may want to carry out attacks. ""These individuals highlight the continued interest among U.S.-based violent extremist to support designated terrorist organizations,"" the bulletin said. Outside federal court in Brooklyn, attorney Adam Perlmutter, who represents Saidakhmetov, said his client will plead not guilty if indicted. ""This case really makes us question the federal government's approach ... to young Muslim men in America,"" he told reporters. ""They are very ham-fisted tactics. There is no attempt to intervene, to speak, to explore, to understand. There's just the rush to prosecution, to arrest, and to conviction."" The arrests come at the same time that a federal jury in Brooklyn hears testimony in the trial against a Pakistani man allegedly involved in a separate al Qaeda conspiracy to carry out attacks in New York and Europe. In the case against the three Brooklyn men, court documents said two of them posted parts of their plans on an Uzbek-language website, believing that the communications would be harder to trace. Saidakhmetov is from Kazakhstan and a legal permanent U.S. resident. Habibov, who is from Uzbekistan, was in the U.S. legally but overstayed his visa, police said. Authorities began trailing them in August 2014. The three men lived in Brooklyn. Saidakhmetov and Juraboev were to appear in Brooklyn federal court later Wednesday; Habibov in federal court in Jacksonville. The names of lawyers for Habibov and Juraboev were not immediately available. In a conversation recorded by authorities, Saidakhmetov said that if he was unable to get travel documents to Syria, ""I will just go out and buy a machine gun, AK-47, go out and shoot all police,"" according to the complaint. Saidakhmetov told an informant that carrying a gun in the United States was legal. ""We will go and purchase one handgun ... then go and shoot one police officer,"" he is quoted as saying, according to the complaint. ""Boom ...Then, we will take his gun, bullets and a bulletproof vest ... then, we will do the same with a couple of others."" He said, ""Then we will go to the FBI headquarters, kill the FBI people."" In a written statement in the Uzbek language, Juraboev allegedly speaks of killing Obama for ""Allah"" but notes he doesn't have the means to do it. ""I also want to fight and sincerely become a martyr under the Islamic Caliphate,"" he states, using another name for ISIS. On his journey, Saidakhmetov allegedly ""proposed finding an excuse to gain access to the pilot's cabin and diverting the plane to the Islamic State, so that the Islamic State would gain a plane,"" the complaint said. In November, Juraboev and Saidakhmetov also expressed interest in joining the U.S. military in order to pass information to ISIS about American airstrikes against the terror group, the complaint said. When Juraboev said he was skeptical that Saidakhmetov ""could stay calm and avoid trouble in the military, (Saidakhmetov) responded that he could always open fire on American soldiers and kill as many of them as possible."" In another conversation, Juraboev allegedly criticized Saidakhmetov's plan to join the military, saying that ""leaving for Syria would be the most feasible choice."" In intercepted online communication, Juraboev said his parents were in Uzbekistan. ""Sometimes they worship and practice Islam, sometimes they do idolatry,"" he said, according to the complaint. ""My sisters are uncovered, lack knowledge of a religion. I wish they knew at least how to cover themselves up."" At one point, Juraboev called Obama ""an enemy Of Allah,"" and says, ""I will execute Obama."" On February 21, Juraboev sent his employer a text message: ""Brother I want to leave my country next weekend. Because I have some problem. Is it possible or not? Sorry!"" Saidakhmetov allegedly told a confidential informant that he intended to wage jihad in Syria but that his mother -- fearful that he would do so --  took his passport. The suspect then said he would try to get his passport back by telling his mother that he was traveling to Uzbekistan to visit relatives. On February 2, Saidakhmetov brazenly appeared at the Department of Homeland Security offices in Manhattan and filled out an application for a travel document and had his photograph and fingerprints taken, the complaint said. Saidakhmetov and a confidential informant at one time watched videos of ISIS training camps in Syria, the complaint said, adding that Saidakhmetov said he was going to ""become a Mujahid on the path of Allah"" in war-torn Mideast country. The complaint said Saidakhmetov on February 19 purchased a round-trip ticket for $571 to travel from New York to Istanbul, Turkey, on Wednesday. He was to return on March 31. In Brooklyn, the travel agent who sold him the ticket on February 19 said Saidakhmetov picked the cheaper flight with a connection in Kiev, Ukraine, rather than paying $900 for a direct flight to Turkey. ""There was nothing out the ordinary about the transaction or him,"" said the travel agent, who asked not to be identified. Saidakhmetov purchased the ticket using a New York State ID. His flight on Ukraine International Airlines was to depart at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday. Saidakhmetov had earlier told the informant -- who he believed was traveling with him -- that if detected at the airport he would ""kill a police officer and use the officer's gun to shoot other law enforcement officers.""

"(CNN)Beneful dry dog food produced by Nestle Purina PetCare has ""resulted in serious illness and death of thousands of dogs,"" a lawsuit says. The eight kinds of Beneful dog food have caused internal bleeding, liver failure, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, seizures, bloat and kidney failure, the suit said. The named plaintiff in the suit describes how one of his dogs died after eating Beneful and two of his dogs got sick. In the past four years, consumers have made more than 3,000 online complaints about dogs becoming ill or dying after eating Beneful, the lawsuit says. Bill Salzman, director of corporate communications for Nestle Purina PetCare, issued a statement denying the allegations in the lawsuit. ""We believe the lawsuit is baseless, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and our brand. Beneful had two previous class action suits filed in recent years with similar baseless allegations, and both were dismissed by the courts. ""Like other pet foods, Beneful is occasionally the subject of social media-driven misinformation. Online postings often contain false, unsupported and misleading allegations that cause undue concern and confusion for our Beneful customers. ""Bottom line: Consumers can continue to feed Beneful with total confidence."" The class action lawsuit, filed February 5 in U.S. District Court in Northern California, seeks $5 million in damages. The plaintiff, Frank Lucido of Discovery Bay, California, says he first purchased Beneful food in December or January, the suit says. Lucido's German Shepherd, Nella, became ill on January 17 and his English bulldog, Dozer, was found dead January 23 in the yard, the lawsuit says. Lucido's third dog, a Labrador named Remo, became sick around the same time, the suit says. The lawsuit says Purina Nestle knew Beneful dog food was harmful and sold it without adequate testing and without properly investigating reports of pet deaths and illnesses. Beneful contains propylene glycol, an auto antifreeze component, and mycotoxins, toxins produced by fungus found in grains, the lawsuit says.

"(CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin has insisted that the Minsk II ceasefire agreement from February 12 is the road to ""a final settlement"" of the conflict in Ukraine -- and although the truce is shaky, Ukraine and the West have a strong interest in seeing it hold. The West is not going to enter into a proxy war with Russia -- and Ukraine's best hope is to wind down the war and to use the breathing space for much-needed reform. Minsk II confirms the military gains Russia has made in Ukraine and gives Moscow plenty of leverage over Kiev. But compared to war, it is the lesser evil. In fact, the agreement could be turned to Ukraine's advantage, providing the country with the breathing space it urgently needs to enact political and economic changes. A stronger Ukrainian state -- more functional, less corrupt, and better able to deliver to its citizens -- would be much more capable to resist Russian aggression. It is Ukraine's weakness that has allowed Russia to invade the country in the east. A weak sense of national solidarity and togetherness there, as well as insufficient supervision of the border, allowed unofficial and official Russian troops to enter into the Donbass region. And a badly-trained, badly-equipped and badly-organized army wasn't able to push back. As long as the conflict in the east continues, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's new government will only reluctantly pursue reform. In times of war, national unity is needed to mobilize potential support --this is not the time to fight the abuse of power in the country by mighty oligarchs, as their support is urgently needed for the war effort. But if Minsk II holds, Ukraine can refocus its energy on tackling its biggest internal challenge, which has been neglected for more than two decades: to build proper state institutions. A new Ukraine could emerge democratic, liberal, and much better governed, a country that would become attractive not only to its own citizens -- millions have emigrated in the last few years -- but also to Western investors. The momentum is there. Poroshenko's government has made some small but promising steps in the right direction. And the Maidan generation, a much more politicized civil society, continues to exert pressure on leaders. Unlike its predecessors, the government knows that it needs to deliver. If not, sovereignty again might fall back to the citizens in a new Maidan that could push the current leadership away. The terms of Minsk II are however favorable to Russia. It represents the current correlation of forces. Russia is much stronger militarily than Ukraine, even under the self-imposed condition of keeping Russian engagement on the level of deniability. And the West is not ready to seriously tip the military balance in Ukraine's favor. Not surprisingly, Minsk II is not aimed at directly restoring Ukraine's territorial integrity. While the first Minsk agreement, reached in September, stipulated that international observers would monitor the Russian-Ukrainian border, Minsk II makes the return of the border to Ukraine conditional on constitutional reform -- a new constitution to which representatives of the rebel-held territory must agree. In practice, this means that Ukraine has to negotiate its new constitution with the Kremlin. The choice for Ukraine is -- according to the current truce -- to accept either that the rebel-held territory is going to be built up as a heavily-armed Russian proxy state, or to accept a new constitution that will give Russia substantial influence over the future course of the country. Either Russia can switch on and switch off the war at will, or Ukraine accepts giving up the substance of its sovereignty. Either way, Russia will have achieved its goal of bringing Ukraine back into its sphere of influence. Ukraine and its Western supporters must develop a counter-strategy. Russia is weaker than it may seem. Its economy is heavily damaged by plunging oil prices and Western sanctions. The costs of the conflict have been high. Over the last year, the Kremlin had to learn some hard lessons: that the West is relatively united against Russia's attack on Ukraine, enough to impose tough sanctions; that Ukrainians in the east don't welcome Russians as liberators, and that many are ready to fight for their independence; and that the appetite for war with Ukraine is pretty low in Russia. Putin's regime is not suicidal. Winding down the war and rebuilding ties with the West is therefore a political and economic necessity, at least over the mid-term. Ultimately, the contract between Putin and Russian voters remains focused on economic well-being, on sharing at least part of the income from natural resources. This contract can only temporarily be switched to aggressive patriotism -- over the longer term, the regime needs to deliver some degree of prosperity. The challenge for Ukraine and its Western supporters is to turn Minsk II into an opportunity. The government must demonstrate its fierce dedication to reform and start a serious fight against corruption. If the war loses prominence at some point, there will be no excuse for inaction. The task is huge, but the Maidan movement and the tensions Russia have created a new sense of citizenship for some in Ukraine -- one that the government must seize upon. The trick will be to remain under the threshold of what Russia may see as a provocation that could trigger fresh rounds of warfare. But if Ukraine can quickly move forward with its reform agenda, and if Russia becomes weaker as the economic crisis hits the country hard, the advantage may soon be on the Ukrainian side. The stronger Ukraine becomes -- politically, economically and also militarily -- the more difficult it will be for Russia to control the interpretation of Minsk II. And if that succeeds, and Ukraine one day becomes a shining example of freedom and prosperity -- like Poland -- people in Donbas may one day push for reunification, just as East Germans pushed for reunification in 1989. The zone of liberal-democratic stability will move further east, ultimately challenging the autocratic petro-state that Putin has built in Russia. Whether this can work or not depends primarily on Ukraine: on the readiness of civil society to stay engaged and push for reform, the readiness of the bureaucracy to embrace a new order, and the readiness of oligarchs to give up their social and political power in order to maintain positions of economic leadership. It also depends on the West: Firstly, the EU and U.S. must make it as costly as possible for Russia to switch on war as a means to prevent Ukraine's reform. Unfortunately, the temptation for Russia to use this tool will remain, as military power is its only remaining strength. Moscow must be told in clear terms that the West is going to react to a full return to the battlefield with harsh measures. The West must also make up for two decades of disinterest in and neglect of Ukraine and start with serious engagement with Kiev to help it to build a decent state, to give Ukrainians a perspective. A ""Compact for Ukraine,"" announced by Angela Merkel, Barack Obama and other Western leaders in Kiev in April that puts all kind of support into a package would be a good start. The West doesn't want to fight Russia in Ukraine militarily. But in response to the military invasion in the east, the West must now swarm the country with help and support. It is in the interest of Ukraine, and in the interest of a European order that has brought the continent the freest, most peaceful and most prosperous epoch of its history.","Ukraine and the West have a strong interest in seeing the Minsk II ceasefire agreement hold .
Ukraine's best hope is to use the breathing space for much-needed reform ."
"(CNN)With all the health setbacks he has endured, Rafael Nadal is used to comebacks. He made another one Friday at the exhibition Mubadala World Tennis Championship in Abu Dhabi but it didn't last long, as the 14-time grand slam champion was crushed by Andy Murray 6-2 6-0 in the semifinals. While Nadal most certainly would have wanted to put up a better showing, he'll probably just be happy -- for the moment -- that he has physically recovered from the appendix surgery that forced him to skip the year-end ATP World Tour Finals in London last November. He'll have a little over two weeks to find his game before the start of the year's first grand slam, the Australian Open, and he vows to make progress. Next week the Spaniard -- who suffered a back injury in last year's Australian Open final and skipped last year's U.S. Open with a wrist complaint -- competes at the Qatar Open in nearby Doha. ""There are only small things I need to adjust,"" Nadal, who has competed in just three ATP tournaments since Wimbledon, was quoted as saying by the Gulf News. ""6-2 6-0 is too much -- I had a lot of chances to have a closer result,"" he added. ""I have to improve, that's obvious, and I'm going to improve. This match helps me and the defeat does not affect me too much. ""I felt I was dominating the points a lot of times, but I am missing competitive spirit. I am going to keep working hard."" Murray, too, knows what it's like to return from injuries. The two-time grand slam winner from Scotland underwent back surgery late in 2013 and never really found his form in 2014, achieving one grand slam semifinal. His body is feeling better, though. The off-season has certainly been eventful for Murray. He cut ties with his co-coach and good friend Dani Vallverdu and longtime fitness trainer Jez Green. In happier news, however, he announced his engagement to girlfriend Kim Sears. Murray faces a rematch with world No. 1 Novak Djokovic -- Murray's pal and victim in both of his successes in grand slam finals -- on Saturday. Djokovic ousted Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka 6-1 6-2 in the other semifinal. It was Wawrinka who upended the Serb en route to the Australian Open title in 2014, breaking up the dominance of the Big Four.","Andy Murray routs Rafael Nadal 6-2 6-0 at the Mubadala exhibition tournament .

"(CNN)For sheer cruelty, they are well matched. They also share an apocalyptic ""end-of-days"" vision. Now there are signs that Boko Haram -- the most feared group in West Africa -- may be edging toward a formal pledge of allegiance to the self-declared Caliph of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Observers of Boko Haram, which has inflicted years of terror on northern Nigeria, note that its actions in the last six months have frequently mimicked those of ISIS -- from punishments such as stoning and beheading of its victims to taking territory and an increasingly sophisticated use of social media that's very much in the ISIS ""style."" The latest sign that Boko Haram is wooing ISIS came on Sunday with a series of tweets released by jihadist site Afriqiyah Media, which declared its own allegiance to ISIS in December. One tweet quoted Boko Haram's own media arm as saying: ""We give you glad tidings that the group's Shurah Council is at the stage of consulting and studying, and we will let you know soon the group's decision in respect to pledging allegiance to the Caliph of the Muslims Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, may Allah preserve him,"" according to a translation by SITE Intelligence. The message was purportedly posted on February 9. It's an unusual if unverifiable commentary on Boko Haram's internal processes. Jacob Zenn, who follows Boko Haram's operations and propaganda closely, says, ""It is possible that due to factions within Boko Haram the shura was unable to come to an agreement at this point."" ""Despite this,"" Zenn told CNN, ""It's clear Boko Haram is leaning toward ISIS in terms of doctrine, ideology and an emphasis on holding territory after operations."" In August last year, Boko Haram declared its own ""caliphate"" -- after seizing the area around Gwoza in Borno state. At other times its media arm has spoken of the ""Islamic State in Africa"" and the ""Islamic State in West Africa."" In terms of ideology, Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau has said that kidnappings and hostage-taking are approved in the Quran, a claim ISIS also makes. ""Our hostages are Christians or corrupted Muslims who follow the Christian way,"" he said last year, referring to the schoolgirls kidnapped in Chibok, Nigeria, most of whom remain missing. ISIS later referred to the Chibok abductions in its kidnapping of hundreds of Yazidi women and girls. Zenn and other analysts point out that recent Boko Haram videos have resembled the polished media productions of ISIS. Zenn notes they ""have the same choreography and lens angles as ISIS, particularly its video of John Cantlie in Kobani."" The group's latest production -- released at the weekend and showing fighting around the town of Baga in Borno state -- was a high-definition offering with advanced graphics, audio effects and gratuitous brutality that could easily have been produced by ISIS. Boko Haram has also begun distributing photographs and videos through its Twitter accounts, (one of which was no longer accessible Tuesday, February 24.) Boko Haram has begun using ISIS symbolism in its media productions and operations. The Nigerian press noted with alarm last July that Boko Haram militants had been seen raising ISIS' rayat al-uqab flag along the Nigerian-Cameroon border. Recent videos have featured the same flag. Nor is Boko Haram shy about appealing for help from ISIS. The message posted on February 9 requested the ""mujahideen of the Islamic State to deliver our message to all Muslims that your brothers in Nigeria are calling you to immigrate to us, to assist us in managing the areas in which we have control and fight the alliance of the disbelievers."" A formal pledge of allegiance may only occur once a positive response is assured. Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, has spoken in glowing terms of al-Baghdadi and ISIS, as well as al Qaeda, saying last July: ""My brethren... may Allah protect you."" A recent video from the group featured an image of al-Baghdadi in Mosul, Iraq, last year. So far, the response from ISIS has been muted, especially when compared to al-Baghdadi's very public proclamation of ""provinces"" in Libya and Egypt. One reason may be that ISIS doesn't altogether trust Shekau -- whose pronouncements are often incoherent and meandering -- and perceives Boko Haram to be disunited. ISIS may also be wary of Boko Haram's existing links with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM); al Qaeda and ISIS are competing for leadership of the global jihadist movement. However, some factions within AQIM have themselves pledged to ISIS, and analysts note that some prominent supporters of ISIS -- such as Shaybah al-Hamad -- have begun promoting statements and videos produced by Boko Haram. Earlier this month, U.S. National Counterterrorism Center Director Nicholas Rasmussen told a congressional hearing that there was ""increased intercommunication between Boko Haram and other terrorist groups in the northwestern part of Africa and even with ISIL,"" using another acronym for ISIS. In an interview with the al Hayat newspaper last weekend, Libyan Foreign Minister Mohammed al-Dairi said that ""groups associated with Boko Haram have been detained"" in Libya and spoke of a ""dreadful terrorist network between IS in Syria and Iraq, [partners] in Libya and Mali, and Boko Haram."" That may suggest the emergence of a broader front stretching from northern Nigeria through the Sahel to the Mediterranean. Boko Haram fighters already have experience in that region: a number joined the Islamist insurgency which seized the northern half of Mali in 2012 before being driven out by a French-led intervention force. Boko Haram already has a sophisticated smuggling network that reaches far beyond Nigeria -- into Cameroon, Niger and Chad -- and taking advantage of poorly policed borders. Zenn, who is an analyst at the Jamestown Foundation, says the fact that Afriqiyah Media released recent messages may itself be ominous. He says it ""is closely affiliated to Tunisian jihadist brigades that already pledged loyalty to Islamic State in 2014."" ""Given ISIS penetration in Tunisia and Libya, and Boko Haram's logistical connections to North Africa,"" says Zenn, ""it would not be surprising if North African jihadists helped make the segue between ISIS in Iraq and Syria and Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria."" Further evidence of ISIS sympathizers in Tunisia emerged Monday, when the Tunisian Interior Ministry announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists, and published a video allegedly showing the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of al-Baghdadi. It's estimated that between 2,500 and 3,000 Tunisians have traveled to Iraq and Syria, most to join ISIS. Another part of Boko Haram's strategy that may borrow from ISIS is its concentration on creating its own space either side of international borders. Just as ISIS has carved out its ""Caliphate"" on both sides of the Syrian-Iraq border, so Boko Haram has focused on Borno state, which borders both Cameroon and Chad. Shekau has castigated (as has ISIS) the colonial-era borders separating Muslims, saying once: ""We don't know Cameroon or Chad... I don't have a country."" And earlier this month he declared in another video: ""O people of Cameroon! O people of Chad! Repent to Allah the Almighty. Know that one cannot be a Muslim but by disavowing democracy."" Once seen as an exclusively Nigerian movement, Boko Haram's horizons are broadening to the north and east, prompting closer military co-operation by the governments of Nigeria, Chad and Cameroon, whose latest offensive appears to be putting Boko Haram on the defensive in some parts of the border region. When and whether there will be a formal alliance between Boko Haram and ISIS is still very much open to debate -- but at the very least the Nigerian group's shifting priorities, behavior and presentation is another sign of ISIS' far-reaching influence among jihadist groups. What is Boko Haram?","Boko Haram and ISIS share an apocalyptic ""end-of-days"" vision, writes Tim Lister .

"Chris Kyle had no regrets about any of the 160 people he killed as a Navy SEAL sniper during his five combat tours in Iraq. His first kill was a woman who cradled a toddler with one hand and held a grenade in the other. ""I had to do it to protect the Marines,"" Kyle told Time magazine a year ago. ""You want to lose your own guys, or would you rather take one of them out?"" Standing 6 feet, 2 inches tall and weighing a muscular 220 pounds, Kyle developed a deadly reputation in Iraq, prompting insurgents to put a bounty on his head, according to his autobiography. ""I'm a better husband and father than I was a killer,"" he told Time. ""I'm pretty comfortable with not having to kill anyone. Now, don't take deer hunting away from me."" When Kyle's military career ended after a decade, he joined other former SEALs to start Craft International, a security company with the motto ""Despite what your momma told you, Violence does solve problems."" He also became a best-selling author, a reality TV personality, a supporter of fellow vets suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, an avid hunter and an outspoken opponent of gun control. Kyle, 38, was shot to death Saturday -- by a former Marine, police say -- while shooting for fun on a Texas gun range. Another man was also fatally shot. A west Texas native, Kyle studied agriculture at Tarleton State University in Stephenville, Texas, after graduating from high school in 1992. He left college after two years to work as a ranch hand until he joined the Navy in 1999. He left the Navy as a chief petty officer in 2009 with a chest full of medals, including two Silver Stars and five Bronze Stars, according to his service record released by the Pentagon. It was another distinction accumulated during Kyle's five tours of Iraq that has brought him the most attention.  He wrote about it in a best-selling book published a year ago, titled  ""American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History."" Should vets with PTSD, mental illness still have access to guns? Although the military does not release such statistics, the book claimed Kyle had 160 confirmed combat kills from a distance of up to 2,100 yards.  He holds the record for a U.S. military sniper, previously set at 93 by Marine sniper Carlos Hathcock during the Vietnam war. Kyle seemed humble during a guest appearance to promote his book on TBS' ""Conan"" last year. ""I had more kills, but that doesn't mean I'm better than (Hathcock) is,"" Kyle said.  ""I was just put into a position where I had more opportunities.  I definitely cheated.  I used a ballistic computer that tells me everything to do.  So, I was just a monkey on a gun."" He showed O'Brien a sense of humor when talking about the $80,000 bounty placed on his head by Iraqi insurgents.  ""I was worried about my wife coming home, because I thought my wife would turn me in,"" he joked. Kyle modestly acknowledged to the Time interviewer that he was ""decent"" at killing. ""The first time killing someone, you're not even sure you can do it,"" he said.  ""You think you can, but you never know until you actually are put in that position and you do it. ... And then, you're worried when you get home, are the politicians going to hang you out to dry and put you on trial for murder?"" Did he regret any of his 160 kills?  ""No, not at all,"" he told Time. Kyle's opinion of the American public's ability to understand war was poor. ""For the most part, the public is very soft, you live in a dream world,"" he said.  ""You have no idea what goes on the other side of the world, the harsh realities of what these people are doing to themselves and then to our guys.  There are certain things that need to be done to take care of them."" His combat persona, though, could be turned on and off, he said. ""You're a little more aggressive when you're at work and when you come home, you relax and try to be the different person,"" he said. Kyle helped established the FITCO Cares foundation, a charity that helps U.S. war vets ""who have survived combat but are still fighting to survive post-traumatic stress disorder,"" the group's website said. Life back home was a challenge for Kyle, who acknowledged that he turned to alcohol for comfort at one point.  ""After I was discharged from the military, it was difficult trying to become a civilian,"" he told a lawyer during a deposition for a lawsuit last November. ""You're in a combat zone one day,"" he said.  ""You come home, and then you have to readjust, and it takes a few days.  We just sit in the house, hang with the family and then things get better.  But it's simple things of trash blowing across the road, reminded of an (improvised explosive device), you might want to swerve.  So that's why you just stay at home."" Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura filed a lawsuit last year accusing Kyle of defaming him in the book by exaggerating his description of a fight between the two at the wake for SEAL Mikey Monsoor, who was killed in Iraq in 2006. How the violent mentally ill can buy guns . The book quoted Ventura, also a Navy veteran, as saying he ""hates America"" and telling Kyle, who was mourning the death of a SEAL teammate, ""You deserve to lose a few.""  Kyle described punching Ventura out at the Coronado, California, bar. In the suit, Ventura denied making the statements in the book, contending that ""the entire story about a confrontation with and physical assault and battery of Governor Ventura was false and defamatory."" At his deposition last November, Kyle continued to insist his book accurately described his clash with Ventura. ""He was complaining about the war, that we shouldn't be there,"" Kyle testified.  ""Complaining about Bush, that, you know, Bush was a war criminal.  How we were killing innocent men and women and children overseas."" Kyle acknowledged in his deposition saying that he hated Ventura ""with a passion."" His relationship with another politician was warmer.  His company did some security work for former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, whom he met while on the ""Stars Earn Stripes"" reality TV show with her husband, Todd. ""Chris was a wonderful man, a good friend, and a true American hero who loved our country and served honorably. He was loved and admired by so many, and he will never be forgotten,"" the Palins said in a statement Sunday. Much of Kyle's time since leaving the military was spent building Craft International, which offers military training for law enforcement and provides security services. His company also organizes ""civilian and corporate shoots"" at gun ranges, he said.  ""It is only fun day shoots, self-defense, or weapons familiarization,"" he said. In a Guns.com interview at a gun dealers convention in Las Vegas last month, Kyle was asked about President Barack Obama's gun control proposals, which he said he believed to be aimed at ""trying to ban everything."" Banning 30-round magazines for assault rifles would be ""opening the door to start taking more of our rights,"" he said. Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. CNN's Nick Valencia and John Branch contributed to this report.","Kyle was fatally shot at a Texas gun range by a former Marine Saturday, police say .

"Mohammed Merah, 23, suspected in seven recent killings, remained holed up Thursday in an apartment in the southern French city of Toulouse, more than 24 hours after hundreds of officers lay siege. Police continued to demand the surrender of the self-proclaimed jihadist. Merah is wanted in the killings of three French paratroopers and of three students and a rabbi at a Jewish school in Toulouse, in a string of shootings that began on March 11. He opened fire on police as they tried to break down his apartment door about 3:30 a.m. Wednesday, wounding two officers, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said. Wednesday evening, police switched off the street lights in the district around the apartment, leading to speculation that a new raid was imminent as talks stalled. Three loud explosions and flashes of light erupted shortly before midnight -- but Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre Henry Brandet told CNN the blasts were meant to pressure Merah back into talks with negotiators, and police had not moved in on the apartment. Around 12:30 a.m. Thursday (7:30 p.m. Wednesday ET), a police convoy left the scene with what appeared to be someone huddled beneath a blanket in the back seat of one of the cars. But there was no sign the siege was breaking up, and two more explosions rang out about an hour later. Merah told French police that he trained with al Qaeda in Pakistan's Waziristan region, bordering Afghanistan, and that he planned to attack more soldiers and police Wednesday, Molins said. He said he was acting alone, the prosecutor added. Ebba Kalondo, the senior news editor of the television network France 24, told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that the suspect had called her about two hours before police arrived at his residence and laid out details of the killings that only police would have known -- ""very, very specific information"" such as the number of shots fired and the shell casings left behind. ""He seemed to be very aware that a massive manhunt was under way for him,"" Kalondo said. ""He said he wasn't scared, and that neither capture nor death scared him at all."" Hours into the siege, French President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke at a memorial service for the three paratroopers, calling their killing ""a terrorist execution."" One of the victims was due to become a father soon, but ""a killer without scruples decided that he would never meet the child to be born,"" Sarkozy said. Earlier Wednesday, Sarkozy called on his nation ""to unite together to show that terrorism will not be able to fracture our national community."" Sarkozy's office said U.S. President Barack Obama had called his French counterpart to offer his condolences and praise the efforts of French police. France and the United States are more determined than ever to fight together against terrorist brutality, Sarkozy's office said. Officials worry about ""lone wolf"" terrorists . Merah had been under surveillance by French intelligence for years, Interior Minister Claude Gueant said. He had ""already committed certain infractions, some with violence,"" Gueant said. Merah was sentenced 15 times by a Toulouse juvenile court when he was a minor, Molins said. He was back in a Toulouse court February 24 for causing an accident with injuries and driving without a license and was sentenced to a month in jail, his lawyer Christian Etelin said on BFM-TV. He had not begun serving that sentence, Etelin said. The attorney also said Merah went to Afghanistan two years ago. He was sent back to France after Afghan police picked him up at a traffic stop and alerted international forces to his presence, Molins said. The French defense ministry said Merah had twice tried to join the French military. His first attempt was in the northern city of Lille, where he was refused because of prior convictions, and his second, in July 2010, was in Toulouse, where he sought to join the Foreign Legion but left during the first round of tests. Gueant said in Toulouse on Wednesday that he expected Merah to give himself up, but the standoff continued. At one point, a handgun was thrown from the window of the apartment, but the minister said the suspect had other weapons, as well as a car containing more arms near his apartment. Merah broke off communications with police late in the morning, Gueant said, but started talking again several hours later, a police officer said. The suspect was being stubborn and difficult to talk to, said Didier Martinez, a Toulouse police press officer. Who is Mohammed Merah? Merah was born in Toulouse, said Elisabeth Allanic, a magistrate at the Paris prosecutors office. Gueant said he was of Algerian origin. Gueant said Merah ""wanted to avenge Palestinian children and take revenge on the French army because of its foreign interventions."" France has about 4,000 troops supporting the NATO mission in Afghanistan. The government has said it will pull them out by 2013. Merah also was opposed to France's recent move to ban women from wearing a full veil, or burqa, Molins said. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad strongly rejected using his people as a justification for the French killings, calling them a ""cowardly terrorist attack."" ""It is time for those criminals to stop exploiting the name of Palestine through their terrorist actions,"" Fayyad said in a statement Wednesday. The suspect belongs to a group called Forsane Alizza, or Knights of Glory, Gueant said. The French government banned the group in January for trying to recruit people to fight in Afghanistan. The group issued a ""chilling warning"" on its Facebook page before it was banned this year, calling on supporters to attack Americans, Jews and French soldiers, terror expert Sajjan Gohel said. Police tracked the suspect down via his brother's computer IP address, which was apparently used to respond to an ad posted by the first victim, Gueant said. Imad Ibn Ziaten, a paratrooper of North African origin, arranged to meet a man in Toulouse to sell him a scooter he had advertised online, the minister said. The victim said in the ad that he was in the military. A message sent from the suspect's brother's IP address was used to set up an appointment to inspect the bike, an appointment at which the paratrooper was killed March 11, Gueant said. Four days later, two other soldiers were shot dead and another injured by a black-clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in a shopping center in the city of Montauban, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Toulouse. In the attack at the private Jewish school Ozar Hatorah on Monday, a man wearing a motorcycle helmet and driving a motor scooter pulled up and shot a teacher and three children -- two of them the teacher's young sons -- in the head. The other victim, the daughter of the school's director, was killed in front of her father. Police, who said the same guns were used in all three attacks, launched an intense manhunt and late Tuesday night zeroed in on the apartment, about 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) from the Jewish school. Meanwhile, the bodies of the four victims in the school shooting arrived in Israel, where they were buried in Jerusalem. Why are Jewish dead flown to Israel for burials? ""Today, all Israel is in pain and mourning over the deaths of innocent children and a dedicated father,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon told the families as the coffins were lowered from the plane. The teacher, Rabbi Jonathan Sandler, was born and raised in Bordeaux, in southwestern France, but pursued his religious studies in Israel. He married and had children before returning to teach at the Toulouse school, French Jewish representatives said.  His sons, Gabriel, 4, and Arieh, 5, were buried with him. The other victim, 7-year-old Miriam Monsonego, was buried separately on Wednesday. Forty percent of French practicing Jews are buried in Israel, according to the Consistory of Paris, a group representing Jewish communities. The U.S.-based Muslim Public Affairs Council condemned the French attacks ""in the strongest terms possible,"" in a statement Wednesday. The group's president, Salam Al-Marayati, said: ""(We) call upon the people of France to come together and not allow their national resilience to be impacted by these acts of terror.""","Siege has lasted more than 24 hours .

"Opening in 1863, London has the world's oldest underground railway but it also has, in austerely beautiful Westminster, one of Europe's most futuristic-looking stations. The first metro might have been uncomfortable and unhealthy (toxic steam often entered the train cars due to poor ventilation) but it soon became clear that few cities of any size should be without one. By the mid-1920s, Paris, Madrid, Berlin and Milan had their own subterranean networks -- with cleaner, electric-powered trains and often also beating London's Tube in the aesthetic appeal of their stations. Moscow joined the party in 1935 and now boasts one of the busiest metro systems in the world -- carrying more than 6.5 million passengers a day. But as the following stations show, more than 150 years after the London Underground opened, there's a lot more to a great subway stop than getting from A to B. 1. Toledo, Naples, Italy . Opened in 2012, Toledo station defies its depth -- at 50 meters, one of the deepest in Naples -- with a design based around themes of light and water. A work called ""Light Panels"" by Robert Wilson illuminates the station corridor furthest underground. This stunning station has competition: it's part of the city's network of so-called Metro Art Stations. 2. Westfriedhof, Munich, Germany . Inaugurated in 1998 to little fanfare, this otherwise ordinary looking station took on new life just three years later. In 2001, Westfriedhof's platform was aesthetically enhanced by 11 enormous, domed lighting fixtures that continuously bathe the surroundings in haunting shades of blue, yellow and red. 3. Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya Line), Moscow . Komsomolskaya station's baroque-style decor, historical mosaics and chandeliered ceilings resemble a grand ballroom. Opened in 1952 to alleviate the congestion of one of Moscow's busiest transport hubs, it was Stalin's infamous 1941 wartime speech that inspired the opulence of the mosaics. 4. Olaias, Lisbon, Portugal . In 1998, Lisbon hosted a world expo, in part to celebrate 500 years of Portuguese inventions. Built to help transport the expo's 11 million visitors, the station is a whimsically colorful space that to this day holds its own as a modern work of art. 5. Westminster, London . London Underground might be the great-great-grandparent of all the world's metro stations but Westminster, opened just days before the new millennium, has to be one of the most futuristic-looking. The austere concrete and stainless steel design somehow achieves a functional beauty rather than oppressing all those commuters scurrying to and from their offices. 6. T-Centralen, Stockholm, Sweden . Above ground, Stockholm's central station looks like a pretty average part of a rapid transit system. Start boring down, though, and unexpected changes in color and shape reveal a very different animal. When commuters reach the bold blue and white, cave-like platform at T-Centralen, they're reminded that they've indeed ventured underground. 7. Bockenheimer Warte, Frankfurt, Germany . Seeking to distinguish his design from the unobtrusive minimalism of other Frankfurt stations, architect Zbigniew Peter Pininski outdid himself with the fantastical entrance to Bockenheimer Warte. Depicting a train car crashing through the sidewalk, it leaves commuters either shocked or bemused, but rarely indifferent. 8. ""Fosteritos,"" Bilbao, Spain . Less than 20 years old, Bilbao's metro is the third-largest in Spain. The curved-glass entrances of many of the stations -- affectionately nicknamed ""Fosteritos"" (""Little Fosters"") after their creator, Lord Foster -- are considered prime examples of the city's modern, up-to-the-minute style. The transparent structures admit plenty of daytime light and at night are lit up. 9. Palais Royal -- Musée du Louvre, Paris . In a city as beautiful as Paris, this unconventional station entrance at Place Colette still stands out. Completed in 2000 (the centennial year of the Paris metro), Jean-Michel Othoniel's ""Kiosque des noctambules"" (""Kiosk of the night owls"") intertwines dazzling colored beads to form two protective cupolas. A meeker design would be overshadowed by the close proximity of the Louvre Museum and surrounding classic architecture. In this case, however, it adds a touch of cheeky hipness. 10. Admiralteyskaya, St. Petersburg, Russia . St. Petersburg's newest metro stop proves that classic and modern design can coexist harmoniously. After many setbacks, the station finally opened for business in December 2011. Stark curved ceilings and low lighting complement traditional marble and arched platforms in what's the deepest station in the network. 11. Plac Wilsona, Warsaw, Poland . The Soviets built some extraordinary metro stations but this 2005 effort, named after U.S. president Woodrow Wilson, showed that a capitalist Poland could come up with some beauties, too. Unless, as might appear, it was actually built by UFOs. 12. Staromestska, Prague . All the stations on Prague's A Line deserve a place in the European metro hall of fame for their distinctive dimpled metal tunnel walls, but Staromestska is the most visited and photographed. A different color for each station, they look like something from the dystopian film ""A Clockwork Orange,"" but the bubble-wrap design actually strengthens the metal.

"On a fall night two years ago, Jackie, the alleged victim of a brutal gang rape, recounted her story in vivid detail to two friends. She recalled the assault for Ryan Duffin and Alex Stock on picnic tables at the quaint University of Virginia campus. ""Her lips were quivering and (she) looked like somebody who had just been through some really traumatic experience,"" said Duffin, who met Jackie through a mutual friend at orientation. ""I've never seen anyone look like that before. I really hope I never have to see anyone look like that again."" They sat outside a freshman dorm as she told of the shocking sexual assault, according to the friends. This was long before her account of the attack appeared in a now infamous Rolling Stone article published on November 19. That harrowing account described how Jackie was lured to a fraternity house and allegedly raped by seven men at a Phi Kappa Psi party. The article sparked international outrage and portrayed the University of Virginia's response as cold and even tolerant of such horrific  behavior. Several weeks later, the magazine published an apology that raised questions about the authenticity of the story. Duffin and Stock told CNN they remember a starkly different account than what appeared in Rolling Stone. Their version cast doubt over whether the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack even existed. ""I mean there are definitely some major holes in the story,"" said Stock, who also met Jackie through a mutual friend at summer orientation. ""I think that that was pretty clear in the Rolling Stone piece... It was almost too perfect of a story."" Jackie's lawyer declined to comment to CNN for this article. In its apology, Rolling Stone said of Jackie, ""Our trust in her was misplaced."" The magazine later removed those words in an updated statement and said of its reporting errors, ""These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie."" The magazine admitted that its writer had not contacted the man who allegedly brought about the attack. It said the writer didn't contact any of the men that Jackie claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation. Duffin and Stock said they were never contacted by the magazine; instead, the writer portrayed them through Jackie's eyes. ""Rolling Stone is conducting a thorough internal review of the reporting, editing, and fact-checking of Sabrina Rubin Erdely's 'A Rape on Campus,"" the magazine said in a statement Tuesday. If Jackie, who supposedly had a crush on Duffin, was indeed raped by the man her friends say went on a date with Jackie on the night of September 28, 2012, his behavior was more brazen that originally thought. CNN has obtained text messages and an email from the man who Jackie said lured her to the frat house, including one sent to Duffin days after the alleged assault. Bombshell rape story triggers weeks of turmoil at the University of Virginia . Was Haven Monahan a real person? Since summer orientation in 2012, Stock, Duffin and another freshman, Kathryn Hendley, had become friends with Jackie. Duffin said Jackie was much more interested in him than he in her. He said he was happy when Jackie told friends that an upperclassman in her chemistry class asked her on a date. Duffin and Stock decided to learn more about the upperclassman and check to ""see if he's OK,"" Duffin said. Jackie gave them the phone number for the man, whom she identified as Haven Monahan. Stock and Duffin said they sent him text messages and pretended to be another student from chemistry class. Monahan purportedly texted back, saying of Jackie, ""I really like her,"" and describing her as ""super smart .. hot"" and liking the same music as he. At one point, he even sent a photo of himself. Duffin never suspected Monahan may not be a real person. ""No,"" Duffin said, ""at the time, it all seemed very real."" Jackie said she went on a date with Monahan the evening in late September 2012, when Rolling Stone reported that she was raped. Late that night, Jackie called Duffin. ""She just said something bad had happened and could I come meet her,"" he recalled. Duffin and Stock met her outside the first-year dorms. They sat at the picnic tables. ""It looked like she had been crying,"" Duffin remembered. ""She was shaking... obviously just scared about something. And it looked like she thought somebody might just pop out of the dark and just grab her or something."" Jackie told her two friends that her date parked in front of the fraternity house, Duffin said. The man told her he had to go up to his room and asked whether she wanted to join him. She went with him. ""She then said that when she went into the house and went up the stairs, her date locked the door of the room once they got in there,"" Duffin said. ""And she said that there were five other men in the room who she was then forced to perform oral sex on."" Stock said she was very upset. Friends saw inconsistencies in story . ""I didn't have any doubts that what she said happened had happened,"" he said. But details of the assault chronicled in Rolling Stone didn't match what Jackie told her friends, the two men said. In the article, for instance, she graphically describes a brutal gang rape by seven men instead of five. Oral sex was not mentioned. The article described her date as a man named ""Drew"" who she met ""while working lifeguard shifts together at the university pool."" In 2012, she told her friends his name was ""Haven"" and they had met in chemistry class. The inconsistencies did not end there, according to Duffin and Stock. The article described how she was beaten, struck about the face and left barefoot and bloodied. That's not what her friends remember. ""I didn't notice any sort of physical injuries,"" Duffin said. ""I didn't notice a lack of shoes. I really didn't notice anything that was consistent with the physical description that was in the article."" Said Stock, ""If there had been major injuries the way the article portrays, I think I would have remembered that."" A major criticism of the Rolling Stone article, titled ""A Rape on Campus: A Brutal Assault and Search for Justice at UVA,"" was that the reporter did not seek comment from the alleged attackers. Discrepancies in the account were later reported by The Washington Post and other news outlets. For instance, Phi Kappa Psi did not have a party the night Jackie said the rape occurred; the man she identified as her date that night was not a member of that fraternity. Perhaps the biggest discrepancy was the Rolling Stone article's portrayal of how her friends reacted to news of the sexual assault: ""The three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting Jackie's rape while Jackie stood beside them, mute in her bloody dress."" The article quoted Cindy, whose was actually Hendley, saying: ""Her reputation will be shot for the next four years."" Duffin and Stock said that Hendley wasn't even part of the conversation. Jackie didn't want the female friend to hear what happened. Kathryn waited about 25 feet away from the picnic table as Jackie spoke with her two male friends. ""That conversation never happened,"" said Duffin. ""That whole entire conversation about debating the social price of reporting a rape, and any sort of detriment to a reputation that might come around from reporting a rape, absolutely never happened."" Hendley told CNN she was not part of the initial conversation. ""The things she said about me were completely off,"" Hendley said of Jackie. ""It was a powerful part of the story, but it wasn't true."" They say Jackie didn't want to call police . The two friends said they tried desperately to convince Jackie to call the police. She decided against it, they said. ""I was really forceful in wanting to call the police,"" Duffin said. ""I brought up the point a few times. But the reason we didn't call the police was because Jackie didn't want to. She didn't want to have to go through ... constant interrogation by police officers which would cause her to continually relive this traumatic event."" The two friends said they slept on the floor of Jackie's dorm to help her get through the night. Five days later, Duffin said he inexplicably received an email titled ""About You"" from Haven, the man allegedly behind the alleged sexual assault.  (When CNN tried the email address, the message came back ""undeliverable."") ""It was from Haven Monahan ... and it looked like Haven had written, 'You should read this, I've never read anything nicer in my life,' with a page worth -- an essay -- that Jackie had written about me,"" Duffin said. ""Which seemed really weird to me, even at the time, because here's somebody who allegedly just led a brutal sexual assault on a friend of mine, and now he's going to email me this thing about me?"" Jackie told her friends that Monahan dropped out of the university after the assault, but a university record check by CNN revealed that no one by that name ever attended the university. Another check found no one by that name in the United States. The photo Monahan supposedly sent Duffin via text message matched that of a man who went to high school with Jackie in Stafford, Virginia. ""There's a very good chance whoever I was texting was Jackie,"" Stock said. ""There's a definite possibility."" Jackie and her three friends drifted apart long before the Rolling Stone article, though her friends believe something bad may have happened to her that September night. ""I think it's very possible, yeah,"" Duffin said. ""I still think it's extremely, extremely possible. If only because the reaction she had on that night seemed so strong, and seemed so genuine, that I still think it's difficult to believe that she would have been acting.""","Friends of victim in UVA rape story paint different picture of alleged assault .

"(CNN)It has all the makings of a Bollywood blockbuster: a beautiful leading lady, an ukulele-toting hero and more than three hours of dancing across locations in India, London and the Swiss Alps. ""Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge,"" which is also known as DDLJ and translates as ""The Brave-Hearted Will Take Away The Bride,"" has been on the big screen for an unprecedented 1,009 weeks -- nearly 20 years -- at Mumbai's Maratha Mandir theater. The longest-running film in Indian movie history, the 189-minute romantic comedy is about a young Indian couple from London who meet during a road trip around Europe. Simran, who is from a strict, conservative family, is due to be married off to a husband in India, when a Raj, a young hot head, pursues her. After much singing, dancing and serenading across fields of poppies, they fall head over heels in love -- despite opposition from their families. Much of DDLJ's enduring success is down to the movie's young leading actress, Kajol, who plays Simran. A virtual unknown when the film released in 1995, she's now Bollywood royalty -- known as much for her very distinctive eyebrows as her singing and dancing. Then there's Kajol's co-star Shah Rukh Khan, who plays as Raj. Now one of the most famous men in the world, he played a cheesy, over-the-top kid with a fancy car and charming dimples. Barely a blip on the Bollywood radar back then, Khan's career was defined by the first notes from his character's ukulele, which wafted through a field of yellow flowers as Kajol -- wearing hot pink lipstick -- ran towards him with the urgency of a woman in love. 'Spontaneous outcry' So when the Maratha Mandir theater decided to end the Yash Raj Film production's two-decade run on its big screen, it caused an uproar among many Mumbai residents. Yash Raj put out a statement on its website titled ""DDLJ Forever!"" on February 19. The production company and the movie theater explained to the public that it had been ""mutually decided to end the film's historic and record breaking run."" The announcement triggered what The Times of India described as ""a spontaneous and an overwhelming outcry from the cinema going audience."" The Maratha Mandir theater told CNN by phone that it had ""received hundreds upon hundreds of calls"" the day the end of the film's historic run was announced. Fans also took to the movie's official website posting messages like: ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge -- Official will no more be running in Martha Mandir!!! I really had a wish to go and fall in love once there ... A part of my dream dies today!!"" Another said, ""Ouch! This was not expected. Some legends are too good to come to an end ... at least not without a warning! Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge -- Official comes to a halt!"" So -- after only two days -- the decision was reversed and Yash Raj invited movie lovers to ""Come fall in love ... again and again,"" as the movie's tag line goes. 'Absolute nostalgia' The scale of the Bollywood film industry -- the word's most prolific -- is truly staggering: the government estimates the industry produces more than 1,200 feature films a year, while approximately 15 million Indians fill cinemas daily. At this point, there are not even enough cinemas to screen these films. Even U.S. President Obama quoted, or tried to quote, a famous line from DDLJ during his visit to India last month, while discussing the economy and aid packages with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Senorita, bade bade deshon mein ..."" he started to say, before trailing off with: ""you know what I mean."" Last year when the film marked 1,000 weeks on screen, Shah Rukh Khan paid homage to his character by tweeting a picture of himself carrying his backpack from the movie with the caption: ""Tried my 20 yrs later Raj look. The bag and me is original from the film.... the smile is from today for a 1000 weeks!"" Kajol, meanwhile, in November tweeted stills from the movie with an emphatic: ""Re-living #DDLJ! Absolute nostalgia!!!"" The movie's return to the big screen means that now -- at 11.30 a.m. every day - Mumbai's film aficionados can share that nostalgia, once again falling under the spell of some truly classic crooning Bollywood-style.","""Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge"" released in 1995 and is India's longest running film .

"(CNN)I hate the term ""age appropriate."" At 53 I will dress as I like, thank you. So, please, fashion mags, clothing stores and Hollywood, stop with the ""how to dress in your 20s, 30s, 40s and beyond"" nonsense. J.Crew is the latest to inform me, that at my advanced age, short shorts are not for me. (And I thought legs were the last to go.) I love J.Crew. I shop there all the time precisely because they sell clothes I want to wear. Now I have to shop there knowing I dare not go near certain clothes because, well,  this is how a very attractive, older J.Crew lady put it: ""In my 20's, I wore rollneck sweaters with short shorts. A lot has changed since then. Some 20-plus years later, I still love J.Crew, just...differently."" I never realized. But, then again, J.Crew isn't alone when it comes to schooling older ladies on what they should or shouldn't bare. Oprah.com, way back in 2010, helpfully pointed out ""women of a certain age"" should NEVER wear mini-skirts with Uggs, never expose their stomach, never, never wear tube tops, absolutely no shredded denim and, for goodness sakes, no neon nail polish because ""as you age, skin gets more sallow."" Thanks Adam Glassman! Guess I'll cross Uggs off the list! I am still a tad confused, though, by a People magazine spread a few months back that featured ""sexy grandmas!"" (yes, there was an exclamation point!) It featured a 68-year-old Goldie Hawn exposing her cleavage. Does that mean I can expose my grandchildren to my two best friends, but not my thighs? Perhaps this trend started with the best of intentions. But after having total strangers instruct me through the years to dress sexy, not slutty, in my 20s, to avoid mom-jeans in my 30s, to find a ""signature look"" in my 40s and to throw out my Uggs in my 50s -- I am done! And while I'm at it, I'm done with the ""she looks great -- and holy sh--, she's 45!"" Jennifer Lopez is 45, but she looked beautiful at the Oscars Sunday night ... period. No age qualifier necessary. And, guess what? Her gown, with the deep, plunging neckline was awesomely appropriate even if it would never be included in the ""beyond"" category. Recently I had a conversation with a young male friend who was lambasting a ""nearly 60-year-old"" Madonna for exposing her bare rear end at the Grammys. ""Don't worry,"" I said. ""That wasn't for you."" Madonna was simply doing what she's always done -- sending a message to women that it's okay to express your sexuality. I don't think I convinced him. But, that's okay. I have my own opinions. And that includes looking in the mirror and thinking, damn, I look great in these short shorts.","Carol Costello: J.Crew ad advises older women to wear 'age-appropriate' clothes. Spare me .

"(CNN)It was the opportunity of a lifetime for a young Ghanaian boy -- a scholarship to study medicine in Guyana. But his journey didn't go quite as expected. Emmanuel Akomanyi couldn't get a direct flight to Guyana so he boarded a plane in Ghana to Guarulhos International Airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil. There, he bought a ticket to his final destination in Guyana -- a South American country on the Caribbean coast bordering Surinam, Venezuela and Brazil. But when he got off the plane, he was not in Guyana -- he was in the city of Goiania, Brazil -- almost 3,000 kilometers away from where he needed to go. Akomanyi spent a week in Brazil, supported by strangers as he had no money. The airline that sold him the original ticket eventually helped him out with a new flight to Guyana's Cheddi Jagan International Airport, near the capital Georgetown. You'd think with all the technology at our disposal, destination mix-ups like what Akomanyi experienced would be a rarity. Not so. They're surprisingly common. In June of 2014, a couple boarded a plane to the southern Caribbean island of Grenada, instead of their desired destination -- the ancient city of Granada, Spain. U.S. dentist Edward Gamson thought he'd bought tickets from London's Gatwick Airport to Granada, Spain, for himself and his partner via a British Airways booking agent, but only realized he was actually headed to Grenada in the Caribbean once on board, reported The Independent. The destination country and flight duration hadn't been listed on his e-tickets, which instead displayed only the city name. ""It's just so sad,"" Gamson told The Independent. ""A trip we had been really looking forward to was ruined and ... BA won't do the decent thing."" Gamson claimed the airline refused to reimburse his first-class tickets and didn't reroute the travelers to Granada from Grenada. He ended up suing British Airways for the cost of the trip, including planned tours in Spain that he and his partner didn't get to take, but the case was reportedly dismissed. Remarkably, the same mix-up happened earlier that same month. Lamenda Kingdon from Plymouth, UK, had also booked a British Airways flight to Granada, Spain, but found herself on a flight bound for Grenada in the Caribbean. She'd planned the trip after being diagnosed with cancer. When notified of the mistake, the BA crew moved Kingdon to first class and sent her back to Gatwick when the flight made a scheduled stop in St. Lucia, reported the Daily Mail. ""I genuinely don't blame anyone,"" she told the Daily Mail. ""The person on the other end of the phone probably just misheard me. I honestly didn't notice the spelling difference."" In May 2013, Sandy Valdivieso and her husband, Triet Vo, boarded a Turkish Airlines flight in Los Angeles, intending to travel to Dakar, Senegal, in western Africa, but ended up in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The mix-up was due to the similar sounding destinations and airport codes. The couple didn't realize the error until they were already on their connecting flight from Istanbul. ""When the flight attendant said we were heading to Dhaka, we believed that this was how you pronounced 'Dakar' with a Turkish accent,"" Valdivieso told the LA Times. In December 2013, 85-year-old Maria Nieves ended up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after she'd booked a Southwest Airlines flight to Fort Myers, Florida. It was the second time such a mix-up had happened to her -- two years ago, the airline flew Nieves to Tampa, Florida, instead of New Orleans, Louisiana. According to Louisiana's WAFB, Nieves had requested wheelchair assistance, which meant airline staff were responsible for assisting her from gate to gate. ""I can see it happening once, but twice to the same person, it's kind of like lightning striking twice in the same place,"" her son Robert Ortiz told WAFB. Last June, a VietJet Air plane that took off from Hanoi landed at the wrong airport. Instead of arriving in Cam Ranh Airport near Nha Trang, the aircraft landed 140 kilometers away in Da Lat. The airline flew the misdirected passengers to their original destination via another flight, reported local news outlet Thanh Nien News. In January earlier that year, another Southwest Airlines plane landed at a small airport in Taney County, Missouri, approximately seven miles from where it was meant to land at Branson Airport. Due to the difference in airport runway lengths -- Taney County airport's runway is 3,738 feet compared with Branson Airport's 7,140 feet -- pilots were forced to brake hard when the plane touched down. No one was hurt and the airline refunded all tickets and provided future travel credit for passengers.

"(CNN)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's open conflict with U.S. President Barack Obama over his diplomacy with Iran has not only served a blow to the U.S.-Israeli relationship. It has also collapsed Israel's otherwise arguably successful Iran policy. Contrary to Israel's rhetoric, the fear of Iran getting a nuclear weapon has not been the driving factor of Israel policy on Iran since the early 1990s. Obviously, Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon would be highly undesirable for Israel. But that has not been Israel's primary concern. Rather, the fear has been that Washington would end up finding a compromise with Iran that on the one hand would close off any Iranian path to a bomb, but on the other hand would lock in a shift in the regional balance of power in Israel's disfavor. Regardless of the details of a nuclear deal with Iran, a deal per se would reduce Washington's tensions with Tehran, while not necessarily tempering the Israeli-Iranian rivalry proportionally. Israel will be ""abandoned"" to face Iran alone, Israelis fear. Moreover, a deal would signal, the argument goes, that Washington has accepted and will not contest Iran's geopolitical advances in the region. Iran has hegemonic aspirations, Israel contends, and must be stopped, not accommodated. After a deal with Iran, Washington would be even more likely to shift its geopolitical focus elsewhere and be less intertwined with Israel's needs. The U.S.-Iran enmity has ensured Washington's commitment to isolating and containing Iran, much to Israel's satisfaction. If your interest dictates that the U.S. and Iran must remain firmly at odds with each other, a nuclear deal -- any deal -- would eliminate the most explosive point of contention between Washington and Tehran and lessen America's inclination to confront Iran on other matters, Israel believes. As Israel's Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said earlier this week: ""[E]very deal that will be signed between the West and this messianic and apocalyptic regime will strike a severe blow to Western and Israeli interests."" This also explains why Netanyahu has been contradicting his own intelligence services and exaggerated and misconstrued Iran's nuclear activities. Israel's policy towards Iran and the nuclear issue in the past two decades has rested on a few principles. First, consecutive Israeli governments have been on the forefront of sounding the alarm about Iran, while carefully avoiding making Iran an ""Israeli issue."" At times, Israel has tried to tone down its rhetoric, both to avoid making the nuclear file an Israeli issue, but also to avoid making Israel shine too bright on the Iranian threat radar. When Netanyahu was first elected prime minister, he requested an intelligence assessment of Israel's security environment. The debate was largely on whether Iran or Iraq constituted Israel's greatest external threat. Netanyahu decided to go with the assessment of the Mossad, presented by Uzi Arad, who argued that Israel could either make itself Iran's prime enemy by continuing belligerent rhetoric against Tehran, or it could tone things down and let Iran focus on other threats. ""Until the Netanyahu government, there was a proliferation of Israeli statements trying to deter Iran, warning Iran, the long arm of the Israeli air force etc. That was stopped, to his credit, by Netanyahu,"" Israeli journalist Ehud Yaari told me in an interview for my book Treacherous Alliance - the Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran and the US. Ultimately, Israel was successful at turning the world's focus towards Iran's nuclear activities. The international community, led by Washington, began regarding Iran's nuclear issue as a primary threat to international security, imposed U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran and the U.S. even openly debated bombing the country. But over the course of the past 18 months, the Netanyahu government has made Iran all about Israel. While virtually the entire world is eager for a peaceful nuclear deal, Israel stands alone (bar a few Arab states in the Persian Gulf) in opposing the talks. While Israel helped shape international consensus about Iran's nuclear program in the years past, Israel is today decisively outside of that consensus. Second, while Israel calculated that preventing a U.S.-Iran deal would best serve its interest, it needed to retain the flexibility to shift its position if and when an agreement was likely to be reached. By adopting a more cooperative tone with Washington, Israel's flexibility would enable it to influence the deal and reduce its potential downsides for Israel. For instance, when U.S. President Bill Clinton started sending strong signals to Iran's newly elected reformist president Mohammad Khatami in the late 1990s, then-Prime Minister Ehud Barak softened Israel's tone towards Iran in order to minimize any negative side-effects of a U.S.-Iran deal for Israel. He symbolically reduced Iran from ""enemy"" to ""threat,"" signaling that he didn't see Israeli-Iranian enmity as inevitable. Clinton's outreach to Iran never bore fruit, so Israel never had to deal with its potential repercussions. But Barak signaled his openness and ability to adjust to such a scenario, recognizing that Israel's most important relationship after all was that with United States. But this flexibility has been completely abandoned or lost under Netanyahu's leadership. Ever since Obama took office, Netanyahu has actively sought to first prevent diplomacy, then undermine diplomacy to his current stance of building up opposition to Obama's prospective deal with Tehran. Netanyahu has taken it to an extreme. He has been so disruptive that the Obama administration has felt compelled to reduce information sharing about the negotiations with his government, lest he would leak it to undercut the talks. The more Netanyahu has sought to undermine the talks, the more Israel has lost its ability to impact the negotiations. By now, Netanyahu has crossed the real ""point of no return."" Confidence in him is completely lost in the White House, so he cannot adopt Ehud Barak's posture. His only remaining options is to double down on opposing a nuclear deal with Iran, even at the cost of an open war with the American president, of damaging U.S.-Israel relations beyond Obama, and of making Israel a partisan issue. Such is the logic of adopting extremist positions. Rather than depriving the other side of options and maneuverability, Netanyahu has painted Israel in a corner.","Benjamin Netanyahu's open conflict with President Obama over Iran has served as blow to U.S.-Israeli relationship, says Trita Parsi .

"(CNN)He was an acclaimed film director. She, a 13-year-old girl, working on a modeling job in California. The decision by Roman Polanski to have sex with Samantha Geimer was one that continues to dog him nearly four decades later. ""It was 1977 and I had a modeling job with Roman and at the very end of that he took advantage of me and made me have sex with him,"" Geimer said. At the time, Polanski pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful sex with a minor. But the filmmaker fled the United States before he could be sentenced. Now, after a Polish prosecutor last month asked a regional court in Krakow to consider whether to extradite him to the United States, his case is being heard by a court there. Polanski appeared in court Wednesday to give evidence, following an opening statement from the prosecutor, court spokeswoman Beata Gorszczyk told CNN. The court was closed to the media Wednesday but will be open for any further hearings, she said. CNN's Polish affiliate TVN reported the hearing was later postponed until April. Part of the reason, TVN reported, was the arrival of new documents concerning the United States' attempt to have the director extradited from Switzerland in 2009. Many of the documents, which arrived on Tuesday, are in German, meaning that the Kraków District Court is obliged to translate them. Regardless of the Polish court's eventual ruling, the country's justice minister has the right to veto the decision. The United States called on Poland to extradite Polanski after the director, who survived the Nazi-German occupation of Kraków, attended the grand opening of the Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw in January. The now 81-year-old is subject to an Interpol warrant -- and has successfully avoided arrest and extradition from Canada, France, Israel, Thailand and Switzerland, where he was placed under temporary house arrest in 2009 before the Swiss refused the U.S. request the following year. On more than one occasion, his victim has called for the charges against him to be dropped. ""Polanski went to jail for 42 days,"" Geimer said. ""I never asked anyone to put him in jail for a day and in the scheme of things, from what I have been told, in 1977, 42 days would have been about average. ""However, I think that was a lot, plus he was arrested again and went to jail for months again -- that's way in excess of anything he deserved."" Polanski has also been vocal about the scandal. In the 2008 HBO documentary ""Wanted and Desired,"" he explained his actions. ""Well, I like young women, let's put it this way, and I think most men do actually,"" he said. While on the run, Polanski has continued to make films and win accolades, including an Academy Award for ""The Pianist"" and nominations for ""Tess"" and ""Chinatown."" The famed director has both French and Polish citizenship, and he is working on another movie in Poland, his parents' homeland, this spring. But yet again, he finds himself facing an attempt to have him returned to the United States to answer the decades-old charges.

"(CNN)Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, grappling with accusations that he embellished and/or fabricated reports placing him at the center of dramatic news events, tipped his hand more than he realized by threatening one of the many journalists asking questions about the accuracy of his accounts. ""I am coming after you with everything I have,"" O'Reilly told New York Times reporter Emily Steel. ""You can take it as a threat."" Bad move, Bill. In the real world of tough guys (as opposed to celebrity blowhards), that kind of empty threat only comes from a sore loser -- somebody unable to control or hide his anger, fright and impotence over the fact he has been cornered and beaten.  There is nothing O'Reilly can do to harm The New York Times, its reporters or any other journalist doing their job, and he surely knows that. So why the tantrum? Part of it is O'Reilly's style. He is a fabulously wealthy, best-selling author and the host of a show that has dominated prime-time cable news for many years.  One way he got to the top of the heap was by styling himself as a plain-spoken, working-class battler, willing to mix it up verbally with those who disagree with him. As ex-Rep. Barney Frank -- a gay, outspokenly liberal Democrat who sparred with O'Reilly -- explained to The Daily Beast:   ""When you go on his show, you have two choices: either be reasonable and let him dominate with his ranting, or yell back at him. You either look timid or as boorish as he is."" The verbal fireworks make for a certain kind of TV that can be fun to watch and has proved enormously popular, but it doesn't give O'Reilly a pass to make things up and not get called on it. His dramatic claims to have reported from a war zone during the Falklands conflict -- an account complete with troops firing into crowds, a gun pointed at his head and O'Reilly saving a gravely wounded colleague -- has been disputed by seven of his colleagues who were on assignment in Argentina with him. More recently, reporters have questioned O'Reilly's claim -- printed in his book, ""Killing Kennedy"" -- to have heard the gunshot that killed George de Mohrenschildt, a friend of Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who killed President John Kennedy. Mohrenschildt's death was dramatic, important news: He killed himself in Florida shortly after being contacted by congressional investigators probing the assassination. It's hard to believe that O'Reilly, then working on stories about the assassination for Dallas television station WFAA, would have sat on the news that he was present and heard the shotgun blast that killed Mohrenschildt. Once again, a little probing by journalists turns up evidence from reliable sources that O'Reilly's account is probably false. Jefferson Morley, a former Washington Post editor, has posted audio tapes of O'Reilly talking with a congressional investigator around the time of the incident in conversations that leave little doubt that O'Reilly was in Dallas at the time Mohrenschildt died. ""He was in Dallas"" says Tracy Rowlett, who worked at WFAA at the time, according to the Huffington Post. ""Bill O'Reilly's a phony -- there's no other way to put it."" Sally Quinn, former columnist and veteran Washington insider who is a friend of O'Reilly's, defended him in a way that is less than helpful. ""O'Reilly is an entertainer and everything he does is totally subjective, including his memories,"" she told The Daily Beast.  ""To attack him is simply to increase his ratings and the sales of his phenomenally popular books. Lighten up, everybody."" That's easier said than done, especially after O'Reilly chose to start threatening reporters. His best move now would be to do the difficult, responsible thing, the thing truly great journalists have been doing for decades: admit he screwed up, apologize and try to move on. That might damage his brand as the swaggering no-spin guy, and it might even lose him some viewers.  But it would begin to restore his reputation in a profession that isn't perfect and doesn't expect its practitioners to be -- but also doesn't expect valid questions to be answered with the snarling, empty threats of a coward.","Errol Louis: Bill O'Reilly, accused of fabricating reports, threatened NYT reporter, saying: ""I'm coming after you...""
Louis: He placed himself in stories he was not in, former colleagues say. O'Reilly should come clean, apologize ."
"(CNN)A few weeks ago, metro Atlanta residents gleefully noted that a Georgia groundhog, ahem, failed to see his shadow --  a sure sign of an early Southern spring. Looks like it won't be all that early. Forecasters are calling for a wintry mix of precipitation Wednesday into Thursday from the lower Mississippi Valley to the Carolinas and southern Virginia. Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley declared a state of emergency, with ice, sleet, snow and freezing rain expected in various parts of the state. In North Carolina, Gov. Pat McCrory said he was prepared to declare a state of emergency, with back-to-back storms expected to bring measurable snowfall to most of the state by the weekend. One person was killed Tuesday when a car apparently slid off a slick road and struck a tree, McCrory's office said. More than 1,700 collisions were reported since Tuesday morning. Tennessee has reported 30 weather-related deaths in the past eight days, including car accidents, cases of carbon monoxide poisoning and hypothermia. As of Tuesday evening, there were 32,600 customers without power over six counties. Things will get interesting again by Wednesday afternoon. In Georgia, Gov. Nathan Deal ordered state government offices in 50 northern counties closed on Wednesday and declared a state of emergency for disaster preparedness, starting at 2 p.m. ""With forecasts showing we could see accumulation by 4 p.m., I want to make sure we get as many commuters home before then as possible,"" Deal said. State and local officials were heavily criticized for their response to a January 2014 storm that left a traffic nightmare and motorists stranded. Officials stress they have been well-prepared for this season's weather. The National Weather Service issued a winter storm warning in north Georgia for Wednesday through Thursday, with snow, rain and subfreezing temperatures in some areas. In addition, a fresh blast of Arctic air will swirl into the Upper Midwest and Northern Plains, cooling much of the eastern two-thirds of the country later this week. That means the Plains states will see temperatures more than 30 degrees below average Thursday and Friday. The Northeast will awake Thursday and Friday with temperatures 20 to 25 degrees below average. In case you've forgotten, Southerners aren't good with ice. And we're not talking just a little bit into the South, ice is possible nearly to the Gulf Coast. Officially, forecasters call it a wintry mix. That's code for snow, sleet, rain and freezing rain. Weather advisories are posted from east Texas to Virginia. Here's what the the nation is facing and how it's coping. An American Airlines plane skidded off a taxiway at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on Monday night.  The pilot was taxiing to the terminal when the plane got stuck.  No one was hurt. Lake Charles, Louisiana, is only 30 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, yet freezing rain is in the forecast.  The gators say this is a croc. Even though it's been on the chilly side for the last week -- virtually a lifetime for folks below the Mason-Dixon line -- Southerners still have a ways to go before perfecting their winter sports skills. Look for a scapegoat when all else (or is that all Elsa?) fails.  Police officers in Hanahan, South Carolina, tried to put the impending storm on ice by arresting the Disney princess lookalike.Sure it was a noble cause, but at what cost?  How many little girls will cry themselves to sleep thinking Elsa is behind bars? While the South struggles with winter, a Boston man has found a way to profit from it.  For $89, he'll express ship 6 pounds of snow to anywhere in the United States. It's packed in a Styrofoam container so it shouldn't melt too much.  Ship Snow, Yo sold out the first day and with 70 inches of the white stuff on the ground, the company should be able to fill orders for some time to come. You know winter has gone on too long when the New York Times writes an editorial about it.  Trying to ease the Big Apple out of its cabin fever, the headline simply reads:  ""This Winter Has Gotten Old."" Actually there's not much hope in the article, except that ""New Yorkers are relieved not to live in Boston. Bostonians, snow-buried, may be grateful not to be on the ice planet Hoth, where it's Boston winter everywhere, all the time."" And, if the snow and ice weren't bad enough, Floridians are acting all superior about their good fortunes.  A week ago, parts of the Sunshine state were in the deep freeze.  Now they're getting cocky. ""A ridiculous 84 in Orlando today!"" tweets meteorologist Tom Terry.  ""Soaking in the warm air as another ice/snow storm hammers the South."" Is hate too strong a word? CNN's Ray Sanchez, Phil Gast and Dorrine Mendoza contributed to this report.","Georgia and Alabama declare state of emergency; N.C. considers it .
Tennessee officials report 30 weather-related deaths in past week ."

"Read a version of this story in Arabic. Eddie Ray Routh was crying, shirtless, shoeless and smelling of alcohol when police caught up with him walking the streets of his hometown of Lancaster, Texas. His family didn't understand what he -- a Marine veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder -- was going through, he told the officer last September 2, according to a police report. He had a simple message that was as much a plea as it was a complaint: I'm hurting. That visit -- which came after Routh, angry that his father was going to sell his gun, left the house and threatened, his mother told police, to ""blow his brains out"" -- prompted him to be placed in protective custody and sent to Dallas' Green Oaks Hospital for a mental evaluation. Six months later, the 25-year-old Routh is in custody once again -- this time in a central Texas jail, facing murder charges in the deaths of America's self-proclaimed most deadly military sniper ever as well as the sniper's friend. He is on a suicide watch and under 24-hour camera surveillance, Erath County Sheriff Tommy Bryant said Monday. Should vets with PTSD, mental illness still have access to guns? And he's already run into further trouble, becoming aggressive with guards in his cell after refusing to give up a spork and dinner tray Sunday night, according to the sheriff. So who is Eddie Ray Routh? Bryant has said Routh was in the Marines for four years, though it is unclear how much of that time, if any, was in combat zones. Shay Isham, a lawyer appointed by a judge Monday morning to represent Routh, said his client spent roughly the last two years in and out in Veteran Affairs medical facilities for treatment of mental issues. His personal history and psychological make-up has come under the spotlight after the bloodshed Saturday. It was then, officials say, Routh killed two men on a gun range located in a remote part of the Rough Creek Lodge and Resort's vast 11,000 acres. This was, Bryant said, after Routh's mother ""may have reached out to"" one of the victims -- Chris Kyle, author of the best-selling book ""American Sniper"" -- ""to try and help her son."" The suspect  was ""a troubled veteran whom they were trying to help,"" said Craft International, a company founded by Kyle, who since retiring from the Navy in 2009 had sought to assist ex-troops with PTSD. Why might Routh have killed these men? He ""is the only one that knows,"" Erath County Sheriff's Capt. Jason Upshaw told reporters on Sunday. ""I don't know that we'll ever know,"" Upshaw said. Victims hailed as dedicated, caring patriots . No one else saw the shooting of Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, according to Upshaw. It occurred sometime after 3:15 p.m. (4:15 p.m. ET) Saturday, when all three men together entered the expansive resort in Glen Rose, some 70 miles southwest of Fort Worth, and headed toward a gun range. Marcus Luttrell told CNN that Kyle, his friend, had gone to help Routh get ""out of the house (and) blow off some steam."" Another Kyle friend, former SEAL sniper program instructor Brandon Webb, explained that a range was a ""familiar environment"" for ""military guys."" Around 5 p.m. Saturday, a hunting guide alerted authorities Kyle and Littlefield's bodies had been discovered ""lying on the ground, covered in blood,"" according to Routh's arrest warrant, which was posted on CNN affiliate WFAA's website. By then, Routh had taken off in Kyle's black Ford pickup, stopping first at his sister's house about 70 miles away in Midlothian. There, he told his sister and brother-in-law what he had done, telling them he had ""traded his soul for a truck,"" the arrest warrant said. He set off again. How the violent mentally ill can buy guns . Police finally caught up with Routh near his home in Lancaster, about 15 miles south of Dallas, around 8 p.m. Saturday. Despite a swarm of law enforcement, he managed to speed off in the truck -- but after spiking his tires, authorities were able to detain him without a scuffle by 9 p.m., Bryant said. The story got intense, widespread attention in large part due to the victims, especially Kyle. While serving as a sniper in Iraq, the Navy SEAL wrote he personally had 160 confirmed kills from a distance of up to 2,100 feet -- more than any other U.S. serviceman, in any conflict. This helped led Iraqi insurgents to nickname the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Texan ""the devil"" and put a bounty on his head, he said. In interviews promoting his book, Kyle offered no regrets, . ""I had to do it to protect the Marines,"" he told Time magazine a year ago. ""You want to lose your own guys, or would you rather take one of them out?"" After his retirement from a decade's service in the Navy, Kyle became a businessman, a reality TV personalty, a supporter of fellow vets, an avid hunter and an outspoken opponent of gun control. He leaves behind a wife and two children. His new ventures included joining other former SEALs in starting Craft International, a security company with the motto ""Despite what your momma told you, violence does solve problems."" He also helped established the FITCO Cares foundation, a charity that helps U.S. war vets ""who have survived combat but are still fighting to survive post-traumatic stress disorder,"" the group's website said. Thousands pledged to toast him and Littlefield on Monday night, and hundreds expressed condolences on Kyle's Facebook fan page. ""Chris, thank you for your service; not only to the country you loved, but also to your fellow warriors that needed a helping hand,"" one woman wrote. ""Rest in peace brave hero, patriot and warrior. You are missed."" The Facebook page also included a tribute to Littlefield, who the page's administrator wrote ""felt deeply about the values of family, compassion, friendship and loyalty, and was equally as passionate about his love of God and country."" ""Chad, thank you for your love for your country, the dedication to your country and your love for life,"" a woman said. ""God has brought another angel home."" Chris Kyle, America's deadliest sniper . Correction: Earlier versions of this report incorrectly described the military background of Chad Littlefield, who was killed with Chris Kyle. Littlefield was not a veteran. CNN's Ed Lavandera, Josh Levs, Susan Candiotti, AnneClaire Stapleton, Barbara Starr, Emily Smith and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Routh told his sister he'd killed two men, ""traded his soul for a truck,"" an arrest warrant says .

"(CNN)When Barack Obama issued just the third veto of his presidency on Tuesday, of a bill allowing construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, Republicans were outraged, or at least pretended they were outraged. House Speaker John Boehner called it a ""national embarrassment,"" and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell promised a vote to override the veto, as doomed an effort as every other piece of legislation Republicans hope to pass in the next two years. But maybe Obama wasn't cruelly crushing Republicans' hopes for the limitless economic bounty that the pipeline would bring, as it turned America into a tar-sands-fueled paradise of high wages and economic opportunity. Maybe he was actually doing them a favor. I say that because Republicans have really gone off the deep end when it comes to the Keystone XL, and they'll be well served to move past this issue and see if they can come up with some real economic ideas that might not only appeal to the public, but could have a chance of adding momentum to the economy. Because if you've listened to them for the past couple of years, you'd think that America's entire economic future depended on this one project. Any time a Republican politician was asked what we should do to improve the economy, the first thing that would come out of their mouth would be, ""We need to build the Keystone XL pipeline."" That's despite the fact that even under the most optimistic assessment, Keystone would have created 42,000 temporary jobs, and as few as 35 permanent jobs maintaining it. And those 42,000 included indirect jobs created by the spending on the pipeline, in every industry anyone could think of, from apparel to entertainment. To put it in a broader context, the U.S. economy created 3.2 million jobs in 2014, or 76 times as many as the temporary job number Keystone would have created under even the most generous accounting. If everything went well, Keystone could have increased the total number of jobs in the United States by a grand total of three one-hundredths of one percent. You can believe it was a good idea, but you can't honestly say it would have had a meaningful impact on an economy the size of America's. So why did Republicans become so invested in the Keystone XL? It isn't hard to understand. Once environmental activists seized on the pipeline as an organizing issue, one worth fighting about not only for its own sake but also as a concrete representation of climate change (which can sometimes seem like an abstract problem whose effects are mostly in the future), Republicans felt an obligation to join the battle, fire right back and say that it was absolutely vital to the nation's economic health. And of course, it meant supporting the fossil fuel industry, and the GOP is still the party of ""Drill, baby, drill!"" The longer the controversy dragged on, the more convinced Republicans became that building the pipeline was the most important thing we could do to get America back on its feet. But now that the Keystone drama is approaching its end, Republicans are going to have to come up with a new answer to the question of what they'd like to do to improve the economy. They have their old standbys — cut taxes, reduce regulations — but those are sounding rather stale at a time when people are concerned with inequality and stagnant wages. So perhaps now that they have no choice but to move beyond the Keystone XL, they'll come up with some creative ideas that might actually have a real impact on Americans' economic lives. Stranger things have happened.","Paul Waldman: Obama did GOP a favor with veto of Keystone, a project with claim to boosting economy that didn't hold up .
He says veto gives GOP an opportunity to come up with new ways to help grow economy and benefit all Americans ."
"(CNN)If fans were looking for a happy ending for (almost) all their favorite characters on Tuesday night's series finale of ""Parks and Recreation,"" they got just what they wanted. As the team planned to go their separate ways, viewers got a look into each character's future. Donna started a foundation after checking off everything on her bucket list; Craig found love with Ron's barber; Jean-Ralphio went on the run after faking his death; April and Andy had kids; Tom wrote a popular book about all his failures; Gary was mayor of Pawnee for decades before dying on his 100th birthday; Ron was put in charge of his own national park. And what about Ben and Leslie? They were both offered the chance to run for governor of Indiana at a party at the Bidens' home (hello, cameo!). In this flash-forward, they were reunited with the old gang once more, including Chris and Ann (it felt good to hear Chris say ""literally"" again). Another flash-forward showed that Leslie served two terms as governor (and Gary's funeral implied that either she or Ben became president). The narrative device insured that we all knew where their lives ended up and tied it all up with a bow -- though it pretty much eliminated the chance of any kind of reunion. Despite her worries about leaving her friends, Leslie said ""I'm ready"" to face the future as the series signed off (along with a tribute to late producer Harris Wittels). The show's finale was widely praised on social media and may someday rank as one of the best finales of all time. Twitter fans were touched and impressed with how it ended up. There was also plenty of discussion on social media about #WafflesAcrossAmerica, as the show frequently had characters gathered at JJ's Diner, where they would enjoy the breakfast staple.","The hit series ended its run Tuesday night .

"Atlanta (CNN)A little more than a year ago, it quickly became frustratingly obvious that officials in Georgia were underprepared and overwhelmed by a winter storm. About two weeks later, North Carolina had similar travel issues when a storm moved through the state, rapidly dumping snow and making roads in Raleigh and other cities impassable before people could drive back to the house. This time, authorities in those states say they are ready. There are more snow plows, more trucks to spread brine and authorities are staying ahead of the bad weather. And people are staying home or leaving work early. A late-season system threatens to scrape Atlanta with the kind of frozen precipitation that even in small amounts can turn a 45-minute commute into one lasting hours. Raleigh and Charlotte face a snowy night. North Carolina's capital might get 5 to 9 inches, and as many as 12 inches could fall in the Queen City, though between 5 and 8 is more likely, according to the National Weather Service. The storm may drop snow in almost every one of North Carolina's 100 counties. The good news is it is a fast-moving storm and should be gone by Thursday morning. Yeah, we hear you, New England. Doesn't sound like much of a storm, does it? Remember we're talking about an area of the country where many people don't even carry an ice scraper in their car. What might pass for a light dusting in Minneapolis or Boston can paralyze a city like Atlanta. Just over a year ago, a few inches of snow and ice left the city in gridlock. Parents scurried from work and hurried to the suburbs to get schoolchildren home. In some cases, Dad or Mom didn't arrive at home until the next afternoon. State and local officials were heavily criticized for their response to the January 2014 storm that created a traffic nightmare and left some motorists stranded for 18 hours or more. Never again, officials vowed. And they're leaving nothing to chance. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal ordered state of emergency for 51 northern counties. Deal said he was very confident there would be no repeat of clogged freeways. Russell McMurry of the Georgia Department of Transportation said roads from Atlanta to Tennessee and Alabama had been pre-treated. The governor of Tennessee -- where 30 weather-related deaths have been reported in the past nine days -- and the governor of Alabama also declared states of emergency. And North Carolina is prepared to do the same. A small child died in Mississippi. Greg Flynn with the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said the 2-year-old girl died in an auto accident after a car hydroplaned. Several Mississippi counties and cities issued curfews. Lee Bowdry, emergency management director for Lee County, said the storm began as sleet and ice, then turned to snow. ""We've had a lot of accidents here,"" he said. He said the county curfew would be lifted at 5 a.m. There also were restrictions in Calhoun County and in Houston, Okolona and Tupelo. Raleigh hopes to avoid a repeat of last year when just after the Atlanta snowbacle, the city had one of its own as drivers left work seemingly all at the same time. On Wednesday afternoon, most of the roads around the Triangle were still clear, and temperatures were in the 40s. Snow began falling just before 8 p.m. Eleven states had winter storm warnings in effect Wednesday, reason enough for schools across the region to shut down and bread and milk aisles to get stripped bare. The storm's path goes in a line from Texas to the Carolina coast, though its impact won't necessarily be even -- with a few miles here and there potentially meaning the difference between a soaking rain and a Snowmageddon or something in between. Take Tennessee, for instance, where Memphis and Nashville are forecast to get 1 to 2 inches of snow. Then there's Chattanooga, in the southeastern corner of the state, which can expect 3 to 7 inches. Snow isn't the only worry for the South. Sleet and even rain can sometimes be just as debilitating, as previous storms have proven. ""You never get accustomed to an ice storm,"" CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. ""There's nothing you can do in an ice storm when it really rains on ground that's (below freezing). You can't drive on it, it's hard to walk, maneuvering is impossible."" In Alabama, Joe Day found that out the way you don't want to. He and some friends thought it would be better for them to drive home to Evansville, Indiana, instead of worrying with canceled flights. They didn't make it far. They were stuck on I-65 about 30 miles north of Birmingham. Joe says a hill and snow-covered roadways led to backed-up traffic for miles. Those planning to fly in and out of the South are on call in preparation for canceled flights or on the phone to reschedule because that's already happened. As of 9 p.m., the air travel tracking website FlightAware was already reporting more than 1,540 cancellations Wednesday in and out of the United States (not every cancellation was weather-related). Its list of the most-affected airports has a distinctly Southern twang, with two around Dallas (DFW and Love Field, which were in the middle of the wintry muck in the morning) among those hardest hit. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson led every place with a reported more than 20% of its arriving and departing flights called off, something that could have far-reaching implications, given its standing as the one of the world's busiest airports. Some snow and travel headaches are nothing new, of course, for those in the North -- especially this winter. Folks there found plenty of humor in the South's predicament. ""In Wisconsin, we call this 'Wednesday,'"" joked Craig Koplien. CNN's Greg Botelho, Ray Sanchez, Phil Gast and Dorrine Mendoza contributed to this report.","Mississippi officials say one child dies in a car wreck .

"New Britain, Connecticut (CNN)The predicament Matthew Yussman found himself in -- pulled from his home by masked men, a dud bomb strapped around him, and ordered to clean out the bank where he worked -- is the stuff of movies. But this whodunit began Monday in a quiet cul-de-sac in Bristol, Connecticut. And two days later, police say they are still searching for the two men who forced their way into Yussman's home and ordered him to carry out the heist. It was still dark, when Yussman pulled into his driveway, he told police. As he tried to go inside, the men forced their way in with him. His mother was inside. The men, who Yussman said wore dark clothes, ski masks and goggles, tied the two of them up and affixed ""explosives"" to them, Yussman told police. When the men spoke, their accents made them sound like they weren't from the area. The men gave Yussman an order. He was to drive to the Achieve Financial Credit Union, where he worked as chief financial officer, clean out the vault and return home with the cash, Yussman told authorities. As he drove, Yussman didn't call 911, but instead another bank executive. The executive called 911, The Bristol Press reported. The credit union evacuated; police rushed in, and Yussman never made it inside. Officers took no chances and had schools in two towns locked down. They also shut down a main highway for three hours. ""It was a very scary day,"" Mayor Stewart said. Police called in a bomb squad to free Yussman from the device, while he sat in his car. They said the object strapped to him was harmless, The Bristol Press reported. Yussman was led to an ambulance in handcuffs and was checked over at a hospital. When Yussman told police his home had been invaded, they cordoned off the area around his house. But then his mother came walking out on her own. She had freed herself, she told police, who found no sign of explosives in the home, The Bristol Press reported. Police also said that the suspects in Yussman's account drove a white 4-door automobile. A neighbor told The Bristol Press that he had seen a strange vehicle outside Yussman's house on Monday. But he declined to give more detail, as the FBI has asked him not to discuss the case. The plot surrounding Yussman is reminiscent of that of pizza delivery man Brian Wells in 2003. Wells walked into a bank with a jerry-rigged bomb around his neck, saying if the bank didn't hand over money, the people behind the scheme would detonate the bomb and kill him. Wells died, when the bomb exploded on live TV. But investigators later determined that Wells himself was in on the scheme. Wells' family still insists he was an innocent victim. CNN's Julia Talanova and Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.","Police found Matthew Yussman in his employer's parking lot with a dud bomb strapped to him .

"(CNN)Three more athletes who say they were scammed out of an education at the University of North Carolina are now suing over academic fraud, and the whistleblower who exposed the fake-class system has now settled her lawsuit with the university. Former basketball player Kenya McBee has joined former football player Mike McAdoo's federal class-action lawsuit, claiming the university denied him and thousands of other athletes education when advisers forced him to take classes that never met. Former basketball player Leah Metcalf, and former football player James Arnold filed a separate but similar class-action lawsuit in state court in North Carolina. Ken Wainstein, who was hired by the university to act as an independent investigator, revealed in October that academic fraud had taken place at UNC for 18 years, and that UNC officials were wrong when they denied -- for nearly five years -- that anyone in athletics was involved. Instead it was players, like McAdoo, who were blamed by the university for cheating and punished by the NCAA. ""All of these student-athletes were promised a legitimate UNC education, were implored to trust UNC academic advising, and were then guided into academically bereft courses against their interests,"" said attorney Jeremi Duru, one of the attorneys representing these athletes. Earlier this year high-profile attorney Michael Hausfeld filed a class-action suit against UNC and the NCAA over the same scandal. About 3,100 students -- nearly half of them athletes -- who enrolled in the fake classes could easily join these lawsuits. Mary Willingham, the whistleblower who began revealing details about the sham classes, accused UNC of retaliating against her before she quit last year, and then sued the university to get her job back. Willingham told CNN that she reached a settlement agreement with the school this week, although it had not yet been approved by a judge. It would compensate her financially but not restore her job as a learning specialist and adviser. ""I wanted to show other potential whistleblowers out there that it's possible to survive a fight with a big-money machine. I settled because I thought that it was time to get focused back on the issue of athletes and their educations -- to correct the injustice in the NCAA system,"" she said, adding that the terms of the settlement will become public when it's finalized. UNC said, ""We believe the settlement is in the best interest of the University and allows us to move forward and fully focus on other important issues.""","Ex-basketball player joins ex-football player in class-action federal lawsuit; 2 other athletes sue in state court .

"(Mental Floss) -- Between her Snickers Super Bowl ad and the petition to have her host ""Saturday Night Live,"" Betty White has been getting a lot of press lately. She's been in the business since the 1940s, so you can bet Betty has a few interesting stories up her sleeve. Wouldn't you just love to sit at the kitchen table and eat late-night cheesecake with her? Here are a few of the tales she might tell. 1. Like many other celebrities, Betty graduated from Beverly Hills High School. Class of '39! 2. Don't call her Elizabeth -- it's not her name. Her parents went with ""Betty"" on her 1922 birth certificate because they weren't too keen on any of the other nicknames that can go along with Elizabeth. 3. One of her first gigs was as a disc jockey (kind of). She was the assistant to Al Jarvis, who hosted a program called ""Hollywood on Television"", a variety show that included playing records just like a radio disc jockey did. Betty was Al's right-hand woman for a few years in the '40s and ended up taking over the show entirely when he left. 4. Younger viewers know Betty White mostly from her ditzy role as Rose Nylund on ""The Golden Girls."" When our favorite show about sassy elderly women first came on the scene, though, television audiences were most familiar with Betty as the tart-tongued, man-hungry Sue Ann Nivens from ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" In fact, she was initially offered the role of similarly insatiable Blanche Devereaux because of her previous role as Sue Ann. At the first table reading for the show, Rue and Betty switched characters to avoid being typecast (Rue had previously played a sweet, naïve, Rose-type character) and the rest is TV history. Mental Floss: 11 stars and big TV roles they rejected . 5. She's been calling the shots since a time when women didn't get to call the shots very often. Betty received credits as co-creator, producer, and star of the 1952 sitcom ""Life with Elizabeth."" The show earned Betty her first Emmy -- Outstanding Lead Actress. She wouldn't see another one until 1975, when she won for Outstanding Supporting Actress for her role in ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show."" 6. You probably don't want to have her over for game night, unless you don't mind losing. In the '50s and '60s, Betty was known as ""The First Lady of Game Shows"" thanks to her appearances on ""Password,"" ""What's My Line,"" ""To Tell the Truth,"" ""Match Game"" and ""Pyramid."" 7. In fact, she even married a game show host. She met her third husband, Password host Allen Ludden, during a guest appearance. If you're familiar with Ludden, you know he later started his shows with the trademark phrase, ""Hi, Doll."" This was his little nod to Betty's mom, Tess, who was an avid watcher. Betty and Allen were married from 1963 until his death in 1981. 8. She might seem sweet, but  White has a wicked sense of humor. When fellow Golden Girl Rue McClanahan was hospitalized after having a stroke earlier this year, a friend of Rue's reported that Betty had sent a ""Don't Get Well"" card that said something along the lines of, ""Dear Rue, I hope you hurry up and die so I can be the last Golden Girl left. NOT KIDDING."" Rue apparently got a huge kick out of it. Mental Floss: 7 things to know about ""The Golden Girls"" 9. Another example of Betty's not-so-sweet humor: if you ask her if there's anything she hasn't done in her career, her stock reply is, ""Robert Redford."" She's confessed that she's never actually met him and would now be embarrassed if she did. 10. Despite all her success in the television and film industries, Betty has said that when her time comes, she would rather be remembered for her work with animals and animal-related charities. But don't call her an activist! Here's what she has to say about that: . ""I don't get into the political side or the demonstrative side. I'm just totally devoted to health and welfare. You know what the problem that animal activists sometimes have? They only concentrate on the heartbreaking things to the point where the general public think, 'Oh, here comes those animal folks again and I'm going to hear all the things I don't want to hear.' They forget to celebrate all the gains that we've made. ... Sure, there are still big problems, but we're making some good moves. I'm a big cockeyed optimist. I try to accentuate the positive as opposed to the negative."" Mental Floss: 10 weird celebrity phobias . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- The man who held at least three hostages in a nearly four-hour standoff Wednesday at the Discovery Channel headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland, had a history of protesting the network's programming, authorities said. The man was identified by law enforcement sources as 43-year-old James Lee, who was shot and killed by police after officers observed him withdrawing a handgun and pointing it at one of the hostages. All three hostages -- identified by a Discovery executive as two employees and a security officer -- were uninjured. Lee was described by authorities as an environmental protester who had posted online rants against Discovery in the past. An angry manifesto posted by Lee on a website called SaveThePlanetProtest.com repeatedly refers to humans as ""filth"" and demands that the Discovery Channel ""stop encouraging the birth of any more parasitic human infants."" ""Civilization must be exposed for the filth it is,"" the 1,149-word statement says. ""Humans are the most destructive, filthy, pollutive creatures around and are wrecking what's left of the planet with their false morals and breeding culture,"" it continues. The statement also blasts immigration, farming, weapons of mass destruction, automotive pollution, ""and the whole blasted human economy."" It demands that the Discovery Channel broadcast daily prime-time shows devoted to ""solutions to save the planet,"" perhaps in a game-show format, insisting ""Make it interesting so people watch and apply solutions!!!!"" Many of Lee's comments are directed at ""the media,"" saying ""You can reach enough people. It's your responsibility because you reach so many minds!!!"" ""The world needs TV shows that DEVELOP solutions to the problems that humans are causing, not stupify the people into destroying the world. Not encouraging them to breed more environmentally harmful humans,"" the manifesto says. ""These are the demands and sayings of Lee,"" the manifesto concludes. The website also refers to a week-long protest outside the Discovery headquarters in February 2008. ""I will be demonstrating ideas on how to save the planet in front of the Discovery Channel Building each day until they give in,"" he wrote. Montgomery County, Maryland, Circuit Court records show a man by the same name and age was arrested that month for disorderly conduct and littering. According to a report by Maryland's Gazette newspaper published at the time, a protester identified as James Lee was arrested outside the Discovery building after several hours of throwing money into the air to gather a crowd. Montgomery County Police Chief J. Thomas Manger confirmed that the suspect in the hostage situation was the same protester. Lee, who represented himself in court, said he did it to show that ""money means nothing. Money is trash,"" the Gazette quoted him as saying. Amateur video apparently showing part of the protest shows a chaotic scene of people diving for the bills. The protest was cut short after concerns by county police and Discovery security officers that the growing crowd was becoming unruly, according to testimony from Sgt. John Meng of the Montgomery County Police Department. Lee was found guilty of disorderly conduct in the case and sentenced to supervised probation. His probation ended August 18, court records show. At the time of his conviction, the judge warned Lee not to come within 500 feet of Discovery Communications, according to the Gazette. The judge told Lee he could get 60 days in jail if he disobeyed the order. On his protest site, Lee refers to the arrest, writing, ""Yeah, I guess the world did not get saved last week as I had hoped,"" and indicates he was held in police custody for two weeks. Lee told the court that part of his time in custody included a psychiatric evaluation, according to the Gazette. ""I told them my idea of saving the planet,"" the Gazette quoted him as saying. ""They couldn't find anything wrong with me."" Discovery spokesman David Leavy said Wednesday that the network was aware of Lee and his writings. ""I don't want to characterize the motivations of the perpetrator,"" he said. ""If you follow what he said publicly online, I don't think it's rational. We certainly were cognizant and aware of him, but certainly did not take his threats or demands seriously."" Lee appeared to be inspired by the writings of environmentalist author Daniel Quinn, according to statements made in the manifesto and on Lee's MySpace page. Quinn is best known for the novel, ""Ishmael,"" for which he won the 1991 Turner Tomorrow Fellowship. The fellowship was established to encourage authors to seek ""creative and positive solutions to global problems,"" according to Quinn's website. In a 2006 MySpace posting, Lee wrote: ""I finished reading the Daniel Quinn books last month. It started off just as a recommendation from a girl who worked at a coffeehouse. ""After being blown away from his writings, I looked up and saw ... nothing. No revolution, no people demanding change, no talk, no news, nothing. There should have been something, right?"" Lee's self-proclaimed goal to save the planet appears to have begun shortly after the posting. However, much of his online activity appears to have ended in 2008.","The suspect appeared to be inspired by the writings of ""Ishmael"" author Daniel Quinn .

"(CNN) -- To some, she was a lifelong role model. Others call Pakistan's former prime minister and the first female prime minister of any Muslim nation a source of inspiration to women everywhere. One I-Reporter acknowledges, ""I never was a political supporter of Benazir Bhutto but now after her death I feel that her loss is a loss for Pakistan, not just her political supporters."" Anthony G. Moore photographed Benazir Bhutto with her husband Asif Ali Zardari in New York in 2006. Benazir Bhutto was assassinated during a suicide bombing on December 27, 2007, and I-Reporters from all over the world responded with their memories and condolences. Below are selections, some of which have been edited for length and clarity. Farhad Sethi of Lahore, Pakistan  Breathing in the air of grief and sadness, the nation suffers the loss of our beloved leader Benazir Bhutto, an institution in herself withstanding pressures at times when suicide bombing has become an unstoppable enigma. A sniper pierced a bullet through her neck and our enthusiastic leader couldn't even make it to the hospital, her last words God knows what were they but her face and inspirational personality will always be remembered. A woman who grew up with politics in her backyard is no longer with us, she was a graduate from Harvard and Oxford universities and seeing her go down in a wooden casket was a sight bringing down tears in every eye. We all have to go down the ground one day but being assassinated like this is not something we would want for even our worst enemies. She has left a space that will never be filled in the hearts and minds of the nation. She has enjoyed the position of being the first Muslim woman to lead a country as Prime Minister, but this is over she's gone, may Allah (swt) have mercy on her soul and she rests in peace in a better place. Ameen. Al Alston of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Benazir Bhutto's gifts to Pakistan and the world far outweigh the charges made by her adversaries. I will never forget how she led Pakistan in its unwavering support for the African National Congress during the misery of the apartheid days. Her presence at the inauguration of Nelson Mandela left an indelible impression on me. I remain an admirer of her nation because of this critical alliance. I will keep her family and nation in my prayers. Mickin Sahni of Stone Ridge, Virginia  As a first generation Indian-American, I have heard from my parents the turmoil on the subcontinent as their parents were forced to India while their friends were forced to Pakistan. Bhutto's effort to reconcile the differences between the two countries was one of her main missions. Indians throughout the world remember her as a peaceful link between the two nuclear superpowers and could only sympathize with Pakistanis grieving throughout the world. Hopefully her efforts were not in vain. Sandra Rios of Aberdeen, Maryland  Benazir Bhutto loved her country and people so much that despite an assassination attempt in Oct and continuous death threats she remained unshaken. As a Women and a Former US soldier I admire her bravery. Russ Bonny of Golden, Colorado  I haven't had the raw emotions I am feeling right now since September 11, 2001. The death of Mrs. Bhutto is a loss for the entire world and a grim reminder of how tirelessly we must fight extremists. Whitney Anderson of Irving, Texas  I never really got the chance to know much about this woman. I'm still a teen, trying to figure out this mess we call our own democracy. But I can say this. For anyone to be slaughtered is a shame. It's crazy to think young adults like myself have had to grow up in a time where planes are flown into buildings, wars are dragging on and dragging us down, and now a revered and respected woman is dead, only because she was trying to better the world. I can only hope my future children don't have to live like this, and that the only time they hear of things like this is in a history book. Shima of Tehran, Iran  All Persians know what her name means... Her name means Unique, and she was unique in all her life. God bless her. Naureen Haider of Jensen Beach, Florida  It's a great loss to the country. Ms. Bhutto went to the same elementary school as mine, Convent of Jesus and Mary School in Karachi, and she was always an example to us, to motivate, thus that it is proud to be a female. Benazir, not only earned the best of qualifications on merit, but also proved to the world, that this is what patriotism is. My family having met Benazir personally several times, sends our deepest condolences to the family and prayers go out to the children. May Allah be with them. Ameen!! Humnaa Umar of Great Falls, Virginia  The death of Benazir Bhutto not only marked the end of a revolutionary political leader, but also the demise of a pioneer in terms of women's rights. In a country with a strict gender hierarchy, Bhutto inspired countless women with her ceaseless supply of fortitude.  Mwilu Mwanachilenga of Lusaka, Zambia  A Martyr. A pity though that a life that I looked up to, for the whole 25 years of my existence, could ever end like this. Condolences to the family and may her soul rest in peace . Sabina Brauner of Frankfurt, Germany  Disbelief was my first reaction when I just read the news. And shock. At such violence. I do not remember her as an outstanding figure but when someone mentioned Pakistan there was that immediate connection: Pakistan-Bhutto. So after such an act you just hope against hope that people there will find peace. I wish them all the best. Ahsan Khan of Reading, United Kingdom  I never was a political supporter of Benazir Bhutto but now after her death I feel that her loss is a loss for Pakistan and not just for her political followers. The present government setup has failed and should resign to stop further bloodshed. God bless Benazir Bhutto's soul. Erum Qayyum of Lahore, Pakistan  As the first female prime minister in the Muslim world, I felt as if women are really going to get ahead and men would actually start taking their technical knowledge more seriously but of course men are men. Her death was appalling and the way it happened. It has shocked me and everyone else in my family even though we are not really Benazir's supporters. It is a wonder that my land of Pakistan is actually going to the dogs where no one is safe. I wish the Bush administration opens its eyes to what's happening because neither the civilian nor the military governments have done anything to make this land of mine more peaceful and secure to live in. Moses Quinion Galabuzi of Kampala, Uganda  It is too sad to hear of the assassination of this great lady. I was following her very closely and had a lot of respect for her. Whoever did kill her will die the same way but will never be a hero just as she was. Rest in peace Honorable Benazir Bhutto. May the good Lord reward you for the great things you did. Carlo Zappa of Montreal, Quebec  When will the horror in Pakistan end? My heart goes out to her family and to the people of Pakistan. Her life was cut short and mankind will never see the additional good she could have done to resolve the endless political conflict in India. Ahmed Alian of Cairo, Egypt  She was a brave woman in a coward world, may her soul rest in peace. I'm not blaming Musharraf for killing her, but I'm blaming him for feeding the atmosphere of terrorism through his dictatorship, which is unfortunately, supported by the so-called ""free world."" Oyefeso Temitope of Lagos, Nigeria  You had a heart to help save Pakistan from military dictatorship, and you have to pay with your life!!! What a world!!! We await the reaction of the West. Sleep well, it was a just curse and rare fight from a woman. Linda Palumbo of Boston, Massachusetts  A woman who was beautiful, brilliant and dedicated to bringing peace to her country. Such a tragedy and such a loss for the people of Pakistan. Kartiq Subramanian of Charlotte, North Carolina  This is really sad! My limited political knowledge told me that she was Pakistan's only hope toward democracy and peace and now her killing has proved that. I feel sad for her family and for the people of Pakistan. May peace prevail. Fariha Waseem of Spring Valley, New York  Benazir Bhutto is a woman of courage and conviction and we Pakistani's are proud to acknowledge her with all the dedication and deeds she made for her country. She stands for principal of democracy and corruptions and wants to remove it from roots. She not only received awards for her books but for her all dedications she did for her peoples. My condolence is with all the loved ones of Bhutto's family and her party workers. May God rest her soul in Peace! (Amen) Funmi Omoniyi of Lagos, Nigeria  We will miss you Benazir Bhutto because you are a strong woman, ready to fight for your country. As a woman of substance, you deserve to rest in perfect peace. May Allah grant you Aljanat Amiin. Kimberley Brewer of Ottawa, Ontario  Although I have no ties, either familial or political, to Benazir Bhutto, I am deeply saddened and enraged by her murder. This noble leader, who championed women's rights in a society rife with discrimination toward fully half the population, has been felled by cowards who seek to thwart progress and peace. My heart goes out to all who mourn her loss as I do, and my condemnation to those responsible for this horrific act of barbarism. Mohammad Khurram Khan of Cleveland, Ohio  It is a sad day for all Pakistanis and the entire world. This is a direct result of the aftermath of September 11 and its ongoing consequences around the world. The blazes set forth by the terrorist continue to burn today in different cities. Bhutto was a legend and a role model for all men and women alike. She was inspirational not just to Pakistanis, but inspirational to us all through out the world. It is saddening (with tears in my eyes and sorrow in my heart) to see such a [legend] become a part of the blaze beset by the terrorists. Terrorists have no religion or political affiliations. They only have motives driven by greed and power. I certainly hope that the terrorist behind this are brought to justice and I am sure that General Musharraf will do his best to do so as he has always done in the interest of Pakistan.

"(CNN)It was meant as a joke, but Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein inadvertently cut to the chase with the perception hanging over world football as it wrestles with the decision as to re-elect FIFA president Sepp Blatter or opt for a new beginning. ""Do we have any football questions?"" quipped the Jordanian, as he launched his bid to become head of an organization whose reputation has taken a bit battering in recent years. Yes, there was last year's World Cup, which garnered plenty of plaudits, but invariably when FIFA's name crops up it's to do with the rights and wrongs of its decision to award the next two competitions to Russia and Qatar. So as a light dusting of snow slowly melted outside a swanky London hotel, Prince Ali turned up the heat on the current head of world football. ""I think the main point is to have a new culture"" Ali told CNN in an interview after he addressed the media for the first time since announcing his intention to run. ""It's about not having the game controlled by people's personal opinions or the whims of the president. It needs to be inclusive for all."" At the moment a spirit of inclusion is not altogether apparent in FIFA's corridors of power, with ethics investigator Michael Garcia resigning in December to protest the handling of his own report into Qatar and Russia's successful bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The string of controversies have put FIFA's internal politics at the front and center of the presidential race. Prince Ali spoke of a ""culture of intimidation"" within FIFA, with some national associations fearing retribution if they back any other candidate other than Blatter, though he didn't provide specific examples. FIFA declined to comment when contacted by CNN over Prince Ali's ""intimidation"" reference. A vice president of the Asian Football Confederation, Jordan was the only country from that continent to lend its backing to Ali, who relied on England, the United States, Belarus, Georgia and Malta to complete his bid. His campaign is being masterminded by Vero Communications Ltd, a public relations company that also has a wider communications brief working with UEFA, the European confederation within FIFA. ""I've tried as much as I can to reform it from within... having seen what's happened I'm not going to allow another four years of this,"" Prince Ali said of FIFA's internal workings. As well as Blatter, Prince Ali is up against former Portugal captain -- and 2001's FIFA World Player of the Year -- Luis Figo, who says he who was convinced to stand after FIFA's handling of the Garcia report. Also running is the head of Dutch soccer, Michael van Praag, 67, who has openly called for Blatter to stand down, taking it upon himself to restore what he sees as a lack of trustworthiness in the organization. If elected, the 39-year-old Prince Ali could become the first Muslim to lead FIFA in its 101-year history. He previously led calls for FIFA to lift its ban on the hijab that was preventing many Muslim women from following their football dreams. ""I've been a huge supporter of the women's game -- across the world,"" he said. ""It's the biggest growth area in football right now. It needs to be taken much more seriously, and I'm willing and committed to doing so."" Prince Ali was also keen to stress his commitment to ridding football of any form of prejudice. ""I think that there should be no discrimination in football in any way, shape or form,"" he added. Whilst the Jordanian prince is out and proud about his intentions, this may not be enough to challenge Blatter's 16-year dynasty. In the meantime Ali had better get used to talking politics, as it seems football is off the agenda.","FIFA presidential candidate Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein speaks about organization's culture of intimidation'

"(CNN)Once was a time when finding out if you were compatible with someone involved a complex social interplay of body language, conversational nuance and good food and wine. Tomorrow it could simply be a matter of reading someone else's T-shirt. A joint venture between design teams at MIT's Tangible Media Group and the Fluid Interface Group have incorporated the social network into a garment which signals to other wearers your interests, associations and even if people are compatible organ donors. The group of MIT students behind the project - Viirj Kan, Katsuya Fujii, Judith Amores, and Chang Long Zhu Jin  - wanted to look at ways of seeing how social media worked outside the confines of the computer screen. ""We wanted to examine more tangible ways of representing ourselves in social media,"" Kan told CNN. ""While what you wear is very public, social media is able to show who you are to thousands more people and this creates really big social consequences but it often doesn't feel that way."" She said the idea behind the wearable was to probe this question further. ""Current technologies are very good at connecting people over great distances but they're not so good at connecting them in the same environment,"" Kan said. ""There's this gap and we wanted to explore that through what we've built."" Sporting a chic alphabet design on the front, the T-shirt's pattern is printed in thermo-chromatic ink with a thin circuit membrane under the weave. The T-shirt uses Bluetooth to pair with your phone and all your critical data. After that, all the T-shirt has to do is detect another T-shirt within 12 feet of a receiver in its collar and the wearer is alerted through a haptic motor which literally 'taps' the wearer alerting them to the fact there's another wearable device in the room. As with all social interaction, the experience is graded. After the T-shirt has alerted you to the fact there's another wearer in the room, capacitive sensors in the shirt read either a handshake, touch or high five before the T-shirt starts transmitting your data and you begin wearing your heart on your sleeve. ""We've got a working prototype but we've yet to test it on users -- that's definitely the next step,"" Kan said. She said the ability of the shirt to transmit data is only limited by the imagination of the designer. Groups that need to find each other in a crowd -- from industry conferences to people who are part of a niche interest -- are likely to want to use the clothing to find like-minded souls. ""Perhaps if you need to know other vegetarians -- or those with a vegetarian lifestyle -- so it helps to know if I was at a burger place who around me is a vegetarian,"" Kan said. While the shirt is still in the research and development phase, the group says that commercial sponsors have a growing interest in the product. ""We're testing its capabilities -- it's hard to say what its limits are,"" she said.","A joint venture between design teams at MIT's Tangible Media Group and the Fluid Interface Group have incorporated the social network into a garment .

"(CNN)Talk about a ""Modern Family."" Wednesday night's ""Modern Family"" was shot entirely using Apple products. Titled ""Connection Lost,"" the episode revolved around the family communicating via all of Apple's devices -- iPhones, iPads and a MacBook. During the ABC show, character Claire Dunphy uses her MacBook Pro to communicate with her family while sitting at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The New York Daily News reported that series creator Steve Levitan said the move made sense for the Emmy-winning show because ""We shoot digitally anyway."" ""Our thinking was, why shoot the episode with our sophisticated and ridiculously expensive cameras, only then to have to run it through some process to make it look exactly like an iPhone?"" Levitan asked. Product placement in television series is not new, but ""Modern Family's"" Apple-centric episode is the most extensive example to date. In a segment on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" Levitan promoted the episode and said it grew out of him FaceTiming with his daughter. Rico Rodriguez, who plays Manny on the show, told ""GMA"" the episode was filmed over two days. It took cast members a little bit to catch on with the new way of filming, but it was fun, he said. ""It takes a lot of work to do it, but if you do it, it's going to come out great,"" Rodriguez said. It's not the first time ""Modern Family"" had an Apple-friendly episode. A storyline during the first season about character Phil Dunphy (played by Ty Burrell) trying to get an iPad came under criticism as an endorsement for the company. But according to The Hollywood Reporter, the show received no money for either that episode or the one Wednesday night. ""There's no product placement or anything,"" Levitan told the publication. ""This just came from life, and it made sense."" Mashable's Sandra Gonzalez wrote that the episode worked because --  despite the way the plot was told -- ""the show didn't lose its core purpose: to tell a family story."" ""Bonus points to the writers for the great attention to detail,"" she wrote. ""Almost everything about Claire's digital world seemed fleshed out, down to the previous communications with her children. If you looked at the history of Claire's text messages to Haley, there was one where she had simply written 'chicken and something,' which we can assume was in reply to a query about dinner.

"(CNN)Not since Lena Baker, an African-American convicted of murder and pardoned decades later, has Georgia executed a woman. The state was scheduled to snap that 70-year streak Wednesday before Kelly Renee Gissendaner's execution was postponed. Just hours before the 47-year-old was scheduled to die by lethal injection at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson, the Georgia Department of Corrections announced it had postponed the execution until Monday ""due to weather and associated scheduling issues,"" department spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan said in an email. Gissendaner was convicted in a February 1997 murder plot that targeted her husband in suburban Atlanta. She was romantically involved with Gregory Owen and conspired with the 43-year-old to have her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, killed, according to court testimony. Owen wanted Kelly Gissendaner to file for a divorce, but she was concerned that her husband would ""not leave her alone if she simply divorced him,"" court documents said. The Gissendaners had already divorced once, in 1993, and they remarried in 1995. Details of the crime, as laid out at trial and provided by Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, are as follows: . Owen and Kelly Gissendaner planned the murder for months. On February 7, 1997, she dropped Owen off at her home, gave him a nightstick and hunting knife and went out dancing with girlfriends. Douglas Gissendaner also spent the evening away from home, going to a church friend's house to work on cars. Owen lay in wait until he returned. When Douglas Gissendaner came home around 11:30 p.m., Owen forced him by knifepoint into a car and drove him to a remote area of Gwinnett County. There, Owen ordered his victim into the woods, took his watch and wallet to make it look like a robbery, hit him in the head with the nightstick and stabbed Douglas Gissendaner in the neck eight to 10 times. Kelly Gissendaner arrived just as the murder took place, but did not immediately get out of her car. She later checked to make sure her husband was dead, then Owen followed her in Douglas Gissendaner's car to retrieve a can of kerosene that Kelly Gissendaner had left for him. Owen set her husband's car on fire in an effort to hide evidence and left the scene with Kelly Gissendaner. Police discovered the burned-out automobile the morning after the murder, but did not find the body. Authorities kicked off a search. Kelly Gissendaner, meanwhile, went on local television appealing to the public for information on her husband's whereabouts. Her and Owen's story started to unravel after a series of police interviews. On February 20, Douglas Gissendaner's face-down body was found about a mile from his car. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be knife wounds to the neck, but the medical examiner couldn't tell which strike killed Douglas Gissendaner because animals had devoured the skin and soft tissue on the right side of his neck. On February 24, Owen confessed to the killing and implicated Kelly Gissendaner, who was arrested the next day and charged. While in jail awaiting trial, Kelly Gissendaner grew angry when she heard Owen was to receive a 25-year sentence for his role in the murder. (Owen is serving life in prison at a facility in Davisboro, according to Georgia Department of Corrections records.) She began writing letters to hire a third person who would falsely confess to taking her to the crime scene at gunpoint. She asked her cellmate, Laura McDuffie, to find someone willing to do the job for $10,000, and McDuffie turned Kelly Gissendaner's letters over to authorities via her attorney. Kelly Gissendaner has exhausted all state and federal appeals, the attorney general said in a statement. The State Board of Pardons and Paroles denied her clemency request, Steve Hayes, a spokesman for the board, said Wednesday. In the clemency application, Gissendaner's lawyers argued she was equally or less culpable than Owen, who actually did the killing. Both defendants were offered identical plea bargains before trial: life in prison with an agreement to not seek parole for 25 years. Owen accepted the plea bargain and testified against his former girlfriend. Gissendaner was willing to plead guilty, her current lawyers said, but consulted with her trial lawyer and asked prosecutors to remove the stipulation about waiting 25 years to apply for parole. According to her clemency appeal, her lead trial attorney, Edwin Wilson, said he thought the jury would not sentence her to death  ""because she was a woman and because she did not actually kill Doug. ... I should have pushed her to take the plea but did not because I thought we would get straight up life if she was convicted."" Her appeal lawyers also argued that Gissendaner had expressed deep remorse for her actions, become a model inmate and grown spiritually. They said her death would cause further hardship for her two children. According to the Death Penalty Information Center . Between 1973 and 2012 -- the most recent data available -- 178 death sentences have been imposed upon female offenders. These sentences constitute about 2% of all death sentences. Five states -- North Carolina, Florida, California, Ohio and Texas -- account for over half of all such sentences. As of December 31, 2012, there were 61 women on death row. The present ages of the women on death row range from 28 to 79. They have been on death row from a few months to over 26 years. For her last meal, she requested an extravagant one: two Burger King Whoppers with cheese (with everything), two large orders of fries, popcorn, cornbread, a side of buttermilk and a salad with tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, carrots, cheese, boiled eggs and Paul Newman buttermilk dressing, the Corrections Department said. She also requested a glass of lemonade and cherry-vanilla ice cream for dessert. Currently the only woman on Georgia's death row, Gissendaner could be the second woman in the state's history to be executed. The first was Baker, an African-American maid who was sentenced to death by an all-white, all-male jury in 1944. She claimed self-defense for killing a man who held her against her will, threatened her life and appeared poised to hit her with a metal bar before she fired the fatal shot. Sixty year after her execution, Georgia's parole board posthumously pardoned her after finding that ""it was a grievous error to deny (her) clemency."" Such pardons are rare, but so are executions of women. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, only 15 women have been executed in the United States since 1977. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","State postpones Kelly Gissendaner's execution because of a threat of bad weather .

"(CNN)In the thick of Hong Kong's concrete jungle, surrounded by dense residential spaces and a web of roaring highways lies the Jockey Club Innovation Tower at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. The building, which opened just over a year ago, is the new home for the university's design students. Although it is affiliated with the Hong Kong Jockey Club, it has nothing to do with horse racing and everything to do with design. Stretching 15 stories skywards and with interior space measuring up to 15,000 square-meters, the $81 million tower consists of labs, workshop spaces, classrooms and exhibition areas that are open to the public. It's a stark contrast to the rest of the old-fashioned red-brick campus. Displaying fluid corridors, curvaceous walls, and a radical structure, the Innovation Tower is also the first building from renowned Iraqi-born British architect Zaha Hadid to be built in Hong Kong. ""The school has a long history but it used to be blended into the campus, it was quite sort of hidden,"" said Simon Yu, an architect at Zaha Hadid Architects. ""Now with a new home it brings it all out into one hub."" It's hoped the futuristic design will inspire the next generation of ambitious artists, architects and designers currently studying on the 50-year-old campus. The design ""tries to do all that by exposing as much sort of visually as possible, not just the work from the students but of course the building,"" Yu added. For the students, the building is a fresh source of stimulation. Second year design student, Fatina Pong, describes the importance of studying and being located in a building that emphasizes all sorts of creative possibilities. ""When I stepped in this building... it's kind of a sense of identity and I feel like I'm a design student,"" she said. ""The thing you see like the walls and the lights and the shapes of the building actually affects your thinking of design."" But beyond an environment that inspires innovation, the school also has diverse global ambitions. It has already drawn up to 150,000 visitors since it opened last year. ""It attracts people. It's not only (for) our students and our teachers in the building,"" said Professor Timothy Tong, President, Hong Kong Polytechnic University . ""Constantly we have folks from the business sector, we have folks from the industries, coming here to interact with our students and professors...our students in fact get exposed to a much wider field of design."" Bold, ambitious and slanting to the future, this school hopes to shake up Hong Kong's design industry and influence the shape of the city in the future as well.","The Jockey Club Innovation Tower at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University opened in 2011 at cost of $81 million .

"Less than a week after dissolving the parliament, Jordan's King Abdullah II appointed a new prime minister Wednesday as the country deals with demands for political reform. Abdullah Ensour, the new prime minister, is tasked with forming a new government -- Jordan's fifth in two years. He was appointed after King Abdullah accepted the resignation of outgoing Prime Minister Fayez al-Tarawneh, the country's royal court said. Last week, thousands of peaceful protesters gathered in Amman to call for constitutional reforms, saying the king has too much power. They demanded that representatives be able to run for election in a democratic system rather than be under his control. King Abdullah has also called for early elections, close to the new year. There is no clear deadline for establishing a new government, former parliamentarian Khaled Kalaldeh said. But he said it's in the prime minister's best interest to set up the new administration within 24 hours, due to a planned demonstration Friday by the opposition and the Muslim Brotherhood. Many have said Jordan's economy is hurting, and too many people cannot afford the high cost of living and are burdened by high inflation. Unemployment numbers are too high, they said, and many young people are without work. The complaints have been echoed for some time in the kingdom, and gained steam when the Arab Spring began to sweep North Africa and the Middle East in 2010 and 2011. Popular uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya have ousted longtime leaders from power. In the past two years, King Abdullah has fired four prime ministers. In February 2011, shortly before Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was forced out of office following weeks of intense protest, the king dismissed his government and ordered ""genuine political reform,"" the country's royal court reported. But the king appears to be in a tough spot. Political reforms would mean taking power away from his base -- the Bedouin tribes, a group known as the East Bankers. On top of that concern, King Abdullah is also dealing with more than 200,000 Syrian refugees who have entered Jordan recently. Last Thursday, government spokesman Samih al-Maitah framed the king's decision to dissolve parliament as part of his promised reforms. ""This was not a surprise decision,"" al-Maitah said. He added that an independent commission to oversee upcoming parliamentary elections will ensure fairness. But the dissolution of parliament didn't stop the mass protest on Friday, which was organized by the Muslim Brotherhood. The religious and political group believes Islam is not simply a religion but a way of life. It advocates a move away from secularism and a return to the rules of the Quran as a basis for healthy families, communities and states. The Brotherhood has repeatedly called for political reform in Jordan. On Wednesday, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood's political wing expressed hope for the new government. ""As far as we are concerned, we have no enmity toward any Jordanian person appointed by the king, especially for the appointment of the prime minister,"" said Nimer Assaf, deputy general secretary for the Islamic Action Front. ""We do not look for names, we look for the deeds, and we hope that this next government will go ahead with reforms which the Jordanians have been asking for a very long time.""","Abdullah Ensour is Jordan's new prime minister .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)For 62 years, if you cheated on your husband or wife in South Korea, you could end up in prison. Not anymore. South Korea's Constitutional Court on Thursday overturned a law that made adultery a crime, saying it violates the East Asian nation's constitution. ""The precondition of human dignity and right to pursue happiness is for each individual to have their rights to choose their fate,"" the court ruled, saying that one's sex life is private. ""And the rights to choose their fate includes rights to be engaged in sex and choosing the partner."" Up until then, anyone who cheated on their spouse could be charged and, if convicted, spent up to two years in prison. The same penalty also applied to ""the one who fornicated with the"" cheating spouse, according to the Constitutional Court's website. But that's changing because South Korean society has changed enough ""to lose many parts of (the anti-adultery law's) reason to exist,"" the prevailing judges said, according to a news release summarizing their decision. The chief reason for originally enacting the adultery law was to protect women, these justices contended. The idea was that men -- who tended to be economically and socially more powerful -- took advantage of women. And if a man was charged criminally, that would give women more leverage in divorce proceedings. (In other words, a wronged wife might get more compensation after deciding to drop the charges.) Yet 2015 isn't 1953, when the law first went into the affect, according to the judges. After all, the current president of South Korea -- Park Geun-hye -- is a woman. ""Women are active socially and economically, and women no longer apply as economically weaker,"" these judges wrote. ""... In addition, the law cannot be viewed as (exclusively) protecting women."" Seven judges signed on to this decision, but two dissented. The dissenting view said that legalizing adultery hurts efforts to promote family in South Korea. It points to statistics showing 40% of South Korean marriages since 2000 end in divorce. And between 2000 and 2006, at least, 47.1% of those divorces came about after one or more spouses cheated. ""Adultery and fornication go beyond a person's rights (and) intrude on other people and the community,"" these justices wrote. ""Considering that the relationship between husband and wife is the fundamental element of a family, the country and the society should legally protect and maintain (this) relationship."" The last time the South Korean court looked at this law was 2008. Since then, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap, some 5,500 people have been indicted on adultery charges, though that doesn't mean they ended up behind bars. It was not immediately clear what will happen to those cases, assuming they haven't been resolved already. But at least one entity that has reason to celebrate after Thursday's ruling, Unidus, a South Korean condom maker. It's impossible to definitively say why, but Undius' stock price did jump suddenly about 25 minutes after the decision came out. By day's end, it was up a shade under 15% from Wednesday. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from South Korea, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.","Since 1953, a South Korean could get 2 years in prison for cheating on his or her spouse .

"(CNN)Chelsea underlined its title credentials with an attacking masterclass against Swansea, Saturday. The London club moved five points clear at the top of the English Premier League table with a 5-0 victory at the Liberty Stadium. With less than a minute on the clock, Oscar fired the table toppers into the lead to ignite the goal rush. Diego Costa -- the leading scorer in the EPL with 17 goals -- added two more before Oscar bagged his second just before halftime. After goals galore there was only a single strike from Andre Schurrle to savor after the break. The German winger came off the bench to make it five for Chelsea. ""The result is impressive,"" manager Jose Mourinho told Chelsea TV. ""The performance was very good, very solid and very enjoyable."" The free flowing display by Mourinho's men was a warning to those threatening to deny Chelsea its first title since 2010. Manchester City, the defending champions, will aim to close the gap when it faces Arsenal Sunday. Elsewhere, hirsute substitute Marouane Fellaini broke the deadlock against Queen's Park Rangers to help earn Manchester United a 2-0 victory. The Belgian hammered home a 10-yard strike before James Wilson sealed victory late on. QPR once again relied upon the efforts of the lively Charlie Austin, who was tireless in his pursuit of an equalizer, but the West London club remain mired in the relegation tone. The club's unflappable manager Harry Redknapp shrugged off any worries, telling Sky Sports: ""QPR won't go down this year."" In the EPL's late game, Southampton moved into third place thanks to a 2-1 away victory at Newcastle. January on loan signing Eljero Elia scored both goals, his first for the club, in a sizzling performance. Elsewhere, in form French forward Alexandre Lacazette scored his 20th goal in 21 Ligue 1 matches to stretch Lyon's league lead. Lyon left Lens with a 2-0 victory -- Jean-Phillippe Gbamin added an own goal with an errant back heel  -- to move four points clear of Marseille at the top of the table. Lacazette is closing in on Josip Skoblar's Ligue 1 record of 44 goals scored in a single season which he set back in 1970-1971. In Italy's Serie A, title challengers Roma could only close to within two points of leaders Juventus -- who meet Verona Sunday -- after being held by Palermo. Striker Mattia Destro salvaged a point for Roma after Argentina's Paulo Dybala had put the home side ahead. Inter Milan's hopes of qualifying for the Champions League took another knock as Robert Mancini's side slid to ninth after a goalless draw at Empoli.

"(CNN) -- Public executions, death by starvation and torture are common in North Korean political prisoner camps, according to testimony given to human rights group Amnesty International. Fifteen former inmates and prison guards told Amnesty about their daily experiences in the camps, describing the lack of food, hard labor and cramped conditions. The camps -- which hold an estimated 200,000 people according to Amnesty -- also appear to be growing in size according to new satellite images obtained by the group. A satellite image taken of a camp in April was analyzed by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) against a satellite image taken in 2001, says Amnesty. Analysis shows an expansion of the number of buildings in the camp, according to the report. Amnesty says the facilities occupy vast wilderness sites in the provinces of South Pyongan, South Hamkyung and North Hamkyung and house prisoners accused of criticizing the leadership, those believed to be part of anti-government groups and even those caught listening to South Korean broadcasts. ""North Korea can no longer deny the undeniable. For decades the authorities have refused to admit to the existence of mass political prison camps,"" said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International Asia Pacific Director. ""As North Korea seems to be moving towards a new leader in Kim Jong-un and a period of political instability, the big worry is that the prison camps appear to be growing in size."" The report says tens of thousands are believed to be held at one camp simply because one of their relatives has been sent to a camp. According to testimony, every former inmate at one camp had witnessed a public execution, one child was held for eight months in a cube-like cell so small he couldn't move his body and an estimated 40% of inmates die from malnutrition. Tortures included placing a plastic bag over the head of a victim and submerging them in water, sleep deprivation, bamboo slivers under the fingernails, and suspending prisoners whose feet and hands have been bound behind them, witnesses said. One former inmate told Amnesty how he and his father were forced to witness the public execution of his mother and brother, while a former prison guard detailed how inmates would eat snakes, rats and pig feed. One former inmate told how she had picked, cleaned and eaten corn kernels from cow dung. Other testimony outlined how children at the camps were given minimal education and were often forced into heavy labor, sometimes working until they collapsed. ""If you fell sick, there were no meals because you did not produce any output,"" the report quoted one witness as saying. Aidan Foster-Carter, Honorary Senior Research Fellow in Sociology and Modern Korea at Leeds University in England, said: ""It is difficult to get hard data (on North Korea) for obvious reasons, and it could be that the numbers of people in the camps are growing. What may be happening is that as part of the changing political situation the government has conducted a purge of people opposed to the succession (of leader Kim Jong ll by his son Kim Jong-un). ""Entire families have ended up in these concentration camps for political offences. A young boy ended up in one of these camps because his grandfather had expressed political dissent. They are endemic, they are part of the system."" The North Korean government -- which has denied the existence of mass political prison camps -- has not publicly commented on the report's findings. In its most recent human rights report on North Korea, the U.S. State Department describes the country's human rights record as ""deplorable."" The report cites testimony from NGOs and refugees that claimed camps covered areas as large as 200 square miles and contained mass graves, barracks, worksites and other prison facilities. ""An NGO reported that one reeducation center was so crowded that prisoners were forced to sleep on top of each other or sitting up,"" the report, updated in March, 2010, said. ""The same NGO reported that guards at a labor camp stole food brought for inmates by their family members."" Journalists Peter Shadbolt and Thair Shaikh contributed to this story.","Testimony reveals realities of daily life in N Korean political prisoner camps .

"Los Angeles (CNN)Romel David is terrified. He and his family can't sleep, and they can't stop thinking about what will happen in Syria, thousands of miles away from the comfort of their California home. David said his brother-in-law, who emigrated to the United States about four years ago with his wife and two daughters, has been abducted by ISIS in Syria along with several other members of the family he had hoped to bring to the United States to get them out of harm's way. David said his brother-in-law decided to return to Syria two years ago to be with them as they went through the process of applying for visas to the United States. The 59-year-old and 11 other family members were among the people taken by ISIS, which has targeted Assyrian villages in Syria this week. ""We anticipate the unthinkable. It's absolutely devastating,"" David told CNN. ""It's happening; another Holocaust before our very eyes. There is nothing that we can do. But the world must do something. Please. Please, the world powers must do something for all of these people."" They are devout Christians, who like many in  their village, farmed and lived simple but hard lives off the land. They were taken hostage early Tuesday morning from Hassakeh in northeastern Syria. ISIS abducts scores of Christians in northeastern Syria, groups say . David and his family in Modesto, California, found out about their capture in a devastating phone call. An elderly Syrian man who lived nearby called. He was too sick to leave his home when everyone began fleeing as ISIS fighters stormed the villages in northeast Syria about 30 miles from the Turkish border. ""With his cell phone he called my brother-in-law's wife and my wife's sister and told him what has transpired,"" David said. The family hasn't heard from the old man since nor any of their captured family members. ""Feeling helpless is overwhelming. We can't sleep. It's devastated us. ... We fear the worst, and we pray for mercy and intervention from God,"" David said. David said ISIS was trying to exact an impossible amount of money, a tax on Christians in Syrian villages and cities they control. The amount was so high -- more than most make in five years -- it was impossible for families to pay, he said. David would not reveal his brother-in-law's name for fear that ISIS is so media savvy they would single him and his family out if they found out that his brother-in-law is indeed a legal U.S. resident. But he said his brother-in-law is man of deep conviction and could not live comfortably with only part of his family safe in the United States, a country he had come to love. ""He was happy that he was America's adopted son. He was looking forward to having his son and his son's family join him and proceeding with a life of prosperity here,"" David said. Now his mission to try to get his remaining family members to America has resulted in him being captured along with them. ""When things started falling apart, he feared for the welfare of his son and son's family. He couldn't very well be here having safe haven here so he went. He is a loving father, and a devout Christian who truly loves God. May God protect him,"" David said. ISIS has attacked numerous minority groups during a bloody campaign to create a vast caliphate across Syria and Iraq under its extreme version of Sharia law. The number of Assyrians estimated to be in captivity has climbed steadily, from an initial estimate of between 70 and 100 people seized earlier this week to 150 as of Wednesday, with women, children and the elderly among them. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the number of Assyrian hostages seized over three days at 220, in a statement released Thursday. Osama Edward, founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network, said the number is even higher -- 262. Activist: ISIS now holds 262 Christians hostages in Syria . The Assyrians are a proud people who've overcome a lot in their history. They can trace their roots back some 4,000 years to the time of Mesopotamia, considered one of the cradles of civilization and birthplace of writing and literature. While their first religion was Ashurism, Assyrians have been predominantly Christian since the third century. ""How can Syria be Syria without the Assyrians?"" Edward said. ""We gave the country our name."" The captured Assyrians have gotten the attention of Rep. Ana Eshoo, a California Democrat, who wrote a letter to President Barack Obama pleading for Washington and the United Nations to try to help secure a safe haven for religious minorities in Syria and Iraq. ""For the past decade we have been witnessing a rapid decline of Syria and Iraq's Christian communities,"" Eshoo writes. ""The situation for religious minorities in Syria and Iraq remains desperate and soon will be hopeless. We must act now."" She has proposed more safe havens inside Iraq and Syria for religious minorities, specifically in the Nineveh Plains, as well as adequate humanitarian assistance in refugee camps.

"Pasco, Washington (CNN)Two autopsies. Two different opinions as to whether an unarmed Mexican national was shot from behind by police in Pasco, Washington, earlier this month. Charles Herrmann, an attorney for the family of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, said Thursday that an autopsy conducted by a doctor he hired showed two bullets hit the 35-year-old orchard worker in the back of the arm and in the buttocks. This is at odds with what police said a day earlier. Kennewick Police Sgt. Ken Lattin had told reporters on Wednesday, ""we do know this from the preliminary autopsy report, there were no shots in the back."" Police said the medical examiner was doing further investigation and a final report might take as long as four weeks. Witness statements and toxicology reports are also pending, police said. There also is dispute over how many times total Zambrano-Montes was shot. Police said it was five or six times. The family's pathologist said he may have been shot as many as eight times, according to Hermann. Both sides appear to agree that three police officers fired 17 times at Zambrano-Montes.  Police said he hurled rocks at them on February 10. Zambrano-Montes' case has sparked local protests and anger at what some say is another example of police brutality and excessive force against an unarmed man who is a minority. Police have alleged that Zambrano-Montes was throwing rocks at cars and trucks when he was confronted by officers. Officers attempted ""voice commands and low-level force"" and used a Taser, police said, but those efforts didn't work. After two officers were hit by rocks -- at least one of them as large as a softball -- police said they shot Zambrano-Montes. Prominent attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented the families of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, announced that he and fellow attorney Jose Baez also represent Antonio Zambrano-Montes' family. Crump and Baez will hold a Friday news conference to disclose the results of an independent autopsy. The widow and children of Zambrano-Montes have filed a $25 million claim against the city of Pasco alleging that officers killed the unarmed man ""execution style."" In an interview with CNN en Español this week, Zambrano-Montes' mother, Agapita Montes, denounced police treatment of her son. ""I'm asking for justice for what happened. It was not acceptable what they did to my son,"" his mother said. ""From what you can see (on the video), it was very bad what they did to him."" Zambrano-Montes was one of 16 children, his mother said. Erlinda Zambrano, an aunt of Zambrano-Montes, said she found it very difficult to accept the police version of events. ""We are living with profound pain from how he died, and it's something very bad and terrible,"" the aunt said. ""I look at the videos now and I cannot sleep because it's too hard."" The family lawsuit claims Zambrano-Montes was unarmed ""with his hands out where they could be seen."" ""He had his back to the officers,"" the claim said. ""At this point, the officers started shooting."" The Tri-City Special Investigations Unit is still reviewing video to see if there was anything in Zambrano-Montes' hand when he was shot. When processing the scene that night of the fatal shooting, Lattin said at a news briefing, ""I think it's safe to say there was a rock found next to his body."" A funeral Mass was held for Zambrano-Montes on Wednesday in Pasco. CNN en Espanol's Jaqueline Hurtado contributed from Pasco, Washington.

"(CNN)It's hard to believe it's been 36 years since the first ""Alien"" extraterrestrial beastie burst out of John Hurt's chest and into moviegoers' nightmares. But fans of the sci-fi/horror franchise, which sputtered out with 1997's ""Alien: Resurrection,"" are still eager to see what filmmaker Neill Blomkamp can do with the material. Blomkamp, who made the respected sci-fi action thriller ""District 9"" and has a new movie, ""Chappie,"" coming out March 6, posted an Instagram message last week implying his next film will be a new ""Alien"" project. According to the Hollywood Reporter, a CNN content partner, Blomkamp will ignore the last two sequels in the series -- ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien: Resurrection"" -- and pick up the storyline after the events of the James Cameron-directed ""Aliens."" Beyond that, details about Blomkamp's ""Alien"" are still scarce. There's no word about when the film might hit theaters or whether it would bring back characters from the earlier movies -- although star Sigourney Weaver is likely to return. A Blomkamp reboot of ""Alien"" seems promising (although we haven't seen ""Chappie"" yet). Then again, Hollywood is more than capable of screwing it up. Here are five ways they could blow it. Don't cast Sigourney Weaver . Sure, someone could make a great ""Alien"" movie without her. But why would you? She's a fine actress, she wants to do it and she would lend instant credibility to the project. Luckily, Blomkamp appears to agree. Chatter about a Blomkamp ""Alien"" movie began almost two months ago when the South African filmmaker started posting ""Alien""-themed concept art to Instagram -- including images of Weaver as her Ripley character. Weaver also has a role in ""Chappie"" and has gushed about Blomkamp's talent, fueling speculation that the two will work together again. Keep the aliens exactly the same . With their skeletal bodies, armored heads, dual sets of jaws and fangs dripping with venom, the ""Alien"" xenomorphs are among the most iconic -- and freaky -- creatures in science fiction. They're also almost four decades old, originally created by H.R. Giger. We're not saying Blomkamp should replace them with something totally different. But every species evolves. Make them more cunning and even scarier looking.  It's time for a refresh. Thankfully, Blomkamp seems to have done just that with his early concept art. Have them attack Earth . Invading space aliens have been a science-fiction staple since at least 1951's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" But having a marauding alien terrorize Times Square or scamper down Sunset Boulevard would look pretty silly. The ""Alien"" movies have generated suspense largely through the claustrophobic feel of humans trapped in enclosed spaces with deadly critters who might pop out at any moment. So instead of Earth, what about this: What if an alien stowaway or two infiltrate an exclusive space colony -- like Blomkamp's own Elysium? It might be satisfying to see the toothy monsters wreak havoc on a bunch of pampered elitists. Bow to 'Prometheus' Ridley Scott's 2012 film ""Prometheus"" was a prequel of sorts to the first ""Alien."" And a rumored ""Prometheus"" sequel, if it ever happens, is expected to veer even further from the ""Alien"" mythology. Nothing against that film or against Scott, the creative force behind the ""Alien"" franchise. But Blomkamp should feel free to pursue his own vision. ""Alien: The Musical!"" Haha! Just kidding. We hope.","""District 9"" director Neill Blomkamp will make a new movie in the ""Alien"" series .
It will ignore the last two sequels and pick up the story after ""Aliens""
His concepts look promising, but here's how Hollywood could still screw it up ."
"(CNN)Iran blasted its mock-up of a U.S. aircraft carrier during naval drills on Wednesday, swarming the target with 100 speedboats armed with rockets, shoulder-launched missiles and mortars as well as striking it with cruise missiles, according to reports from Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency. Iran said the aircraft carrier target was a full-size replica of the USS Nimitz.

When U.S. officials first learned of the existence of the mock carrier last year, one described it as more akin to a Hollywood set than an actual warship. But the symbolism is clear. Nimitz-class carriers are the centerpiece of U.S. naval forces, and the largest warships in the world. Mine-laying exercises were also part of the war games, according to the Fars report. Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi, commander of the Iranian naval forces, described that portion of the games as ""the most important concern of the Americans."" ""We have the most advanced sea mines which cannot be imagined by the Americans,"" he is quoted as saying in the Fars report. Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami, lieutenant commander of the Revolutionary Guard, said Iran wasn't showing off all its capabilities during the games, according to a Fars report. ""We have capabilities which will remain covert and hidden before being used in action and we will merely use them in the battlefield,"" Salami said in the report. A U.S. Navy spokesman in Bahrain told the Associated Press that the United States ""was not concerned about this exercise."" ""We're quite confident of our naval forces' ability to defend themselves,"" Cmdr. Kevin Stephens said.

"(CNN)An Argentine judge has dismissed a criminal complaint accusing President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and other top leaders of covering up Iran's involvement in a 1994 terrorist bombing in Buenos Aires. The prosecutor who filed the case, Alberto Nisman, was found dead days after making the accusations. His death sparked outrage and conspiracy theories aplenty. Judge Daniel Rafecas on Thursday ruled that Nisman's case did not meet the minimum threshold to initiate a criminal investigation. The government has denied the accusations from the beginning, and even some journalists who have pored through Nisman's report have said the case wasn't airtight. The 63-page ruling states that ""it is clear that neither of the two hypotheses of crimes made by the prosecutor in his complaint minimally hold up."" Nisman alleged that Argentina's government agreed not to go after Iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for a favorable trade deal. The two hypotheses that the judge referred to in his ruling were some of the key arguments made by Nisman. The prosecutor argued that the Argentine government's decision in 2013 to form a joint ""truth commission"" with Iran to investigate the bombing would hinder an honest examination. The 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in the Argentine capital is the deadliest terror attack in the country's history. Eighty-five people were killed, and hundreds were injured. Nisman also alleged that Fernandez and Foreign Minister Hector Timerman sought to withdraw from Interpol their requests for the arrests of several Iranian suspects. The judge ruled that because the truth commission has never been created, it can't have functioned as an instrument to cover up anything. Regarding Interpol, the judge said there is no evidence that the Argentine government took steps to have the international police body remove the so-called red notices against the Iranians. Addressing the accusation against Fernandez, the judge wrote that ""there is not one piece of evidence, not even a hint, that points to the current President regarding the instigating or planning of the grave crime of a cover-up. ..."" Nisman was found with a gunshot wound to his head in his apartment on January 18, a day before he was scheduled to testify before lawmakers about his accusations. Authorities have yet to determine if his death was a suicide or a homicide. Earlier this month, a new prosecutor who picked up Nisman's case said there was enough evidence to continue the criminal investigation. Prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita filed a 61-page report essentially endorsing Nisman's allegations. Thursday's ruling quashed his request for the investigation to proceed. CNN's Shasta Darlington contributed to this report.","A judge dismisses the criminal case filed against Argentina's top leaders .

"(CNN)The revelations Thursday over the identity of ""Jihadi John"" -- that he apparently grew up and was educated in Britain, and that he has a degree in computing from Westminster University in London -- have left us with some profoundly troubling issues. It appears clear that security authorities have known for some time who he is, but kept this fact hidden, either, one assumes, because they were attempting to capture him or because they were trying to protect his family from vigilantes. Whatever the reason, the fact that he had the benefit of higher education (and had picked up state of the art IT skills) once again  highlights how our education system fails to protect either us, the citizens of a free country, or the students themselves from the violent horrors of Islamism. Meanwhile, the fact that many British universities this month stated they will continue to resist the proposals made by the government in the latest counterterrorism legislation (including imposing on them a duty to keep extremists off their campuses and notify the authorities if they believe their students have been brainwashed by them) is nothing short of a total national disgrace. But the news surrounding Mohammed Emwazi, identified by the Washington Post as a Kuwaiti-born Londoner, raises a few other points worth noting. First of all, by giving him a name, we give his victims' loved ones the hope that he may be captured or brought to trial at some future date. The release of his name could also deter him from further acts of unspeakable sadism, or perhaps make some of his comrades with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria rethink some of their plans. And it might even prompt some young European to think twice about going out to live and die for ISIS. This case also makes it clear that the time has now come for a new U.N. declaration or Atlantic Charter to the effect that these Islamist war criminals will be hunted down, and that retribution for their crimes will be sought, just as we pursued the Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg and elsewhere. Comprehensive lists of ISIS members should be drawn up as a matter of urgency. In addition, the time has come to review what can be done to stop young Muslim men and women from joining the ranks of the jihadis. Education has a part to play, but it is plain that whatever has been done so far has not been adequate. New, more proactive measures may be required. At the same time, it is also self-evident that education alone is not enough. Instead, we also need effective intelligence-led security policies that must include letting our intelligence agencies access electronic data in their search of jihadi recruitment campaigns. This is the only way we have to protect everyone. We know, thanks to Edward Snowden and his friends, that our ability to monitor and disrupt jihadists has declined by perhaps a third. Obviously, they continue to communicate, but either they are doing so in ways we find increasingly hard to track, or our security agencies are so fearful of being tarred as ""snoopers"" that they have become far too cautious about investigating those who want to do us grave harm. Finally, it must surely be clear to Western leaders that as long as President Barack Obama refuses to dismantle ISIS as a political entity in the only way possible -- by putting boots on the ground --  Islamism will continue to present us in the West with a monumental threat. Sadly, it is one which will grow, fueled as it is by those we have educated with great care and to whom we have taught some of our most useful skills.","Name of man believed to be ISIS militant released .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)As the avalanches continue in mountainous northeastern Afghanistan, the death toll keeps rising. For a third day in a row, heavy snowstorms caused avalanches in the Panjshir province on Thursday, bringing the total to 168, officials said. They began Tuesday, continued Wednesday and two more avalanches took place Thursday, said provincial Gov. Abdul Rahman Kabiri. Authorities fear the toll will grow much higher since rescue personnel are yet to reach the worst affected areas. Panjshir is a small, mountainous province north of the capital, Kabul. Its residents are generally poor, earning their living as farmers, shepherds or operators of small businesses such as groceries.","Authorities fear the toll will grow higher .

"(CNN)Picture a mix of your favorite movie car chase and a trip to the zoo. Two llamas were on the loose in Sun City, Arizona, Thursday, with TV cameras following them as law enforcement closed in. Of course, it didn't take long before Twitter joined in the hunt. #Llamas became a trending topic worldwide. The chase began after a 911 call came in to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office just before noon, reporting that a black llama and a white llama had escaped from an assisted living facility, where they were about to do patient therapy work. Lt. Brandon Jones said the llamas darted between cars, delaying traffic. It took nearly an hour to catch them, CNN affiliate KNXV reported. Cable news and social media go all in on #LlamaWatch . In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of tweets chimed in on the topic. NFL Network reporter Jeff Darlington couldn't contain his excitement. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers were impressed with the white llama's dodging skills. The Arizona Cardinals also saw a recruiting opportunity, posting that the llamas would soon be joining the football team's lineup. ABC news anchor Tom Llamas said he was recusing himself from covering the story. The chase sent CNN's Steve Brusk down memory lane. The Daily Beast's Asawin Suebsaeng noted that it was only a matter of time before someone blamed President Barack Obama for what happened. The official Twitter account of the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the United States Northern Command weighed in with an analysis of the llamas' motives. By Thursday night, there was already a sequel to the chase. Police said two more llamas were on the loose in Vancouver, Washington. On Twitter, some joked it was a sign there could be something more serious afoot. But in Washington, the llamas were found before CNN affiliate KPTV's chopper made it to the scene. In Arizona, citizens helped capture the llamas, who were on the way home Thursday afternoon, Jones said. ""Needless to say, they are on their way back to the ranch,"" the lieutenant said. ""There was no therapy."" The Twitterverse begged to differ. Karen Freund and Bub Bullis said their afternoon was anything but relaxing. They told CNN Phoenix affiliate KTVK they never expected their white llama, Kanita, and black llama, Lainey, to make a run for it at the retirement home on Thursday. Alejandro, a third llama they'd brought with them for the demonstration, stayed put. ""They were having a lot of fun today, but we weren't. We were totally stressed out,"" said Freund, who was wearing an ""I love llamas"" T-shirt and llama earrings as she recounted the ordeal to the station. Bullis said the chase lasted for hours -- until a landscaper with a lasso came to the rescue. It's not the first time they've had to chase down a suspect. The llamas' owners are both retired police officers. ""I have run after people before,"" Bullis said, ""but never that fast."" Now, with their llamas' whereabouts pinned down, they're starting to enjoy the Internet frenzy. ""It's pretty funny to have our llamas get loose in Sun City and get this kind of attention,"" Bullis said. Freund told KTVK she's already taken an online quiz to find out whether she's a black or white llama. ""I was the black llama,"" she said, laughing.

"(CNN)When people are faced with overwhelming trauma in their lives, some become consumed by their difficulties, while others emerge stronger for it.  In special circumstances, they may find their destiny, and seek to heal the world and make all of us stronger. Myrlie Evers-Williams and Sybrina Fulton are two great women whose achievements demand our attention.  Although their personal stories are separated by five decades, these women share parallel lives.  Thrust into a position of leadership for the greater good of society, they have used personal grief over the loss of a loved one to become agents for change. Each of these extraordinary women experienced unthinkable tragedy: the killing of a black man in their life who was gunned down while still young. Recently, the two women met in person for the taping of a video for CNN and theGrio. Evers-Williams is the widow of Medgar Evers, the iconic civil rights leader who served as the field secretary for the NAACP in Mississippi.  On June 12, 1963, Evers, who fought against discrimination and segregation and led voter registration efforts, was assassinated by a white supremacist named Byron De La Beckwith, a founder of the state's White Citizens Council. Evers, 37, was shot in the back while in his driveway after coming from an NAACP meeting. The Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a state agency that spied on the civil rights movement and was complicit in the death of civil rights workers, assisted Beckwith's lawyers.  Evers' murder received national attention and was a factor leading to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. For the Evers family, the fear of Medgar's murder was ever present.  ""Both Medgar and I knew the day would soon be upon us when he would be killed, and that last night that we had together, I said, 'I can't make it without you,' '' Evers-Williams said.  ""And he told me 'You're stronger than you think you are.'"" Following her husband's death, Evers-Williams emerged as a civil rights leader in her own right, serving as chairwoman of the NAACP in 1995 and helping to revive what was then a financially troubled, debt-ridden civil rights organization.  She has continued the fight for those things that were important to her husband. Evers-Williams served on the NAACP board for 30 years and was awarded the organization's Spingarn medal, served as editor of ""The Autobiography of Medgar Evers: A Hero's Life and Legacy Revealed Through His Writings, Letters, and Speeches"", and through the establishment of the Medgar and Myrlie Evers Institute, she has kept his legacy alive.  On January 21, 2013, she delivered the invocation at President Obama's second inauguration, becoming the first layperson and the first woman to serve in that capacity. Further, Evers-Williams sought justice for Medgar through Beckwith's 1994 murder conviction, following two trials with deadlocked all-white male juries 31 years earlier. ""All of us have a job to do, and mine has been to rear those three children, to be a strong, loving but strict mother, to give to society, to give back to Medgar,"" she said. Meanwhile, not unlike Myrlie Evers-Williams, Sybrina Fulton found her calling through grief nearly 50 years later.  Three years ago, on February 26, 2012, Fulton's son, Trayvon Martin, was shot to death by George Zimmerman, a self-proclaimed neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida.  Martin, 17, was visiting his father, and Zimmerman, who is a Latino of Afro-Peruvian and German ancestry, claimed Martin looked suspicious and killed the black teen, invoking self-defense.  The police would not arrest Zimmerman for several weeks. In July 2013, a jury acquitted Zimmerman of second-degree murder.  The case shone the national spotlight on the killing of innocent, unarmed African-Americans such as Martin, who was armed with nothing more than a pack of Skittles and an iced tea. Sybrina Fulton realized the need to fight not only for justice for her own son, but also for other families and their children as well.  ""When this initially happened to Trayvon, we thought this was about Trayvon,"" Fulton said.  Then, when she saw how many lives were touched by Trayvon's death, she became a voice for the voiceless, like others before her. ""We have to speak out for those people, just like Trayvon, and just like Dr. King, and just like Medgar; they were sacrifices for better lives in a better world."" Fulton founded the Trayvon Martin Foundation, and has reached out to others such as the family of Michael Brown, 17, who was fatally shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri, while unarmed on August 9, 2014.  Last year, she testified before the United Nations in Geneva on racial discrimination in the United States. In addition, Fulton has spoken out against ""Stand Your Ground"" laws, which are often used to claim self-defense by whites who shoot African-Americans. Zimmerman's lawyers did not raise the stand your ground defense at trial, but a juror admitted the jury had discussed the law before acquitting him.  Further, the judge's instructions to the jury included mention of the law. In the eyes of many, these laws have ushered in an open season on black men—and women.  ""It just amazes me how God is using me to go from that average life, and using me to be a vessel to speak to so many people.  I would not voluntarily give my son's life, and the loss of his life was because of the color of his skin. I feel like I just have to do my part,"" Fulton said. Despite the half century separating the death of Medgar Evers and Trayvon Martin, the grieving women-turned-activists have lived and struggled under similar circumstances.  And the more America has changed, the more it has remained the same. Whether during the Jim Crow era or 21st century America, the lives of black people have been under siege, their bodies devalued.  Then and now, African-Americans have faced lynching at the hands of white men, whether police officers, self-proclaimed cops, vigilantes, mobs or domestic terrorists who were empowered to take matters into their own hands. History is about change, and yet it represents a continuum as well,  with injustice likely to repeat itself, particularly if society fails to heed its lessons.  As we celebrate progress, we must also acknowledge the relentless nature of injustice, and the need to remain vigilant in order to eradicate it. The two black women both have faced a fight against what the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. called unjust laws. The regime of Jim Crow segregation was an attempt to block the full freedom of black Americans and stifle their aspirations, backed by the authority of the government and the courts, and secured through the threat of violence. People such as Medgar Evers were willing to take the risk of becoming martyrs to break down those arbitrary, oppressive laws. However, today the country is witnessing a backlash against progress, with a rollback of the civil rights legislation of the 1960s, restrictions on the right to vote, and gun laws that endanger black lives such as that of Trayvon Martin.  Unjust laws have turned America into a nation of entrenched poverty and heightened economic inequality, unparalleled gun homicide and the largest prison population in the world. Meanwhile, in the midst of a nascent, multiracial #BlackLivesMatter movement led by black women, Myrlie Evers-Williams and Sybrina Fulton continue the struggle and teach a new generation of leaders. ""Life does go on, but we must never forget that we cannot stop at one point, that it calls us to continue,"" said Evers-Williams. ""And there are young people out there who need to be reached, who need to know what this is about, and who will eventually dedicate themselves to justice, to peace, to equality and to love."" During Black History Month, we are reminded that civil rights martyrs become catalysts for new movements.  And great women lead and transform the world.","Three years after Trayvon Martin's killing, his mother meets Medgar Evers' widow .

"(CNN)Dori J. Maynard, who as president of the Robert C. Maynard Institute for Journalism Education was dedicated to expanding diversity in newsrooms and excellence in journalism, died Tuesday, according to a statement on the institute's website. She was 56. The cause of death was complications from lung cancer, her family told the Bay Area News Group, which runs the Oakland Tribune, the newspaper her father edited and later owned. Maynard was once asked what her middle initial, ""J,"" stood for. ""Journalism,"" she responded, and in a long career in the field she worked as a reporter for such papers as the Bakersfield Californian and the Detroit Free Press. But it was as the head of the Oakland-based Maynard Institute -- co-founded by her father, a longtime journalist who became the first African-American to own a major metropolitan newspaper -- that she had the greatest impact, colleagues said. ""She's the kind of person who understood how this idea of diversity was so vital today and continues to be vital and needed to change from our old ways of thinking of what that meant and how to implement it in the production of news and the way we think about news,"" longtime friend Sally Lehrman told the Oakland Tribune. ""She was always thinking about work because she loved it and it was such a part of her."" ""Dori was fearless,"" added Dawn Garcia, managing director of Stanford University's John S. Knight Journalism Fellowships. Maynard was concerned that there were blind spots in traditional metropolitan newsrooms and worked to correct them. ""There is one often overlooked reason why the industry continues to struggle to retain journalists of color. It is because the news organizations that essentially serve as moderators of the nation's conversations have yet to learn how to talk about and across their own racial fault lines,"" she wrote in an essay in 2003. The Maynard Institute had a variety of programs to address these issues, including a ""diversity framework that looks at diversity through the prisms of race, class, gender, generation, and geography,"" she told Harvard's Shorenstein Center. ""African-Americans are primarily (portrayed) in crime, sports and entertainment (stories). Latinos (through) episodic coverage of immigration. Native Americans and Asian Americans apparently just don't contribute to the daily fabric of our lives. ... We're spending some time trying to raise that issue,"" she continued. Friends and colleagues expressed sadness at her death. ""You can hardly put into words how important the work Dori and the Maynard Institute did to train young people of color for careers in journalism and how the institute trained the media to write fair stories about communities of color,"" wrote Bob Butler, a San Francisco radio reporter and the president of the National Association of Black Journalists, in a comment on the Maynard Institute's website. Maynard was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1993. Her father had a Nieman in 1966, making the pair the first father-daughter pair to earn that honor.

"(CNN)The pearls?! The swine! The $150,000 pearl-studded gown worn by actress Lupita Nyong'o to Sunday's Academy Awards was stolen Wednesday from her hotel room in West Hollywood, California. Detectives on Thursday were investigating the theft at the London, a luxury hotel just off Sunset Boulevard, said Lt. William Nash of the L.A. County Sheriff's Department. The theft was first reported by TMZ. Nyong'o made an immediate fashion splash when she hit the Oscars red carpet in the plunging custom Calvin Klein gown encrusted with 6,000 white Akoya pearls.

"Washington (CNN)The Obama administration's most significant legislative achievement is now, once again, teetering before the Supreme Court. The justices aren't weighing the fate of the entire statute this time. In fact, the dispute concerns what Congress meant in just four words in one section of the law. But the impact could be nearly as dramatic. In 2012, the Affordable Care Act barely survived a constitutional challenge when Chief Justice John Roberts stunned conservatives and voted along with the court's four liberal justices to uphold the law. Health chief: No plan if Obamacare overruled . On March 4, the justices will gather again to hear a challenge to the law, based on the validity of subsidies in the form of tax breaks, that could affect millions of Americans. The health care law provides for the establishment of ""exchanges"" through which individuals can purchase competitively priced health insurance. It also authorizes federal tax credits to low- and middle-income Americans to help offset the cost of the policies. Currently 16 states plus the District of Columbia have set up their own exchanges; the remaining 34 states rely on exchanges run by the federal government. Those bringing the case say that the words ""established by the State"" in a subsection of the law make clear that subsidies are only available to those living in the 16 states that set up their own exchanges. They say the IRS -- one of the agencies charged with implementing the law -- was wrong to offer tax credits to individuals who live in states that only have federally run exchanges. In their eyes, the only exchanges that comport with the letter of the law are those established by the states themselves. If the court says the IRS rule is invalid, absent some kind of action by the states or Congress, more than 5 million individuals will no longer be eligible for the subsidies, shaking up the individual market. The stakes are high. Though a ruling against the government wouldn't nullify the law, it could destabilize it. If millions of Americans were to lose the tax subsidies, and as a result not buy insurance, it would cause premiums to skyrocket in the individual market because there would be less healthy people in the pool. It would then be up to Congress to fix the law or states to set up their own exchanges. Just Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell warned that if the government loses, it has no plan B to ""undo the massive damage."" The challengers say that Congress limited the subsidies in order to encourage the states to set up their own exchanges. But when only a few states acted, the IRS tried to ""fix"" the law and wrote a rule allowing subsidies for those living in states with state-run exchanges as well as states with federally run exchanges. ""If the rule of law means anything,"" wrote Michael Carvin, a lawyer for the challengers, in court briefs, ""it is that text is not infinitely malleable and that agencies must follow the law as written -- not revise it to 'better' achieve what they assume to have been Congress's purposes."" Carvin stressed that even though the case is ""socially consequential"" and ""politically sensitive,"" the court must look at what precisely the law says. ""Under those principles, it is clear that the IRS rule must fall,"" he said. Congressional opponents of the ACA such as Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn agree. In a friend-of-the-court brief, they argued that the executive branch improperly encroached on Congress' lawmaking function and that the IRS interpretation ""opens the door to hundreds of billions of dollars of additional government spending."" Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. said that the language at issue is a ""term of art"" and that Congress always intended the subsidies to be available to everyone. Verrilli said it was ""abundantly clear"" that some states would not establish their own exchanges and that if the challengers win, those living in states with federally facilitated exchanges would ""face the very death spirals the Act was structured to avoid."" The legislators who actually crafted the law agree with Verrilli. The challengers' assertion is ""inconsistent with the text and history of the statute,"" they argued. In addition, 22 states filed a brief saying that if the challengers prevail, insurance markets throughout the country will be disrupted and the law may not be able to operate as a ""comprehensive nationwide program."" If the challengers win, individuals living in the 34 states that opted not to establish exchanges would face the loss of their subsidies. In 2014, more than 5.3 million Americans selected an insurance plan through one of the federally facilitated plans. Enrollment for 2015 is still in progress, but in court briefs the government said that nearly 7 million customers have selected or been re-enrolled in a plan through a federally facilitated exchange and ""coverage throughout the exchanges is expected to continue to increase substantially in the coming years."" Those living in states with their own exchanges would not be in danger of losing their subsidies as a result of a ruling against the government. But if the system is destabilized elsewhere, all bets are off. The plaintiffs in the case are residents of Virginia, one of the 34 states that declined to establish its own exchange. David King, Douglas Hurst, Brenda Levy and Rose Luck all signed declarations with the Supreme Court that they didn't want to purchase ACA-compliant health insurance in 2014. The crux of their argument is that if it were not for the tax credits for premiums, they could not afford health insurance and thus would be exempt from the individual mandate to purchase health insurance. But in order to bring the challenge, the plaintiffs have to show that they have the ""standing"" or legal right to be in court. This means that they have to have been harmed by the government action. Although the lower courts dismissed the government's argument that the plaintiffs didn't have standing, the media and others have uncovered information that could raise new questions. It turns out, for example, that two of the plaintiffs are veterans and could be eligible for health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs, though they signed a declaration swearing that they weren't eligible for government insurance. If they were, they wouldn't have to buy insurance through the exchange. As things stand now, however, the government has not pressed the issue before the Supreme Court. But the justices themselves might be interested in the issue, which could potentially derail the case.","Affordable Care Act finds its future hinging once again on a Supreme Court decision .

In a lengthy, strongly-worded statement, the lawyers for Choudhury called the accusations ""lurid"" and said they were made to  ""apparently to exploit the legal system for financial gain."" ""The women did not independently come forward to tell their stories of sexual assault after years of keeping them secret,"" the statement said. ""Instead, they signed on to become plaintiffs in these cases following a world-wide and lengthy period of solicitation through letters and social media seeking to convince women to sue Mr. Choudhury."" Choudhury is the founder of Bikram's Yoga College of India. He's featured prominently on its website, which details his system of performing 26 unique yoga poses while in a very hot room. The organization offers teacher trainings, which is where Choudhury allegedly met and groomed several victims. The latest lawsuit was filed this month by a woman identified as Jill Lawler. In the suit, she's described as a bright, driven woman who fell in love with Bikram Yoga almost from her first class. She begged her parents to let her borrow money from her college fund to attend a grueling nine-week teacher training, which cost $10,000 at the time. She started the course in April 2010. The alleged abuse started very soon after. According to the lawsuit, it began with the married Choudhury trying to put his hand inside Lawler's pants, eventually escalating to rape, which continued for years. ""She was ashamed, and embarrassed. She did not think that anyone would believe her, and she was afraid that if Defendant Bikram Choudhury heard that she had told, that he would kick her out of training and she would have lost both the $10,000 from her college fund, and her ability to work as a yoga instructor in order to pay for college,"" the suit reads. It accuses Choudhury of rape at that training, and at a variety of other locations, including India, where he visited Lawler in 2013. The suit says Lawler feared speaking out earlier because she needed her Bikram Yoga certification to support herself. She was also physically afraid of Choudhury. Choudhury's lawyers said they have not yet been served with Lawler's suit. ""Mr. Choudhury and the College have been successful in getting dismissed at an early stage multiple claims by several of the plaintiffs and awaiting decisions on other claims,"" they added. Shea told CNN the six cases won't be combined because each woman has a different story. The accounts share certain similarities -- something that Choudhury's lawyers seized on as proof that the accusations were false. ""The stories told by plaintiffs in their lawsuits are near copies of one another; they are all authored by the same lawyer who recruited them,"" their statement read. Larissa Anderson started practicing Bikram Yoga when she was 22. According to her civil suit, she came to yoga from a history of sexual trauma and felt that it allowed her to reconnect and reclaim her body. Anderson went to Los Angeles in 2006 where, the suit says, Choudhury raped her at his home with his wife and children upstairs. ""Larissa was broken and traumatized. She felt sick to her stomach but too scared of Bikram to say anything. He was too powerful for her to go against,"" the lawsuit reads. It alleges she was assaulted again in 2011. That time, Anderson refused Choudhury's advances but, as a result, was retaliated against in her business, the suit says. ""There have been women, suffering in silence, who now feel that there is security in numbers,"" said Shea, adding that she wouldn't be surprised if more victims step forward. ""We are moving in the right direction. We are confident, and we believe in our clients, and I believe in the justice system,"" she said. ""Truth will prevail.""

"(CNN)Reports Wednesday that three men have been arrested over plans to travel from New York to join ISIS -- and that one of them allegedly posted online about his desire to shoot the President of the United States -- is simply the latest reminder that terrorist groups and their sympathizers are exploiting the freedom of cyberspace. Earlier this month, ISIS posted a video of its horrific burning of a captured Jordanian pilot. Unfortunately, this was not the first time ISIS has used Twitter, an American social media company, to broadcast its barbaric acts to the world. In August, when ISIS released the gruesome beheading of American journalist James Foley, it also used social media. In fact, ISIS has been using Twitter for years. Nor is ISIS the only terrorist group on Twitter. Hamas, Hezbollah and the al Qaeda branch in Syria, al-Nusra Front, are all on Twitter. On January 14, the al Qaeda branch in Yemen, known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula or simply AQAP, claimed responsibility via Twitter for the terrorist attacks in Paris that killed 17 people. The group has two official accounts on Twitter. There are many more examples from such groups, all of which have officially been listed as foreign designated terrorist organizations by the U.S. government. It's with this reality in mind that on January 27, my subcommittee held a hearing on terrorists' use of social media. At those hearings, experts detailed how terrorist use of social media platforms has long been a problem. If social media is being used to help radicalize thousands of people and raise millions of dollars from many more, the question all this raises is this: Why is no one shutting them down? Because American companies aren't. And nor is the American government. I've heard two arguments for why we should keep the status quo. The first -- and easiest to set aside -- is the claim that if the U.S. government were to shut down terrorists' social media accounts, these measures would be violating terrorists' free speech rights. My own belief is that the Constitution does not apply to terrorists. These thugs gave up their right to free speech the first time they killed innocent civilians. We should certainly not be helping them kill more. But this isn't just my thinking. The Supreme Court has already held this to be the case in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, when it ruled that if someone has aided a terrorist organization, their free speech rights were not protected. Indeed, free speech does not apply when it harms others, such as creating and distributing child pornography. The second argument is that terrorists' use of social media provides the intelligence community with information that they would not otherwise be able to acquire. But while terrorists may slip up from time to time, they are also aware that by its very nature, social media is about sharing, which means what they say can easily become widely shared. Nor is terrorist use of social media a new phenomenon. We have had years to weigh the kind of intelligence that we can gather about terrorist groups against the advantages in messaging and recruitment that terrorists gain from it. And from what I have heard, allowing this public, online jihad to continue has provided no significant intelligence breakthroughs. The fact that there are more terrorists using social media than ever before should say all we need to know about whether they are benefiting from it. To put it bluntly, private American companies should not be operating as the propaganda megaphone of foreign terrorist organizations. So what needs to change? For a start, social media companies themselves need to do more. It is not good enough to only pay attention when bad press threatens a company's public image after something truly horrific is posted online. Instead, companies not only have a public responsibility but a legal obligation to do more. Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act states that it is unlawful to provide a designated foreign terrorist organization with ""material support or resources,"" including ""any property, tangible or intangible, or services."" That's about as comprehensive as you can get. What's more, most social media companies already have terms of service with prohibition of threats of violence that would preclude terrorist use of their platforms. But companies need to do a better job of enforcing their own terms. The lack of child pornography or stolen copyrighted material on social media platforms -- content that is quickly removed if it appears at all -- demonstrates what these companies can do. With this in mind, they would do well to consider having dedicated teams that remove terrorist content, and also streamline reporting processes for offensive content so users can easily report terrorist use on their platforms. Companies have the technology and the resources to crack down on terrorists' use of their platform; they just need the motivation to act. This is where the federal government can assist. In 2011, the White House promised a strategy to prevent online radicalization. But more than three years later -- and despite a summit last week aimed at tackling extremism -- we are still waiting on a that strategy. Without one, the federal government's efforts to combat terrorist use of social media will be as haphazard and lackluster as the efforts of private social media companies. Instead, we need a strategy that clearly articulates our goals and roles, and the responsibilities of each federal agency that needs to be involved, as well as how we are going to work with civil society. It is mindboggling to think that those who behead and burn others alive are able to use our own companies against us to further their cause. But that is exactly what is occurring. American newspapers would have never allowed the Nazis to place an ad for recruitment during World War II. Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations should not be allowed to use private American companies to reach billions of people with their violent propaganda in an instant, all for free.","ISIS and other terrorist groups have been active on social media .

"Jerusalem (CNN)A day after flames scorched a West Bank mosque, a Jerusalem seminary belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church was torched and defaced Thursday -- an act police suspect is the work of radical right-wing Israelis. Both buildings were defaced with anti-Arab and anti-Christian slurs, including graffiti maligning Jesus on the seminary, said police spokeswoman Luba Samri. And in each case, there was writing in Hebrew referring to the ""redemption of Zion"" and ""revenge."" The acts drew strong condemnation. ""There is no room for such deplorable activity in Jerusalem,"" Mayor Nir Barkat said Thursday. ""We must eradicate this behavior and bring those responsible to justice."" Palestine Liberation Organization official Hanan Ashrawi called the acts ""hate crimes (that) constitute a flagrant attack on all Palestinians, whether Muslim or Christian."" ""These are not isolated incidents, but rather they fit a longstanding pattern of deliberate provocation, extremism and violence, and are a vicious assault on all Palestinians and their holy sites,"" Ashrawi said. ""The recent events indicate that a holy war is already being waged against the Palestinian Muslim and Christian population."" The incident at the mosque may be a ""price tag"" attack -- a term used by radical Israeli settlers to denote reprisal attacks against Palestinians in response to moves by the Israeli government to evacuate illegal West Bank outposts -- according to officials. In fact, video from the West Bank shows two letters that translate to PT, for ""price tag."" And authorities suspect a Jewish nationalist motive for what happened at the Greek Orthodox seminary. Samri, the Israeli police spokeswoman, said that firefighters managed to douse the fire in that building's restroom and showers before anyone was injured. But not much more is known than that. Shortly after the incident, a Jerusalem district court issued a gag order that covered all details of the investigation and anything that identifies suspects.

"(CNN)Dr. John Allen, a gastroenterologist, had to morph into a detective when 10 of his patients came down with the exact same type of rare bacterial infection. Alarmed and mystified, he and his colleagues rushed to find the source of the highly lethal superbug. The culprit, it turned out, was in his own office: a device called a duodenoscope used to check out tiny ducts in the intestinal tract. The pseudomonas bacteria had somehow evaded the standard cleaning process, and it infected one patient after another. If this sounds familiar, it's because duodeonoscopes were also the cause of recent infections and deaths at UCLA. But Allen's patients in Minnesota were infected in 1987 -- and now doctors and members of Congress say they're concerned the Food and Drug Administration might have missed the problem for decades. CRE outbreak: You're due to go in for a procedure. Should you? ""This problem has been known since at least 1987,"" said Allen, the president of the American Gastroenterological Association. ""It certainly is disturbing that a fundamental design issue with these scopes would cause problems for this long."" On Thursday, the FDA issued advice to hospitals that in addition to following the manufacturer's cleaning instructions, they should ""meticulously"" clean by hand the specific portion of the device believed to harbor the bacteria. According to FDA spokewoman Leslie Wooldridge, this is the first time the FDA communicated such advice for duodenoscopes. On Monday, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-California, called for congressional hearings. ""For the life of me, I don't understand why the FDA didn't issue this advice until now,"" he said. ""I want to know what the FDA knew and when did they know it."" Understanding CRE, the 'nightmare' superbug . Dr. William Maisel, deputy director of science and chief scientist at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said it wasn't until 2013 that there was ""convincing evidence"" that duodenoscopes could harbor antibiotic-resistant infections even when the manufacturer's cleaning instructions were followed properly, and the agency issued the advisory last week after doing research ""so we felt we understood the issue sufficiently."" Over the years, the FDA also received dozens of reports about infections from duodenoscopes. ""We receive a million adverse event reports [on various devices] each year, and we evaluate the reports based on the information that's provided,"" he said. But outside the FDA, there was significant concern before 2013 that duodenoscopes -- in particular a small mechanism called the elevator wire -- were difficult if not impossible to clean thoroughly. In 2010, safety expert Lawrence Muscarella published an article in the journal Endoscopy calling for special attention to the elevator wire, and in 2011, a consortium of medical societies warned that automatic cleaning processes didn't always effectively disinfect duodenoscopes and so manual cleaning should be performed. But some experts question whether even the most meticulous and diligent manual cleaning will get all the bacteria. After an outbreak in 2013, a hospital in Illinois tried to get the highly lethal superbug CRE out of a duodenoscope and failed, according to Allen. ""They really went to extremes, but they still couldn't decontaminate the scope, and they finally had to just destroy it,"" said Allen, now the clinical chief of digestive diseases at Yale School of Medicine. Doctors hope that manufacturers will come up with a plan soon. ""I do think it will take a redesign of the scope to solve the problem, or new sterilization technology,"" said Dr. Bret Peterson, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic and lead author of the 2011 guidelines from the medical societies. Olympus, which manufactured the scope used at UCLA, did not respond to CNN's requests for comments specific to this story. ""This is clearly a matter that needs addressing,"" said Dr. John Greene, an infectious disease expert at the Moffitt Cancer Center who published an article in 2013 on a duodenoscope outbreak in Tampa. ""We really should have done this sooner.""","Duodeonoscopes were the cause of recent superbug infections and deaths at UCLA .

"(CNN)Was it the alleged smoking gun? Four weeks into testimony against murder suspect Aaron Hernandez, the prosecution is beginning to link together certain elements of the case against the former New England Patriot. In a Massachusetts court Tuesday, during testimony by one of three cleaning ladies in the Hernandez household, prosecutors showed video of  Hernandez's fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, taking a trash bag from the house and placing it in the trunk of her sister's car. Her sister, Shaneah Jenkins, was the girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd, a semipro football player, at the time of his murder. Lloyd, 27, was shot once in the back and six times in the front in June 2013, with the final two bullets fired as he lay face up, according to the medical examiner. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty. The murder weapon has not been found. Aaron Hernandez's downward spiral . In the video shown to the jury Tuesday, Jenkins appears to walk out the back patio door of the Hernandez home carrying a heavy, black trash bag. At one point, she puts it down, and places a pile of clothes into the bag, picks it up again, and goes to the garage. One of her maids then moves a white van out of the way to clear a path for Jenkins. Jenkins then hoists the bag into the trunk of her sister's car. Prosecutors allege Jenkins may have been following instructions from Hernandez to get rid of the murder weapon from their home by removing the gun inside a box, putting it in a black trash bag, and borrowing her sister's car to dispose of the bag in a dumpster. According to court documents, Jenkins doesn't remember where she took the bag. Jenkins, who was Hernandez's high school sweetheart, has pleaded not guilty to charges of lying to a grand jury several times about the presence of guns in the couple's North Attleboro home, among other issues. She could face jail time if found guilty of perjury. She has pleaded not guilty. In an effort to prevent her from pleading the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination, prosecutors have granted Jenkins immunity, compelling her to testify when they call her as witness in Lloyd's murder. Prosecutors allege that on the day after Lloyd was killed, Jenkins got a coded text message from Hernandez. Hernandez asked Jenkins to get something out of their basement, according to search warrants. ""Go ... in back of the screen in movie room when u (sic) get home an (sic) there is a box ... jus (sic) in case u were looking for it!!! Member (sic) how you ruined the big tv ... WAS JUST THINKIN bout that lol wink wink love u TTYL....K"" TTYL is shorthand for ""talk to you later."" In court, jurors have been shown stills from another home surveillance video in the home. Referring to the pictures, Shaneah Jenkins described how her sister carried a trash bag to the basement. Prosecutors allege Jenkins placed the gun inside the garbage bag, covered it with children's clothing, and carried it to the car before driving away. Shayanna Jenkins borrowed her sister's car to dispose of the bag -- something her sister told investigators she had never done before. When Jenkins returned home, she was captured on the same security system, but without the bag. Jenkins told a grand jury she threw it in a dumpster, but couldn't remember where, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors suspect the still-missing murder weapon was inside. Hernandez's lawyers have argued there's no way of knowing what was in the box. ""I mean, who knows?"" Hernandez co-counsel Jamie Sultan told the court in 2014. ""It could be drugs. It could be something that was connected to this crime that he knew about, that he was covering up for somebody else after the fact. There are all kinds of possibilities.""","Prosecution begins to tie together elements in case against Aaron Hernandez .

"(CNN)ISIS has seized even more Assyrian Christian hostages after taking over nearly a dozen Assyrian villages in northeastern Syria in the past few days, an activist said Thursday. The Sunni extremist group now holds 262 Assyrians captive, said Osama Edward, founder of the Assyrian Human Rights Network. ""ISIS is taking over more and more Assyrian towns,"" he said. The number has climbed steadily, from an initial estimate of between 70 and 100 people seized on Monday to 150 as of Wednesday, with women, children and the elderly among them. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the number of Assyrian hostages seized over three days at 220, in a statement released Thursday. They were taken from 11 villages in the Tal Tamer area in al-Hasakah Province, the monitoring group said. Its information indicates that ISIS has taken them to the Mount Abdelaziz area, southwest of Tal Tamer. Edward, who is based in Sweden but has family in the area attacked by the terror group, said Wednesday his information was coming from the Assyrian Human Rights Network's team on the ground. Edward has said he fears the hostages may face the same fate as as Assyrians targeted in Iraq and the more than 20 members of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority slaughtered by ISIS in Libya last month. Besides those captured by ISIS militants, thousands of families have been forced to flee their homes, he said. After years caught up in the middle of a civil war, many of these Assyrians lack food, water, blankets and other basics. Sharlet and Romel David, in Modesto, California, told CNN affiliate KCRA that 12 of their family members in Syria are believed to be among those kidnapped by ISIS early on Monday, and they fear for their safety. ""We pray, we pray all the time,"" said Romel. ""What we've heard is it was like a sea of black uniforms marching through all the villages, burning down the churches, desecrating the crosses and wreaking havoc."" Sharlet said her 59-year-old brother had left his job as a car salesman in Modesto two years ago for Syria, to try to bring his son and family back to the United States. Instead, they are thought to be among those held. The Davids are not naming their relatives for fear it could put them in greater danger. ""I just want them to be safe,"" said Sharlet. The Assyrians are a proud people who've overcome a lot in their history. They can trace their roots back some 4,000 years to the time of Mesopotamia, considered one of the cradles of civilization and birthplace of writing and literature. While their first religion was Ashurism, Assyrians have been predominantly Christian since the third century. ""How can Syria be Syria without the Assyrians?"" Edward said. ""We gave the country our name."" ISIS has proven, time and again, its willingness to ruthlessly go after minority groups which don't subscribe to its extreme take on Islam. Some of their targets -- the Assyrians included -- have taken up arms in an attempt to defend their communities, fighting alongside Kurdish militia, which have made some recent gains against ISIS in Syria's northeast. But ISIS has faced some opposition. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, members of the Kurdish YPG -- or People's Protection Units -- had taken control of 70 villages in al-Hasakah Province as of Wednesday. They're on the cusp of taking some inhabited by Assyrians and were clashing with ISIS forces around Tal Tamer, the monitoring group reported.

"(CNN)The world's busiest airport has started screening employee bags before allowing workers into secure areas and shutting down access doors to the airfield in the wake of a gun-smuggling operation, CNN has confirmed. Until recently, Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport had about 70 access points for what's called ""back of the airport"" employees, including baggage handlers and ramp workers. The workers were not subject to bag and body check screening when going to work. Before the new measures, employees only had to swipe their badges to gain access to secure areas of the airport. Now private security guards are checking their bags and personal belongings before they are allowed to enter a security door at the main terminal. ""There's a phased-in approach to get to full employee screening,"" airport spokesman Reese McCranie said. A day in the life of the Atlanta airport . In addition, after a CNN inquiry, airport officials closed one access point to the ramp used by Delta Air Lines employees arriving for work on the lower level of the airport. The employees have to punch in an access code to the door, and once inside, swipe their badges to go through another door. They still have access to the outer door, but the second inside door that leads to the ramp is now restricted. Delta subcontractors confirmed to CNN that employees could access the airfield after punching in their code and going through another door. ""Yeah, they can get into the terminal,"" the employee said. ""The break room allows you to go through a door where they have access to the mezzanine. The mezzanine is the outside where the planes are, it's where they do their work. They have other elevators that they can go through that'll take them up to the terminal."" Within days of CNN's visit, the airport restricted access. ""The area that we visited ... that leads from the Delta break room to the baggage make-up area is being locked down,"" McCranie told CNN. ""It will remain an emergency exit per fire code. If anyone tries to access it, the door alarm will be activated and recorded on CCTV (closed-circuit television).  The only personnel that will now have access to this door will be emergency responders (police and fire department)."" Delta said that due to the sensitive nature of security protocols, it could not discuss specifics, but noted that ""safety and security are always Delta's top priority and we are continually engaged with DHS, TSA and other stakeholders to enhance strategy and tactics across the airline's global operation."" The airport plans to reduce the number of employee access points from about 70 to 10, McCranie said. In addition, secure area access has been cut for about 4,400 employees who work for companies at the airport. Those employees will now have to go through Transportation Security Administration screening. Federal agents broke up a gun smuggling operation at Atlanta's airport in December, arresting a Delta baggage handler and passenger. The baggage handler was able to bring guns to work in a satchel, enter the gate area and pass the weapons to a passenger who had already gone through security, according to an arrest warrant affidavit and officials. The passenger transported guns on about 20 Delta flights from Atlanta to New York last year, the affidavit said. A CNN investigation found that only two major airports in the United States -- Miami and Orlando -- conduct full employee screening, requiring all employees with secure access to pass through metal detectors. Following a January congressional hearing about airport employee screening, the Atlanta airport's general manager, Miguel Southwell, said he wanted to move toward full screening. ""It can't be a one size fits all,"" Southwell said. ""In addition to the background checks as an employee, there's an enormous amount of training that goes on.

"Sierra Vista, Arizona (CNN)They are sleek, mostly silent converted weapons of war: Drones used by the Border Patrol to scan the skies in the empty deserts of the Southwest to spot illegal immigrants and then, if things work out, have agents arrest them. That's the idea, and the agents who use them say the drones give them a vantage point they never had before.

But it's outrageously expensive:  $28,000 for a single arrest. That figure comes from doing the math, derived from the most recent Inspector General report on the use of drones for the Department of Homeland Security. The report found that operating nine drones in 2013 cost taxpayers $62.5 million.  Those same nine drones are credited with apprehending just 2,272 suspects, or less than 2% of the total arrests by Customs and Border Protection in the area the drones operate. Email your story ideas and tips to CNNtips@cnn.com. In its first eight years of operations, the CBT drone program has cost $360 million. The drones are exactly like the ones used by the military in operations across Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and other battle zone countries, except there are no missiles on board. But the sophisticated equipment is also temperamental. The drones are sensitive to weather. They're also grounded about 80% of the time because of budget issues, according to the Inspector General. The report also says the drones only patrol 170 miles of the 1,993 mile border. Drone carrying drugs crashes south of U.S. border . Maj. Gen. Randolph Alles, assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, runs the program, and hey says while the program needs improvements, it's a mistake to only view the drones' success in terms of arrests. He says the drones give them a big picture of the border, what he calls ""domain awareness."" ""We could never see the border in the same way we could before we got these ..."" adding the information received by the drones is invaluable to agents on the ground. Alles also says in 2013, the arrests by drone brought in $66,000 per hour of contraband seizures. Inspector General John Roth says while the drones do contribute to overall border security, Customs hasn't ""put any measurements in place as to whether it's effective; the measurements we saw show that in fact it's not effective."" Alles says he doesn't want any more drones until he can prove the program works at every level.  Then, perhaps, he will be comfortable with acquiring more of them.  But there are longterm plans circulating from Republican and Democratic supporters of the drones to buy more and have them constantly in the air.","Border Patrol uses drones to scan desert for illegal immigrants .

"(CNN)Dana King's career used to take her to far-flung places like Rwanda, Kosovo and Afghanistan, where she would report on the latest news as part of her job as a TV journalist. These days however, the Emmy-Award winning reporter spends her time painting watercolors and crafting sculptures in her studio in the Bay Area of San Francisco. After a fruitful career in journalism spanning decades, which saw the 54-year-old anchor CBS Morning News and ABC's ""Good Morning America Sunday"" King decided to go back to her original love -- art. ""I've always been an artist, it's always been a part of me, even as a journalist. It's the way I see things visually, it's the way I interpret information,"" she says. King's art explores the human form, with her colorful clay sculptures examining the intricate musculature of both male and female shapes. She also produces charcoal drawings and oil paintings, and has created a public sculpture which for a time graced the corner of San Francisco's Union Square. King sees parallels between her former career and her art: ""I still tell stories. But I tell stories with sculptures and I tell stories with paintings. ""The difference is that a painting or a sculpture will last as long as the material lasts. A television story -- it's a minute, a minute and a half, two and a half if you're really lucky, and if you didn't see it when it aired, it's gone,"" she says. Her early work was heavily influenced by the strife and suffering she saw traveling the world as a journalist, and served as an emotional outlet for her to overcome the negative news that surrounded her in her professional life. ""You have to find a way to tell those stories and survive them emotionally,"" she says, ""but I don't have those stories in front of me anymore. Now I can do whatever, I don't need to do the dark and often ugly as a way of staying okay,"" she says. After a lifetime spent in the deadline-driven, fast-paced world of journalism, King says she relishes the time and space afforded to her by her art: ""I like that feeling of not feeling rushed, of not feeling like I have to be in control of the process at all... and I'm just really along for the ride.

"(CNN)The economy's in the tank, the currency's crumbling, and he's risking diplomatic isolation for doubling down on Ukraine. So how is it that Russian President Vladimir Putin's popularity is at a whopping 86%? That's the conclusion of a poll conducted this month by the Levada Center. Last month, Putin's approval rating was at 85%. The Levada-Center describes itself as an independent, non-governmental polling and sociological research organization. And it has found that Putin's approval ratings have been holding steady in the mid-80s since around May last year, which incidentally is when the Ukraine/Crimea conflict bubbled up. What gives? The answer is simple, says Ben Judah, author of ""Fragile Empire: How Russia Fell In and Out of Love with Vladimir Putin."" ""That figure is made up,"" he told CNN last month. ""An opinion poll can only be conducted in a democracy with a free press,"" he explained. ""In a country with no free press, where people are arrested for expressing their opinions, where the truth is hidden from them, where the media even online is almost all controlled by the government -- when a pollster phones people up and asks, 'Hello, do you approve of Vladimir Putin,' the answer is overwhelmingly yes. ""So what that opinion poll is, is not a poll of approval but it's a poll of fear."" There's another factor at play. Putin has remained defiant in the face of Western sanctions and political pressure to stand down in Ukraine. And that defiance is earning him political points at home despite the impact on the Russian economy. Henry Hale, an international affairs professor at The George Washington University specializing in Russian politics, said on the whole, the polls reflect the reality on the ground of popular support for Putin. ""I don't think Russians are really hiding their feelings,"" Hale told CNN in December, adding that the polls indicate support for Putin, but not necessarily the depth of that support. Media propaganda plays a key role in bolstering Putin's popularity, Hale said, especially in the portrayal of Ukraine's popular revolt as a fascist takeover and in portraying the annexation of Crimea as, essentially, a rescue mission. Nationalism's OK, but families have mouths to feed. And if Russia's economic problems get worse, that could bode ill for Putin. ""Even if he can keep strong popular support, Putin has to worry most of all about keeping happy the oligarchs, the wealthy Russians who back him in exchange for continued prosperity,"" says Frida Ghitis, a world affairs columnist for the Miami Herald, in a piece for CNN.com. ""Economic sanctions and a shrinking economy will not make them happy."" This report incorporates information previously published in a piece by CNN's Jeremy Diamond in December.

"(CNN)The Centers for Disease Control is raising a red flag that a potentially deadly bacteria may be lurking in your doctor's office. The bacteria, C. difficile, is typically found in hospitals, but a study out Wednesday reports a substantial number of people contracted the bug who hadn't been in a hospital, but had recently visited the doctor or dentist. The bacteria can cause deadly diarrhea, according to the CDC, with infections on the rise. The new report shows nearly half a million Americans infected in various locations in one year, with 15,000 deaths directly attributed to C. diff. In a 2013 study, researchers found C. diff present in six out of seven outpatient clinics tested in Ohio, including on patients' chairs and examining tables. The CDC is so concerned that they're starting a new study to try to assess nationally whether people are getting C. diff in doctors' offices. ""This is really an important issue. We need to understand better how people are getting C. diff,"" said Dr. Cliff McDonald, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. In the meantime, patients should wash their hands after visiting the doctor's office -- with soap and water, because alcohol-based gels don't get rid of C.diff. Another tip: Question your doctor whenever you're prescribed an antibiotic. Powerful broad-spectrum antibiotics wipe away good bacteria in your gut that fight off the bad bacteria, which leads the way to C. diff. Johns Hopkins safety expert Dr. Peter Pronovost recommends asking your doctor if you really need an antibiotic, if there's a less powerful one that will treat your infection, and if you're being prescribed the antibiotic for the shortest time possible. The CDC study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, said 150,000 people who had not been in the hospital came down with C. diff in 2011. Of those, 82% had visited a doctor's or dentist's office in the 12 weeks before their diagnosis. The CDC is hoping its new study will help determine cause and effect, because it's possible the patients had C. diff to begin with and went to the doctor to get help. It's also possible that antibiotics prescribed during the doctor's visit, and not microbes at the doctor's office, caused the infection. CNN's Sandee LaMotte contributed to this report .","C. difficile, is typically found in hospitals, but a study finds link to doctor, dentist visits .

"(CNN)The Africa Cup of Nations kicked off in style Saturday despite a build up hampered by Ebola fears and an enforced relocation. It was almost a million dollar start for new hosts Equatorial Guinea -- almost but not quite. The squad had shared a seven-figure bonus after winning their first game of the tournament three years ago, but Congo Brazzaville put paid to any hopes of a windfall this time around. A late equalizer from Thievy Bifouma canceled out captain Emilio Nsue Lopez's opening goal for the hosts. Bifouma, who plays his club football in Spain with UD Almeria, put the ball through goalkeeper Felipe Ovono's legs in the 87th minute to earn Congo a share of the points. The Group A match was played in front of a sell-out crowd of 35,000 fans, which included Equatorial Guinea president Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. In the group's later game, Burkina Faso were defeated 2-0 by Gabon. The exciting curtain raiser was just the tonic for the 30th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which is being staged against a backdrop of off-field controversy. In November, Morocco pulled out as hosts citing fears about the spread of the Ebola epidemic. Many footballers, who are representing their countries at AFCON, are determined to put on a united show of solidarity in the fight against the deadly illness. The Confederation of African Football banned Morocco from the entering the prestigious event and turned to Equatorial Guinea. The tiny, oil rich nation in Central Africa co-hosted AFCON in 2012 with Gabon, which meant it had the facilities in place to handle its short notice call up. But choosing Equatorial Guinea as host for one of the world's most important football tournaments was not without its problems. ""For CAF to give the tournament to Equatorial Guinea was a controversial decision,"" former professional footballer Lutz Pfannenstiel told CNN. ""Western officials cite Equatorial Guinea as an example of a resource rich country that is plagued by kleptocracy problems."" Equatorial Guinea, a country of just 780,000 inhabitants, is known for its extremes of wealth and poverty. It may be the third largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa and have a GDP to rival many a western nation but more than three-quarters of Equatoguineans live in poverty, says the World Bank. Human rights groups also describe the nation as ""one of the world's most repressive societies."" For the 16 teams competing for the AFCON crown, it is hoped the old adage ""football is the real winner"" will once again ring true at the end of the three week competition.","The 30th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations kicks off .

"Hong Kong (CNN)There are no more tents on the streets in Admiralty and Mong Kok and, in some ways, everything is back to normal. I have returned to my daily routine -- I go to school, attend lectures and work part time in a small tutorial center. My family is more than glad to see me resume my normal life. They don't have to worry about receiving calls in the middle of the night informing them that their daughter has been arrested because she broke into a government building. My parents and my sister were really supportive when I was out there protesting. They never forced me to leave the streets. However, my parents took away my passport when I was invited to testify before the British parliament. They told me this was way too political. Attending lectures again actually feels really good. I skipped most of my classes last semester as I used up all my energy during the nights protesting in Mong Kok or in Admiralty and, of course, my results were poor. Getting back to school is also a relief because I no longer have to worry about being hit by a police baton or being sprayed with pepper spray or tear gas. And now I don't have to sleep on a solid concrete floor, I can finally get some rest at night. Like other protest leaders, I've faced some harassment since we left the streets. My Facebook account has been hacked. I'm also too terrified to travel across the border to mainland China. One of my friends, another protester, was detained for more than four hours when she tried to travel there. Luckily, she was only questioned and then sent back to Hong Kong but I don't have the courage to go back. But I'm not giving up on striving for freedom and democracy here. I will continue to devote my time in Keyboard Frontline to defend internet freedom in Hong Kong. We want the government to abandon the implementation of the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF), which allows internet users to delete search results about themselves on search engines if the information is outdated or inadequate, as it will undoubtedly hinder the free flow of information. It's particularly important because Hong Kong has no archives law so there's little transparency. And to prolong the spirit of ""Umbrella Revolution,"" we are supporting a new political group formed online -- Youngspiration. It will field candidates in the coming district council election. We will do whatever we can to strive for freedom on the Internet as we believe the Internet plays an important role in spreading news and information. I hope Hong Kong can become a better place for us Hong Kongers to live. Perhaps I'm not the one most qualified to change the situation here, but I will not hesitate to try, because this is my hometown and I am bound by duty to protect it. Facing the Chinese government, a dictatorship that will not hesitate to hurt its own people, is really frightening. I feel helpless sometimes but I know I am not alone. I have my friends and my partners with me to fight for freedom and democracy here. With all of us making every effort to defend our rights, I know things will change eventually.

"A grand jury has indicted Officer Randall Kerrick of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department on a charge of voluntary manslaughter in the September 14 shooting death of Jonathan Ferrell, according to a statement from state Attorney General Roy Cooper. The grand jury heard evidence from the state Bureau of Investigation and the police department. ""With the strength of the evidence in this case, we're not surprised,"" Charles Monnett, an attorney for Ferrell's family, said about Monday's indictment. ""We're all pleased and happy that the process is beginning now and that there's an end in sight,"" he said. ""It is the first step towards justice."" Ferrell's mother, Georgia, told CNN that she is prepared to wait as long as it takes for the case to wind its way through the justice system. ""I just feel like God's will will be done,"" she said. The Charlotte, North Carolina, officer faced a second grand jury proceeding for the fatal shooting of Ferrell, an ex-college football player who was reportedly seeking assistance after a car accident. Attorneys for Kerrick had denounced the prosecution's move to resubmit the case as unlawful and filed a motion to block it, but CNN affiliate News 14 Carolina reported the grand jury convened Monday morning. A grand jury last week declined to indict Kerrick. Prosecutors said afterward the grand jury was composed of less than a full panel and vowed to send the case back. According to a handwritten statement filed with the court, the first grand jury requested that the prosecutor submit a ""bill of indictment to a lesser-included or related offense,"" but the state attorney general said he would resubmit the voluntary manslaughter charge. Chris Chestnut, another attorney for Ferrell's family, described relatives as ""shocked and devastated"" by the first grand jury's ruling and said they were concerned a ""miscarriage of justice is imminent."" Kerrick's attorneys, however, filed a motion Friday saying that any miscarriage was on the prosecution's part. North Carolina law states that a grand jury can be made up of 12 to 18 members, the defense attorneys said. Thus, the prosecution's claim that it could go back to the grand jury because fewer than 18 members initially heard Kerrick's case was spurious, the motion said. There was ""nothing irregular or improper"" about the grand jury that heard last week's case, the attorneys said in a statement. The motion further alleged that Cooper's statement to the media -- that ""This is not over"" -- and his announcement that he would resubmit the case was a ""wholly improper and blatant attempt to influence the (second) grand jury."" The defense reiterated its claim that the shooting, ""while tragic, was justified under the circumstances presented to Officer Kerrick at the time,"" according to its statement. ""We have seen news clips and interviews stating the community should be 'outraged' at the return of a No True Bill of Indictment,"" the statement continued. ""Those outraged have simply not heard all of the facts and hasten to a position. The true outrage of this community should be at the Attorney General's complete disregard of the original findings of our first grand jury."" Ferrell's family disagreed and issued a statement saying, ""It appears that this motion was filed solely because Randall Kerrick's attorneys feel their client will be indicted once the full Grand Jury properly considers the evidence in this case when it convenes on Monday."" Attorneys for Ferrell's family on January 13 filed a civil lawsuit connected to his death. It targets the city of Charlotte, Mecklenburg County, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe and Kerrick. Kerrick shot an unarmed Ferrell, a 24-year-old ex-Florida A&M football player, after a woman -- home alone with her 1-year-old child -- called 911 and reported someone was trying to break down her front door. It was 2:35 a.m., and according to the lawsuit, the woman ""does not understand that Jonathon may be injured and is in need of assistance and becomes frightened by his presence on her doorstep at such a late hour. She quickly closes the door, calls 911 for assistance and activates her home security system."" The woman told police Ferrell was ""yelling for her to turn her alarm off"" but never reported that Ferrell harmed her, made threatening statements, brandished a weapon or stole or vandalized her property, the lawsuit further alleges. Police were dispatched, and Ferrell walked down the street to seek assistance elsewhere, according to the lawsuit. Kerrick and two other officers arrived on the scene about 11 minutes after the 911 call, but Kerrick didn't speak with the woman, the lawsuit says. He instead tracked down Ferrell, who ""never engages in any conduct which can be objectively reasonably interpreted as aggravated active aggression,"" according to the lawsuit. ""Defendant Kerrick, in direct violation of written police department regulations, fires 12 high-velocity bullets at Jonathon, striking him 10 times in the chest and arms,"" the lawsuit continues. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has called the shooting unlawful. ""The evidence revealed that Mr. Ferrell did advance on Officer Kerrick and the investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr. Ferrell was excessive,"" police said in a statement on September 14, the day of the shooting. ""Our investigation has shown that Officer Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter."" Kerrick is free on $50,000 bond. His attorneys said in their statement Friday, ""The citizens of Mecklenburg County by and through its grand jury have spoken. We pray that if this case is reheard by a second Grand Jury, the same conclusion will be reached -- that there is no probable cause to sustain an indictment for voluntary manslaughter against Officer Kerrick.""

"(CNN)Police in Denmark said Friday they have arrested another suspect in connection with shootings earlier this month in Copenhagen in which two people died. A spokesman for Copenhagen Police said the young man had been arrested Friday morning local time. He is due to appear before a court on Saturday charged with assisting the suspect of the shootings in Copenhagen on February 14-15. His name has not been released. The suspected gunman in the attacks has been named as Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, according to a senior member of the Danish government. The gunman opened fire at a free speech forum in Copenhagen on February 14 before shooting several people outside a synagogue and then firing at police. Police killed him in a shootout outside an apartment complex early on February 15. Two men, ages 19 and 22, were charged with two counts of accessory to murder and five counts of accessory to attempted murder within hours of the gunman's death. The men's attorney said they had pleaded not guilty. The two victims in the shootings have been named as film director Finn Noergaard, 55, and 37-year-old Dan Uzan. CNN's Damien Ward contributed to this report.","Police arrest a man on suspicion of aiding the gunman in the Copenhagen shootings .

"(CNN)We will not know for some time exactly why three men who were arrested on Wednesday in the United States wanted to join ISIS in Syria. But what we do know is that it has become common, even routine, to argue that there exists a process by which potential terrorists become ""radicalized."" The concept, which has become something of a buzzword, suggests that the central motivation for terrorist violence is ideological. However, Islamist terrorists in the West have generally been set off not so much by anything theoretical but rather by intense outrage at American and Israeli actions in the Middle East and by a burning desire to seek revenge, to get back, to defend, and/or to make a violent statement expressing their hostility to what they see as a war on Islam. This can be seen in the story of one of the shooters in the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris. If he was ""radicalized"" by anything, it was by news about the way prisoners were being treated by the United States at Abu Ghraib in Iraq. He spent years trying to get to Iraq to fight the Americans there, finally finding a target closer to home. The same observation arises when one looks over a collection of case studies of terrorists or would-be terrorists who have sought to do damage in the United States. The overwhelming driving force in these cases has been simmering, and more commonly boiling, outrage at American foreign policy. It was not that the plotters in these cases were motivated solely by a coherent ideology or had a burning urge to spread Islam and Sharia law or to establish caliphates. Rather, it was the desire to protect their religion against what they perceived to be a concentrated war upon it in the Middle East by the United States government and military. At the same time, these cases -- from the shoe-bomber to the underwear bomber -- show that there is remarkably little hostility to American culture or society. For example, the infamous Times Square bomber, a Pakistani-American who tried to blow up a car in New York, specifically mentioned U.S. drone strikes that killed civilians in Pakistan. The Boston Marathon bombers, similarly, explicitly cited the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as motivating factors. Almost none of the terrorists or would be terrorists had any problem with American society itself. This is particularly impressive because many of them (though certainly not all) were misfits, suffered from personal identity crises, were friendless, came from broken homes, were often desperate for money, had difficulty holding jobs, were on drugs, were petty criminals, experienced various forms of discrimination, and were, to use a word that pops up in quite a few of the case studies and fits even more of them, ""losers."" As terrorism specialist and former CIA officer Marc Sageman points out, ""radicalization"" principally happens because of perceived injustice against one's group -- a perspective the Washington Post's David Ignatius finds ""worth a careful look,"" but calls ""contrarian."" The standard ""radicalization"" misdirection process can be seen in a Seattle case in 2011 in which two men were picked up for planning to shoot a machine gun and lob grenades at a local military processing center. According to news reports, the perpetrators said that they were motivated by a desire to retaliate for crimes by U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan and that they wanted to kill military personnel to prevent them from going to Islamic lands to kill Muslims. The official Department of Justice press release on the case, however, merely says that the men were ""driven by a violent, extreme ideology."" Similarly a former FBI counterterrorism analyst was asked recently on PBS NewsHour about why people are drawn to violent extremism. He stressed that there are ""ideological issues"" as well as ""local grievances"" including ""access to education and job opportunities"" and whether one feels that one is fully accepted in society. Outrage at American actions in the Middle East scarcely entered the discussion. Speakers at the recent White House summit on countering violent extremism typically found some of the ""root causes"" of terrorism to lie in ideology, the ministrations of propagandists, the influence of the Internet, poverty, inadequate job opportunities and alienation from society. Those may well be contributing factors, but perhaps the most prominent motivating force is anger at U.S. foreign policy.","John Mueller: It's assumed that the central motivation for terrorist violence is ideological .

"(CNN)Their arrests took place in New York and Florida. Abror Habibov, Akhror Saidakhmetov and Abdurasul Juraboev are accused by the federal government of attempting to join ISIS and of fostering plans to kill the President and shoot law enforcement officers. The three men face charges that include attempting and conspiring to provide material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organization, a criminal complaint filed in federal court said. They all legally came to the United States, although one overstayed his welcome. The names: Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West . Here's what we know about them as the case unfolds. Habibov is a 30-year-old Uzbekistani citizen, who police say ""helped organize and finance"" the operation. He was arrested in Jacksonville, Florida. Court documents say Habibov operates mall kiosks that sell kitchenware and repair mobile phones. He has locations in Florida, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Habibov was in the United States legally, but overstayed his visa, according to police. Habibov attended New York City College of Technology in the spring of 2013 as a part-time student, but he is not currently enrolled, according to a statement from the college. Saidakhmetov is a 19-year-old citizen of Kazakhstan and is a legal permanent resident of the United States who lives in Brooklyn, with fellow suspect  Abdurasul Juraboev. Court documents say Saidakhmetov worked at Habibov's mall kiosks in Philadelphia; Savannah, Georgia; and Chesapeake, Virginia, in the fall and winter of 2014. Saidakhmetov was arrested Wednesday at John F. Kennedy International Airport while attempting to catch a flight to Turkey, authorities said. The Brooklyn travel agent who booked his ticket said Saidakhmetov came into the agency where he works last week, wanting to book a round-trip ticket to Istanbul. Saidakhmetov said he couldn't afford a direct flight, which would have cost $900, so the travel agent booked him a trip connecting in Kiev, Ukraine, for $571. At the time, the travel agent said, he saw ""nothing out of the ordinary."" Saidakhmetov purchased the tickets using a New York state ID, the travel agent said. The landlord of the Brooklyn apartment building where Saidakhmetov and Juraboev lived said the 19-year-old recently told him he was about to take a long vacation. Court documents say Saidakhmetov once posted some comments on video of ISIS executing Iraqi forces. ""Allahu akbar (God is great).  I was very happy after reading this, my eyes joyful so much victory."" The criminal complaint says he told a confidential informant that he wanted to travel to Syria to wage jihad, ""but that his mother had feared that he would do so and took his passport so that he could not travel."" Last week, Saidakhmetov called his mother and asked for his passport, according to the criminal complaint. ""When asked where he wanted to go, Saidakhmetov responded that, if a person has a chance to join Islamic State and does not go there, on judgment day he will be asked why, and that it is a sin to live in the land of infidels,"" the complaint says. ""After Saidakhmetov continued to ask for his passport, his mother hung up the phone."" Saidakhmetov told the informant he would try to get his passport back by telling his mom he was traveling to Uzbekistan to visit relatives. When the informant suggested it might be better to take a direct flight to Turkey, Saidakhmetov responded, ""America is catching, they are very strict now. ... it is better to fool them by flying here and flying there."" There were other recorded conversations . In one from November, Saidakhmetov told Juraboev that he wanted to join the U.S. military so he could share information with ISIS. At the very least, he said, ""he could always open fire on American soldiers and kill as many of them as possible,"" according to the complaint. In another recorded conversation in January, Saidakhmetov told the informant that if he couldn't get travel documents to go to Syria, ""I will just go and buy a machine gun, AK-47, go out and shoot all police."" Later, according to the complaint, he said, ""It is legal in America to carry a gun. We will go and purchase one handgun ... then go and shoot one police officer. Boom. ... Then, we will take his gun, bullets and bulletproof vest ... then, we will do the same with a couple of others. Then we will go to the FBI headquarters, kill the FBI people."" Juraboev is a 24-year-old citizen of Uzbekistan. Like Saidakhmetov, he is a legal permanent resident of the United States. Court documents say he's also known as Abdulloh ibn Hasan. Before his arrest at his Brooklyn home, Juraboev was scheduled to hop a flight to Turkey, the criminal complaint said. He worked at the Gyro King restaurant in Brooklyn and had asked for the weekend off so he could travel. He would arrive at work around noon daily, wearing headphones and greeting co-workers as he made his delivery of lettuce, tomatoes and onions, according to a co-worker named Saad, who described the suspect as quiet and ""just a normal guy."" Zak Kahn, owner of Gyro King, said Juraboev was quiet and not given to discussing politics. ""I never heard him -- not even a single sentence -- (talk) about politics, about jihad, about army, about military or force... What happened to him? He seemed to be a very peaceful person."" Kahn said Juraboev told him about a month ago that he was returning to the homeland. ""He became even more alone,"" he told CNN on Thursday, adding that Juraboev seemed more detached and wore his headphones most of the time. On February 21, Juraboev sent his employer a text message: ""Brother I want to leave my country next weekend. Because I have some problem. Is it possible or not? Sorry!"" In August, court documents say, Juraboev was active on an Uzbek-language website that promoted ISIS. ""Greetings! We too wanted to pledge our allegiance and commit ourselves while not present there,"" Juraboev is said to have posted. ""I am in USA now but we don't have any arms. But is it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway while here? What I'm saying is, to shoot Obama and then get shot ourselves, will it do? That will strike fear in the hearts of infidels."" The post earned Juraboev a visit from federal agents several days later. Juraboev admitted that he'd posted the message and that he believed in the ISIS agenda. He also said ""that he would harm Obama if he had the opportunity to do so, but currently does not have the means or an imminent plan to do so,"" the complaint says. In intercepted online communication to a pro-ISIS website, Juraboev said his parents were in Uzbekistan. ""Sometimes they worship and practice Islam, sometimes they do idolatry,"" he said, according to the complaint. ""My sisters are uncovered, lack knowledge of a religion. I wish they knew at least how to cover themselves up."" The administrator encouraged him to join the fight.  Juraboev said he's worried about being caught, the court documents say. CNN's Will Ripley, David Shortell, Julia Talanova, Jason Caroll and Yon Pomrenze contributed to this report.","All three men came to the United States legally .

"London (CNN)Mohammed Emwazi: The world knows him better as ""Jihadi John,"" the man whose masked face and British accented-taunts have featured in a series of brutal ISIS execution videos. But many of those who grew up with him have told the UK media that remember Emwazi altogether differently: as the typical ""boy next door,"" a popular kid who loved football, pop music and The Simpsons. A day after the long-standing mystery behind Jihadi John's identity was solved, clues to his past have begun to emerge -- but far from showing him as a violent extremist, they paint a picture of an ordinary child and teenager growing up in the British capital. Emwazi was born in Kuwait in 1988, and moved to the UK with his parents, Jasem and Ghaneya, and sister at the age of six, according to CAGE, an advocacy group for those affected by terrorism investigations. The family settled down in west London; Emwazi's father is reported to have worked as a taxi driver, while his mother stayed at home to look after Emwazi and his siblings. He is reported to have attended St Mary Magdalene Church of England Primary School, in London's Maida Vale; a photograph published on the front pages of several British newspapers showed a smiling young boy in the school's scarlet sweater uniform, surrounded by his classmates and teacher -- a far cry from the black-clad jihadi infamous around the world. When contacted by CNN, the school's headteacher refused to comment. On its website, the school -- whose motto is ""believe, achieve and succeed together"" -- proudly proclaims: ""We are a very inclusive, multicultural and diverse school, where many languages and religions reside happily under one roof."" A former classmate there told the Daily Mail newspaper that Emwazi was sporty and popular, but had initially struggled with English: ""He could only say a few words at first, like his name and where he was from. ""He played football every lunchtime and at the after-school football club. Through football, he learned different words and expressions."" The paper reported that, writing in a class yearbook aged 10, Emwazi told of his love for pop group S Club 7, The Simpsons, the shoot-'em-up computer game Duke Nukem and -- like so many other British children -- listed his favourite food as chips. Another friend from St Mary Magdalene told radio station LBC: ""I used to go with him to that primary school ... I do remember him very well ... I was a year younger than him and he treated me as someone he used to teach."" The man, who was identified only as Mohammed, said the pair's mothers had been ""very good friends"" until three years ago when rumors began to circulate about Emwazi's terror links. ""His mum used to sell gold and stuff like that to the local community."" Mohammed and another former classmate both said they have vivid memories of a painful injury sustained by the youngster when he was in the final year of primary school. ""In the playground ... He was just about to get into a fight and he was running away from someone ... another guy tried to block off his path. He had nowhere to go and he basically ran into the goalposts, hit his head onto a metal goalpost and fell to the floor,"" Mohammed told LBC, adding that his friend missed two weeks of classes and ""he was not the same, ever since that brain injury."" Londoner Matt Seton wrote on Twitter that he went to school with Emwazi: ""He was a 12 year old kid ... I remember one [time] we were playing football and he smashed his head on the goalpost. Now he kills people for a living."" After leaving St Mary Magdalene, Emwazi is believed to have moved on to the Quintin Kynaston Academy in neighboring St. John's Wood, whose alumni include singers Tulisa Contostavolos and Shola Ama; his sister later became a prefect there. One of his classmates -- speaking on condition of anonymity -- told the Daily Telegraph newspaper he was a ""typical north-west London boy."" ""He seemed like a nice guy ... a down-to-earth person and humble. He liked football and he was friends with everyone. All the Indian boys, all the Pakistani boys, people from different religions, he spoke to everyone."" A neighbor of the Emwazi family told CNN he was a ""polite young man."" A former teacher told Britain's Channel 4 News that Emwazi was ""a diligent hardworking lovely young man. Responsible, polite, quiet. He was everything that you'd want a student to be. ""He was somebody who would always seek the correct way of handling something. He did things in the right way,"" she insisted. ""There was never any indication of any violence at all."" The unidentified educator said her ex-pupil ""was religious ... and I think as he got older he did become more devout. He would go to the mosque on Fridays and pray but a lot of our kids did that."" Emwazi apparently did well enough at the school to go on to Westminster University in London; he completed a degree in 2009. Asim Qureshi, research director of CAGE, insists that the Mohammed Emwazi he knew was ""very kind, extremely gentle, [a] humble individual, who didn't have any self-importance about himself."" Intelligence services and terrorism experts are now piecing together just how he went from that to the infamous ""bogeyman"" of ISIS -- something which continues to puzzle many of those who knew him as a boy.

"(CNN)The shipper said it was a $37 piece of art craft being sent to the United States as a Christmas present. The feds say it was actually a stolen Picasso, missing for more than a decade and worth millions of dollars. The work of art, painted in 1911 by the Cubist master, was recovered when it was shipped from Belgium to the United States in December. It was discovered by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol and seized by Homeland Security Investigations. ""A lost treasure has been found,"" said Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Lynch filed civil action to gain possession of the painting. It will be returned to the French government, which owns the painting. The work, entitled ""La Coiffeuse"" (""The Hairdresser""), was discovered missing in 2001.

"Boston (CNN)The death penalty trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- long delayed by painstaking jury selection, crippling snowstorms and last-ditch appeals to move the case someplace else -- is on track to get underway here next week. Judge George O'Toole, along with the prosecution and defense teams, settled on a pool of 70 jury prospects on Wednesday after questioning 256 people over 21 days of individual interviews. The attorneys will weed out jurors they believe are less sympathetic to their case on Tuesday, March 3. These ""preemptory challenges"" let attorneys remove jury prospects without giving a reason. Each side gets 20 challenges for the main jury and three for the alternates. The following morning, the panel of 12 jurors and six alternates is expected to be formally seated to hear opening statements and the first witnesses to an event that cut Boston to its core. O'Toole indicated the trial could last well into June. The jurors first will decide whether Tsarnaev is guilty of using weapons of mass destruction to kill people at a large public event. If convicted, the jury then will decide whether he should be punished by life in prison without the possibility of release or death, most likely by lethal injection. Potential jurors were questioned at length about whether they already believed Tsarnaev was guilty and whether they could consider the death penalty in a state where it hasn't been an option in a generation. The last execution here took place in 1947. Many said they thought Tsarnaev was guilty of the April 15, 2013, bombings, which killed three people near the finish line. Tsarnaev also is charged in the April 19, 2013, death of MIT police officer Sean Collier. The officer was ambushed in his patrol car and shot to death as Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan ran from police hours after their photographs were released to the public. The defense, claiming it couldn't find an impartial jury in Boston, tried three times to persuade O'Toole to move the trial. He refused. An appeal is pending before the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which has not ruled. Opening statements and the first witnesses originally were slated for January 26, but it took longer that anticipated to question the prospective jurors for this high-profile case. The panel of 70 was selected from the first 600 or so jurors of the 1,373 who filled out questionnaires earlier this year. Many of the jury prospects struggled with questions about where they stood on the death penalty and whether they could follow the law and vote for capital punishment if the facts and the law led them to that decision. Massachusetts wiped the death penalty from its books for good in 1984. But this case is being tried in federal court, and 17 of the 30 counts against Tsarnaev include the death penalty as a possible punishment. Also cited are so-called aggravating factors such as committing an act of terror and the tender years of the youngest victim, 8-year-old Martin Richard. It is almost certain that the trial, which will include wrenching testimony and video footage of the bombing victims, will be well underway during the running of this year's Boston Marathon on April 20. Tsarnaev, 21, is accused of building two homemade pressure cooker bombs with his older brother, Tamerlan. The bombs detonated within moments of each other near the finish line. Beside the three deaths, more than 250 other people were maimed or injured by flying shrapnel and nails. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died during a gun battle with police, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hours later, bleeding and hiding in a boat in a Watertown backyard. He had written Islamic slogans on the sides of the boat, federal authorities allege. No cameras are allowed at the Tsarnaev trial. But CNN's Ann O'Neill will be there every day.

"(CNN)A small Missouri town's discovery that a gunmant killed seven people and injured another Thursday night began when a girl managed to flee a residence where she heard gunfire. She ran to a neighbor's house and called police, say investigators in Tyrone, Missouri. Authorities then found a trail of death that was so staggering, a state trooper lost count at a news conference. Seven people, all gunshot victims, were found dead in four residences in the small town of 50 people. One person managed to survive, and she was found wounded in one of the homes. The gunman also was found dead Friday morning in a GMC pickup after going to another county more than 15 miles away, where he apparently shot himself. He was identified Friday as Joseph Jesse Aldridge, 36, who was believed to be a cousin to four of the seven slain victims, the Missouri State Highway Patrol said. And, in a twist to their probe, investigators happened upon another body -- that of an elderly woman -- in a fifth home, though she died of natural causes. That person was the gunman's mother, Alice L. Aldridge, 74. She died of metastatic lung cancer, said Tom Whittaker, the coroner for Texas County, Missouri. It was unclear Friday whether her death was connected to the case, Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Jeff Kinder said. The gunman's finding his mother dead could be a motive, ""but it would speculation for us to say that is the case,"" Kinder told CNN. ""We're examining of a lot of different avenues now."" The gunman ""had been (living) with her for quite some time,"" said Texas County Sheriff James Sigman. The shooter didn't leave a note, so investigators are asking family and neighbors about a possible motive, the sheriff said. In all, nine of the town's approximate 50 residents were found dead or killed overnight, nearly decimating the town twice over, according to authorities. There were a total of six police scenes: Three had two bodies each. Two had one body each. And then there was the site where the suspect apparently committed suicide. ""Everybody is in disbelief now,"" Kinder said. ""They're shocked. They will all just have to take care of each other. But it has just shocked this community to its core, and we will just have to work our way through it."" Among the seven slain gunshot victims were two married couples, who were described as cousins of the gunman, authorities said. They were Garold Dee Aldridge, 52, and wife Julie Ann Aldridge, 47, and Harold Wayne Aldridge, 50, and wife Janell Arlisa Aldridge, 48. All victims lived within a three-mile radius of each other, authorities said. The other three victims weren't identified pending notification of their relatives. They weren't from the same family, the sheriff said. Everyone surely knew each other, the sheriff said. ""It is a small community out there. Everybody knows everybody, but as far as what their personal relationship is ... I couldn't tell you,"" the sheriff said. ""Crime like this in any community is pretty major."" Investigators spoke to the surviving victim, a woman, but weren't disclosing details, Sigman said. ""We obtained part of our information from her,"" Sheriff Sigman said. ""As far as I know, she's expected to be okay."" Suspect Joseph Jesse Aldridge, who used a .45-caliber handgun, had ""a minor criminal history"" with local authorities, Sigman added. In summarizing the crime, Kinder momentarily lost track of the death toll at a news conference. ""There are ... isn't that terrible? Lose count. There is actually nine total victims here in this case,"" he told reporters. The carnage was overwhelming, he added. ""In our job, we see a lot of bad stuff, and this is bad,"" Kinder said. ""This is also hard on the police officers who are working out there. It's not natural to see that sort of thing."" The juvenile girl whose police call exposed the mass deaths had been in a residence where two bodies were later found, Kinder said. Authorities also don't yet know the relationship between the girl and those two deceased victims, Kinder said. ""I don't have any information that would confirm any of that other than she was at the residence at the time it started,"" he said. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said the state was ensuring that mental health counselors and crisis intervention services would be provided to students in the area and other residents. ""This is a horrific tragedy, and our hearts go out to the victims of these senseless acts and their families,"" he said. The shootings happened in Texas County, home to about 26,000 people. After police found two bodies in the first residence, investigators found five more bodies and an injured person in three other Tyrone homes, according to Kinder. The elderly woman who's believed to have died of natural causes was found in a fifth residence after ""investigators were somehow led to that residence after this was all placed in motion,"" he said. The suspect's body was found in a vehicle in neighboring Shannon County, Kinder said. Tyrone is about 135 miles (217 kilometers) southwest of St. Louis. It wasn't immediately clear if any of the victims were of school age, but news of the deaths has shaken the community, the superintendent of the area's schools said Friday. ""There is a lot of speculation right now, and we just don't have the information.  The area is within the school district; these are my families,"" said Scott Dill, superintendent of the Houston R-1 School District. ""We run buses out there daily."" Classes for the district's 1,000 students are in session Friday, in part to give them a sense of normalcy, he said. ""We do have counselors available, and other offers from other districts to help out.  As a small town, we all cry together.  My principals are all assessing the situation now, and we will make a determination on what to do next,"" Dill said. CNN's Amanda Watts and Camille Cava contributed to this report.","Coroner says mother off suspect was found dead of lung cancer .
