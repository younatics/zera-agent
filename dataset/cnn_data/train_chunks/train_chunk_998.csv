"Mario Balotelli is the scapegoat for Liverpool’s problems and poor transfer dealings in the summer, according to former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes. The Italian scored a crucial equaliser against Swansea in the Reds' Capital One Cup win on Tuesday but the volley was a first goal in his last nine appearances. Scholes recognises the striker’s performances must improve, especially in the absence of Daniel Sturridge, but insists Liverpool’s other summer acquisitions haven’t fitted the bill and Balotelli can only be partly to blame. Mario Balotelli (centre) came on as a substitute to score against Swansea in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday . ‘Another week of Mario Balotelli stories and I cannot help thinking he is an easy target. There are some players at Liverpool getting away with murder while Balotelli cops a lot of the stick,’ Scholes told the Independent. ‘His name, his reputation, even his body language on the pitch, they all add up to the kind of player who attracts criticism.' Scholes sees the expected return of Daniel Sturridge in mid-November, who hasn’t played for Liverpool since August, as key to Balotelli’s revival. Balotelli enjoys his goal on Tuesday with Jordan Henderson and eventual match-winner Dejan Lovren (right) Never far from controversy, the Italian was also embroiled in a spat with former Liverpool player Jonjo Shelvey . ‘Sturridge is a top-quality player who can take defenders on and score. I also think he will make Balotelli look a better player. ‘I don’t think Balotelli scores highly when it comes to the basics you look for in a striker – movement, finishing, work rate – but his form, the goal against Swansea aside, is just part of the problem at Liverpool.' Scholes has criticised Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers for his summer transfers, who like Balotelli have struggled to live up to their price tags at Anfield so far. Balotelli will be helped by the return of Daniel Sturridge (centre right), which is expected in mid-November . ‘Balotelli has taken the spotlight off some of the other summer signings. Dejan Lovren has struggled. Lazar Markovic has not scored and he cost £20m. 'Alberto Moreno is quick but is yet to convince as a defender. Adam Lallana is the only one who looks like he is comfortable with the shift, and at £25m he was overpriced.' ‘I recognise Brendan Rodgers needed a bigger squad, but they should have gone for fewer players and greater quality. Balotelli cannot take the blame for all of that.’ Scholes believes Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers' (right) summer signings were not at the right level of quality .

"Alan Pardew never lost the Newcastle dressing room during their miserable run of form earlier in the season, according to former Magpies' favourite Warren Barton. The St. James' Park outfit failed to win their opening seven games of the season in the Premier League as pressure on club owner Mike Ashley to replace Pardew grew with fans protesting against the 53-year-old during matches. Prior to October, Newcastle had only won six of their 28 fixtures this calendar year before their fortunes turned with league victories at home to Leicester and away to Tottenham. Newcastle boss Alan Pardew never lost the dressing room during their bad run, according to Warren Barton . Wednesday's impressive 2-0 Carling Cup fourth round win at holders Manchester City has continued the positive momentum being built at the club - something Barton believes proves that the players were always in support of Pardew even through the bad times. He told TalkSPORT: 'Even in their hardest moments, like Stoke away, when the pressure was really on, there was still that effort and commitment. 'I don't think the players will turn their back on him [Alan Pardew], he took a lot of them there. They believed in what he was trying to do.'

"West Brom’s Jeremy Peace has become the first Premier League chairman to call for a system to be introduced to protect the game’s young millionaire players from frittering away their wages. Football’s ‘too much, too soon’ culture — whereby young stars like Manchester United’s Tyler Blackett can earn £50,000 a week after a handful of games — is causing major concern in football’s higher echelons, because it could demotivate young players, and because they may spend the money unwisely and have nothing left when they need it. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, under pressure to increase 19-year-old Raheem Sterling’s contract from £40,000 a week, has spoken widely about the issue, stating: ‘Young players get carried away and then wonder why their careers fall away. They buy a new Range Rover Sport before they have a driving licence.’ West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace has expressed concern about the effect of multi-million pound contracts on young players in the Premier League . Manchester United defender Tyler Blackett is set to be rewarded with a £50,000-a-week contract after starting regularly for the club during the early stages of the season . Former Crewe manager Dario Gradi, who helped develop the career of dozens of players including David Platt and Danny Murphy, has revealed that the subject kept coming up when he was part of Greg Dyke’s FA commission into the game. Peace is particularly concerned about wages being squandered. He said: ‘My view on young players is that it would be a good thing to try to protect their money in some way. When you read about Tyler Blackett and other young players getting a big jump in wages, the natural reaction is “Wow”. 'You just hope, when any young player is being given all this money, that the agents or friends are advising them to put it away somewhere safe, so if it goes wrong or they have an injury, they have something saved to enjoy when they eventually retire. ‘I just think there should be some mechanism in place so all the money they earn is not spent.’ FA Chairman Greg Dyke revealed the subject of astronomical wages for young players came up during his recent commission into the state of the game . West Brom gave England Under 21 star Saido Berahino the chance to impress at a young age . Peace is at a club that prides itself on developing young players. Albion gave Isaiah Brown a debut at 16 — he has since signed for Chelsea — and currently have England Under 21 striker Saido Berahino on their books. Berahino has already scored six goals this season. The Albion chairman added: ‘I am sure some agents are already very good at looking after their players long term, but I worry about what happens to others. You hear tales. ‘I remember one player here who came with nothing and went out with nothing. He had earned quite a lot of money in the years he was with us and really had nothing to show for it. 'A tragedy really, and the figures for Premier League salaries are getting bigger and bigger. For the man in the street, it is a hell of a lot of money.’ Blackett, 20, has been offered a deal by Manchester United that will take his salary from £2,000 to around £50,000 a week, a pay rise of 2,400 per cent. He has played six Premier League matches. Blackett is currently on £2,000-a-week at Old Trafford but that is about to increase to £50,000 . Although Peace did not go into details about what his ‘mechanism’ should entail, clubs in Holland have experimented with the idea of a trust fund for younger players so they can only access part of their salary when they are older. Gradi said although the trust fund was not among the recommendations of Dyke’s commission, the issue of growing salaries for young players was one he has heard discussed regularly. ‘It’s a difficult one for me to give an opinion on because we never had that issue at Crewe,’ Gradi said. ‘If we offered a promising young player £500-a-week with a £5,000 signing-on fee, their faces would light up.’ Agent Ian Anderson, who was recently involved in the £13million transfer of Dusan Tadic to Southampton, said: ‘All you can do as a friend is encourage them in general. You might suggest that buying a house rather than renting makes more sense, and things like that. ‘There have undoubtedly been players even at the top level who have earned big money and are now bankrupt or having to scratch around for a living.’","Jeremy Peace has called for a system to protect Premier League's young stars from frittering away their million-pound pay packets .

"Alan Pardew was always confident the day would arrive when calls for him to be sacked would quieten - and he has likened Newcastle United’s revival to building IKEA furniture. The United boss - whose wife is Swedish - says that he went back to basics amid a seven-game winless start to the season which saw fans protest against his employment. Pardew, though, has since led the Magpies to three straight victories and will bid to extend that run when they entertain Liverpool in front of the live television cameras at lunchtime on Saturday. Newcastle United celebrate as the Magpies beat Manchester City 2-0 in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday . Magpies boss Alan Pardew has compared the Toon's revival to the time it takes to build IKEA furniture . And the 53-year-old has given an insight into his thinking during the perilous period in which his side were stuck to the bottom of the table. ‘You've got to box it down. It's a bit like one of those IKEA furniture packs you buy,’ he said. ‘You can't try and get to the end, you've got to do all the little bits to get there and it takes time. I've done a few of them because my wife's Swedish. ‘It's about doing that little bit first, and if you get that wrong, the second bit doesn't work. If you get the second bit wrong, the third bit definitely isn’ t working and the tabletop is all over the place. Moussa Sissoko celebrates scoring for Newcastle United during the 2-0 victory at the Etihad on Wednesday . Newcastle boss Alan Pardew believes his side now have serious 'momentum' going into Liverpool clash . ‘I think it's very important, if you're in the managerial world, that you actually segment it down and just say, “Right, what's our problem, what do we need to do, what needs to happen at this football club to turn us from what we are to a better team?”. ‘We did a review of how we were getting at teams and how they were getting at us. That helped us and I think we've put some blocks in place that gives us something to hinge on to.’ It speaks volumes that Pardew is able to offer such light-hearted metaphor, for just four weeks ago there was no scope for levity. A website - SackPardew.com - had attempted to mobilise fans into forcing the manager out of the club. Disgruntled Magpies supporters display 'SackPardew.com' banners against Stoke City back in September . Newcastle manager Alan Pardew congratulates Rolando Aarons after Wednesday's League Cup success . As one supporter on social media joked this week, perhaps they will change the domain name to BackPardew.com in light of the turnaround. Pardew, though, never lost faith in his own ability. ‘As an experienced manager, I’ve had times like that before,’ he said. ‘Not perhaps with the scale of the media criticism that I was receiving, but I’ ve had results like that at Charlton and West Ham, and you have to try to find a solution. Ayoze Perez runs off in celebration after heading in the winner for Newcastle United at Tottenham Hotspur . Perez heads Newcastle into the lead  against Tottenham as the Magpies went on to win 2-1 on Sunday . ‘If you don’t believe you’re strong enough as a character to find a solution, then don’t do the job. I’m confident I can do this job, and I was always confident I could turn it around.’ The 2-0 victory at Manchester City in the League Cup in midweek arrived on the back of wins at home to Leicester City and at Tottenham Hotspur. Another maximum return in Saturday's early kick-off would take them into the top half of the Premier League. And Pardew went on: ‘I’ve always thought the same since I first became a manager - momentum is the key to success in sport. Newcastle players celebrate with Perez after the Spanish striker scored the winner at White Hart Lane . Rolando Aarons scores after seven minutes to set Newcastle on their way to shock win at Manchester City . ‘I give the example of Andy Murray. You can see at the moment that he’s entered tournaments that might not normally be on his agenda, but he wants to win them because there’s a big one coming up at the end of the season and he wants to be in form for it. ‘I think that’s how managers approach every game. You want to build momentum, and we have great momentum at the moment. There’s no way we could have won at Manchester city if we hadn’t won at Spurs. I honestly believe that.’ From Scottish tennis players to Swedish flat-pack furniture, Newcastle’s recent rally has certainly turned the table for their boss.

Real academy prospect Harper was just 17 when Bale joined the club for £86million last summer.

Ronaldo missed one penalty and scored another, moving him to 69 Champions League goals – just two short of Raul’s record – but Wednesday  was not a night for Madrid milestones, more of narrowly avoiding embarrassment. They started slowly, defended badly and former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez almost completed the horror show with an awful second-half miss with the score still at 1-1. He was replaced by Karim Benzema, who scored what was to be Real’s winner. Karim Benzema celebrates scoring the winner for Real Madrid against Ludogorets no more than 10 minutes after coming off the bench . Benzema's slick finish saved Real Madrid from an embarrassing journey home from Sofia . Ludogorets: Stoyanov; Paula Junior, Aleksandrov, Moti, Minev, Aleksandrov, Dyakov, Marcelinho (Cristaldo Farias 70), Gomes Fonseca, Abalo Paulos, Bezjak . Subs not used: Andrianantenaina, Angulo, Zlatinski, Borjan, Misidjan, Younes . Goal: Marcelinho 7 . Booked: Minev, Dyakov, Gomes Fonseca, Abalo Paulos . Real Madrid: Casillas, Arbeloa, Varane, Ramos, Marcelo, Bale, Modric, Illarramendi, Isco, Hernández (Benzema 67), Ronaldo . Subs not used: Pepe, Kroos, Rodríguez, Navas, Carvajal, Nacho . Goals: Ronaldo 24 (pen), Benzema 77 . Booked: Ramos . It was the Bulgarian team’s first home game in the Champions League, and they weren’t even ‘properly’ at home. With UEFA regulations meaning the club could not use its tiny 6,100-capacity Ludogorets Arena, they had had to make the 324km journey to Sofia to play the game in Bulgaria’s national stadium. Around 5,000 of their home town Razgrad’s 33,000 population had made the five-hour road trip to watch their team and they were given a night they will never forget. Madrid were behind inside just six minutes when they failed to defend a corner. Sergio Ramos and Gareth Bale were beaten at the near post and Marcelinho ghosted in at the back post ahead of a static Alvaro Arbeloa to head in the flick on. Real had the chance to equalise almost immediately but Ronaldo failed to convert a penalty. Hernandez went down in the box and the Portugal superstar stepped up with a customary well-struck spot kick but keeper Vladislav Stoyanov guessed right and saved. Ronaldo then had the ball in the net but was incorrectly flagged offside in what was turning into a nightmare first away game for the holders. On 24 minutes Real's No 7 won his second penalty of the night with an exaggerated tumble after contact from Cosmin Moti. He put the penalty the same side and this time, despite Stoyanov going the right way again, the net bulged and Madrid were level. Three minutes before half time Hernandez had the chance to put the visitors ahead but dragged his shot wide from Isco’s pass. The midfielder had been the away side’s best player but there was little competition with Bale and Luka Modric below par and Real missing Toni Kroos, who had been left on the bench.

Bale improved at the start of the second half and could have put Madrid ahead with a header from an Isco cross that Stoyanov did well to save. Madrid’s next chance was not saved but missed, dreadfully, by Hernandez. The former Manchester United striker only had to tap in Isco’s centre after a classic Madrid counter-attack involving a 30-metre sprint from Bale and a pass from Ronaldo, but somehow ‘Chicharito’ spooned his effort away from goal. Ludogorets had chances to take the lead and only a fine save from Iker Casillas prevented Marcelinho from scoring his and the Bulgarians’ second.

Ronaldo points to the number on his back as he chalks up yet another Champions League goal . Ancelotti finally made a change and predictably it was Hernandez who made way for Benzema. The Frenchman immediately set up Ronaldo but his effort was cleared off the line by Yordan Minev. Benzema then saved Madrid’s blushes with the late winner from Marcelo’s cross. The full back made an important clearance to maintain the visitors' advantage moments later and Bale brought a fine save from Stoyanov at the death. Madrid were off the hook and go into their double-header with Liverpool on six points. But this was yet more evidence that the biggest of the big spenders have weaknesses that  Brendan Rodgers’ side will hope to expose.

"Harry Redknapp believes grappling and holding have come into English football due to players and youngsters watching foreign football on television. The Queens Park Rangers manager claims the practice did not take place back when he was a player and that children are taught from a young age to mark correctly from set pieces. Redknapp said: 'No-one grappled in those days, it's a new thing. It was watching foreign football. In Italian football they used to mark like that years ago. It didn't happen in England. QPR manager Harry Redknapp believes watching foreign football on TV has influenced grappling in the game . Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross and Graziano Pelle grapple during the Capital One Cup tie on Wednesday . 'Hopefully people will learn to mark correctly. You can't mark looking at the opponent when the corner's being played in. I've said it for years. 'If someone is taking a corner and I'm a defender and I'm looking at you and not the ball – how can that be the way to mark? All I'm doing is trying to stop you and grab hold of you and stop you heading the ball. 'Maybe people will get their position right, get sideways on, so they can see the ball and the man. That's what you teach kids when they come into football clubs at 11 years of age. 'You don't teach kids to grapple hold of someone, just pull them. That's happening more and more hopefully we will get some decisions that will stop people doing it.' Chelsea's Branislav Ivanovic wrestles with Chris Smalling while on the right, John Terry grapples Marcos Rojo . The QPR bench celebrate after Charlie Austin scored his second goal to beat Aston Villa 2-0 on Monday . According to Redknapp, the problem will never be stamped out until referees start taking stricter action against it. He would have no problem if officials told managers and teams before games that they were going to start handing out yellow cards and awarding penalties if it takes place. Redknapp added: 'It is happening more and more. It's so difficult, how many penalties are you going to give a game? Six? Seven?

"Referees are ready to clampdown on the dark arts highlighted in Sportsmail’s ‘Hands Off In The Box’ campaign. After another weekend blighted by grappling in the penalty area, this newspaper has called for tough action on wrestling, grabbing and shirt pulling. Premier League bosses privately agree that this escalating problem needs to be tackled. Sportsmail has been told the issue will be discussed with Professional Game Match Officials Limited, the body representing the country’s referees. The clampdown is likely to take the same course as the approach to diving and two-footed challenges, with senior referees and their bosses first discussing how best to deal with the problem.

Sportsmail highlighted the issue after recent inconsistency towards blatant foul play at corners and free-kicks. Phil Dowd’s failure to penalise Manchester United players for challenges against Chelsea came a week after Stoke’s Ryan Shawcross was punished with a penalty against Swansea for a similar offence. ‘Because it’s not a change of law this is something the PGMOL can do almost immediately,’ explained former referee Graham Poll. ‘It’s simply a change of emphasis.

Cahill uses his body to get the better of Shrewsbury striker James Collins at Greenhous Meadow . ‘It’s just a case of establishing some consistency with all 16 of them. Do they agree it’s a yellow card, or a penalty or so on? ‘Once that is established they would contact the clubs and inform them that the players will be punished accordingly in future. When it’s as obvious as this you have to take action.’ Chelsea’s Gary Cahill has become the first defender to back our campaign. He said: ‘There’s a difference between touching the player, getting your arm across, and grabbing hold of somebody. The Ryan Shawcross one got punished recently so maybe it’s one the referees are looking at.’ John Terry, Chelsea captain . 'Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.' Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager . 'Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees' interpretation and we'll leave it to them. That's what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it's in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn't have to mark anyone.' Ian Wright, Ex-Arsenal striker . 'There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.' Graham Poll, Former top referee . 'Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.' Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender . 'Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.' Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager . 'In a congested area how can you judge if someone's been blocked? It's part of the game and some people are good at it. It's football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. 'Can you show me some blocking techniques?' That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won't be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.' And the readers of MailOnline... 'It's more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It's about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.' Willdajack, Neath . 'To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop.

Rodgers’ summer gamble has so far looked woefully ill-advised, with Balotelli flopping since joining Liverpool for £16m from AC Milan.

Whether Balotelli is open to learning remains to be seen, with suggestions that the club’s losses could be cut at the end of the season, but Monk admired Rodgers’ man-management at Swansea and expects him to transform the Italian. He said: ‘If anyone is going to do it Brendan can. He’s a very good guy, a very good man manager who is personable and who understands players and different characters. ‘I’d expect him definitely to be the man to do that.’ Monk has thrived in his first season as Swansea’s permanent manager, while his former boss has seen Liverpool struggle following the sale of Luis Suarez and injury to Daniel Sturridge. Monk, who still consults Rodgers on management dilemmas. added: ‘Brendan’s had to bring in some new players having obviously lost a key one. He’s spent the money on a number of players and it’s a transition period. Balotelli posted this picture on Instagram on Monday night accompanied by the caption 'Never lose the faith!' Swansea's Wilfried Bony celebrates scoring his second goal in the 2-0 victory against Leicester on Saturday . ‘Sturridge is a big miss as well because he’s a big player. They’ve stuttered a little bit but they’re still a good team. They’ve still got really good players. You go through periods of form like that in your career as teams but they’re more than good enough to bounce back. ‘It’s a transition after losing such an important player who is so hard to replace. I think Brendan is still finding a way to do that but they’ll bounce back because they have very good players.’ Despite Liverpool’s form, Monk makes them the favourites for Tuesday’s Anfield clash. He said: ‘There’s no reason we can’t win but it’s going to be extremely tough. It’s Anfield, we haven’t got a big as squad as them or as a number of teams in this league.’ Swansea’s Neil Taylor injured his knee in the 2-0 win over Leicester on Saturday, but is expected to play.","Mario Balotelli has flopped since joining Liverpool for £16m from AC Milan .

"Roy Hodgson wants to see some of his England stars line up for the Under-21s in next summer's European Championship. Providing they get through a two-legged play-off against Croatia, Gareth Southgate's Young Lions will take part in the eight-team tournament in the Czech Republic next June. The last time England qualified, an under-strength squad failed to get out of the group stage after losing all three of their games. They did not score once from open play. Roy Hodgson celebrates England's win over Switzerland earlier this month . Stuart Pearce was in charge of the England U21 team at the last European Championships . Jordan Henderson was part of the England U21 team that crashed out of the last European Championships . Lorenzo Insigne (not pictured) scores for Italy against England at the last European Championships . This time Hodgson wants to make the players in his senior squad who are eligible for the Under-21s available to Southgate to boost his chances of winning the tournament. The England manager said: 'I am certain there will be players (there) who will have made a (senior) appearance or will have been with us. 'We are going to say - ""Look, just because you have been with us for a while that doesn't make you a 100% bona fide senior that never plays anywhere else. It just makes you an England player and we are going to use you where we think best"".' Hodgson's view, which is shared by director of elite development Dan Ashworth, is that exposure to tournament football is vital for any England player, regardless of their age or talent. Jack Wilshere (right) is one of the senior England players who could still play for the England U21s . John Stones and Calum Chambers (right) have recently been called up to the England squad . Ross Barkley (centre) shoots for goal against Costa Rica during the World Cup in Brazil . It has not gone unnoticed that five members of the Germany team that beat Argentina in the World Cup final defeated England's Under-21s in the European Championship final six years ago. There are a host of players in the senior squad that Southgate could choose. Jack Wilshere, Phil Jones, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Raheem Sterling, John Stones, Calum Chambers, Ross Barkley and Luke Shaw are all eligible. After dropping just two points in their qualification campaign, Southgate is reluctant to draft in any top stars from the senior side though. The fact that England's seniors play a qualifier in Slovenia three days before the Under-21s championship starts would disrupt preparations for the Young Lions too. But should the Under-21s come through their October play-off, Hodgson will try to persuade Southgate to consider selecting some players who already have represented the senior side for the finals. Thomas Muller and Mesut Ozil (right) were part of the Germany team that beat England U21s six years ago . Teenager Luke Shaw is still young enough to play for England if they qualify for the European Championships . Roy Hodgson wants the likes of Raheem Sterling (right) to get more tournament experience . 'That's what the FA would like to happen,' Hodgson said. 'It will just be a question of Gareth and I sitting down and deciding which ones are the right ones to send. 'There is always going to be a risk that he and I decide that although this player could have done both we are not going to ask him to because he already has tournament experience, for example, or we think it's a bit unfair he has not been anywhere near the other ones and all of a sudden he jumps in. 'But it will be a real discussion point between Gareth and I and we get on very well in that respect. We both sing off the same hymn sheet.' Hodgson appears open to the idea of allowing the likes of Sterling, Wilshere and Barkley to compete in the tournament. When asked whether selection of senior players for the Under-21s should be restricted to those who do not play regular first-team football for their clubs, Hodgson replied: 'No. I am not putting any riders on it at all at the moment.' Hodgson put his faith in youth on Monday night and it paid off as England's inexperienced XI recorded an impressive 2-0 win in Switzerland, in a Euro 2016 qualifier. Fabian Delph impressed on his England debut against Swizterland on September 21 . John Stones started for England against Norway and Switzerland but made 'technical errors' in the latter . Fabian Delph impressed on his full debut and although 20-year-old Stones was guilty of committing 'technical errors', according to Hodgson, he looked relatively comfortable in his first competitive start too. Jack Colback, Danny Rose and Chambers all earned their first call-ups as Hodgson looked to draw a line under the winless World Cup campaign with a fresh-looking squad. After beating Switzerland, England's biggest qualification rivals, in such impressive fashion, Hodgson was glad he decided against turning to older, more experienced players like Gareth Barry and Jermain Defoe, whose international careers now look to be over. 'It was a case of me holding my nerve,' Hodgson said. 'I've tried to force myself to keep looking two years ahead.'","Hodgson keen to give players more tournament experience .

"Lazio could not make it five Serie A wins in a row as a Luca Toni penalty earned Hellas Verona a 1-1 draw at the Stadio Marc'Antonio Bentegodi. Senad Lulic gave the side from the capital the lead just before the break but when Luis Pedro Cavanda pulled back Juanito Gomez in the area to earn his second yellow card, Toni made no mistake from the spot. Lazio continued to press for a winner despite being down to 10 men but neither side could find the vital goal and the points were shared. Luca Toni sends Federico Marchetti the wrong way to earn Hellas Verona a 1-1 draw with Lazio . It was a quiet start with Nico Lopez's cross evading everyone and ending up safely in the arms of Lazio goalkeeper Federico Marchetti. Lucas Biglia then found an opening down the other end but his shot was high and wide as the visitors attempted to put their stamp on the game. Marchetti was beaten in the 21st minute as Toni controlled a ball over the top from Emil Hallfredsson beautifully with his right foot and rifled home with his left but the former Italy international as marginally offside. Barring that chances were at a premuim but Lazio were looking the more likely to score with Lulic heading weakly wide from a corner and Biglia blazing over again from distance. The veteran striker celebrates scoring his penalty, ending Lazio's four-game Serie A winning run . And they did just that three minutes before the break thanks to a howler from Vangelis Moras. Antonio Candreva crossed from the right and the Greek defender missed the ball completely as he swung a boot to clear, leaving Lulic to finish from three yards. Verona came out with purpose in the second half and Toni had three good chances to net the equaliser within four minutes. First Hallfredsson whipped in a free-kick which the veteran got on the end of but saw his shot saved by Rafael. Moments later he fired into the side-netting after showing great technique to hit a volley after the ball had ballooned off Stefan de Vrij but he will have been most disappointed to miss his next opportunity in the 54th minute. Filip Djordjevic and Senad Lulic celebrate after the latter opened the scoring on Thursday evening . Lopez went on a darting run down the right and provided the perfect cross for Toni but the 37-year-old could only head over the bar when he really should have done better. Despite those three chances, Lazio were playing the better football and enjoying the more possession but the home side were doing well to keep them at bay. The visitors continued to press but it was Verona who equalised from the penalty spot in the 69th minute when Cavanda was handed his marching orders. Luis Cavanda was sent off for two bookable offences, the second came when he gave away the penalty . The full-back had already been booked for an earlier foul and when he took a firm grip on the right wrist of Gomez in the box and pulled the substitute back, the referee had no choice but to point to the spot and produce a second card. Toni stepped up and sent Marchetti the wrong way, beating him low to his right, to level the scores. Despite being a man down, Lazio continued to force the issue and Marco Parolo produced a smart run and cross but Candreva could not get any power on his header. Gomez blazed a shot wide at the other end after Toni mishit his effort from the edge of the box - but neither side could find a winner.

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke is open to the idea of a foreigner succeeding Roy Hodgson - as long as the manager in question has a deep understanding of the English game. Dyke confirmed earlier this summer that Hodgson would remain Three Lions boss until his contract expires at the end of Euro 2016. Dyke says the FA board has not considered whether they should extend Hodgson's deal beyond that tournament and the England manager claims he has given it little thought himself. FA chairman Greg Dyke (right) has refused to rule out the possibility of a foreign coach managing England . Roy Hodgson will be England manager until after Euro 2016, but his future beyond that is uncertain . Dyke mentioned the possibility of a Frenchman taking over as manager of England - Arsene Wenger (pictured) has been touted in the past . 'My four-year plan is to stay alive,' Hodgson quipped last week at a press conference at Wembley. Should the FA decide to opt for a change after Euro 2016, which is likely given that Hodgson will be nearing his 69th birthday then, a foreign manager could be considered. The FA was criticised for appointing Fabio Capello and Sven-Goran Eriksson before Hodgson's tenure, but Dyke is refusing to rule out going down the same road again this time around. 'They wouldn't necessarily have to be English but they certainly would have to understand English football,' Dyke told Press Association Sport at an FA grassroots event in Lowestoft. 'You wouldn't rule out someone who is a Scot or Welsh or French but they would have to understand English football.' The mention of a Frenchman from Dyke is interesting given that Arsene Wenger was reported to have been considered as a possible candidate for the England job in the past. Still, Dyke is not in a hurry to start considering who should take the post and when. 'We haven't thought that far ahead,' Dyke said. Hodgson restored some faith to the nation's football fans by guiding England to an impressive 2-0 win over Switzerland in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier last month. Wayne Rooney (right), named England captain after this summer's World Cup, will be eager to impress . Hodgson's squad met for the first time since that victory on Monday as they started preparations for this week's qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia. All 21 players, including Arsenal defender Calum Chambers, who has replaced the injured John Stones, reported for duty on Monday at St George's Park, where the squad is due to undertake a light training session. The build-up to the double-header was overshadowed by Hodgson's decision to omit Daniel Sturridge from his squad, even though the striker was in contention to play for Liverpool against West Brom last weekend. The former Chelsea man, who suffered a thigh injury on international duty last month, did not play against the Baggies and Hodgson is now hoping to move on from the matter. 'It's all about the fitness of a player who was injured unfortunately on England duty last time, and he hasn't recovered so he is not fit to play,' Hodgson said in an interview with Good Morning Britain. 'If he was fit to play then I would have expected him to be with us.' Sturridge's absence means Danny Welbeck will be given another chance to lead the line after his fine brace against the Swiss. Captain Wayne Rooney will also be eager to make an impression given that he is currently sidelined from action with Manchester United because of a three-match ban. Rooney will join Jimmy Greaves as England's third highest goalscorer of all time if he finds the net on three more occasions over the next week. 'I hope he does (reach Greaves' landmark). I want him to score as many goals as possible,' said Hodgson of Rooney, who is eight short of Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time record. 'It's not all about goals. It's all about victories. It will be good for his confidence though. Goals are goals.' Despite concerns about a low turn-out, it is understood that around 50,000 fans are expected to be at Thursday's match against San Marino - around 10,000 more than attended the September friendly against Norway. England will then take on Estonia in Tallinn on Sunday. Around 15,000 fans are expected to attend England's Under-21 play-off against Croatia at Molineux on Friday.","Roy Hodgson will remain England manager until at least after Euro 2016 .

"The Manchester derby is one of the fiercest rivalries in world football. Despite their struggles this season, City and United are among the biggest clubs in the country and there will be hundreds of millions of pounds worth of talent on show at the Etihad Stadium. But who has the better players? Does red or blue come out on top when their stars are judged by Sportsmail's High Court? Scroll down to find out... VIDEO Scroll down to watch Yaya Toure hail the singings of Falcao and Di Maria . The likely line-ups for Manchester City against United on Sunday . Goalkeeper:  Joe Hart vs David de Gea . The Manchester United goalkeeper has established himself as one of the best stoppers in the Barclays Premier League. He has transformed from the lightweight youngster who joined the club to a heavyweight of the side who is often relied upon to keep them in matches. Manchester City's Joe Hart, in comparison, is too prone to mistakes and his position in the team is all-too often questioned. VERDICT: Hart 8/10 De Gea 9 . David de Gea has enjoyed a fine start to the season in goal for Manchester United . Joe Hart just fails to keep out Diafra Sakho's header in Manchester City's defeat by West Ham . Right back: Pablo Zabaleta vs Rafael . Zabaleta is one of the best full backs in the world, tirelessly running up and down that flank all game. He is almost as important to City's attack as he is their defence. Rafael, however, is is a liability at right back for United. VERDICT: Zabaleta 8 Rafael 6 . Pablo Zabaleta (left) is one of the world's best full backs whereas Rafael is a liability . Centre back: Vincent Kompany vs Chris Smalling . Neither defence has covered themselves in glory this season, with City conceding too many soft goals, but United's centre of defence has been terrible for much of the season. Kompany is much better than Smalling, that's all there is to it. VERDICT: Kompany 9 Smalling 6 . Vincent Kompany is the leader of City's defence, even if he is not quite at his imperious best . Chris Smalling wrestles Branislav Ivanovic to the ground in United's draw against Chelsea . Centre back: Martin Demichelis vs Marcos Rojo . Demichelis was a liability for part of last season but rallied and is now seen as a safe option at the heart of City's defence. Rojo is a better full back than a centre half and seems to struggle with the physicality of the Premier League. VERDICT: Demichelis 7 Rojo 6 . Martin Demichelis (left) has turned his City career around but compatriot Marcos Rojo seems lightweight . Left back: Gael Clichy vs Luke Shaw . Shaw has had a troubled start to his career at United, struggling for fitness and with injury, but since he has got back into the side he is starting to find the form that made him the best young full back in the country. City's Gael Clichy has looked slow and off-the-pace recently, and lacks the ability of Shaw even when fully fit. VERDICT: Clichy 7 Shaw 8 . Gael Clichy is beaten in the air by Sakho and has looked off the pace this season . Luke Shaw (right) is finding his feet after a slow start to his United career . Midfielder: Fernando vs Daley Blind . Blind, at United, can seemingly play anywhere but is making a strong case for being a regular holding midfielder. He can screen the back four as well as join the attack to do damage to opponents. Fernando seems to have struggled a bit since his arrival at City. VERDICT: Fernando 7 Blind 8 . Fernando seems to have struggled since arriving at City but Daley Blind (right) is United's midfield screen . Midfielder: James Milner vs Michael Carrick . Milner has had a very good start to the season and has been rewarded with starts in the majority of City's matches. His energy is very useful to Pellegrini. This would be Carrick's first match of the season but when he's on form he makes United tick. VERDICT: Milner 7 Carrick 7 . The industrious James Milner (right) challenges Jack Colback in City's defeat by Newcastle . Michael Carrick, at training on Friday, is in line to start his first match of the season for United . Midfielder: Yaya Toure vs Marouane Fellaini . The battle of the big men in midfield. Even if he is well off his usual form this season, Toure is one of the league's powerhouses and there is always the potential for a goal from nowhere. Fellaini seems to have turned a corner after his goal at West Brom and lung-busting performance against Chelsea. Toure is still his better, however. VERDICT: Toure 8 Fellaini 7 . Yaya Toure has been below par this season but can still dominate the midfield . Marouane Fellaini looked reinvigorated against Chelsea and here takes on Gary Cahill . Attacking midfielder: Samir Nasri vs Angel di Maria . The Argentine has been played on either flank for United and creates magic with that left foot. Although what he produces is no illusion – he can pick out a man with a pass or score from virtually anywhere and his pace can take him away from opponents. Nasri is more of a touch player and sometimes seems to go missing - but can also produce a goal or a pass from nothing. VERDICT: Nasri 8 Di Maria 9 . Samir Nasri (right) is City's creative spark and will hope to unlock the United defence . Angel di Maria can create chances from set-pieces and in open play and will be vital for United . Striker: Edin Dzeko vs Robin van Persie . Both cost more than £25m but are their club's secondary striker. Neither centre forward has fired this season - Dzeko has scored just twice in the Premier League (although one was a beauty at Hull) and Van Persie has looked off-colour since the World Cup, although United will hope the last-gasp equaliser against Chelsea will galvanise the Dutchman. VERDICT: Dzeko 7 Van Persie 8 . Edin Dzeko has failed to fire this season for City and was in the side that lost against Newcastle . Robin van Persie (right) slams in the equaliser against Chelsea and United hope there will be many more . Striker: Sergio Aguero vs Wayne Rooney . Now on to the talismanic centre forwards. Aguero's record this season speaks for itself: 11 goals in 13 games in all competitions, eight goals in his last seven, joint-top scorer in the Premier League with nine. Although less prolific this season, Rooney will be champing at the bit after his three-match suspension and will lead United's attack . VERDICT: Aguero 9 Rooney 8 .

Substitutes not used: Ryan Sandford (GK; Millwall) The result meant a losing start for new England Under 16 coach Steve Cooper as the team seek to continue their dominance of the competition this century. It was a scrappy opening at the Book People Stadium, with Chelsea midfielder Mason Mount enjoying the best chance when his free-kick flew over the crossbar. At the other end, Wales had their best chance when Tyler Roberts played through Matty Smith, only for the Manchester City teenager to fire just wide of the right-hand post. Ben Woodburn did hit the target for Wales just after the half-hour but was denied by an offside flag. The hosts were handed a massive let-off just before half-time when their keeper, Scott Coughlan, parried the ball straight out to Tottenham's Keanan Bennetts who conspired to shoot wide from just five yards.

"The career of Philip Fenton is hanging in the balance after the Irish Turf Club confirmed it will launch its own investigation in the aftermath of the Irish trainer being found guilty of possessing banned anabolic steroids. Cheltenham Festival-winner Fenton, 49, was  fined 6,000 euros on Thursday and ordered to pay costs of 4,200 euros after a County Tipperary court handed down a eight guilty verdicts for possessing unlicenced animal remedies. Among them was 1kg of Nitrotain, enough for 250 doses. The court was told it was hard to find a more potent a source of Anabolic Steroids. Philip Fenton's career is hanging in the balance after the Irish Turf Club confirmed it will launch an investigation . Horse trainer Fenton (left) and solicitor Ken Molan arrive at Carrick-on-Suir District Court on Thursday . Nitrotain contains Ethylestranol which improves muscle mass and stamina and toughens bones in horses. Also found was a 20ml bottle of Ilium Stanabolic, containing the performance-enhancing Anabolic Steroid Stanozolol as well as prescription only medications without the necessary paperwork. Ministry of Agriculture vets found the illegal drugs in a cardboard box covered by a horse blanket in a ‘horse spa’ close to Fenton’s medicine store in a raid in January 2012. As he left the hearing in Carrick-on-Suir, Fenton said only that he was considering an appeal against the verdict but he could face interview by Turf Club Officials by as early as next week. Turf Club chief executive Denis Egan said: ‘No horses have tested positive but that fact that Anabolic Steroids have been found is a very serious matter. ‘We will want to move this forward as quickly as possible.’ Trainer Fenton was found guilty of possessing banned Anabolic Steroids and his career remains precarious . An attempt by Fenton’s legal team to have the case dismissed because protocols has been breached during the investigation was dismissed by Judge Timothy Lucey. Fenton, a former amateur jockey, has been training since 2004. His biggest win in Britain came when Dunguib landed the Cheltenham Festival Bumper in 2008. He also won the Irish Hennessy Gold Cup with Last Instalment at Leopardstown in February. The pair were part of a three-horse team that Fenton ran at last season’s Festival but only after the horses had been tested by BHA officials. Fenton’s case follows a similar fine being handed down to Irish National winning trainer Pat Hughes earlier this month after he was also sound guilty of possessing illegal substances including Anabolic Steroids. The cases have cast a dark cloud over Irish racing. The Anabolic Steroids involved are the same used by disgraced trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni in the case which heaped shame on Sheik Mohammed’s Godolphin operation last year.","The Irish Turf Club confirmed it will launch its own investigation .

"Irish trainer Philip Fenton had one kilo of anabolic steroids in his stables when veterinary inspectors carried out a raid, a court has been told.

The substances include a quantity of steroid Nitrotain and a 20ml bottle of a second performance enhancing drug, Ilium Stanabolic.

The prosecution is being brought in the name of Ireland's Minister for Agriculture for infringements of rules on animal remedies. Both the BHA and the Irish Turf Club are monitoring the case.

"Neil Redfearn has agreed to become the Leeds new manager, but only on the understanding he can revert to his academy role if it doesn't work out. The 49-year-old is ready to try and tame trigger-happy owner Massimo Cellino by accepting a long-term deal at Elland Road. Redfearn is back in charge of the first-team after Cellino sacked Darko Milanic just 32 days after appointing him. Neil Redfearn is expected to take permanent charge of Leeds United in the coming days . Redfearn will want assurances that he can resume his job in the academy if the role does not work out . The axing of the Slovenian was entirely in keeping with his past, with the controversial Italian having seen off 36 managers in 22 years with Italian side Cagliari, . When Redfearn puts pen to paper, he will become the fourth permanent Leeds boss in the last five months. The former Barnsley, Crystal Palace and Watford midfielder is willing to take the plunge, though, leaving behind his work with the club's academy and trying to be the man who takes Leeds back to the Premier League. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post, Redfearn said: 'I had a meeting with Massimo today. Nothing has been put down in concrete, but I wanted to see how he saw it going forward. 'I don't want this to be a short-term thing, that is no good for anybody. 'He told me that he sees me here for the long haul and that he wanted me here with him and that he does not see this as a short-term thing. 'I get on really well with him and work well with him and understand where he is coming from. He is genuinely trying to do well for the club and I can do with that.' Leeds owner Massimo Cellino appointed Darko Milanic last month, but sacked him after just 32 days . Milanic was appointed on a two-year deal but did not even last two months... he is now contemplating his future . Redfearn, who made over 1,000 appearances as a player, is best know for captaining Barnsley to the Premier League, but he is a lifelong Leeds fan whose ascent to the top job has been a long time in the making. In his fourth, and what appears to be final, spell as caretaker between David Hockaday and Milanic he picked up 10 points from 12 and was considered unlucky to miss out on the permanent job ahead of the latter. Once Redfearn's appointment is formalised then Milanic's brief reign will be completely consigned to the history books, although he says he will be paid until 2016 and as such is available to the club should they want him back. The 46-year-old is beginning to contemplate rebuilding a career that only five weeks ago was being spent with Austrian side Sturm Graz - a club where he is adored after a successful spell as a player. Leeds' loss to Wolves at the weekend was the final straw for Cellino, who sacked Milanic afterwards . Cellino reacts while watching the game alongside Redfearn, who he will appoint permanently . He says he can do so knowing Leeds are still paying him, though, and was quoted as telling Radio Slovenia: 'I still have a contract on paid leave. 'During this time, I must be ready to take over the team if requested by the owner.' That technically opens the door for a return to Elland Road before the expiry of his contract in two years' time - something not unheard of in Italy. Any return looks unlikely, however, with Cellino - who appointed Milanic saying 'he's good looking' - admitting he had made a mistake. Milanic insists, though, that he does not regret making the move, having bought out his contract with Graz in order to head to England. 'In six games with the team I made a big step forward,' he said. 'It is true that we had bad results, but the day before the game we had praise from all sides on how the situation was improving. 'I do not believe I made a mistake in joining Leeds. I just wish that someone would believe in me. 'Cellino said I'm a loser? He should look at my CV.' Should Cellino and Redfearn fall out, United's vice-president and Cellino's son, Edoardo, believes he will return to his job at the academy. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post, he said: 'Even if my father and him fall down he will go back to the academy. But I know he's going to do a great job.' And according to Edoardo Cellino, the 32 days afforded to Milanic is a long time compared to some who have worked for his dad. 'I remember in Italy my dad sacked seven coaches in one year and one before the season had even started. This is not a record.'","Neil Redfearn is poised to become Leeds' manager on a permanent basis .

"Marouane Fellaini has finally adapted to life at Manchester United and is finally ready to show his best form, according to former Old Trafford captain Bryan Robson. The Belgian looked completely out of place last season following his £27.5m move from Everton in the closing minutes of the 2013 summer transfer window. Indeed, the 26-year-old was a convenient scapegoat for the shortcomings of the David Moyes era at United with his lightweight performances in midfield. Marouane Fellaini impressed for Manchester United against Chelsea on Sunday and has finally started to find his feet at Old Trafford following a poor first season at the club . The powerful Belgian helped United to a 1-1 draw against Premier League leaders Chelsea on Sunday . But even though an ankle injury delayed him at the start of this season, Fellaini is starting to show his true ability under Louis van Gaal. He came off the bench to score in last Monday's 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion and produced an excellent performance to help United to a 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Sunday. And Robson, who played for the club between 1981 and 1994, believes Fellaini finally fits in at United. 'I think Fellaini has been one of these players who's come to Man United and found it totally different to any other club,' he told the Manchester Evening News. United legend Bryan Robson believes Fellaini has finally adapted to the demands of life at United . Robson at the peak of his powers, playing for United against Barcelona in 1984 . 'The expectations, and the way United are expected to play football from the fans. 'The first season, he didn't really find his feet, but I think he knows what it's all about now and the last couple of performances have been very good. 'He's found where he is. He knows what's expected now and he seems to have settled down and is playing the football he was playing for Everton.' Fellaini's display against Chelsea - which was described as 'fantastic' by striker Robin van Persie - means Van Gaal is likely to start him in Sunday's derby with Manchester City at the Etihad. Fellaini announced his return to form with a well-taken goal in United's 2-2 draw at West Brom last week . Fellaini's return to form has given manager Louis van Gaal a selection dilemma ahead of the City match . The Belgian could be the perfect player to take on the physical power of Yaya Toure and Fernando in the centre of the park. Robson added: 'You have to have a physical presence against Chelsea and Manchester City because, if you're weak, they'll just roll over the top of you. 'They're big powerful teams and they're successful. I can see Fellaini playing again because he's the type of player we need against Manchester City to cope with them.'","Marouane Fellaini performed impressively against West Brom and Chelsea .

"French-trained Karakontie prevented a first blank for Europe at the Breeders’ Cup since 2007 when landing the $2million Mile at Santa Anita in California. But there was agony for Jamie Osborne’s Toast Of New York, who was just touched by Bayern when second in the $5million Classic. The consolation for Jamie Spencer’s mount, who himself was just in front of Kentucky Derby winner California Chrome in third, was prize money of over £500,000. Jockey Stephane Pasquier rides Karakontie to victory it the Breeders' Cup Mile horse race at Santa Anita Park . For a few tense minutes after the race, it still seemed as if Toast Of New York might still get the win as Bob Baffert-trained Bayern and his jockey Martin Garcia had to survive a stewards’ enquiry after jinking left at the stalls and hampering fourth-placed Shared Belief. But the result ultimately stood. Meanwhile, the Jonathan Pease-trained Karakontie, ridden by Stephane Pasquier, held off Freddie Head-trained Anodin with David Simcock’s Trade Storm third to win his race. Dermot Weld’s Mustajeeb was sixth but there was disappointment for Richard Hannon-trained favourite Toronado. Pasquier celebrates after riding Karakontie to victory . On his final run, the Queen Anne Stakes winner drifted and faded into eighth of the 14 starters after racing prominently under a tactically aggressive ride from champion jockey Richard Hughes. Karakontie, a 16-1 shot on account of his tough wide draw, had been beaten in two runs since his French Guineas success, having had a poor draw in the French Derby and a hampered run in the Prix de la Foret. Pease said: ‘It’s a great result. He was a brilliant two-year-old and was very good this spring. We gave him a break and he showed a great turn of foot today.’ Pasquier added: ‘This is the biggest win of my career, to win a Breeders’ Cup race here in America. The trainer didn’t give me any instructions. I just rode him like the quality horse he is. ‘I had a bad draw on the outside but got a good position. It is easier when you are on the best horse in the race and he gave me everything and quickened very well.’","Karakontie lands $2million Breeders' Cup Mile .

"These two sides will not be able to call each other London rivals for much longer but you suspect the fierce derby atmosphere witnessed here last night may endure for some years to come. This may have been an unwanted 5pm made-for-television kick-off but the intensity on display — both on and off the field — went some way towards eradicating any Sunday night blues the crowd may have been feeling. Even as the final whistle drew near, Quins centre George Lowe and his Wasps counterpart Elliot Daly still somehow mustered the energy to scrap fiercely on the ground. The Quins player edged it. Such was the nature of the game. Charlie Matthews slides in to score his try during a stand-out performance for Quins against Wasps . Despite an energy-sapping battle, George Lowe and Eliot Daly still had the strength for a late scrap . In the end, it was Harlequins who deservedly recorded their second successive European Champions Cup win and they enter the autumn international period top of Pool 2. Coventry-bound Wasps finished with their second losing bonus point but it was Quins who disappeared into the Wycombe night feeling as confident as they have done at any point this season. ‘I’m delighted with that performance in so many ways,’ said Quins director of rugby Conor O’Shea. ‘People will say when teams are physical against us we can’t play but the game’s about mind-set. If belief was coursing through us I think we’d have taken more of the chances we created but winning in the way we did will make us even stronger mentally.’ England captain Chris Robshaw put in an excellent display as the Quins pack dominated at Adams Park . The exceptional Matthews, still on 23 years old, is surely an England star of the future . It would appear after a slow start, which insiders put down largely to their willingness to give their England contingent a decent lay-off during the summer, the west London club are stirring. In man of the match Charlie Matthews, they have a young lock who will surely grace the international stage soon. Saracens’ 24-year-old George Kruis was one of Stuart Lancaster’s uncapped picks last week but the hulking Matthews — superb in the line out and athletic around the field — cannot be far behind. Quins are close to signing Wallaby lock James Horwill but, on this evidence, and the evidence of much of the past 12 months, Matthews is a player with a very bright future indeed. Danny Care tries to kick in behind the Wasps defence during the hard-fought Champions Cup contest . Andy Goode celebrates as Joe Simpson runs in for his try, Wasps only one of the game . It was a superb solo effort from Simpson, putting Wasps 8-6 ahead after just half an hour, but Quins hit back . ‘He’s 23 and he’s had two or three years at the coalface,’ said O’Shea. ‘He’s a big man who will get used to his body and his best is two or three years down the line. He’s just so big and it sometimes takes time. ‘But you can see it coming. He’s a strong player who understands his game is to be physical. And he’s a good lineout forward. It’s nice that young English players are getting an opportunities.’ O’Shea’s men outscored Wasps by two tries to one, while Nick Evans kicked five from seven. Joe Simpson’s superb solo try had seen Wasps take an 8-6 lead on the half-hour. But Matthews latched on to a sweeping Quins move just before the break to gallop in from 20 metres. He continued to impress after the interval, thanks in part to some vastly improved throwing in from hooker Dave Ward, as the visitors’ pack squeezed Wasps for all they were worth. Nick Easter thunders into a Daly tackle as the visiting pack continued to find the edge over Wasps . Nick Evans prepares to kick one of his three penalties as the Quins 10 picked up 13 points in the win . Without captain James Haskell, who suffered a nasty viral infection which kept in hospital for much of last week, Wasps’ pack lacked drive and were outmuscled by a Quins eight full of outstanding performers, not least England captain Chris Robshaw. Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said: ‘We were second best in most areas and I thought we looked a flat, tired team today. Quins were by far the best team. We’ve got no excuses. We came second best and I thought the score flattered us. That was a reality check for us.’ O’Shea was keen to play down concerns over the quad injury which saw prop Joe Marler withdraw from the game after initially being named in the starting XV, while Young also bristled at a question about the newly introduced Head Injury Assessment after Andy Goode and Daly both returned to the field having left it looking noticeably groggy. Dai Young, who bristled at a question about head injuries, looks dejected as Wasps lost their second game . ‘From my point of view and anybody’s point of view at the club we’d never put any player at risk,’ said Young. ‘We’ll certainly follow any protocol to the letter.’","Young second row puts in superb display for Harlequins .

"David Silva has been ruled out of the Manchester derby with a knee ligament problem.

Pellegrini referred to a 'lack of trust' among his players after the Newcastle result but is convinced they will soon get back to their best. He said: 'I think they know perfectly what we are doing and I am absolutely sure we will return to our normal performance.

Both sides have made an indifferent start to the season, with United trailing their arch rivals by four points in the Premier League after nine games. Last season City achieved a league double against United with resounding 4-1 and 3-0 wins at home and away on their way to the title.

'Beating City – as United’s new group of players should know by now ahead of Sunday’s game – is a vital part of life at the club,' he wrote in his column for the Independent. City go into the clash on the back of successive defeats suffered at the hands of West Ham in the Premier League and a suprising 2-0 home loss against Newcastle in the Capital One Cup fourth round - something Scholes believes is down to Manuel Pellegrini's side's arrogant approach to certain matches.

Klopp introduced Shinji Kagawa with 20 minutes to go as they continued to press but an equaliser didn't come.

"Dominic King saw the late Liverpool comeback at Anfield. Read the match report HERE... Mario Balotelli sparked a dramatic late comeback as Liverpool beat Swansea 2-1 in the Capital One Cup last night but then sparked controversy by tussling with former Anfield midfielder Jonjo Shelvey. The Italian striker pulled out of the warm up before kick-off after feeling a twinge in his knee but was sent on as a last throw of the dice by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers as his team trailed by a goal with 20 minutes to go. This time Balotelli didn't let Rodgers down as he scored the equaliser with a left foot volley in front of the Kop with four minutes to go. Then, in injury time, Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren scored the winner with a header at the far post after Swansea had been reduced to ten men. Mario Balotelli equalises for Liverpool within seconds of his introduction with a volley between two Swansea defenders on 86 minutes . Jordan Henderson gets between Balotelli and Jonjo Shelvey as the pair continue their argument as they enter the Anfield tunnel . Philippe Coutinho congratulates Balotelli after he scores only his second goal for Liverpool since his summer move from AC Milan . However, there was still time for Balotelli to end the night on a sour note as he tussled with Shelvey after the final whistle. The two players – along with Swansea captain Ashley Williams – seemed to clash after Balotelli flicked Shelvey's ear. The players parted as Shelvey went to applaud the Swansea fans but then exchanged words again in the players' tunnel. Afterwards Liverpool assistant manager Colin Pascoe said: 'That is Mario. He is working hard and he got his just rewards coming on and getting the goal. He works hard and I am glad he got the goal. Balotelli appears to antagonise former Liverpool midfielder Shelvey by flicking his ear as the pair leave the pitch at the final whistle . Never far away from controversy, Balotelli has an argument with Shelvey in front of officials at the end of the game on Tuesday . The mercurial Italian sees the funny side as players from both sides intervene in the controversy sparked by Balotelli at full-time . Referee Keith Stroud attempts to restore order between the pair but tempers flared again when the players went down the tunnel .

Subs not used: Fabianski, Bartley, Shephard, Barrow. Booked: Fulton, Taylor, Williams . Sent off: Fernandez . Scorer: Emnes 65' Referee: Keith Stroud . Att : 42,582 . 'It is great for Mario he wants to work all the time. He is a resilient lad with a tremendous talent. He wants to work on his movement and his finishing.' Balotelli went in early during the warm-up, sparking a radio report that suggested he had been sent in for not taking the drills seriously. Liverpool categorically denied this, though, revealing that he had to see the physio after catching his studs in the Anfield turf. 'He was sent in because he twisted his studs in the ground,' said Pascoe. 'He felt something in his knee so he was sent in to see the physio. 'We had to assess him. He felt something in his knee. He is fine but he went to take a precaution.' Swansea looked on their way to a memorable win after taking the lead in the second half but were pegged back by Balotelli and then hit by a red card for Federico Fernandez that looked harsh. 'I can see why they are not happy,' added Pascoe. 'I didn't think it was a sending off. I think they both slipped.' Swansea manager Gary Monk appealed for referee Keith Stroud to overturn the dismissal. He said: 'If anything, the Liverpool player's foot is higher than ours. 'Keith is a good referee, hopefully he will see sense and rescind it. I said to the boys that these decisions are happening. 'Hopefully they will stop it happening but if not we do it the hard way. I am not here to have a go at refs but it's being proven week after week. 'I am not talking rubbish, I am talking sense. I was emotional recently at Stoke but what is the point? It is not getting me anywhere.' Asked about the incident between Shelvey and Balotelli, Monk said he hadn't seen anything. 'I didn't see that,' he said. 'No, nothing.' Swansea were left with ten men for the final few minutes after Federico Fernandez was sent off for a rough challenge of Coutinho .

"Arsenal are not as good as Borussia Dortmund, according to Anderlecht midfielder Steven Defour. Arsene Wenger's side were given a Champions League scare on Wednesday night as they needed two late goals from Kieran Gibbs and Lukas Podolski to beat the Belgian champions 2-1. And Defour said after the match that the Gunners were too reliant on individual moments of brilliance to break down the Anderlecht defence, unlike the more cohesive Dortmund.

'Arsenal were hoping for a moment of brilliance from Alexis Sanchez or Danny Welbeck and didn't have many runners from midfield. Dortmund's midfielders seemed to be coming from everywhere three weeks ago,' Defour told Goal. 'Three weeks ago, Dortmund outplayed us and we have to accept they were the better team, but I don't think Arsenal were stronger than we were.'

'They can play some great football, so we needed that bit of extra certainty. We wanted to hit them on the counterattack and I think we did well.'

"Shinji Kagawa scored one  and set up another Tuesday as Borussia Dortmund put aside its Bundesliga troubles with a 3-0 win at St. Pauli in the German Cup. Dortmund, last season's beaten finalist, was looking for relief after losing its last four league games, and started strongly against the second-division side in Hamburg. Ciro Immobile, who arguably had a good goal ruled out for offside early on, opened the scoring in the 33rd minute. Kevin Grosskreutz cut the ball back and Kagawa helped it on for the Italy striker to convert from close range.

Immobile then set up Marco Reus to make in 2-0 in the 44th, before the home side improved in the second half. Florian Kringe went narrowly close with a deflected shot and Dortmund `keeper Mitch Langerak did well to save from Dennis Daube. But Kagawa settled any nerves by sealing the result with four minutes remaining after a poor clearance from St. Pauli goalkeeper Philipp Tschauner. Kagawa also scored in his previous German Cup game. In May 2012, in his first stint at the club, he helped Dortmund to a memorable 5-2 win over Bayern Munich in the final. 'We can be happy with the result, also with the first half. Not with the second. We played too little football in it,' said Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp, whose side next faces Bayern in the Bundesliga on Saturday.

Fin Bartels finished off a clever pass from Izet Hajrovic to open the scoring in the 31st minute, and Argentine forward Franco di Santo beat the Chemnitz `keeper at his near post in the 49th. Former under-23 coach Skripnik took over the Bundesliga's bottom club on Saturday, when predecessor Robin Dutt was sacked after claiming just four points from nine league games.

"Kimi Raikkonen is adamant he made the right decision in returning to Ferrari despite experiencing a disappointing season to date. Raikkonen has scored just 47 points from the 16 races ahead of this weekend's US Grand Prix, compared to team-mate Fernando Alonso's total of 141. The 35-year-old has previously made clear F1's switch to the 1.6-litre V6 era, leading to a re-design of the car, has not worked in his favour. Kimi Raikkonen is adamant he made the right decision in returning to Ferrari despite his disappointing season . The 35-year-old can take comfort from the fact that his old team, Lotus, have gone backwards since he left . The 2007 world champion has qualified no higher than fifth, with his best race finish that of fourth in Belgium in August. It is understandably not the scenario Raikkonen would have envisaged when he opted to quit Lotus last season and rejoin Ferrari, the team he served between 2007 and 2009. In his absence, however, Lotus have gone backwards, leaving the 35-year-old Finn to appreciate his circumstances, even if they may not be to his liking. 'For sure I made the 100 per cent right decision (to join Ferrari),' said Raikkonen. 'Obviously the results haven't been what I wanted, or what the team wants, but that's how it goes. 'We have improved from where we started the season and there have been some better moments. Fernando Alonso has scored 141 points so far this season while Raikkonen has scored just 47 . Raikkonen finished Friday's practice session at the Circuit of the Americas sixth quickest, behind Alonso . 'But it's not been easy to fix some issues and get things exactly as you want. 'You end up having a small issue here, a small issue there and the end result is you pay a big price for it. But I'm happy to be here. 'Finishing anything after first place I'd rather be in a Ferrari than for any other team, so for sure I made the right decision.'

"Formula One's sparring championship protagonists Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg again proved there is little to separate them. In-form Hamilton emerged top dog from Rosberg at the end of Friday's two practice sessions for the United States Grand Prix by a hair's breadth, just three thousandths of a second. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton maintained his focus despite a hydraulic problem on Friday . Hamilton had topped FP1 at the Circuit of the Americas by a clear 0.293secs from Rosberg, with McLaren's Jenson Button their closest challenger. But in switching from the medium-compound tyres used in FP1 to the soft Pirelli rubber given an outing in FP2, Rosberg managed to reel in his Mercedes team-mate. Hamilton's day also ended under a slight cloud as his car encountered a hydraulic problem with 20 minutes remaining, bringing an early end to his day's running. It underlined the fact that despite winning the last four grands prix to open up a 17-point cushion to Rosberg, Hamilton's hopes of claiming a second title rest as much on the reliability of his car over the final three races as his own talent. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel prepares for practice session at the Circuit of the Americas, in Austin, Texas . Toro Rosso's seventeen-year-old test driver Max Verstappen from speaks to his team in the pits . With Hamilton on a roll, the Briton holds a 17-point cushion going into one of his favourite races of the year in the United States on Sunday. With nine victories already this season - only Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel have won more in a single campaign - Hamilton is confident of keeping the momentum going. 'I don't see why not,' said Hamilton. 'Nico's obviously going to be strong this weekend, and he's going to be pushing, but the tables could always turn. 'Nico has shown that this year, every race he bounces back, but I've been strong here in the past, and I'm hoping to be very strong here this weekend. 'The last few races I've really felt great, amazing. It was almost like there was a wall in front of me and I was trying to climb it but I couldn't quite get over it. 'But I've got over it now and hopefully the remaining races are more like hurdles rather than big tall walls.' Lewis Hamilton poses in front of a fans' banner in the pit lane in Austin on Friday . Hamilton and Nico Rosberg were head and shoulders above any of their rivals, with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso the best of the rest, and not for the first time this season. Alonso finished a staggering 1.104secs adrift of Hamilton, such is the performance advantage of the Mercedes at this track. Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, who only completed five laps in FP1 due to his car encountering an ERS (energy recovery system) problem, was back on track in FP2. Ricciardo rattled off 29 laps to finish fourth quickest, whilst in contrast team-mate Sebastian Vettel propped up the timesheet. It was confirmed in between the two sessions the team had installed a complete power unit, and with it being the sixth of the season, the outgoing four-times champion serves a penalty that will see him start from the pit lane. However, Vettel almost immediately encountered problems with the new system as he managed only 19 laps, finishing nearly five seconds off the pace. Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg, pulls out of the garage during the first practice session . Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton pulls out of the pits during the first practice session for the U.S. Grand Prix . Significantly, Vettel was last of only 18 cars - the financial problems encountered by Caterham and Marussia over the past week forcing both teams into administration. With both teams and out of this event, it means the field for this weekend's race will be the lowest since the 2005 Monaco Grand Prix.

Significantly, in the dying stages of the second session the FIA tested their new virtual safety car (VSC) system. The device has been introduced in the wake of Jules Bianchi's life-threatening crash in the Japanese Grand Prix nearly four weeks ago. Bianchi went off the Suzuka circuit under double-waved yellow-flag conditions, forcing the FIA to experiment with the VSC - which forces a driver to slow significantly via a signal sent to the cockpit of his car.","Hamilton emerged ahead of Rosberg at the end of Friday's two practice sessions .

"Toxic: A customer alert has been issued over traces of Rhodamine B and Auramine in sweets . Illegal and potentially carcinogenic food dyes, some used in the sewage industry, have been found in children's sweets in West Yorkshire. A major customer alert has now been issued over the fluorescent versions of traditional Asian sweets, after traces of Rhodamine B and Auramine were found in samples sold in Bradford and Kirklees. The fluorescent pink or yellow dyes are not allowed to be used in food production and are most commonly found in the sewage industry, where they can help to locate leaks. The problem was picked up through a testing programme, where samples of Asian sweets had been taken from a number of outlets across the region and tested by the West Yorkshire Public Analyst. Criminal investigations have now begun but a trading standards spokesman said it appeared that the contaminated sweets were not all coming from a single supplier and as a result not all the sources had yet been identified. Councillor Val Slater, chairman of the West Yorkshire Trading Standards committee and a Bradford councillor, said: 'These brightly-coloured sweets, made from milk and sugar, are especially attractive to children therefore, in order to protect their health, it is important they are removed from sale.' 'Anyone who has a legitimate concern relating to these items, should contact the helpline,' she added. Rhodamine B appears green in powder form but when added to water turns a vivid fluorescent pink. It is not a permitted food colour and is considered to be potentially carcinogenic. It is commonly used to stain slides in laboratories and in the sewage industry to test for leaks in drains. Auramine appears yellow or orange in both powder and liquid forms, it is also commonly used to stain laboratory slides. It is not a permitted food colour and is also potentially carcinogenic. Contaminated: The fluorescent pink or yellow dyes are not allowed to be used in food production and are most commonly found in the sewage industry, where they can help to locate leaks (file image) A trading standards spokesman said both illegal dyes would fluoresce under ultraviolet light, which could help food outlets and customers identify them. Consumers and businesses are being asked to be vigilant and report any sweets which glow under ultraviolet light to trading standards through the Citizens' Advice Consumer Helpline on 08454 040506. Last week businesses selling traditional Asian sweets were being urged to contact their suppliers to ask whether the illegal dyes were present in products. If they were an ingredient, the sweets should be removed from sale immediately, the spokesman said.","Traces of Rhodamine B and Auramine found in sweets in West Yorkshire .

"Nico Rosberg will start Sunday's United State Grand Prix ahead of championship rival and Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton after a blistering final qualifying session in Austin, Texas. Hamilton was fastest in Q1 ahead of Felipe Massa, Valtteri Bottas with Rosberg back in fourth but the German showed a statement of intent in the second session with his lap 0.997 faster than Hamilton in second. Rosberg then backed up that performance when it mattered in Q3 to confirm a ninth pole start for the season as he looks to make up Hamilton's 17-point world championship advantage. Click here for the full qualifying report . Host commentator . Make no mistake, Hamilton won't like being beaten fair and square by Rosberg today, but the German badly needed that to end Hamilton's momentum which had been growing race-by race. No points are handed out on Saturday though, so attention now turns towards tomorrow's race where the German will need to convert that pole to a win to really make it count. Hamilton still holds the cards in the title race, but it's far from over. Thanks for following folks, make sure you check back fro live coverage of the race tomorrow. Cheerio. 1) Nico Rosberg, 2) Lewis Hamilton, 3) Valtteri Bottas, 4) Felipe Massa, 5) Daniel Ricciardo 6) Fernando Alonso, 7) Jenson Button, 8) Kevin Magnussen, 9) Kimi Raikkonen, 10) Adrian Sutil. Well, well, well. After all the practice sessions, Hamilton looked to have the edge over Rosberg but the German has stolen a march in qualifying to beat his Mercedes team-mate to pole position by 0.376. Rosberg goes even faster by two tenths. Over to you Lewis... Here we go then, the drivers are coming out for their final qualifying runs. Mercedes are right, this is tense. I can't wait for this Q3 finale! Still Nico Rosberg has the upper hand over Lewis Hamilton by setting the fastest time so far with a 1:36.282. Hamilton is just 0.161 slower though so all to play for. Bottas, Massa, Button, Kevin Magnussen, Alonso, Ricciardo, Kimi Raikkonen and Sutil make up your top 10. The Williams of Bottas goes quickest with 1:36.906 but Rosberg is going even quicker... Daniel Ricciardo sets the first flying lap of the session and on the softer compound sets a time of 1:38.120. Over to you Lewis and Nico... ...can Hamilton turn the tables on Rosberg in the final session.? As usual it's going to be one of the Mercedes stars on pole, but which one? It's a frantic end at the bottom of the timing screens as Adrian Sutil crosses the line to reach Q3 at the expense of Perez, Hulkenberg, Kvyat and Maldonado. Sauber, without a point this year, have been given a huge boost ahead of the race. A statement of intent from Nico Rosberg who is fastest in Q2 by a massive 0.997 ahead of Hamilton with a 1:36.290. With Britain's Jenson Button just shy of third-fastest Alonso... Hamilton flat-spotted his tyres in the first session, and yet another lock-up in the second session has seen the world championship leader complain of vibrations to his team in the pit-lane. With six minutes left of Q2, Hulkenberg, Adrian Sutil, Pastor Maldonado and Sergio Perez sit in the bottom four. Advantage Nico! Rosberg goes fastest with a 1:37.099 edging out Hamilton by 0.188. Alonso is the next fastest, nearly a full second behind the Mercedes duo in his Ferrari. ...as Toro Rosso's Kvyat goes quickest on a 1:38.699 . Vettel has been eliminated from Q1 for the first time since Brazil 2009, a record run of 94 consecutive races. To put that into perspective, that was the same weekend Jenson Button clinched the world championship. Ah, the year of the Brawn... It's a bit early to take the top of the standings too seriously as Hamilton is fastest in Q1 from Felipe Massa, Bottas and Rosberg. Vergne, Gutierrez, Vettel and Romain Grosjean, who is last for Lotus, are your four going out in the first session. The soft tyre is the one to be on. Times are tumbling and Hamilton goes quickest with a 1:37.1. Vergne, Gutierrez, Vettel and Romain Grosjean your bottom four. Rosberg sets a higher bar for Hamilton as Ricciardo moves up to sixth. With three minutes to go, Esteban Gutierrez, Hulkenberg, Kvyat and Vergne are in the bottom four. Curiously, Hamilton has gone back out on the softer tyre... Vettel has to set a time to prove to stewards his car is quick enough to race, which is why despite starting from the pit-lane he is giving a go at this. As it stands with six minutes left, Nico Hulkenberg, Daniel Kvyat, John-Eric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo sit in the bottom four - the latter having not set a time yet. Rosberg goes nearly two tenths quicker than Hamilton who on his medium tyres has locked up again - this time producing a flat-spot he reports over the radio to his team. Round one to Lewis. The Brit goes half-a-tenth quicker than Rosberg despite locking up going into a corner, with the German now down to third with that pesky Williams of Valtteri Bottas splitting the Mercedes duo. Nico Rosberg is out on the harder medium tyre and sets the (very) early pace with a 1:38.8. Over to you Lewis, with Hamilton having not set a lap yet. And there is time for some more penalties as BOTH Toro Rosso drivers have been forced to change engines. Daniel Kvyat will take a 10-place grid penalty for using a new power unit, but his team-mate Jean Eric Vergne will not be penalised as he is using an old engine.. It's all smiles for Vettel in the Red Bull garage though as he and team-mate Daniel Ricciardo greet Matrix star Keanu Reeves ahead of qualifying. It's already been a terrible weekend for Sebastian Vettel, who will start from the pit-lane as a penalty having been forced to use a sixth engine this season - only five are allowed throughout the year by the FIA. The four-time world champion won in Austin last year, what a difference a year makes... 'Obviously with the agreement we signed, if numbers drop below a certain level we are obliged to run a third car to help save the sport,' Horner told Sky Sports. 'But we would prefer to see 11 two-car teams.' The plight of Caterham and Marussia hasn't gone down quietly in the F1 paddock. There are talks in the pit-lane that Sauber, Lotus and Force India may boycott tomorrow's race as a protest over the financial issues that surround the sport. Talks have taken place today involving the trio but as it stands I'd expect all three teams to line-up and fill an 18-car field tomorrow. As for the future, Bernie Ecclestone has already admitted he wouldn't be surprised to see only 14 teams on the grid next term... Jonathan McEvoy: Lewis Hamilton, who joined Simon Fuller’s management stable to fulfil his dream of fame and riches in America, has decided to take control of his own management affairs. Hamilton turned to Fuller’s XIX Entertainment group after splitting from his father Anthony after the 2009 season, but Sportsmail has learned that his contract with the company recently expired. Although neither side would comment on the development, an industry insider said: ‘Lewis is concentrating on the world championship for now and will assess how to progress with his management around New Year. Click on the above link for more. With just three races left, the F1 circus travels to Austin for just the third time since its debut in 2012. Click here for the all the facts and stats ahead of the 17th round of the championship. With two teams down, Q1 will now lose just four cars, while Q2 will also lose four drivers to leave us with the usual ten-car shoot-out in Q3. That shouldn't be any concern for the Mercedes duo, who I imagine would be devastated if they failed to even reach the front row. They are once again by far the quickest team this weekend. And Lewis Hamilton looks rather quick doesn't he heading into qualifying? In an ideal world, the talk should be centred around the title fight between Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. But with Marussia and Caterham having gone into administration before this race, the big talking points is how financially stable the sport is now we are down to just none teams. With the European season over, it's time for the three-race fly-away finale - and we start in Texas for the United States Grand Prix. Can Lewis Hamilton continue his fine form and snatch pole position from Nico Rosberg in qualifying? Follow Sportsmail's coverage of the United States Grand Prix as Britain's Lewis Hamilton attempts to snatch pole position in Austin, Texas. The Mercedes driver leads the drivers' championship ahead of team-mate and rival Nico Rosberg, and has shown strong pace for much of the weekend to be confident of starting from the front of the grid for Sunday's race. With Marussia and Caterham having not flown over for the first of the final three fly-away races, just 18 drivers will compete in the slightly adjusted session.","Nico Rosberg saw off Lewis Hamilton to pole by nearly four tenths .

"It's quite simple... if you want goals, watch Newcastle vs Liverpool on Saturday afternoon. The clash produced one of the best ever top flight games in 1996, and has provided us with the most goals of any Premier League game. A total of 129 goals in 40 games, that's 3.2 goals a game, helped by some high-scoring thrillers either side of the turn of the century. In second is Liverpool vs Tottenham, with 2.8 goals a game, Arsenal vs Tottenham, Everton vs Manchester United and Newcastle United vs Tottenham also up there. Moussa Sissoko celebrates scoring in the Capital One Cup against Manchester City on Wednesday . Mario Balotelli is yet to score in the Premier League with new club Liverpool so far . But the two sides aren't exactly firing on all cylinders. Liverpool have the joint-worst goals for record in the the top half of the table. Meanwhile, Newcastle have scored just 10 goals this term, but are enjoying a mini revival with seven points from a possible nine, but more importantly for the neutrals, have conceded 15 goals already this season. What will Saturday provide? Here's a look at five of the best clashes. Newcastle 0-6 Liverpool (2012-13) An end-of-season trouncing at St James' Park gave us a taste of what Liverpool and Daniel Sturridge would provide for us the next season. This was Luis Suarez's first suspended game after biting Branislav Ivanovic. Sturridge scored twice for the Reds, with Henderson also grabbing a brace. Striker Daniel Sturridge celebrates scoring a brace in the 6-0 win at St James' Park in April 2010 . Newcastle 3-1 Liverpool (2010-11) Alan Pardew's first game as Liverpool boss after Chris Hughton left St James' Park, and two goals in the final 10 minutes from Joey Barton and Andy Carroll sealed it against Roy Hodgson's side. He left a month later. Kenny Dalglish must have been impressed by Carroll, signing him for £35million shortly after. Andy Carroll, who moved to Liverpool shortly after, scores for Alan Pardew's new side . Newcastle 1-4 Liverpool (1998-99) A match made memorable for Michael Owen's hands. The England star, fresh from a sintilizing World Cup in France, scored a hat-trick for the Reds, his third a superb show of his electric pace by taking on two defenders. He rubbed his hands together with a cheeky grin, a celebration shown over and over since. England youngster Michael Owen was on fire in 1998, scoring a hat-trick at St James' in a 4-1 win . Liverpool 4-3 Newcastle (1996-97) The classic after the classic. Liverpool raced into a three-goal first-half lead through Steve McManaman, Patrik Berger and Robbie Fowler, but Newcastle found their way back. Striker Robbie Fowler wheels away after scoring the winner in the 1997 classic at Anfield . Three goals in 17 minutes, the third coming in the 88th minute, brought them level, but Fowler went up the other end for the winner. Heartbreak. Especially after... ... Liverpool 4-3 Newcastle (1995-96) Routinely voted the best Premier League game of all time. Newcastle were three points off Manchester United at the top with two games in hand and eight games remaining. And so it went: 1-0 Liverpool, 1-1, 2-1 Newcastle, 2-2, 3-2 Newcastle, 3-3 and then 4-3 Liverpool in the 92nd minute. Stan Collymore's thunderous strike made boss Kevin Keegan bow his head in gut-wrenching fashion. United eventually won the league, predictably. Stan Collymore wins the game for Liverpool and puts a huge dent in Newcastle's title hopes in 1996 .","Liverpool vs Newcastle has produced  total of 129 goals in 40 games .

"Dove's long-running Real Beauty campaign is being called into question by an advocate for the FTC's Truth in Advertising act, for perhaps not being so 'real' after all. Seth Matlins, a father-of-two and former high-powered advertising executive based in Los Angeles, California, has launched a petition aimed at Dove on Change.org, which has so far garnered 3,758 signatures. Although he doesn't outright accuse the beauty giant of any specific wrongdoing, Mr Matlins is asking for two 'Hero Pledges': full disclosure to its customers as to whether it has or hasn't Photoshopped its images, and the avoidance of running Photoshopped ads where kids can see them, i.e. 'billboards, bus shelters, mall kiosks, and the back covers of magazines.' Scroll down for video . Demands: Seth Matlins' petition (pictured) asks Dove to lets consumers know when it has Photoshopped an image, and if it has, to display these images only where kids can't readily see them . The petition, which is 1,241 signatures away from its goal, is accompanied by a still from Dove's own 2006 campaign; a time lapse video which sees a make-up free model styled, transformed and aggressively Photoshopped, and ends with the caption: 'No wonder our perception of beauty is distorted.' Mr Matlins' petition reads: 'As a father of two young children, I've always appreciated the idea behind Dove's Real Beauty campaign, and the brand's understanding that the way women and girls are portrayed, both literally (through words) and visually (in pictures), has a big impact on how they view themselves and who they aspire to be.' The outspoken father has an eight-year-old daughter and a seven-year-old son, and runs a blog with his wife Eva called Feel More Better, with the aim of building children's self-esteem. He argues that Photoshopped ads should be kept out of the sights of impressionable youths because 'kids don't have the ability to process or understand what they're seeing.' Practice what you preach: The petition is accompanied by a still from Dove's own 2006 campaign - a time lapse video which sees a make-up free model (right) styled, transformed and aggressively Photoshopped (left) Mr Matlins claims he is 'starting' with Dove because: 'They've been championing ‘Real Beauty’ for ten years, and because they know more about the health consequences created by the false, unrealistic representations of women and girls in Photoshopped advertising, than most.' He points to Dove's own research, which is listed on its website and states that while 72per cent of girls globally feel 'tremendous' pressure to be beautiful, only 22per cent are actually comfortable describing themselves as such. Mr Matlins hopes that Dove will lead the way in signing the Truth in Advertising Pledge and thus encouraging other advertisers to follow. 'If they don't,' he says, 'Let's ask them why not...after a decade of ""real beauty"" it seems a fair question.' 'Dove takes great care to realistically portray women by accurately depicting their natural shape, size, skin color and age' In a statement to the New York Daily News, Dove said: 'When the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty launched in 2004, we made a commitment to all women that we would not distort any of our images to create an unrealistic view of beauty. 'Dove takes great care to realistically portray women by accurately depicting their natural shape, size, skin color and age, thereby representing them as they genuinely are.' Parents: Mr Matlins (center left) has an eight-year-old daughter (left) and a seven-year-old son (right), and runs a blog with his wife Eva (center right) called Feel More Better, with the aim of building children's self-esteem . Concerns: The father said, 'Two weeks ago, my daughter [far left and far right] looks up at me as I'm putting her to bed and she says, ""Daddy, do you think I'm ugly?""' In a May interview with Fashionista, Mr Matlins opened up about why he left his 'successful' and 'lucrative' career in advertising to stand on the opposite side and campaign for stricter regulations in the very same industry. 'I left behind a pretty successful . career to do this... But if I can help my kids . and other kids grow up happier, I'll feel good' 'Two weeks ago, my daughter - apropos to nothing - looks up at me as I'm putting her to bed and she says, ""Daddy, do you think I'm ugly?""' he told the publication. 'My heart shatters into a thousand pieces, and I don't even know what to say.' He added: 'I left behind a pretty successful career to do this, and sometimes I look at the big check I didn't cash every two weeks and I think, ""That was dumb!"" But if I can help my kids and other kids grow up happier, I'll feel good.'","Seth Matlins, a father-of-two, also wants Dove to keep airbrushed images off billboards .

"Love her or loathe her, there's no denying that Kim Kardashian has flawless, envy-inducing  skin. And now, the man behind her dewy glow has revealed exactly what he uses to keep the reality TV star's skin in tip top condition. Dr Harold Lancer is the go-to dermatologist in Hollywood and the man that 33-year-old Kim credits with maintaining her youthful looks. Scroll down for video . Glow giver: Dr Harold Lancer is Hollywood's favourite dermatologist and the secret behind Kim Kardashian's flawless complexion. The skincare guru has shared his tips for getting glowing skin with MailOnline . As he launches his new book, Younger, Dr Lancer shares the skincare secrets and lifestyle tips that he passes onto his A-list clients with MailOnline. 'I prescribe the Lancer Three-Step Method - step one, polish; step two, cleanse; step three, nourish - to all of my patients, regardless of how sophisticated they are about cosmetics', he said. Dr Lancer says method differs from traditional skincare because it shifts the focus from the dermis (the lower layer of the skin) to the epidermis (the outermost layer). 'Dermis-focused skin care regimes are not effective because the ingredients, no matter how therapeutic, are not able to reach the dermis. Instead, the skin must be stimulated to repair itself,' he said. Working his magic: New mother Kim tweeted to say she feels younger every time she visits Dr Lancer in Hollywood . Skin guru: As he launches his new book, Younger, Dr Lancer shared the skincare secrets and lifestyle tips that he passes onto his A-list clients, including Jennifer Lopez, Renee Zellweger and Jessica Simpson . The Lancer Method reverses the usual order of skin care - beginning with polishing, or exfoliation, followed by cleansing, and then nourishing. He believes that by polishing first, the result is a deeper cleanse, a more efficient delivery of active ingredients and more robust cell renewal. 'Say, for example, you wanted to replace a tile floor. If your epidermis is the floor, then exfoliation is the gentle lifting process that breaks up the old, worn out tiles. Next you have to scoop up and sweep away the debris, e.g. cleansing, and finally fresh tiles have to be laid, which represent the nourish step,' he said. 'Exfoliation creates a ""controlled injury"",' he explains. 'Gentle exfoliation sends a message to the dermis that repair should begin and fresh cells are needed, expediting the turnover of cells in your epidermis. 'The controlled injury achieved by exfoliating turns back the clock by re-energising the repair process, giving skin a younger, fresher look.' Famous fan: Victoria, 40, is a huge fan of Lancer Lift Serum Intense, which is described as 'an elegant serum that utlises plant stem cell technology to speed up cellular regeneration' The next step is cleansing, which, as most people know, helps you get rid of everything that you have loosened up by exfoliating. This is followed by nourish, which delivers anti-oxidants, vitamins and other anti-ageing ingredients to the skin. Kim is an everyday user of Dr Lancer’s three step Method, as is Victoria Beckham, who also loves his SPF and the Lift Serum Intense. Victoria, . 40, uses the serum, which is described as .

"Now that September is in full swing, I thought it was about time for a serious skincare shuffle. Although I do stay loyal to certain skincare products, being the beauty junkie I am means it’s difficult not to be tempted by the plethora of new releases. The long, sun-soaked days of the summer months have left my skin feeling a little dry and lacklustre, so I thought I'd revitalise it by testing out a few new skincare choices - here are some of my top picks: . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Revamp: Binky gives her beauty routine a rejig this week as she prepares for autumn . BINKY'S AUTUMN SKINCARE PICKS . DHC Platinum Silver Nanocolloid Cream . This platinum infused moisturiser leaves my skin feeling gloriously smooth and hydrated. It's particularly suited to those whose skin is just starting to show the first signs of ageing, as it contains anti-oxidant rich olive oil and firming olive leaf extract to combat fine lines and uneven skin texture. As Mummy Felstead always reminds me, the key to youthful looking skin in your older years is to start early – prevention is better than cure! REN Glycolactic Radiance Renewal Mask . This weekly mask transforms dreary, tired-looking skin in an instant (well, 10 minutes!). Made up of a combination of nutritious fruit acids, the powerful formula removes dead skin cells, reduces blemishes and smooths the skin's surface, leaving you with a significantly brighter, more radiant complexion. The zesty citrus scent and slight tingling effect on the skin make the mask a real pleasure to use, too. La Roche-Posay Pigmentclar Eyes . I've had a few late nights with filming recently, and so have been reaching for this super-effective dark circle corrector to brighten and soothe my tired peepers. Pigmentclar Eyes blends a high concentration of caffeine with light-reflecting pigments to banish dark circles and illuminate the eye area, and its gentle texture makes it suitable for the delicate under eye region, providing an instant cooling effect once applied. Perfect timing: Binky says autumn is a great opportunity to refresh your skin after the dry summer months . Eucerin DermatoCLEAN Micellar Cleansing Fluid . After seeing lots of fellow bloggers rave about this micellar cleanser, I thought I'd try it out. Similarly to my favourite Bioderma Sensbio H2O, this Eucerin fluid feels ultra-light on the skin without leaving an oily residue. As it's made up of purely natural ingredients, it's perfect for easily irritated skin and removes mascara like a dream when applied with a cotton pad. Plus it's a toner as well as a cleanser and make-up remover – 3 skincare steps in one product makes it a definite winner in my eyes. Skinbreeze Blemish Fix . Let's face it, we all suffer from bad skin days, whether it's redness and blemishes or a spot that just won't budge. I always rely on the fast-acting Skinbreeze Blemish Fix to stop spots in their tracks – it contains salicylic and hyaluronic acids to quickly tackle breakouts, blemishes and redness. As well as this, it's infused with seaweed extract to leave skin feeling soothed and nourished. All of Binky's top picks are available at available at Escentual.com now. New style: In addition to rebooting her skincare routine Binky tries out Hollywood waves this week . BINKY'S HOW TO: HOLLYWOOD WAVES . I also thought I'd show you a quick hair tutorial this week – my friend Emily helped me create this gorgeous sleek wavy do for a night out recently. I've been loving rocking this glamorous Hollywood-style look both day and night as an alternative to my usual more messy boho style. Here’s how to do it: . After applying a heat protection product such as Bumble and Bumble Heat/UV Protective Primer, brush your hair throroughly to untangle any knots and ensure a smooth, sleek curl. Clip the majority of your hair up to the top of your head, leaving roughly an inch of hair around the whole head at the bottom to start with. Using a medium-sized pair of tongs like Babyliss Volume Waves, take a small section of hair and lightly wrap it around the tong, holding in place for a few seconds. Ensure the hair is wrapped flat around the tongs for a smooth finish. Voila! Binky recommends using a heat treatment spray to keep curls looking sleek . For a Hollywood-style sleek, glamorous look, curl each section of hair in the same direction and keep the sections of hair being curled of equal size. Repeat the process across your whole head of hair by taking down further sections until you reach the top. When you reach the crown, use the tongs to curl the last sections of hair in the opposite direction to the rest of the curls to give the style some body and avoid looking like a poodle! Once you’ve curled all of your hair, give the finished look some serious volume by backcombing the top half of your hair, working a comb gently upwards to create body near the crown. Don’t worry if your hair starts looking a bit crazy, as it can easily be smoothed out! Finally, use a bristly brush to sleek out your backcombed barnet, and hold the style in place with a long-lasting hairspray such as Bumble + Bumble Spray de Mode. Et voila! A sleek Hollywood-style barnet without having to set foot into the salon. Stay gorgeous, . Binky xxx .","As the summer comes to an end, Binky revamps her skincare .

"What is your wildest desire? I have one of those dreams — the most exotic, unattainable yearning I can imagine. But it isn’t winning the lottery, or something that would belong in the pages of 50 Shades Of Grey. Rather, my ultimate outrageous daydream is . . . to have normal hair. Not marvellous hair. Not even Kim-Sears-meets-Cheryl-Cole hair. Just something that resembles the stuff regular people have on their head. Scroll down for video . Beyond frizzy: Kate has always longed for normal hair that doesn't have to be tamed into submission . Other women wash their hair, leave it to dry, and do not look as if they have had an encounter with an electric storm. They can go swimming, then walk around as their hair dries into shiny, swingy shape. But not me. Left to dry naturally, my hair is beyond frizzy. It is a trichological freak of nature I’ve been putting up with for 50 years. My life is ruled by the tyranny of bludgeoning it into submission. Any scheduled hair wash must allow 30 to 40 minutes for blow-drying and straightening irons, if I am to achieve the height of my styling ambitions — to look like other women. Even non-washing days require a minimum ten minutes to wrestle it into normality. But the tyranny doesn’t end there. Any form of damp weather, humidity or drizzle sees my newly-straightened hair return to a frizzy mass within 60 seconds. Volumising treatment: Kate undergoes the new, British blow-dry which has been devised by London hairdresser Edward James to suit women with finer hair . I’ve often considered having a Brazilian blow-dry — a smoothing and straightening treatment in which the protein keratin is ironed into the hair — but it can cost up to £500 every three months, requires at least four hours in the salon, and is so full of formaldehyde that Jennifer Aniston was forced to slice her famous locks to chin-length after treatments ruined her hair. Brazilian blow-dries can also leave hair lank, stripping hair like mine of its one redeeming quality — volume. But now, salvation has emerged. The new, British blow-dry has been devised by London hairdresser Edward James to suit those of us with finer hair. The formula costs £100, takes 15 minutes to apply, contains no formaldehyde and promises specifically to preserve volume. Fast frizz-banishment: The formula costs £100, takes 15 minutes to apply, contains no formaldehyde and promises specifically to preserve volume . Rather than covering the whole head in straightening solution, as with a Brazilian treatment, it is painted only on to the frizziest parts (the ends), avoiding roots, except right at the crown. What’s more, you don’t need to leave hair for several days after the treatment before washing it, as with the Brazilian version — 24 hours is all that’s required. And, instead of avoiding any shampoo that contains sulphate afterwards (as you must with the Brazilian) any type is fine. I couldn’t get to Edward’s salon in South-West London fast enough. ‘Your hair isn’t actually super frizzy,’ Edward claimed, as I settled into a chair. ‘The frizziest part is at the top of your crown, but that’s quite common.’ The treatment was preceded with an ammonia-free glossing oil to add shine and moisture. In ten minutes, it was worked from root to tip, then left for another ten, before being shampooed away. Now for Edward’s formula. Confidence boost: The treatment leaves the hair feeling very conditioned and creates a smooth, shiny finish . ‘I’m applying smoothing keratin protein, specifically where the hair is more unmanageable,’ he said, as he ran what looked like a tiny paintbrush through varying lengths of my hair. ‘Keratin is one of the key constituents of the hair shaft. This treatment is designed to strengthen and smooth the hair and make it feel more moisturised and manageable.’ It sounded like the usual blurb you hear about lots of hair products. fifteen minutes later, Edward began blow-drying, and the difference was unmistakeable. It was the feel of my hair which, at this stage, was most noticeably different. It was unbelievably silky. ‘The treatment leaves the hair feeling very conditioned,’ said Edward. ‘It will not remove curl, but will create a smooth, shiny finish with body at the roots. ‘It is perfect for hair that reacts to humidity, and is suitable for most hair types. Some Brazilian blow-dries alter the shade of coloured hair, but the British blow-dry helps condition it.’ Four days later: Kate is delighted by the results of her British blow-dry and no longer needs straighteners . Just over an hour after entering the salon, I was done. Running my hands through my hair felt wonderfully unfamiliar, and the way it bounced as I walked was a huge confidence boost. The first test was to drive the 30 miles home with my car roof down. Before, I always had to tie my hair back; otherwise, the buffeting snarled it into knots. This time, there was not one tangle; it simply fell back into place. When I woke the next day, I ran to the mirror — and feared the spell had been broken when I saw my hair had gone flat either side of my head. But ten seconds with a brush saw the shape restored. Later, I got caught in a downpour; usually a recipe for disaster. Not now. I ran my fingers through my hair and it was straight again. Then, the next day, the ultimate test: I washed it, having set aside the usual 40 minutes to blow-dry it. But after 15 minutes, there was nothing left to do. I didn’t even need my straightening irons. This is life-altering stuff. Now, a new affliction has set in: a manic compulsion to keep touching the silky softness atop my head. And if that provokes stares, I don’t care. I finally have great hair.","Kate Battersby's life has been ruled by her frizzy hair for 50 years .

"London Fashion Week has been and gone in a flash, and my main focus has of course been on the beauty trends. From bold brights at Burberry and glossy minimalism at Christopher Kane to the downright kooky pastel-painted brows at Badgley Mischka, I can safely say I'm now stocked up on some serious beauty as well as fashion inspiration. One of my favourite beauty looks from the SS15 shows came from Marchesa, who sent their models down the catwalk in floaty festival florals, led by the gorgeous Georgia May Jagger. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This week Binky has been recreating her favourite looks from London Fashion Week . The make-up at Marchesa combined fresh, flawless skin with Bardot-esque lined eyes, blending inspiration from both the sleek and glossy look of Keira Knightley and the Duchess of Cambridge and the carefree, rock-chick style of It-girls Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne. Lucy, Spencer and I appeared on a special edition of The Million Pound Drop last week, where I went for a very similar beauty look featuring a 60s style eye and peachy lip. It's a timeless look that's both wearable and bang on trend - here's how to get it: . Binky took inspiration from the Marchesa SS15 show that saw Georgia May Jagger take to the runway . GET THE LOOK . THE BASE . First, create a velvety-smooth base by spritzing a layer of DiorSkin Airflash Spray Foundation onto your face and buffing in with a foundation brush. The super-light, silky formulation airbrushes away blemishes whilst giving the complexion a radiant glow for a flawless, catwalk-ready finish. Binky says that it is important to get a velvety smooth base to create a soft natural look . Binky has opted for soft peachy tones for a subtle spring time look . THE EYES . Start by applying a neutral taupe or beige shadow like Daniel Sandler Matte Shadow Compact in Cedar. Use a fluffy brush to blend the shadow all over your eyelids, to subtly define your socket line and disguise any discolouration on the lid. Next, for a sleek and streamlined eye, flick a liquid liner like DHC Liquid Eyeliner EX across your upper lash line. Follow up with generous lashings of Too Faced Better Than Sex Mascara on your top and bottom lashes. Add a touch of nonchalant rock-chick definition to your lower lash line by wiggling the brush over the lash right from the root. Binky's make-up this week is made up of peachy tones so can be worn during the day . Backstage at Marchesa where feminine florals took centre stage . Gently fill in your brows with the Clarins Eyebrow Pencil, warming the nib with your fingers so the colour looks soft and natural. Use the handy brush on the other end of the pencil to blend the colour into your brows, brushing in light upward strokes for a fashion-forward, full finish. THE CONTOUR . Brush a slight dusting of Caudalie Mineral Bronzing Powder just under the cheekbones to add some some warmth and definition to your face. For a subtly radiant glow, sweep a touch of Too Faced Absolutely Invisible Candlelight Highlighter across the tops of your cheekbones. Binky's calender is released in just a few weeks and apparently much of it involves shots of the reality star in her underwear . THE LIPS . Finally, add a pretty pop of coral-pink colour to your lips with Dior Rouge Trianon Edition Couture Colour Lipstick in Rose Crinoline. Use a lip brush to apply the colour in a light, sheer layer, giving your pout a natural flush. To fake a Jagger-style full pout, dab a slick of Vaseline on to the centre of your lips. I also wanted to tell you some exciting news – my 2015 calendar is going to be released in just a few short weeks! I've been finalising the images for each month, and I can reveal that quite a few more pics of me in my favourite lingerie by Bluebella made the cut. Stay beautiful, .

The researchers analysed information gathered by infrared and electromagnetic motion capture systems which documented how 10 couples moved when attempting five common positions. They then created a set of guidelines that recommended different positions and 'thrusting techniques' based on what triggered a man's back pain. The findings, published in the journal Spine, included a recommendation for men who were flexion-intolerant - meaning those whose back pain was made worse by touching their toes or sitting for long periods of time - who should replace spooning with doggy-style sex. They should also try a 'hip-hinging motion rather than thrusting with their spines', the authors said. Researchers said back pain could leave some couples to be celibate . Lead author Natalie Sidorkewicz said: 'Before now, spooning was often recommended by physicians as the one position that fit all. 'But as we've discovered, that is not the case. 'Sex positions that are suitable for one type of back pain aren't appropriate for another kind of pain. 'For the first time ever, we now have very solid science to guide clinicians on their recommendations for patients who suffer debilitating back pain, but still want to be intimate. 'This has the potential to improve quality of life - and love-life - for many couples.' Professor Stuart McGill, of the University's faculty of applied health sciences, added: 'Any family doctor will tell you that couples often ask them how to manage their back pain during and after sex. 'Many couples will remain celibate because one night of love-making can lead to months of back agony. 'Until now, doctors have never had any hard science to base their recommendations upon.' The researchers plan to publish details about what happens to the female spine in coming months.","Scientists at the University of Waterloo in Ontario found men with back ache should opt to have sex 'doggy-style'

"After Apple announced the super-thin iPad Air, it was only a matter of time before the firm was able to produce a streamlined phone to match. During last night’s event, Apple was keen to promote this fact, by showing off how much thinner its latest iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets are compared to previous models. So keen, in fact, they appear to have used a bit of photo trickery to make the devices even narrower than they actually are. Scroll down for video . Slimline tonic: The iPhone 6 (centre) is 6.9mm thick, and the iPhone 6 Plus (pictured right) is 7.1mm. By comparison, the iPhone 5S (left) is 7.6mm. During the presentation, when the devices were shown on the big screen they appeared thinner than they really are. The outer line shows the actual thickness, the inner line shows how they appear . The illusion was first spotted by digital news website Quartz. The iPhone 6 is 6.9mm thick, while the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1mm. By comparison, the iPhone 5S is 7.6mm, and the 5C is 8.97mm. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.1mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches 5.75mm. By comparison, Apple's iPhone 6 is 6.9mm thick, and the iPhone 6 Plus is 7.1mm. The current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 8.1mm thick, and the HTC One M8 is 9.4mm. This means the iPhone 6 is 9.2 per cent thinner than the iPhone 5S, and the iPhone 6 Plus is 7 per cent more slender. However, during last night's presentation, the devices were shown on a screen that made them appear even smaller than this. This was achieved by lighting the side of the phones straight on, and creating shadows on the curved edges. These shadows then blended into the background of the slide, making the phones both look approximately 5mm in width. If this was the accurate width, it would make the devices 34.2 per cent and 29.5 per cent thinner than the 5S.

"When it comes to those big nights out, less is definitely not more. You need to turn up the volume (not just on your hair) but on your whole look so you can stand out from the crowd. Last week I had a big red-carpet event that I was attending with Made In Chelsea colleague Rosie Fortescue, so we both popped down to Duck & Dry, the recently launched Kings Road hair salon that specialise in blow-drys and up-dos. For big night hair, getting someone else to do your blow-dry really helps to nail your look. Most salons will happily do this for around £15-£20, but if you are working to a budget call a friend and get ready together. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky opted for classic Hollywood glamour for her beauty look . I went for cascading volumous curls – bigger the better. My hair was dried gently including the roots by Duck & Dry Creative Director Snowden Hill and he used O&M Rootilicious Root Lift, but I’ve not seen this product on-sale in shops, so my choice for home would be Schwarzkopf Professional Osis + Blow and Go Thick Spray. Massage this into the roots to give lift and volume, and tease in a good styling mousse for the main body of your hair that adds body – one of my favourites is Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Holding Foam. Snowden then blow-dried my hair with a large round brush (remember be careful not to damage your hair with too much heat) and then put it in large Velcro curlers in sections for about 15 minutes. Binky was joined by her pals Louise Thompson (centre) and Rosie Fortescue (right) Binky rocked a £500,000 ring and £50,000 bracelet to ensure she was looking red carpet chic . He then used heated tongs on all sections, and back-combed, starting from the nape of the neck, sides and then into the sides and finally the top sections and then smoothed and styled. I normally use Sexy Hair – Big Sexy Hair Spray and Play, it does what is says on the tine and has super firm hold that lasts all night. Rosie had curlers on the top section to give lift but then had the side sections blow-dried tight to the sides and back, and back-combed sections at the bottom by the nape of the neck to give lift at the back. It was a really sleek look and it requires quite a bit of Schwarzkopf Professional BC Bonacure Oil Miracle Divine Polish Shine Spray which created a glossy finish which had a real cutting-edge catwalk feel. Binky had her hair styled at the Duck & Dry on the Kings Road . For my night out I was also lucky enough to have jeweller to the stars Vashi Dominguez – owner of top diamond retailer Vashi.com – lend me some beautiful jewellery for the occasion. He adorned me with a pair of sophisticated 15 carat drop chandelier diamond earrings worth £50,000, a dainty 25 carat diamond tennis bracelet worth £80,000 and a massive 60 carat Burmese sapphire diamond ring worth a whopping £500,000! The stunning Vashi.com jewellery complemented my outfit perfectly and made me feel like a million dollars (quite literally!). Binky says it's important to opt for a high quality lipstick in order to prevent bleeding and fade . Clearly I can’t afford to keep these jewels and on most occasions I wear some statement costume jewellery to add a bit of bling to the finished look. Now on to the make-up.

Poor quality lip products can fade, slide or bleed mere minutes after you’ve applied them. This Clarins lip colour, however, really lasts, without drying out your pout like some long-hold lipsticks can. The formula boasts botanical waxes to nourish, pearl polymers to give intense colour and hold, and plant oils for shine and moisture. I chose a soft raspberry shade called Tea Rose, and it kept my lips looking kissable right through to the final “mwah”! Narciso Rodriguez Narciso Eau de Parfum Spray: .

"Around 66 million years ago, a six mile-wide (10km) asteroid smashed into the Earth off Mexico's Yucatan peninsular. The impact wiped out three quarters of all plant and animal species - including the dinosaurs - triggering mega-tsunami, wildfires, global earthquakes. But even Armageddon can have a silver lining, according to a new discovery which claims the event proved a turning point for the plants that now dominate vegetation on Earth. After the impact, fast-growing seasonal species of plants began to take over from evergreens. This is according to a study of 1,000 fossilised plant leaves in North Dakota by the University of Arizona . After the impact, fast-growing seasonal species of plants rapidly began to take over from evergreens. 'If you think about a mass extinction caused by catastrophic event such as a meteorite impacting Earth, you might imagine all species are equally likely to die,' said lead scientist Dr Benjamin Blonder, from the University of Arizona. 'Survival of the fittest doesn't apply - the impact is like a reset button. 'The alternative hypothesis, however, is that some species had properties that enabled them to survive. Analysis of the leaf samples revealed the switch from evergreens to deciduous plants after the meteor struck . All the fossils were collected from a rock formation known as Hell Creek that marks the site of an ancient flood plain in the south of North Dakota . Dr Blonder's study provides evidence of a dramatic shift from slow-growing plants to fast-growing species. He said it potentially tells scientists why modern forests are generally made up of seasonal plants and not evergreen. A devastating 'impact winter', brought on by an asteroid strike 66 million years ago, is being blamed for wiping out the dinosaurs. Researchers have discovered the first physical evidence that global temperatures suddenly plummeted following the impact off Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Its effects would have been identical to those seen in the aftermath of a large-scale nuclear war, including the chilling effect of dust blotting out of the sun. According to the research, the 'Chicxulub' impact is likely to have brought about this 'nuclear winter' by lowering global sea surface temperatures by as much as 7°C (45°F) at a conservative estimate. For creatures evolved to live in a lush, warm, green world, the result would have been catastrophic. The 'winter' is thought to have lasted no more than two to three decades, but that was long enough to wipe out the dinosaurs, flying and swimming reptiles, and many other forms of life. Only the most adaptable survived, leading to the reign of the birds and mammals that continues to this day. Deciduous plants, which grow fast and lose their leaves at some point during the year, were better able to survive the changing conditions of an impact winter, the researchers believe. Evergreen plants, such as holly, tend to have leaves that are costly to construct but robust and long-lasting. Leaves of deciduous plants are short lived and more cheaply built, but easier to replace. 'There is a spectrum between fast and slow-growing species,' said Dr Blonder. 'There is the 'live fast, die young' strategy and there is the ""slow but steady"" strategy.' The discovery, reported in the online journal Public Library of Science Biology, followed a study of around 1,000 fossilised plant leaves dating back to a 2.2 million-year period spanning the impact event. All the fossils were collected from a rock formation known as Hell Creek that marks the site of an ancient flood plain in the south of North Dakota. Analysis of the leaf samples revealed the switch from evergreens to deciduous plants after the meteor struck. 'We measured the mass of a given leaf in relation to its area, which tells us whether the leaf was a chunky, expensive one to make for the plant, or whether it was a more flimsy, cheap one,' said Dr Blonder. 'In other words, how much carbon the plant had invested in the leaf.' The scientists also measured the density of the leaves' vein networks, which gave a clue to their transpiration rate - the speed at which they drew water. '[The study] tells us that the extinction was not random, and the way in which a plant acquires resources predicts how it can respond to a major disturbance,' said Dr Blonder.

"Preparing the garden for winter is something we all have to do - usually as a reluctant activity one Sunday afternoon - but for workers at Britain's oldest and largest topiary it is a mammoth six-month job. By this time of year the usually perfectly sculpted shapes of the trees and bushes at Levens Hall in the Lake District are starting to look a little fuzzy round the edges. And it takes a team of four men and their shears until February to complete the ten-acre garden's annual haircut. Time for a snip: The ten acres of topiary gardens at Levens Hall in the Lake District require a six-month tidy up every autumn to keep them looking perfect . Getting to work: Head gardener Chris Crowder, 52, has worked at the gardens for 27 years and lives in the house that was built for the first head gardener 300 years ago . All shapes and sizes: Levens Hall houses Britain's oldest and largest topiary gardens, as most were town down in the 1730s after going out of fashion . Head Gardener at the topiary, Chris Crowder, said: 'It is certainly a big job. We usually kick off around now, and then hope to finish by Christmas, although the snow can hold us back - and it's usually February when we finally put down our shears. 'By late August the bushes and trees are starting to look untidy, but you have to be careful not to start clipping too early. If you do that then you are in danger of having to do the mammoth job twice a year.' The topiary at Levens Hall, which dates back to the 17th century, is unique as it is the only one which has survived the shifting fashion in gardening. Snow problem: The team of four gardeners hopes to be finished by Christmas, but snowy weather can often hamper their efforts and take the project into February . Gardening heights: The gardeners use many of the same methods utilised back in the 17th century, though hydraulic lifts are often used instead of ladders . Stroke of luck: It is only by chance that this topiary survives, as the family which owned Levens Hall had a second home which they were more fashion-conscious about, and therefore did not mind this garden falling behind in terms of style . The first seeds were sown in the 1690s - a time Mr Crowder, 52, describes as the golden age of topiary gardens. But not long after, in the 1730s, landscaping became more popular and many of the gardens were ripped out. Mr Crowder, who lives within the grounds of Levens Hall in a house that was built for the very first head gardener more than 300 years ago, added: 'The reason why this topiary has remained was partly due to the fact that the family had a second house. 'They were more fashion conscious when it came to that home, and the topiary at Levens was allowed to remain. It was a much-loved garden by the family, and a quirk of chance has meant it remained.' The garden was started by Frenchman Guillaume Beaumont when the house was sold to Colonel James Grahme - Keeper of the Privy Purse to King James II. The way in which the garden is maintained has changed little in its 324-year history. Variety: The shapes are made from small-leaved evergreens Yew Taxus baccata, Golden Yew Taxus baccata 'Aurea' and various forms of Box Buxus sempervirens . Timing is key: It is important the gardeners do not start work on the topiary too early, otherwise it will need to be trimmed twice the following year . Shears and clippers are still used to trim the trees into shape, although a hydraulic lift has replaced the ladders that were once needed to reach the tops of the highest. Mr Crowder, who has worked at the topiary for 27 years, said: 'One of the things that is so special about this job is the continuity. The tidying up of the topiary has taken place every single year for the past 300 years. 'It makes you feel connected to the gardeners of the past. The topiary is much the same as it always has been, it is mainly the flowers underneath the trees that change. 'The way in which visitors enter the garden is quite unusual, through a small side door. 'This then opens up into an amazing and magical scene. I am lucky enough to work here every day, but for visitors, it is a spectacular sight.' The shapes in the topiary are made from tight-growing, small-leaved evergreens Yew Taxus baccata, Golden Yew Taxus baccata 'Aurea' and various forms of Box Buxus sempervirens. The garden at Levens Hall is open to public between April and October. It closes this year on October 9.","Levens Hall in the Lake District undergoes mammoth trim at the end of every summer to prepare for winter .

"Despite previous claims, contaminated groundwater found in areas of Pennsylvania and Texas was not caused by controversial fracking drills. Instead, the tainted water supplies are being blamed on problems in pipes and seals in nearby natural gas wells. Experts focused on eight hydraulically fractured wells in both states, and used chemical analysis to determine when in the process of gas extraction methane leaked into groundwater. Researchers claim the drilling procedure called fracking didn't cause water in Texas and Pennsylvania to become contaminated. Instead, they blamed the methane levels on leaky wells. Fracking operations at a wellpad overlying the Marcellus Formation in Pennsylvania pictured . 'We found the evidence suggested that fracking was not to blame, that it was actually a well integrity issue,' said Ohio State University geochemist Thomas Darrah, lead author of the study. He added those results are good news because this type of contamination problem is easier to fix and is more preventable than the damage caused by fracking. In fracking, highly pressurised chemicals and water are pumped deep underground to break shale and release natural gas for harvesting. Experts focused on eight hydraulically fractured wells in Pennsylvania and Texas. They reached their conclusions by chemically analysing methane and other chemicals in the groundwater. That let them link the contamination to particular wells, and then to discover what part of the drilling process was responsible. For example, they studied the precise proportions of methane, helium, neon and argon. Those proportions pointed to leaky pipes and seals, because the results would have been different if the contamination had come from fracking. Earlier this year, residents began accusing the fracking process for the contamination, claiming the fracturing allowed methane to travel up, outside the pipes, into water supplies. In at least two cases around a well in Texas, scientists saw methane levels in people's home jump ten-fold during the year of study. 'I don't think homeowners care what step in the process the water contamination comes,' Stanford University environmental sciences professor Rob Jackson said. 'They just care that their lives have changed because drilling has moved next door.' Since the fracking began in Pennsylvania in 2008, the state has identified 243 cases of private water supply contamination 'impacted by oil and gas activities' - out of more than 20,000 wells drilled in the region. Jackson and colleagues have been studying water contamination around natural gas wells for years, but rather than choosing random samples for this particular study, his team aimed their research at areas with the most contamination complaints. And even in those areas, it was only in a minority of dozens of sites that they could they connect the contamination to the natural gas wells, he said. Experts reached their conclusions by chemically analysing methane and other chemicals in the groundwater in Texas (pictured) and Pennsylvania. They could then link the contamination to particular wells, and then to discover what part of the drilling process was responsible . This graphic reveals how gas is extracted from the ground using fracking techniques . In some cases, the contamination was natural and had no connection to gas wells, Jackson said. Terry Engelder, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University who wasn't part of the study, praised it, saying 'focusing on frack fluids at depth is not the real problem.' It is possible the high pressure of fracking or the bends in unconventional wells could lead to problems with the well's piping, but there's no evidence yet proving that, Jackson added. Another issue could be the hurry drillers are in during a boom, leading to poor quality wells, he said. Dave Spigelmyer, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition of drillers, said his industry is working with state officials 'to modernize and dramatically strengthen shale development-related regulations.' Cornell University engineering professor Anthony Ingraffea, who wasn't part of the study, praised it, adding that he's worried because 'it's impossible to drill and cement a well that will never leak.' 'There's still serious and signiicant harm from what's coming before fracking and what's coming after fracking,' Ingraffea said. The findings were published in the  The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal.","Experts focused on eight fractured wells in Pennsylvania and Texas .

"An arm wrestling game is the first gaming app announced for the Apple Watch (pictured) that was unveiled last night and will go on sale in Spring . With its cutting-edge design, sapphire glass screen and array of functions, you may imagine that the first game to appear on the Apple Watch would be futuristic. But it is in fact an arm wrestling game designed by a small indie games developer in Fullerton, California. The title is called iArm Wrestle Champs and is made for the Apple Watch as well as rival Android wearables. The game will enable the wearer of the Apple Watch to arm wrestle another person, while the app provides commentary, Kotaku reported. The' accelerometer' in the watch enables it to detect tilting and ultimately who will win the arm wrestling battle. Players will be able to customise their watch with a picture for the game, record voice clips and more. A version for iOS and Android smartphones is already available. As the Apple Watch will go on sale in spring 2015, it seems likely that a variety of games will be developed in time for the launch, to give gamers an alternative to arm wrestling. It is likely that such games will rely on a user rotating the 'crown' button the side of the device, shouting voice commands or even controlling their heartbeat, instead of trying to tap items on the watch's small screen. Apple unveiled its rectangular Apple Watch last night along with two iPhone 6 handsets and a new mobile payment system called Apple Pay. Numerous features were demonstrated on the new wearable, but there was no mention of gaming at the launch, other than that app developers would be able to create apps for the device.

It is likely that such games will rely on a user rotating the 'crown' button the side of the device, shouting voice commands or even controlling their heartbeat, instead of trying to tap items on the watch's small screen. 'A bit like Apple’s phones and tablets, the watch has an elegance and luxuriousness which has eluded the efforts of other manufacturers. 'Apple seems to have understood that, like jewellery, watches are highly personal. A choice of sizes, finishes and straps will no doubt convince people that a smart watch is worth investing in. 'However, the fact that users will also need an iPhone with their watch, and it's therefore not a standalone gadget, was glossed over fairly rapidly.'

"MitoQ claims to be 847 times more effective than other antioxidants at replenishing skin . So called ‘miracle’ anti-ageing products and creams are ten a penny these days and promise various extreme results using a variety of weird and wonderful ingredients. However, the science behind such products is often extremely dubious, with some claims boarding on ludicrous. Now another 'fountain of youth' has hit the market – this time in the form of both a supplement and a cream - and appears to have some fairly impressive evidence backing up its promise to slow down the ageing process. In fact the targeted antioxidant, MitoQ claims to be 847 times more effective than other antioxidants at replenishing skin, reducing wrinkles, as well as restoring energy levels and fighting fatigue and promoting optimal organ health. MitoQ was discovered by scientists working on treatments for liver disease at Otago University in New Zealand and after over a decade of research, MitoQ dietary supplement capsules have now been launched in the UK. It is said to work by targeting the mitochondria (the ‘batteries’ in the body’s cells), helping to restore the damaging free radicals that accumulate there and in turn slow down the ageing process as it is these free radicals that cause skin to age and can even lead to a variety of diseases. MitoQ’s active ingredient is Q, a powerful form of antioxidant and the active component of the body’s own organic antioxidant system CoQ. Skin starts to age from when a person reaches 20, because the body’s ability to defend cells deteriorates over time and that’s when the harmful free radicals overwhelm the body. MitoQ claims to work against this process by replenishing and supporting the body’s antioxidants, which help protect against free radicals and therefore lessen the damage to skin cells. Recent clinical trials in the US have found that it enters the mitochondria quickly, maintaining or even boosting energy levels. It is reported that MitoQ has helped with the debilitating symptoms of ME and CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome). Testing is continuing. Skin starts to age from when a person reaches 20, because the body's cellular defence systems deteriorate over time . However, not everyone is convinced that MitoQ, whatever its medical uses, will make any difference to the visible signs of ageing. Beauty expert Elsa McAlonan says: 'It has long been acknowledged that antioxidants in skincare, or taken internally in tablets or in our daily diets, can help improve our health and can show in the condition of our skin. 'There are many skincare products that are 'packed with antioxidants' already, so there is nothing ground-breaking about this - it seems to me to be another ploy to get us to part with money. 'Any skincare expert will tell you that the best way to hold back the years is to stay out of the sun, drink plenty of water and use a good balanced skincare routine. Diet is keyand many world famous skin doctors, like Dr Howard Murad and Dr Nicholas Perricone, have always championed the importance of a sensible diet with plenty of antioxidants and have very successful skincare ranges to target a multitude of issues, especially anti-ageing.'","MitoQ discovered by scientists researching liver disease .

"It may make navigating using plain old Google Maps seem a little boring. A Washington designer has created an online map of the world designed to make Earth look like the Death Star from the hit film Star Wars. Oceans appear as regions of deep space, and major cities have been renamed 'colonies' Use your mouse to zoom around the map . The map uses a 'skin' on top of an open source map of the world to turn Earth into a sci-fi film . The map was created using an open source map called OpenStreetMap.

'I’m a big fan of science fiction and computer games, so I couldn’t resist making a space themed map, said Eleanor Lutz . 'I crammed it full of bright lights and chrome like some of my favorite post-apocalyptic worlds: the Matrix, Battlestar Galactica, and Starcraft.' Lutz also tweaked the map to make it more sci-fi, by making markers larger and even renaming major cities like New York and London to 'colonies.' 'My favorite part about making this map was adding oversized markers for stores, parks, and other points of interest to simulate city lights. 'I lowered the contrast for landmasses and buildings to highlight the lights and the galaxy ‘ocean’. 'I took advantage of TileMill’s extensive text customization to change the names of all major cities into space colonies. The Palms and the world resort in dubai are clearly visible in the 'Dubai Colony' area of the map.

"Computer-driven cars have been testing their skills on California roads for more than four years — but until now, the Department of Motor Vehicles wasn't sure just how many were rolling around. Now, the state has issued the first permits. The tough new rules mean Google has also been forced to adapt its driverless car concept, adding a steering wheel. The tough new rules mean Google has also been forced to adapt its driverless car concept, adding a steering wheel to allow it to be used on California roads . The temporary wheel Google has fitted to the car . Google's souped-up Lexus SUVs are the biggest fleet, with 25 vehicles. Mercedes and Volkswagen have two vehicles each, said Bernard Soriano, the DMV official overseeing the state's 'autonomous vehicle' regulation-writing process. A 'handful' of other companies are applying for permits, he said. 'We knew that California law would require any vehicles still being tested to have manual controls, so we’ve had a plan read,' the firm said. 'After each vehicle is assembled, we fit a temporary steering wheel and set of controls into it. 'We’ll remove these manual controls after the prototypes have finished being tested and permitted, because our vehicles are ultimately designed to operate without a human driver.' Google also revealed it plans to use the vast aircraft hanger is leased from Nasa as a test facility. Testing of cars without drivers could begin at early next year, according to a statement from Ames associate director Deborah Feng. Nasa is working with Google on the project and hopes to gain useful information for its own efforts to develop unmanned drones and systems. The agency issued testing permits that allowed three companies to dispatch 29 vehicles onto freeways and into neighborhoods — with a human behind the wheel in case the onboard computers make a bad decision. For the first time, California's Department of Motor Vehicles knows how many self-driving cars are traveling on the state's public roads. These may be the cars of the future, but for now they represent a tiny fraction of California's approximately 32 million registered vehicles. Google's souped-up Lexus SUVs are the biggest fleet, with 25 vehicles. Mercedes and Volkswagen have two vehicles each, said Bernard Soriano, the DMV official overseeing the state's 'autonomous vehicle' regulation-writing process. A 'handful' of other companies are applying for permits, he said. The permits formally regulate testing that already was underway. Google alone is closing in on 1 million miles. The technology giant has bet heavily on the vehicles, which navigate using sophisticated sensors and detailed maps. Google will work with Nasa to test the cars at the Ames researcher center, where it recently leased this hangar from the space agency. Hangar One was built in 1933 to house U.S. Navy blimps after World War I, including USS Macon, pictured. Finally, government rules are catching up. In 2012, the California Legislature directed the DMV to regulate the emerging technology. Rules that the agency first proposed in January went into effect Tuesday. Among them: . — Test drivers must have a sparkling driving record, complete a training regimen and enroll in a program that informs their employer if they get in an accident or are busted for driving under the influence off hours. — Companies must carry $5 million of insurance for each vehicle and report to the state how many times their vehicles unexpectedly disengage from self-driving mode, whether due to a failure of the technology or because the human driver takes over in an emergency. A Google self-driving car goes on a test drive near the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif . California passed its law after Nevada and Florida and before Michigan. The federal government has not acted, and national regulations appear to be years away. It's impossible to know the total number of self-driving cars being tested on public roads because, unlike California and Nevada, Michigan does not require special permits to test self-driving cars on public roads. Toyota, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors are 'all running around here with some form of autonomous vehicle,' said James Fackler, assistant administrator for the Michigan Department of State, which registers motor vehicles. Carmakers do not need a permit — manufacturer's license plates are enough, and those plates can also be used on future models or other kinds of experimental cars. Nevada has issued several test vehicle licenses to Google, VW and the auto supplier Continental, according to its Department of Motor Vehicles. In Florida, only Audi has tested self-driving technology and it is not ongoing, according to a spokesman for the state's motor vehicles department. With California's testing rules in effect, the DMV is drafting regulations that will govern self-driving cars once they are ready for the general public. Those rules, which the DMV must finish by year's end, will untie knotty issues such as whether a person needs to be in the vehicle at all.

"In the future will it be possible to have houses that expand and contract as it gets hotter and colder? That’s the dream of a team of students who have designed a shape-shifting prototype that can bend and twist at high temperatures. The structure responds to temperature changes which could allow for future constructions that can be shape-shifted as needed using heat-carrying wires embedded in the structures. Researchers at Barcelona’s Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalunya have designed a prototype structure that can change shape (shown). When it is heated above 60°C it expands and grows into a new form and holds its shape when it cools . The project is the work of students Ece Tankal, Efilena Baseta and Ramin Shambayati from Barcelona’s Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalunya (IAAC). Their supervisors are Areti Markopoulou, Alexandre Dubor and Moritz Begle. Called Translated Geometries, the project makes use of something called Shape Memory Polymers (SMP) to create the responsive architecture. Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have created a shape-shifting material from wax and foam . It's hoped the material will lead to robots being able to change from a rigid to liquid-like state. It is self-healing, and the material could be used to build deformable surgical robots, which would move through the body with ease to reach a particular point. It could also be used in search and rescue situations in the future. When the temperature is raised to 60 to 70°C (140 to 158°F), the prototype undergoes geometric deformations in an origami-like process. As it cools it retains the newly acquired shape, returning to its original flat state when it is heated again. While this means it only moves when it is heated, the team says it is an important goal towards architecture that can respond to its environment. The prototype is made of plywood, with embedded wires heating the various triangulated segments. Through expansion alone the prototype could increase its surface area by up to four times, reports Wired. As to the potential uses of the prototype, Shambayati tells MailOnline: 'At the moment we envision a multi-purpose public structure or pavilion that is able to transform on a daily basis depending on the specific need, site, amount of users, and event. 'For example, imagine an outdoor gallery or performance space that can be reshaped for different scenarios. 'As for houses, it’s too early to say but it could perhaps be most incorporated into a home’s main living space. 'Perhaps in the future the ability for a living and entertaining space to be able to transform and host a variety of guests or events would be interesting.' While this means it only moves when it is heated, the team says it is an important goal towards architecture that can respond to its environment. The prototype (shown) is made of plywood, with embedded wires heating the various triangulated segments . Drones and gravity (shown) can also be used to pull it into different arrangements. When it cools it solidifies in the new position and flattens when heated again. While only a prototype for now the researchers say it could one day lead to houses that change with temperature . In addition they show how, when heated, the prototype doesn’t just expand - it can actually be moulded as well. They demonstrated this by using drones, inflatables and gravity to pull the structure into new shapes. ‘We decided that, to best suit our want for structural adaptability we needed to find a geometry that could arrive on site in an original state and then having the capacity to deform or expand into a desired shape from actuation forces,’ Shambayati explains on his website. ‘Therefore, a somewhat foldable structure was deemed to be able to give us this required expansion upon arrival on site, which is why we looked into rigid foldable origami patterns.'","Researchers at Barcelona’s Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalunya have designed a prototype structure that can change shape .

"Nasa has revealed that Boeing and SpaceX will build America's first private spacecraft to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. The long awaited $6.8bn deal to replace the Space Shuttle and end reliance on Russia's Soyuz craft was revealed at the Kennedy Space Center, where launches will take place from 2017. 'I'm giddy today, I'll admit,' Nasa administrator Charles Golden said as he made the historic announcement Nasa hopes will spark an explosion in private space activities. Scroll down for video . Space race: Elon Musk unveils his Dragon V2 shuttle which is capable of launching up to seven astronauts into orbit. Nasa revealed today it is one of two craft selected to begin shuttling astronauts to the International space Station in 2017. The CST-100 spacecraft will at first be used to take astronauts to the ISS, pictured. However, Boeing also envisages a future where it is used to transport astronauts to private spacecraft such as Bigelow Aerospace's inflatable habitats, which will be launched in the future . Boeing's design would be launched into space using the Atlas 5 rocket built by the United Launch Alliance, a venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. It will take crews of seven people to the ISS and other destinations . That rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine, which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with Russia. 'From day one, the Obama Administration made clear that the greatest nation on Earth should not be dependent on other nations to get into space,' Nasa Administrator Charlie Bolden said at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. 'Thanks to the leadership of President Obama, the hard work of our NASA and industry teams, and support from Congress, today we are one step closer to launching our astronauts from U.S. soil on American spacecraft and ending the nation’s sole reliance on Russia by 2017. 'Turning over low-Earth orbit transportation to private industry will also allow NASA to focus on an even more ambitious mission – sending humans to Mars.' The two Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contracts are designed to complete the NASA certification for human space transportation systems capable of carrying people into orbit. Once certification is complete, NASA plans to use these systems to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station and return them safely to Earth. 'Today we don't know who will be the first commander - but we know is will be a major achievement for our nation,' said Golden. Under the deal, Boeing will be given $4.2bn and SpaceX $2.6bn. Nasa hopes it will spur private development in space. 'Ideally several years from now there will be other laboraties where people will be going - that's the vision of a commercial space industry,' said Golden. The contracts include at least one crewed flight test per company with at least one NASA astronaut aboard to verify the fully integrated rocket and spacecraft system can launch, maneuver in orbit, and dock to the space station, as well as validate all its systems perform as expected. Once each company’s test program has been completed successfully and its system achieves NASA certification, each contractor will conduct at least two, and as many as six, crewed missions to the space station. These spacecraft also will serve as a lifeboat for astronauts aboard the station. ""We are excited to see our industry partners close in on operational flights to the International Space Station, an extraordinary feat industry and the NASA family began just four years ago,"" said Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. ""This space agency has long been a technology innovator, and now we also can say we are an American business innovator, spurring job creation and opening up new markets to the private sector. 'The agency and our partners have many important steps to finish, but we have shown we can do the tough work required and excel in ways few would dare to hope.' The companies will own and operate the crew transportation systems and be able to sell human space transportation services to other customers in addition to NASA, thereby reducing the costs for all customers. the craft will replace the Space Shuttle following its retirement. The final shuttle mission was completed with the landing of Atlantis on July 21, 2011, bringing about the end of the 30-year Space Shuttle program. Earlier this year Boeing took a major step forward in its bid to replace the space shuttle. The aerospace giant completed a key review of its design for a new commercial venture to fly astronauts to the International Space Station. The multibillion-dollar program has taken on new urgency in recent months, given escalating tensions with Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine. John Mulholland, vice president and program manager for Boeing's commercial space exploration programs, said the company faced some difficult challenges as it developed its design, but got 'excellent' feedback from Nasa during the review last month. Boeing's CST will take crews of seven people to the ISS and other destinations from 2017, it was revealed today. 'From a technical standpoint, the review went very well,' he said. 'To the best of my knowledge we’re the only CCiCAP competitor that actually was able to complete all of the milestones in the period of performance,' he said. Mulholland said, measured in mass, the Boeing design for the cargo module was 96-percent complete at the time of the review, while its design for the crew module was 85-percent complete, two metrics that underscored the maturity of the design. He said the critical design review marked a major step for the Boeing program. 'You've got to be able to stand up at that review and show the analysis and tests that demonstrate that you're going to be able to meet those requirements,' he said. Boeing remains confident it could complete work on the new spacecraft in time to begin flight tests in 2017, Mulholland said. Boeing's design would be launched into space using the Atlas 5 rocket built by the United Launch Alliance, a venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. That rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine, which has also triggered some concerns given tensions with Russia. He said the module was designed from the beginning to be compatible with other launch vehicles, if necessary, although that would still entail some modification of the interface between the spacecraft and the launcher. Since the Space Shuttle was retired in July 2011, the US has relied on Russia to get its astronauts into orbit. But through their Commercial Crew Program, Nasa has been busy funding the development of a new breed of spacecraft. Next generation: SpaceX says the shuttle will provide a less expensive way to connect to the Space Station . Boeing has unveiled a mockup of the interior of their new Crew Space Transportation (CST-100) vehicle that will be used to astronauts into space in the coming years. The capsule is funded by Nasa as part of their programme to develop private spacecraft . Boeing’s vision for the future of human spaceflight is the Crew Space Transportation (CST-100). They unveiled the new commercial interior . of its CST-100 next-generation manned space . capsule, showing how people other than Nasa astronauts may one day . travel to space. This is the first time they have made the design of the interior public. Boeing and partner Bigelow Aerospace highlighted the future commercial interior of the capsule it is developing for Nasa, while Bigelow showcased a full-scale model of its BA 330 inflatable space habitat that astronauts could one day live in. 'We are moving into a truly commercial space market and we have to consider our potential  customers - beyond Nasa - and what they need in a future commercial spacecraft interior,' said Chris Ferguson, former Space Shuttle Atlantis commander and current Boeing director of Crew and Mission Operations for the Commercial Crew Program. Engineers from across Boeing leveraged the company's decades of experience in commercial and government aerospace to design the capsule's interior. The capsule, interior view of a prototype pictured, will be able to seat a crew of seven and it will also be able to take cargo into orbit. It is in direct competition with SpaceX's manned Dragon capsule and Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser space plane, all of which are vying to be the first private company to take humans into space . 'Boeing's teams have been designing award-winning and innovative interiors for our airplanes since the dawn of commercial aviation,' said Rachelle Ornan, regional director of Sales and Marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. 'Designing the next-generation interior for commercial space is a natural progression. A familiar daytime blue sky scene helps passengers maintain their connection with Earth.'

"True to its word, Apple has ramped up security on its iCloud service by including backups in its two-step verification process. When the security feature is enabled, users will now be sent a four-digit code to a trusted device that must be entered in addition to the iCloud account password when accessing the account online. Earlier this month, chief executive Tim Cook promised to strengthen security after hackers stole hundreds of celebrity selfies from the cloud service. Scroll down for video . The California-based tech giant’s two-step verification initially covered iTunes and App Store purchases, but has now been extended to cover iCloud backups. When two-step verification is enabled, users will now need to enter a code to access their account - however, the Find My Phone feature will remain open (pictured) The code isn't needed when a backup takes place, because the information is coming directly from a trusted device - it is only needed when users try to access their iCloud account from a web browser. Under the security measure, the majority of iCloud features remain locked until the user's identity has been verified. The only feature that is enabled without verification is the Find My Phone tool, which helps locate devices if they are lost or stolen. It is possible for users to enhance the security of their documents by turning off iCloud through Settings > iCloud on their device when they are not using it. They can also turn on two-step verification for their iCloud account. The tool prevents people accessing accounts - even if they have the password. To set up two-step verification, go to My Apple ID. Select Manage your Apple ID and sign in, then select Password and Security. Under Two-Step Verification, select Get Started and follow the onscreen instructions. When a user sets up two-step verification, they register one or more trusted devices. A trusted device is one that can receive four-digit verification codes using either SMS or Find My iPhone. Once enabled, any time a user signs in to manage their Apple ID at My Apple ID, or make an iTunes, App Store, or iBooks Store purchase from a new device, they'll need to verify their identity by entering both their password and a four-digit verification code. It is assumed that if a user doesn't have their trusted device, they can't receive the four-digit verification code. Two-step verification is an optional security feature, and settings are managed through the My Apple ID page. Two-step verification, also called two-factor authentication, requires a user to have two of . three things to access an account. This can include a password, . a separate four-digit one-time code, or a long access key given . to the user when they signed up for the service. When a user sets up two-step verification, they register one or more trusted devices. A trusted device is one that can receive four-digit verification codes using either SMS or Find My iPhone. Apple has begun emailing customers informing them of the changes, and more details are available from the official two-step verification support page. More than 100 celebrity iCloud account were hacked in August and photos, including nude selfies, were leaked online. At the start of the month, Mr Cook told the Wall Street Journal Apple will 'aggressively encourage . users to take stricter security measures', and the firm will also alert users if someone tries to access their files. These alerts will be sent using email and push notifications each time someone tries to change an account password, restore iCloud . data to a new device, or when a device logs into an account for . the first time. 'When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,' Mr Cook said. 'I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing.' The code is sent to a registered, trusted device (pictured). If users no longer have access to a trusted device, they can use a recovery key to add a new one. This key is issued during the two-step verification setup process . The changes come following the recent celebrity photo scandal that saw hundreds of images stolen from Apple's iCloud service. Chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) recently said Apple will also start notifying users each time someone tries to access their account . Once enabled, any time a user signs in to manage their Apple ID at My Apple ID, or make an iTunes, App Store, or iBooks Store purchase from a new device and now access their iCloud account on a browser, they'll need to verify their identity by entering both their password and a four-digit verification code. 'We want to do everything we can do to protect our customers, because we are as outraged if not more so than they are,' continued Mr. Cook. The iCloud service lets users store photos and other . content, and access it from any Apple device. Scammers have been taking advantage of the celebrity hacking scandal to trick people into entering their Apple ID and password details into a fake login screen. Jennifer Lawrence (pictured) was among the 101 celebrities who had their photos stolen from iCloud. She is said to have posted more than 60 nude selfies to the online service . Security experts recently discovered emails and text messages that claim to be from Apple, warning users about unauthorised access to their accounts. The latest threat to people's accounts comes as both the FBI and Apple have said they are investigating the link. The so-called phishing emails are designed to trick people into offering up their details. Apple already offers a high-level of security on its iCloud account. iCloud secures data by encrypting it when it is sent over the web, storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server, and using secure tokens for authentication (explained above). This suggests the hackers were able to obtain the login credentials of the accounts, and pretend to be the user, in order to bypass this encryption . The service secures data by encrypting it when it is sent over the web, storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server, and using secure tokens for authentication. Tim Barajin, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies, told MailOnline: 'Security in the cloud is an issue generally - you have to completely trust Google, Apple, Samsung. 'Apple has some of the most powerful encryption tools out there - which is why they have almost a billion credit cards of file, and nobody had ever got hold of those.'","Apple’s two-step verification initially covered iTunes and the App Store .

"It doesn’t matter whether it is a human child crying, or the call of a lost fawn: Mammals know a young creature in need when they hear it. A study has found that the sound of a crying child is recognised and acted upon by wild deer. During tests, wild mule and white-tailed deer ran to the rescue of distress calls made by various mammals including humans, cats and even infant silver-haired bats. During tests, wild mule (stock image pictured) and white-tailed deers responded equally to the cries of their own fawns as those of humans, cats and even infant silver-haired bats. Researchers wanted to test the theory that mammal mothers can recognise the distress call of any infant, regardless of species . The researchers wanted to test the theory that a mammal mother's instinct can recognise calls of any infant, regardless of species. Previous studies have found that humans react to the distress calls of their own children, but also infant pets such as dog and cats. The same has been found for domestic dogs, who have been known to react to the cries of newborn humans. However, in both instances, it was assumed this was as a result of the domestication of these animals. Researchers from Canada claim the findings of the deer study may  explain why the frequency of distress calls differs among mammals - to make it easier for species to identify each other. A recent study found that humans have evolved to look physically different from each other, for a similar reason. Researchers from University of California at Berkeley explained that most animal species use smell or sound to identify each other - but people rely primarily on sight to differentiate individuals. Many animals are visually almost indistinguishable from each other, particularly those which are active at night. But humans have developed to be physically unique, according to the new research, giving rise to a wide variety in hair colours, eye pigmentation, height and facial features. To see if this theory rang true among wild animals, Susan Lingle of the University of Winnipeg in Canada and Tobias Riede from Midwestern University in Glendale, Arizona record the cries of various infant mammals. This included humans, fur seals, cats, dogs, young yellow-bellied marmots, sea lions, domestic cats, silver-haired bats, and several other deer species. They also recorded more generic animal sounds such as birdsong and coyotes barking. Each of these recordings were played using hidden speakers to wild female mule and white-tailed deers in Canada, while researchers monitored the deer’s behaviour from afar. The calls were played as they would normally be heard, as well as at various altered pitch levels. A positive response was recorded if the deer approached the speaker, which is similar to how they would react if their own fawn was crying. When the frequency of the individual calls was similar to that of a young mule deer, the female would approach the speaker - regardless of which mammal the cry belonged to. The female deer came within 32 ft (10 metres) of the speaker, indicating a stronger response, when the calls of seals, marmots, and other deer species were played. She came within 82ft (25 metres) during the calls of sea lions, bats and humans. However, she didn’t approach when the pitch fell outside the range of her fawn’s call. Recordings were played to the deers using hidden speakers, while researchers monitored the deer’s behaviour. A positive response was recorded if the deer approached the speaker. The deers came within 32ft (10 metres) of the speaker during the calls of fur seals (left) , marmots (right) and other deer species . The deers came within 82ft (25 metres) during the calls of sea lions, cats bats and humans. However, they didn’t approach when the pitch fell outside the range of her fawn’s call . To test whether she was simply responding to pitch, rather than the type of call, the researchers then played the generic noises. In every instance, the female deer did not react to these control sounds, even when they were played at the same pitch as the fawn’s call, suggesting the mothers could distinguish between the two types of noises. ‘Acoustic structure, behavioural context, and caregiver responses to infant distress cries are similar across mammals, including humans,’ said the researchers. ‘Our results suggest that acoustic traits of infant distress vocalisations that are essential for a response by caregivers, and a caregiver’s sensitivity to these acoustic traits, may be shared across diverse mammals. They also state that the results could explain why the frequency of distress calls differs among mammals, to make it easier for species to identify each other. The findings are published in the journal The American Naturalist. To test whether the deers were responding to pitch, rather than the type of call, the researchers played control noises, such as birdsong (stock image). The female deers did not react to these sounds, even when they were played at the same pitch as the fawn’s call, suggesting they could distinguish between the two types of noises .","Researchers from Canada recorded the cries of various baby mammals .

"Greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2013 driven by a surge in the level of carbon dioxide, a study claims. Experts say carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations grew at the fastest rate since reliable global records began and have called for international action to combat climate change. The rise in CO2 levels is outpacing fossil fuel use, suggesting that the planet's natural ability to soak up emissions of the gas may be slowing down. Scroll down for video . Greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2013, driven by a surge in the level of carbon dioxide, a study claims. A stock image os power plant smokestacks belching out CO2 are shown . ‘We know without any doubt that our climate is changing and our weather is becoming more extreme due to human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels,’ said Michel Jarraud, the Secretary General of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in Geneva, Switzerland. ‘It may be due to the reduced uptake of CO2 by the biosphere,' Mr Jarraud told a news conference, but said more research is needed. ‘If that is confirmed, it is of significant concern.’ The biosphere - which includes plants and soil - and the oceans, each absorb around a quarter of man-made CO2 emissions. If that ratio falls, more of the planet-warming gas will remain in the atmosphere, where it can stay for hundreds of years. Experts say carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations grew at the fastest rate since reliable global records began and have called for international action to combat climate change, which is warming the arctic (stock image) The IPCC said it expects 'multiple stresses and systemic failures due to climate change' in the Mediterranean. This will increase energy costs and damage tourism from 2050. North America: Flooding will be a major threat in this area with rain and storms moving north of New York. Southern areas are expected to experience a shortage of water. Asia: The majority of the people directly affected by sea level rise will be in southern and eastern Asia. However, water is also expected to affect most of Asia. Australasia: There remains uncertainty about impact in Australasia, but extreme weather is predicted. The Great Barrier Reef will continue to degrade, with warmer water bleaching more coral. Africa: Food security will be a major issue for Africa. Crops and livestock will be affected by both flooding and drought. There will also be more soil erosion from storms. Central and South America: Scientists expect Northern Brazil may lose 22 per cent of its annual rainfall by 2100, while the area around Chile could get a 25 per cent increase. The WMO said that the ocean is getting rapidly more acidic, impairing its ability to absorb carbon dioxide and  the rate of ocean acidification is unprecedented at least over the past 300 million years. WMO scientific officer Oksana Tarasova, said: ‘The total change of ocean acidity since pre-industrial (times)... is 25 percent, and six percent was done within the last 10 years.’ Even if human-made carbon emissions fall by 80 per cent by 2050, the total warming effect of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will have barely receded by 2100. The longer fossil fuel use grows, the harder it will be to reverse the warming effect, the WMO said. Mr Jarraud explained: ‘Past, present and future CO2 emissions will have a cumulative impact on both global warming and ocean acidification. The laws of physics are non-negotiable. We are running out of time.’ The volume of carbon dioxide - the main greenhouse gas emitted by human activities - was 396 parts per million (ppm) in 2013 - 2.9 ppm higher than in 2012. This was the largest year-to-year increase since 1984, when reliable global records began. Methane, the second most important greenhouse gas, reached a global average of 1824 parts per billion (ppb), increasing at a similar rate as the last five years. The other main contributor, nitrous oxide, reached 325.9 ppb, growing at a rate comparable to the average over the past decade. Greenhouse gas emissions are rising mainly due to industrial growth in China, India and other emerging economy nations, according to the WMO. The UN's panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 per cent probable that human activities are the main driver of global warming since 1950. This chart shows global temperature trends from 1950 until last year . Almost 200 governments have agreed to work out a deal to limit global warming at a summit in Paris next year. Experts aim to keep global warming within 2°C (3.6°F) above pre-industrial times – goals that were set by the UN in 2010. Mr Jarraud said that if this was achieved, it would ‘give our planet a chance and ... our children and grandchildren a future’. The UN's panel of climate scientists says it is at least 95 per cent probable that human activities are the main driver of global warming since 1950. An IPCC report that was leaked last month, said that Global warming is impacting 'all continents and across the oceans'. This map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents . Global warming is already here, man-made and dangerous, according to an IPCC report that was leaked last month. The report, which is the most severe warning issued yet, also claims it is increasingly likely that the heating trend could be irreversible. Global warming, it says, is impacting 'all continents and across the oceans' and further pollution from heat-trapping gases will raise the likelihood of severe impacts for mankind. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last month sent governments a final draft of its synthesis report, which combined three earlier, gigantic documents by group. There is little in the report that wasn't in the other more-detailed versions, but the language is more stark and the report attempts to connect the different scientific disciplines studying problems caused by the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas. It says: 'Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.' Depending on circumstances and values, 'currently observed impacts might already be considered dangerous.' The report mentions extreme weather and rising sea levels, such as heat waves, flooding and droughts and raises the idea that climate change will worsen violent conflicts and refugee problems and could hinder efforts to grow more food. It claims that ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life. Without changes in greenhouse gas emissions, 'climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century,' according to the IPCC.","World Meteorological Organisation report says CO2 concentrations grew at the fastest rate since reliable global records began in 1984 .

"Short of a quid for your next holiday? Maybe you're forgetting something. While we have no problem changing our pounds into the currency of our holiday destinations, a study has found more than £550 million in foreign cash is laying about in British homes waiting to be converted back. Money saving website Vouchercodespro.co.uk claims up to two fifths of Brits have un-exchanged cash leftover from their getaways. The survery of 2,748 people from around the UK aged over 18 found 61 per cent of them had gone on a holiday overseas in the past year which required them to get foreign currency. Euro stash!: British travellers are keeping their foreign currency after their holidays rather than converting it . Conversion: Two in five Brits have money they haven't changed back to pounds . Asked if they had money they've yet to change back to pounds, 41 per cent those surveyed said yes. Reasons for keeping the foreign money included holding onto it for a future holiday (27 per cent) and they didn't see the point given poor exchange rates (21 per cent). Others didn't have time (14 per cent), had mostly coins which couldn't be exchanged (13 per cent)  or forgot (7 per cent). The most common forms of currency Brits have squirrelled away is Euros (44 per cent), US dollars (22 per cent) and Turkish Lira (21 per cent). The survey found the average British adult has £27.13 in foreign currency, adding up to the substantial total estimate of £551,715,680 . Under the sofa: British holidaymakers are effectively leaving money under their couches after their breaks . '£551million sure is a lot of money for Britons to abandon and leave lying around their homes, whether they can’t be bothered to exchange it or not,' said VoucherCodesPro spokesperson George Charles. 'We understand that it’s frustrating that travel agents, supermarkets and the like don’t exchange coins, only notes, which will lead to people being left with a handful of coins, but if you have any cash notes remaining then you should always make an effort to exchange them – it’s more money in your pocket to spend or save, after all.'","Study finds two in five Brits have foreign cash they haven't changed back .

"Game of Thrones star Natalie Dormer loves spending time in Bali. Whether it’s diving in Lombok or skiing with friends, the 32-year-old likes nothing better than going on holiday. The Reading lass loves adventure and counts her travels down the western coast of Goa as one of her most memorable life experiences. Natalie, who plays Queen Margaery Tyrell in the popular American fantasy drama, has a soft spot for London and enjoys spending time on the South Bank. Natalie plays Queen Margaery Tyrell in the popular fantasy drama Game of Thrones. Her character is known for her beauty, political cunning and ambition . The actress first went to Rome when she was 18, while backpacking around Europe with a friend . Here the talented actress, who travelled to Rome to narrate a story for travel brand Contiki, tells MailOnline Travel about India's rail system, her favourite places in London and two things she cannot travel without. What sort of traveller are you? What are your favourite types of holidays? I love all sorts. I love walking holidays and skiing with friends, but in recent years I've been so busy with work that I’m only able to go on holiday once a year. Lately it’s tended to be somewhere hot to unwind on a beach and scuba dive. Because of my job I get a lot of opportunity to grab a few days here and there in many cool cities for press commitments, magazine shoots and premieres —Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Paris, Stockholm, New York, Berlin. I always try to get to a gallery or museum if there's time. Have you ever been to New Zealand or Canada and if you haven't, are they on your bucket list? I have been to Canada several times. It was autumn when I visited Vancouver and I will always remember the colour of the trees in British Columbia were stunning. I have shot in Toronto and find it a very trendy, friendly city. I look forward to having opportunity to go back for the film festivaI. I would love to go to New Zealand and try some of the adventurous stuff to be found in Queenstown. Both my cousin and my brother loved the Tongariro Alpine Crossing. As a family we were all brought up hiking so I'd like to do that. I definitely need to return to Asia. I got to Bali and Lombok last year. The Gili Islands gave me some of my best scuba diving experiences including tons of turtles. Natalie stars alognside Diana Rigg in the epic series. The adventurous actress loved shooting the series in Croatia . The 32-year-old has been so busy lately that she only gets to go on holiday once a year . 'The Gili Islands gave me some of my best diving experiences including tons of turtles,' Natalie says . What’s been your most memorable life experience? Travelling down the western coast of India. We travelled down from Mumbai and into Goa and then much further down into Kerala. I loved Kerala – fresh coconut juice every day! The train system in India is chaotic and fun – it's the best way to see the landscape. Being in with all the families and also being the odd animal is a colourful experience you’ll never forget. I would love to go to the Himalayas and cross over into Nepal to do the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. What are your favourite places in London? I love the South Bank – there is always something going on down by the river there. It's home to some of our greatest cultural institutions like the National Theatre, the Hayward Gallery, the British Film Institute, the Royal Festival Hall. There’s also the famous outdoor book stall and the skate park with its funky graffiti and groups of young skaters. You can check out the food market down there, hit up great bars and restaurants and visit the Christmas market in December. Plus, you get incredible views of The Thames, St Paul's Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and central London. You can just stroll along and take in the view. Natalie considers her trip down the west coast of India as one of her most memorable experiences . The actress surprised a group of young travellers in Rome and posed for photos and chatted  to them . What is one thing you cannot leave home without and why when you travel? There are two things. First of all, my yoga mat comes everywhere. Keeps me stretched out after sitting still on all those planes, trains and road journeys. You need a great hat too. If it's hot it'll keep the sun off your face, if it's cold it will keep the heat in, if you need to sleep you pull it down over your eyes and if your hair is starting to get a bit greasy from all the travelling, it hides it when you're in desperate need of a shower! What’s the most amazing shoot location you’ve been on for Game of Thrones? The most amazing set where I’ve shot Game of Thrones is definitely Croatia, in Dubrovnik. It’s such a stunning country with lots of good watersports there as well. Just a beautiful, beautiful place. What attracted you to this particular project and why did you want to work with a youth travel brand? Travel is so important in its capacity to expand the mind. It’s exciting to start as young as possible – you get to see how other cultures live, challenge your senses and try different cuisines. Travel also shows you the diverse wildlife we share this planet with and gives you perspective on just how huge the Earth is. My first time to Rome was when I was backpacking with my best friend around Europe for a month at 18 years old, so I remember that excitement of being away from home properly for the first time.","Westoros Queen loves walking holidays and skiiing with friends .

"A dog owner says she owes her life to her Doberman after he detected a tumour in her breast. Diane Papazian, from New York, says Troy persistently nuzzled into her breast when he was just a four-month-old puppy. Mrs Papazian then realised Troy was showing an interest in a lump and decided to go for a mammogram - despite having had one just six months earlier. Scroll down for video . Diane Papazian, 56, says she owes her life to her dog, Troy, after he detected a tumour in her breast . As a result, she was diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer.

"'Daft': The news will alarm a growing number of jam-makers . The threat of jam-makers being fined under EU rules for selling or donating produce in re-used jars triggered anger and exasperation yesterday. Stalls offering home-made conserves and chutneys are a staple of summer fetes, church fairs and other charity fundraisers. However an advisory body linked to the Church of England has warned parishes that re-using jars breached EU health rules – and could result in a £5,000 fine or even jail. In a letter entitled ‘this is not a . spoof’, the Churches’ Legislation Advisory Service said that following . advice from the Food Standards Agency members are not allowed ‘to make . jam, put it in re-used jam jars then either sell it or even give it away . at a public event’. The Women’s Institute has offered similar advice to its 210,000 members. The EU regulations ban the re-use of . containers unless they are specifically designed for this. The aim is to . prevent chemicals leaching out of old containers and contaminating . food. However, the FSA says enforcement is . down to individual local authorities. Last night, Environment Secretary . Owen Paterson called for ‘common sense’ to prevail. He said: ‘Re-using a few jars to sell homemade jam at a fete is at the heart of British country life. ‘There hasn’t been a single prosecution since these rules were introduced and I sincerely hope that there won’t be any. ‘What’s called for here is a good dose . of healthy common sense from everyone.’ Glass warfare: The Women's Institute is warning its 210,000 members about the European regulations . Take note: The written circular from the Churches' Legislation Advisory Service . The regulations have caused . alarm within the Church community. Canon Michael Tristram of Portsmouth . Cathedral, said: ‘On realising that this was not a belated April Fool’s . joke, I was very anxious, not only from the fund-raising point of view, . but also because it goes against the green agenda of recycling. 'We jam- . and marmalade-makers sterilise our jars as a matter of course.’ There was also consternation from the . WI, with its chairman Ruth Bond saying: ‘WI members have been making jam . and chutney for sale through local fetes and fairs since the . organisation’s beginnings in 1915 and consumers’ safety is always a top . priority.’ Cookery writer Mary Berry, who is a . judge on the BBC’s The Great British Bake Off, was more forthright. She . said: ‘This is absolutely stupid. ‘We are encouraging people to save . money by using fruits to make chutneys and jam, and if they have to buy . new jars it will become much too expensive. It’s daft.’ A spokesman for the FSA confirmed the . EU rule but added that it was not aware ‘of any evidence indicating that . re-use of jam jars presents a food safety concern in terms of migration . of chemicals from jam jars into food’.","Churches warn parishioners to stop selling preserves in re-used jars .

"A veteran Fox executive who used her company email account to plan aid for loved ones of the missing Malaysian airplane's passengers has been fired. Darlene Tipton, who was vice president of standards and practices for the Fox Cable Networks Group, said Saturday she had wanted to arrange swift financial aid to families and other loved ones, sparing them lengthy court fights. She said she began by emailing Sarah Bajc, an American whose boyfriend, Philip Wood, was a passenger on Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and who has made frequent TV appearances since the plane's March 8 disappearance. Fox spokesman Scott Grogin said Tipton's 'conduct and communications' violated company policy. Citing privacy concerns, he declined to discuss particulars, but he said, 'As soon as we became aware, we took appropriate steps.' He confirmed that Tipton has left the company. Darlene Tipton was fired from Fox after 25 years of employment because she used her company email account to send emails in order to raise money for the families of those on board Flight 370 . Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 mysteriously disappeared on March 8 . Tipton was with Fox for a quarter-century before her April 9 dismissal. She said she plans to continue with her initiative, soliciting contributions through the crowdfunding website GoFundMe. 'We want to raise money for families, to give them immediate relief,' Tipton said during a phone interview from her Los Angeles home. 'Otherwise, they could be in court for years.' A condition of accepting the money she hopes to raise: Recipients must waive the right to seek legal remedy. 'If they're getting money through contributions,' she said, 'it isn't right for them to seek money through legal channels, too.' But she plans to sue Fox for wrongful termination, said her husband, Ken Tipton, a writer and producer. He said the idea for the fundraising effort stemmed from his Los Angeles hospital stay last month, shortly after the plane disappeared. He said that while he was under medication he had hallucinations of being with the plane's passengers and the power of his visions spurred him and his wife to try to help. 'She wanted to do it because it could be done,' he said. 'So why not try?' The investigation into what happened to Flight 370, a Boeing 777 that was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board, continued Saturday with searches of a patch of the Indian Ocean seabed. Tipton's firing was first reported by Christine Negroni in her blog Flying Lessons. Darlene's husband Ken had visions of helping those on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 while he was in the hospital on medication .","Fox spokesman Scott Grogin said Darlene Tipton's 'conduct and communications' violated company policy .

"Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino reminds me of Brian Clough. The kind of guy who says what he likes, and likes what he says. Don Revie didn’t like Clough, and I’m not convinced the greatest manager in Leeds’ history would have appreciated Cellino. Yet most Leeds fans seem to adore the Italian. Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino (centre) is pictured in the stands with the fans at Brentford on Saturday . Absurd as it sounds, having a beer with fans in The Old Peacock close to the stadium, and sitting in the away end at Brentford on Saturday, has led to a situation where the Leeds fans will worship the ground Cellino walks on, and accept some of the bizarre decisions he has made in the short time he has been in charge. Cellino might turn out to be the best owner Leeds have ever had – I hope so because the city needs a thriving, healthy club to serve its huge fanbase. I lived and worked in Leeds when they last won the title in the top flight – I’m aware what the club means and how important it is in the city. On the face of it, it’s shocking that Leeds fans are so welcoming of this guy: he only turned his attention to Leeds after failing to buy West Ham. This doesn’t mean he has bad intentions, but the any club will do' approach naturally invites scepticism. Cellino asked for a huge fee from Fulham for Ross McCormack, and he got it. Fair play to him for that. So why tell the press the player refused to train, when on that day McCormack claims he was having his medical in London? No need for that from the owner, unless he’s desperate to win favour with fans. I’ve heard Leeds supporters declare openly that Cellino’s version is what 'REALLY' happened, dismissing McCormack’s version for no real reason other than he’s no longer connected to Leeds. How can they be so sure? Fulham's Ross McCormack (centre) pictured during a club training session earlier this month . Brian McDermott was sacked and then reinstated and then sacked again. David Hockaday was hired from non-league - Cellino admitted he told Hockaday to 'shut the f***k up' and didn’t want his opinion. As most had predicted, Hocakday didn’t last long. If you include caretaker Neil Redfearn, there have been four managers at Leeds since Cellino took over in April. When asked why he has hired the new one, Darko Milanic, Cellino replied: 'He’s good-looking.' Throw in an ongoing troublesome yacht taxation issue back in Italy, which the Football League describes as a 'cloud hanging over Cellino' and which could still give the League cause to re-assess his qualification as a fit and proper person to own a club in this country, and it all makes you wonder why the Leeds fans have fallen for this guy. Surely a beer with the fans in the pub and a seat in the away end at Brentford weren’t enough to seduce supporters? Cellino (right) sits with former Leeds manager Brian McDermott at Vicarage Road in April this year . Spending money on players might have persuaded a few. But don’t they remember Peter Ridsdale? He spent huge amounts of money on players, and the financial collapse as a consequence was painful. The truth is this: Massimo Cellino is benefiting from Leeds’ recent history. Ken Bates’ regime created a massive rift between the fans and the club. Then GFH made a mess of things, leaving the fans disillusioned and desperate. So desperate that they have seemingly taken this sacking-machine Italian with a potentially nuclear tax bomb waiting to explode, into their hearts. Former Leeds chairman Peter Ridsale (right) at the unveiling of new signing Robbie Keane in 2000 . I know only too well that if you say anything remotely negative about Leeds United, their fans will hammer you. So in the week he took control of the club, Cellino gave an interview and said the words that he knew would capture the love and dedication of so many long-suffering fans. He had them when he said: 'The fans of Leeds are tired of eating sh*t and shutting their mouths.' Those fans fell for Cellino right then. I hope he doesn’t break their hearts.","Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino sat with the fans in the away end at Brentford on Saturday .

Marc Pugh celebrates the second of his three goals against Birmingham  in Bournemouth's 8-0 win . West Brom . Strikers Victor Anichebe and Brown Ideye could start for West Brom at Bournemouth with head coach Alan Irvine likely to make several changes. Anichebe scored after coming off the substitutes' bench to help the Baggies to a 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace on Saturday while £10million summer buy Ideye is fit again after an ankle problem. Boaz Myhill could start in goal while Gareth McAuley, Cristian Gamboa and Youssouf Mulumbu may be recalled. Winger Silvestre Varela is unlikely to be risked as he recovers from groin surgery, Jonas Olsson is struggling with an Achilles problem while Claudio Yacob is in his native Argentina due to family illness. Provisional squad: Foster, Myhill, Pocognoli, Gamboa, Dawson, Lescott, McAuley, Davidson, Wisdom, Baird, Morrison, O'Neil, Mulumbu, Brunt, Blanco, Sessegnon, Samaras, Ideye, Berahino.

"Leading publishers Simon & Schuster are bringing out a book next month by former England rugby union international Brian Moore which many will regard as totally unsuitable for mainstream distribution. The book, titled What Goes on Tour Stays on Tour, is former hooker Moore’s memories of rugby trips around the world with England, the British and Irish Lions and club sides. It is promoted as ‘good clean fun’. Brian Moore's memories of rugby trips around the world feature in his new book . However, the juvenile, obscene contents are anything but — with Moore describing in graphic, sordid detail his own and others’ sexual exploits on tour while he says the first rule of selecting a tour party is: ‘No c****, however talented.’ Worst of all, the appendix includes the words of a number of rugby songs — hugely demeaning of women and the disabled — that will certainly offend more than a few readers. How Simon & Schuster could print the lyrics of Four and Twenty Virgins, The Sexual Life of the Camel and the Good Ship Venus is beyond belief. Both Helen Mockridge, publicist for the Moore book, and Ian Marshall, the sports editor responsible for commissioning it, refused to comment. FA chairman Greg Dyke and UEFA president Michel Platini both received a £16,400 watch . FA chairman Greg Dyke intends to snub a FIFA edict and not return one of the controversial £16,400 watches gifted by the Brazil football federation to Congress delegates before the World Cup. FIFA’s ethics committee have demanded that the 65 watches, whose value far exceeds the allowed limits, are handed back to Zurich by October 24. But Dyke announced at the official FA function at Wembley before the San Marino game that having paid the £3,000 import duty himself, he intended to put the watch up for auction with all the proceeds going to the FA-supported Breast Cancer Care charity. UEFA president Michel Platini also said he would be keeping his watch to donate to whom he wished. But it is now understood he has given it back to FIFA, leaving Dyke making a lone protest. Meanwhile, Giorgio Crescentini, president of the San Marino football federation, is not the hardest name to pronounce. So it caused plenty of head-shaking at the pre-match function when Dyke failed to do so twice. The FA’s attempts to make up for the late, great World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore (right) never receiving a knighthood now extends to a two-page promotion in the Wembley programme for England women’s game against Germany next month, saying the players are following in the footsteps of ‘Sir Bobby Moore’. England Cricket Board chief executive Tom Harrison is just one of many senior personnel leaving sports management giants IMG since the company was bought by Hollywood’s Ari Emanuel.  They include Jeff Slack, head of football — a sport less central to Emanuel’s plans than golf and tennis — and Andrew Wildblood, who manages relationships with the R&A and the All England Club. Both Slack and Wildblood cashed in seven-figure stakes in IMG when the takeover took place. KP’s let off the hook . Kevin Pietersen has had a relatively easy ride from his hand-picked interviewers this week. But it is understood BBC’s Garry Richardson, who asks hard questions, albeit repetitively, on his Sportsweek radio programme managed to really rile KP. Kevin Pietersen hand-picked his interviewers for launch of his autobiography . Meanwhile, the unseemly PR battle between Pietersen and the ECB this week is probably a high-scoring draw. But the ECB could have won easily if they had put up their employees Paul Downton and Andy Flower for questioning. The draw for the first round of the FA Cup will be filmed live by the BBC in front of an audience at St George’s Park on October 27, with the event also covered by Radio 5 Live. However, such focus makes it all the more embarrassing that the FA have yet to secure a £9million-a-year sponsor for their flagship competition. The FA keep saying they have interested parties. But if no deal is clinched soon the heat really will be on the commercial department. There is still remarkable interest in the England team as the 6.6m ITV peak viewing figure shows for the San Marino game, despite it being a waste of everybody’s time.","Brian Moore’s memories of rugby trips around the world with England .

"West Brom defender Craig Dawson is set to escape any action over an elbow on Crystal Palace goalkeeper Julian Speroni. Palace boss Neil Warnock called the incident an ‘assault’ but referee Mark Clattenburg is understood to have seen the challenge and allowed West Brom’s first goal — headed in by Victor Anichebe — to stand. Speroni required lengthy treatment before being taken off by Warnock, who said he wanted to protect the keeper from suffering any potential damage. Victor Anichebe headed home with 51 minutes on the clock at the Hawthorns after Craig Dawson's (25) elbow . The West Brom striker converted from close range following a corner from Chris Brunt . Warnock said: ‘It’s just like an assault. How come one of the four officials doesn’t see that? Dawson goes for about five yards with his elbow and smashes him in the face.’ Palace have conceded a league-high nine goals from set-pieces this season. Saido Berahino, 21, took his Premier League tally to seven with an added-time penalty to rescue a point for West Brom and head coach Alan Irvine believes the striker can become a real star. ‘Saido wants to know what Rooney was like at that age. He has got a real chance of being a top player. We just have to keep him heading in the right direction.’ Neil Warnock was angry with the decision not to award Crystal Palace a free-kick . Speroni was forced off shortly after West Brom's goal as the Argentine received a knock on his head .

"Beneath the arms and armour of a thousand years of monarchy, the former chief of the IRA’s Northern Command had dinner with the Sovereign at Windsor last night. And he heard her declare firmly: ‘We are walking together towards a brighter, more settled, future. We shall remember our past but we will no longer allow our past to ensnare our future.’ On a day brimming with powerful symbolism in honour of the first state visit by a President of the Republic of Ireland, there were so many historic moments to choose from – President Michael D Higgins bowing at Westminster Abbey’s Tomb of the Unknown Warrior and addressing both Houses of Parliament; the Irish head of state being invited (in Irish) to inspect the Grenadier Guards. But even the clattering pomp of a full state carriage procession through cheering Windsor streets festooned with the Irish tricolour could not match the significance of Martin McGuinness – in white tie and tails – rising to toast the Queen and the British people at last night’s state banquet. Scroll down for video . Then and now: The young Martin McGuinness in 1972 when he was leader of the Provisional IRA in Londonderry (left) and (right) photographed in his pomp at Windsor Castle last night . Mr McGuinness and his Sinn Fein colleagues had got it badly wrong when they boycotted the Queen’s momentous state visit to the Republic in 2011. On this reciprocal visit, he was determined not to misjudge the mood again. So it was that Mr McGuinness found himself seated just 16 places down from the Prince of Wales – between scientist Sir Paul Nurse and Shami Chakrabarti of the pressure group, Liberty. Shortly before taking his place, as the orchestra played a light Irish medley, he could be seen deep in conversation with both the British and Irish Prime Ministers. Martin McGuinness at the start of the State Banquet in honour of the Irish President at Windsor Castle with David Cameron, left and Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny . Martin McGuinness, the Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, top right, talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron, left, and Irish Prime Minister, Enda Kenny . There could hardly have been a more quintessentially British – or, indeed, English – setting. St George’s Hall, built in homage to England’s patron saint by Edward III, boasts Britain’s longest table, a 168ft mahogany piece longer than an Olympic swimming pool. Yesterday it was heaving with gold candelabra, flowers and more than 2,000 pieces of cutlery and linen. Every table setting (laid out with a ruler, 17 inches apart) included priceless Sevres china and Royal Brierley crystal. A dinner of Scottish halibut and tournedos of Windsor beef was accompanied by a 2005 Meursault and a fine claret, Chateau Leoville-Barton 1990. For teetotallers such as Mr McGuinness, there was Sandringham apple juice and Malvern water.Continuing the theme of her visit three years ago, the Queen urged her 160 guests – an unusually celeb-packed collection including Sir Terry and Lady Wogan and actors Daniel Day-Lewis and Dame Judi Dench – to look to the future. This was no mean feat in a 14th-century chamber lined with a dozen suits of armour and the shields of every Knight of the Garter in history. LEST WE FORGET . ‘The goal of modern British-Irish relations can be simply stated,’ said the Queen. ‘It is that we, who inhabit these islands, should live together as neighbours and friends; respectful of each other’s nationhood, sovereignty and traditions; co-operating to our mutual benefit; at ease in each other’s company.’ Dressed in her Diamond Jubilee portrait gown, she had even ordered emerald green droplets to be inserted into the Grand Duchess Vladimir tiara in honour of her guests. Just another subtle touch. So, too, was the harp playing Molly Malone as the royal procession came in to dinner. In what must rank as one of her most significant speeches in recent years, the Queen even made direct reference to her most controversial guest: ‘Our two governments will continue to work together in Northern Ireland to support the First and Deputy First Minister.’ Martin McGuinness at the start of the State Banquet in honour of the Irish President at Windsor Castle . The latter is also a man whose comrades-in-arms murdered the Duke of Edinburgh’s uncle, Earl Mountbatten, along with thousands of innocents. Yet the Queen first met Mr McGuinness during her Diamond Jubilee visit to Northern Ireland in 2012. Last night brought another introduction, away from the cameras, as all the guests were presented to the Queen, the Duke and Mr and Mrs Higgins on their way through to dinner. As protocol dictates, the Prince of Wales was not part of the greeting line (which involves only heads of state and their spouses) and so was not due to meet the former IRA capo. Given the Prince’s closeness to Lord Mountbatten, this was probably a relief to both. Labour leader Ed Milliband talks to Irish politician and former IRA leader Martin McGuinness at State Banquet at Windsor Castle . As ever the Queen was speaking on the advice of her ministers. The only veiled hint of any personal loss came as she reflected on ‘so much chequered history, the avoidable and regrettable pain of which is still felt by many of us’. Martin McGuinness photographed after a brief talk with David Cameron at the Banquet . The presence of Mr McGuinness was too much for some. Outside the castle, a small group of grieving families held up banners demanding justice for the victims of the IRA bombings in Omagh and Birmingham. The protesters, however, conceded . that the Queen had no option but to invite Mr McGuinness since that is . what her Government had asked of her. After all she has been obliged to entertain some 24-carat monsters in . her time, not least the Ceausescus of Romania and the Mobutus of Zaire . (who smuggled a dog in their luggage). A . key theme of this visit is the Irish contribution to British life. Last . night, the Queen saluted all the Irish-born soldiers who gave their . lives for king and country in the First World War. And . she did not duck another unhappy relic of the past: ‘Many Irish . migrants to Britain encountered discrimination and a lack of . appreciation. Happily, those days are now behind us.’ There . was humour, too. Harking back to the Olympics, the Queen drew warm . laughter as she added: ‘It took someone of Irish descent – Danny Boyle – . to get me to jump from a helicopter.’ In . his response, President Higgins, a former arts minister who writes his . own poetry, echoed the Queen’s sentiments. ‘Through conquest and . resistance, we have cast shadows on each other, but we have also gained . strength from one another as neighbours,’ he said. This . ‘joyous occasion’ would ‘celebrate the bonds of mutual understanding . between our two peoples, and the warm, enduring friendship on which we . have so happily embarked’. Martin McGuiness arriving at Windsor Castle last night for the State Banquet held by the Queen . Earlier, he had received the traditional honour of a carriage procession with a full escort from the Household Cavalry. Some Irish spectators wondered why the Queen and her guest were travelling in the Australian rather than the Irish State Coach. The Australian model, however, is the only one with heating. And Ireland was hardly under-represented. Every single one of the 161 horses on parade is actually Irish. The Household Division buys all its chargers there. Royal welcome: The Queen and Prince Philip with Mr Higgins and his wife Sabina pose for a photograph ahead of the State Banquet at Windsor Castle . After presenting the Irish Guards with a smart new coat for the enormous regimental mascot, Domhnall the wolfhound, Mr Higgins was ushered in to the castle for a private lunch and an intriguing exhibition of royal/Irish artefacts. These included Queen Victoria’s own journals about her trips to Ireland and a book of poems which Oscar Wilde presented to the future Edward VII. Much in evidence were the works of Irish-born George Bernard Shaw, including a fiery letter to the Spectator attacking the powers of censorship enjoyed (no longer) by the Monarch’s Lord Chamberlain. The historic sights are far from over. Mr McGuinness will be back here tomorrow for a Northern Irish reception and another meeting with the Queen. Later, he will join her at the Royal Albert Hall. It’s not so long ago that his old mob were trying to blow it up. Still, that’s progress for you.","Mr McGuinness boycotted Queen’s state visit to the Republic in 2011 .

"Alan Irvine is considering asking Ian Wright to give Saido Berahino one-on-one coaching to ensure his finishing gets even better. The West Bromwich Albion head coach played alongside Wright at Crystal Palace in the late 80s and can see similarities in Berahino. Wright went on to score nine times in 33 England games and for a period was Arsenal’s recorded scorer with 185 goals.

Alan Irvine (right) believes his former team-mate Ian Wright can help to improve Berahino's finishing skills . Berahino, 21, is now tipped to win his first England cap soon after having taken his Premier League tally this season to six with a fine goal against Manchester United last Monday. Irvine said: ‘I played with Ian at Crystal Palace and Wrighty had that energy and enthusiasm and wanted to run in behind people. Saido needs to keep on doing that. ‘Ian became better as he went on, he was one who stayed behind at the end of training and practised. Wright, pictured in 1996, scored goals for fun during his time at Arsenal and Crystal Palace . ‘I have spoken to Saido and said that Ian and I have chatted about him. If I feel Saido could do with a little bit of extra help, I might well (ask Wright to help out). I would be frightened what he might do with him! 'Saido has got great potential and at 21 Ian was raw. But he had real potential, what he did was kept on working at his game. ‘That’s where Saido could be, a top striker. But he needs to maintain this approach he has got at this moment. ‘The big danger would be if he gets distracted by anything else that goes on, or if he just loses that little bit of focus.’","Alan Irvine is weighing up the possibility of asking Ian Wright to help Saido Berahino's development .

"Controversial QPR footballer Joey Barton is taking his time writing an autobiography sure to cause the same kind of stir as the Roy Keane and Kevin Pietersen books this week. Barton has spent more than two years on the project — rejecting the manuscripts of two ghost writers and then parting company with publishers Penguin, who wanted to rush out the book for this year’s Christmas market before Barton was ready. The midfielder, whose desire to gain a wider sporting perspective saw him at the Leaders in Sport conference on Wednesday so he could listen to cycling innovator Sir David Brailsford, is now writing the life story himself. Joey Barton has spent more than two years on his autobiography, rejecting manuscripts from two ghosts . Barton is talking to other publishers after the fall-out with Penguin but is also examining digital self-publishing and releasing the contents chapter by chapter. Barton’s first ghost was Times sports writer Matthew Syed but it was felt he had portrayed his views of Barton rather than those of the footballer. Penguin then put forward author Jeff Hudson but his effort read more like a fictional novel to the former Newcastle player. Now, with the guidance of the head of humanities at Roehampton University, where Barton is studying for a degree in philosophy, the firebrand has completed nine chapters. The delay has allowed Barton to include his spell at Marseille plus QPR’s return to the top flight and his appearance on Question Time. Barton wants to create a stir with his book like Roy Keane and Kevin Pietersen have done this week . Such are the problems at troubled Leeds under owner Massimo Cellino that the English players and the large Italian contingent sit at separate tables for pre-match meals. The first half of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s England Commission report was derailed by the Premier League vetoing their chairman Anthony Fry being on the panel. But the second edition, to be announced tomorrow, has been notable for the warring bodies working closely for a change. PL chief Richard Scudamore even travelled to St George’s Park to spend three hours addressing the Commission. The big focus in part two is improving grass-roots facilities and coaching — to be piloted in Sheffield. It is due to be funded by the FA, the Premier League and the Government. Liverpool are following Manchester United and Manchester City by opening a commercial office in London. But while United are based in plush Mayfair, Liverpool have chosen, like City, to have their satellite operation near Euston railway station. This shortens the commute from the North West. UEFA 'pirates' snubbed . Jeffrey Webb has welcomed UEFA’s plan to play pre-season tournaments outside Europe . UEFA’s plan to play pre-season tournaments outside Europe, revealed by Sports Agenda, has been welcomed by Jeffrey Webb, the president of the CONCACAF federation that governs the favoured host countries in North America. But Tim Leiweke, the Los Angeles Galaxy owner who took David Beckham to the USA, is not in favour, claiming European clubs want to ‘take money out of that landscape’. Leiweke’s brother Tod, CEO of Tampa Bay Sports, also questioned whether it was a ‘pirate move’ by UEFA at Leaders in Sport. Meanwhile, Webb’s admirable stance on the racism scandal of Chelsea’s black youth coach Eddie Newton not getting near any managerial openings would have more credence if the FIFA anti-discrimination task force Webb heads had met in the last calendar year. ......................................................................... It makes sense for England to play home matches around the country when Wembley will only be half full for the visit of San Marino on Thursday. But that will have to wait until the FA negotiate a more flexible contract with Wembley from 2017. The FA are prioritising a full NFL franchise at Wembley, which could see England games played elsewhere. However, American football taking precedence over association football seems bizarre. Manchester City, whose women play Arsenal Ladies in the FA’s Continental Cup final at Wycombe a week today, are angry the game is being staged so close to London and aggravated by the FA not responding to their complaints. The FA say the venue was chosen months ago.","Joey Barton has spent more than two years on his book .

"England's Jack Wilshere can tap into advice from the greatest footballer in history after becoming the first client of a new sports agency in which Pele is a partner. Wilshere wears the No 10 shirt at Arsenal — the same as the Brazil legend — which helps explain why the sports management agency is called 10Ten Talent. The business has been formed by Terry Byrne, a former personal manager of David Beckham who also heads the England players’ representative business 1966. Jack Wilshere (C) was involved during England's 5-0 demolition of San Marino at Wembley . Brazil football legend Pele is a partner in the 10Ten Talent sports agency . When he plays for Arsenal, Wilshere (L) wears the same No 10 shirt as the Brazil icon . Byrne works with former Spurs director Paul Kemsley, who manages Pele’s commercial rights business. He said: ‘Obviously Jack can’t be mentioned as being anywhere near the same league as Pele, but hopefully one day he will.’ Byrne, who has assured both the FA and the players that there will be no conflict with his 1966 duties, has also signed up former England manager Glenn Hoddle. The two have maintained links since they were both at Chelsea. England and Wasps rugby wing Christian Wade is also joining 10Ten, which doesn’t want to concentrate solely on football. The 10Ten agency has also signed up Wasps and England rugby star Christian Wade . UEFA chief executive Gianni Infantino somehow claims the qualifying process for an enlarged Euro 2016 with 24 clubs is more ‘interesting’ and has created a ‘whole new dynamic with some amazing results’. It would be difficult to find anyone not wearing a UEFA blazer who would agree with Infantino after watching last night’s San Marino debacle. British swimming chief David Sparkes created a splash last year when he told Sportsmail that Tom Daley was in danger of putting the cart before the horse with his commercial and media activities, which his Chinese rivals would never do. Tom Daley, speaking at the Leaders Sport Business Summit, is bidding for gold at the Rio Olympic Games . But Daley now says he has a ‘really good relationship’ with Sparkes, whom he credits with helping his move to London and training in the Olympic Park’s Aquatics Centre as well as setting up the Daley diving academies. Tom says he’s training five hours a day, six days a week for his gold-medal bid in Rio.

United in FFP spotlight . The Financial Fair Play battleground in the Premier League is likely to become considerably more messy after a special summit at UEFA’s headquarters in Nyon on Monday. Clubs with huge debts such as Manchester United might find themselves under the microscope during the next stage of FFP, which is due to be discussed at the meeting. UEFA president Michel Platini has gathered all those involved in FFP — including Manchester City, who have had £50m worth of sanctions imposed for their overspending — to talk about how to refine the controversial legislation. Heavily in-debt Manchester United could find themselves under scrutiny at new FFP discussions . UEFA chief Gianni Infantino has confirmed that the issue of debt is expected to be raised again . UEFA chief executive Gianni Infantino confirmed at Leaders in Sport that the debt issue may be on the agenda next week and the European Clubs Association also say they expect it to be raised. Manchester City will stress their zero-debt status and push the case for sustainable investment spending rather than try to shift the spotlight on to their Manchester neighbours, who still owe £350m from the Glazer family’s leveraged purchase of the club. Nevertheless City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak did highlight the differences between the two clubs when he pointedly said: ‘We have a sustainable project. We have zero debt. We don’t pay a penny to service any debt.’ FA chairman Greg Dyke has been ordered to return a watch given to him by Brazil's Football Federation .

But with the ECB waiting to see what KP says first, Moores provided a bland overview of last summer’s cricket, avoiding the exiled batsman.

"In the midst of a foul-mouthed tirade in a London cinema, Tyson Fury has struck a side bet with Dereck Chisora as to who will win their world heavyweight title eliminator in Manchester on Saturday week. Whether the bet is for £10,000, £100,000 or winner takes all the purse was unclear amid the four-letter mayhem. What is certain is that British boxing has taken its first steps down from the honourable peak reached with Carl Froch's victory over George Groves in front of 80,000 people at Wembley. VIDEO Scroll down for Dereck Chisora and Tyson Fury make £100,000 side bet . Verbal sparring: Dereck Chisora and Tyson Fury go head-to-head at a press conference ahead of their fight .

Close up: Chisora and Fury stare each other down as they shake on their side bet . Fury's descent into the f-word, the c-word, the s-word and every other initial word imaginable was accompanied by a gutter of gross sexual references and insults. In most other sports the Manchester giant of the prize ring would be facing either a ban or a heavy fine for bringing the game into disrepute. Boxing tends to turn a blind eye to what is considered to be promotional activity, as it has done with similar outbursts at previous events during the build-up for this particular encounter. At one, in Manchester, Fury was busy swearing and turning over tables. The stage is set: Fury and Chisora attend a press conference at a west London cinema . Londoner Chisora managed to remain largely restrained in the face of unpleasant mocking of his manhood but was the first to provoke a wager. He shouted: 'I bet you 10 grand I knock you out.' Fury responded: '10 grand is chump money to me. I give the kids that to go to the shops. Make it winner takes all... or at least 100 grand.' Chisora charged forward and said: 'OK, let's shake on it.' Fighting talk: Chisora and Fury exchanged insults during a press conference and made a side bet worth £10,000 to the winner . Foul language: Fury was not to concerned about his words as he traded insults with Chisora . The clasping of hands was as near as Fury came to civilised behaviour but was still an ugly, tugging and shoving affair. British Boxing Board of Control regulations forbid fighters from betting on the sport with bookmakers but side stakes are permitted. Chisora lost his personal wager with David Haye and after being knocked out at West Ham's Upton Park stadium paid the £20,000 to charity. As the profanities continued, Chisora said: 'I must apologise on behalf of my opponent for his language.' Fury gave this angry retort: 'I don't give a f*** how many women and children are in the audience. We're getting near to the fight and I'm in fight mode, kill mode.' That is just a sample of how unsavoury it was. Each promised to knock the other out and be the one to go on to challenge Wladimir Klitschko for the WBO heavyweight title. That could be sometime in the making, although whether the high class Klitschko camp will want to involve themselves in such shenanigans has to be open to question. Promoter Frank Warren, who is also Chisora's manager, has been going to considerable lengths to sell the July 26 spectacle in Manchester at a time when the run-up to this rematch has been overshadowed by the World Cup finals. But he moved to end quickly this last head-to-head meeting in London. Warren said: 'It's not easy getting all of this together with so much interest in the World Cup but we're getting there.' This fracas in a west London cinema was not of his making. Whether or not it boosts ticket sales and television subscriptions, it is not much help for the image of boxing.

"So much golf history has been written at Royal Liverpool it seems only appropriate that a landmark day for the European game has now moved firmly into view. If Rory McIlroy can keep mind and sinew together in the final round of the 143rd Open Championship, he will become the first player from this continent to win three different majors since the Masters was founded in 1934. Even the greats like Sir Nick Faldo and Seve Ballesteros only won two of the four, so to add the Claret Jug to the US Open he won in 2011 and the USPGA Championship the following year would be truly impressive. He would then have the chance to complete the career Grand Slam - something only five golfers have achieved - at the Masters next year at the age of just 25. VIDEO Scroll down to watch post-round reaction from Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods . Majestic: Rory McIlroy saved the best for last with an eagle on the 18th which opened six-shot lead . 'That would create a little hype going into Augusta next year, wouldn't it?' said McIlroy, smiling. 'That would put me in really illustrious company. But I'm taking nothing for granted. I came from seven back myself with a round to go to win the PGA at Wentworth this year, so I know it can be done, and I cannot afford to get ahead of myself.' Just like Tiger Woods before him, McIlroy is so good that when he plays his best, the rest are playing for second place. It was here in 2006 that Woods underlined that point and now McIlroy has the chance to put the finishing touches to what has been a 54-hole masterclass in all aspects of his craft. The fact it has been delivered on a links course only adds to the achievement. Remember Rory's frustrated words after being blown away at Royal St George's in 2011, or being demoralised at Muirfield last year? The previous best McIlroy had ever managed going into the final round of an Open was nine shots behind. Here, after adding a 68 to his two opening rounds of 66, he will begin with a mammoth six-stroke advantage. Fans' favourite: Rory McIlroy makes his way to the 18th before finishing with a magnificent eagle three . The Northern Irishman has shown emphatically what he has learned regarding this form of the game, and while he undoubtedly got lucky with the draw over the first two rounds, you still have to possess the shots to be able to take advantage. Mental strength never used to be one of his best qualities but the manner in which he lengthened his stride over the closing holes, after Rickie Fowler had caught him at one point, was positively Woods-like. Indeed, Tiger comparisons abound, and there's no greater compliment than that. Only two men have won three majors at a younger age than Rory since the Masters was founded in 1934, and they just happen to be Tiger and Jack. Only Tiger has ever won three majors by seven shots or more but, having won his first two by eight, that's certainly within McIlroy's compass. Like all the great ones he saved the best for last, and a towering drive and five-iron to the par-five 18th that finished just 11 feet from the hole. That second shot from 237 yards was as pure a golf shot as you will ever see and when he duly rolled in the putt, it meant he had played the last five holes in the following: birdie-par-eagle-bogey-eagle. He is now 11 under for the par fives alone. Contender: American Rickie Fowler is six shots adrift of McIlroy . Weather warning: Electrical storms were forecast for Saturday afternoon but they never materialised . He's not quite home and dry yet, as he said. Greg Norman once lost a six-shot final-round lead at the Masters and Rory lost one of four strokes there himself. Fowler began six in arrears yesterday and caught him after 13 holes. So he will have plenty of reference points today to remind him that the job is not done. All the thousands of brave souls who donned their waterproofs and ignored the terrible weather forecast were regally rewarded, for this was a fantastic day's play. Thankfully, the bad stuff stayed away until just after the final putt dropped and a scoring festival broke out. The nightmare scenario when you're owning a four-stroke halfway lead is a rain-sodden links, no wind, and a host of aggressive shotmakers in the rear-view mirror. For a while it was Sergio Garcia and Dustin Johnson who took dead aim to make inroads into McIlroy's lead. Then came a foe who threatened to become a familiar one when he defeated McIlroy for the Quail Hollow Championship three years ago with a birdie at the first play-off hole to claim his maiden PGA Tour title. Fowler disappeared thereafter but a rebuilt swing under the wise tutelage of Butch Harmon looks to be paying dividends. The putter, though, remains his most potent weapon, and he wielded it to such deadly effect he achieved parity with McIlroy at the 13th. Hats off: Could Sergio Garcia mount a challenge on the final day at Hoylake? Struggle: Woods, the 14-time major champion shot a 73 to sit three over and in 58th place . The problem with gunslingers, however, is they're prone to shoot themselves in the foot. Johnson did it with three successive bogeys to close the front nine. Garcia missed a tiddler that stalled his momentum. As for Fowler, having climbed level with McIlroy, he promptly bogeyed three of his next four holes. McIlroy began tentatively with a bogey from the middle of the first fairway, but this is where experi-ence kicks in. He would have known that after two wonderful 66s it was almost inevitable things wouldn't go quite so smoothly for a third successive day. 'Even when Rickie drew level I remained comfortable,' he said. 'I knew I had to be patient and there were some holes coming up where I could take advantage.' Everything changed as Fowler's rough patch coincided with inspired golf from McIlroy. It was a 30-foot birdie putt at the 14th, one of the tough par fours on the back nine, that got him going. At the 16th there was a three-shot swing, as McIlroy found the green in two and rolled in another long one, while Fowler was running up an untidy bogey. As he came down the 18th the 7,000 spectators sitting in the first wraparound stand in Open history rose to acclaim Europe's history man (Scottish-born Tommy Armour won three different majors in 1927-31, but had become an American citizen when he won them). 'I wanted to give them something to cheer, because it's a pleasure to play in front of people who are giving you so much support,' he said, and he delivered. And so one of the great achievements in the annals of the European game has moved within touching distance. On the banks of the Dee estuary, on an afternoon of promised sunshine, it looks like we're about to see thrilling confirmation that McIlroy is fit to rank alongside any contemporary you care to mention as the leading sportsman of his time.","McIlroy carded two eagles and a birdie in his final three holes at Hoylake .

"The Garcia report into World Cup vote corruption - now in possession of the FIFA ethics chiefs - is understood to be far more damning of the bidding countries than expected. It’s understood Michael Garcia details the huge amount of money involved in allegedly attempting to buy votes in those flawed 2018 and 2022 ballots - with the figures even bigger than those revealed in previous newspaper investigations. And the persistent rumours about the 2022 decision in particular are enough for bookmakers Coral to fancifully make Qatar odds-on to be stripped of the 2022 World Cup. This will add yet more pressure on FIFA to make Garcia’s report public with German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, head of the adjudicatory chamber of the ethics committee, only prepared to make an interim statement next month with no commitment from Zurich over whether the full 430-page document will ever see the light of day because of witness confidentiality issues. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Michael Hershman: FIFA needs a change of leadership . Sepp Blatter's FIFA film only took £150,000 at the box office . UEFA president Michel Platini has led the complaints from inside the FIFA ExCo for at least the findings and recommendations be published. And Michael Hershman, founder of anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, said at the Securing Sport conference on Monday that FIFA will continue to be ridiculed as long as it keeps Garcia’s findings under wraps. Ironically, Securing Sport is a lavish Qatar-funded event at London’s Lancaster House where Tuesday’s speakers include German football great Franz Beckenbauer, who was banned from football for 90 days for refusing to co-operate with Garcia — which he eventually did. Meanwhile, FIFA president Sepp Blatter’s vanity project - the FIFA history film United Passions - has taken only around £150,000 at the box office. Blatter ensured that FIFA spent £16million on it. You need to say something special to create any impression during the current sports conference season when so much tosh is spoken. And David Howman, director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency did so at Securing Sport by claiming 25 per of world sport had been infiltrated by organised crime – albeit mainly below elite level. However, Howman wouldn’t say which sports or where.

"Graham Dorrans remembers the moment vividly. He was at West Bromwich Albion’s Birmingham Road training ground when the phone call came that would put his life on hold. His baby daughter was in hospital with suspected meningitis. ‘It was pre-season and we’d been training,’ recalls Dorrans. ‘I got a shout that Ava had been taken into hospital but my doctor told me it was nothing to worry about so it was a real shock when I got there and saw her. It was clear it was serious. She was three months old, so fragile.’ It had been just two years since he and wife Yvonne had lost their second child, Logan, to stillbirth. Was this really happening again? Graham Dorrans, pictured playing against Manchester United, has spoken of his daughter's illness . West Brom midfielder Dorrans poses with his family - including Ava (left) who had to battle against meningitis . ‘Seeing your child like that is the worst thing in life,’ says Dorrans. ‘It’s horrible, something you never forget. Nothing else matters but you feel so helpless. Thankfully, babies are tough.’ After an agonising two weeks of intensive care and attention, Ava pulled through. Indeed those fighting qualities mean that Ava, fully recovered, is the livewire of the household and she is happy to share the limelight with older sister Leah, 12, and the latest Dorrans addition, baby brother Austyn. ‘She’s as bright as a button,’ says Dorrans. ‘She’s two-and-a-half now and running around everywhere. It’s lovely to come home from football to relax and see her and the other two playing so well. It’s great hearing her little laugh around the place and she’s got her big sister doing everything for her. ‘The whole experience of what we have been through has definitely brought us closer together as a family unit and you appreciate every moment that little bit more.’ The gratitude felt by Dorrans and his wife to those who cared for Ava is expressed in Yvonne’s continued push to raise funds for SANDS neonatal charity and Meningitis Now: running marathons and sky-diving from 10,000 feet. ‘I just go to watch,’ says Dorrans. ‘Besides, I’m scared of heights.’ The sense of joie de vivre in their Sutton Coldfield home has been aided by Austyn’s arrival. Now seven months old, he is already accustomed to supporting dad; resplendent in Albion kit, he proved a lucky omen on his first game against Cardiff City in March when Dorrans scored in a 3-3 draw. West Brom 2-2 Sunderland . Southampton 0-0 West Brom . Swansea 3-0 West Brom . West Brom 0-2 Everton . Tottenham 0-1 West Brom . West Brom 4-0 Burnley . Liverpool 2-1 West Brom . West Brom 2-2 Manchester United . Dorrans and family spend their precious time together at the local safari park or the occasional trip to Alton Towers but, like any footballer, out on the pitch is where Dorrans finds his escape. He has been at Albion since 2008 and it’s fair to say he has had his share of ups and downs. An often underrated midfield talent with an eye for goal, he was signed by Tony Mowbray, flourished under Roberto Di Matteo before playing for Roy Hodgson, fell out of favour under Steve Clarke then was given a fresh chance by Pepe Mel. Now under Alan Irvine, he is an ever-present and part of Scotland’s promising European Championship campaign. ‘When things happen like with Ava, football is the last thing on your mind, nothing else matters. Unfortunately, it coincided with Steve Clarke not wanting to pick me,’ remembers Dorrans. ‘Not having a game to look forward to, it was a difficult time. A few clubs came in and I came very close to leaving but the deals didn’t go through. Pepe then gave me a fresh chance, I had a run of games, signed a new deal and Alan Irvine has kept faith in me. It’s been great to get back playing.’ Scotland international Dorrans has been an ever-present for West Brom so far this season . Dorrans, pictured celebrating with team-mate Saido Berahino, scored in his side's 4-0 win against Burnley . In those frustrating times Dorrans sought advice in the shape of coaches Dean Kiely and Keith Downing and drew support in the shape of team-mate Nicolas Anelka, who left the club after being banned for his quenelle gesture which was deemed anti-Semitic. ‘Nic was always someone who said I should be playing and when someone of his ability and calibre says that about you it gives you a lift,’ he says. ‘I was sorry to see him go. Obviously circumstances dictated it but, despite what is said about him, Nic was always a nice, calm guy around the place.’ Despite an inauspicious start this season, Albion have started to find their rhythm and results are mirroring performances, as reflected in Monday’s 2-2 draw with Manchester United. ‘Alan Irvine has brought a real freshness to the club,’ says Dorrans. ‘He’s very thorough. Whether we are playing a lower league team in the cup or Liverpool, he treats everyone with the same respect, we have a gameplan for every opposition and he’s made training enjoyable with plenty of variation. He’s serious about what he does but we can have a laugh with him too.’ West Brom ace Dorrans could come up against childhood friend James McArthur (right) at the weekend . Irvine had to rebuild Albion’s squad in the summer but managed to keep the core group and nurture talent such as England U21 striker Saido Berahino. ‘There’s a few of us such as Chris Brunt and James Morrison who have been here a while and that has helped the transition and the squad to gel quickly but credit to Saido. He has worked really hard and is going to be a great player. He’s already showing what he could achieve and hopefully there’s a lot more goals to come from him.’ This weekend, Dorrans faces childhood friend James McArthur of Crystal Palace. ‘We know each other well from schoolboy days and we roomed together with Scotland. He’s a good player and a good friend but I hope he has a stinker on Saturday. ‘Seriously though, every week is an exciting test in the Premier League, you’re up against some of the best players and the best teams in Europe but, as against United, we’ve matched many of them. We’ve got a good team developing. There’s a freshness and togetherness about the place, like a family bond and we feel we can get stronger.’ After his experience, that’s something Dorrans can vouch for.

"Forget the disappearing act in the semi-final. Never mind the stats-men telling us that the only time he touched the ball in Holland’s penalty area  was when he got lucky with his middle-of-the-goal  spot-kick in the sudden-death shoot-out. Let’s hear it for that team talk. Follow the leader: Lionel Messi (centre) speaks to his Argentina team-mates before extra time . In their premature desperation to proclaim Lionel Messi as the greatest footballer of all time, the Argentinian’s sycophants are citing not the way he played for 120 minutes but what he had to say to his amigos between full-time and extra-time. Look at the pictures, they protest. See how he takes over from manager Alejandro Sabella come the crunch. For heaven’s sake, spare us. Spare him, also. Because they do their own idol a disservice. Not least by ignoring that it was Javier Mascherano -  the man who really did most to squeeze Argentina through to Sunday’s World Cup Final against Germany -  who picked up the motivation mantle after the Dutch had threatened through the first 15 minutes of the additional half-hour. Messi was literally Little Leo on this occasion. A peripheral figure in a match which, while important in its result, was monumental only by the scale of its tedium. That does not mean Messi is anything less than an exceptional footballer, perhaps the finest of his generation. But if he is to be elevated to the pantheon of Pele, Maradona, Garrincha and di Stefano it will take something other than a spot of tub-thumping in the huddle. Stepping up to the plate: Javier Mascherano led the team talk at half-time during extra time . At his shimmering best, Messi is a delight to behold. As a shooting star in the highest firmament of the club game he may well be entitled to begrudge Cristiano Ronaldo being given his turn as world footballer of the year just because he himself had won that honour so often. As it stands at this moment Messi  needs a final-winning spectacular against Germany  in the Maracana.  Not least because he has disappointed in his previous World Cups. That will sound severe to Messi’s legion of admirers but it is only the most exacting judgement which makes any ultimate accolade worth receiving. This is a challenge to which Messi is capable of rising and it will be sad for him, as well as unfortunate for us all, if suspicions that he may be less than totally fit for the grandest occasion of his life prove well-founded. That way? Messi gestures during the World Cup semi-final between Argentina and Holland . VIDEO When Messi is on form - highlights . There did appear to be  a heaviness in the legs and perhaps a favouring of one of them against the Dutch. Also, a hint of fleshiness about the jowels hinted at possible limitations on his training. Certainly, the crisp finishing which had carried Argentina through the earlier stages of the tournament was missing. Although it has to be said that those four goals tended to mask performances which fell rather short of virtuoso splendour. It may well be that the brutal tackling which has provided  a nasty undercurrent to Brazil 2014  is taking its toll of Messi. Chilling out: Messi sits down during a training session near Belo Horizonte on Thursday ahead of the final . If so, while the effects may not be as drastic as the crippling of  Neymar, they could be debilitating nonetheless. If that is the case, the heart goes out to him. If not, does he deserve as yet to be lacing up the boots in celestial company? Not unless he pulls his socks up on Sunday. Jubilation: Argentina players celebrate after defeating Holland in a penalty shoot-out on Wednesday . VIDEO Team Profile: Argentina highlights . So it’s goodnight from him, the Alan Hansen the twitter trolls love to hate. And it’s goodnight from him, the Alan Hansen whose judgement the more considered BBC viewers seriously respect. The TV football pundit who divides public opinion more sharply than any other is leaving the building for the last time on Sunday night. And it's goodnight from me: Alan Hansen will retire as the BBC's leading television football pundit this Sunday . Hansen made his final appearance before the Match of the Day cameras in May. Quite why, when he is not yet 60, is a matter between himself and his Auntie Beeb. He will disappear from our screens for good – well, with the probable exceptions of occasional guest appearances – when the lights go out in that temporary glass studio on Copacabana beach. Not a bad way to go out, a World Cup Final in Brazil. The BBC are making a fuss about it which has included a documentary programme. Nice of them. But switching off his broadcasting career of 20-odd years does not mark the most significant retirement of Hansen’s life. Most of the younger tele-generation may not realise it but this man’s most profound analysis of the game was expressed on the pitch, when he was one of the most cerebral players of his era. Back in the day: Hansen (left) pictured with Des Lynam (centre) and Sir Trevor Brooking in the 1990s . Having cut his Scottish teeth on helping Partick Thistle win the First Division title, and with it promotion to the Premier League, Hansen’s  made his lifetime career move to Liiverpool. The apparently overt elegance and laid-back style which would come to irritate the detractors among his television audience were a source of enormous reassurance to his Anfield team-mates. They called him 'Jockey' but they would have been better sticking to his original nick-name 'Stretch'. That referred to the languorous manner in which he would extend one of those long legs to coax the ball away from opposing forwards and thereby snuff out danger with what looked like effortless ease. Consider the importance of that classy contribution to a golden age of Liverpool domination both at home and in Europe. Euro glory: Hansen (right), Graeme Souness (left) and Kenny Dalglish hold up the European Cup in 1981 . Hansen won three European Cup winner’s medals. He helped Liverpool to eight English league titles and two FA Cups, which included the classic domestic double of 1986 to which he captained them under the management of Kenny Dalglish. To all that, he can add our League Cups, one European Super Cup and six FA Charity Shields. To some extent his abilities went less recognised in his own country. He played only 26 times for Scotland and was  dropped from the ill-fated squad for Mexico 86. In part that related to the formidable centre-back pairing of Alex McLeish and Willie Miller which Sir Alex Ferguson had forged at Aberdeen. International duty: Hansen pictured playing for Scotland at the 1982 World Cup Finals in Spain . It may have had something to do, also, with his seemingly aloof demeanour. That was at its most evident after he won the ball and proceeded to build attacks from the back with his calm, unhurried, perceptive passes. If Scotland ever did produce a Bobby Moore,  It was Alan Hansen. Enough said. Turn off the lights. And a very good night to him.","Mascherano was the man who picked up the motivation mantle against Holland in the World Cup semi-final on Wednesday .

"Here's an anecdote that tells you a little of what you need to know about Bob Torrance, unquestionably one of the best coaches this country has produced and who passed away in his sleep on Friday aged 82. A few years ago the Association of Golf Writers were keen to give him an outstanding services award. Only trouble was the AGW dinner, where the award is given out, is the social highlight of Open week, attended by over 300 people and Bob didn’t like giving speeches or being singled out for attention. Eventually we persuaded him to attend and he duly looked petrified when it was his turn to stand up. He uttered about 30 words but it was so clearly spoken from the heart, he said more in that time than plenty of other speakers say in 20 minutes. He was given a standing ovation. Tribute: Tiger Woods wears a black ribbon in memory of Bob Torrence, who died on Friday . Memory: Darren Clarke wears a black ribbon in tribute to Bob Torrence, who died on Friday . On the practice ground, you couldn’t shut him up, of course. His idea of heaven was nattering away for hours on end about the golf swing. Quite honestly his Scottish accent was so strong I struggled to understand what he was saying half the time but I still liked listening to him. In Hoylake yesterday, players who knew him, from Darren Clarke to Tiger Woods, paid their own small tribute by wearing black ribbons on their caps. Bob produced one fine European golfer and Ryder Cup captain in Sam Torrance, coached many other good tour pros including another Ryder Cup player and skipper in Paul McGinley, and one undeniably great golfer in Padraig Harrington. Well done, son: Bob Torrance (right) celebrates with Sam after Europe win the Ryder Cup at the Belfry in 2002 . Legend: Bob Torrance helped many players including major champion Padraig Harrington . When they teamed up in 1998, Harrington had a wonderful short game but it would be kind to describe his long game as average. Over the next decade they worked so hard to transform his mediocre swing into one that delivered no fewer than three majors. ‘It wouldn’t have happened without Bob, absolutely not,’ said Harrington. ‘He was like a father to me.’McGinley took time out from a holiday in Portugal to pen a heartfelt missive. ‘I feel blessed to have known Bob and to have had him as my coach since 1992,’ he reflected. ‘Not only was he a world-class coach, a fact recognised across the game, he was also one of my favourite people in life.’ But it was Harrington who summed up how the golfing world should remember him. ‘His passing is not to be mourned,’ said the Irishman. ‘He did this game a great service. He loved it and whoever came into contact with him walked away with a better experience. Isn’t that a fabulous way to go out of this world?’ Our condolences to his wife June and Sam.

"CURSE OF CARRINGTON . More worrying news from United’s training ground. Not only did Radamel Falcao pick up an injury there on Friday, Phil Jones and Ashley Young succumbed to the curse on Saturday. Falcao had a session of treatment on his thigh on Sunday morning but was subsequently declared unfit. Radamel Falcao trains on Friday but later suffered an injury which forced him out of Sunday's match . Phil Jones (left) was among those training at Carrington on Friday ahead of the match against Chelsea . DO YOUR JOB . There will be much talk about the logic of Rafael da Silva marking the much taller Didier Drogba for Chelsea’s goal and rightly so. Robin van Persie would have cleared Drogba’s header, though, had been standing tight to the front post as he was supposed to be. Instead, the United striker got sucked towards the ball and that was all Drogba needed to give Chelsea the lead. Luckily for Van Persie, he was able to redeem itself. Didier Drogba rises high in the box to score Chelsea's opening goal against United at Old Trafford . FERGIE TIME . The United match programme was pushing sales of Sir Alex Ferguson’s reissued autobiography with what appeared to be little more than a free advert for the great man’s book. We await any reference by United to the recent autobiography published by former Old Trafford captain Roy Keane. Sir Alex Ferguson (centre) watches the Premier League match between United and Crystal Palace last month . BEST MEMORIES . Still with the match programme, how about this for a piece of nostalgia from the George Best era? Writing a postcard to his parents from a United tour of Zurich in 1964, 17-year-old George tells them: 'The weather is brilliant, the food is not too good and the girls are fabulous.' Former Manchester United player George Best poses for the camera during his time at the club . THIS CITY IS OURS . Manchester City fans like to taunt their neighbours by pointing to the number of United fans who actually live in London. Despite chaos on the west coast line from the capital on Sunday, though, Old Trafford was still pretty much full by kick-off. The scene at London Euston earlier on Sunday morning as supporters try to travel to Manchester . DEADLY DIDIER . Drogba’s record against United is actually quite modest. Just four goals in 22 games. However he does score important goals against them, having previously won Chelsea an FA Cup final and scoring a goal here in April 2010 that effectively won Chelsea the title. Drogba celebrates after putting Chelsea ahead against United in Sunday's Premier League clash . LINEKER HAS HIS SAY . United showed impressive resilience to claim a late point, and their never-say-die attitude clearly made an impression on Gary Lineker, who tweeted after the match: ‘I don’t think Manchester United are a million miles away and will qualify for next season’s Champions League.’ The point keeps Louis van Gaal’s side in eighth position in the Premier League table. This time last season, United were also eighth, but with one more point (14).","Radamel Falcao had treatment on his thigh on Sunday but missed out .

"Peter Schmeichel says Manchester United’s failure to pick a settled back four will cost them in the long-run this season. Marcos Rojo partnered Chris Smalling in the middle of the United defence for the 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Sunday and it was their eighth different pairing in nine games. Schmeichel played in the successful Manchester United sides of the 1990s and with centre back pairings of Steve Bruce and Gary Pallister and then later Jaap Stam and Ronny Johnsen. Peter Schmeichel was on Match of the Day 2 and was critical of United's defence . The former United No 1 was full of praise for goalkeeper David de Gea but says he needs stability infront of him. Speaking to the BBC as part of his Match of the Day 2 analysis, Schmeichel said: ‘On Sunday, De Gea played exceptionally well and was trying to bring some sort of stability to their defence with the way he controlled his six-yard box and came for crosses. ‘But, whoever is in Van Gaal's defence, he does not seem to have enough commanding players who can stand on their own two feet. Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo played at the back together for the first time this season . ‘He needs a centre-half who can take the team by the scruff of the neck and say ""this is what we need to do"". That player is not in their squad yet. ‘In my time at United, we always had defenders who were leaders and who took responsibility. For various reasons, that is not the case at the moment.’ Schmeichel was full of praise for David de Gea and his performances this season . Schmeichel played at the back with the likes of Jaap Stam during his career at Old Trafford . United have conceded 13 goals in their nine league games so far, and Schmeichel believes De Gea’s form is the only positive Van Gaal can take from his side’s defending this season. He added: ‘He has made some stunning saves against Sunderland and Everton, as well as against Chelsea to deny Hazard moments before Didier Drogba put them ahead.’","Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo were United's eighth different centre back pairing this season .

"A goal to restore some Manchester United belief, a goal to stop Chelsea turning the Barclays Premier League into their own private show. They will be thankful for this much further afield than Old Trafford. It was, it must be said, something of a throwback moment. Only seconds remaining and the ball hits the back of the net at the Stretford End so hard that it could have burst. In the car parks, those who had abandoned their seats — abandoned hope — minutes earlier must have felt the ground tremble a little beneath their feet. This time, the cause was a little different of course. Over the years, United have scored late goals to win titles and cup ties. There was a period when it wasn’t a case of wondering whether United would equalise but whether they would go on and win, too. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Robin van Persie takes his shirt off as he celebrates his late equaliser against Chelsea on Sunday . Van Persie makes no mistake as he fires home to score a late equaliser for United at Old Trafford . Here, it wasn’t about that. Not this time. This was a goal — struck purely from the laces of Robin van Persie — that gave United a little of their self-respect back. The point it earned them probably won’t matter particularly at the end of the season but if it brings with it some momentum then it could prove priceless. This was a fixture that United supporters had been eyeing with some trepidation for a while. The first ‘big’ game of the season. There was a question, nervously asked, that if Swansea, Leicester and MK Dons could beat Louis van Gaal’s team then just what could the leaders of the Premier League do here? So, yes, this was not so much about the here and now but the future. There may have been some fortune about the free-kick awarded to them when Branislav Ivanovic tangled with Angel di Maria down the left side, which resulted in a red card for a second booking. But the way Marouane Fellaini arrived to power a header towards goal said as much for his own restored confidence as it did United’s conviction that they could take something. Van Persie’s finish, meanwhile, was reminiscent of better days. Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic is sent off for a second booking towards the end of the match . United's Angel Di Maria lies on the ground in pain after a late challenge by Ivanovic at Old Trafford . United’s centre forward had been poor prior to that moment, as he has been for much of the season. Twice he had failed to beat Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in one-on-one situations while he had also been partly culpable when Didier Drogba headed Chelsea in to the lead early in the second half, drifting off the near post a fraction before the ball arrived. Van Persie remains some way from his best. With Wayne Rooney back from suspension for next week’s Manchester derby and Radamel Falcao expected to be fit, he may not even start. His assessment of his team after the final whistle  was nevertheless interesting. ‘In my opinion we are better every day,’ he said. ‘In training and if you look at games you can see we are comfy on the ball and we are playing better.’ Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini (right) chases down the ball with opponent Ivanovic . Van Persie (left) attempts to score past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois but misses . Had United been playing a full-strength Chelsea  they may have suffered. The league leaders missed injured striker Diego Costa desperately. Drogba fought manfully at the point of Chelsea’s attack but the absence of Costa’s pace served to undo much of the terrific approach play of Eden Hazard and the Brazilian Oscar. United were missing players too, though, and the way Van Gaal dragged improved performances from Fellaini and young Adnan Januzaj said something about him and indeed the way his team are finally beginning to understand the principles he likes to talk so much about. Fellaini was terrific on Sunday. He looked focused, athletic and energetic. He used to be like that at Everton before he succumbed to the ‘big club syndrome’ that similarly afflicted his manager David Moyes last season. Didier Drogba rises above Rafael to fire his header towards goal and score the opener for Chelsea . Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj (right) looks to take the ball past Chelsea's Cesc Fabregas . Here he worked manfully to stifle Cesc Fabregas and it worked. Chelsea’s playmaker will rarely have a quieter game. The Belgian was similarly influential at the other end of the field, though, and may well have played his way in to next Sunday’s derby team. Chelsea will have gone home disappointed. Denied victory by Frank Lampard’s late goal at City last month and by Van Persie’s strike here, Jose Mourinho knows that his team’s lead over the champions City could already be 11 points. As it is, it is a much more modest six. Mourinho’s team have the look of the best in the country at the moment. There is an energy and dexterity about the Chelsea midfield that can appear irresistible at times. On Sunday, though, they were matched — if not bettered — for long periods by United. For Van Gaal and his team, that represents progress. Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"They could have lost Daniel Sturridge it would not have been irreparable. Jordan Henderson the same; maybe even Steven Gerrard. But not him. The moment it became plain that Luis Suarez’s future in English football was untenable, handling life without a player who close to propelled Liverpool to a first league title of the modern era, was going to take all the skill Brendan Rodgers and his boardroom financiers could muster. The same task has eaten up three managers in a year at Tottenham Hotspur, and they are still no further forward. Managers will say that it is good business to lose one stellar name and rebuild a team. Yes, but there are exceptions. When that player is so far above the rest it makes compensatory dealing close to impossible. That is what Tottenham have found, losing Gareth Bale. Liverpool are now facing the same painful facts post-Suarez. Mario Balotelli and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers back in training the morning after the night before . Balotelli  on the ball on Thursday morning - but it was on Wednesday night that Liverpool could have done with him stepping up . Balotelli once again proved to Liverpool fans that he is not the answer to the problem created by Luis Suarez's departure . Trudging off, head down, said everything you needed to know about Balotelli's 45 minutes against Real Madrid . It is not that their buys have been so bad: they just don’t amount to one Suarez. Tottenham’s aren’t wholesale duds either. They just can’t add up to the match-winning quality of Bale at his best. Liverpool could have restructured around the loss of, say, Sturridge. He is a good player, among the best strikers in the Premier League, but with £30m to spend, Liverpool could have made the necessary improvements to the team, while retaining the talent that made it all tick. Suarez would have continued winning and defining matches, while the likes of Adam Lallana settled in. That is how it works. Luke Shaw was a fine player for Southampton, but not so influential that he was irreplaceable. And with the inflated fee from Manchester United, Southampton were able to make upgrades throughout the group. But Balotelli soon angered the home support and guaranteed a few more headlines by swapping shirts with Pepe . Balotelli and Pepe exchanged jerseys as the players made their way down the tunnel for half-time . The 'Why Always Me' top - while playing for Manchester City three years ago - was another shirt that landed Balotelli in hot water . Balotelli's heat map against Real Madrid didn't cover him in glory . Most Premier League managers endorse this policy of renewal. Most  have little choice, really. Swansea City lose Scott Sinclair but can invest in the likes of Chico Flores and Michu and have loose change for the sundries. Sinclair was good but not so good that his loss could not be more than compensated for by the addition of others. Any other Liverpool player, perhaps even the aging, talismanic Gerrard, would fit into that category, too. Just not Suarez. Manchester United could cover the absence of Jaap Stam, Ruud van Nistelrooy, even David Beckham: but not Cristiano Ronaldo. Too good. Too special. Too unique. Not that Liverpool had too many options once Suarez had bitten Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. Banned from club football until late October – he will play for Barcelona for the first time this weekend and, initially, his suspension was from all form of football activity, so it was thought he would not be back that quickly – his status in the English game made it close to impossible for him to continue. Liverpool’s mistake was in not learning from Tottenham’s expensive agonies. Buying in bulk was not the solution. They needed to pick off specific problem areas with individuals of the highest quality. At Anfield on Wednesday they had nobody operating at the level of Ronaldo, James Rodriguez, Isco, Toni Kroos or Karim Benzema. They had the notch down; the wannabes. Think of how Chelsea improved this summer. Diego Costa. Bang. Cesc Fabregas. Bang. Marquee names. Major players. Liverpool finished above Chelsea last season. They didn’t require a whole new team of good players. They needed better defenders, yes, but also a sprinkling of greatness. Even without Suarez would they be in retreat right now with Costa and Fabregas in the team? Kroos and James? Even Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao? Philippe Coutinho played well and Raheem Sterling tried his hardest but Liverpool did not have anyone who looked capable of hurting Real Madrid on Wednesday night. Less could have been more, if spent wisely. And they had more to offer than Tottenham when losing Bale, too. They had Champions League football and a great name and pedigree. Tottenham without Bale were a hard sell; Liverpool offered the prestige and the stage, even if Suarez would no longer be sharing it. Some lousy breaks are beyond policy, of course.  Sturridge has been injured since September. Having lost Suarez, that is a huge blow, but the late acquisition of Mario Balotelli has compounded the problem. Swapping shirts at half-time was the least of it against Madrid. Balotelli merited early withdrawal even before it became known that he was exchanging memorabilia with the opposition, when he should have been snarling in their direction, promising revenge. Balotelli did not get into scoring positions and his passes lacked care. When one went awry his default reaction was to display his displeasure with an unworthy team-mate, although the numbers in that category are now stacking up alarmingly as Balotelli bounces between a succession of major clubs in Europe. Suarez swapping Anfield for Barcelona left Liverpool manager Rodgers with a problem to solve in his attack . Tottenham haven't managed to replace Gareth Bale since he left White Hart Lane for Real Madrid in a world-record £86m move last year . Inter Milan, AC Milan, Manchester City; Jose Mourinho, Roberto Mancini, Cesare Prandelli. All have decided Balotelli’s maintenance was a bill they could no longer afford. What possessed Rodgers to think his methods held the secret to unlocking his genius and setting it loose? Ego. The comedian Bill Hicks said that if Satan came to earth he would have no trouble finding a partner because women everywhere would think they could change him. “But he’s the Prince of Darkness.” “You don’t know him like I do.” It’s the same with managers. Ego makes them think they hold the key. Rodgers got great performances, and behaviour, out of Suarez last season and perhaps he thought he could juggle fire again. Chelsea bought well in the summer, bringing in Spain internationals Cesc Fabregas (left) and Diego Costa . Harry Redknapp, who has a reasonable record with difficult characters, fancied his chances with Ravel Morrison. Ultimately, he scraped a Premier League place with Queens Park Rangers in a play-off, as Morrison sat on the sidelines, unusable. Liverpool have been forced by circumstance to rely on Balotelli and the £16m bargain is looking anything but. It is three years to the day since Balotelli asked ‘why always me’ and it is fair to say the fireworks have fizzled out. A cut-price transfer market masterstroke he is not. There is too much Moneyball at Liverpool. Too many attempts to marry cute value to the project, when replacing a player of Suarez’s influence and quality required grandly conventional thinking. Indeed, Suarez’s presence may have been all that would have saved the Balotelli transfer. The new man’s work-rate is an issue yet it would be hard to not put in a shift when the best player in the team is dogging left, right and into his own half to win the ball. Liverpool had nobody on the same level as Cristiano Ronaldo as they went down 3-0 to Real Madrid on Wednesday night . Sturridge has never worked harder than in tandem with Suarez. How could he do less, given the phenomenal effort of the Uruguayan? Balotelli’s posing simply would not have been tolerated with Suarez around. In this way, at least, he was a magnificent example. It is not too late for revival this season, Liverpool are fifth after all, level on points with fourth-place West Ham United who few are tipping to maintain a Champions League place. Around this time last year, though even if the results could still be random – Liverpool lost 3-1 to Hull City in December and were beaten at home by Southampton in September – there were significant signs that Rodgers had the team going in the right direction. There is little hint of year-on-year improvement now. Liverpool can still make the last 16 of the Champions League, or qualify for it next year through league position, but there are growing fears a return may prove beyond them. Undoubtedly they have not improved and, right now, do not appear title contenders. Without Suarez this transition was always going to be hard. It did not, however, have to be as tough as this. Tottenham’s struggles should have served as a warning, not a blueprint.

"Manchester City sent out a warning to their Premier League rivals with a convincing 3-1 win over Liverpool at The Etihad. Stevan Jovetic scored twice for the hosts, while Sergio Aguero added a third 23 seconds after being introduced as a second-half substitute. Brendan Rodgers' side gained a late consolation when Pablo Zabaleta put through his own net. Here, Sportsmail's Martin Keown gives his opinion on the performance of the players on Monday evening. All smiles: Sergio Aguero is congratulated by his team-mates after having an immediate impact as a substitute . MANCHESTER CITY (4-4-2) - TEAM AVERAGE 6.8 . Joe Hart - 7 . Maybe could have caught a few that he punched but solid and took few risks. Pablo Zabaleta - 6.5 . In his first game back after the World Cup look as solid as ever despite late own goal. Reads the game so well. Vincent Kompany - 6.5 . Nearly let in Sturridge early on but dominant after that and led his side by example. Martin Demichelis - 6 . Lucky not to be booked when Sterling outstripped him but better than last season. Gael Clichy - 8 . Best I’ve seen him play in a few years. His pace was essential in his battle with Sterling. Outstanding: Gael Clichy produced one of his best displays in years at left-back for Manuel Pellegrini's side . Fernando - 6 . Never strayed too far from his central zone. Provided a solid defensive buttress. Yaya Toure - 6.5 . Relatively quiet by his high standards. I’d have liked to see a bit more from him. Not at his best: Yaya Toure was uncharacteristically quiet in central midfield for the reigning champions . David Silva - 7 . Struggled in the first half but much more of an impact when he moved centrally. Samir Nasri - 6.5 . Quiet in the first half but came to life in the second with good movement off the line. Stevan Jovetic - 8 STAR MAN . Pure instinct for his first and a sublime flick for his second. Opener: Stevan Jovetic watches as his fierce strike rips into the back of Simon Mignolet's net in first half . Main man: Jovetic has started the season brilliantly for City, and he was the stand-out player on Monday night . Edin Dzeko - 6.5 . Not as exciting as City’s other hot-shots but led the line well until he came off. SUBS . Sergio Aguero - 7 . Looked bright during his time on the pitch and took his goal brilliantly 23 seconds after coming on. Clinical: Sergio Aguero needed just 23 seconds to leave his mark on the game - a firm finish past Mignolet . Fernandinho - 6 . Jesus Navas - 6 . MANAGER . Manuel Pellegrini - 8 . Went with two strikers and it paid off and you have to applaud that attacking instinct. Perfect performance: City boss Manuel Pellegrini's decision to play a 4-4-2 against Liverpool paid off . LIVERPOOL (4-3-3) - TEAM AVERAGE 6.3 . Simon Mignolet - 5.5 . Won’t be happy with the goals he let in, particularly Aguero’s side-foot at the post. Glen Johnson - 6 . Better at right back, looked quicker than at the World Cup but City were too strong. Dejan Lovren - 6.5 . If he wants to be the defensive leader he needs to get the back four working as a unit. Off the pace: Liverpool's summer signing from Southampton, Dejan Lovren, left, battles with Edin Dzeko . At fault: Alberto Moreno was thrown into the starting line-up by Brendan Rodgers but was culpable for first goal . Martin Skrtel - 6 . Solid in the first half when Liverpool were better, but could not keep City at bay. Alberto Moreno - 5.5 . Hesitation at this level is punished and he had his pocket picked by Jovetic for the goal. Joe Allen - 6 . Was busy in tight areas, moved the ball quickly, and linked well with Gerrard. Steven Gerrard - 6.5 . Started attacks well with Liverpool in charge but gradually had less of an impact. Jordan Henderson - 6.5 . Made some good, intelligent runs from deep but overrun in midfield late on. Philippe Coutinho - 6.5 . Was good going forward but sometimes left the inexperienced Moreno exposed. Daniel Sturridge - 7 . Showed quick feet and breezed past Kompany in the first half as if he wasn’t there. Raheem Sterling - 7 . His movement off the ball was good but they didn’t get it to him enough in the middle. Bad night at the office: Daniel Sturridge failed to find the back of the net at The Etihad against his former club . SUBS . Rickie Lambert - 6.5 . Prompted Liverpool's consolation goal, forcing Zabaleta to bundle in from close range late in the second half. Emre Can - 6 . Lazar Markovic - 6 . Late consolation: Pablo Zabaleta puts the ball past Joe Hart under pressure from Rickie Lambert . MANAGER . Brendan Rodgers - 6 . Liverpool started well but getting nailed by the Champions this early will affect confidence. REFEREE . Michael Oliver - 8 . No real controversial moments to deal with, though he might have booked Demichelis for bringing down Sterling.

"There Is something romantic about one of the supreme footballers of all time passing away just as his country of birth comes to the climax of its bid to win the World Cup. Vamos, vamos Argentina – in memory of Alfredo The Great.

This gentleman lived his 88 years to the full. There is a sense of history about the ultimate Real Madrileno bidding us farewell even as the Argentine successor to his throne in Spain is striving to join him among the top five players ever. Arise to the occasion, Lionel Messi, destiny beckons in Brazil these coming days. There is something uncanny, from our peculiarly English perspective, about The Maestro taking his final bow just as the Promenade Concert season is about to open at the Royal Albert Hall. Because Di Stefano’s unique mastery of the game in all its facets may best be described as him being, not only the virtuoso, but also the composer and conductor of every football orchestra in which he played. To watch him was to be enchanted by the creative magic he wove in midfield, to marvel at his reading and control of the game, to be astonished by his genius for scoring goals. To see him for the first time – as did a multitude of privileged Scots among the 127,621 crowd at Hampden Park and my generation of Englishmen on black-and-white television – was to be awoken to football so alien that it might have come not from Madrid but from Mars. That occasion, on a balmy Glasgow evening in May 1960, celebrated the fifth of the consecutive triumphs with which Real launched the European Cup into orbit. 100: Di Stefanao leads out a Rest Of The World side against England for the FA Centenary Cup in 1963.

Contrast: Di Stefano sits alongside striking Colombian keeper Rene Higuita on the bench . Double trouble: Di Stefano congratulates his fellow countrymen Diego Maradona after he received the 'Golden Ball' award for lifetime achievement in Paris on Jan 3, 1995 . It remains, in our memory as living witnesses, the most wondrous of all the finals in this competition, by whatever name it is known. Di Stefano had scored in the four preceding finals. There was never a doubt he would do so again on this night and more than half a century later he is still the only man to score on five of these occasions. Just to make sure, he ran up a hat-trick. His illustrious left-hand man Ferenc Puskas went one better as they claimed all Real’s goals between them in a 7-3 victory which also starred Gento and Del Sol. What made it all the more impressive was that Eintrach Frankfurt were typically formidable German opponents, who actually took the lead before the avalanche. For many of us, football changed that night. To see Di Stefano in person, as I was fortunate to do on a trip to Madrid not long before he departed Real in 1964, was to pay homage to the master. By then Don Alfredo had gone a mighty long way towards scoring a phenomenal 485 goals in 664  club appearancs for River Plate and Huracan in Argentina, Millonarios in Colombia, Real and finally Espanyol in Spain. In addition to those five European Cups, he racked up a host of league and cup-winners’ medals in all three of those countries and had twice been elected European Footballer of the Year.

Di Stefano played for Colombia and Argentina early in his career before later moving to, and playing for, Spain. 22 club trophies won as a player, including eight league titles and five consecutive European Cups with Real Madrid between 1956 and 1960. 5 Di Stefano scored in all five of those European Cup finals with Madrid, including a hat-trick in the last one against Eintracht Frankfurt in Glasgow.12 teams managed, including Valencia, Real Madrid and fierce Argentinean rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate. 6 trophies won as a manager, including a league and cup double with Boca Juniors. He won five runners-up medals with Real Madrid but managed just one title with Los Blancos - the 1990 Spanish Super Cup . So desperately sought after was Di Stefano in Spain that his transfer from Millonarios in 1953 was a matter of huge controversy. He had signed a first option to Barcelona but when their president questioned his value and hesitated, Real stepped in. Issues remained with River Plate, who retained his registration in Argentina. FIFA washed their hands of the mess and with the Spanish FA split on Barca v Madrid party lines there was much speculation that General Franco, Spain’s dictator, applied pressure for them to approve di Stefano’s signing for Real, of whom he was an avid supporter. It is more certain that Franco rubber-stamped second citizenship for the Buenos Aires-born di Stefano so he could play for Spain. FIFA had not recognised his four appearances for Colombia, while with Millonarios, but they refused initially to approve the Spanish request because he had played half a dozen times for Argentina. They relented, following diplomatic entreaties from Madrid. That complicated Di Stefano’s international career. A combination of  injuries and failures by Argentina and Spain to qualify deprived him of participation in the World Cup Finals. That was football’s loss, also. Even so, he scored 29 goals in his 37 official appearances for Argentina and Spain. Greats of the game: Di Stefano with France legend and UEFA boss Michel Platini during an homage to the Argentine in 2008 . Aloft: Di Stefano holding up a trophy in tribute to him in Madrid in 2008 .

Argentine trio: Di Stefano with Maradona presenting an award to Lionel Messi in 2009 . His exceptional football intelligence carried over into management, where he won multiple leagues and cups in Argentina and with Valencia in Spain. However, he was cursed to come second in five competitions in one season with Real, including the 1983 European Cup Winners’ Cup Final defeat by Aberdeen which, not least because of Di Stefano’s illustrious presence in the opposite dug-out, Sir Alex Ferguson counts as one of his greatest successes. That did not stop Real loving him. The feeling was mutual as he and Gento expressed to a few of us, Bobby Moore included, on one long, warm evening London in the 90s. It was an education to listen to him reflecting nostalgically on the attacking spirit which had been at the founding heart of the greatest of all club  teams. Real made him their honorary president. They gave him a permanent, rent-free home in a most pleasant apartment close by the Bernabeu, near which he was walking when the suffered his second, and this time fatal, heart attack. Always forever: Di Stefano was associated with Real Madrid right up until the end, posing in 2013 with new signing Gareth Bale .

"Manchester City are set to take on Liverpool on Monday night in the first super heavyweight clash of the new Premier League season. The two sides filled the top two spots at the end of last season, and after two epic ties between the sides, more fireworks will be expected at the Etihad Stadium. Here, Martin Keown runs the rule over the key factors that could determine the result of the game. Manuel’s men in the middle . Fernandinho and Yaya Toure were so strong as a midfield two last season that they allowed City to play two strikers. With Fernando now at the club, they have more options. He is more mobile than Javi Garcia, so Manuel Pellegrini can use him and Fernandinho to fight Liverpool’s strength in the middle. With the Brazilian boys sweeping up trouble, that leaves Toure to go and do some damage further up the pitch. But with City’s wide men joining the party, expect the midfield to get congested. Strength: Yaya Toure was vital to Manchester City's title charge last season . Addition: Whilst new arrival Fernando should add more defensive resolve to their engine room this time out . Brace yourself for a fast start. City scored 17 goals in the first 15 minutes of matches last season. Only Liverpool came close to matching them with 15 goals. Midfield balancing act . Without Luis Suarez, it is going to be interesting to see how Liverpool adapt. Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge were the standout players last weekend, but Philippe Coutinho has a key role to play this season. The Brazilian was excellent in the second half of last season and a surprise omission for the World Cup, though his country has seen sense and picked him for their latest squad. His trickery can trouble City, though that could require Lucas or Joe Allen to sit deep. They are naturally more inclined to defend, though Allen is better at moving the ball on quickly. His quality on the ball could be key in a fiery game. Standout: Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge starred for Liverpool last Sunday . Key role: But Philippe Coutinho's creativity could be key to Liverpool's chances this campaign . City more settled with one up top . Pellegrini went with two strikers for most of last season, but City played a lone striker home and away against two teams — Liverpool and Barcelona. Pellegrini respected Liverpool’s attacking style and I expect more of the same tonight. With Alvaro Negredo out and Sergio Aguero slowly coming back, Edin Dzeko offers the best balance in attack as a lone target man. Hold-up role: Edin Dzeko could offer Manchester City balance as a lone targetman . Preference: Although Manuel Pellegrini tends to favour playing two strikers in his team . Good memories . Brendan Rodgers will want to draw on last season’s matches against City. Liverpool gave them a scare in a 2-1 defeat at the Etihad and dented their title hopes in their epic 3-2 win at Anfield, only for City to recover. Both times City were tested to the limit and Pellegrini’s side will take nothing for granted. Pointers: Brendan Rodgers in discussion with new boys Javi Manquillo (left) and Alberto Moreno . Balotelli’s a bonus . There is a lot of negativity around Mario Balotelli, but his arrival can energise Liverpool. You won’t have heard many names mentioned more often in press conferences than Luis Suarez and Mario Balotelli, but Rodgers managed Suarez well and he can do it with Mario. He is a signing to get the fans out of their seats. Impact: Mario Balotelli's arrival on Merseyside could energise Liverpool this season . 2013-14 Man City 2-1 Liverpool . 2012-13 Man City 2-2 Liverpool . 2011-12 Man City 3-0 Liverpool . 2010-11 Man City 3-0 Liverpool . 2009-10 Man City 0-0 Liverpool . 2008-09 Man City 2-3 Liverpool . 2007-08 Man City 0-0 Liverpool . 2006-07 Man City 0-0 Liverpool . 2005-06 Man City 0-1 Liverpool . 2004-05 Man City 1-0 Liverpool .

"The last time Mike Brown played a Test in Auckland it all went badly wrong for him off the field but bouncing back from that, and proving what he is made of, has been the making of England’s world-class full back. In 2008, Brown was one of two England players found guilty of misconduct, fined and reprimanded by the RFU following a big night out after the First Test. The net result was that Brown lost his place and did not play again for England for four years. That’s an eternity when you are a young, ambitious, patriotic and very talented rugby player and it can make or break you. Brown was always a good player but not a great player and nobody was arguing stongly that he was a 'must' selection, including me. How times have changed. Back in the day: Mike Brown faced New Zealand with England in 2008 but his tour ended in controversy . Better player: Brown has returned to the England set-up with a bang following his four-year exile . Such experiences are normally a huge wake-up call but, if flipped around, can also be massive motivators. When you get picked for England you can start ‘living the dream’ and think it will last forever - 30 years on from my England playing career I remember that feeling only too well - but the reality is that your time at the top goes in a flash and you have to make every minute of every game count. To be left out for any reason other than ability is something that will haunt you forever. With England there are always players queuing up to take your place, they have so many good players in every position and if you step out of line or fall out of favour you have to ask yourself how much you really want it.  The only way back often is to become a ‘great’ player. Brown’s response was to redouble his efforts with Harlequins, help them to top domestic honours, become a model professional and that great player. It has been his very good fortune to have in Conor O’Shea, his boss at Quins, an outstanding individual who demands high standards while Stuart Lancaster is another rock-solid character. But it is Brown who deserves the plaudits and there is nothing better than to prove the doubters wrong. After four years of hard graft, Brown won back his place in the England team, initially on the wing against Scotland in 2012 before reclaiming the full-back berth. Now he returns to New Zealand as one of England’s 'go-to' men. It’s a big moment in every sense. Being ‘great’ at Twickenahm is one thing, being great in New Zealand is another level altogether. In the spotlight: To be left out of the England team for anything other than ability will haunt a player forever . Fortress: The All Blacks are unbeaten at Auckland's Eden Park  stadium for 20 years . Brown was recently voted Premiership player of the season by his peers and the Six Nations player of the season by the public which will guarantee him being targeted – as a player and individual - by New Zealand on Saturday. He should take that as a huge compliment, although it might not feel like it as he plucks another high ball out of the air with half the All Black pack in close attendance. New Zealand will target Brown in two ways, firstly as a player and then as an individual. They will have studied his running lines and how he always seems to break the first tackle. Brown invariably ups the tempo and intensity when he comes into the line or counter-attacks - things begin to happen - but New Zealand will also know the extra value of turning him over as often as possible. Often in the Northern Hemisphere we put too much emphasis on a full-back’s defensive qualities. For me full-back has always been a key attacking position, made for players who can ‘make something happen’. The southern hemisphere takes that view as well. You think of the carnage Christian Cullen used to cause at full-back and how he wasn’t so effective when he was moved to centre. More recently Australia’s most potent attacking weapon is Israel Folau, New Zealand look to Israel Dagg. You have to ask the question - who would the opposition least want running the ball back at them if they kick it away? In my time with England that was Jason Robinson and Josh Lewsey, now for England that is definitely Mike Brown. He is a huge attacking threat. Four tries in the recent Six Nations, 49 tries in 150 Premiership matches from full-back for Quins tells its own story. Dangerman: All Blacks full back Israel Dagg is a master of attacking with the ball from full back . Unpredictable: Jason Robinson was one is one of the finest examples of an attacking full back . Brown adds tempo to the game and England need to get him involved as much as possible so one thing I would like to see him do is follow all New Zealand kicks into touch and grab them before the ball-boys, so every time he has got the option of taking a quick throw, either to himself or a supporting player. It won’t always be on but England need to know that it is always an option and pour back in support. It’s a great way of imposing the tempo you want to play at. New Zealand will also test Brown’s character and see if he really can turn the other cheek in the heat of battle. He is a fiery, feisty character on the pitch -  Mr Angry to his team-mates -  and I like that attitude but you have to know exactly where that line is in Test rugby and avoid stepping over it. The All Blacks would love to get him involved in some verbals or a fracas of some sort because not only might it distract him it would get the whole Auckland crowd going and baying for English blood. The Kiwis always play better when it starts to kick off, when there is electricity in the air and the testosterone levels start rising as the clashes start getting close up and personal. They thrive off that but aren’t always so comfortable when a good side just goes quietly about its business and basically ignores them. Brown needs to rein it in and show all that great professionalism which has become the cornerstone of his game since he was last down Auckland way. On the run: England warm-up with some sprints prior to their training session at the Takapuna Rugby Cluib . Toughest test: Stuart Lancaster's England side face an almighty challenge in Saturday's match .","Harlequins full back Brown has made major improvements in his game since he toured New Zealand in 2008 .

"There were some big calls at Twickenham, but Northampton were the deserving winners of a terrific game which leaves me thinking there are direct comparisons between Saracens and England. Saracens, rather like England at present, have the team ethic, work-rate and commitment that every coach dreams of and are hugely competitive. But at the elite level, they are a couple of world-class players short of being able to seal the deal. Northampton in contrast had the two ‘special’ players on view yesterday in Courtney Lawes and George North who would both command a place in any current World XV on form like that. Dejected: Saracens players stand on the Twickenham pitch helpless after their Premiership final defeat . Disappointed: The London club were on the wrong end of a 24-20 defeat . Champions: Northampton lifting the Premiership trophy . World class: Sir Clive Woodward believes that Welsh Wizard George North is a game changer . That is two huge finals Saracens have lost in the last week on top of two big semi-finals last season. Close, very close, but no cigar. I am a big admirer of Mark McCall and am much encouraged by what Stuart Lancaster has achieved so far with England but, in both cases, there is another big step to take. To win at the elite level you need to either unearth special players or take the shackles off and free those you already have. Fine player that Brad Barritt is, Saracens need a more creative ball player and much better attacking kicker at No. 12. This is the case with England as well. To win a World Cup, England need at least four star players. Lawes is definitely one. We saw how the Jonny Wilkinson-Matt Giteau axis ran the show for Toulon against Saracens in Cardiff last week and I am convinced a Danny Cipriani-Owen Farrell combo could do the same for England, assuming the England  forwards continue their upward path. Farrell worries me a little in the short term, regardless of any injury concerns. He was poor yesterday by his own standards and was taught a lesson by Jonny last week. There will be some mental scars there as well as bruises as he flies down to New Zealand. He will bounce back but its been a tough week or two. Close, but no cigar: Saracens needed a more creative number 12 than Brad Barritt on Saturday . Axis: Toulon's Jonny Wilkinson and Matt Giteau (bottom) Meanwhile, I love the way Lawes has been going about his business this season — he is becoming a player of Martin Johnson’s stature, that’s how highly I rate him. He used to be a bit ragged and there were occasional flashes of ill-discipline but he has tightened that side of his game and now produces every time he goes on the field. Jim Mallinder and the Saints coaches have done a fine job with him and he was the player on view yesterday who will have most impressed Steve Hansen and the All Blacks down in Auckland. Lawes will have a big role to play in the Second and Third Tests. Key man: Courtney Lawes (top) can be compared to legendary captain Martin Johnson says Woodward . Last week, British rugby fans said goodbye to Jonny Wilkinson in Cardiff and yesterday it was Steve Borthwick’s turn at Twickenham. Some big names and important players are leaving the arena. It was Steve’s great misfortune that his career coincided with a handful of the very best locks in the history of English rugby - Martin Johnson, Ben Kay, Simon Shaw and Danny Grewcock - but he still  won 57 caps and captained  his country. Don’t underestimate his value. Borthwick’s superb line-out skills and consistency for Bath, and then Saracens, kept England’s best locks right on their toes throughout their careers. That is gold dust if you are national coach, that strength in depth drives everybody on to new heights. Bowing out: Steve Borthwick has retired after many years at the top . When I worked with Steve he was the first forward I had encountered who really wanted to work with coaches to plot and plan line-outs in detail. His line-out knowledge is second to none in world rugby and it is strange that England have not seen this. A humble man in the mould of Jonny, Steve has set the tone at Saracens. Eddie Jones has pulled off an outstanding piece of business by signing Steve as Japan’s line-out coach for the World Cup. He will bring massive technical knowledge to the job. I am fascinated by this situation developing with Worcester full-back Chris Pennell who has just broken into the England squad but will be playing with the Warriors in the Championship next season. Pennell has forced his way into England contention after a fine season in adversity in a struggling team, but is it really possible to challenge for an England World Cup place while playing in our second-tier league? I don’t think so. You have to ask, would Roy Hodgson pick a Championship player for a vital England game at the World Cup in Brazil this month? The answer is ‘No’ and the comparison is fair. Call up: Worcester full-back Chris Pennell has just broken into the England squad . Pennell’s loyalty to Worcester is not in question and, of course, ideally Dean Ryan would want his star player available, but we are talking about the season heading into a home World Cup. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and there can be no compromise. A solution needs to be found and England and the RFU need to meet Worcester halfway here. Pennell needs to be loaned out to a Premiership club for the season and preferably one who have qualified for the European champions Cup, because he is playing catch-up and needs as much exposure to that level of rugby as possible. In return, the RFU should help fund a top-quality overseas Test full-back replacement for Pennell at Sixways. This is a time for solutions, not questions. The Aviva Premiership or France’s T14 — which is the best? Both flagship national leagues have enjoyed really good seasons and drive each other on, but for me the T14 just nicks it. The dazzling array of world talent in France makes for an intoxicating mix that will eventually inspire rather than baulk young French talent. Divide: Steffon Armitage won the European Player of the Year award whilst playing for Toulon but is excluded from playing for England . The atmosphere at some games - I was at Felix Mayol recently - is extraordinary, but what clinches it is that in France winning the T14 is still rated above winning the Heineken Cup. That adds an incredible intensity to proceedings. Wouldn’t it be interesting to stage an annual game between the two leagues in which the overseas players would all be available. Any takers?","Northampton beat Saracens 24-20 (AET) in the Premiership final .

"EXCLUSIVE . As the decision over the future of the Olympic Stadium edges ever closer, one of West Ham’s most famous fans has called for the east London club to be named as the anchor tenants of the venue. Hollywood actor Ray Winstone has pleaded for ‘common sense to prevail’ as the Hammers wait to find out who will be named as the preferred bidder by the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) on Wednesday. The Premier League club are up against League One side Leyton Orient, a football business college and a group keen to bring Formula One racing to the Olympic Park. But Winstone exclusively tells Sportsmail there can only be one winner... I was born in Hackney and spent my early years living in Plaistow so I grew up in the area where the Olympics Games were held. I loved living in east London and we are a special bunch of people where community spirit and passion form a major part of who we are. But I’ve watched how the area has changed over time and know only too well that it has needed rejuvenation for many, many years. The fun and games of the Olympics are over now and we have a golden opportunity to really change the perception of the area and put the pride back in east London. Decision time: The future of the Olympic Stadium is set to be decided . Like most other East Enders, I’m a lifelong supporter of West Ham United and I feel so passionately about my club and the area I grew up in that wanted to share my thoughts on how I think the Olympic Stadium can be used to help make that change. As many people know, the club are currently going through the process of trying to become tenants at the Stadium, a process that could be concluded soon. I keep hearing this word ‘legacy’ but I think it’s been overused to the point where people don’t really know what it means. For me, the word legacy is simply about what we are going to leave for our future generations. I remember when I was a boy my Dad used to take me to the cinema in east London every Wednesday and I used to watch the actors on the big screen and thought ‘I want to do what that geezer does’. It’s exactly the same for the kids around us today. We need to give them something to aspire to. West Ham’s Vice-Chairman Karren Brady has said that if the club are chosen, they are determined to create an arena that can be used for athletics, football and the community. This means that young kids will be able to follow in my footsteps and see their idols and role models up close every week, while also getting involved in skills coaching that the West Ham community department provide. It’s the perfect match. Grand plans: West Ham's Vice-Chairman Karren Brady (R) has said that if the club are chosen, they are determined to create an arena (below) that can be used for athletics, football and the community . For me and for thousands of other East Londoners, the one consistent focal point of the area is our football team. I think the club have something like half a million supporters in East London and Essex. As the population of London has expanded, people who were born and bred in east London have slowly started to move out into places like Essex. But the main reason we have for coming back is West Ham United; it’s our roots and it’s about where we are from. It’s in our blood from the day we’re born. So I think the fitting legacy for this area and the rest of the country would be to allow West Ham United to help fulfil the dreams of the people of East London and become tenants of the Olympic Stadium. Yes it would bring a great future for the club, but more importantly it would rejuvenate the area as well. The prestige of having a Premier League club playing in that Stadium would keep the focus of the world on Stratford for generations and long after the memories of the summer’s spectacular sporting moments have faded away. Legacy: After the success of the London 2012 Olympics (above and below), athletics will play an important part in the stadium's future - but so can West Ham, argues Winstone . Although athletics must have a future at the stadium, a key question for me is ‘Do we want to see the Olympic Stadium used maybe once or twice every six months by just having athletics there?’. I certainly don’t. Having West Ham there would bring tens of thousands of people from all over the country to the Olympic Park every other week and keep that lively atmosphere we saw during the summer. It would also bring new jobs to the area, not just working at the Stadium, but also the surrounding areas. The club alone have promised to create over 700 new positions. People will want to bring their businesses back, which will rejuvenate this area. If you go around some parts of east London at the moment all you see are shops that are closed and people having to go somewhere else to find a job. I think that West Ham moving into that stadium would help bring some of that buzz back. Hammer time: West Ham want to leave their Upton Park (below) home to start a new, exciting era in Stratford . On the football side, it would be good for the club and it would attract great players who would want to play in a great stadium. It is the way forward for West Ham. The way the club has been run over the past two years by the people who run it proves they are more than capable of taking West Ham into that Stadium and turning them into a very successful club both on and off the field. They also genuinely care about East London. We are not Liverpool or Man United but we are a big club with a proud history. We won the World Cup by the way. We are a famous name, a name that hasn’t been realised to its full potential yet, but I think at last we are in good hands to realise that potential. Being offered the chance to play in the Olympic Stadium would be the icing on the cake. It's time for common sense to prevail.

"A Pennsylvania high school senior student was suspended Thursday when he asked Miss America, Nina Davuluri, out to the prom when she made an appearance at the school. Davuluri was at Central York High School in York, just south of the state capital, Harrisburg, Thursday when Patrick Farves, 18, asked Miss America to prom during a question and answer session. Farves said he received three days of in-school suspension he asking the reigning Miss America out to the prom. Scroll down for video . Miss America, Nina Davuluri, was at a high school in York, Pennsylvania when she got asked to the prom by a senior, who was then suspended for  three days for asking her the question . Although he was warned not to by a staff member, Patrick Farves, 18, asked Miss America out to the prom during an appearance she made at the school, earning Farves a three-day suspension. 'They (administrators) did that because they told me not to but I did it anyway,"" Farves responded on Twitter to a question from areporter. 'They did what they had to.' Davuluri was at the school Thursday to talk with students about diversity and the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. She also gave keynote speech at the school's annual diversity celebration. It wasn't a spur of the moment decision for Farves. He had joked with friends about doing it when he heard Miss America was coming to the school, according to the York Dispatch. And as the day got closer, he was asked increasingly if he was going to go through with it. School administrators caught wind of Farves' plan, and one staff member pulled him aside before the assembly and told him it would be inappropriate to ask Davuluri out. But that didn't stop Farves. 'At that point in time, it was 10 minutes before the presentation, and I was pretty much set to do it,' he said. 'I was a little pressured. Everybody expected me to do it. I'm the kind of person who, if someone says I won't do something, I'll prove people wrong. I will.' Nina Davuluri, representing New York, reacts after being crowned Miss America on September 15, 2013 in Atlantic City, New Jersey . The school, facing criticism from some who thought the administration went to far, responded on Friday afternoon. 'It is not our practice to discipline a student for asking someone — even Miss America — to a school dance,' the statement from the Central York School District reads in part. 'However, it is our practice to set expectations for student behavior, to communicate those expectations and rules to students and families and to ensure those rules are followed within our schools. This practice is not uncommon and happens every day, multiple times a day, in schools, businesses and homes across America.' The school district also took offense to the media's reporting of the incident, saying, 'it's as shame that the media wants to frame this story to sell papers and make headlines using a distortion of what actually occurred.' Many students, however, think the administration overreacted, and took to social media to express their feeling, using the hashtag #freepatty on Twitter. 'True diversity is when you don't punish someone for being a little bit different"" @CYStudentUnion tweeted.","Nina Davuluri was at Central York High School in Pennsylvania as part of a diversity event .

"On a Wimbledon afternoon of brooding clouds, driving rain and seething frustration, the face of Rafael Nadal beamed out like a beacon. For the world No1 has discovered his most formidable form when it matters most and the second week carries the promise of dramatic achievement. His satisfaction could not be concealed or contained. His 6-7, 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 victory over Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan was scarcely unexpected but the manner of his triumph, the way in which he was required to solve his problems and find his game, was enormously impressive. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's day six verdict with Whitwell and Fraser . Comeback man: Rafael Nadal comfortably dispatched Mikhail Kukushkin after an early setback . The loss of the first set could almost have been a part of his grand plan, since it allowed him to flick through the gears before delivering a performance of towering authority. He was watched from the Royal Box by some of the most imposingly regal figures in British sport. David Beckham, whose aristocratic credentials are increasingly accepted, Victoria Pendleton, of blessed Olympic memory, and Sir Bobby Charlton, whose blood runs as blue as anybody born to the purple. They stood as one when Nadal closed out his success, recognising a kindred spirit, acclaiming a champion at the peak of his powers. The Spaniard would later express his delight in his progress. 'I finished all my matches playing better than when I started and that is very positive. I'm very happy to be in the second week after two years losing in the first and second rounds. I am fighting for every ball and playing to find the right solutions in every game.' Ouch! The Spaniard lost the first set after a tense tiebreak on centre court on Saturday afternoon . From a man who is not given to idle chatter, it sounded distinctly ominous for his rivals. Nadal plays tennis like a great fighter warming to his work. Watch him open his body to throw the big forehand and you see images of Hearns, Hagler and Leonard, that dazzling trinity of terrifying middleweights. The intent is mean, the execution savagely impeccable, the effect disastrous. In the thin, grey light beneath the Centre Court roof, with the rain splattering the crowds outside and June wearing the colours of January, the similarity was irresistible. And it was a genuine contest, a real match for an hour of the first unpredictable set. Kukushkin, ranked 63 in the world, went for his shots without fear of consequence. And the greater the gamble, the greater the reward. The first serve was testing, the double-fisted backhand a blunt weapon. Hard as Nadal worked and chased, his unfancied opponent found most of the answers. His tie-break success was awarded the clamorous approval of the Centre Court crowd. Given a right runaround! Kukushkin struggled to cope once he took the first set as Nadal progressed easily . 'He played fantastic in that first set,' said Nadal. 'I was thinking: ""If he is able to play like that for three sets, I will be in trouble"".' He considered his problems on an extended toilet break at the close of the set. When he emerged, to the faint disapproval of that crowd, he was a man restored. Mild incontinence is a besetting affliction of certain tennis stars, especially when they have just lost a set, but he seemed surprised at the faint hint that he had been guilty of gamesmanship. 'I needed to go to the bathroom, that's all. It wasn't because I wanted to have a break. I needed it.' With a truly English reticence on such matters, his questioners did not press him further. In any event, the change in his game was impossibly dramatic. The great ones in any sport can lift their form when they most need to and Nadal simply flicked a switch and surged away. Aware that he had lost the opening set of both his matches last week, Nadal was also aware that he could find himself at will. And so it proved. He broke Kukushkin in the fourth game of the second set and from there his course was set. A little bit damp: Wimbledon was a sea of umbrellas on a miserable day in SW19 . As the winners began to flow, as the pace was raised and the angles became more improbable, his opponent seemed almost visibly to shrink. The warrior of the first set now wore the nervous apprehension of a bank clerk plucked from the crowd and furnished with a racquet. Where his problems had once seemed so simple, now they were far beyond solution. Nadal hustled through the second set in 35 minutes and the third in 28. At times, we wanted to look away, the way we used to when Hagler had trapped some pain-racked victim on the ropes. There was one hopelessly outclassed contender who asked his manager for the best way to approach a fight with Marvellous Marvin. 'Don't make him angry,' came the useful response. Poor Kukushkin could have employed a similar tactic. Game followed game in unchallenged monotony, with the fourth set going the way of its predecessors. 'I played aggressive, I had great movement, I just felt great,' said Nadal. 'Nobody can say this is not a special place.' Likewise, nobody can say that this is not a remarkably special player. There were times yesterday when he wore that air of invulnerability, times when he seemed quite unplayable. All may change over this crucial week, of course. The likes of Murray, Djokovic, even Federer may come up with the answers which were way beyond Kukushkin. But the current signs are enormously encouraging for Nadal. Champion in 2008 and 2010, his chances of a third title were shining brightly through the Wimbledon gloom.","Spaniard lost the opening set on centre court .

"An Ohio couple accused of refusing to rent apartments to black people because they 'decrease the value of the complexes' have agreed to pay $850,000 to settle a lawsuit. John and Mary Ruth, who own three apartment complexes in Massillon, 20 miles south of Akron, had also been accused of discriminating against families with children, allegedly telling managers they 'should be restricted to basement or first floor units'. The couple have now agreed to pay $650,000 in damages and legal fees to a number of plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed by the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, Stark County, former residents and employees. An Ohio couple accused of refusing to rent apartments to black people because they 'decrease the value of the complexes' have agreed to pay $850,000 to settle a lawsuit . They will also pay a $25,000 fine to the government and $175,000 in damages to 11 former residents and employees. The couple has agreed a consent order which sees the lawsuit resolved without trial and without the Ruths admitting guilt, the US Attorney's Office spokesman Mike Tobin told Reuters. A statement issued by the Department of Justice yesterday said the settlement must still be approved by United States District Judge John R. Adams in the Northern District of Ohio. The lawsuit had alleged the Ruths  discriminated against African Americans and families with children at the apartments - Yorkshire Apartments, Thackeray Ledges and Wales Ridge - in Massillon, Ohio. According to the court documents, ten former employees of the couple testified they were told to discriminate against African-Americans. According to court documents, the couple told managers, 'that African-American tenants were undesirable and decreased the value of the complexes'. It is also claimed the couple said families with children were also not desirable and 'should be restricted to basement or first floor units.' Former employees were interviewed for the lawsuit, which was filed in October 2011. John and Mary Ruth own three apartment complexes in Massillon, 20 miles south of Akron, Ohio . They claimed tenants in the apartments faced 'discriminatory treatment in an effort to induce them to move out', while managers were threatened with being fired if they did not come up with grounds to evict them. Molly Moran, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, said: 'It is a sad fact that decades after the passage of the Fair Housing Act, many people still face unlawful discrimination when looking for housing. 'The magnitude of this settlement makes clear that the Department of Justice will vigorously pursue violations of the Fair Housing Act.' As part of the settlement, the defendants and all employees will be required to undergo anti-discrimination training. The Ruths meanwhile will also be required to hire an independent management company for the running of all properties and report to the FHA for a period of three years on their compliance with the settlement. U.S. Attorney Steven M.Dettelbach, for the Northern District of Ohio, said: 'The freedom of every family to live where they wish, without regard to their race or if they have kids, is basic to who we are in this country. 'When landlords deny that basic right, there will be consequences. We will continue to work hard to ensure that this fundamental right is protected in Ohio and across the nation.'","John and Mary Ruth accused of discriminating against black people and families with children .

"Germany may have won the FIFA World Cup but Australia has toppled the nation to take out the coveted RoboCup 2014 - held in Brazil. The University of NSW robot football team, rUNSWift, were ruthless in their march to the finals, racking up 37 goals against 19 international teams with no goals conceded. In the electrifying final of the standard platform league, UNSW were galvanised into action after Nao – Team HTWK from Leipzig University of Applied Sciences took early possession. The UNSW robots struck back with an early goal and kept up the pressure to defeat their rivals 5-1 while B-Human, another German team who were the defending champions, took third place. Scroll down for video . The UNSW robots took out the RoboCup for the first time since 2003 . A UNSW robot recharges its batteries after a triumphant win against Nao - Team HTWK from Leipzig University of Applied Sciences . In the standard platform league all teams compete with identical robots but different software. The UNSW team wrote an impressive 125,000 lines of code to help their 15 robot protégés to victory. The robots are autonomous however they do need the occasional helping hand to get back on their feet after a tricky tackle. Brad Hall from the UNSW Computer Science and Engineering School said beating B-Human in the semi-final had been seven years in the making. ‘Unfortunately, during the final, after our goalie saved an attempt, he fell over and while trying to get back up and in position we conceded the only goal during the entire competition' he said. ‘To win the overall tournament, as well as the demo ‘All-Stars vs Champions’, wrapped up a great year.’ ‘Some of our longer-serving team members can now retire from the league with big smiles on their faces,’ Mr Hall said. ‘For our new members, I hope they are inspired to help us defend the title next year in China.’ The humans left - right: team coach Bernhard Hengst and students Zijie Mei and Sean Harris - with two of their champion robots . Head of UNSW Computer Science and Engineering, Maurice Pagnucco congratulated the team and coach Bernhard Hengst for their long nights in the lab. ‘This result showcases UNSW and Australian research expertise in robotics internationally,’ he said. There are four robot football divisions in RoboCup, the world’s largest robot competition: small size, middle size, humanoid league and standard platform league. The UNSW team last won the competition in 2003, although they were runners-up in 2010 and have regularly placed in the top three teams. The expertise developed on the playing field was expected to be translated into more serious research including robotic systems for applications in health, transport and industry. In the meantime, UNSW’s athletic androids will soak up the limelight, and a little electricity, before heading home to much-deserved fanfare in Australia.

"Today, for the first time in 13 years, whistleblowing consultant cardiologist Dr Raj Mattu can look to the future with a glimmer of hope. After more than a decade of ‘torture’ - during which he says NHS bosses ‘tried to silence me, destroy my reputation and erase me from the face of the Earth’ - his good name was this week dramatically restored. Bullied and then sacked by his NHS bosses after exposing the avoidable deaths of patients at his Coventry hospital, the 54-year-old heart specialist was vindicated on Thursday after a David-and-Goliath battle thought to have cost taxpayers £10million. Vindicated: Dr Raj Mattu with his wife Sangeeta . Suspended in 2002 after he exposed the fact that two patients had died in overcrowded bays at his hospital, Dr Mattu fell victim to what he described as a ‘heinous’ smear campaign. He was reinstated in 2010, only to be dismissed a year later as he lay seriously ill in hospital. But his name was finally cleared this week when an employment tribunal found that Dr Mattu had been unfairly dismissed. In a landmark judgment, the tribunal ruled that Dr Mattu had been targeted specifically by hospital managers because he’d blown the whistle on dangerous practices. This is Dr Mattu’s first in-depth newspaper interview since his name was cleared, and what he reveals is a shocking indictment of the way the NHS is managed and the way it treats staff who speak out on behalf of patients. He is now seeking a meeting with Health Minister Jeremy Hunt, but has this stark warning for any other health professional thinking of blowing the whistle to protect their patients. ‘Don’t do it, because the way I have been treated is nothing short of an outrage and a scandal,’ said Dr Mattu, a once world-renowned specialist who is now unemployed and doubts his medical career will ever recover. ‘Instead of listening to me, embracing what I said and working with me to improve conditions for patients, Trust managers tried to destroy me. It was a form of torture. ‘They stopped at nothing to change the focus from the patients - who were at the heart of my concerns - onto false claims about this allegedly “bad doctor” who needed to be removed. ‘They tried to shut me up and sideline me. I was marched from my office in broad daylight in front of my staff, colleagues and patients sitting in my waiting room. Persecuted: Dr Mattu told how he was marched out of his office by security guards and suspended for years after blowing the whistle . ‘Rather than work with me to improve patient care, they searched for reasons to discredit me, humiliate me and destroy my career. And once they’d set the wheels in motion, they were prepared to throw millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money at it. ‘I am relieved that this judgment completely vindicates me. It found I had not caused nor contributed to my dismissal; that my dismissal was inextricably linked to whistleblowing and that I had suffered directly. ‘Patients have been betrayed. Even today, there has still been no investigation into the deaths that I witnessed.’ Yesterday, a spokesperson for University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust (formerly Walsgrave Hospitals NHS Trust) said in a statement: ‘We are disappointed by the Employment Tribunal’s decision that the dismissal of Dr Mattu was unfair, given that the procedure followed by the Trust was reviewed by the Court of Appeal in March 2012 when it found in the Trust’s favour. ‘The Trust now needs to examine the Tribunal’s decision in more detail (it runs to 400 pages) to consider its grounds for appeal. ‘As a Trust, we will continue to support all our staff to raise issues of concern in our effort to provide continuous improvement in our services to patients.’ Born in Coventry, Dr Mattu graduated from University College London and has been employed by the NHS since 1984, working at a number of teaching hospitals in London and in Sheffield. He was a heart specialist of international standing, and attracted millions of pounds in funding for research into the genetic causes of heart disease. He helped establish medical schools and says he was head-hunted by the NHS Trust in Coventry and tasked with doing the same there. It was through his work that he met his wife Sangeeta, 41, who works for a pharmaceutical company, although the stress of the past decade has put enormous strain on both their lives. Married in 2009, Dr Mattu’s ill-health - he suffers from an auto-immune disease - was exacerbated by the stress. ‘I am very fortunate that my wife has stood by me throughout and been a huge source of strength,’ he says. ‘We had hoped to have a family by now, and, God willing, we will have children. I hope they will have a father still able to kick a ball around in the park with them.’ Until he arrived at Coventry’s Walsgrave Hospital, Dr Mattu says that there had never been a single complaint about him. It is a source of professional pride that the bosses who seemed so keen to be rid of him after he blew the whistle found not one incident of alleged clinical negligence to include with the 200 false allegations that they made. These false claims included fraud, bullying, bribery and sexual impropriety - which both the General Medical Council and the police dismissed as completely unfounded. Dr Mattu clearly remembers the day in December 1999 when a 35-year-old man who was vomiting blood died on an acute medical ward. Dr Mattu says the bay was overcrowded so that medical staff were unable to move him nearer life-saving equipment. He believes the man’s death could have been avoided. ‘When a patient dies in such circumstances, it is very distressing and demoralising. You try to do your absolute best for the individual, even if it is just to ease their suffering if you cannot save them. ‘And I felt those patients who died in our hospital shouldn’t have died - and certainly not on that day at that time. There were five patients in a four-bed bay. If one of those patients was in trouble, then we knew we’d be in serious difficulties. ‘It was very upsetting to see that happen. The NHS has provided money to provide these services. It should not be acceptable for some manager to decide to reconfigure the beds in such a dangerous way . ‘I felt I had been prevented from saving these people’s lives because some manager - without consulting the medical staff - had just decided that that is what they wanted to do.’ Dr Mattu says he and other doctors repeatedly raised concerns about the practice of putting five patients in bays designed and equipped for four, and expressed concern over the subsequent deaths. After the Trust’s Chief Executive appeared on BBC TV in September 2001 and denied that deaths had occurred relating to the five-in-four overcrowding, Dr Mattu went public by giving his own interview to BBC News. In February 2002, Dr Mattu was suspended and escorted off the premises pending an investigation into allegations of intimidation made by a junior doctor. Meeting: Dr Mattu wants to explain his point of view to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . Judgment: A tribunal ruling found against managers at the Walgrave Hospital in Coventry, now University Hospital Coventry . ‘That was the most awful experience of my life, being marched out by the medical director and the HR director, with two security guards behind them.’ Dr Mattu was suspended from his £70,000-a-year job on three-quarters of his salary for five and a half years. According to his solicitors, the NHS spent money, too, on a PR agency and on hiring private detectives. The suspension alone reportedly cost the trust £2.5m. ‘It is very distressing when you are prevented by non-medical people from doing what you love doing, when you feel there is so much you can give,’ says Dr Mattu, whose suspension was the longest in NHS history. ‘It is also very depressing. Quite apart from not being able to work, I was prevented from talking to anybody at the hospital, so I also felt isolated from my profession. ‘In hindsight, my mistake was to believe that there were enough good men and women in the NHS senior management and the Department of Health who would step up and say: “Stop! What you are doing to this doctor is wrong.” ‘Those people are not there. Instead, there is culture of closing ranks and persecuting any whistleblower. ‘I went into medicine because I wanted to spend the rest of my life trying to help people, care for them and possibly save lives along the way. That’s what drives me. ‘What managers do is they come in and they want to have a career in management. My impression is that it really doesn’t matter to these individuals if that’s in the NHS, banking or retail. ‘There’s been a shift in my working life from managers working alongside clinical staff to dictating from a central office how care should be delivered, which may not be in the best interests of patients. ‘And so millions of pounds which could have been better spent elsewhere have been wasted persecuting me. It is ridiculous.’ He was determined to fight to clear his name. Today, he feels he has done that. Whether his career will ever recover is another matter. Of his future plans, he says: ‘For now, I just want to digest the tribunal ruling and spend the next year concentrating on recovering my health.’","Dr Raj Mattu spoke out over avoidable deaths in a Coventry hospital in 2002 .

"Rangers boss Ally McCoist has told Celtic counterpart Ronny Deila it would be dangerous to write off the Ibrox men. The Old Firm rivals will both go into the hat for Saturday's League Cup semi-final draw - raising the prospect of a first Glasgow derby since the Light Blues were liquidated in the summer of 2012. McCoist has already admitted he would take 'anyone but Celtic' as he looks to steer Scottish Championship side Rangers to their first major final under his management. Rangers boss Ally McCoist says the SPL champions Celtic shouldn't underestimate his side . But he stressed Deila was wrong on Thursday to suggest Rangers are weaker than Premiership outfits Aberdeen and Dundee United, the other teams through to the last four. The Hoops boss claimed the 'best teams are in the top division', but McCoist chose to politely disagree with the Norwegian's assessment. He said: 'Ronny is entitled to his opinion and maybe it makes sense because we are the only team from outside the top division. I can understand Ronny's logic, yeah. 'I don't think it's unfair but then I don't necessarily agree with it. I can understand where he is coming from. In most cases you would think a team from a lower division that is left in a competition with three teams from the league above is the weaker side. 'Ronny would be 100 per cent right in his beliefs if it was a normal playing field. But I don't think anyone can argue that in recent years, Scottish football has been anything but a normal playing field. 'We have got three of the top five clubs in the country playing in the division below the top flight. Celtic boss Ronny Deila has overseen a disappointing start to the season . 'So that doesn't make it a normal playing field.' Rangers have knocked out top-flight opposition twice on their way to the semi-finals. Inverness - last year's finalists - were beaten 1-0 at Ibrox last month, before the League One champions repeated that scoreline when they saw off William Hill Scottish Cup winners St Johnstone on Tuesday. McCoist says that is the basis of his confidence. 'Celtic are favourites,' said the Ibrox boss. 'Surely everybody will accept that? I think we are the outsiders along with Aberdeen and United. 'That's not mind games, it's the definite opinion of football fans. 'But we fancy our chances. I believe Aberdeen and United are two of the better sides in the country on their day but we have proved this year that against teams from the top flight, we can handle the occasion and we now look forward to the draw.' Striker Kenny Miller also believes Rangers can make Deila eat his words. The former Celtic frontman said: 'It's a game I never thought I would get to play in again, so whether it be in a semi or a final, it would be one I'd look forward to. 'Let's be honest, they would go in as favourites. They are the reigning champions of the SPL, playing at the higher level, but we would go in confident, as we do with every game. Kenny Miller thinks Rangers could spring a surprise if they are paired against their arch-rivals in the Cup . 'We are in the Championship, we are the lowest-ranked team, so [what Deila said] makes sense a little bit. But only time will tell who the strongest is and who the weakest is.' Rangers return to Dumbarton on Saturday for a Scottish Cup third-round tie just a week after beating them 3-0 at the Bet Butler Stadium on league duty. But once again the build-up to the match has been overshadowed by events in the Ibrox boardroom. Mike Ashley has tightened his grip on the club after the Newcastle owner's £2million loan was accepted. The terms allow Ashley to put two of his own men on the board, while two of his close allies - Derek Llambias and Barry Leach - have been hired as consultants. Non-executive chairman David Somers has assumed executive responsibility for the time being as he leads the search for a new chief executive following Graham Wallace's resignation. But McCoist said he had still to hear from Ashley's people directly. 'I wouldn't expect to [speak to Ashley or his people] but I'm obviously available to speak to any board members or shareholders should they want to,' McCoist said. 'I do have dialogue with the chairman. I spoke to him on Monday and then yesterday again. He's keeping me up to speed on what the board are doing and that is fine.'","Rangers and Celtic are in the hat for the League Cup semi-final draw .
A potential match-up could see the two teams meet for the first time since Rangers entered liquidation in June 2012 .
Ally McCoist says Celtic would be foolish to underestimate his side ."
"To Ally McCoist, a rough calculation of how much Scottish football has missed Old Firm competition can be made by adding empty blue seats to empty green seats. There were plenty of those for the midweek League Cup ties that took Rangers and Celtic into the last four of the competition. Combine the swathes of space at Ibrox on Tuesday night with the similar scene at Parkhead the following evening and another 70,000 spectators could have been accommodated. McCoist knows full well, however, that there are few stadiums on the globe with the capacity to accommodate demand if Saturday's semi-final draw brings about a first meeting since April 2012. Ally McCoist believes a Rangers vs Celtic League Cup semi-final could fill the Maracana in Rio . ‘The irony is not lost on me,’ said the Rangers manager. ‘You had 16,000 at the Celtic game on Wednesday. You had 13,000 at our game on Tuesday night. ‘But if Rangers play Celtic in the semi-final or the final you could play the game at the Maracana. ‘In terms of the greater good of Scottish football it would be a good thing. Everybody would look forward to the game.’ There would doubtless be some willing to incur the travelling expense even it was Sugarloaf Mountain, rather than Mount Florida, forming the backdrop to the semi-final. The odds on a long-awaited derby encounter are shorter than they have ever been since Rangers were last resident in the top flight. The club’s financial meltdown of 2012 – which eventually saw an asset transfer to a new company set up by Charles Green and his backers - left the other 11 top flight sides with a decision to make. Ten decided to vote against their re-admission to what was then the SPL, leaving Rangers to eventually find a place in the old Third Division. McCoist has made his views clear on that process, believing it was fuelled by a form of blood-lust that defied the best interests of the Scottish game. The excitement generated by the possibility of the Old Firm locking horns once more is, he feels, further evidence of how misguided some were. McCoist would relish the return of the Old Firm clashes but must rely on cup competitions . ‘I can understand the interest,’ he said. ‘Gone are the days of “we don’t need Rangers in the top flight”. ‘Sadly, because it’s too late, there is now a little bit of common sense being shown. ‘It’s clear we do need Rangers, Hearts and Hibs in the top-flight. ‘Gordon (Strachan) is doing a fantastic job for the national team, but in the best interest of Scottish football we need our big clubs in the top flight. ‘With Rangers being in the lower divisions there was clearly going to be no scope for an Old Firm game unless we drew each other in the cups. ‘The majority of people, if we do draw each other, can actively look forward to an Old Firm game and I more than anyone can appreciate that. ‘I have great pals who are Celtic supporters as well. I’ve had boys coming up to me in the street and they are dying for you to get back. Celtic supporters, and Rangers supporters obviously, who miss the intensity and excitement of that Old Firm game and the chase for the title.’ The absence of the fixture has also been felt financially. It was what drove the television deal as far as satellite broadcasters were concerned, as witnessed by the subsequent renegotiation. Remarkably, the Premiership is also without title sponsor for a second season. So, does McCoist feel those most vocal about demoting Rangers in 2012 may now regret their stance? Kenny Miller (left) celebrates with goalscorer Lewis Macleod as Rangers beat St Johnstone in the League Cup . ‘Knowing the pig-headedness of some of the people involved, no they won’t,’ he insisted. ‘But let’s be honest, was it for the greater good of Scottish football? Of course it wasn’t. Absolutely wasn’t. ‘But we are where we are and things have happened. There is no use in looking back the way because we can’t change anything.’ The significance of the Old Firm being drawn together would clearly extend way beyond the Hampden pitch – just ask Police Scotland – but ultimately it would be about the two biggest clubs in the country being reunited in a sporting contest. Celtic would obviously start as clear favourites, hence McCoist suggesting in midweek that he would rather avoid them to bolster chances of winning the tournament. Yet the 52-year-old is also growing in confidence about his side’s chances should it happen and admits part of him longs for the renewal of old rivalries. The scorer of 27 Old Firm goals as a player, he recorded two wins and two defeats against Celtic during his one season of top-flight management. ‘I’ve missed the games and I think Scottish football has missed them,’ he added. ‘Contrary to what one or two people might have said at the time, it still was one of the biggest club matches in the world. Celtic's John Guidetti scored three against Partick Thistle to send his side into the last four . ‘You can talk about differences of quality, absolutely. But in terms of atmosphere it is certainly up there with anything. ‘I didn’t miss them two years ago because I didn’t really fancy playing Celtic or indeed any real top-flight club. ‘Last year we were better and competed reasonably well against Dundee United. This year, we feel we are slightly better again to handle the threat of a Celtic, an Aberdeen or a Dundee United.’ The possibility of an all-Glasgow semi-final has, for however short a time, removed the focus from the off-field turmoil at Ibrox. Two associates of Mike Ashley - Derek Llambias and Barry Leach - this week started work as consultants in the first moves to form a new regime heavily influenced by the Sports Direct billionaire. McCoist, though, will head into today’s William Hill Scottish Cup third round tie at Dumbarton without any fresh information about the way ahead for the club. ‘I spoke to the chairman yesterday on the phone and he was just keeping me up to speed about the board and the search for a chief executive,’ added McCoist. ‘Again, he just said to concentrate on things we can effect, which is following on from Tuesday’s result with a performance that can hopefully get us into the next round of the Scottish Cup.’","Rangers could draw Celtic in the League Cup semi-finals .

"Kate Moss was in town as the event kicked off . After New York and London, it's Milan's turn to have a say as to how women will dress for the spring-summer 2013. If the first day of previews was any indication, next summer will feature a lot of bold colour and patterns. While the more structured, usually daytime, looks were in heavier fabrics, evening or playtime came in airier, diaphanous materials like chiffon and tulle. 'Sophisticated and essential': Gucci's Spring and Summer 2013 collection featured bold shades . Romantic looks: Some of the delicate prints were reminiscent of Japanese . floral wallpaper and the bell sleeves of a simple cocktail sheath . (left) underlined the couture feel of the collection . Milan designers are offering more romantic looks rather than their trademark slinky and sexy. Long and loose pants were paired with ample tunic tops while voluminous long skirts offered a nice sweep. The accessories - high-heels and bags alike - often replicated patterns in the outfits. Hair styles were long and simple, either tucked up in a chignon or behind the ears. Over the next six days, more than 60 of Italy's top designers, including Gucci, Armani, Versace, Prada, Dolce & Gabbana, Fendi and Ferragamo will present their take on next summer's well-dressed woman. ‘Sophisticated and essential’  is how Gucci designer Frida Giannini described the elegant collection that kicked off Milan Fashion Week. Dreamy: Models walk the runway during the Mila Schoen catwalk show . Based on a simple elongated silhouette with artful cutouts and decorative flounces, accessorised by skinny high-heeled cage sandals and oversized 1970s costume jewellery, the collection came in bold shades of fuchsia, coral, kiwi green, mustard yellow and electric blue. Total black or total white underlined the couture feel of the collection, as did the delicate prints reminiscent of Japanese floral wallpaper, penthouse pyjama pants or the bell sleeves of a simple cocktail sheath. But Giannini is very much a contemporary designer, and her couture came with an edge. This is seen in the sophisticated ankle straps of the sandals decorated with the logo horse bit, the plexiglass clutch bag and the snakeskin patterns for evening wear. Next up was Alberta Ferretti, and the diaphanous, dainty and above all delicious collection for the spring-summer 2013 is sure to be a hit wherever sophisticated maidens gather, from beach clubs to garden parties to summer weddings. While a mega-screen projected silently moving water, model after model came down the runway wearing gowns so light they looked like a second skin. Diaphanous and dainty: The Alberta Ferretti catwalk show featured beautiful gowns of various colours, from pearly white to sea green and Mediterranean blue . With their hair gelled back as if they had just come out of the water and many gowns ending in a delicate train, the models looked like a parade of beautiful mermaids. The colours of the gowns ranged from pearly white to sea green and Mediterranean blue. Sometimes the light fabric was adorned with shimmering sequins, at others it came in dainty lace. Sheer nude tulle, which allowed the skin to shine through, held the gowns together, creating the mermaid effect. The overall look was young, demure and very special with every outfit unique. When asked what inspired the dreamy light look, the Italian designer said she felt the need to 'make up for the heavy moment we are all going through.' Meanwhile Mila Schoen dug into the archives for 1970s graphic prints for next year's warm weather looks. Bold: Mila Schoen's collection included vibrant pink colours . Jetting in: Supermodel Kate Moss attended an event at the Liu-Jo Boutique, in Milan on Wednesday . The collection at Milan Fashion Week featured zigzag, confetti or gum-wrapper prints in dreamy pastels or more vibrant pinks, sea-foam green or gold. Many of the daytime looks were two pieces, allowing for endless combinations and coverage. Cropped tops were shown over belted short skirts that flair, long-sleeved tunic tops were over super-wide trousers for an elegant, all-covered feel. Designer Bianca Gervasio played with volume, accenting short skirts with a pair of inverted pleats on each hip for a bubble effect that contrasted with tighter fitting bodices, sometimes off the shoulder or with cap sleeves. And Gervasio turned the volume way up for evening wear, offering romantic flowing pleated or tiered skirts that swept along the floor. The evening colour palate was mostly pastels, a soft pink skirt with an ivory off-the-shoulder top, pulled together by a belt accented with crystals.

"Leading by example: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he would consider hiring a convicted criminal in a bid to encourage other employers to do the same . They say crime doesn’t pay, but it would appear the experts don’t agree. One in five offenders have told an official government survey they agree with the statement ‘in the end crime does pay’. The Ministry of Justice survey of nearly 3,000 criminals on community service found one in five also accepted that crime ‘can be a useful way of getting what you want’. And it revealed the extent to which law-breakers are in denial about their lives. Three-quarters of those surveyed said they didn’t see themselves as a ‘real criminal’. One in four said they thought many crimes were in fact ‘not really wrong’, and around same proportion said their crimes have ‘never harmed anyone’. The vast majority also have high expectations for their ability to break their habit: nearly eight in ten disagreed with the statement ‘once a criminal, always a criminal’. However, separate figures released yesterday by the same department showed the staggering extent of reoffending by prison inmates. The average prisoner, the figures revealed, has some 41 crimes to their name. Chris Grayling published the data as he launched new plans to slash reoffending and end what he called the ‘depressing Merry-go-round’ of crime. The Justice Secretary announced he wants more criminals to find jobs when they get out of prison. And he is considering setting an example by hiring one to work in his own office. In a major speech to the Civitas think tank, Mr Grayling urged companies and the public sector - including the NHS - to hire convicted criminals. And, asked by an charity for ex-offenders if he would consider taking on one in the Ministry of Justice he agreed it was right to ‘lead from the front’. Mr Grayling said: ‘I’m very up for the idea of looking to see where we can find more educational or work opportunities for former offenders and of course we should lead from the front with that. Crime and punishment: The Ministry of Justice survey of nearly 3,000 criminals on community service found one in five thought that crime 'can be a useful way of getting what you want' ‘We’re a big organisation that does . an awful lot of things and there’s no reason why we shouldn’t look to . find opportunities within the organisation that are right for them.’ Mr Grayling hailed the results of a ‘very promising’ pilot programme in which ex-cons mentored current inmates. The project in Peterborough Prison saw a five per cent lower reconviction rate than the national average. If repeated across the country it could reduce crime by some 30,000 offences a year. Mr Grayling said there was no reason why ex-offenders could not find positions in the public sector, including the NHS. He said: ‘I see no reason why a former . offender cannot do an apprenticeship course and end up in a technical . role, in NHS logistics for example. Reformed: Mr Grayling introduced plans to slash reoffending and end what he called the 'depressing merry-go-round' of crime . ‘We have employers across the board willing to give offenders a chance and it’s in all of our interest to ensure that someone who has been to prison gets a chance to get into employment when they leave and not re-offend again.’ The cost of reoffending is put at between nine and 13 billion pounds a year. Mr Grayling said: ‘When you find out that the person who burgled you, the person who attacked you in the street, has already been round the system scores of times, you’re entitled to ask why the system didn’t do more to prevent you getting hurt, as others had before you.’ He added: ‘Britain’s problem is less about offending and more about re-offending' In a radical reform of the £2billion probation service, private companies and charities will be paid by results for helping to reform repeat criminals.","Almost 80 per cent disagreed with saying 'once a criminal, always a criminal'

"A one-legged drugs trafficker was caught by customs officials in Spain, who found more than a kilo of cocaine stashed in his false limb. Police at the airport in Madrid became suspicious of the man and an accomplice when they arrived on a flight from Panama on Sunday looking nervous. 'It was just a hunch but one based on experience,' said one official. The dismantled prosthetic leg, stripped down to where the cocaine was kept in the centre . The carefully taped up layer inside the foam, where the smugglers flying in from Panama hid their package . 'When we searched them we found two bags of cocaine taped inside one of the suspect's prosthetic leg,' they added. Both men from Peru have been held on drugs trafficking charges. In an incident on June 4 at the same airport, an airport employee and a passenger arriving from Peru were both arrested for trying to smuggle 10kilos of cocaine. The problem with cocaine smuggling has been an ongoing struggle for Spanish authorities. Once customs peeled off the top layer of plastic they realised it was no ordinary artificial limb . How the limb looked when the smugglers arrived at Madrid's Barajas airport . In March, 55 kilos of cocaine were uncovered in the luggage of three passengers who arrived on a flight from Lima. Last year, police detained 398 people at Barajas airport for drug smuggling. It is particularly difficult for authorities at the airport as over 45 million passengers passed through last year.","Police at Spain's busiest airport arrested two drug smugglers on Tuesday .

"Ed Miliband has hired a  controversial American election guru on a six-figure salary to help him campaign on the cost of living and his vow to freeze energy prices. David Axelrod – who helped to mastermind Barack Obama’s two presidential election wins – is notorious in the US for a highly-criticised campaign to raise electricity bills. It is an embarrassing link for the Labour leader who has made a 20-month freeze on fuel prices a key promise ahead of next year’s election. Mr Miliband said in his last party conference speech: ‘Gas and electric companies that put prices up and up and up. It’s not good for an economy.’ Ed Miliband's new spin chief David Axelrod (left) pictured beside Barack Obama (centre) as he ran for president in September 2008 . Mr Axelrod’s firm was accused of trying to deceive voters in the US by producing adverts claiming that without a hefty  price hike, the lights would go off. Ostensibly, these adverts were produced by a group of local citizens and businesses in Illinois called Consumers Organized for Reliable Electricity. In fact, the whole campaign was a front for the state’s largest power supplier, ComEd, which paid Mr Axelrod’s lobbying company, ASK Public Strategies, £8million to build support for the price rise in 2006. When his firm’s involvement was revealed it caused a political storm, with Illinois’s Democratic governor Pat Quinn saying: ‘It’s corporate money trying to hoodwink the public’. Yesterday Labour hailed the hiring of Mr Axelrod as a major coup following a narrowing of their lead in the polls and claims that their cost of living message will lose momentum as the economy recovers. Labour leader Ed Miliband (pictured) hired David Axelrod who came up with Barack Obama's campaign slogan 'yes we can' Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary who is in charge of the election campaign, said that energy would be a key part of the message. Mr Axelrod’s appointment follows a trend for bringing expensive strategists from abroad. The Tories have hired Australian spin doctor Lynton Crosby to help them win the election in a reported £500,000 deal, and Nick Clegg hired South African Ryan Coetzee as a £110,000 adviser. But not everyone welcomed the decision. Labour’s Baroness Prosser, a former party treasurer, told the BBC she was ‘not that enthusiastic’. She said: ‘I can’t really see how a decision has been made to spend that six-figure sum on one person when what we really need is lots and lots of organisation going on around and about in the country to turn out the vote. ‘If we don’t get people coming out of their houses and voting on polling day then we are not going to win.’ Mr Axelrod has apparently not met Mr Miliband in person, but believes he can win. He claimed in an interview: ‘Ed Miliband understands the struggle that people are going through in Britain to make a living wage, to support their families, to retire with some dignity. He understands that a growing economy demands that you have broad prosperity and not just prosperity that’s hoarded by a few.’ It was Mr Axelrod who persuaded a reluctant Mr Obama to accept the ‘Yes We Can’ slogan in the 2008 presidential election. That campaign swept Mr Obama to the White House on a wave of heady optimism and rhetoric. Six years on, that bold pledge seems a very hollow boast to most Americans and has become a millstone round Mr Obama’s neck. But Mr Axelrod, the product of a Left-wing family in New York,  will have no regrets. His task was simply to get his man into office. In the White House, Mr Obama made Mr Axelrod a senior adviser but, it later emerged, he and other aides soon clashed with Michelle Obama, who was trying to interfere in policymaking. Although he was credited with once again heading Mr Obama’s campaign strategy in the 2012 election, a well-sourced book last year revealed that he had been pushed out during the campaign following a civil war with other senior officials. They had been particularly upset, it was claimed, when Mr Axelrod hired a lawyer to negotiate a sweetheart deal that made him rich by taking a small percentage of the cost of every TV advert run by the Obama campaign in 2012.","David Axelrod came up with Barack Obama's campaign slogan 'Yes We Can'

"However much they whisper in the shadows about his future as Rangers manager, Ally McCoist’s reputation as a true survivor remains intact. In the week in which the city’s rumour mongers have been working overtime, what was already another stern test of his credentials seemed to take on new proportions. The slender victory, courtesy of Lewis MacLeod’s flashing header four minutes from time, is unlikely to see McCoist handed a fresh long-term deal by new powerbroker Mike Ashley by the time the week is out — but nor will it do him any harm, either. Lewis MacLeod celebrates his fine header with just four minutes to go to secure Rangers' win at Ibrox . As winter grips, McCoist can now point to a League Cup semi-final in three months’ time as further evidence of tangible progress under him. Celtic may even lie in store. With his side now up to five wins on the spin since losing at home to Hibs in the Championship, he is at least in a better place than this time last month. Not for the first time, his timing might just prove to be impeccable. In front of a paltry crowd and under the watchful eye of Ashley’s right-hand man Derek Llambias, McCoist’s team were not at their best. They did not have to be. Former Newcastle Director Derek Llambias (left) was in the stands after becoming a Rangers consultant . Rangers captain Lee McCulloch rises above the St Johnstone defence as he attempts to head his side in front . Tommy Wright’s St Johnstone looked for all the world like a team who believed they were facing the Rangers of 10 years ago. They gave far too much respect to their opponents and could have little complaint that their dream of adding the League Cup to the Scottish Cup they won in May is at an end. As a player with the club in the barren days of the early 80s, McCoist would have occasionally experienced Ibrox when populated by sparse crowds. Even allowing for the TV coverage, apathy and what is seemingly an ongoing unofficial fans boycott, last night’s attendance of 13,023 was truly startling. As the team’s emerged, you had to remind yourself this was a League Cup quarter-final tie. And one at the start of a new chapter for Rangers at that. Veteran Rangers striker Kenny Miller tries to tackle Christopher Millar at the corner flag at Ibrox on Tuesday . There had certainly been precious little to encourage the home fans on such occasions since liquidation in 2012. Of the five subsequent matches against teams from higher divisions, Rangers had won just two. Saints scarcely arrived with a bullish mind-set, though. Wright’s men had been more than happy to leave Partick with a point at the weekend having stopped the rot of five straight league losses. They started brightly enough. Brian Graham ran off the effects of a late Ian Black clogging to fire a yard past Steve Simonsen’s goal from 20 yards. Michael O’Halloran, selected ahead of James McFadden, bounded towards the by-line and picked out the darting figure of Simon Lappin. Only the diligence of Richard Foster prevented a certain goal. Nicky Law (left) is challenged by Christopher Millar as Rangers managed to prevail in the Scottish League Cup . The early exchanges were worthy of a wider audience. Fraser Aird’s cross from the right presented Kenny Miller with a difficult chance and the veteran’s ambitious scissor-kick never threatened Alan Mannus. When Lewis Macleod combined pace on the turn with precision passing on the half-way line, Kris Boyd was left a free run at the visitors’ goal. Mannus spread himself well to block although the striker ought to have done better. Saints’ were forced into a rethink midway through the first period when Murray Davidson was stretchered off following an accidental clash with Lee McCulloch. Gary McDonald was sprung from the bench. Often Rangers’ killer instinct was not what it might have been. When O’Halloran played Steven Anderson into trouble, Aird had a host of options both left and right yet was calmly dispossessed by Brian Easton. Kenny Miller loses possession on Tuesday but helped Rangers reach the League Cup semi-final . There was little to choose between the sides in the opening period yet, by virtue of their stronger finish, St Johnstone were left nursing the greater sense of grievance. Lee Wallace sold Macleod short with a ball out from the back. Lee Croft leapt upon it and having ghosted to the byline saw Frazer Wright out of the corner of his eye. The defender rose well to connect yet, to his manager’s chagrin, failed to direct his header on target. O’Halloran was relishing his floating role and when he produced another excellent delivery from the right, only Foster stood between Graham and a likely opening goal. Rangers keeper Steve Simonsen clatters into the post during Rangers' League Cup clash with St Johnstone . The 35-year-old was taken to hospital after the collision early in the second half at Ibrox . Chris Millar’s expertly-controlled volley gave Simonsen food for thought on the cusp of half-time but the breakthrough proved elusive. Boyd was threatening one of those nights. When Macleod’s incisive pass picked him out seconds after the turnaround, he looked odds-on to score only for Easton to block. St Johnstone were equally as profligate. Having shown Foster a clean pair of heels, O’Halloran opted to go for goal rather than square for Graham. Simonsen’s outstretched arm maintained parity. It was to prove the keeper’s final involvement of the night. Simon Lappin’s in-swinging free-kick was guided towards the bottom corner by Graham. Simonsen saved well yet could not prevent himself colliding with the post at full pelt. As he was stretchered off, Lee Robinson was brought on for his first Rangers’ appearance in eight years. MacLeod rose highest in the St Johnstone penalty area to score a vital seventh goal of the season for Rangers . The Rangers squad celebrate the late winner for Ally McCoist's side to go into the League Cup semi-final . His first involvement was almost calamitous. With no need to leave his line, he dashed to meet O’Halloran close to the right touchline. Having lost the race, his relief at seeing the Saints man stumble and lose his footing with a clear sight of goal was considerable. Despite the tiring legs on both sides, openings proved to be more at a premium the longer the game wore on. Lee McCulloch did manage to succeed in finding the net with 10 minutes remaining with an impressive headed conversion of Macleod’s free-kick but the veteran was adjudged to have strayed offside. Rangers manager All McCoist can't hide his delight as MacLeod's header proves to be the winner . But just as the spectre of extra-time loomed large, Rangers struck. Aird’s crossing had been erratic all night but with four minutes left he produced a peach. Cutting back on to his favoured right foot, he whipped an in-swinger over the visiting defence. Macleod rose, connected sweetly and the tie was as good as over. Black almost made it two with a raking drive from 25 yards that Mannus tipped over but the solitary goal was sufficient. MacLeod runs to celebrate in front of the Ibrox faithful as his team-mates congratulate his fine header .","Lewis Macleod scores late header to put Rangers into the semi-finals .

"The Beverly Hills Hotel has been handed a lifeline by actor Russell Crowe, after he announced that he didn't support the Hollywood boycott that has crippled business. The star wrote on Twitter that didn't agree with the boycott as it hits hard-working staff he considers  his 'friends'. Once known as the place 'to be seen', the hotel has been almost empty in recent weeks after its owner, the Sultan of Brunei, introduced Sharia law in his country, which calls for homosexuals to be stoned to death. Star support: Russell Crowe tweeted that he did not agree with the boycott of The Beverly Hills Hotel . Dissension: Russell Crowe said he did not agree with the hotel boycott . A growing group of stars, from Ellen DeGeneres to Sharon Osbourne and Stephen Fry - and even Kim Kardashian - have boycotted the Dorchester Collection in protest at the law. While Fry cancelled his visit to Coworth Park, near Ascot, which is owned by the group along with The Dorchester and 45 Park Lane in London as well as luxury hotels in Paris, Geneva, Milan and Rome, others have said they will avoid all the hotels in the chain. Scroll down for video . In the pink: The Beverly Hills Hotel has been a favourite retreat of Hollywood stars since it opened in 1912 - but has found itself at the centre of protests against its owner, the Sultan of Brunei, and Brunei's new anti-gay laws . A gathering storm: Celebrities such as comedian Jay Leno have led protests outside the Beverly Hills Hotel . Hollywood stars have in turn focused on The Beverly Hills Hotel, the revered 102-year-old retreat that is loved by the rich and famous. But Gladiator star Crowe tweeeted his support for workers on Monday, saying: 'I don't agree with the boycotting of Dorchester Collection hotels. It only hurts the hard working staff who I consider friends.' His message was greet with support on Twitter, with 102 people rewteeted the comment and 274 'favouriting' the tweet. However, not everyone agreed with the star. Scott Holleran ‏tweeted: 'Maybe you should watch Gladiator again for a refresher in what it truly means to persecute innocent people.' Kevin Kane added: . 'I am married to a gay Bruniean. Giving money to the Sultan is support. Boycott leads to media interest and political pressure.' Coming under fire: Protestors have been gathering outside the Beverly Hills Hotel all week . Reality star Kim Kardashian is said to have cancelled her bridal shower at the hotel, while the Motion Picture & Television Fund said it will no longer hold its annual ‘Night Before the Oscars’ party at the hotel. The Fund said it was making a protest at Brunei’s new sharia criminal law, which punishes same-sex relationships, as well as adultery and abortions, with flogging and stoning. ‘We cannot condone or tolerate these harsh and repressive laws, and as a result support a business owned by the Sultan of Brunei or a Brunei sovereign fund associated with the government of Brunei,’ the Fund's directors said in a statement. Flashpoint: The Dorchester Collection, which runs the Beverly Hills Hotel, says the current protests are misdirected . Prominent figures such as comedians Ellen DeGeneres and Jay Leno, and entrepreneur Richard Branson, have been among those to advocate shunning the hotel and its bungalows – a favoured locale for the Hollywood elite since it opened its doors in 1912. Divisive: Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah's new anti-gay laws have sparked outrage . Branson tweeted that no member of his Virgin staff would stay at any Dorchester Collection property – the hotel group which includes the Beverly Hills Hotel, and is owned by Brunei – ‘until the Sultan abides by basic human rights.’ Mavis Leno, co-chair of the Global Women's Rights Awards with husband Jay Leno, said the new penalties ‘violate international law and have no place in civilised society.’ In an added move, the City of Beverly Hills voted to pressure the government of Brunei into selling the Beverly Hills Hotel in the wake of its new laws. Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah has praised his state's laws as a ‘great achievement.’ Brunei, a conservative country where alcohol is banned and Muslim courts already govern family affairs, has begun phasing in its version of sharia law, which allows for penalties such as amputation for theft and stoning for adultery. The most severe punishments – flogging, amputation and stoning – are to be introduced over the next two years. Response: Comedian Ellen Degeneres and entrepreneur Richard Branson have been vocal in their opposition . The Dorchester Collection's chief executive has said that the hotel boycott is misdirected. ‘American companies across the board are funded by foreign investment, including sovereign wealth funds,' Christopher Cowdray said in a statement. The Beverly Hills Hotel has played host to a constellation of stars in its 102-year history. Leading lights such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, John Wayne, Faye Dunaway and The Beatles have all stayed or partied amid the property's inimitable pink walls.","Stars have abandoned the hotel, which is owned by the Sultan of Brunei .

"Tony and Cherie Blair have sold a house for £860,000 more than they paid for it just four years ago. The sum is vastly more than anything they have made from previous property sales. The ‘stunning’ three-bedroom Georgian townhouse in Central London was bought in 2010 for their son Euan. Scroll down for video . Tony and Cherie Blair have sold a house for £860,000 more than they paid for it just four years ago . The Blairs paid £1,290,000, but have now sold it for £2,150,000. It means the property went up in value by an average of £17,200 a month for the 50 months they owned it – more than seven times the average monthly wage in Britain. In the past five years they have sold four of their properties for a total profit of £1,308,499. Yet they still own nine more homes, now estimated to be worth a total of £30million. Euan’s house was sold because he is moving to an even bigger one. After marrying last year, he and his wife Suzanne, 26, are doing up a £3.6million Grade II-listed townhouse with four bedrooms and a playroom. They will move in once expensive refurbishments have been completed, including a £100,000 Bulthaup kitchen, as favoured by celebrities such as Robbie Williams and Kim Kardashian. The Blairs recently complemented the six-storey property in Central London by buying a £1.2million mews cottage immediately behind it. The ‘stunning’ three-bedroom Georgian townhouse in Central London was bought in 2010 for their son Euan . There is no mention of Suzanne’s name on the title deeds of her new home. The townhouse was bought jointly by Euan and Cherie, 59, while the mews cottage is owned solely by Cherie. £5.75m, Buckinghamshire: Grade I-listed manor house bought in 2008.

One since sold for £260,000 . The two houses are back-to-back and have interlocking floors in a rear extension block which could in theory be knocked through to create a single five-bedroom home. The house where 30-year-old Euan used to live has been sold to a leading solicitor and his wife. It was marketed as ‘a stunning, freehold, Georgian townhouse which has been totally refurbished and also extended’. The advertisement read: ‘The property offers 1,707sq ft of accommodation arranged as three/four reception rooms, three bedrooms and, on the lower ground floor, accommodation that would be ideal for a nanny or a work place.’ Since leaving Downing Street in 2007, the Blairs have amassed a property empire. The millionaire couple have bought homes for their three eldest children, although the ones for Nicky, 28, and Kathryn, 26, cost considerably less at £1.35million and £975,000 respectively. Euan married Suzanne last September at South Pavilion, the Blairs’ Grade I-listed mansion in Buckinghamshire which is now said to be worth £9million. Earlier this year, Mr Blair, who earns millions of pounds a year from his consultancy roles and charges fees of £250,000 for public speaking, was forced to deny being motivated by money. He insisted: ‘Reports of my wealth are greatly exaggerated. I read I’m supposed to be worth £100million – Cherie’s kind of asking where it is. I’m not worth that, half of that, a third of that, a quarter of that, a fifth of that... I could go on.’ Mr Blair was recently named philanthropist of the year by GQ magazine in recognition of his ‘philanthropy, establishing three charities’.","Tony and Cherie Blair sell Central London townhouse for £2.15million .

"Watching him cavort with dancers and beauty queens on his recent Caribbean tour, it was hard to picture Prince Harry as a lonely heart. But the soul-searching young prince has revealed his fear that women are scared off by his ‘job’ in the Royal Family and said he sometimes longed to be ‘normal’. Although at 27 he is one of the world’s most eligible bachelors, Harry hinted that he has struggled to find a girlfriend who was willing to take on a public role at his side. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Lonely: Prince Harry hinted in an interview with an American news channel that he is struggling to find someone willing to fulfil the role as his Princess . In a candid interview on U.S. television, he was asked if being royal lived up to its image. Laughing, . he replied: ‘No, not at all, ha ha – as any girl would ever tell you. It’s sort of, “Oh my God, he’s a prince”. But no. The job that it . entails – I mean look at me, I’m 27 years old.’ On his chances of marriage, he added: ‘I’m not so much searching for . someone to fulfil the role, but obviously, you know, finding  someone . that would be willing to take it on.’ Harry’s only long-term relationship was with Chelsy Davy, 26, and finished in 2009 after five years. The Zimbabwean-born blonde, now a trainee solicitor, made it clear she . did not want a life of official duties and shortly after the split Harry . was spotted taking socialite Astrid Harbord back to Clarence House . after a night out. Former flame: Prince Harry kisses his former girlfriend Chelsy during a concert in memory of his mother in July 2007. The couple split two years later . Split: Prince Harry with Chelsy Davy after receiving his Flying Wings from his father, the Prince of Wales. The trainee pilot has admitted being a royal is not a fairytale . He has been linked with other women, including television presenters . Natalie Pinkham and Caroline Flack, and lingerie model Florence . Brudenell-Bruce, but none has led to a lasting relationship. Instead, . like Prince Andrew before him, Harry has appeared to revel in his . freedom as a younger brother, without the responsibility of being a . future king. Harry said he and William were ‘slowly coming to terms’ with the reality . of life as senior members of the Royal Family, as they begin to take on . some of the Queen’s duties. They both accept their responsibilities, he . said, but often long to  exchange palaces and prestige for being ‘just . completely normal’. Prince Harry gave the thumbs up as Brazilian model Fernanda Motta approached him after playing polo for the Sentebale team in Brazil .

It really is that simple for us.’ Harry’s high profile has caused him frustration when he has sought to . persuade defence chiefs to let him return to a front-line role in the . Army. The prince said it was ‘ridiculous’ for critics to argue that his royal . status should stop him from returning to active service as an Apache . pilot, and insisted he wanted to do another tour in Afghanistan. ‘All these people talking, these stories, “Ah, he’s been trained as an . Apache pilot, he’s never going to see active service, he’s never going . to get to the front line”. ‘These people live in a ridiculous world to even think that. Especially . with our Army nowadays, you can’t train people and not put them in the . role they need to play. I want to serve my country. As I’m still in the . Army I feel I should get the opportunity to do it again.’ Linked: Trainee pilot Harry was rumoured to have been seeing TV presenter Caroline Flack in 2009 and later  had a brief relationship with lingerie model Florence Brudenell-Bruce who he broke up with in August last year . At his brother's wedding to Kate Middleton in April rumours circulated that Harry was more interested in flirting with maid of honour Pippa than watching Prince William take his vows . Harry said he had been honoured to act as an official representative of . the Queen, and overwhelmed by the public response to his visits. ‘These are countries that don’t take themselves too seriously. They . enjoy life. Everything’s fun, and you’ve just got to go along with it. 'You can’t just sit there with your arms crossed and wearing a tie or . whatever. You’ve got to relax, go with the flow.’ The prince revealed he is planning to help his grandmother celebrate her . Diamond Jubilee with a night out, hosted by himself, William and their . cousins Peter, Zara, Beatrice and Eugenie. ‘As her grandchildren, we’ll . hopefully have a dinner and do something fun, maybe take her out on the . town.’ Prince Harry stands behind the Queen at St George's Chapel in Windsor in 2008.

"Barack Obama is embraced by his wife Michelle after his victory speech . A deeply divided America faced up to another four years of political acrimony yesterday despite Barack Obama’s victory promise that ‘the best is yet to come’. After his triumph over Mitt Romney, Mr Obama joined his rival in calling for an end to the bitter partisan divide that has engulfed not only Washington but the wider country. For all the brave talk after this ‘status quo election’, Mr Obama returns to Washington to find the same divided Congress, with defiant Republicans still in control of the House of Representatives. And despite a convincing victory in the Electoral College – in which he has so far won at least 303 votes to Mr Romney’s 206 – the president will have trouble claiming a sweeping mandate after he secured only a 2 per cent lead in the popular vote. Last night the stock markets reflected these fears as Wall Street slumped, with some £60billion wiped off share prices. And hours after a triumphant Mr Obama told an ecstatic crowd in Chicago he was ‘more determined and inspired than ever’, senior Republicans were already warning that they will keep fighting for lower taxes and deep spending cuts to spur economic growth and cut America’s debt. ‘The voters have not endorsed the failures or excesses of the president’s first term,’ said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell icily. The US could be plunged back into recession as soon as January if politicians fail to come together to address the ‘fiscal cliff’ of scheduled huge spending cuts and tax increases of almost £1trillion. Unlike four years ago when Mr Obama became the first black president, this election is historic for a rather less inspiring reason. No White House incumbent since Franklin D Roosevelt during the Great Depression has won re-election with unemployment – at 7.9 percent – so high. Senator Mitch McConnell, left, said that voters have 'not endorsed the failures' of Obama's first term in office, with the President the first to be re-elected with unemployment so high since Franklin D Roosevelt, right, during the Great Depression . Much of Mr Obama’s success is being laid on the failure of Mr Romney to capitalise on 12.3million jobless Americans. In the event, after a 17-month campaign that was the most expensive in US history at £3billion, very little has changed. The political map of the US remains almost exactly how it was in 2008, as Mr Romney failed to oust the Democrats in the crucial swing states which the president dramatically won in 2008. Mr Romney, whose political career is effectively over after two White House bids, urged American unity in a gracious concession speech in the early hours of Wednesday. He told a hushed 2,000-strong crowd that America had to put ‘people before politics’, adding: ‘At a time like this we can’t risk partisan bickering and political posturing.’ Defeated Republican Presidential candidate graciously called for unity in America in his concession speech . Half an hour later, as Democrats celebrated with relief rather than the breathless jubilation of 2008, Mr Obama gave his own speech. Rediscovering some of the soaring rhetoric missing during much of his campaign, Mr Obama insisted the battle against Mr Romney had made him a better president. Joined on stage by wife Michelle and their children, he echoed Mr Romney’s call to find consensus with opponents – a pledge he also made in 2008 with little success – but admitted fierce political disagreement would continue. Such arguments were ‘a mark of our liberty’ denied to millions, he said, adding: ‘Despite all the frustrations of Washington I have never been more hopeful about our future.’ Preliminary figures suggest a  drop in voter turnout. More than 118million are known to have cast their vote and that will rise as counting continues – but it is predicted the total will fall far short of the 131million in 2008, according to the Federal Election Commission. Results: State by state . Pedestrians walk in the rain past the New York Stock Exchange the day after President Barack Obama was re-elected . Wall Street went into freefall last night as investors woke up to the reality that Barack Obama’s victory had done nothing to resolve America’s huge budget problems. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 300 points – or £60billion – its biggest decline in 2012 and the largest setback since November 2011 when US financiers feared that the US recovery could be snuffed out by the crisis in the eurozone. The adverse reaction of Wall Street to the outcome of the elections, that leave the President and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives at loggerheads over America’s huge deficit and debt, spread across the Atlantic wiping 93.27 points, or 1.58 per cent, off the FTSE100 share index in London. Tension on the markets increased after investment bankers Goldman Sachs lowered its forecast for US growth next year from 1.9 per cent to 1.5 per cent. The credit ratings agency Fitch warned that unless the President speedily secures an agreement to overcome the ‘fiscal cliff’ – that would automatically take $600billion out of the economy through budget cuts and tax increases – it would lower its credit rating from its top ‘AAA’ status. ‘It’s not as simple as Mitt Romney lost so the stock market falls,’ said the Wall Street firm BMO Capital Markets. ‘Right now it is back to business in America and that’s tied up to the fiscal cliff and taxes.’ In contrast, however, the dollar strengthened against the pound and the euro in reaction to a sharp fall in Spanish industrial production and reports of a slowdown in Germany. There has been a realisation on Wall Street that the election has not changed America’s budgetary crisis at all and despite all the talk of bipartisanship, Congress and the White House are as bitterly divided as ever. If a compromise cannot be reached, existing legislation would require the White House to slash spending and increase taxes by almost £400billion in a punishing move that could wipe out up to 3 per cent of growth and push the United States and much of the world – including Britain – back into recession. Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner, has already signalled his post-election departure . Mr Obama’s task is not made any easier by uncertainty over the future shape of his economic team. The current Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner, has already signalled his post-election departure. In choosing his replacement, many believe he should appoint a high-profile figure from the financial community. The name of Roger Altman, a Clinton-era deputy Treasury secretary and co-founder of the investment firm Evercore has been mentioned. So has that of Larry Fink, who runs the world’s biggest investor Black Rock. If Mr Obama goes for a Washington insider, then it is thought that Jack Lew, the current White House chief of staff, would be in the frame. President Clinton’s former head of staff Erksine Bowles, with a record of dealing with Capitol Hill, is also seen as a favoured candidate.","Both Mr Obama and rival Mitt Romney called for an end to the bitter partisan divide that has engulfed America .

"Jewellery tycoon: Ranbir Singh Suri was made a peer because he is a 'leading figure' among Sikhs . He's the Tory party donor who was made a peer because he is a ‘leading figure’ among Sikhs. The only problem is, other prominent Sikhs say they have never heard of Ranbir Singh Suri. The jewellery tycoon – dubbed the King of Bling – was elevated to the House of Lords by David Cameron last week after giving the Conservatives £310,000. Tory chiefs dismissed cries of ‘cash for peerages’ by saying he was a pillar of the Sikh community. But yesterday there was embarrassment for the party when the Sikh  community begged to differ. ‘We have not come across this individual before,’ said Gurmel Singh, secretary general of the Sikh Council UK, the largest Sikh representative body in the country. ‘The first time I heard of him was when his name was mentioned [as a new peer].’ Lord Suri, 79, was described by Downing Street as a businessman and ‘former general secretary of the Board of British Sikhs’. But records show the Board has not existed for more than 20 years. It ran for just two years and involved only four or five people. According to documents at Companies House, it was incorporated in 1990 and dissolved two years later, with insiders telling The Independent it ‘fizzled out’ after a couple of meetings. Tory claims that the donor had ‘leading’ status within his community were dismissed as a ‘barefaced lie’ by another prominent Sikh organisation. The Sikh Federation (UK) said in a statement: ‘He is no leading figure in Britain’s Sikh community and he is not associated with any of the leading Sikh organisations. Many in the Sikh community simply see Lord Suri as a businessman who has donated large sums of money [to the Tories].’ Action: He was elevated to the House of Lords by David Cameron (pictured) after giving the Tories £310,000 . It added: ‘The Federation has been campaigning for over a decade for more visible Sikhs in  Parliament. On the one hand this move is welcome, but we would prefer each of the main political parties to have Sikhs in the House of Lords who are younger, there on merit and based on what they have to offer rather than those who are seen as “cronies”.’ There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing on the part of Lord Suri, who was a magistrate for more than a decade. He built Oceanic Jewellers into an international success story after establishing it in 1976 and in 2009 his family’s fortune was estimated to be £40million. Claims: Gurmel Singh (pictured), secretary general of the Sikh Council UK, said 'we have not come across this individual before' He is now one of Britain’s richest Asians who has regularly featured in the Sunday Times Rich List. A member of the Renaissance Forum, an exclusive dinner club open only to those who have donated more than £10,000 to the party, he has been an active member of the Conservative Party for more than 30 years and describes Mr Cameron as ‘delightful and a good leader’. However, Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi said last night: ‘There are questions to answer here, not least for the Government who, on elevating this Tory donor to the Lords, justified it on the basis that he held a post which doesn’t seem to have existed for over a decade.’ She questioned whether the suitability of the appointment was discussed with the House of Lords Appointments Commission, which vets nominations for new peerages. ‘People will rightly want to get to the bottom of this issue before another Tory donor is sworn in to the Lords,’ she added. The Appointments Commission said its job was limited to checking an individual’s ‘propriety’. A spokesman stressed: ‘Assessing the suitability of those nominated by political parties is a matter for the parties themselves.’ Lord Suri’s peerage will lead to further calls for the controversial system of patronage to be scrapped. The Prime Minister has now handed out more than 180 peerages, swelling the total to 850 – making the House of Lords bigger than at any time since most hereditary seats were removed in 1999. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Beyond his extensive career in business, Ranbir Suri has devoted the last 40 years to a range of charitable and voluntary positions, including General Secretary of the Board of British Sikhs in 1991/92.’ Lord Suri’s office said he was unavailable for comment. But a family friend said: ‘He is a prominent member of the Sikh community, because he is rich, but he is not a leader of it, and nor would he ever claim to be. ‘He is an extremely humble man who arrived as an immigrant from Kenya in 1973 with very little and worked hard to build himself a business.’","Ranbi Singh Suri elevated to House of Lords by David Cameron last week .

"The parents of a dying baby girl watched in anguish as a doctor broke off from trying to resuscitate her to answer his phone. As 33-day-old Isabellina fought for life, consultant Dr Nigel Kennea took the call about another patient and left the baby in the care of a nurse. Isabellina, who was born prematurely and had developed severe complications, died a few minutes later. Fighter: Joanna Brewerton cuddles her baby daughter Isabellina at eight days old. Isabellina arrived 13 weeks prematurely at East Surrey Hospital on September 28 last year. Weighing just 2lb 2oz, she was transferred to the neonatal unit at St George’s Hospital in south London . Yesterday her grief-stricken parents described their shock at seeing the neonatologist answer his phone during the desperate battle to save their baby. Mother Joanna Brewerton, a marketing executive, said: ‘We were standing there watching in panic and horror as our daughter’s life ebbed away. It is a moment so awful it is hard to describe. ‘Then his phone went. It wasn’t ringing, it was vibrating. It was buzzing in his pocket for quite a long time and then he pulled it out and was looking at it while it was still buzzing. He turned to the nurse and said, “Oh, I’ve got to take this”. As 33-day-old Isabellina fought for life, consultant Dr Nigel Kennea (above) took the call about another patient and left the baby in the care of a nurse. Isabellina, who had developed severe complications, died a few minutes later. File picture . ‘And he did. He put down the “tom thumb” [a device used to help resuscitate babies]. He was the only doctor in the room and he turned his back. He walked to the back of the room.’ Dr Kennea has apologised to the couple for being insensitive, and the hospital said the phone call he took was ‘vital’ to save the life of another baby under his care. Isabellina arrived 13 weeks prematurely at East Surrey Hospital on September 28 last year. Weighing just 2lb 2oz, she was transferred to the neonatal unit at St George’s Hospital in South London. Miss Brewerton and her partner, accountant Kevin Bennett, both 43 and from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, kept a cot-side vigil. But their baby, whose heart was no bigger than a five pence piece, developed a condition called necrotising enterocolitis and suddenly deteriorated on October 30. Medical staff tried to save her for more than an hour, before Dr Kennea’s phone rang. Isabellina died soon afterwards, having suffered multiple organ failure. Later the couple, who have two other children, Isaias, five, and two-year-old Isadora, held a meeting with a panel of doctors including Dr Kennea. Miss Brewerton said: ‘He initially did not remember taking the phone call. He went white as soon as I accused him of it. A St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust spokesman said: 'Staff are permitted to take urgent patient-related calls whilst treating other patients' ‘He swiped through the calls on his phone and said, “Oh, I did take a call”. I just lost it. I kept saying the same thing, “Who was more important than my daughter’s life?” and “Why could you not have handed that phone to another member of staff?” ‘I badgered him. He apologised and then he couldn’t stop apologising and he was still apologising as we left the room.’ The hospital carried out an investigation and concluded that the taking of the phone call ‘would not have made any difference’ to Isabellina’s death. Dr Andy Rhodes, who chaired the inquiry, said: ‘Dr Kennea was coordinating the care of many sick patients that night and thus having clear lines of communication were of the utmost priority. ‘By the time Dr Kennea took the phone call, the severity of her condition was so poor that Isabellina was not going to survive. Dr Kennea was not alone in the room that night and handed over the ongoing resuscitation to other appropriately skilled and competent members of staff.’ In a letter to Isabellina’s family, hospital chief executive Miles Scott wrote: ‘The panel considered this carefully and concluded it had no bearing on her death. However they fully recognise it appeared insensitive and gave the wrong impression ... an impression that upset you both greatly, and for which Dr Kennea has offered his sincere apologies.’ Cambridge-educated Dr Kennea is a renowned neonatal specialist whose research has won him awards. In a statement to the Mail, Mr Scott added: ‘Dr Kennea and his team did all they could for Isabellina. We repeat our sympathies to her family and are continuing our dialogue.’ A St George’s Healthcare NHS Trust spokesman said: ‘Staff are permitted to take urgent patient-related calls whilst treating other patients. ‘In the case of Baby I [Isabellina], one of the medical team treating her took such a call from another doctor about the urgent care of another sick baby. It was brief and, as an independent expert review has concluded, taking the call had no bearing on the outcome.’","Dr Nigel Kennea had been trying to resuscitate 33-day-old Isabellina .

"Two British medical students were stabbed to death in Malaysia yesterday following an argument in a bar. Neil Dalton and Aidan Brunger, both 22, were reportedly knifed by a mob of local men who were high on drugs and had accused the Britons of being too noisy. The fourth-year Newcastle University students had been due to fly home tomorrow following a six-week placement caring for patients at a hospital in Kuching on the island of Borneo. Scroll down for video . Killed: Fourth-year students Aidan Brunger (left, outside the Kuching hospital where he was working) and Neil Dalton (right), both 22, have been killed  while on the Malaysian part of Borneo island . Death: The two students were on a six week placement in Malaysia along with five other medical students at the time of the attack. Pictured is Neil Dalton . Malaysian police said they were pounced on in the street after being tailed by a car as they walked home following the bar row. Last night, as tributes poured in for . the ‘highly committed’ aspiring doctors, officers said they had arrested . three suspects who could now face the death penalty. A fourth was still . at large. The devastated families of Mr Brunger and Mr Dalton were informed of their deaths yesterday. They had been staying at the . £4-a-night Singgahsana backpacker hostel and putting their medical . studies into practice during the summer secondment to Sarawak General . Hospital. Taken away: One of the four suspects is arrested by police following the killing of the students in Malaysia . Arrested: Police in Sarawak have said four suspects are in custody following the attack in the early hours . The attack happened at 4.15am local . time following a row in a city centre bar over the students being too . noisy, said Sarawak deputy police commissioner Chai Khin Chung. The tropical island paradise of Borneo is the third largest island in the world, and the largest in Asia. Control is divided between Malaysia and Brunei in the north and Indonesia in the south. Surrounded by the South China Sea, . its varied scenery including mountains, beaches and rainforest make it a . prime spot for diving, trekking and encounters with endangered . wildlife. Cheap and direct flights from all . over central Asia have put it firmly on the tourist trail, and around . 450,000 Britons visit each year. In 2012, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the island during the Jubilee tour. Kuching is the third largest city, . with a population of about 600,000. It is located in the Malaysian . controlled province of Sarawak. British tourists have been warned . by the Foreign Office to avoid travel to certain parts of Borneo, . following clashes between militants and Malaysian armed forces in the . Sabah region. But outside this, crime levels on the island are low. ‘The four suspects came in [to the . bar] and sat nearby,’ he told a press conference. ‘The two foreigners . were quarrelling amongst themselves, and very noisy. ‘So these four are sitting nearby and . then they told the two gentlemen not to be so noisy, and then the fight . started. After that the two foreigners left the pub, the four followed . from behind with a car.’ One of the men, a 23-year-old . fishmonger, then got out and began stabbing the victims in the chest and . back, Malaysian media reported. He and his accomplices fled, leaving the students lying in the street. Police were called by a restaurant . owner who witnessed the attack. Officers raided the homes of three . suspects, seizing a car and a knife less than two hours later. The suspects, aged 19, 23 and 29, all . reportedly tested positive for drugs. They have been remanded in custody . for seven days. A police spokesman described the case as ‘solved’. Before attending university, . high-flying Mr Dalton achieved four A* grades at A-Level in maths, . chemistry, physics and general studies, at Belper School in Derbyshire. He was also a keen cricketer and had . played for Belper Amateurs for several years. Family friend Sue Bartley, . 50, said: ‘He was very self-motivated and you would often see him . running and cycling. Map: The students were reportedly confronted by a group of men in Abell Road in the city of Kuching . Picture: Police have said the Britons had been due to finish their training at the local hospital on Friday and the four suspects are in custody . Investigation: Reports from the island claim the Britons were attacked and killed in the street by a gang of four local men after a row in a bar in Kuching . ‘He really was the brightest, the . best, the most intelligent and self-motivated. He had always said that . he wanted to be a doctor, and he studied very hard. He was a true . gentleman.’ The murdered medical students went to Borneo to spend their summer holiday treating hospital patients. They were among a group of seven young medics from Newcastle University keen to put their studies into practice. Their trip, which it is likely they would have had to fund at least partially themselves, came after four years of learning medical theory in lectures and tutorials. It was a golden opportunity to get hands-on practice while also helping to treat people in a developing country. Professor Jane Calvert, Dean of Undergraduate Studies for Newcastle University Medical School, said of Neil Dalton and Aidan Brunger: ‘They were doing what thousands of medical students do every year, they were on an elective to experience clinical practice in a different setting, to learn from that and enhance their practice when they came back. ‘I didn’t know them personally but they were well-known by the programme director and teachers on the course and we are all so shocked and saddened by this. ‘For all our students going on elective, all the risks are looked at and we’re very careful not to let them go to places that are known to be of high risk. Where they were working is a very nice place – I was there myself earlier in the year and I was especially shocked to hear it had happened there.’ Students doing work experience at a hospital in a developing country are often given more responsibility than they would expect to get in the UK. Organisations involved in arranging similar medical work placements for students say it is a challenging but greatly rewarding experience. One such company tells students looking to apply: ‘Working in a hospital overseas is a great experience, not only because of the close up clinical experience you will receive. ‘It is also a great way to learn about healthcare in other countries and to observe the ethical dilemmas doctors face day-to-day in less well-funded hospitals around the globe. ‘The cases you will observe will also differ from what you would generally see at home. Typhoid, dengue fever, tuberculosis and malaria are all a good contrast to what you might find in your local hospital.’ After a placement, students are usually free to travel around and explore whichever country they are in. The family of Mr Dalton, whose father is thought to be a teacher, were too upset to speak yesterday. His former headmaster at Belper School, Martyn Cooper, said: ‘Neil was always a fully engaged and promising student. ‘Our memories of him are of a vibrant and interested young man, who enjoyed his studies and made contributions to many events. ‘He was a particularly-able mathematician, winning several awards during his school years.’ Mr Brunger lived with his mother and . stepfather who runs a local car dealership in Gillingham, Kent. Neighbours said the news has ‘shocked the entire street’. One, who did not want to be . identified, said: ‘He was such a lovely little boy, just about to start . his life in such a meaningful way.’ Professor Jane Calvert, of Newcastle . University Medical School, said: ‘They were excellent students. They . were doing really well with their studies. ‘They were highly committed and coming . back next year to work as doctors. Aidan was aspiring to do some . medical research on his return, Neil was going straight in to his final . year. It’s such a tragic thing to occur.’ A third British medical student, Niall Durkan, 23, was with the group in Sarawak but not present when the attack happened. A relative said the student called . home ‘in a bit of a state’ in the early hours. She added: ‘Niall called . his mother and told her that he wasn’t with the two boys at the time. ‘Apparently Niall and some of the . others left the two victims in a club or somewhere, and from there they . went on to this bar where the attack broke out. ‘The first Niall knew about it was . when the police knocked on his door. They were looking for an iPad, . presumably belonging to one of the victims. ‘He asked why they wanted it and they just told him it was in connection with their murder investigation. ‘Niall had been having a great time out there before this happened. I think they were finishing at the hospital this week.’ The Foreign Office said it was aware of the deaths and providing consular assistance to the students’ families. In May British accountant Gareth Huntley disappeared from his lodgings on Tioman Island, off the Malaysian peninsula. The 34-year-old, who was working as a . volunteer on a turtle conservation project, vanished after setting out . to walk a jungle trail. It took more than a week for the authorities to find his body. His throat had been cut. Police probe: Officers pictured arresting one of the four suspects at their home in Kuching, Malaysia .

"Botched: Labour have criticsed the appointment of Lord Hill of Oareford as Britain's next EU commissoner . David Cameron’s bid to secure a top job for Britain in the EU Commission was branded a ‘shambles’ last night after his controversial candidate was forced to sell his shares in a major lobbying company. Downing Street said Lord Hill of Oareford would sell what is thought to be a major shareholding in the lobbying giant Huntsworth amid warnings in Brussels that it would make his candidacy unacceptable. Labour said the move underlined the botched nature of Lord Hill’s appointment. Shadow Europe Minister Gareth Thomas said: ‘David Cameron’s approach to Europe goes from bad to worse. After his complete failure to stop Jean-Claude Juncker becoming Commission President this shambles will not help in rebuilding our influence to secure crucial reforms.’ He said Lord Hill should now face confirmation hearings at Westminster as well as in the European Parliament. Lord Hill, who was Mr Cameron’s surprise choice to be Britain’s next EU commissioner, has spent his entire career in the revolving door between lobbying and politics. He and his PR companies have spun for a string of foreign regimes, banks and big businesses, many of them with direct interests in Brussels. Big name clients included the United Arab Emirates, Tesco and shamed welfare-to-work firm A4e. Phillipe Lamberts, the leader of the Green group of MEPs, raised concerns about Lord Hill’s past as a lobbyist and his links to Huntsworth, which is owned by Mr Cameron’s Oxfordshire neighbour and constituency chairman Lord Chadlington. He said allowing Lord Hill’s appointment would be like ‘letting the wolves into the sheep fold’ – and suggested that the European Parliament could use its powers to block him. Several senior Brussels figures were also said to have raised concerns with Europe Minister David Lidington in the 24 hours since Lord Hill’s nomination for the £210,000-a-year job was announced. Downing Street insisted there was no conflict of interest, but said Lord Hill wanted to make sure his confirmation hearings at the European Parliament were ‘as smooth as possible’ with ‘no perceived conflict of interest’. Mr Lamberts said: ‘There is no shame in having worked for the private sector. The question is conflicts of interest. If it comes to a hearing, someone with a past in lobbying can expect to be grilled with double the energy. We want to reduce the influence of lobbying and we don’t want to let the wolves into the sheep fold.’ The President of the European Parliament warned that Lord Hill could also be blocked because of his Eurosceptic views. In an extraordinary snub, German socialist Martin Schulz, who is a key ally of Mr Juncker, said he could not rule out Lord Hill being rejected. ‘I can’t imagine that Hill, with his radical anti-European views, which he is supposed to have, will get a majority in the European Parliament,’ he said. While the parliament cannot vote against individual Commissioners it can reject their suitability as a whole, leading to nominees perceived as weak being rejected. Shambles: Shadow Europe Minister Gareth Thomas (left) said David Cameron’s approach to Europe has gone 'from bad to worse' follwing his failure to  stop Jean-Claude Juncker (right) becoming Commission President . This morning Mr Cameron will hold his first face-to-face talks with Mr Juncker since his failed bid to stop the federalist former prime minister of Luxembourg becoming president of the European Commission. The Prime Minister will seek a top economic job for Lord Hill – either trade, competition or responsibility for the EU’s single market – despite the controversy surrounding his candidacy. But experts warned that his decision to send a low-profile candidate – partly because of a reluctance to spark a by-election – could count against Britain, when other countries are nominating much more senior ministers. Mats Persson, director of the think tank Open Europe, described it as a gamble. Lord Hill was backed by newly-appointed Defence Minister Michael Fallon, who said he was ‘one of the most effective political operators we’ve got’. Mr Fallon acknowledged that the reshuffle had given the Cabinet a more Eurosceptic edge, but said this was in tune with public opinion.","Lord Hill of Oareford will sell a major share of lobbying giant Huntsworth .

"They are both titans at the BBC but are on a collision course over one’s treatment of the English language. On air yesterday, John Humphrys chastised fellow Radio 4 grandee Lord Bragg for speaking about historic events in the present tense. The Today presenter, famed for his tough questioning, declared it was ‘confusing, bogus, irritating and pretentious’. War of words: John Humphrys has thrown down the gauntlet to fellow broadcaster Melvyn Bragg over his use of English . He threw down the gauntlet to Lord Bragg, 74, over his weekly history show In Our Time, insisting: ‘This is important, this is a battle…the war is going to be about stuff like this.’ Both broadcasting veterans pride themselves on being sticklers for accuracy and both have written books on the English language. Humphrys said Lord Bragg's use of the present tense was 'faddish, confusing and very BBC' But Humphrys, 70, mocked the peer’s style on Sunday’s Radio 4 show Broadcasting House. In a parody of an introduction to In Our Time, he said: ‘The young Charles Darwin is developing severe doubts about biblical literalism, but he doesn’t want to upset the Church; meanwhile his daughter develops a boil on her bottom (or whatever): how does he feel about this?’ Humphrys was prompted to go public after columnist Matthew Parris raised the issue in The Times last week. He wrote: ‘In English usage, there’s a slide towards employing the present tense to describe the historic past. On In Our Time they do it all the time. ‘I hate the fashion, thought so cutting edge and cool. Academics are doing it all the time, injecting a bogus sense of immediacy into discussion. It’s faddish, confusing and very BBC.’ Humphrys, who also hosts BBC2’s Mastermind, said: ‘Melvyn [Bragg] is a giant, a titan of broadcasting as we all know. I wouldn’t have gone public with it if it hadn’t been for Matthew [Parris]. ‘But it is confusing, I believe. It gives a bogus, an entirely bogus, sense of immediacy. It is irritating, it is pretentious.’ He complained that the habit was pervading news bulletins and other programmes too. But Humphrys admitted: ‘With a bit of luck, Melvyn will be on holidays and he won’t have heard this, because I fear the confrontation.’ Humphrys, who began at the BBC in 1966, has signed a contract to stay there. There was no response from Lord Bragg yesterday.","Humphrys blasted Lord Bragg for talking about history in present tense .

"Big day: Navy officer Richard Gray at his wedding in Cornwall in December . Arm-in-arm with his bride as they walk under a guard of honour, this is the Royal Navy officer who allegedly had an affair with Britain’s first female warship captain. Just a month after his ‘perfect wedding’, Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray sailed into a sex scandal aboard HMS Portland. The 35-year-old, who is third-in-command of the Royal Navy frigate, is accused of having an inappropriate relationship with Commander Sarah West, 42, its trailblazing skipper. As both officers face disciplinary action, photographs have emerged of Lt Cdr Gray’s fairytale white wedding to his bride Melissa, 33. They married by the sea in Cornwall, gave guests hand-knitted crochet lobsters and posed for stunning pictures on the beach. The couple had a guard of honour from HMS Portland as they walked from the pretty 16th century St Enodoc’s Church in Trebetherick. And the proud new Mrs Gray – who broke tradition to propose to her groom – even wrote about their special day for Perfect Wedding magazine. Yet they spent only five weeks of married life together before her husband departed for a seven-month tour of the Atlantic on HMS Portland. Lt Cdr Gray is Portland’s operations officer, in charge of weapons and defence systems, and would have been one of the captain’s closest confidantes. But at his wedding, on December 6, 2013, he only had eyes for his bride. An aircraft engineer from Bristol, she wore Manolo Blahnik designer heels and a midi-length white dress. She revealed in her Perfect Wedding article how she proposed during the leap year 2012 on February 29 – traditionally the one day when women can ask for their boyfriend’s hand in marriage. She wrote: 'I proposed to Ritchie while he was away with the Navy.  As we were going to be apart, I had bought a card and written him a short note, which I hid in his bag. Scroll down for video . Dedicated: Commander Sarah West said earlier this year that work commitments got in the way of her love life . And now the ship’s captain has been flown home in disgrace over claims of an affair with him. Divorced Cdr West could lose command of her vessel or even be sacked, two years after she made history by becoming the first woman in the Navy’s 500-year history to captain a frontline warship.

'On the 29 February I got a phone-call at 6.30am - he had been up since 5am saying yes!' The couple organised a nautical-themed wedding, ‘an obvious choice as we both have a strong connection to the sea’, she said. The bride wrote that the ceremony was ‘incredibly personal, and saying our vows just felt like we were talking to one another’. She added: ‘I don’t think either of us had expected it to be quite so emotional and overwhelming’. Before the wedding, she had shed tears of joy when she collected her silk satin organza bridal gown by designer Gilly Woo. ‘I cried when I picked it up because I couldn't believe it was finished and looked so perfect,’ she said.

"Free man: Archie Reed, 20, pictured at the Old Bailey earlier in his trial, was cleared of sexual assault . A judge has attacked prosecutors over a mismanaged rape case in which a former public schoolboy was accused of assaulting a friend after a night of drinking. Archie Reed, 20, walked free from the Old Bailey yesterday after being cleared of all charges of attacking his ex-classmate in her university halls. It can now be reported that Judge Anthony Morris QC had urged prosecutors to drop the case before the trial had even begun. During the hearing he also criticised the CPS over some of the evidence submitted. Mr Reed, who now works for a currency consultancy after leaving his £30,000-a-year boarding school, had been accused of attempting to rape the law student after a boozy night out. He told the court that a sexual encounter had happened and was ‘definitely consensual’. Mr Reed was cleared of assault by penetration by the unanimous verdict of the jury of five men and seven women. He had earlier been formally cleared of attempted rape on the instruction of Judge Morris, who criticised the CPS. He told prosecutor Dianne Chan: ‘These were people who were good friends of each other, close friends who spent the evening drinking quite a considerable quantity of alcohol together, at the end of which the allegation is the defendant in a drunken state took advantage of her. ‘It is something which he bitterly regretted as soon as it happened and he was stopped in the course of it. ‘Some might say to go through the process now is going to make matters worse rather than better, but that’s a matter for the complainant and the Crown.’ Mr Reed, was accused of pouncing on the 19-year-old woman when they shared a bed after a drunken night out in central London on October 8 last year. The pair had shared two bottles of wine before she had invited him back to her room after he missed the last Tube. CCTV showed the pair holding hands and hugging on their way back to her halls. Mr Reed said he had decided to ‘go for it’ after she had kissed him and invited him into her bed. He said she had pushed herself against his groin. He touched her intimately and when she told him to stop a confused Mr Reed said he left soon afterwards. She claimed he had pulled off her pyjama bottoms and knickers while she slept. A fortnight later Mr Reed, who works at Smart Currency Business, was hauled in by police for questioning. He was charged five months later, but the case against him began to unravel as soon as the two-week trial began. Verdict: Judge Anthony Morris QC said, 'It would be helpful for someone from the CPS to be in court and see the problems created at cases which aren't investigated properly' The jury struggled to follow a video interview with the alleged victim, and it was left to the defence team to produce a transcript. Police experts had been unable to download key texts sent and received by the woman, and had resorted to taking photos of the screens, which were barely legible. Forced into yet another adjournment because evidence was not ready, Judge Morris said: ‘I would never have started this case if I had known it would take this course. That is a shortcoming of the investigation of this matter.’ It then emerged that vital messages sent by the alleged victim hours after the incident had been wiped. Police were forced to admit they had not seized her phone after she first complained, and waited six months before analysing it. Invited home: Mr Reed told the Old Bailey how his accuser invited him home and forced him away after he started performing a sex act on her . When he learned the alleged victim had not been questioned about the missing texts, the judge took a further swipe at the Crown Prosecution Service for pursuing the case. He said: ‘Sometimes it would be helpful for someone from the CPS to be in court and see the problems created at cases which aren’t investigated properly, and the consequences, instead of being at the end of the phone opining whether cases should go ahead or not.’ In spiky exchanges with Miss Chan, the judge asked whether the CPS knew ‘what a mess had been made of the telephone evidence’. Mr Reed’s defence team narrowly failed to have the case against him thrown out, and then brought forward a string of glowing character references. The former head girl at his school described Mr Reed as a ‘gentleman’ who could always be trusted to look after his friends. She said her baby-faced friend, an accomplished musician and singer, had never taken advantage of her and was shy around girls. Trial: The judge of the criminal hearing at the Old Bailey in Central London (pictured) said he would not have started the trial had he known the parlous state of the evidence . Mr Reed, of Kensington, West London, denied attempted rape and assault by penetration. His barrister Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC said she was considering making a wasted costs application in addition to her client’s defence costs because of the way the case was handled. The judge said any costs application would be heard at a later date. The verdict comes after a retired judge warned recently that rape convictions will not improve until women stop drinking heavily. Mary Jane Mowat, 66, told the Oxford Mail of the difficulties of bringing sex assault cases to court when the alleged victim had been drinking. She said: ‘I will also say, and I will be pilloried for saying so, but the rape conviction statistics will not improve until women stop getting so drunk. ‘I’m not saying it’s right to rape a drunken woman, I’m not saying for a moment that it’s allowable to take advantage of a drunken woman. ‘But a jury in a position where they’ve got a woman who says “I was absolutely off my head, I can’t really remember what I was doing, I can’t remember what I said, I can’t remember if I consented or not but I know I wouldn’t have done”. ‘I mean when a jury is faced with something like that, how are they supposed to react?’","Archie Reed, 20, was accused of attacking student in halls of residence .

"Three police officers enjoyed the hospitality laid on by Arsenal star Mesut Ozil less than 24 hours after the midfielder was subject to an investigation by their force. Ozil, who is due to play for Germany in Sunday’s World Cup final, became a police suspect following an alleged assault. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mesut Ozil on Arsenal FA Cup victory parade . The freebie: Detective Sergeant Simon Jones (left) and Mesut Ozil (second left) in the player’s box at the Emirates with a youth, an unidentified fan and Detective Constable Helen Nicolson (far right), who was not involved in the investigation . Applause: Detective Constable Dean Sliney with Ozil . Two of the officers in the box had been sent to take a statement from Ozil.. They accepted an invitation to a Premier League match against Sunderland on February 22 in North London the following afternoon – and the third detective came along too. On Friday, after the Mail showed its evidence to Scotland Yard, the Met began an inquiry and said the officers would be questioned under criminal caution. Freelance photographer Lee Essex dialled 999 on February 21 claiming Ozil had driven his Porsche into him, knocking his arm with a wing mirror. Police and an ambulance attended the scene, near the footballer’s North London mansion. The next day, two of the detectives investigating the case – said to be ‘avid Arsenal fans’ – and a female colleague were treated to seats in Ozil’s private box at the Emirates. Police later announced that after ‘careful consideration’ no action would be taken. Ozil, who starred in Germany’s extraordinary 7-1 drubbing of Brazil in Tuesday’s Word Cup semi-final, was not playing in the match because of an injury, so was in his box with the officers to watch his team beat the Black Cats 4-1. Detective Sergeant Simon Jones and Detective Constable Dean Sliney were joined by Detective Constable Helen Nicolson, who was photographed grinning as she shook hands with Ozil. Officers accepting hospitality from a suspect raises serious questions for the Met. Mr Essex, 60, claims Ozil drove at him as he was on the pavement trying to take photographs of the German near his six-bedroom £7million mansion. He says the car’s wing mirror hit his arm. Ozil disputes this. His spokesman claims the photographer chased and hit Ozil’s car. The detectives were called in to trace Ozil and are understood to have taken a statement from him. On March 28, Mr Essex received a letter from the Met saying no further action would be taken. Met chiefs are said to be ‘fuming’ over the revelations involving the officers. A source said: ‘This is stupidity rather than corruption. Their very appearance at this match while an investigation is ongoing will draw the Met into disrepute. Out of here: Helen Nicolson was photographed grinning as she shook hands with Ozil . Probe: Football superstar Ozil on the night of the incident.

'It’s their naivety and stupidity that is the problem and the Met is taking this extremely seriously. It doesn’t look good.’ Scotland Yard said the officers had been investigated following a complaint from a colleague in February.

"Human remains are still lying around the MH17 crash site nine days after the tragedy and are exposed to the 'ravages of the European summer and animals,' Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said. Addressing media on Saturday, Mr Abbott - referring to information he had received from Australian teams who have arrived in Ukraine - said the presence of 'unrecovered remains' at the site highlights the urgent need for an international force to secure the area. Local villagers are some of the people seen rifling through the wreckage, which stretches across kilometres of farming villages. Australia has sent 230-strong team, comprising 190 federal police and defence personnel - including medical specialists, to Europe but they have had to remain in Kiev until permission is given for them to enter eastern Ukraine to assist with the recovery operation. The nation's officials had gained access to the site on Friday, but Mr Abbott added: 'Plainly, there are unrecovered bodies remaining in the area.' 'It's the presence of unrecovered remains that makes it more important than ever that an international team be dispatched to the site to recover remains, to assist investigations and to obtain justice...for the victims and their loved ones. 'Every day the site remains unsecured, there is more interference and the remains are subject to the ravages of the European summer, animals, disturbance, etc.' Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott says unrecovered bodies of MH17 victims are exposed to 'ravages of the European summer and animals' Picking through the wreckage: A family of Ukrainians walk through the MH17 crash site which is still littered with victims' bodies, belongings and wreckage . Plundered: A child’s belongings spill out of an opened suitcase. It is one of many to have been rifled through at the crash site since the plane came down on July 17 . Permission from Ukraine's parliament for armed Australian personnel to enter the site should be secured next week. Mr Abbott said it was not unusual for armed representatives to be involved. 'When you've got a major humanitarian effort as we have, it's normal and natural to have [Australian Defence Force] assistance,' he said. The presence of armed personnel should not compound the MH17 tragedy but the recovery and investigation effort needed to move swiftly and those involved should not be in danger, Mr Abbott said. 'We do want to get this done as quickly as we humanly can and that's why we're exploring all options.' Special envoy air chief marshal Angus Houston said the armed personnel would be protecting the experts at the crash site, and were working with the Ukrainian parliament to ratify the arrangement. 'We welcome Acting Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman’s comments on 25 July that he hopes the Verhovna Rada [Parliament of Ukraine] can adopt the arrangement next week,' he said. 'The president, government and parliament of Ukraine are working together to get the arrangement ratified. 'Australia understands that this is a politically challenging time for Ukraine, and we greatly appreciate the assistance and cooperation received from President Poroshenko, Acting Prime Minister Groysman, Foreign Minister Klimkin, and other Ukrainian officials.'

Painstaking: Malaysian experts check debris at the main crash site of the Boeing 777 Malaysia Airlines flight which came down in a remote war-torn corner of Ukraine . Assessment: Forensic . experts have spent days at the crash site, near . the village of Grabovo, to carry out investigations and attempt to locate the plane's black boxes . An Australian squadron leader who is one of the pilots flying remains of victims to the Netherlands on a C-17 aircraft told the ABC that it was a 'big' and 'very sad task'. Royal Australian Air Force squadron leader Dean Bolton told the national broadcaster that flying from Eindhoven Air base to the Ukraine took three hours. Then cargo and human remains were loaded up and the aircraft returned to Eindhoven, where a 'ramp ceremony' - respectfully removing the remains from the aircraft in coffins - was conducted. 'It's a big task. It's a very sad task. But all the folks deployed over here take great pride in taking part in it and just being able to help out with getting the people back to their families.' Squadron leader Bolton said the most challenging moment had probably been meeting the families after a ceremony at Eindhoven. 'That's been certainly quite a touching moment,' he said. 'They are thankful for what we are doing here. 'They're obviously going through untold grief but their only real response has been thankful that we're here.' Tragic: A toy teddy bear placed at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, near the village of Hrabove, eastern Ukraine, shows a mark of respect to the victims . Wreckage: The Malaysia Airlines flight was carrying 298 passengers when it came down over eastern Ukraine on July 17 . Tragic: One resident surveys the damage of MH17 which was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it came down over eastern Ukraine, killing all on board . It has been nine days since the Malaysia Airlines jet was shot down over a remote war-torn corner of eastern Ukraine. But as world leaders prevaricate over their response to an act of mass murder, the disgraceful failure to recover all 298 victims of flight MH17 was all too evident yesterday. Three generations of one Ukrainian family could be seen picking their way through the wreckage like people inspecting the aftermath of a storm. Many bodies are still lost in the fields of sunflowers that surround the area – and could remain until the 1.5m high crops are harvested next month. But it is the inescapable stench of rotting flesh in 30C heat that is so distressing – at a site controlled by the same heavily armed pro-Russian rebels accused of destroying the Boeing 777 with a missile. It can only be guessed what the families of those who lost their lives on the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur must make of it all. Although the repatriation flights have begun, just 200 bodies and an unspecified number of body parts have so far been sent to the Netherlands for identification. Almost a third of the 298 killed – who included ten Britons – could still be missing and may never be found. The band of inexperienced Kalashnikov-wielding recruits in charge in this corner of Ukraine has refused access to international forensic experts. As a result, the crash scene – which stretches for kilometres across the farming villages of Rassypnoe, Grabovo and Petropavloka – remains in a state of ugly chaos. Persistent looting means vital evidence – and sentimental keepsakes – have been lost. Parts of the plane have been stolen to be sold as scrap. Giant pieces of fuselage are strewn for miles, along with twisted burnt metal, suitcases and clothing. Parts of the doomed jet’s cockpit lie surrounded by personal possessions that have clearly been tampered with or stolen from. Wallets – emptied of cash – lie next to children’s shoes and toys. A baby’s bottle rests by a pile of opened letters. Nearby, a collection of classical music is scattered across the charred ground. Also still visible are the remains of animals and birds from the jet’s hold, including pigeons, two dogs, peacocks and parrots. Respect: Funeral hearses carrying the first 40 victims of MH17 arrived at the Korporaal van Oudheusden Kazerne barracks in Hilversum, The Netherlands on Thursday . Tributes: Hundreds of flowers and tributes were laid n Eindhoven, Netherlands, as several of the bodies of the MH17 victims were transported back to the country . Some locals have begun to light candles around the debris and to lay teddy bears in memory of the 80 children who died. Retired miner Alexander Benayka, 57, who lives yards from the crashed cockpit, said many bodies are still hidden in the sunflowers as temperatures soar. The father of two, one of 200 volunteers told by the rebels to search for bodies, said: ‘You can smell them everywhere. It is too hot. There are also wild dogs here. The bodies will not last much longer. We need international forces to help search the site properly before it is too late. ‘The bodies are in the fields but you cannot see them for the sunflowers. We do not harvest until the end of August so unless someone comes to help, they will not be uncovered until then.’ Tears streaming down his face, Mr Benayka added: ‘I saw many dead children here by my house. I bring flowers and light candles as respect for them.’ Grieving relatives have told of how credit cards and mobile phones belonging to victims have been used since the crash. The Foreign Office yesterday said it will work with relatives to help protect against fraud. The crash investigation is being led by a Dutch team as 194 of those killed were from the Netherlands. Yesterday, a small group was able to visit part of the scene, while a group of 40 Dutch policemen are reported to be on their way to try to help secure the area. Some 90 Australian military police are on standby in London. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott fears some remains will never be recovered unless security is tightened. US Ambassador to the Ukraine Jeffrey Pyatt said the crash site is ‘a giant crime scene and needs to be treated that way.’ ‘Further destruction of the wreckage must be stopped. It’s tragic that the site has still not fully been secured,’ he added.","Australia has sent 230 experts - including 190 federal police and defence personnel - over to the Ukrainian crash site .

"Emilie Gregg, pictured, claimed she had been demoted from her trader job at a Mayfair wealth management company after returning from maternity leave . A trader at a £4billion Mayfair wealth management company claims her boss greeted news she was pregnant by saying: ‘I knew something like this was going to happen.’ Emilie Gregg told a tribunal she was ‘bullied, harassed, victimised and blatantly discriminated against’ for taking maternity leave from her £150,000-a-year job. The 33-year-old trader, who worked at Troy Asset Management, also claims she was demoted after the baby was born. ‘When I told my boss Sebastian Lyon I was pregnant, his response was, “I knew something like this would happen”. I felt as though I had done something wrong,’ she told an employment tribunal. ‘I was told he did not like my attitude and I was pretty ungrateful.’ She claimed the company sexually discriminated against her by failing to give her details of a maternity policy until three months after she announced  her pregnancy. Troy Asset Management, which handles a £4billion portfolio, denies her allegations. It accuses her of exaggerating the facts and ‘telling untruths’. Mrs Gregg, who lives with husband Simon, a luxury car dealer, in a £3.5million mews house in Chelsea, said she started working for the firm as a PA in May 2009. She became portfolio administrator and then rose to head of dealing, earning £65,000 plus a £85,000 bonus. She announced her pregnancy in October 2011 and went on maternity leave in March 2012. She claimed that during her leave she was demoted to portfolio administrator during a reorganisation. In October 2012 she went to see her bosses to say she would be returning to work after a full year, in April 2013.  ‘I thought they would be pleased to know I intended to return, but I was met with stunned silence,’ said Mrs Gregg. ‘I was told during the meeting, “Things have changed greatly since you left”.’ The firm had restructured its business to create a role called head of execution – taking over some of Mrs Gregg’s responsibilities – which was given to an outside candidate, the tribunal heard. Mrs Gregg said she found out the details of the reorganisation only five days before she was due to return to work. ‘I thought the unpleasantness from my maternity leave had been left behind. I was wrong,’ she said. ‘I was frankly devastated. ‘All I wanted was to be treated fairly and be allowed to return to the role I had worked so hard to hold.’ Daniel Stilitz QC, representing Troy at the hearing in central London, said the title ‘head of dealing’ was one Mrs Gregg had given herself and the company, ‘perhaps unwisely’, did not bother to change it. He claimed her evidence was littered with factual errors and inconsistencies. ‘There was no suggestion Mrs Gregg was being forced out, that was a misunderstanding,’ he said. ‘The firm wanted her to return to her role at the end of her leave.’ The hearing continues.","Emilie Gregg claims she was demoted after returning from maternity leave .

"The father of murdered backpacker David Miller has said his son died a hero, trying to help fellow victim Hannah Witheridge. Ian Miller said last night that his ‘wonderful boy’ was probably killed attempting to save the 23-year-old. ‘It has become clearer and clearer that it is quite likely David was stepping in to help a girl who was in trouble,’ the 57-year-old, from St Helier in Jersey, said. ‘That would be absolutely in his character.’ Scroll down for video . Ian Miller said his ‘wonderful boy’ was probably killed attempting to save fellow victim Hannah Witheridge . He spoke as it emerged Miss Witheridge may have been raped by two local men before she was killed on Koh Tao island. But Thai police said they ‘still believe sexual jealousy is at the heart of this crime’. Colonel Kissana Phathanachareon cited ‘fresh evidence which could lead to a new suspect who may have had a relationship or one-night stand with Hannah or one of her friends or David’. The Bangkok Post last night reported police had narrowed their inquiry to two suspects – a Thai national and a Burmese worker. Father Ian Miller said it would be 'absolutely in his character' to try and save a girl who was in trouble . The bodies of students David Miller and Hannah Witheridge were found last Monday on Sairee Beach, Thailand . Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars . David Miller was seen walking past the same spot at a different time with two friends. He is wearing a blue and grey t-shirt and grey shorts . Police are hunting this man filmed running frantically away from the beach on the night of the murders . The bodies of the students, who were staying in the same apartment complex, were found last Monday on Sairee Beach. Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, was bludgeoned with a hoe found nearby while Mr Miller, 24, was battered with an unknown ‘metal weapon’. DNA from Miss Witheridge’s body came from two Asian men – but did not match any of 12 suspects. It is claimed she may have spoken with her attackers before being dragged to her death, with Mr Miller killed after coming to her aid. Officers said it appeared one killer had left his blue shorts at the scene, putting on Mr Miller’s ‘better quality’ beige pair. Last night James Isaacs, a tourist, claimed two British women were recently mugged by a Thai motorbike gang at the spot where the bodies were found. Mr Miller, a businessman, said the family has not been kept informed by Thai police. He added: ‘We have had very little information here about how they are getting on there. We know they are busy but we haven’t got any inside track.’ What can the DNA tell us? DNA found on Miss Witheridge’s body is thought to be from two Asian men. One of the men’s DNA was found on a cigarette butt. What about CCTV? Mr Miller and Chris Ware were filmed leaving a bar at 12.55am. Mr Ware told police they returned to Ocean View guesthouse. Mr Miller went out again at 1am to buy cigarettes, he said. Another friend said Mr Miller ended up in AC nightclub with Miss Witheridge and a friend. What happened next? CCTV shows Mr Miller walking towards Ocean View alone. There is no more footage of Miss Witheridge. She may have walked on the beach and met her killers. Police do not know if she saw Mr Miller or if he heard her scream. What were the weapons? The killers appear to have found a garden hoe and a metal bar lying near the beach. The metal bar has not yet been located by police. What mistakes have Thai police made? The island was not locked down quickly after the bodies were found. Crime scene was not taped off, and full statements not taken from friends. Many conflicting statements by police. Chances of finding killers shrinking rapidly.","The father of murdered backpacker David Miller has said his son died a hero .

"They could call it Harry Potter and the Mystery of the American Housekeeper. The Home Office is probing whether actress Emma Watson’s maid has been working illegally at the star’s £2m north London home. Officials are looking into claims that the housekeeper only had a tourist visa, which would bar her as a foreigner from working here. Scroll down for video . Emma Watson: The Home Office is probing whether actress Watson's maid has been working illegally at the star's £2m north London home . The woman was stopped by UK immigration staff who questioned how she could pay for her stay here, it was claimed. Employers who breach the rules by hiring foreign staff illegally can face a fine of up to £10,000. Watson, 24, who played Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, first started using the maid’s services in her New York apartment last year. But the woman allegedly made trips to London and was paid to help out at the star’s three-storey Georgian terraced house in Islington, it was claimed. Emma Watson appeared in all the Harry Potter films from the age of nine . Between September last year and February this year, she is said to have spent a total of three months in the UK. It was on one of her trips to London that UK Border Agency staff allegedly questioned her about her ability to pay for her stay. A source at the Home Office said: ‘An allegation has been received and processed and has been allocated for further action.’ Watson, worth £30million, has been living in the States where she recently obtained an English literature degree from Brown University in Rhode Island. But she is currently believed to be in London to attend David Cameron’s ‘Cool Britannia’ party in Downing Street tonight. Labour's Baroness Scotland (left) was fined £5,000 for failing to keep proper records about her Tongan housekeeper and Tory Mark Harper (right) had to resign after it became known that his Colombian cleaner was in the United Kingdom illegally . Mr Cameron’s former immigration minister Mark Harper resigned earlier this year when it emerged his Colombian cleaner was in the country unlawfully. Records showed the cleaner received at least £2,000 from Mr Harper’s Westminster expenses before second home allowances were tightened up. And in 2009, it emerged how Labour’s Attorney General Baroness Scotland had employed her Tongan housekeeper in breach of the rules – which her own department had drawn up. Baroness Scotland was fined £5,000 because she had failed to keep copies of her housekeeper’s papers. Employers can avoid being prosecuted or fined a civil penalty if they can show they did everything possible to check the immigration status of a worker. Watson, who starred in all the Harry Potter films from the age of nine, graduated last month from elite Brown University. Watson, who is dating rugby-playing Oxford student Matthew Janney (with ball), has often sought to play down her celebrity status . She made headlines after it emerged the ‘friend’ who accompanied her at the ceremony was actually an armed guard, carrying a gun beneath her gown. The high-security was a marked contrast with her stated aim of having a ‘normal’ experience as a student at the prestigious US college. Watson, who is dating rugby-playing Oxford student Matthew Janney, has often sought to play down her celebrity status. Last night the Home Office declined to say anything, and Watson’s spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.","Maid has already worked last year at Watson's New York home .

"In life, his courage and selflessness inspired the nation. Now, one month after his death, teenage cancer victim Stephen Sutton has been honoured with a rare posthumous MBE. The 19-year-old formally accepted the tribute before losing his fight with the illness – and declared the honour ‘awesome’. Scroll down for video . Award: Stephen Sutton, who lost his battle with cancer one month ago, knew about his accolade before he died. He said the honour was 'awesome' Stephen, whose trademark thumbs-up gesture summed up his refusal to be cowed by the disease, captured hearts and raised an astonishing £4million for the Teenage Cancer Trust. His mother Jane, 49, of Lichfield, Staffordshire, said she was ‘truly delighted and immensely proud’ he had been recognised. Announcing the birthday honours yesterday, the Cabinet Office said more than 1,100 people had received an award, 49 per cent of them women. Some 11 per cent of the honours are for work in education – including knighthoods or damehoods for five heads – while health workers make up 8 per cent. Those who helped in the aftermath of the floods that hit the South-West in February are recognised too. Robert Francis, QC, who led the inquiry into scandal-hit Stafford Hospital after up to 1,200 patients died unnecessarily, is knighted for services to healthcare and patients. 'Proud': Stephen's mother Jane, 49, said she was 'truly delighted' her son - who raised an astonishing £4milion for the Teenage Cancer Trust - was given the honour . Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, gets an OBE for services to consumer rights and charitable services, and pensions expert Ros Altmann – who led a crusade for pensioners losing their final salary schemes – receives a CBE. In politics, Labour MP Dawn Primarolo, the Deputy Speaker – once known as Red Dawn for her Left-wing views – receives a damehood. Knighthoods go to veteran Eurosceptic MP Bill Cash, 74; fellow Tory Nicholas Soames, grandson of Sir Winston Churchill; and Tony Blair’s biographer Anthony Seldon, the head of Wellington College. A CBE goes to former Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Elizabeth Filkin. A scientist targeted by animal rights activists receives a knighthood after previously being snubbed. Neuroscientist Professor Colin Blakemore, 70, has endured letters laced with razor blades, parcel bombs and kidnap threats to his children.","Teenage cancer victim Stephen Sutton honoured with posthumous MBE .

"A Briton who was killed by a great white shark yesterday had joked about the danger just 24 hours earlier, his family said last night. Paul Wilcox swam in the sea near his property in Byron Bay every day but had never mentioned sharks until his final call home, his anguished parents told the Mail.

He . said: ‘Then I . realised he was in trouble and I had to make a decision - and that . decision was to try to do what I could to help him. ‘I didn’t think much about the shark – I just needed to help the . man.

"A British pensioner has been trampled to death by a wild elephant at a jungle waterhole in India. Retired geography teacher Colin Manvell, 67, went off alone on foot to take photographs of a kingfisher – and never returned. According to a forest warden, the keen birdwatcher was attacked by a bull elephant which knocked him to the ground with its trunk, then stomped on him. Keen photographer Colin Manvell, 68, (left) was taking pictures of the animals in a southern Indian reserve when he was trampled to death by an elephant . The retired teacher, 68, suffered serious injuries and died before he reached medical attention from a doctor . Photographer: Mr Manvell was a bird enthusiast and keen photographer who loved to travel . He was found badly injured as the elephant trumpeted nearby. With no doctor present at the local hospital, he died soon after. A friend in England said last night that the skilled photographer was hard of hearing, so may not have heard the animal approaching. Police in India were checking how the tragedy happened, with some reports suggesting Mr Manvell should not have been in the spot where he died. The pensioner, of Havant in Hampshire, had become a regular visitor to India in recent years, and produced impressive photographs of wildlife, including images of elephants at play, and close-ups of birds and butterflies. His latest trip to the sub-continent began just over a week ago. He was so used to going to the country that when he found all hotels booked up he was able to stay with a friend instead, and with the help of a forest guide – named only as M Kumar – planned a visit to the Masinagudi zone of the Mudumalai National Park in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. The park contains extensive forest and includes a protected tiger reserve. It also has a number of areas where guides are not supposed to take their clients. Wild: Elephants roam wild in Masinagudi National Park, where reports say tourists tried to warn the man before he was trampled . Treks: Tourists can go on treks in Masinagudi National Park, pictured, to see the diverse wildlife in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu . Guide Mr Kumar said yesterday: ‘After lunch on Thursday, sir (Mr Manvell) went out on foot for bird watching near a lake which is a watering hole of wild elephants. ‘When he did not return by 4.15pm, we followed his trail and heard the sounds of a tusker (elephant) trumpeting loudly.’ A forest warden who goes by one name, Gnanadoss, supported the suggestions that Mr Manvell did not notice the adult male elephant until it was too late. He said: ‘It swiped him with its trunk and then trampled him on the ground.’ The forest warden added that the tragedy occurred 100 yards from a site where a woman was killed by elephants in 2009. The retired geography teacher loved to travel and was a keen photographer . He had been visiting a tour guide in India whom he travelled with twice a year when the fatal elephant attack happened . Generous: Mr Manvell's brother described his sibling as 'generous;' saying he would make curries for the whole of his tennis club team when they had matches . Mr Manvell's brother Derek, said without a doubt, Colin's biggest love was tennis and he had been involved in his local tennis club for years . Mr Manvell was taken from the scene bleeding from his injuries but there were no doctors at the local hospital to treat him. He was driven to a medical centre in Cuddalore, more than 14 miles away, but died on the way. Mr Kumar added: ‘He knew his way all around here. He was aware of the wild elephants and also the other dangers that lurk in the jungles. This is tragic.’ Last night Mr Manvell’s brother Derek, 74, said: ‘In the last five years safaris have become his passion. He has been out there twice a year. ‘His guide and friend found him on the ground. He died doing something he loved.’ Mr Manvell’s nephew Roger Manvell, 47, said: ‘Our main focus is trying to get the body back home.’ Divorcee Mr Manvell had been head of geography at Warblington School in Havant. The man was trampled to death by the elephant in Masinagudi National Park, shown in red, south west of Bangalore .","Colin Manvell, 68, from Havant, Hampshire, died at the Masinagudi National Park, in the state of Tamil Nadu, India .

"Britain has asked Indonesia not to press for the death penalty in the case of an ex-PCSO accused of trafficking crystal meth just days after the start of her trial. Andrea Ruth Waldeck was hooded as she was brought into court to face charges of possessing £12,000 worth of crystal methamphetamine, from which the drug Ice is made. She is alleged to have passed through the city airport after a flight from China with 1.4 kilograms of drugs hidden in her underwear and strapped to her body. Scroll down for video .

Andrea Waldeck, 43, was arrested by detectives . who said they searched her hotel room and found crystal methamphetamine worth . £3,000 taped to her stomach . Police allege they found the drugs when they raided her hotel room. In a letter to Miss Waldeck's lawyer, which has also been passed to prosecutors, the embassy asked for leniency. 'We have received an official letter from the British Embassy in Jakarta requesting prosecutors reconsider the death penalty request for Andrea. Further, in order to strengthen the argument, the embassy will send an official to testify in Andrea’s favour,' her lawyer Mr Oktavianto Prasongko told The Jakarta Post. Waldeck was hooded and guided into the courtroom. She is accused is smuggling crystal meth into Indonesia . He said the embassy would present the facts regarding Miss Waldeck's role as a community police officer and social worker who dealt with drug addicts while serving in the UK. 'Most important is the fact she has never been involved with any crime while serving and living in her country,' said Mr Oktavianto. Prosecutor Mr Deddy Agus Oktavianto has already asked the court for a mandatory death sentence for the British woman, . Police are still hunting for an Indonesian man and Miss Waldeck's Nigerian boyfriend, identified only as Joe. She told authorities that she was ordered to deliver 3lb (1.47kg) of the highly addictive drug, known as crystal meth, by her boyfriend. She was arrested in April after tip off to police.

If convicted, she will become the second British woman facing the firing squad in Indonesia for drug-smuggling. Grandmother Lindsay Sandiford was sentenced to death in January after cocaine worth an estimated £1.6millon was found in the lining of her suitcase. Waldeck was declared bankrupt in 2009 with debts of more than £120,000. Prosecutors say she initially evaded customs officials at Juanda Airport while hiding four packets of drugs in her underwear.

"British detectives have interviewed a second woman in Australia in connection with sex abuse claims against Rolf Harris. She claims the entertainer sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager living in the UK. The woman, who now lives in Wollongong, near Sydney, was quizzed by officers from Operation Yewtree, set up last year to investigate the Jimmy Savile sex scandal. Investigation: Detectives from Scotland Yard a second Australian woman after interviewing Lauren Martell (left) in connection with sex abuse allegations levelled against entertainer Rolf Harris (right, with his wife Alwen) Earlier this month another woman, . Lauren Martell, was interviewed at her home in Wiseman’s Ferry, north of . Sydney, by Scotland Yard officers. The 43-year-old mother of two says . she is a witness to an alleged ‘incident’, rather than a victim. Harris, 83, was arrested in March and . has been interviewed twice in Britain. No charges have been brought and . he has strenuously denied any wrongdoing. He was arrested after a woman told . police she was sexually assaulted by him when she was a teenager. Harris, a favourite of the Queen, is the biggest name to be arrested so . far by Yewtree officers. Lauren Martell, pictured emerging from her home, told police of an alleged 'incident' involving Mr Harris at a London recording studio more than 20 years ago . Inquiry: Mrs Martell said later that the detectives had told her they were interviewing other people in Australia . The artist, singer and children’s . entertainer was first interviewed under caution over alleged sexual . offences on November 29 after attending a police station by appointment. Five days earlier, officers searched . his home in Bray, Berkshire, while he was out of the country and took . away computer equipment and other items. On March 28, police decided to . formally arrest him over the allegations, although the news did not . become public until late last month. The allegations are not linked to the Savile inquiry. Yesterday friends of Harris broke . their silence to defend him, saying the claims against him are ‘utter . rubbish’. Musician Dana Gillespie, who has worked with Harris, said: . ‘I’m amazed that Scotland Yard are wasting their time to do this. He’s . the cleanest living man, the most un-rock’n’roll.’ Harris’s friend and producer Steve Lima said the allegations were ‘completely without foundation’. He said the entertainer had ‘aged ten . years in the last six months’ and was ‘fearful that he might take his . life’. Mr Lima added: ‘I can assure you, as his pal, he has no interest . in children.’ Following the questioning of . Lauren Martell, who lives at Wiseman's Ferry, north of Sydney, a . fortnight ago, two detectives travelled to the city of . Wollongong, 100 miles south of Sydney, to interview a second woman . Harris, who has lived in the UK for . more than 50 years and is married to Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen . Hughes, has not issued any formal statements over the allegations, but . denies any wrongdoing. He met his wife when both were art students in . London. They married in March 1958 and have one daughter, Bindi, an . artist. At last summer’s Diamond Jubilee . concert at Buckingham Palace, Harris led the crowd in an impromptu . rendition of Two Little Boys, his 1969 Christmas No 1 hit. His other . hits include Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport. His detention follows the arrests of . pop star Gary Glitter, comedian Freddie Starr, DJ Dave Lee Travis, . publicist Max Clifford and comedian Jim Davidson. Starr, Travis, Clifford and Davidson . publicly denied any wrongdoing and gave statements after their arrests. Clifford was charged last month with 11 indecent assaults on girls and . young women, including a 14-year-old.

"Detectives investigation sexual abuse allegations against Rolf Harris flew to Australia as part of the inquiry, according to a Sydney television network . British police inquiries into sex abuse allegations against entertainer Rolf Harris have stretched to Australia, a Sydney television network claimed today. Channel Seven said that at least two Scotland Yard detectives flew to Australia in late March as part of their investigations into the allegations against 83-year-old Harris. Harris has a brother who lives in Australia, but it is not known whether he was questioned. The news of the international inquiries came as Coronation Street actor Bill Roache was arrested over claims he raped a 15-year-old girl in 1967. Roache was not held by detectives from Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree, which is investigating ‘historic’ sex crimes in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Channel Seven said it was not clear whether any formal interviews were conducted while the Harris detectives were in Australia. The claims of police inquiries in the country were later reported by at least one Australian newspaper chain, quoting the channel. Sydney's Daily Telegraph said that Scotland Yard would not comment on the investigation. But the paper said the visit by the detectives was reportedly made two weeks before Mr Harris's identity was made public by a British newspaper. Harris' lawyers attempted to bar the . media from reporting on his arrest, but his identity was revealed by . multiple sources two weeks ago. Harris has not been charged with any offence and he has strenuously denied allegations of sexual misconduct. He was arrested in March, but he was released on bail to face further investigations in Britain this month. Roache and Harris are just the latest in a long string of veteran celebrities to be arrested on suspicion of sex offences allegedly committed over the past few decades. Max Clifford, left, has been charged with 11 counts of indecent assault under Operation Yewtree. He denies all allegations. Bill Roache, right, today became the latest veteran celebrity to be arrested on suspicion of historic sexual offences . Convicted paedophile Gary Glitter was . arrested in October last year as part of Operation Yewtree, which was . launched in response to the revelation that entertainer Jimmy Savile had . molested dozens of young girls before his death in 2011. Comedian . Freddie Starr was arrested in November and April,over claims he once . groped a 14-year-old girl in Savile's dressing room. Former DJ Dave Lee Travis was arrested in November and March, on suspicion of offences that he says are not related to children. Jim Davidson, the controversial comedian and TV presenter, was arrested in January in relation to alleged sexual offences. He has denied the allegations. Publicist Max Clifford was arrested in December and last week was charged with 11 counts of indecent assault. He denies all the allegations against him. All of these celebrities were arrested under Operation Yewtree, except Roache.

"When one mingles with the locals, it’s tempting to try out the lingo.

The duchess was clearly thrilled  when . she got to hold the joey – who was wrapped in a cloth bag to mimic her . mother’s pouch – declaring: ‘Oh hello. Very friendly. Doesn’t it look . pretty?’ Rooby Blue was found at the side of a road in the pouch of her mother, who was killed after bounding into the path of a lorry.

The orphan should be released into the wild . after a few more months. Charles also took an interest in Rooby Blue and gave her a pat on the head, prompting his wife to say: ‘That’s  so sweet.’ Farmer Carley Walker, 33, who is . helping nurse the joey back to health, said of the meeting with Camilla: . ‘Rooby is a redhead, so she is by nature temperamental.

"Friends have taken to Facebook to pay tribute to Josh Furber who fell to his death after slipping on rocks near a waterfall . A student who fell to his death after slipping on rocks near a waterfall in Australia had told how he was ‘living out my dreams’ during the trip. Josh Furber, 20, plunged 300ft over a cliff in the Blue Mountains moments after a witness described seeing a group of holidaymakers ‘mucking around’ close to the edge. As police climbers recovered his body yesterday, family and friends paid tribute to the university undergraduate, who is understood to have been four months into a year-long adventure. Last month Mr Furber, from Runcorn, Cheshire, posted on Facebook: ‘This is the best experience of my life and I can honestly say I am living out my dreams.’ New South Wales police said Mr Furber had travelled with friends from Sydney, where he was working as a barman at Bondi Beach. Another visitor, Rosa Petroccitto, claimed the group were ‘skylarking’ and she feared ‘something terrible’ was going to happen. 'I saw a group of French and English kids - you know, adults - mucking around on the rocks and it's very slippery. 'Then they went down to the next one (group of rocks) and I knew something was going to happen. 'We just saw them all panic and a 20-year-old boy fell over 100m down the waterfall.' ‘I saw a group … mucking around on the rocks and it’s very slippery,’ she said. Mr Furber was studying construction management at Leeds Metropolitan University. Scroll down for video . Tragic: The body of a British tourist has been recovered by rescuers after he apparently slipped and fell to his death while with friends in Australia's Blue Mountains, close to Wentworth Falls, pictured . Expert police climbers using abseiling equipment and assisted by a helicopter yesterday recovered his body in what they said was a tricky operation, 24 hours after he slipped from the rocks. His parents, Mark and Jayne, were too upset to comment at their semi-detached home in Runcorn, Cheshire last night. His aunt said: 'Everyone is in pieces. We . are all just so heartbroken.' Family friend Maria Ellis posted on . Facebook: 'Words can't explain how much we are all missing you back . home! You was such amazing lad with big ambitions and had so much more . to achieve. Tragic: The young man was said to have fallen down the waterfall. His was recovered this morning . 'Everyone who knew you known how much of a nice lad you were, nobody could of had anything bad to say about you. 'You loved life and pursued your dreams. You will never be forgotten and you're an inspiration to me and the rest of your friends and family. 'I still can't believe it. Gone far too soon.' College friend Myles McKeever, posted: 'He was an inspiration mate, did what most people in Runcorn can only dream about.' Jord Blackburn, replied: 'He'll do more than what I'll do in a lifetime and many others.' With their distinctive blue-tinged views, the Blue Mountains are popular with tourists for their bush-walking opportunities and spectacular valleys and waterfalls.

Conveniently located: A map shows the location of the Blue Mountains in the Australian state of New South Wales, about 50 miles west of Sydney . But Australian police and forest rangers warned that the area's steep drops, slippery rocks and thick bushland should always be treated with respect - and warning signs should be adhered to. In a letter to a local newspaper, Christopher Woods wrote: 'For the death, don't blame anyone but the ones involved. 'It's not the fault of National Parks or anyone else. 'There are signs on the fence they had to climb over. I walk there often and my warnings to similar fools are always ignored.'","The 20-year-old was with friends near the picturesque Wentworth Falls .

"The King Edward VII Hospital today said the radio station that broadcast the hoax call did not contact senior management or its press office in advance - despite its claims it called five times. Sources also said they were 'extremely . surprised' at the statement from the station because it indicated the . broadcaster was well aware of its responsibility to inform the hospital . of what it had done, yet went on to broadcast the call regardless. The hospital spokesman said: 'Following the hoax call they did not speak to senior management or the company that deals with our media enquiries.' Rhys Holleran, CEO of Austereo, said his team had attempted to liaise with King Edward VII hospital before the bogus royal call was played on Australian radio station . A hospital source added: 'To be honest no-one here is really . apportioning blame at the presenters. They are clearly kids out of their . depth. 'But there are serious questions to be asked of station . management about why they thought it appropriate to prank call a . hospital where there are extremely sick people and to broadcast what . were private medical details about one of its patients.' The Australian radio station 2Day FM has shut down the show which made the royal hoax call. Rhys Holleran, chief executive officer of Austereo, . the owners of 2Day FM, said his team had attempted to liaise with King . Edward VII Hospital before the bogus royal call was played on Australian . radio. He added he believed . his radio station staff had carried out the appropriate level of duty . while performing the hoax in which an update on the Duchess of . Cambridge's medical condition was played live on air. But today it was reported that 2Day FM was being shut down after advertisements were pulled from the show. The boss of the radio station which made the royal hoax call said that his staff had tried to call the hospital five times before the prank was put to air. Pictured is MC and Mel - the DJ's who pranked King Edward VII hospital . The two DJs who made the call 'will not return to the airwaves until further notice,' the statement from the network, Southern Cross Austereo, said. The company also suspended all prank calls, pulled advertising and ordered a comprehensive review of relevant policies and processes, CNN reported. The news comes as Holleran said he believed his staff had carried out the appropriate procedures while performing the hoax call. Under broadcasting rules in Australia, . the permission of anyone ‘caught’ in a radio prank must be sought before . the call can be put to air. Holleran told Melbourne radio station 3AW: ‘We rang them up to discuss what we had recorded – absolutely (before it went to air). ‘We attempted to contact them on five occasions because we wanted to speak to them about it,’ said Mr Holleran. ‘It is absolutely true to say that we did attempt to contact those people.' Sydney radio station 2Day FM presenters Michael Christian, left, and Mel Greig were interviewed by Tracy Grimshaw today despite the fact Greig in particular had been struggling in the wake of the tragedy . He did not say why the recording still went to air when they had failed to contact anyone at the hospital to discuss the prank call. ‘This is a deeply tragic, unforeseen circumstance,’ he said. ‘We’re deeply saddened by the events. This is an incredible tragedy, there’s no getting away from that. ‘When anything’s done, it’s done in a collaborative sense. Our people are very well trained’. The Australian Communications and Media Authority has begun an investigation into the prank and the furore that has followed in the wake of the suicide of nurse Jacintha Saldanha. In another interview today Holleran refused to say if the station followed . regulator's guidelines and contacted the two nurses involved to ask . their permission to air the segment. Australia's Channel Ten show The Project Holleran was asked three times if either nurse had been spoken to about their involvement in the call made by Sydney's 2Day FM deejays Mel Greig and Michael Christian. Holleran said: 'We have a process and procedure in place and we followed those procedures.' Missed: Jacintha Saldanha who committed suicide pictured with her husband Ben Barboza . When pushed again to answer by co-host Charlie Pickering to state whether he followed the Australian Communications and Media Authority's guidelines to get consent, he said: 'Again I'm telling you we did the appropriate review on the issue.' Pickering asked him again whether the nurses were aware of their involvement. Holleran said: 'We went on the record this morning, we attempted to contact the hospital on five occasions. 'If you look at the prank as the prank, 24 hours before this tragedy it was a light hearted attempt by two young presenters to do something with a dodgy accent. 'We have ended up with a consequence that no one could have predicted that's the tragedy. 'They are people that are affected by this tragedy, too. 'That's the reality. I am deeply sorry. These guys are deeply sorry.' Holleran was asked if anyone in authority above the DJs was at the station when the call was made last Tuesday. Poignant: Jacintha Saldanha was described as 'profoundly caring' Tragic: The grieving family of nurse Jacintha Saldanha who died in a suspected suicide told of their devastation at her death. She is pictured centre, with son Junal and daughter Lisha . He said: 'I think that is an important question to ask and I want to make it clear that these two individuals operated with the normal procedures that we have within our business. I think that it is important that these two individuals did not recklessly put something to air. It went through a process.' The Project presenters said they interviewed Holleran instead of Christian and Greig because it was felt it wasn't right to speak to the two DJs who are in an 'emotional state'. Holleran said the pair were 'holding up' in the face of the controversy: . He said: 'They are taking each day as it comes. There are genuine concerns for the family. This is just a tragic event, this is not something anyone could have reasonably foreseen. These guys, their primary motivation at the moment is the wellbeing of the family, it has been nothing short of a tragedy.' Tragedy: Jacintha Saldanha transferred a prank call from two Australian DJs who found out intimate details about Prince William's wife Kate Middleton who was staying at the hospital suffering from morning sickness . Despite the fact Greig in particular had been struggling in the wake of the tragedy, the radio station put both presenters up to be interviewed which Holleran defended: 'We had a long discussion with Mel and MC and it was something which they felt they wanted to do. 'They feel great sadness about the tragic event. It was their decision. We also took into account the professional people we have helping these two young people and we took all of this into account.' When asked by presenter Carrie Bickmore if he might regret allowing them to speak, Holleran said: 'I think these two individuals had been lined up and promoted as the architects of all this I felt strongly they wanted to say we are hurting and we are deeply concerned about the family. 'This is not something they take trivially or lightly. It's a prank that would happen all the time within the radio industry across the world. No one could have foreseen what happened, they thought it was important that they do this.' When asked if Greig and Christian were in the right mindset to speak out, Holleran said: 'I think there are lots of views on that. We sought their consent and professionals' views on the issue. It was thought this was a good step to do.' Holleran said the station had suspended all prank calls: 'We have taken all such calls off air until we can conduct a further review of what we will do in the future.'","Chief executive officer of Austereo said team attempted to liaise with King Edward VII hospital before it was played on radio but could not get through .

"The strain was etched on Zara Phillips’s face yesterday just hours after video footage of her new husband cosying up to a pretty fan emerged. The images, from CCTV cameras at a rowdy New Zealand bar where England rugby players partied on Sunday, clearly show captain Mike Tindall kissing the blonde and leaving with her. It was claimed yesterday that the girl is a friend of the couple who attended their wedding. Despite desperate attempts by the England camp to play down the players’ wild night out, the leaked recording instantly became a worldwide internet sensation. Long faces: Zara Phillips looks pained, pictured at the International Horse Trials at Watergrasshill in County Cork, Ireland. Later, however, her mood did brighten and she managed a smile . Although his behaviour was initially . dismissed as just ‘boisterous horseplay’, Tindall, 32, can be seen . hugging and groping the woman as they knock back shots of cheap vodka at . the Altitude bar in Queenstown. It had also initially been  suggested . that the pair did not leave the bar together, but the newly released . video also puts paid to that. Tindall can plainly be seen taking the female partygoer by the hand and pulling her across the dancefloor towards the exit. From that point, the colour footage . changes to black and white film from different CCTV cameras positioned . around the bar’s entrance. As they stand by the doors, the pair openly cuddle before the woman pulls Tindall towards her chest and kisses his shaven head. Scroll down to view video . Headlock: The mystery blonde pulls Mike Tindall's shaven head towards her bosom at the Altitude club in New Zealand where some England team-mates relaxed . Cuddle: Tindall is seen on CCTV putting his arm round the girl at the nightclub in New Zealand . Hugger: World Cup captain Tindall closes in on the mystery blonde  as he heads towards the exit . Outside on the street she appears to . make several half-hearted attempts to return inside to her friends, but . the player puts her in an affectionate headlock to prevent her from . doing so and pulls her towards him. The pair then walk off out of shot, . entwined in each other’s arms. Miss Phillips, 30, continued to decline . to comment about the scandal yesterday but friends insisted that the . incident had ‘been blown out of all proportion’. One source close to the Queen’s . granddaughter, who has been married for just six weeks, claimed the . woman was ‘a friend’ of the couple and had even been a guest at their . wedding in July. ‘She is a friend of both Mike and Zara and has known Mike since university days,’ they said. Touching: Tindall gets up front and personal with the buxom blonde at the bar . Face to face: Another girl and Tindall have an intimate chat at the bar where later he was seen cuddling her blonde friend . Flirting: Tindall and the girl at the bar where the England captain and team-mates had gone to relax after they beat Argentina in their first World Cup match . ‘She is an English girl living in . Australia who was at their wedding. Zara is very relaxed about all this . and the whole thing has been blown out of all proportion.’ It is understood that Miss Phillips . has spoken to her husband about the incident and still plans to join him . in New Zealand, where England are competing in the Rugby World Cup, . later this month. Another source, who claimed to have spoken to Zara personally, claimed she had dismissed the entire furore as ‘irrelevant’. ‘She has no problem whatsoever with anything Mike has done,’  they maintained. But as she competed at the Johnson . & Perrott Land Rover International Horse Trials at Watergrasshill . near Cork, Ireland, Miss Phillips, a world champion three-day eventer . who has  hopes of representing her country in the Olympics next year, . appeared under stress. Scrum: New Royal and England rugby captain Mike Tindall grabs Dylan Hartley and Chris Ashton as they party at the Altitude bar in New Zealand's south island . Pint-sized: England's Chris Ashton looks like he needs a hand as he parties with two dwarfs . Despite an almost flawless dressage . routine on her horse, Lord Lauries, and a small smile to the crowd . following her eight-minute routine, as she was driven away from the . course on the back of an electric golf buggy she pulled down her hat and . covered her face with her hand. Newlyweds: Mike Tindall and Zara Phillips have only been married for 48 days, but he has been criticised for his 'behaviour' at a nightclub . Tindall, who captained the team in . their unconvincing win over Argentina last Saturday but is being rested . this weekend, was among a group of more than half a dozen internationals . that ended up in the grimy Altitude bar following a night of heavy . drinking.

At an . England team press conference yesterday, manager Martin Johnson . continued to defend his players, Tindall in particular. He said their antics were simply a . case of the team ‘letting off steam’ the day after their first match, . explaining: ‘[The] players said, “We’re going to go out for a beer on . Sunday night” and I said, “Great idea”. You’ve got to relieve the . pressure valve, let off steam, at the right time. In the pressure of a . World Cup you’ve got to find those opportunities. I had no problem with . them doing that.’ Asked whether he felt betrayed by . their antics, he added: ‘No, I don’t. We knew the players were going to . go out and have a few beers. People can report it how they want to . report it. The guys are fully aware of their responsibilities. No one . likes to be on the front page of papers but we know where the world is . at the moment. ‘I’ve got a choice to lock them away . and keep them out of the public in all forms or we get on and try to . enjoy this tournament and be successful. I’d rather do that. Mike knows . his responsibilities. He fully understands that. ‘I’ve had my arms around 50 women in . Queenstown aged from seven months to 77. Everyone wants to get a piece . of you and get their photograph taken with you.We either lock ourselves . away and don’t talk to anyone or we try to enjoy the experience at the . right time, in the right place and in the right way.

Tindall’s team-mate Chris Ashton, who . was present in the bar, also defended their behaviour but admitted they . needed to be ‘more careful’ in the future. ‘We had a night out and a day off. It . does everyone a favour. It gives us all a laugh, makes everyone . relaxed,’ he said. ‘There’s not much in it. It’s just lads having a . night out... We genuinely don’t see anything in it. We just ended up in . that bar – not specifically for the dwarf-racing. ‘If you have a picture with fans and . they happen to be girls you can make anything you want with it.’ The . players’ antics were captured on CCTV, footage of which was broadcast . over the internet yesterday by a bouncer at the club named Jonathan . Dixon, who claimed he was releasing it due to his disgust at Tindall’s . behaviour. Although he subsequently withdrew it . after pressure from friends, he claimed in an internet video that he . wasn’t ‘making a cent’ out of the film, adding: ‘I’m a man who feels . very sorry for what Mike Tindall has done to the Royal Family. ‘The way he behaved is not the way . decent people, particularly when you have been married for only a few . weeks, behave. 'Mr Tindall, your behaviour was that of someone . unbecoming, especially to someone such as the Queen or  Zara Phillips.’ The bar’s manager, Rich Deane, said . Dixon’s contract has been withdrawn for releasing CCTV footage without . permission and  the incident has been reported  to police.

"With a bright complexion and a twinkle in her eye, Camilla is clearly still enjoying that holiday glow. The Duchess of Cornwall looked the picture of health as she accompanied Prince Charles on the Jubilee tour of Papua New Guinea - no doubt thanks to her recent luxury break in southern India. Camilla spent a week at the Soukya International Holistic Centre in Bangalore, where she is thought to have stayed in the centre's £3,500-a-night presidential suite, ahead of the three week Royal tour.

"Big news: British soldier Lynette Pearce was shocked when she gave birth to a baby in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan . The father of the frontline soldier who gave birth in Afghanistan claimed last night that his daughter had heaped shame on his family and the Army. Maurice Wallace told of his fury that she had failed to tell her parents about the baby and that Army officials ‘could not be bothered’ to contact them. Lance Bombardier Lynette Pearce, 28, who did not know she was pregnant, had spent months fighting the Taliban with the Royal Artillery when she unexpectedly went into labour. Miss Pearce, who is originally from Fiji, gave birth to her son in a surgical theatre at Camp Bastion two days after complaining of severe abdominal cramps. Mr Wallace, a police officer in Fiji, said his daughter had shown ‘great disrespect to the Army – and the Army has shown great disrespect to me and my family by their silence over this affair’. He said he only learned yesterday that Miss Pearce was the soldier who had given birth on the frontline. He added: ‘It’s a total disgrace. We’ve got a thousand questions – who is the father, what does this mean for her future, will she have to leave the Army?’ Speaking to the Daily Mail from his home near the Fijian west coast town of Nadi, he said: ‘I’m furious with her because she hasn’t been in touch with us since she had the child and I’m livid with all those British officials who had a duty to contact me immediately. ‘Lynette has been doing her duty for the British so isn’t it right that the Army should have done their duty to her family and contacted us immediately about the birth? Relaxed: Lynette in her army slacks - she had no idea she was having a baby . Rush: After complaining of severe stomach pains, the 28-year-old was rushed into a surgical theatre at Camp Bastion - the biggest British base in  Helmand province - where the baby was delivered . ‘My wife Sukra and I are that baby’s grandparents, yet we’ve been the last to know what’s going on. It’s outrageous.’ ‘I’m a proud Fijian. My daughter, I . know, is a proud Fijian, yet I feel totally humiliated by her silence . and the silence of officials from the other side of the world. ‘My wife and I are in total despair. As I talk to you right now I’m a mixture of pride and sadness. It’s a total mess. ‘If she didn’t know she was carrying a . baby, well, we can’t blame her for not telling us – but since the birth . surely the Army could have arranged for her to have a phone at her . bedside so she could call us and tell us the news personally.’ Mr Wallace added: ‘How will others in . the Army now view her, because I can’t get it out of my mind, with my . eldest son also in the Army, that she has shown disrespect to the force. 'No doubt there will be congratulations but I’m not in the mood for any . of that. ‘I’m still very, very angry at our . treatment by our daughter and the officials. The British Embassy in Fiji . could have easily tracked me down but they just haven’t bothered.’ Popular: Lynette on left and friend Hayley Firstfoot Jefford at their Hampshire base . A family friend added: ‘You can . understand how upset they [Miss Pearce’s parents] are. 'They’ve been in . occasional touch with Lynette but to learn nothing about her having a . baby until now has come as a big shock to them. ‘They’ll try not to show it because they’re proud Fijians. But you can be assured they’re really hurting.’ Miss Pearce uses her mother’s maiden name as she was born before the couple married, said Mr Wallace. An accomplished athlete, Miss Pearce . was captain of the Fiji women’s football team from 2007 to 2009, leading . matches against Tonga and Australia. She left the country last year to . fulfil her ambition of serving in the Army and, after completing her . basic training, was deployed in March this year. She had undergone rigorous physical . testing including a five-mile run, press-ups and sit-ups before she was . passed fit but, crucially, did not receive a pregnancy test. Friends . said Miss Pearce was surprised when she began putting on weight despite . the gruelling training regime. One said: ‘A baby was growing inside . her, that was why she was putting on weight, but Lynette had no idea at . the time. Now it all makes sense and everyone is so relieved.’ Birth place: The birth stunned military chiefs and came just four days after the Taliban's deadly attack on Camp Bastion that was intended to kill Prince Harry . The MOD has not disclosed where Lynette and her baby are being treated but it is understood to be the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford (pictured) Miss Pearce’s baby boy was born five . weeks premature in the 34th week of her pregnancy at Camp Bastion’s . £10million field hospital. A specialist paediatric ‘retrieval . team’, including a midwife, a neonatal nurse and an incubator, was sent . to care for Miss Pearce and her son on the flight back to the UK. Mother and baby are now at the John . Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. A new mother at the hospital, who asked . not to be named, said: ‘She is doing well. She is smiling a lot so . that’s good.’","Maurice Wallace tells of fury at daughter Lance Bombardier Lynette Pearce .

"Controversial: Francesca Minerva says doctors should have the right to kill newborn babies because they are disabled, too expensive or simply unwanted by their mothers . An academic with links to Oxford University has received death threats after claiming that killing newborn babies is no different to aborting them because they are not ‘actual persons’. Dr Francesca Minerva said that the days since her paper was published in a medical journal have been ‘the worst in my life.’ She said she has received a series of hate messages claiming she would ‘burn in hell’. In her paper in the British Medical Journal, Dr Minerva, who is based at the University of Melbourne but is also a research associate at Oxford, suggested that killing newborn babies was no different from abortion. The article, titled ‘After-birth abortion: Why should the baby live?’ was written by her and Alberto Giubilini of the University of Milan. The paper suggests newborn babies are not ‘actual persons’ and do not have a ‘moral right to life’ because they ‘lack those properties that justify the attribution of a right to live of an individual.’ After receiving death threats and angry messages, she asked for people to understand the perspective of her work. ‘This is not a political paper - this is not a proposal for law,’ she told the website ninemsn. ‘This is pure academic, theoretical discussion.’ In her article she says that ‘both a foetus and a newborn certainly are human beings and potential persons, but neither is a “person” in the sense of a “subject of a moral right to life.”’ She adds: ‘We take “person” to mean an individual who is capable of attributing to her own existence some (at least) basic value such that being deprived of this existence represents a loss to her.’ Dr Minerva and her research colleague continue: ‘What we call “after-birth abortion” (killing a newborn) should be . permissible in all the cases where abortion is, including cases where . the newborn is not disabled.' Right to decide: Dr Minerva argues a young baby is not a real person and so killing it in the first days after birth is little different to aborting it in the womb . As the hate calls came in, Dr Minerva told the website that she had not been expecting the overwhelmingly negative reaction. She said she believes her argument was taken out of its academic and theoretical context. ‘I wish I could explain to people it is not a policy, and I’m not suggesting that and I’m not encouraging that’. She believes the majority of threats have come from religious or Pro-Life groups. Some of the hate messages told her that she would be punished by God, while others suggested she should ‘burn in hell’. Professor Julian Savulescue, editor of the journal, said arguments about killing newborns were ‘largely not new’. He said the goal of the journal was to ‘present well-reasoned argument based on widely accepted premises.’ Joanna Jepson: 'A compelling reason to stop late-term abortions' Rev Joanna Jepson, an opponent of late abortions, said what the ethicists had proposed was little more than infanticide. The female vicar first came to public attention when she spoke out against a late abortion that had been carried out in 2001. Doctors . are permitted to carry out abortions beyond the 24-week legal limit if . they believe a baby's disability is serious enough, but Joanna argued . that a cleft palate was a minor physical flaw, not a severe abnormality. She revealed that, . until she had surgery at the age of 19, her own face was disfigured by a . congenital defect. Her upper jaw overhung her lower jaw, which receded . into her neck. She posed the question: 'Would it have been right to . abort me?' She said: 'It's . misleading to call this 'after birth abortion'. The pregnancy is already . over, there is nothing to abort. What is being discussed is . infanticide. 'There is a . logic to their point - if we consider it acceptable to abort a baby up . until birth then why not allow it to die afterwards? It is just a . difference in geography - within or outside the mother's body. 'Of . course, I would see this a compelling reason to abolish late-term . abortion, if infanticide is morally repulsive then abortion is too. 'If . a baby, because of it's physical disabilities, is seen as being . ""incompatible with life"" then we need to let life and death take its . course. Becoming agents of death fundamentally changes doctor's role as . healer and physician, and it also has massive repercussions on society's . conscience shifting what is understood to be morally and socially . unacceptable to become acceptable. Of . course motherhood is inconvenient, physically, emotionally, . psychologically, financially - but this inconvenience is not allowed to . become acceptable grounds for abandoning one's child.

Mass grave: Yewden Villa in Buckinghamshire . While infanticide may seem an inhumane concept for many people, there have been periods in history where it has been accepted behaviour - and even a legal obligation. In Roman culture, disabled infants were often abandoned after birth by parents who did not want or could not afford the financial burden. The child would simply be left outside to die from starvation and the elements in a practice known as 'exposure'. It was an established and acceptable procedure. In 1912, Yewsden Villa (right) was excavated in Hambleden in Buckinghamshire, and researchers were shocked to find the bodies of 97 babies in a mass-grave. The babies had apparently all been killed shortly after birth, and the prevailing theory is that the site was near a brothel. With a lack of contraception in Roman times, unwanted pregnancies would likely have been much more common, and the mass grave is another example that infanticide did not pose such an ethical dilemma in that era. Archaeologists believe Romans did not consider infants to be 'full' human beings until about the age of two, and babies who died before that age were not buried in cemeteries, but instead in public or domestic areas. However a Roman couple were entitled to raise a disabled child. In Sparta, there was little choice in the matter. Newborns were seen as the property of the state and all babies were inspected by a community leader. If the child showed signs of deformity or ill-health, the parents were ordered to expose it. Many parents in ancient Greeks would also expose their newborns because of sickness, financial pressure, or simply for being the 'wrong' sex in the male-dominated society. Many religions had did not raise moral objects to infanticide, although Christianity and Islam notably rejected it. Leaving the child to the elements was the preferred method to 'dispose' of the child, because it meant the child died of natural causes, which was a more 'moral' death than directly killing the child. The practice generally died out, and was outlawed in the last years of the Roman Empire. However there are references to infanticide in many cultures in every historical era, and is believed to still take place in certain parts of India, Africa, and China. China's controversial 'one-child' policy leads to many children being abandoned after birth. Trevor . Stammers, a lecturer in medical ethics and former chairman of the . Christian Medical Fellowship, described the viewpoint as ‘chilling’. Gill . Duval, of the ProLife Alliance, said every life is precious and added: . ‘Everybody talks about what women want but women wouldn’t want this.’ Lord Alton, chairman of the All Party . Parliamentary Group on Pro-Life, told the Catholic Herald: ‘It is . profoundly disturbing, indeed shocking, to see the way in which . opinion-formers within the medical profession have ditched the . professional belief of the healer to uphold the sanctity of human life . for this impoverished and inhumane defence of child destruction.’ Julian Savulescu, the journal’s editor, said that the article’s argument has been made before by eminent figures. He added: ‘I’m not defending practising infanticide. I’m defending academic and intellectual freedom.’ He said that Dr Minerva has a ‘loose relationship’ with Oxford and her main position is at the University of Melbourne.

"On any other day, she would certainly have stood out from the crowd. But the Queen almost blended into the background at a children’s hospital in Australia yesterday – because the staff’s shocking pink uniforms perfectly matched her Stewart Parvin crepe coat. The monarch couldn’t help smiling when she spotted the co-ordinated line-up that awaited her as she opened the £65million Royal Children’s Hospital in Melbourne. Seeing the funny side: The Queen smiles at how the nurses' shocking pink uniforms match her Stewart Parvin crepe coat . It came on the same day it was revealed that the Queen’s grandson William and his wife Kate will help victims of . famine in East Africa by packing aid boxes for UNICEF. Elsewhere in Melbourne, the Queen continued attracting plenty of attention – particularly when she swapped her usual chauffeur-driven cars for a trip on public transport. As she settled into a seat on the number 72 tram for an eight-minute journey along St Kilda Road, her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, joked to driver Joyleen Smith: ‘Let’s go. We’re running late!’ The pair’s seniors’ concessions tickets – at £1.80 each – were paid for by their Australian equerry, Commander Andrew Willis.

"Soccer mad: Rhiannon Conelly, 16, an Americas High School junior from El Paso, Texas forfeited the cash prize to go to Spain to meet the player . A soccer mad teenager gave up a prize of $10,000 to meet her idol, Neymar da Silva Santos Jr. — the Brazilian soccer player. Rhiannon Conelly, 16, an Americas High School junior from El Paso, Texas is so in love with the beautiful game that she forfeited the cash prize for a chance to go to Spain to meet the player instead. She won a contest sponsored by the Brazilian soft-drink firm Guaraná Antarctica and the goalie will travel to Spain next year to meet Neymar. But her decision has not gone down well with her family and friends, who think that she should have taken the cash prize and forgotten all about meeting Neymar. She told The El Paso Times: 'I just wanted to meet Neymar, I thought that was more important than the $10,000. Everyone disagrees with that, but I'm sticking to my guns.' Today, she is looking forward to her  upcoming meeting in 2015. 'It feels good. I mean to go to Spain and meet your idol, it feels awesome.' The teenager will take her mom and her coach along with her. Her personal coach Gerardo Alvarez said he was happy to be included in the trip. He added that he had no doubt that Conelley would meet Neymar some day, it was only a matter of time. 'She's pretty good at what she does,' he said. 'The star was going to meet the rising star.' Neymar, the Brazilian soccer player is known among fans worldwide for his flamboyant hairstyles, fancy footwork and character - which dazzles followers of the Brazilian national soccer team. At just 22-years-old, he is already ranked as one of the most interesting players to watch. Connelly said the forward has the potential to be like Lionel Messi and could even win a sixth World Cup championship for his team Brazil. However, while she is certain that he is a brilliant player, she is still thinking of what things she will say to him when they meet face-to-face. Champion: Connelly, left, entered the competition during the World Cup and beat over 2000 entrants .

Flamboyant: The Brazilian soccer player is known among fans worldwide for his flamboyant hairstyles, fancy footwork and big character - which dazzles followers of the Brazilian national soccer team . 'I'll ask him if he wants to marry me,' she said jokingly. Adding: 'I don't want to scare him too much, I don't want him to call security to kick me out.' Connelly entered the competition  during the World Cup earlier this year. Organizers said that there were over 2,000 entries and 4,000 votes. The contest  required Neymar fans to submit their pictures. Most were photographed in Brazilian regalia, and others were pictured with a football and they all had a Guaraná soft drink on hand. Conelley got her image in the back of the net when she submitted a photo in June featuring her wearing the Brazilian jersey, while doing 'dominadas' or soccer tricks.

"Finger lickin': The Southern chef, 67, was a popular host on the Food Network for 13 years and has purchased 440 episodes along with previously unseen footage . Embattled TV chef Paula Deen has bought the rights to the TV shows and video that she starred in during her career on the Food Network. The Southern chef, 67, was a popular host on the Food Network for over 13 years and has purchased 440 episodes along with previously unseen footage ahead of the launch of her online TV network. Her company, ‘Paula Deen Ventures’ said it plans to show the footage on her new network which launches on Wednesday. The network will be subscriber-based and will use www.PaulaDean.com as a portal, to air video of Deen and guests cooking in front of a studio audience. Deen’s company is expected to charge between $7.99 and $9.99 a month for access to the broadcasts. It is backed by a $100 million private-equity investment from Phoenix-based Najafi Cos. A spokesperson for the Food Network told The Wall Street Journal: ‘I can share that Paula asked if we'd be willing to sell the library; we reached an agreement, and everyone here wishes her the best as she embarks on her new venture.’ The celebrity chef, who counted billionaire Oprah Winfrey as one of her close friends has had a tumultuous few years mired by a race hate scandal. Scroll down for video . N-word: The celebrity chef counted billionaire Oprah Winfrey as one of her close friends but has had a tumultuous few years mired by a race hate scandal . In 2012, a former manager at Deen's restaurants in Savannah, Georgia, sued her and her brother for sexual and racial harassment. Lisa T. Jackson's lawsuit alleged that Deen and Bubba committed violence, discrimination and racism which ended her five-year employment at Deen's Lady & Sons and Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House eateries in Savannah. In a deposition in court, Deen acknowledged using the ‘N word,’ but not telling racial jokes. In June last year, she issued a grovelling, tearful video apology for her use of the word. ‘I want to apologize to everybody for the wrong that I've done,’ Deen said in the video statement. ‘I want to learn and grow from this. Inappropriate and hurtful language is totally, totally unacceptable. I've made plenty of mistakes along the way but I beg you, my children, my team, my fans, my partners, I beg for your forgiveness.’ Popular: Paula Deen appears on NBC News' Today show before her scandals rocked her cooking empire . Since then, her vast food empire has taken a hit and many of her fans have deserted her. She was dropped by The Food Network and a host of other sponsors. But the chef, known for her love of cooking fried food, still has a loyal fan base and is hoping to capitalize on this by going digital. In the wake of the scandal fans sent origami-folded butter wrappers to the Food Network and other companies that dropped the popular chef and cookbook author as a sign of protest. Her network said it has plans  to broadcast a self-produced documentary next year about the ups-and-downs that she has faced over the past few years. Family affair: Jamie Deen, left, Paula Deen, and Bobby Deen attend KitchenAid® Culinary Demonstrations in 2014, Deen plans to air  several new programs online featuring her two sons, who are also chefs . In 2012, just before the race scandal exploded, Deen announced that she had developed Type-2 Diabetes. However, she was widely criticized for promoting her brand of high-fat, sugary Southern cuisine while also endorsing a diabetes drug. She is now hoping that her new network will give her a degree of creative and financial control. ‘That's the beauty of what we're doing now. We have total and complete control,’ she said. ‘If we disagree on something, we can discuss it right then and there. We don't have to put it before a group in a tall building somewhere. We can discuss it right there. It's as real as it can get’ she told The Wall Street Journal. Deen's network also plans to air several new programs, featuring herself and her two sons Jamie and Bobby, who are also chefs. Yet despite her latest move aimed at rejuvenating her career Deen admits that her past scandals may always haunt her. In February she told People magazine: ‘I feel like 'embattled' or 'disgraced' will always follow my name.’ ‘It's like that black football player who recently came out,’ she said, referring to Michael Sam. ‘He (Sam) said, 'I just want to be known as a football player. I don't want to be known as a gay football player.' I know exactly what he's saying.’","The Southern chef, 67, was a popular  Food Network host for 13 years .

"Kim cancelled her bridal shower at the hotel last month, after the Sultan of Brunei introduced Sharia law calling for gays to be stoned . Now, she joins the likes of Russell Crowe and Rose McGowan hitting out at the Hollywood boycott of the revered 102-year-old retreat . Reality star claims the loss of business 'doesn't even make a dent in the Sultan's fortunes' Refuses to punish 'hard-working' staff that she has known since she was a little girl . Kim Kardashian has become the latest celebrity to speak out against the Hollywood boycott that has crippled the business of The Beverly Hills Hotel. The hotel is said to have been almost empty in recent months after its owner, the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, introduced Sharia law in the Southeast Asian state, which calls for homosexuals to be stoned to death. In a lengthy post on her website, Kim, 33, has confessed that after originally supporting the protest - including cancelling her planned bridal shower at the hotel last month - she has now had a change of heart. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Kim Kardashian has weighed into the Hollywood boycott of The Beverly Hills Hotel in a lengthy blog post where she champions the 'hard working' staff of the establishment . Controversial figure: Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah, pictured here in 2012 at Windsor Castle in Berkshire, UK . Kim explains that while 'the actions and law enforcements of the Sultan are completely against everything we believe in' the reality star is worried for the staff of the hotel, some of whom she has known since she was a little girl. 'For a sultan that has 20 billion dollars, this loss of business doesn’t even make a dent in his fortunes,' Kim writes, in a blog most titled 'My thoughts'. 'But the hotel staff are being negatively affected every day with the boycott that has gone on for weeks now.' Boycott: The hotel is said to have been almost empty in recent weeks after its owner, the Sultan of Brunei, introduced Sharia law in his country, which calls for homosexuals to be stoned to death . Joining forces: Russell Crowe has also spoken out against the ban . She added: 'We shouldn’t punish the amazing hard-working people who have been so good to us for years! When I was a little girl, I would ride my bike to the Beverly Hills Hotel on the weekends to eat downstairs in the coffee shop with my dad (her lawyer father, Robert Kardashian)'. Kim even revealed that during her pregnancy with daughter North West, she had befriended a waitress at the hotel who was also with child, and were both due just a few weeks apart. 'We would always share our pregnancy stories with each other. I know for a fact she has a new baby at home that she has to feed, so this boycott is affecting her tremendously,' she remembered. Kim had been part of a growing number of stars, including Ellen DeGeneres, Sharon Osbourne and Stephen Fry who have boycotted the Dorchester Collection hotels - including the revered 102-year-old retreat - in protest at the law. Now, the reality star has joined the likes of Russell Crowe and Rose McGowan who have hit back at the ban by celebrities. Last month, Russell wrote on Twitter that didn't agree with the boycott as it hits hard-working staff he considers his 'friends'. Still showing support: Kim, pictured today in Calabasas, has revealed that she no longer supports the Hollywood ban of the The Beverly Hills Hotel . Anti-protest: Charmed actress Rose McGowan pictured last month, hosting a reception 'Take Back The BHH' in support of the hotel's staff . Meanwhile, Charmed actress Rose decided to hold a 'gay-in' cocktail party at the hotel, rather than boycott it. She wrote: 'I want to assemble a group of men and women (and hopefully some adulteresses,) that would be stoned in Brunei but that will be welcome at the BH,' Kim also made clear in her post that the 'unjust treatment and violation of rights of the LGBT community around the world is never justified and I will continue to proudly support the LGBT community in every way imaginable.' Meanwhile, the hotel is said to have promised to guarantee the jobs, income, gratuities, and benefits of all of its employees following the international backlash against the Sultan’s horrific new laws. My Thoughts . My best friend Allison and I wanted to take our babies out to lunch a few days ago after our baby class but there were so many paparazzi swarming us, it would have really scared them. Instead we had to feed them at her place and put them down for a nap. We were planning on taking them to the Beverly Hills Hotel, which is where we always go because they respect not having any paparazzi drive onto their property, but I reminded Allison that my bridal shower was moved from that hotel due to the actions of the Sultan of Brunei. Allison shared with me her view on the situation and we 100% agree that the actions and law enforcements of the Sultan are completely against everything we believe in.However, I started to realize that maybe boycotting the hotel isn’t the best solution either. For a sultan that has 20 billion dollars, this loss of business doesn’t even make a dent in his fortunes. But the hotel staff are being negatively affected every day with the boycott that has gone on for weeks now… We shouldn’t punish the amazing hard-working people who have been so good to us for years! When I was a little girl, I would ride my bike to the Beverly Hills Hotel on the weekends to eat downstairs in the coffee shop with my dad, and some of the same people still work there! It’s sad to see them suffering from this protest.There must be other ways to express our views without punishing the workers, some who I know personally have families at home and depend on the city’s business and tips to survive. When I was pregnant, the hotel was my safe haven. There’s one waitress that works downstairs who was also pregnant at the same time as me and due just a few weeks apart. We would always share our pregnancy stories with each other. I know for a fact she has a new baby at home that she has to feed, so this boycott is affecting her tremendously. The hotel is a piece of LA’s history as well as many of our own personal memories.I support Rose McGowan and Russell Crowe’s takes on this matter. The unjust treatment and violation of rights of the LGBT community around the world is never justified and I will continue to proudly support the LGBT community in every way imaginable. I do believe though that instead of this boycott, there has to be another solution. I’m glad to hear that industry executives like Jeffrey Katzenberg and Casey Wasserman are reaching out to leaders of the hotel chain to discuss a way to potentially end the protest. I hope we can come together and stand up for our beliefs while still making sure good people aren’t wrongfully hurt in the process. Boycotting the hotel won’t affect the sultan, just our dear friends who work there. For every warm smile when they greet us and for all the dedication they put in to make our experiences more enjoyable, I hope we can return the same love and compassion to make sure they’re not forgotten during this protest. XoWith love, Kim .","Kim cancelled her bridal shower at the hotel last month, after the Sultan of Brunei introduced Sharia law calling for gays to be stoned .

"Shock jock Don Imus  asked Joan Rivers' personal doctor 'who the effin idiot was' who went  to the clinic' with her on the day she died  – before finding out it was her. The veteran broadcaster revealed that he had been a patient of Dr Gwen Korovin, a Manhattan doctor 'known as the throat specialist to the stars' for decades and recently went to visit her. However, during his conversation, he was unaware that Dr Korovin had been Rivers' personal doctor and she was the one who went with the star to Yorkville Endoscopy clinic on August 28. Scroll down for video . Conversation: Don Imus has told how he could not get Dr Gwen Korovin to talk about Joan Rivers sudden death . Response: The 56-year-old, pictured outside her Manhattan home this weekend, has released a statement via her lawyers which says she cannot comment on the tragic incident which led to the 81-year-old's death . Tragic: It has been reported that Joan Rivers vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest . Imus told listeners of his 'Imus in the Morning' show that she refused to say a word about the star's tragic death when he quizzed her for more information on what could had gone wrong. And the 56-year-old Manhattan doctor, who specializes in ear, nose and throat procedures kept quiet despite allegedly being linked to the throat biopsy that led to Rivers' heart attack. On Friday's show, he said: ‘So I said, 'Why wouldn't' Joan Rivers see somebody like you?' ‘Who was the 'effin idiot who went with her to the clinic?' he recalled asking. ‘What did she say?’ his show sidekick Bernie McGuirk asked. ‘She didn't say anything, of course,’ Imus replied. A few days later, Imus said he realized his mistake. Rivers arrived at the Upper East side clinic for an endoscopy with gastroenterologist Dr. Lawrence Cohen, Yorkville's medical director, on the morning on August 28. The procedure was intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat. An ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - then performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords. The doctor was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist who is reported to be Dr Korovin. According to CNN, Dr Korovin allegedly snapped a selfie with Rivers while the 81-year-old was under anesthesia. But Imus said he couldn't imagine Dr Korovin, whom he called a ‘marvelous physician,’ stopping the procedure to snap a pic. Imus said: ‘I would bet a lot of money she didn't take a selfie. Why would she need to take a selfie?’ Dr Korovin counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, pop princess Ariana Grande and Celine Dion among her celebrity patients. She proudly boasts a wall full of thank you notes from some of Hollywood's biggest stars. But it has been reported that during Rivers visit, her vocal chords began to swell during the biopsy, cutting off the flow of oxygen to her lungs, which led to cardiac arrest. The comedienne was then rushed to nearby Mount Sinai hospital from the clinic but never regained consciousness and died days later on September 4 after being taken off life support. 'Specialist to the stars': Dr Korovin  counts celebrities including Hugh Jackman - who performed at Joan Rivers' funeral, Daniel Radcliffe (pictured in frame), Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande among her clients . Yet Imus said he was surprised to hear Dr Korovin would have performed a biopsy. He revealed that a few years ago, she had discovered a lump and 'white stuff' on his vocal cords, but sent him to another doctor to get a biopsy. ‘If she did biopsies, why didn't she do one on me? She had plenty of opportunity,’ he said. Imus said he plans to continue seeing Dr Korovin despite her alleged connection to Rivers death. ‘I will continue to see her. Unless she says lets go over to the clinic,’ he said jokingly. Dr Korovin - who was not authorized to be in the room at the time of the fatal treatment - has also released a statement saying she has 'no comment' to make about the tragic incident. Attorneys from Abrams and Fensterman said in the statement that she is 'respected and admired' in the medical community, but will not be discussing the incident further. It read: 'Gwen S. Korovin M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. 'She maintains privileges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

"England's 2-1 defeat to Uruguay has left millions depressed, but these images lampooning captain Steven Gerrard and even the Queen might raise a wry smile as they swept across the internet today. The memes also celebrate Luis Suarez, the destroyer of Roy Hodgson's side's World Cup hopes, and show the Liverpool striker who scored twice last night as Superman and even with Her Majesty in a headlock. Others included a dig at Gerrard, whose backheader led to Uruguay's second goal, and a Scotland fan celebrating wildly with Uruguayans in Sao Paulo. Many have been produced by England fans themselves, proving that even on another dark day for the Three Lions, they still have a sense of humour despite more World Cup disappointment. Here are some of the most popular: . Harsh: Steven Gerrard is depicted as clueless in some virals for heading the ball on to Suarez for his second goal in the crucial group game last night . Royal blue: In this meme the Queen's head was superimposed onto the body of a member of the Uruguay coaching staff, making it look as if Suarez has the monarch in a headlock . Drastic measures: In this viral, the Queen looks to gain revenge on Suarez as she drives her Range Rover while holding a gun with a silencer . Uruguay's superhero: Luis Suarez depicted as Superman after his amazing recovery and display against England, in which he scored twice . Star: Liverpool fans also got in on the act after Suarez's performance, admitting despite England's loss they 'just can't get enough' of the striker . He carried it off: Suarez leaving the field on a stretcher after getting cramp - but only after he had scored twice and beaten England . The King is back: Suarez returned and stuck the boot into England after missing his country's first match when they lost to Costa Rica .

Saint Luis: Suarez confirmed his status as a national icon in Uruguay with his brace against England, with this Tweet making him a religious icon .

"A young British holiday-maker fell to her death from a hotel balcony just hours after arriving at a Spanish resort for a long weekend. Charlotte Faris, 23, checked into a budget hotel in Magaluf on the island of Majorca with a female friend before going out for the night. But after returning in the early hours of Saturday morning, Miss Faris plunged 30ft from a third floor balcony of the hotel, landing head first. Paramedics spent 20 minutes fighting to save her but she was pronounced dead at the scene. Holidaymaker Charlotte Faris, 23, fell to her death from a third-floor hotel room . It is thought she lost her balance and went over the railings of the four-storey building at around 4.30am. Miss Faris is the third Briton to die in a balcony fall in as many weeks on the island. Roofer Benjamin Harper, 28, died on April 20 after falling from the fifth floor of his hotel in Magaluf. His father said he had leaned over a balcony as he smoked a cigarette. And three days earlier Adam Atkinson, 20, died following a fall in the stairwell of his hotel. Witnesses said he had been drinking heavily. The latest tragedy happened at the adults-only Teix Hotel in the heart of the resort’s entertainment district. A guest at the hotel said: ‘Both women looked as if they’d had a drink when they checked in and they looked a little inebriated when they returned a few hours later. ‘They weren’t staggering but you could tell they’d had a few drinks. They went up to their rooms and a few moments later the woman fell from her terrace on to the street running outside the hotel door. Fatal fall: Charlotte Faris, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, had checked in to the three-star Teix Hotel with a female friend only a few hours before she died . Tragedy in paradise: The three deaths have . shocked the community in the resort of Magaluf (pictured), on the . Spanish island of Majorca . ‘Her friend rushed down moments later but there was nothing either of them could do. The pal was totally distraught. It was awful to see. She checked out with her friend’s luggage on Saturday and took an early flight home. She made a statement to investigators before leaving.’ The women had been due to return to Britain today. Miss Faris is a former pupil of Monk’s Walk School in Welwyn Garden City. A family friend  said she wanted to become a police officer. Her mother, Sarah, of Codicote, Hertfordshire, is divorced from her father, Nicholas, who lives in Northampton. They released a statement yesterday, saying: ‘Charlotte was a very loving and much loved daughter, sister, granddaughter and friend. ‘She will be greatly missed by  everyone who knew her. We are still trying to come to terms with our devastating loss.’ Spanish investigators refused to comment yesterday but a source said the tragedy  happened while Miss Faris’s friend was in the bathroom. The Foreign Office last night  confirmed it was providing  consular assistance to the dead  woman’s family.","Charlotte Faris, 23, died just hours after arriving on Spanish island of Majorca for a holiday .

"Wallaby back Kurtley Beale has been fined $45,000 by the Australian Rugby Union (ARU), but has avoided suspension and having his contract terminated following a marathon code of conduct hearing on Friday. The hearing at ARU headquarters in Sydney lasted almost four hours, but it was another two hours before the results were announced. An independent tribunal found Beale guilty of a serious violation of the ARU code of conduct, and imposed the fine for sending an offensive photograph to an ARU employee. Beale admitted to sending the photo on June 9. Scroll down for video . Beale, 25, was also reportedly involved in a verbal altercation with Ms Patston while travelling with the team before the side's loss to Argentina . But, the tribunal ruled evidence did not establish a second more offensive text and photo had been sent by the playmaker. The tribunal found while a serious violation had occurred, mitigating factors were taken into account to determine an appropriate sanction. These included Beale's contrition, the unpleasant consequences the matter had created for the ARU employee and Beale, and the fact Beale had already effectively been suspended from recent matches. ARU CEO Bill Pulver said the tribunal's findings and sanction would be accepted. 'This was a serious allegation and, like any business, when we received that complaint, we were compelled to investigate it and give Kurtley Beale an opportunity to present his case in relation to the matter in an independent forum,' Pulver said. 'We have obligations to our fans and the broader community and we are committed to ensuring any behaviour that has the potential to breach our code of conduct or values is investigated and taken seriously. 'This was deemed a serious violation by the tribunal and, as such, we intend to donate the $45,000 collected through this fine to a suitable organisation that promotes the empowerment of women. Di Patston, left, was copied into a message sent by Kurtley Beale in June and has become subject of an ARU investigation . 'Negotiations regarding Kurtley's contract beyond this year have been on hold in recent weeks. As a result of the independent tribunal's decision, we will re-open those contract discussions.' Rugby Union Players' Association CEO Greg Harris said it was a positive outcome that the tribunal found the more offensive text and photo had not been sent by Beale. 'We are pleased that Kurtley, having shown remorse and incurring the penalty, will now be in a position to continue his rugby career.' Following the decision, Beale apologised for breaching the code of conduct. 'I am satisfied with tonight's outcome. There was conjecture about my contract being terminated, however the tribunal agreed that - on the basis of the evidence - that a fine was appropriate. 'I'm relieved there is no termination and no suspension and I can now continue playing rugby. 'I'm also happy the evidence presented to the tribunal did not establish that I sent the second text and photograph. This is why I fought so hard to prove my innocence regarding that text. 'I'd like to apologise to (former Wallabies business and logistics manager) Di Patston and the broader community for my behaviour, particularly to rugby fans. 'I have had a fair hearing tonight and will work to regain the respect of my teammates, fans and the general Australian community. 'I am extremely proud to represent my country, and I will work hard to ensure my behaviour reflects the honour and privilege of playing for Australia at all times, on and off the field.' The decision means Beale will be eligible for selection for the Wallabies, effective immediately. Kurtley Beale (left) allegedly sent the offensive text messages  in June. A susbsequent row between Beale and Ms Patston led to now-former coach Ewen McKenzie (right) driving the then team business manager to the airport so she could leave the tour early . The emotional anguish felt by a female former Wallabies staffer after she was accidentally sent a crude text message about her by star player Kurtley Bealewas recently ervealed. Di Patston quit her role as the Australian rugby team's business manager  after weeks of controversy following a mid-air row with Beale last month. In the messages, reported in The Daily Telegraph, Ms Patston tells of the hurt she feels at being the subject of the texts and asked Beale why she has been targeted. 'What did I do to you? I have barely known you a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this,' Ms Patston texted to Beale, according to The Daily Telegraph. 'Don't you think my job is hard enough with this?' Beale replied four minutes later, apologising for the message, telling Ms Patston she has done nothing wrong and that he does 'stupid things for no reason'. Ms Patston fires back that she wants the player to leave him alone. The emotional string of texts were exchanged in June while the team were in a Brisbane hotel before the first Test against France. The contents of Beale's offensive text messages about Ms Patston were revealed when a letter from the Australian Rugby Union to Beale was leaked. The letter referenced two messages containing photographs of 'extremely obese women', one with the message 'Di - who wants a go f***ing this?'The Sunday Telegraph reports. Ms Patston contacted Beale after she received the images, telling him, 'I can't stop crying.' 'I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female at this level,' she wrote. 'If I complain then I make it hard for women in rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake. 'Do you realise the situation I am in? Just leave me alone please.' After a further apology from Beale, Ms Patston asked whether he was sorry for sending the message - or for being caught. Around two hours after their  exchange began, Ms Patston and Beale met to discuss the matter in a hotel room with three Wallabies players present. Ms Patston forgave Beale, promising to keep the offending texts secret - but swore she would only keep her silence if no other incidents occurred. After they met, she messaged him to assure him the ARU would not find out about the texts. 'I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter... and how they would feel seeing what you sent me,' Ms Patston wrote to Beale after their meeting. 'I'll never know who you sent them to or why, but everybody deserves a chance.' 'You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).' PATSTON (1:08pm) 'I am sitting here in the team room doing my job and I can't stop crying. What did I do to you? You have barely known me a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this. Don't you think my job is hard enough without this? This is how the only female staff member is treated? I am so embarrassed by this I am leaving for my room I can't stop crying thanks a lot.' BEALE (1.12pm) 'We all see how hard you work for us. I just do stupid things for no reason... I hate that I have done this to you & I am so sorry di.' PATSTON (1.15pm) 'Just leave me alone this is not ok. Do you realise the situation you've put me in? I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female and this level. If I complain then I make it hard for women in Rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake.' After Kurtley Beale and Di Patston met in a Brisbane hotel room . PATSTON (3.44pm) 'Glad we got the chance to catch up and talk it through. I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter (all those things we discussed) and how they would feel seeing what you sent me. I'll never know who you sent them to or why; but everyone deserves a chance. You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).' BEALE (3.48pm) 'I can't believe you're not going to tell Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me & I have learned my lesson I promise you. You have been evry kind to me di and I'll never do anything like this again. Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve better you do so much & work so hard. Wish I could take it back. Thankyou di.' Edited transcripts of text messages . The rugby star promised the then-business manager he would 'never do anything like this again.' 'I can't believe you're not going to Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me,' he replied. 'I have learned my lesson I promise you.' 'Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve so much more.' However, Beale broke that promise when he verbally abused Patston on a flight from South Africa to South America last month, leading to Ms Patston's resignation due to stress. The team was flying to Mendoza after their 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town. Beale is believed to have made a sarcastic comment to Ms Patston when she asked him to change into an item of Wallabies team gear, which sparked a heated exchange.","Kurtley Beale has been fined $45,000 by the Australian Rugby Union .

"A high profile cancer doctor has told how he suspected his mistress of poisoning him but did not tell the authorities  because he 'feared for his life.' George Blumenschein, 50, testified in a Houston Texas court that he doubted that his mistress, Ana Maria Gonzalez Angulo, a fellow cancer doctor was capable of committing the heinous act. ‘I wanted them to find out it wasn't who I thought it was,’ he said in the the 248th District Court at the Harris County Criminal Justice Center in Houston, Texas. Scroll down for video . Disbelief: George Blumenschein, 50, said he could not believe that his mistress, Ana Maria Gonzalez Angulo, a fellow cancer doctor could have committed the heinous act . Trial: Dr. George Blumenschein, right, with his attorney Charley Davidson, makes his way to the 248th District Court at the Harris County Criminal Justice Center Friday, Sept. 19, 2014, in Houston, Texas . Obsessed: Ana Maria Gonzalez-Angulo stands accused of poisoning her ex-lover and co-worker with antifreeze . He also said he was petrified that she would find out that he knew what she was doing whilst he was in a hospital bed. Blumenschein was poisoned in January 2013. He was tasked with helping investigators discover what happened. Gonzalez-Angulo was arrested later and is on trial for assault, accused of poisoning her lover with a sweet tasting chemical found in anti-freeze. The 43-year-old Colombian oncologist faces life in prison if convicted. Blumenschein testified on Friday that he had secretly recorded Gonzalez-Angulo after he got out of the hospital because he feared for his life, according to the Houston Chronicle. He was also fearful of what she might do to his girlfriend Evette Toney. During his testimony, the doctor was forced to reveal intimate details of his affair with Gonzalez-Angulo. Sickening: Traces of the chemical ethylene glycol were found in Blumenschein's system. The chemical is a common ingredient in automotive antifreeze . Fatal attraction: Dr George Blumenschein (left) survived kidney poisoning in January 2013. It is believed Gonzalez-Angulo (right) spiked his coffee with a chemical commonly found in automotive antifreeze . The two met whilst working at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and started a casual sexual relationship in 2011, while Blumenschein was living with his long-term girlfriend Toney. Earlier in the trial, prosecutors argued that Gonzalez-Angulo had a 'fatal attraction' to Blumenschein, and poisoned him when she found out that his girlfriend had suffered a miscarriage. The MD had been living with Toney for years, but said Gonzalez-Angulo started sitting on his lap while the two collaborated at work in March 2011. A few weeks later, she kissed his neck while sitting on his lap. Co-workers: Blumenschein met Gonzalez-Angulo at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Texas where they both worked . Their relationship developed further in the fall of 2011 when they had oral sex on a business trip in Stockholm, Sweden, Blumenschein said. But he said that the two never had intercourse. He said he did not want to cross that line because of his relationship with Toney. ‘It was hard to tell her 'no,' Blumenschein testified: ‘It was hard to tell her 'no as no does not mean no to her.’ The affair lasted for 18 months.. On January 27, 2013, Gonzalez-Angulo invited him over for a light breakfast and ‘special coffee from Colombia,’ Blumenschein said. Hours after drinking the coffee he became ill. He described the feeling like being tipsy. He could barely stand up and had trouble talking. He said that Gonzalez-Angulo joined him for dinner but he could not hold his phone or his utensils. After he stumbled out of the restaurant, his supervisor asked him if had taken the narcotic Oxycotin – but he said he had never done drugs. He said most of the day was a blur and he does not remember much of what happened but he finally drove himself to the hospital as Gonzalez-Angulo followed him. He ended up in a hospital bed after being informed he had been poisoned. Whilst on the stand, he said that he was having a hard time telling his story because he had almost died. However, Gonzalez-Angulo defense team says there is no conclusive proof that the coffee was poisoned, and that the prosecution has dramatized the relationship 'to fit a theory that just doesn't match the facts'.","George Blumenschein, 50, testified in a Texas court that he hoped his mistress Ana Maria Gonzalez Angulo had not poisoned him .

"The teenager raped by a £4.5million lottery winner and benefits cheat yesterday described him as a ‘brazen psychopath’ and said she planned to sue him because of the agony he caused her. The woman – who was 17 when Edward Putman raped her twice after breaking into her home – said she ‘would like to see him penniless’. Putman, now 46, was sentenced to seven years for the 1991 attack, during which his victim was punched so hard she thought her head would ‘cave in’. Victim: Lottery winner Edward Putman's victim said for him to be fabulously rich and living it up was the 'worst kind of karma' after he raped her when she was 17 . Before his conviction, he also tried to intimidate a witness who had seen him in the house into withdrawing their testimony. He declined publicity when he won his huge sum in September 2009 but his identity was revealed when he was taken to court for claiming benefits despite his huge wealth. Putman’s victim, who had previously been involved with him after being introduced by mutual friends, changed her name and fled to another part of the country to avoid ever coming into contact with him again. She told the Mail: ‘He definitely had me in mind when he asked for no publicity [after the Lottery win]. ‘I received £4,000 from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority but that didn’t make up for what happened. ‘It took a year for the case to go to court. Then he made me go through the ordeal of giving evidence. I had to stand there while he stared at me. Shame: Putman, 46, declined publicity after winning £4.5million on the lottery but appeared before St Albans magistrates last week accused of benefits fraud . ‘He is a brazen psychopath who told everyone what he had done when he went to prison. There was no remorse, no shame. ‘I will absolutely be claiming for compensation and will be consulting lawyers. I’d like to see him penniless. It’s not about the money – it’s about the principle.’ The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was living in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, in the early 1990s when she was attacked. She said Putman broke into her home and sat next to her in her living room where he flicked cigarette ash at her, pulled her hair and was abusive towards her before pushing her into a room. ‘He beat the **** out of me. He punched my head so hard I thought it would cave in. Then he raped me,’ she added. ‘Afterwards he sat on the bed and said “Oh my God. I know what I’ve just done”. I patronised him to get him to leave and said, “You’re just drunk. Go home.” He went down the stairs but then came up and did it again.’ The woman, who now has a family and lives in the North East of England, said Putman later persuaded a witness who was in the house to go to the police and withdraw their statement. ‘The police saw his car in the car park. He’s that stupid,’ she added. She said she met Putman through their extended group of friends and on one occasion he took her out in his car. It transpired that at the same time he was stalking his ex-partner, Gail, who last week told the Mail that Putman had concealed his win from her and their son, Sam, 26. Gail, 51, said she had also wanted to claim compensation from Putman, a former bricklayer. Putman was convicted of rape, indecent assault and perverting the course of justice in January 1993 at Northampton Crown Court and served four years of his sentence. He has also been convicted of wounding with intent in a case from the mid-1980s. Friends claim he has appeared in court for other offences including burglary. His rape victim added: ‘He is a crazy and deluded person. He can be quite charismatic – funny and charming. Then he turns... ‘This is the worst kind of karma – for him to be fabulously rich and living it up.’ Putman now lives in a £600,000 detached four-bedroom house in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire. An investigation into his finances is understood to have begun when he tried to buy his former one-bed council flat with cash. Inquiries revealed he had continued claiming housing benefit and income support for 20 months after his lottery win. Home: An investigation into his finances is understood to have begun when he tried to buy his former one-bed council flat with cash. Putman now lives in a £600,000 detached four-bedroom house in Kings Langley, Hertfordshire (pictured) He appeared before St Albans magistrates last Tuesday over the benefits fraud – where details of how he came by his wealth were revealed for the first time – but did not enter a plea after the Crown Prosecution Service admitted they had not worked out exactly how much he owed. The case was adjourned until July 3 when his lawyers said he would plead guilty to two fraud charges and pay back the money.

"This week the Mail serialised intensive care nurse Penny Sartori's new book on Near Death Experiences. The response from readers has been unprecedented, with thousands of you writing in with your own remarkable stories, some of which we published yesterday. Here we share more readers' gripping tales of premonitions and visions. Ghostly visions: Readers say they have seen relatives appear before them at the moment they passed away . Carol Kingston . Carol Kingston, 67, a retired store manager, lives in Milton Keynes with her husband John and has two grown-up children. She says: . It was one o'clock in the morning in May 1982 when the ring of the doorbell woke us up. My husband John went downstairs to answer the door then returned to the bedroom looking miffed, saying nobody was there. For some unknown reason I had a strong sense it was my 25-year-old younger brother Steve. He was in the SAS and based nearby. A few seconds later it rang again and John traipsed back down the stairs. Again, there was nobody there. It buzzed a few more times after that, but we decided to ignore it. At 10am the next morning my father phoned with devastating news. Some officers had arrived to inform him that Steve had been killed in a helicopter crash in the Falklands. At that stage we knew very few details of how he had died but that night my oldest son, Robin, who was then eight, had a dream that his Uncle Steve had risen up out of the water with his arms up and said: 'Don’t worry about me. I'm OK now.' Incredibly, I too had experienced the exact same dream. We later learnt that the helicopter had crashed into the South Atlantic Ocean and Steve had drowned. Juliet Rudkin . Juliet Rudkin, 43, a divorced police officer, lives in Buckinghamshire with her five children: Daniel, 23, Georgina, 19, Andrew, 17, Alex, 13 and David, ten. She says: . In April 2003 I gave birth to a beautiful healthy baby boy who I called David. My then husband Bill and I were over the moon. But when David was just a few months old a horrible, dark feeling crept over me, day and night. I can't explain why but I felt a hideous dread that my son was going to die. I didn't tell anyone because I worried they would think it was postnatal depression, but the feeling persisted. A few months later when my mother, Geraldine, a super-fit 60-year-old, came to my house to take my eldest children to school, I had the strangest experience. As she stood in the hallway waiting to leave I found myself staring at her, unable to look away. She met my gaze and it's hard to explain but it was as though I was looking straight through her eyes and into her soul. She asked me why I was staring at her so strangely and I had to mumble an excuse and look away. After she left, just a few hours later, I received a phone call from Ian, her husband, telling me she had collapsed at home and had been taken to hospital. She died a couple of hours later of a dissecting thoracic aneurysm. I heard myself telling doctors: 'Thank God, I thought it was my baby that was going to die.' Ruth Sheard . Ruth Sheard, 67, a retired mathematics lecturer, lives in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. She says: . I was lying in bed in my home in Wakefield one night in 1991 when I felt a presence in the room. I woke and 'saw' my long dead grandmother Adelaide standing at the foot of my bed. She said: 'The gun fired at this time' and I looked at the bedside clock and noticed it was exactly three o'clock. Then she added: 'It was in the afternoon, not morning. Tell your father.' When I woke the next morning I discovered three small blisters on the outer surface of the bathroom radiator out of which water was seeping. I called a plumber and thought little of it. I visited my 78-year-old father and told him what had happened the night before and his face turned pale. I had always known my grandfather Arthur, his father, had died in the famous naval Battle of Jutland in 1916 but I had failed to recall the date. 'Today is May 31st, 1991,' said my father, his face losing all its colour, 'The 75th anniversary of his death.' Intrigued by my grandmother’s reference to the time, I started to do some research. My grandfather's ship, the Indefatigable, had come under fire from the Germans and after a first volley of three shots hit the deck the ship blew up. The time it happened? Three in the afternoon. When I think of the vision and the number of holes in the radiator, a shiver goes down my spine. Judy Smith . Judy Smith, 66, lives with her husband Alan, in Maldon, Essex. The retired fishmongers have two grown-up children and four grandchildren. She says: . In 1969, when I was 22, I worked in a local branch of a bank in Chelmsford. It was an old building and had a fireplace opposite the tills. It was early afternoon when I looked up and to my great surprise saw my great auntie Lil sitting in a chair 'in' the fireplace. She was looking as she always did, wearing a green dress that I often saw her in and looking content and comfortable. I don’t remember feeling any other emotion other than faint surprise. I wasn't scared but I just thought, 'Oh there's auntie Lil'. She wasn't in solid, human form and I knew somehow I wouldn't be able to touch her. I had worked at the bank for a couple of years already and knew better than to get up from my cashier's desk when I had a queue of people standing in front of me, so I didn't get up. Auntie Lil lived above our family's fishmongers and was still fit and well, despite being in her 80s. I remember she used to pinch our cheeks when she saw us; I was dearly fond of her. I watched my great aunt sitting completely still in the fireplace for a few minutes before she disappeared. She never waved, nor even smiled at me. I just remember her looking in my direction quite serenely. I didn't tell anyone because I was worried they would laugh but minutes later I received a phone call from my mother to tell me Lil had just passed away from old age. I said, 'I know, I have just seen her.' Susan Radwell . Susan Radwell, 60, a psychotherapist, lives with her husband in Oxford. She says: . Because of my job I am used to trying to analyse rationally what goes on in people’s minds. In 1999, however, I had an experience which challenged my view of how the mind works and its capabilities. One night that summer I was lying next to my husband fast asleep at home when at about 2am I was woken by a hand that wasn't my husband’s gently tapping my right shoulder. Sleepily, I opened my eyes and saw Jack, a friend from work, standing in front of me. Days earlier Jack had gone on holiday to Cairo, so I knew it couldn't be him, really. But there he was nonetheless, shimmering, surrounded by a hazy light and wearing a white gown from the neck to the floor. He was smiling at me and looked relaxed and well. By now I was wide awake, my eyes straining to take it all in. I wasn't scared, I just felt reassured and strangely comforted. It's hard to explain, but it was an entirely good, peaceful sensation. He leant forward, gave me a bunch of lilies and left. I calmly fell asleep, not wanting to wake up my husband or share it with him as it had felt like a very personal experience. The next day at lunchtime I got a call from another mutual work friend. She told me Jack had died following a sudden heart attack while on holiday in Cairo. It had happened just hours before he appeared to me. It's hard to explain why he visited me as we had only known each other for three years, and only ever in a work context, but it made me feel more at peace with death. Alan Greaves . Alan Greaves, 62, is a retired senior sales manager who lives in Manchester with his partner Jean, a retired business owner. He has two grown-up sons. He says: . One night in 1983 I woke up having had a nightmare that my neighbour had fallen off my roof and died. I woke up with my heart pounding and my skin covered in sweat, then moments later heard a man's voice that I didn't recognise telling me to lie back down and he would explain the dream. Confused, but keen to find out the meaning, I lay back down and heard the same voice explain slowly and deliberately that it was actually my mother Rachel who was going to die, and that she wasn't going to fall off a roof but give in to illness while surrounded by her family. I asked the voice when, and it said, quite precisely, in three months at 1.30pm. It then told me to go to sleep. I wasn’t scared at all and drifted off straight after. The next day I told my wife Elaine and rang up both my sisters to tell them what I'd heard. Our mother had been ill with Parkinson's disease for four years already but was coping relatively well on her own still. Over the next three months, though, her condition spiralled downhill. The night before the day the dream had told me she would die, I was at her bedside with my three sisters and their husbands and my elder brother. I was crying in the corridor when my brother-in-law put his arm around me. I said it was no good and that I knew she was going to die tomorrow. The next day at 1.15pm her breathing suddenly worsened and she passed away at 1.30pm - the exact time and date that I had predicted three months earlier.

"When former President George W. Bush was a no-show at the s 9/11 Memorial Museum dedication in New York City, some feared the snub was a political statement or a poke at President Barack Obama. But it turns out the Texan had a prior engagement with more than a dozen of America's bravest military heroes. He was in Bentonville, Arkansas on Thursday, receiving the Patriot Award, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society's highest recognition. At each year's awards ceremony, the society brings together living recipients of the Medal of Honor, a separate award given to members of the armed forces 'for acts of gallantry and intrepidity ... above and beyond the call of duty.' Bush posted a photo Thursday night on his Instagram account, showing him posing with 14 living recipients of the honor, including one in a wheelchair. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee emceed the event. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Former President George W. Bush published this photo on his Instagram account, showing how he spent Thursday: with recipients of the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military award, given 'for acts of gallantry and intrepidity ... above and beyond the call of duty' Bloomberg and Obama paused Thursday in front of a New York City Fire Department truck whose cab was sheared off when the Twin Towers collapsed . President Barack Obama honored the nearly 3,000 victims of the September 11 attacks as he dedicated the memorial museum in Lower Manhattan on Thursday . The annual event took place at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art. Bush's father, the forty-first U.S. president, is also a past recipient of the award. Some 9/11 survivors, and family members of victims, were angry when the younger Bush sent his regrets instead of joining other politicians for the opening of the 9/11 museum in Lower Manhattan. Spokesman Freddy Ford told reporters on Wednesday only that a 'scheduling conflict' made the trip impossible. A woman named Marie from Queens, New York called the Rush Limbaugh . show on Thursday, saying she lost her firefighter son on 9/11 and . didn't understand why Bush wouldn't be included in the ceremony. 'He should have been the first person to . speak, or at least his name mentioned,' Marie said. 'I'm very upset. I . lost a son there.' Wal-Mart hosted the day's events in . its home town, including a separate morning appearance by the Medal of . Honor winners at its headquarters. The daytime event was similar to appearances the society arranges nationwide in schools, bringing Medal of Honor recipients face-to-face with young people to tell their stories of selflessness and sacrifice. Bush did not attend the Wal-Mart headwuarters gathering, instead walking around downtown Bentonville, shaking hands with well-wishers and stopping at one point for ice cream. His spokespersons have consistently said he wants to remain out of the spotlight . in his post-presidency, choosing instead to attend a sparse list of private events.. A former senior official in the Bush White House told MailOnline late on Thursday that he has always intended to steer clear of TV cameras and remain practically 'reclusive' as his successors run the federal government. 'His family is in Texas, his friends are in Texas, and his Presidential Library is in Texas,' the former official said. 'And he really doesn't want to invite attention. He's going to wait and let history judge his performance, especially in the months after 9/11.' Living history: Earlier in the day on Thursday, Wal-Mart sponsored a separate gathering of Medal of Honor recipients at its Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters; Bush did not attend that event . President Bush addressed the nation from the Oval Office on the evening of September 11, 2001. Three days later he was pictured speaking to rescue workers at Ground Zero (pictured) Part of history: The megaphone president Bush used is now on display in the museum, which opens to the public on May 21 . Instead, his office issued a statement saying he and Laura 'thank all those who played a role in creating this inspiring tribute, and we send our best wishes to those gathered to dedicate it.' President Barack Obama dedicated the museum in a moving speech after touring the new facility with Bill and Hillary Clinton and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bush's post-presidency has been a quiet one, marked by few public appearances and even fewer interviews. He also declined Obama's invitation in 2011 to attend an event marking the death of al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden. Former first lady Laura Bush said then that her husband thought the commemoration was 'for President Obama to do at this point.' 'He's made the real decision not to enter into politics or the public eye,' Mrs. Bush told The Associated Press then. President Obama awarded the Medal of Honor on Tuesday to Army Sergeant Kyle White, for combat bravery in Afghanistan. White joins 77 other living recipients of the award. Obama greeted Alson Crowther -- whose son Welles saved a dozen people on 9/11 -- and Ling Young, who says she owes her life to Welles . President and Mrs. Obama toured the museum before the ceremony with Bill and Hillary Clinton and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg . Two 'trident'-shaped structural support beams from the original World Trade Center are on display inside the National September 11 Memorial Museum, along with educational exhibits and other recovered wreckage from the site of the deadly Islamist terror attack . Other plans: Bush's spokesman said the former president was invited but couldn't make it due to a scheduling conflict . New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, current New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former New York Governor George Pataki joined the Obamas and Bill and Hillary Clinton in New York on Thursday. The new 9/11 Memorial Museum will open to the public on May 21; on display is the megaphone President Bush used to address rescue crews at Ground Zero on September 14, 2001. Many have praised President Bush's response immediately following the attacks. When the Twin Towers were hit, he was reading to a group of school children in Florida; then-White House Chief of Staff Andy Card paused him to deliver the news that America was under attack. Bush addressed the nation that evening from the Oval Office and was on the scene at ground zero three days later, where he was pictured speaking over with the megaphone to first responders in a now-famous image. His long-term reaction, however, launching America into the war on terror and sending troops into drawn-out wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, dimmed his popularity. The sparse remains of a flag that was raised over the wreckage of Ground Zero during the week following the 9/11 attacks can be seen in the museum . Emotional: Family and friends of the victims, along with survivors, took part in the tearful ceremony that recalled the heroism and tragedy of the day . Bush's full statement read: 'Americans who lived through September 11, 2001, will never forget the horror or the heroism we witnessed that morning. The 9/11 Memorial Museum in New York City will preserve the memory of that day for future generations.' 'It will honor the sacrifice of those who lost their lives and the bravery of those who saved others. And it will help ensure that our nation remembers the lessons of September 11th: that what happens abroad can affect us here at home, that evil is real, and that courage and love triumph over terror and hate.' 'Laura and I thank all those who played a role in creating this inspiring tribute, and we send our best wishes to those gathered to dedicate it.' After Bush declined to appear at Ground Zero for the 2011 bin Laden-related event, Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library director Mark Updegrove said the decision surprised few. 'I think it was for the right reasons,' Updegrove told reporters. 'I think both Bush father and son are very conscious of not detracting the limelight that should be cast on our incumbent president.' The opening of the museum comes after years of fighting between groups over how 9/11 should be portrayed for history, and whether the terror attackers' Muslim faith should play a prominent part in exhibits . Former President Bill Clinton was visibly moved by the ceremony; his administration preceded the 9/11 attacks, but the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 came on his watch . Cards, patches and other mementos of those killed at Ground Zero -- many left at the site's makeshift memorials in the months following the terrorist massacre -- are now on display at the National September 11 Memorial Museum . Never forget: A tribute to the firefighters killed on 9/11 is posted on the 'Final Column' displayed at the museum . Fragments of the fuselage of American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 aircraft that hit the World Trader Center's North tower, are displayed at the National September 11 Memorial Museum; the impact killed all 92 people on board, along with an unknown number on the building's upper floors .","A woman who lost her firefighter son on 9/11 called the Rush Limbaugh radio show on Thursday, angry about Bush's absence from the museum dedication in Lower Manhattan .

"Former Everton and England left-back Ray Wilson's World Cup winner's medal is set to fetch more than £100,000 at auction. The medal, which was awarded after England's 1966 win against West Germany, is inscribed with the words: 'FIFA. World Championship Winners, Jules Rimet Cup, Ray Wilson, In England, 1966'. It is the second time the medal has been put up for sale after it was previously sold for £80,750 in 2002. But it is now expected to go for more than £100,000 when it goes under the hammer on November 11. Ray Wilson's World Cup winner's medal is set to fetch more than £100,000 at auction next month . Ray Wilson, third from right, lifts captain Bobby Moore  in this famous image from July 30, 1966 . Graham Budd, of Graham Budd Auctions, who are listing the sale, said it was an 'increasingly rare opportunity' to acquire a piece of English football history. He said: 'This presents an increasingly rare opportunity to acquire a World Cup winner's medal from England's heroes of 1966. 'Many other examples are now in museums, private collections or highly unlikely ever to be released onto the open market by the player or his family.' England beat West Germany in front of 98,000 at Wembley Stadium to win their first and only World Cup to date. The team included goalkeeper Gordon Banks, midfielder Nobby Stiles, Jack Charlton in defence, captain Bobby Moore and Jimmy Greaves and Geoff Hurst up front. Hurst scored a hat-trick that prompted the famous line from commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme -'They think it's all over, it is now'. Ray Wilson, right, and West Germany's Haller jump for the ball during the World Cup final at Wembley in 1966 . Ray Wilson was in Alf Ramsey's World-Cup winning squad the same year he helped Everton to victory in the FA Cup . Derbyshire-born Ray Wilson's skills as a left-back were first spotted by a scout at Huddersfield Town and Wilson signed professional forms at the Yorkshire club in 1952. Wilson made 266 League appearances for Huddersfield, and had been capped 30 times for England - a record for Huddersfield Town. He moved to Everton in 1964, but a torn muscle meant that he missed most of the 1964-65 season. By comparison 1965-66 proved to be the highlight of his career. He made Alf Ramsey's 1966 England squad after helping Everton to F.A. Cup glory against Sheffield Wednesday in the same year. He played in all six games during England's World Cup winning campaign and the semi-final against Portugal marked Wilson's 50th international cap. At 32, he was also the oldest member of the team that beat West Germany 4-2 in the final on July 30. After the World Cup, Alf Ramsey continued to select Wilson as England progressed through the qualification process for the 1968 European Championships. They went out in the semi-finals and Wilson's 63rd and final England cap came in the third-place play-off against the USSR. At club level, Wilson appeared at another F.A. Cup final in 1968, but this time, Everton lost to West Bromwich Albion. Injuries began to take their toll and he was granted a free transfer by Everton in 1969. After a season at Oldham and another at Bradford City, he retired in 1971 following a brief spell as caretaker manager. Wilson then left the world of football completely and built up a successful undertaker's business in Huddersfield. Wilson, now 79, lives in Slaithwaite near Huddersfield with his wife Pat. They have two children.","Inscription reads: 'FIFA World Championship Winners, Jules Rimet Cup, Ray Wilson, In England, 1966'

"The wardrobe contains a purple tutu, a silky mauve blouse and a floral patterned skirt. The shoes are mostly pastel shades, and a pair of black boots is neatly trimmed in pretty pink. There’s a dolly on the pillow beneath  a Peppa Pig poster and heart- motif wallpaper. It could be any little girl’s bedroom. Yet the five-year-old who sleeps there is a boy. And for more than a year now Zach Avery, his long fair hair done up in bunches, has been insisting on living as a member of the opposite sex. The extraordinary conclusion that he is a girl trapped inside a boy’s body is being backed by medical experts and supported by his school, which has made a lavatory block ‘gender neutral’ to accommodate his needs. 'Zachy' Avery, pictured as he dresses now, was last year officially diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder at the age of four . Zach, at the age of four, before he began growing his hair into the pigtails he now prefers . Cheeky chap: Zach beams in a picture taken shortly before his fourth birthday when he was a 'normal little boy' who liked playing with his Thomas the Tank Engine train set . Zachery Jack Avery is one of the youngest known children to be backed by the  NHS after being diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder. Until shortly before his fourth birthday in December 2010, Zachy, as his mother Theresa calls him, was ‘a normal little boy’. He loved to play with his Thomas the Tank Engine train set alongside his brother Alex. Suddenly, however, he became obsessed with the children’s TV cartoon character Dora the Explorer, and started to dress in girls’ clothes. Mrs Avery, who has two other children, said: ‘He just turned round to me one day and said, “Mummy, I’m a girl”. I assumed he was just going through a phase and left it at that. But then it got serious and he would become upset if anyone referred to him as a boy. He used to cry and try to cut off his willy out of frustration.’ Mrs Avery, 32, and husband Darren, 41, became increasingly worried by their son’s behaviour and took him to a doctor, then to a child psychologist. At the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust in London, which specialises in the disorder, he was diagnosed as having GID. Mrs Avery said: ‘They told us that although he had a male body, his brain was telling him he was a girl.’ Zach (right) with his mother Theresa, father Darren and brother Alex. His family have said he has their full support . At home in Purfleet, Essex, a first-floor flat in a block on a 1980s estate, Mr and Mrs Avery continued to allow Zach to dress in girls’ clothes and play with his sister’s dolls. Meanwhile at Zach’s school, Purfleet Primary, they have applied themselves to what Mrs Avery calls ‘the bathroom issue’ and are hoping Zach can use the staff toilets when he gets older. And the other pupils? ‘We explained to the other kids that Zach’s body was that of a  boy but in his brain he was a girl. We said Zach was just happier being a girl than a boy. They haven’t batted an eyelid. They’ve accepted Zach as Zach and there’s been no problems at the school with bullying. The school has been brilliant and really, really supportive.’ Purfleet Primary, which has 350 pupils up to age 11, was given the lowest ‘inadequate’ rating in December after an Ofsted inspection. Teachers allow Zach to wear a girl’s trouser uniform and black boots with pink trim, which his mother says is female but still neutral. She admits she misses her little boy, but adds: ‘He just wants to be like a little girl. He’s very happy with his long hair, pink-and-red bedroom and a wardrobe full of girls’ clothes. Zach's birth certificate registers him as male - but he has been officially diagnosed with GID . ‘He likes playing with his sister’s old toys but he still loves Doctor Who and playing with his brother. And we still put some neutral clothes in his wardrobe if he ever decides he wants to wear them. We leave it up to him to decide what he wants to do – if he changes his mind and wants to be a boy again then he does, but if he doesn’t, he doesn’t.’ She added: ‘I would love to have my son back, but I want him to be happy. If this is the route he wants to take – if this is what makes him happy – then so be it. I would rather him have my full support. People need to be aware of this condition because it’s very common but even many family-support workers have never heard of cases in children. There are people out there but they don’t want to talk about it.’ On his Facebook page, Darren Avery describes himself as an artist and ‘dad of four starting my own business drawing pictures from photos’. Sketches he has uploaded include a reclining nude woman wearing a necklace with a large, heart-shaped pendant, based on Kate Winslet in Titanic. Others include a blonde girl striking a provocative pose in a figure-hugging top, and a faceless female wearing only a Mickey Mouse T-shirt. Yesterday he and Mrs Avery were negotiating with a tabloid newspaper to sell Zach’s story for a five-figure sum. Figures from the Tavistock and Patman . clinic – the national body for GID – revealed that 165 children have . been diagnosed with the condition this year. A . spokesman said they were unable to comment on individual cases, but . only seven children under five were diagnosed last year – making Zach . one of the youngest. ‘Tavistock Clinic had 97 referrals in 2009/2010; 139 in 2010/2011 and 165 thus far this year. ‘The trend in referrals has been up over the years – this may reflect greater awareness. Zach's mother said he was a 'normal' boy until shortly before his fourth birthday, when he started behaving like a girl . Theresa Avery says Purfleet Primary School has been very supportive over her son's condition, even turning its toilet block gender-neutral . ‘We see children and young people up to the age of 18, from across the UK, who are experiencing difficulties in the development of their gender identity. ‘This includes children who are unhappy with their biological sex. Some may be boys who prefer activities and roles associated with the opposite sex, some may also identify as the opposite sex and vice versa for girls. In general when younger children are referred it is in relation to cross-gender preferences in play, playmates and activities. It is more unusual for children of this age to express cross-gender identification – that is the wish or belief that they belong to the opposite sex. ‘The diagnosis of GID is made by the key workers working with the young person. We will also assess their general well-being. We remain in contact with young people often for many years. ‘Our aim is not to predict or direct the outcome, but rather to support the young person in their general development as well as develop a trusting collaborative therapeutic relationship in which it is possible to openly explore their feelings about their gender.’","Zach Avery, 5, refused to live as a boy when he was just THREE .

"Tom MacArthur, a multi-millionaire former mayor who is battling a prominent tea party challenger for the Republican congressional nomination in a New Jersey district, ran an insurance company accused of cheating disaster victims, MailOnline can reveal. From 2002 until late 2010, MacArthur was chairman of the board of York Risk Services Group, a unit of the global insurer American International Group. He was also the company's president and CEO from 1999 to 2009 and a major shareholder until at least 2006. York boasts on its website that 'We re-price 500,000 medical bills per year and save clients an average of 61% on each bill.' That cost-cutting focus caught up with the company in 2008 after Hurricane Ike devastated the U.S. Gulf coast and a massive wildfire laid waste to hundreds of homes in Sylmar, California. It ended up settling two Ike-related lawsuits and paying a sizable fine to the state of California in connection with allegations of underpaying claims from the fire's victims. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tom MacArthur (L), a former New Jersey Mayor, ran a controversial insurance company sued for low-balling payouts after Hurricane Ike (R) A massive 2008 wildfire consumed most of the Oakridge Mobile home park near Sylmar, Calif. York and another company paid $285,000 to settle claims that they cheated more than 100 homeowners out of portions of their insurance payouts . York isn't a traditional insurer, but its clients are. It helps them save money by carefully vetting and processing their claims. Ritchie Venier, the company's senior vice president, told MailOnline that 'the amount of work we do is determined by what our clients would like us to process on their behalf.' 'However, since we are not an insurance company we do not play the role of one.' York's apparent hand in determining the size of claim payouts, however, has landed it in the same legal hot water as the companies it serves, facing legal accusations along with them of unfairly slow-walking, low-balling or denying claims. MacArthur, the New Jersey congressional candidate, is not named personally in any of the legal actions described in this report, but he was both a York officer and a major shareholder. The Port of Galveston, Texas, which suffered extensive damage following Hurricane Ike in 2008, filed a lawsuit against York and three other insurers. Both the storm and the resulting insurance claims came on MacArthur's watch. And York, along with another AIG unit, paid the state of California a $285,000 settlement . following charges that they violated the state's Fair Claims Settlement . Practice regulations while handling damage claims following a massive . November 14, 2008 fire in the town of Sylmar. That blaze, known in the American West as the Sayre fire, burned more than 11,000 acres of forest and destroyed 600 structures and 480 mobile homes. It also produced hundreds of 'total loss' homeowners claims, including those covering 370 . mobile home policies held by AIG's New Hampshire Insurance Company. The . California Department of Insurance claimed that the two companies had underpaid the devastated homeowners by 10.8 million. York, led by MacArthur, was responsible for processing and evaluating those claims as part of New Hampshire Insurance's outsourcing strategy. The two companies each paid half the penalty, or $142,500, according to court documents. Both denied wrongdoing, but agreed to a settlement in August 2012 to end California's years-long investigation into 125 separate alleged violations of the California Insurance Code. Much of coastal Texas, including Galveston and cities as far inland as Houston, were slammed with flood and wind damage after Hurricane Ike hit in September 2008 . Water everywhere: Insurers paid out $16.2 billion in claims after Hurricane Ike, with another estimated $1.2 billion coming after litigation . The two suits related to Hurricane Ike, the massive 2008 storm that swept through the Gulf Coast and crippled coastal Texas, were settled with undisclosed terms. One, filed by Houston Baptist University, alleged that York low-balled its settlement offer after the hurricane laid waste to its main administration building and student center. Robert Sloan, the school's president, told The campus Collegian newspaper that it would cost more than $21 million to repair and rebuild the structure. But ACE American Insurance Company and York, which evaluated and vetted the claim, offered about $5 million. 'They drug [sic] their feet,' Sloan said in 2010 of the case that began during MacArthur's tenure. 'They . weren’t very responsive. They obviously have not paid us what they owe . us under our coverage. I don’t think the insurance company has acted in . good faith.' Terms of York's 2011 settlement with Houston Baptist University – which came only after MacArthur left – were kept sealed. But on February 22, 2011 Sloan told the school's trustees that he 'went to bed the other night with a big grin on my face, and when I woke up, it was still there.' The university president was happy enough about the size of the checks York and ACE wrote to credit the Almighty with the result. 'This is a testament to the goodness and faithfulness of God,' he said, according to the campus paper. Another . Hurricane Ike legal action involving York came from the Port of . Galveston on the Gulf of Mexico. The Texas harbor was insured for at least $55 . million, with Lexington Insurance Company owing the last $15 million . after other insurers had paid their part. York was the company tasked with evaluating and processing the Galveston claim for Lexington. 'Lexington . owed us the last layer of our insurance, which was $15 million,' Port of . Galveston Director Michael Mierzwa told the Houston-based Guidry News – which reported that the port recovered the entire $15 million in a 2012 settlement without going to trial. The pool of insurers 'had got to $40 million and had stopped paying us; and that’s why we sued them,' he said. The California wildfire turned a thriving community of more than 600 homes into a ghost town, with the California government finding more than $10 million in underpaid insurance settlements . After the fire: Hundreds of homeowners were left with bricks steps and concrete slabs where their prefabricated homes had stood, and the state of California pursued York and another insurance company for allegedly cheating them out of $10.8 million . The Republican National Committee has embraced MacArthur as one of its so-called 'young guns,' suggesting a vigor and fearlessness usually associated with strong retail campaigners. But according to the Newark Star-Ledger, a $2 million cash loan from MacArthur's personal wealth makes up nearly his entire election war chest. He is running a tight race with tea party favorite Steve Lonegan. Both men are former mayors of New Jersey towns. MacArthur's cash-on-hand, though, reportedly dwarfs Lonegan's by a 10-to-1 margin. 'I’m not going to buy a congressional seat,' Lonegan told the Star-Ledger on April 15. 'I could put a lot more money in the race. I’m not going to because you don’t buy your seat. You earn it.' MacArthur has insisted that he is raising money from ordinary New Jerseyans as the June 3 primary election draws near. Russell, his campaign spokesman, emailed MailOnline an aggressive statement, lashing out at Lonegan – who he claimed was responsible for this report. 'Another day, another embarrassment for Steve Lonegan,' Russel wrote, complaining that the tea partier's campaign 'would go to such extreme and underhanded lengths to plant a hatchet job story, and then fail to get their facts straight.' 'Under Tom MacArthur’s leadership, . York handled upwards of one million insurance claims,' Russell added. 'From that, the best Lonegan’s crew could do was find three . cases – all of which were settled after Tom had already left the company . and none of which found wrongdoing by York.' 'Two . of the cases were settled out of court and dismissed, and the third was . a case pressed by an ultra-liberal California Democrat politician that . was also ultimately settled.' Houston Baptist University president Robert Sloan fought York Risk Services Group and its client over unpaid millions to fix a campus building hit by Hurricane Ike, winning an undisclosed  settlement that he attributed to divine intervention . Former Bogota, N.J., Mayor Steve Lonegan, last year's U.S. Senate also-ran, is a tea party favorite who might benefit if revelations about Tom MacArthur's past cause him electoral troubles . Lonegan lost a shot at a U.S. Senate seat last year, falling in a special election to defeat then-Newark mayor Cory Booker. But in that race, he carried the 3rd Congressional District that he now wants to represent in Congress. Three Democrats are vying to face the Republican victor, including lawyers Aimee Belgard and Howard Kleinhendler, and Lyndon Larouche devotee Bruce Todd. The eventual winner in November will replace two-term Rep. Jon Runyan, a former pro football player who is retiring. In a March poll sponsored by PolitickerNJ, Lonegan held a commanding lead with 41 per cent support. MacArthur 'barely moved the needle' with 2 per cent, the political website reported. But that was in a three-way race: Toms River, NJ city councilman Mo HIll withdrew from the race last month and later endorsed MacArthur. Since then, MacArthur has surged forward but it's unclear by how much – or how little. The state's Republican establishment has also coalesced around MacArthur, with GOP parties in both counties straddling the 3rd district endorsing him in late March. His campaign website describes him as 'a self-made businessman running for Congress to be a leader in promoting policies that spur job creation and empower people; that ensure our recovery and renewal in the wake of [Hurricane] Sandy.' MacArthur is quoted on the site saying he believes in a small federal government that, among other things, 'gives a hand up to those in need.'","Tom MacArthur ran York Risk Services Group, a unit of AIG insurance, when the company allegedly skimped on a series of high-risk claims .

"Sir Geoff Hurst nearly quit football four years before he won the World Cup for England - to play cricket. Sir Geoff, 72, was on the verge of hanging up his footie boots to become a wicket-keeper and batsman, he has revealed. He says he loved cricket so much he used to regularly miss pre-season training with West Ham at a young age to bat and bowl. Bat and ball: England World Cup hero Sir Geoff Hurst almost gave up football because of his passion for cricket . 1966: Captain Bobby Moore, carried shoulder high by his team mates, holding aloft the World Cup trophy. England defeated Germany 4-2 in the final, played at London's Wembley Stadium . Sir Geoff, the only man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup Final, says his heroes as a boy weren't footballers - but cricket legends like Denis Compton. He says he was good enough to play for the Essex Second XI and even for the full county - until West Ham boss Ron Greenwood moved him from midfielder to a striker. The star went on to score hundreds of goals including 228 for his club, and key strikes at the World Cup against West Germany and Argentina. Sir Geoff, who now lives in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: 'I was detrimental to both sports playing football and cricket. 'At the top level to be good enough to play the sport you have to be dedicated to doing that thing. 'I enjoyed playing football and cricket and it came to a time in my late teens and early 20s when I say I was ""messing about with both sports"". 'Four years before the 1966 World Cup I was still playing more cricket than football. I thought my future probably lay with cricket' 'It was the end of an era where people like Denis Compton and Willy Watson were playing football and cricket internationally for England. How does that work? 'Playing cricket was to the detriment of my football. I was playing cricket until September, even October each year while it was still light in the evenings. 'Then I was coming back to West Ham having missed all the pre-season training and half-a-dozen league games and I was struggling as a footballer. 'Then Ron Greenwood decided that he would move me from midfield to playing up front. I came back from playing cricket and on the first Monday we played Shrewsbury Reserves. 'I wasn't fit and as I was struggling in the middle of the park then Ron put me up front. We played Liverpool and won 1-0 in my first game up there. 'I came off the pitch and it was like my shorts had been dipped in water because I was that unfit. 'But it worked out and in that first season I played 27 games and scored 14 goals from a standing start. 'Nowadays if you pay £50million and someone gets 14 goals in 27 games it's seen as the best buy you've ever seen. 'I look back on my career and appreciate how quickly and how dramatically it rose, once I decided to fully commit to football. 'Four years before the 1966 World Cup I was still playing more cricket than football. I thought my future probably lay with cricket. 'In 1962 I decided to stay behind while West Ham went on a tour to Africa to play cricket for Essex seconds - that was just four years before the World Cup final . 'There wasn't a decision to choose between the two sports. It's just that the football took off at a senior level quicker than the cricket. 'Had I played more games for Essex in the first team than I did - I played one but never really had more of a chance - I may have ended up choosing cricket. I never officially made that decision. 'The next season I was the top scorer, then in '64 we won the FA Cup, in '65 we won the Cup Winners' Cup and then everyone knows what happened in '66. Sir Geoff Hurst the hat-trick scoring hero of the 1966 World Cup final and the other goal scorer Martin Peters . Sir Geoff also began playing sports with another footballer - Sir Bobby Moore - but rather than football, the first competitive game they took part in was cricket. Luckily for England though, Moore decided much earlier on in life that he would solely focus on football, going on to win the World Cup on that fateful night in 1966. 'Bobby was the best I ever played with,' Hurst said. 'He had such a great football brain and was so determined and focused. 'He was so composed in the big games and big moments. He was able to be as relaxed playing in a World Cup final as he was playing in a five-aside on a Sunday morning. 'His ability to read the game was fantastic. His ability to take on and pass the ball out of defence was excellent. My third goal in the final showed that. 'We played together at football and cricket together for South of England schools but he focused on football from an earlier age than I did.'","Sir Geoff was on the verge of hanging up  boots to become a wicket-keeper .

"Victim: Joseph Griffiths was stabbed to death by a burglar . This is the hardworking grandfather who was stabbed to death by a burglar as he defended his £1million home. Joseph Griffiths, 73, was knifed at least seven times after he went downstairs to investigate a noise. His wife Judith, 72, who is recovering from a hip operation, woke to hear shouts and screams. She went downstairs and found her husband lying in a pool of blood. Paramedics were called but they were unable to save Mr Griffiths. The murder took place on Saturday at around 6am. Yesterday, as police continued their hunt for the killer, friends and neighbours paid tribute to a ‘kind-hearted man’ who had worked hard all his life to provide for his family. One friend said his family are ‘devastated and raw, but trying to carry on as normal’. Neighbour Kieran Donaghey, 23, said: ‘He was a kind man who was devoted to his wife. ‘He was only trying to protect his wife and he has ended up dead. It’s so very sad.’ Mr Griffiths set up his own car repair business near his home in Fulham, West London, in 1994. He continued to work there past retirement age, and employed one of his two sons, Mark, 51, along with grown-up grandchildren. Customer William Broome said: ‘He was a lovely man. He took a real interest in his customers and would remember your job and what you did, which is rare in this day and age.’ Neighbours said they were frightened at the number of burglaries in the Sands End district of Fulham lately. There have been 67 break-ins in the area in the past 12 months. Almudena Mura, 38, who lives several houses from Mr Griffiths’s home, was burgled last December. Hunt for clues: A forensic officer prepares to scour the scene in Fulham, where the body of Joseph Griffith was found on Saturday morning . ‘It is terrible what has happened and it’s scary, especially having had someone break in to my own home. ‘Something woke me in the middle of . the night and I thought it might be my child. But when I went to check, . there was a mess everywhere and I realised I’d been burgled. ‘It’s lucky that I was asleep when . they came or who knows what could have happened.’ Another neighbour, who . did not want to be named, said: ‘I’ve been burgled, so has my . neighbour. It’s definitely worrying.’ Tributes: Flowers have been left outside Mr Griffiths' home . Investigation: A forensic officer examines the boot of a car parked close to the scene . Detective Superintendent Nick . Sedgemore tried to reassure residents yesterday, telling them their area . was not a burglary hotspot. He said: ‘There is not a high volume of burglaries in the ward.’ Last month Jean Farrer, 77, was found dead after reports of a disturbance at her home in Brentford, West London. A man has been charged with  her murder.

"Since age seven, fifth-grader Shyanne Roberts has had one passion - firing guns. Now aged 10 she has become a sensation in competitive shooting tournaments across the United States, using a weapon painted in her favorite colors, purple and black. And despite the perceived dangers, the Franklinville, New Jersey, girl believes: 'Kids and guns don't always mean bad things happen.' Scroll down for video . Young gun: Shyanne Roberts from Franklinville, New Jersey, began competing in local shooting matches aged seven. Now 10, she is taking tournaments across the country by storm . According to CNN, when Shyanne was five, she started to learn gun safety laws. By age six she could recite them off by heart, so her father Dan started taking her to a gun range. It was not until she was seven that she developed the passion and began competing in local matches. She told CNN: 'I want to be an inspiration to other kids and be a leader. It's not a hobby; it's what I want to do!' Her father, who has custody of Shyanne and her younger brother says he is 'very comfortable' with his daughter using a gun, because she has been expertly trained. 'I could have a fully loaded machine gun, and she would not dream of touching it because the curiosity factor has been eliminated,' he added. Shyanne, who now has 20 sponsors backing her in competitions, takes on junior shooters, who are 18 or younger and has even begun entering adult tournaments. Ambitions: At the end of October, she will square off against 200 of the top women shooters at the Brownell's Lady 3-Gun Pro-Am Challenge in Covington, Georgia . Opposition: Shyanne (pictured during her regular target training) who now has 20 sponsors, competes alongside junior shooters, who are 18 or younger and even adults . Last year, she came second in the Women's Division of the New Jersey Ruger Rimfire Challenge. At the end of October, she will go up against 200 of the top women shooters at the Brownell's Lady 3-Gun Pro-Am Challenge in Covington, Georgia. She is the youngest competitive shooter registered at the female-only event where the top performer has a chance to win $5,000, as well as items from a prize table of guns, ammo and more. Her passion aside, she claims to also like playing soccer and hanging out with her friends. But she reiterated that shooting is what she 'really wants to do'. She lives 15 minutes from the shooting range and tries to fit in a 30-minute practice with a pistol, a rifle and a shotgun. But she insists her homework is a priority.

"Luis Suarez's physio postponed his own cancer treatment to ensure the Uruguay striker was fit for his destruction of England. Walter Ferreira, 63, was due to have treatment before the World Cup. His decision to cancel it paid off on Thursday as Suarez’s brace sank England. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Luis Suarez's emotional dressing room message . Tribute: Suarez celebrated his opening goal with Walter Ferreira . Deadly: Suarez almost singlehandedly downed England . Suarez, who rushed over to Ferreira after giving Uruguay a first-half lead, had worked with the physio after knee surgery four weeks ago. Ferreira said:  ‘I am grateful the coaching staff had the confidence to send Luis to work with me.’ Committed to the cause: Ferreira put his own cancer treatment on hold to help Suarez . Suarez paid tribute to Ferreira for getting him fit in time for the crunch clash that sent England heading towards the exit. He said: 'There are people who know how crucial it was for me to have their support. If it wasn't for him (Ferreira) I would not have been here. 'I cried a lot with him, because it was such a hard time, and complicated because of what he was living through as well, he made a sacrifice to remain with me the whole time.'

"Nobody ever laughed at Luis Suarez. Racist abuse isn’t funny. Biting an opponent isn’t funny. Diving and cheating isn’t terribly amusing either. So quite what Suarez meant when he suggested ‘people in England laughed’ about his ‘attitude over the last few years’ is anybody’s guess. All that can be said is that the Uruguay striker was utterly humourless when he spoke to the assembled English media in a corner of the post-match interview area here on Thursday. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Suarez's emotional dressing room message to wife and kids . Revenge mission: Luis Suarez has hit back at his critics after downing England . Payback time: Suarez felt no remorse about sinking his adopted home . He was cold, impassive. Nothing like the man we had just seen kiss his physiotherapist on the head before blubbing in the dug-out. No, after a shower and an encounter with doping control this was now payback time. This was a chance to settle a score by delivering a not-so-polite ‘up yours’ to his adopted home. Which was a pity given how prepared we English were to acknowledge his brilliance. To acknowledge the sheer force of will he displayed in almost singlehandedly destroying England’s hapless defence. We knew he was a world-class talent. It was why he was crowned the best player in the country by both his peers and the Press. But to perform at that level on Thursday only weeks after he was being pushed around in a wheelchair was incredible. Tribute: Suarez celebrated his opening goal with the Uruguay physio who helped get him fit after surgery . It was an achievement that commanded our respect. Sadly that respect does not seem to go both ways and this is not about the English media — which is irrelevant — but about his colleagues at Anfield, the people of Liverpool and beyond. The people who were prepared to forgive and forget and recognise that here was someone who addressed his issues and became a better player, and a better man, as a result. Now, however, you have to question just how genuine he was. In fact, you start to question a number of things he has said in recent months and wonder whether the real Suarez has just resurfaced again. The same Suarez we saw agitating for a move away from Liverpool last year. Who even resorted to questioning the honesty and integrity of his manager, Brendan Rodgers. Only last month he said he was committed to remaining with Liverpool. That he signed his new contract last December because he was now totally committed to the Anfield cause. Deft touch: Suarez headed past Joe Hart to set Uruguay on their way . My best manager . Sven Goran Eriksson. Far from perfect but made three consecutive quarter-finals and masterminded big wins against top opposition. My favourite momentThe 5-1 win in Germany is the most exciting match I’ve witnessed covering England. My favourite player . Rio Ferdinand. There have been more gifted players, but he was a top class centre half — something we’re missing. ‘I signed the contract because I love it here,’ he said. ‘If you’re not happy here you don’t sign any contract.’ Before Liverpool’s players went their separate ways for the summer he also told them he was going nowhere. Steven Gerrard was certainly of the view that Suarez would give Liverpool at least one more season. More worrying for Liverpool is the apparent disregard for the reception he is sure to receive in the Premier League after making his remarks. The suspicion must be that he does not fear the inevitable hostility because he does not intend to return to England. On Friday the Spanish newspapers were dominated by speculation regarding Suarez. The hierarchy at Real Madrid were thought to have been encouraged by Suarez’s post-match comments, sensing there might now be a chance to pounce. Defying the odds: Suarez had surgery on a knee injury just a month ago . In Barcelona it is claimed that a deal is all but done. Whether the Catalans have the financial clout to make such a move remains to be seen. But Mundo Deportivo, the Barcelona sports daily, reported that the club had not only identified Suarez as their top target but said talks are very serious. They wrote of an €85million release clause in Suarez’s contract that would be lowered by €20 million should Real Madrid or Barcelona make a bid. And they salivated over the prospect of Suarez partnering Lionel Messi and Neymar in the most formidable attack in Europe. At the same time, they said Alexis Sanchez might move to Liverpool. The report also highlighted the added attraction for Suarez of having the in-laws round the corner. Apparently his wife’s family live in Castelldefels, a Barcelona suburb where the likes of Messi currently reside. ‘I want to see what they think now,’ was how Suarez signed off his message to those he considers his detractors. Presumably from a safer vantage point, somewhere in Spain.","Uruguay star bagged a brace to send the Three Lions heading for the exit .

"U.S. Army football players lured this year's recruits with alcohol, cheerleaders and a VIP 'party bus', an official report has claimed. Twenty cadets and two coaches at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, were reportedly disciplined after promoting underage drinking and other improper benefits. They allegedly appealed to prospective players by hosting an alcohol-fueled bus trip, using cash from boosters and arranging dinner dates with 'pretty' cheerleaders and female athletes. Disciplined: Twenty cadets and two coaches at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, were reportedly disciplined after  promoting underage drinking. Above, the Army football team in September 2013 . Luring recruits: They allegedly appealed to prospective players by hosting an alcohol-fueled bus trip, using cash from boosters and arranging dinner dates with cheerleaders and female athletes (file picture) During the bus trip, recruits were  driven to a bowling alley with a reputation for overlooking underage drinking, according to the report obtained by The Gazette of Colorado Springs. There, cadets allegedly ordered towers of beer for the recruits to drink, mostly paid for by booster money. Some attendees reportedly downed seven drinks in just 90 minutes. Two military police officers, alongside a number of cheerleaders, allegedly escorted the 'party bus' during the incident in February. The officers were reprimanded following an internal investigation. The shocking revelations were detailed in the report by the academy itself, which was later submitted to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as a recruiting violation. Dinner dates with cheerleaders: The  revelations were detailed in the report by the academy itself, which was later submitted to the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Above, Army cheerleaders during a game . Coach: Despite football coaches, including first-year coach Jeff Monkon (pictured), knowing of the incidents within days, they failed to initially tell West Point leaders or the NCAA, the report said . West Point spokesman Theresa Brinkerhoff, said the academy did not publicly detail the incident at the time because it was handled 'administratively', the New York Daily News reported. The specific punishments for the officers, players and coaches have not been revealed, but no footballers were  dismissed from the Army team, nor were any suspensions announced. Ms Brinkerhoff told the NCAA two members of the football staff had been removed from team activities for a week following the misbehavior, which involved 14 recruits. However, despite football coaches, including first-year coach Jeff Monkon, knowing of the incidents within days, they failed to initially tell West Point leaders or the NCAA, the report said. Star: The football players involved - which include Army starting quarterback Angel Santiago (above, number 3) - are expected to play against the Air Force Academy at West Point's Michie Stadium on November 1 . In a statement, Ms Brinkerhoff, speaking on behalf of the nation's oldest military academy, said that the cadets involved had been dealt with harshly. She told USA Today: 'Although seen as a minor infraction by the NCAA, the U.S. Military Academy takes this very seriously and adjudicated this at the highest level of the disciplinary code. 'We adjudicated this under Article 10 of the Cadet Disciplinary Code and all cadets appeared before the Commandant's Disciplinary Board.' However, the players involved - which include Army starting quarterback Angel Santiago - are expected to play against the Air Force Academy at West Point's Michie Stadium on November 1.","Cadets and two coaches have been disciplined at U.S. Military Academy .

"England manager Roy Hodgson said today that some professional footballers must be gay - but admitted he is yet to meet one. England manager Roy Hodgson said today that some professional footballers must be gay - but admitted he is yet to meet one. The 67-year-old said he was 'naive on the subject' of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) issues in football during a speech at the Cambridge University Union. Hodgson addressed hundreds of students on the issues of leadership, management and his own career. In an interview with student newspaper The Tab before Wednesday night's talk the former Liverpool manager spoke about diversity in the game. Hodgson said he had not met any players who have 'aroused' his 'suspicions'. The manager, who had no idea what LGBT stood for, admitted he was 'naive' to the subject and said it was 'not his world'. He said: 'I haven't come across any players who've found themselves in that position. 'I haven't come across any players who would even arouse my suspicion that they would like to come out but are fearful of doing so. 'It would be unrealistic, I guess, in football to not accept that there are a number of people who are gay because it covers every other walk of life. 'You really are talking to someone who's quite naive on the subject and who has not got strong opinions on it. I don't have an answer for you.' Nottingham Forest and Norwich City striker Justin Fashanu remains the highest profile star to reveal he was gay, but he suffered years of abuse before he killed himself in 1998. More recently the captain of the England women's team Casey Stoney announced she was gay after former Germany and Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger recently came out. The 32-year-old is now having twins with her football-playing girlfriend Megan Harris, who is carrying the babies. Hodgson later told students that he felt out of his depth in the historic university but added: 'I'm not stupid, I read books and everything.' Loss: Nottingham Forest and Norwich striker John Fashanu (left) came out as gay but suffered so much abuse he killed himself in 1998. Former West Ham player Thomas Hitzlsperger, right, admitted he was gay in January . After the talk student Will Nott said: 'He's an interesting and surprisingly funny guy, although some of his comments did make him appear a bit out-dated.' The Cambridge Union Society, founded in 1815, is famed for inviting international politicians and academics to its regular debating sessions. Previous speakers include the Dalai Lama, Winston Churchill, Ronald Reagan and actors Sir Ian McKellen and Clint Eastwood. Hodgson dismissed his own playing days as 'not worth mentioning' and said the English media was not interested in his early successes as a manager in Sweden. The manager, who had no idea what LGBT stood for, admitted he was 'naive' to the subject and said it was 'not his world' Hodgson told the students: 'It would be unrealistic, I guess, in football to not accept that there are a number of people who are gay because it covers every other walk of life' He described his spell in charge of United Arab Emirates as a 'a waste of time'. The Arsenal defender Casey Stone said she has never hidden her sexuality in football circles because it is 'accepted'. She told BBC Sport: 'I feel it's really important for me to speak out as a gay player because there are so many young people struggling with being gay'. 'You hear about people taking their own lives because they're homosexual, now that should never happen. They should never feel those pressures. 'How can I expect other people to come out and speak about themselves if I'm not willing to do that myself? German football star Thomas Hitzlsperger said diver Tom Daley's acknowledgement that he was in a same-sex relationship helped him to come out publicly as gay in January. The England Women's football captain Casey Stone is openly gay and Welsh rugby player Gareth Thomas, who publically announced he was gay in 2009 . The 32-year-old German international midfielder yesterday became the first Premier League star to reveal he was homosexual, saying that he had recently accepted that he 'preferred men'. Hitzlsperger, who ended his playing career in September due to persistent injuries, said that other sportsmen's revelations about their sexual orientation, including those of Tom Daley, had made him feel that he was not alone. The former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton player said he had also felt empowered by Welsh rugby player Gareth Thomas, who publically announced he was gay in 2009, and John Amaechi, who became the first NBA (National Basketball Association) player to speak out about his homosexuality. Hitzlsperger said that he was also encouraged by former Leeds United and US winger Robbie Rogers announced he was gay last year, and hoped that he too might be able to encourage other footballers to do the same. 'I read about John Amaechi, Gareth Thomas and Tom Daley,' Hitzlsperger told The Guardian newspaper. 'They weren't footballers but the fact that they went public gave me the feeling that I was not alone. I began to think that I could help other footballers who might be in the same shoes, so that they could see that here's someone who was even an international.'","The 67-year-old was speaking to students at Cambridge University .

"Whether I’m glammed up for a night out or sitting at home on the sofa, I wouldn’t dream of going without lipstick. The reason? My natural lip colour is very pale and without a touch of lippy I look positively cadaverous. For this reason I have worn lipstick or gloss every day since I was 13. This vanity costs me a small fortune — almost £50 — as I get through two or three products every month. I’m always on the lookout for the holy grail of lipsticks, one which goes on and jolly well stays put. So, when I heard about the new Rouge Edition Velvet by Bourjois and the company’s claim that it lasts for a full day without smudging off, I could hardly contain myself. Can this be true? The boffins at Bourjois may have tested it scientifically, but I decided to put it, and five competitors, to a rather more practical test. Each lipstick was subjected to the rigours of me eating a sandwich, drinking a glass of wine and . . . kissing my husband. Here’s how they fared. Scroll down for video . The smooch test: Alice (wearing Rouge Edition Velvet in Frambourjois by Bourjois) with her husband Justin . STICKING AROUND . Rouge Edition Velvet in Frambourjois by Bourjois, £8.99 boots.com . APPLICATION: This reminds me a little of a felt tip pen. You need a steady hand, but the result is smooth and even. It has a matte finish though the texture leaves my lips feeling a bit dry. The colour is a vivid pink — much brighter than I would normally use — but I rather like it, especially now that I have a bit of a tan. THE TEST: I made some sandwiches with sliced white bread to show up any lipstick that comes off — not hugely classy perhaps, but effective. As I bite into a smoked salmon triangle, a half-moon shaped stain instantly appears. I lick my lips. Whoops, there’s another bit of lipstick gone. But when I look in the mirror, my lips are as bright pink as when I started. Feeling rather perky, I take a sip of prosecco, which leaves a glowing crescent on the glass. Next, I haul Mr Smellie out of his study for a (reasonably) passionate kiss. You’d think he would be thrilled at a bit of affection from his wife, but he seems more concerned with returning to his computer. Afterwards my lips are still bright pink, which is impressive, but so are my husband’s. He rubs at his mouth in disgust with the back of his hand. VERDICT: A great deal has come off, yet my lips still look great. The colour certainly holds. Mr Smellie may just have to get used to it. SCORE: 7/10 . Lipstick left behind: The Bourjois lipstick leaves it's mark on Justin, but overall Alice is impressed . NO STAYING POWER . George Matte Lipstick in Luscious at Asda, £4 . APPLICATION: This is a pleasant, glossy light pink and feels expensive and moisturising as I carefully draw it around my lips. The result is a demure rose colour. I look as though I am going to a summer garden party. THE TEST: There is a pretty pink rim on the bread after my first bite of sandwich, and as I sip from my glass a bright mark instantly appears on the side of the glass. I suppose if I were actually at a summer garden party at least I wouldn’t lose my drink. A smooch with Mr Smellie leaves me looking like a clown. I gather, from his under-the-breath mutterings, that he is less than impressed with this one which comes off as easily as it went on. VERDICT: A lovely lipstick, but there’s little left on my mouth and too much all around it. SCORE: 4/10 . SMOOCH-PROOF . Ruby Woo by Mac, £15.50, debenhams.com . APPLICATION: Debenhams tell me their best-selling lipstick this year is Mac’s Ruby Woo — almost 4,000 units have flown off the shelves after Vogue declared that it is: ‘extra matt, red, lasts all night long’. It feels very dry on my mouth but the final effect is an even and bright red. THE TEST: When I take a bite of my sandwich there is barely a mark left on the white bread. I have to peer at the edges in bright daylight to see even a smidgen of smudge. It’s the same with my wine glass — a mere whisper of pigment is left behind. After a quick smooch with my husband (if I’m honest, they’re getting less enthusiastic) there is barely a hint of red on him and my lips still look fantastic. VERDICT: There’s a little staining around my mouth, but my lips remain bright red. Impressive. SCORE: 8/10 . Sandwich a la Lipstick: Alice (wearing Lip Lacquer in Dangerous Lips by Gosh) makes a mark on her lunch . VAMPING IT UP . Lip Lacquer in Dangerous Lips by Gosh, £3.99, superdrug.com . APPLICATION: This is a magnificent and intensely coloured lip gloss with a rich and creamy texture. The bottle is squat and looks as though it contains nail varnish rather than lip gloss. The short sponge applicator makes it easy to apply and the gloss smells delicious. A deep colour and gorgeous, glamorous high-shine finish. THE TEST: I’m afraid this makes a bit of a mess. There is a semi-circle of scarlet on the sandwich and you could pick out my glass from across a room, such is the brilliance of the hue after just one sip. They both look as though I might be bleeding. My husband appears to have been in a fight, rather than a loving embrace with his wife. And I resemble a vampire who’s just feasted on a victim. VERDICT: It looks great at the start, but it comes off super quickly — and the result ain’t pretty. SCORE: 2/10 . Red or white? Though Alice likes the Gosh lipstick's colour, it comes off 'super quickly', and it ain't pretty . PERSISTENT POUT . Semi-permanent Lipstain Pen by Stargazer in No6, £4, stargazer-products.com . APPLICATION: This looks like a neon marker. I feel as though I am drawing on my mouth rather than applying lipstick. Once on, I look a bit muttony — this colour is too bright for anyone over 25. THE TEST: They claim this lasts 24 hours, and indeed it is quite extraordinary. No marks are left on the bread, glass or husband. When I pick the children up from school (looking as though I’m off clubbing, such is the glow-in-the-dark quality of my lips) I also test it on them. They loathe lipstickey kisses, but this doesn’t leave a trace on them either. Even when I vigourously rub my mouth with the back of my hand, there’s just a light orange stain. It takes five minutes’ elbow grease and three make-up removal wipes to get it off. VERDICT: Impressive and certainly does what it says on the tin. In fact, it lasts longer than 24 hours. I draw some on my hand on friday night and it’s still there on Sunday morning, in spite of my having, obviously, washed a few times in the interim. SCORE: 9/10 . MAKE YOUR MARK . Rouge Prodige True-hold Colour and Shine Lipstick in Mystic Plum by Clarins, £19, John Lewis . APPLICATION: It smoothes on evenly and the lipstick’s thick, creamy texture gives my mouth a misleadingly youthful plumpness. I look elegant and sophisticated. This is by far my favourite colour. THE TEST: As I bite into my sandwich, I can feel the lipstick coming off on the bread, as though I am using it to blot my mouth and a light plum shadow is left behind. It’s the same on the glass — there is a faint imprint of my lips. I’m afraid that some also came off onto my husband. He wandered off to walk the dog with a purple smudge on his left cheek. VERDICT: There is little lipstick left but my lips feel wonderfully moisturised and I don’t mind reapplying in the least.

"The retrial of a Polo millionaire for DUI manslaughter has been put at risk after a juror snuck a laptop into his hotel room to apparently check on his Fantasy Football team. John Goodman, 51, was sentenced to 16 years in prison in May 2012 after being convicted of killing 23-year-old Scott Wilson in a drunken hit-and-run in Wellington, Florida, in February 2010. But a retrial is currently underway after the tycoon's initial conviction was thrown out when a mistrial was declared because of juror misconduct. Now, another juror - Juror No. 3 - has thrown the retrial into doubt after violating a rule against unsupervised computer use by sneaking a laptop into his West Palm Beach hotel room. Scroll down for video . Accused: The retrial of Polo mogul John Goodman (pictured) - who is accused of DUI manslaughter - has been put at risk after a juror snuck a laptop into his room to apparently check on his Fantasy Football team . Keeping up with his team: The juror - dubbed Juror No. 3 - claims he only used the laptop to access Bleacherreport.com and Fantasy Football at Yahoo.com (pictured) to check on football scores . The jurors - who are all being sequestrated at the hotel in a bid to stop them finding out this is Goodman's second trial - are only permitted to use the internet under the watch of deputies. They are also forced to log in and out of their iPads, tablets and other devices - which are only allowed in a specific lounge area at the venue - and do not have access to television. But despite the strict restrictions, Juror No 3 somehow took his laptop into his private room on Sunday afternoon and searched the web, according to The Sun Sentinal. He was caught when he refused to provide his laptop password to a Sheriff's Office supervisor, prompting the suspicious official to allow a deputy to check the device's usage history. Alleged manslaughter: Goodman (left), 51, was sentenced to 16 years in prison in May 2012 after being convicted of killing Scott Wilson (right), 23, in a drunken hit-and-run in Wellington, Florida, in 2010 . Wrecked: But a retrial is currently underway after the tycoon's initial conviction was thrown out. In the retrial, the jurors will not see the $200,000 Bentley (pictured) that Goodman was driving at the time of the crash . Crumpled: They will also not see the Hyundai (pictured)  that Mr Wilson, an engineering graduate, was travelling in when he was struck by Goodman's vehicle. The student then plunged into a canal and drowned . During questioning, the juror claimed he only used the laptop to access Bleacherreport.com and Fantasy Football at Yahoo.com to check football scores, ABC News reported. 'No news sites whatsoever,' the man told the court. 'I have not been compromised at all.' However, Judge Jeffrey Colbath, who found out about the incident via text message at 5am yesterday, expressed concern about the juror's claims. Concern: Judge Jeffrey Colbath (pictured) has expressed concern about the juror's claims that he only used his laptop to check football scores . 'It may be that he’s being disingenuous when he says ""The computer just magically appeared in my room"",' he told the court. 'It flies in the face of their procedures... of common sense... He's not following the court's instructions.' Despite Juror No. 3's violation and Judge Colbath's concern, the prosecution and defense are allowing the juror to continue on the case. The judge agreed there was time to revisit the incident before the jury - which was selected in Tampa - begins deliberating over a verdict. It comes just a day after it was revealed that the jurors will not be shown the $200,000 Bentley that Goodman was driving when he allegedly ran a stop sign and smashed into Mr Wilson's car at speed. sending it into a canal. They will also not see the Hyundai that the engineering graduate was travelling in when he plummeted into the water and drowned, according to ABC News. This is because officials ordered the release of the two vehicles after Goodman, the founder of the International Polo Club Palm Beach, was convicted in his first trial. The cars were crushed. Earlier this week, Palm Beach Homicide Detective Troy Snelgrove told the new jury that Goodman appeared inebriated with watery eyes and slurred speech in the hours after the fatal crash. At the time, the millionaire's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 percent, more than twice the legal driving limit, and he smelt strongly of the substance, he said. Yesterday, Facundo Paredes, the valet at the bar where Goodman had been drinking before the crash, said the businessman did not seem impaired when he handed him the keys. Giving evidence: Yesterday, Facundo Paredes (pictured), the valet at the bar where Goodman had been drinking before the crash, said the businessman did not seem impaired when he handed him the keys . Surveying the damage: Goodman observes his wrecked Bentley following the crash that killed Mr Wilson . However, forensic toxicologist Dustin Tate Yeatman said it was still possible Goodman was intoxicated at the time. 'Someone who drinks alcohol on a daily basis could potentially have a significant tolerance,' he told the court on the eighth day of the retrail. Last week, a local bartender  testified that Goodman bought 18 drinks before the crash, including tequila shots and a vodka drink, but said he shared them between friends. Evidence presented in court showed that the mogul's bill at the venue came to around $272. On trial: Earlier this week, Palm Beach Homicide Detective Troy Snelgrove told the new jury that Goodman (seen, left, in court) appeared inebriated with watery eyes and slurred speech in the hours after the crash . Tragic: Goodman said he left the scene because he was not aware he had hit the University of Central Florida graduate (pictured with his mother), who was driving home to Wellington to visit his family at the time . However, Goodman's lawyers claimed that he was not driving while drunk, but instead had a drink following the incident to calm his nerves. Speaking in the first trial, Goodman also said his brakes had malfunctioned before the crash. 'I began to apply my brakes, and the car did not seem to be stopping as easily as I was used to,' he said. He added that he left the scene because he was not aware he had hit the University of Central Florida graduate, who was driving home to Wellington to visit his family at the time. He told the court that if he had known, he 'would have done whatever I could have done to help'. Couple: In  March 2012, Goodman tried to adopt his girlfriend Heather Hutchins. Above, the couple together . In a stunning move in March 2012, Goodman tried to adopt his girlfriend Heather Hutchins, 44, which would have entitled her to a large amount of his children's $300million trust fund. The adoption papers stated that Ms Hutchins, who has been dating the millionaire since 2009, was entitled to at least a third of his trust, according to the Palm Beach Post. At the time, Wilsons' attorney, Scott Smith, said Goodman was attempting to use the adoption to shield his assets. A Miami appeals court later ruled that the businessman could not adopt Ms Hutchins. Lap of luxury: The International Polo Club, which Goodman founded, attracts a range of A-list celebrities . Goodman's appeal for a retrial was granted after juror Dennis DeMartin, 69, was found guilty of misconduct after not disclosing his ex-wife's DUI during jury selection. 'A juror who deceives to get on a jury in a high profile case for his own profit is a trial lawyer's worst nightmare,' Goodman's attorney Roy Black wrote in a statement at the time. If Goodman is convicted again of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide, he faces 16 years in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.","Tycoon John Goodman, 51, convicted of DUI manslaughter in May 2012 .

"Tasteless photos of tourists doing handstands between and skipping upon the gigantic stones of Berlin’s Holocaust Memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe have been condemned in Germany. Social media sites such as Facebook have been flooded in recent weeks with pictures of young visitors frolicking among the giant maze of stones constructed to remember the six million Jewish victims of the Nazi extermination programme in the Second World War. One picture even shows an Asian girl behind two friends giving the middle finger to the camera inside the memorial. Scroll down for video . Social media sites have been flooded . with pictures of visitors posing on the giant stones at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial - a site constructed in memory of six . million Jewish victims who died at the hands of the Nazi regime . This visitor at the memorial site posed for a photo by jumping off the stones and then using the hashtags '#happy' '#girl' '#weeeee'. She even put an smiley-style emoticon at the end of her post . This visitor to Auschwitz - where 1.1million Jews were killed - posed . with her thumbs up for a photo, while using the caption 'Thumbs up if . you're chilly willy' Another trend sweeping social media sites is to pose at the gate of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp using the hashtag #arbeitmachtfrei - a phrase . used by the Nazi regime which means 'work sets you free' There has also been a spike in photos of tourists larking about at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial outside of Berlin. Some 200,000 people were deported to Sachsenhausen before and during the war and 30,000 were murdered there, many in cruel medical experiments. A favourite snapshot posted on the Internet seems to be of youngsters hanging off the steel gate that bears the cruel lie of the Nazi Regime ‘Arbeit Macht Frei’, which means 'work sets you free'. One young woman received 20 ‘likes’ of the photo of herself at the infamous gate when she posted it on Facebook. 'These snapshots really are shameful,' said the best selling newspaper BILD in a commentary on the disturbing new trend. 'The gate of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp has a particularly tragic notoriety - good enough reason not to hang off of it. Why are these people showing no respect at all for the dead?' This tourist posted a photo of herself jumping between the stones of the Berlin memorial, using the hashtag '#goodtimes'.

These two girls posted a picture saying 'Being sad at the holocaust memorial' before posing with 'sad' faces . Dr Horst Seferens, in charge of the Sachsenhausen site which is now a memorial museum to its victims, said: 'Sometimes schoolchildren are overwhelmed with what they see and lark about or simply burst out laughing. Then the staff have to intervene to restore calm.' Police are continually having to reprimand people at the Holocaust Memorial near Berlin’s famous Brandenburg Gate for jumping between the stones, picnicking on them and sometimes even urinating inside the maze built to symbolize the feelings of loss and bewilderment the Jews of the time felt when the Nazis came for them. This boy got 85 likes when he posed against one of the stones at the memorial in Berlin . These two girls squeezed between the stones to share a snap of the memorial with their friends . An estimated 10,000 photos of young people larking around at the site are now posted on the Internet - to the dismay of the Memorial Foundation for the Murdered Jews of Europe which administers the site.

"The blood of thousands on his hands, SS General Hans Kammler killed himself in 1945 in the dying days of Hitler’s Germany. That, at least, was his official fate. The man steeped in the horrors of the death camps had met his just deserts. However, it is now claimed that Kammler survived the war, spirited away to America and given a new identity by the US authorities. S.S. general Hans Kammler (left and right), who was said to have killed himself at the end of the war, may have escaped to America in order to pass on the Nazis' secret weapons programme, claims a new documentary . Weapons programme: The German V2 rocket was the ancestor of Cold War missiles which were still to come . For the general wasn’t just an expert in the technicalities of industrial scale slavery and slaughter, he was also deeply involved in the Nazis’ secret weapons programme. The Americans, according to a TV documentary, were determined to have his know-how and not let him fall into the hands of the Russians. Both the US and the Soviet Union tried to recruit Hitler’s scientists after the war to help with their own space and military programmes.  But it is claimed that Kammler’s record was so monstrous that his death had to be faked and he had to have a new identity. ‘The whole history of suicide is staged,’ said Berlin historian Rainer Karlsch. ‘There are several documents that clearly demonstrate that Kammler was captured by the Americans.’ Another expert, Matthias Uhl of the German Historical Institute in Moscow, said: ‘The reports from America are more credible than those given about the alleged suicide by Kammler’s associates.’ Born in 1901, by the end of the Second World War Kammler was almost as powerful as SS Chief Heinrich Himmler and armaments Minister Albert Speer. He had access to the Nazi’s most advanced technology including the ‘weapons of retaliation’ – the V1 and V2 rockets that caused death and destruction in Britain, but came too late to turn the tide of the conflict. Kammler designed and built the crematoria at Auschwitz which incinerated most of the bodies of the estimated 1.2 million people murdered at the camp in Nazi-occupied Poland . Kammler was also responsible for the construction of the so-called 'weapons of retaliation' - the V-1s and V-2s that caused tremendous death and destruction in Britain, but which came too late to turn the tide of the conflict in Germany's favour. Pictured, left, are soldiers of the US Army at Bomskirchen, Germany, inspecting a captured V-2 bomb and, right, a German V-2 rocket taking off . He was also involved in the construction of death camps, including the design of the crematoria at Auschwitz which incinerated most of the bodies of the estimated 1.2million people murdered at the camp in occupied Poland. The history books say that, one day after the Third Reich surrendered on May 9, 1945, he either shot himself or took poison in the former German city of Stettin, now Szcecin in Poland. His body was never found. ‘This whole story of suicide was staged by two of his closest aides who were committed to him,’ Karlsch tells ZDF TV in Germany. At the war’s end America, while taking part in the punishment of many top Nazis at the Nuremberg trials, also launched the covert Operation Paperclip – the secret exit of top Nazi scientists. ZDF says in the documentary: ‘Sources say that Kammler was captured by the Americans and interrogated by the US Counterintelligence CIC. The secret service man responsible was Donald Richardson, a personal confidant of allied supreme commander General Dwight D Eisenhower.’ Police officers call for stretchers amid the damage cause by a V-2 bomb attack on Smithfield, London . The sons of the secret service man told programme makers that their father was in charge of the German weapons expert after 1945. One of them, John Richardson, said: ‘This engineer brought a special treasure from the Third Reich into the United States. He offered modern weapons for us. ‘It was put to my father that he should bring this “useful” German into the United States to prevent him from falling into the hands of the Russian intelligence service.’ It is not revealed under what name Kammler lived or when he died, though some archival material speaks of a ‘special guest’ living under Richardson’s wing.","S.S. general Hans Kammler was head of construction and defence projects .

"A dead bobcat was cruelly hanged from a Tennessee high school's goalpost on Tuesday just days before a football game with a rival school. Students at Tullahoma High School, whose team is called the Wildcats, made the horrific discovery on Tuesday morning and notified a teacher who called Animal Control. The director of schools from the county, Dan Lawson, said that police were informed and animal control removed the cat from the school's field. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGE . Hanged: A dead bobcat was mysteriously hanged from a goalpost at a Tullahoma High School in Tennessee . The Tullahoma High School Wildcats are scheduled to play Coffee County Central's (CHS) Red Raiders on Friday night and the macabre prank may be related to the school's heated rivalry, reported The Manchester Times. 'This isn’t what a rivalry is about and this is not what our school and our community are about, 'said CHS principal Dr. Joey Vaughn on Wednesday morning. 'This isn’t rivalry. This is mean. This is wrong and hateful. This does not represent our student body as a whole. We have great kids at our school and Tullahoma has great kids at its school.' Vaughn said he doesn't know who committed the act of animal cruelty but that there is an ongoing investigation to find the culprit. Bobcat hunting season doesn't begin in the area until November 21 and that it's unclear how the animal died. 'That is not a good way to treat a critter for a prank, that’s for sure,' said Doug Markham, from the Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency (TWRA). Rival schools: The Tullahoma High School (pictured) Wildcats got a gruesome surprise  when they discovered a dead bobcat hanged from one of their goalposts just days before a game with the rival school . 'If we found out who it was and he or she killed it out of season they could be charged with hunting in closed season and they could face fines and court costs. They could lose their hunting license,' explained Markham. Despite the hateful incident, the game has not been cancelled between the rival schools. 'There have been various events throughout these years, but this week someone took a high school rivalry and took it too far. The actions of a few do not represent this community as a whole. At this time we do not know who committed this callous act or what their involvement with the rivalry is, but there is no place in our community or this world for these types of actions,' said Vaughn in a statement. Coffee County Director of Schools Dr. LaDonna McFall also contributed to the heated discussion. 'Rivalries are good but this isn’t healthy,’ said McFall. ‘We can behave better than this.

"As far as his closest aides were aware, he kept to a strict healthy diet and drank only lukewarm water. But Adolf Hitler would regularly stave off attacks of midnight munchies by tucking into specially made ‘Fuhrer Cake’ and other gooey treats. He would raid the kitchen after staying up late talking to guests and rarely get up before 2pm, according to a maid who worked at his mountain retreat in Bavaria. Sweet tooth: Adolf Hitler, pictured dining at the Berghof with a friend, loved cakes, his former maid reveals . Elisabeth Kalhammer has broken her silence after 71 years to reveal what life was like at the Berghof when the Nazi dictator was in residence. Mrs Kalhammer, 89, says that Hitler’s mistress Eva Braun – whom staff greeted with a ‘Heil M’lady’ – ran the house. All the maids knew Hitler had trouble with his spleen and kept to a strict diet devised by a personal cook. But the famously sweet-toothed dictator secretly feasted on chocolate biscuits and cream scones, Mrs Kalhammer says. A ‘Fuhrer Cake’ – an apple cake strewn with nuts and raisins – had to be baked each day and left out every night for him to raid like a naughty schoolboy as the rest of the household slept. ‘He loved sweet things,’ she said, ‘and Eva Braun was our best friend.’ Elisabeth Kahlammer, 89, has opened up about the dictator 71 years after she answered an advert to be his maid . Secrets: She worked with 22 other girls at his Bavarian lair, which she says was run by his mistress Eva Braun . Austrian Mrs Kalhammer – then Elisabeth Marchtrenkerin – went to work at the Fuhrer’s retreat near  Berchtesgaden in 1943 after answering an advert in her local paper: ‘Maid wanted. Location: The Berghof on the Obersalzberg.’ She did not know that her employer would be Hitler. Her mother had asked her not to take the job but the teenage Elisabeth felt she could not turn it down and the Reich’s employment office told her she should be grateful for the work. He loved sweet things. And Eva Braun was our best friend . ‘I felt queasy when I arrived,’ Mrs Kalhammer told the Salzburger Nachrichten newspaper. On her first day she passed through three SS guard posts. ‘The house was full of guests and the Fuhrer was just suddenly there,’ she said. She soon realised that ‘I was allowed to think but not to speak’ while in his presence, nor was she or the others to gossip about him – although naturally they did. From the beginning, Elisabeth was warned that anyone revealing details about the Berghof would face strict punishment. She was one of 22 girls in service and was often in Hitler’s  presence although she never talked to him – he allowed only long-serving staff to approach him and to enter his private rooms. She worked in the laundry and sewing . rooms, did the cleaning and made the tea which Hitler liked to drink . from a Nymphenburg porcelain cup. Mrs Kalhammer worked at the retreat from 1943 until they were evacuated in 1945. She worked in the laundry and sewing rooms, and made tea which Hitler liked to drink from a Nymphenburg porcelain cup . Once she broke a cup and was punished by losing several of her days off. Conditions at the Berghof were in stark contrast to those faced by ordinary Germans and Austrians. While Elisabeth’s family  had little to eat, the maids  enjoyed freshly pressed apple juice and had plenty of food. She said Eva Braun ‘was always good to me. She behaved like the lady of the house, even though she was not married. She designed our uniforms. For Christmas she presented me with wool, to knit socks for the men on the front.’ Hitler was obsessed with movies and had a private cinema at the Berghof. The maids were allowed to use the cinema when a propaganda film starring actress Marika Roekk was shown. Braun was ‘spellbound’ by Roekk, she said. But the mood changed in July 1944, following a failed assassination attempt against Hitler by army officers. Elisabeth worked on at the Berghof until almost to the end of the war, when it was evacuated and bombed in an Allied air raid.","Elisabeth Kalhammer, 89, responded to newspaper advert in 1943 .

"Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, who hid a £1bn trove of suspected stolen Nazi art has died in his Munich flat . A museum in Switzerland today said it . has been named the 'unrestricted and unfettered sole heir' of reclusive . art collector Cornelius Gurlitt. The . 81-year-old son of Adolf Hitler's art dealer, whose collection included . many pieces looted by the Nazis, had made a will shortly before his . death yesterday. There had already been speculation that the beneficiary was a museum outside of Germany, possibly in Austria or Switzerland. But . now the Kunstmuseum Bern has announced it is 'surprised and delighted' to have learned that Mr Gurlitt's remaining paintings will be left to . its collection. In a . statement it said the appointment brings “a considerable burden of . responsibility and a wealth of questions of the most difficult and . sensitive kind, and questions in particular of a legal and ethical . nature.” The museum says it never previously had any dealings with Gurlitt. Mr . Gurlitt died in the Munich flat where he kept many of the paintings, . which included works by Renoir, Matisse and Picasso that were either . looted or bought from Jews at knock-down prices. He . had been selling them over the years to support himself, until in 2012 . Bavarian customs officials swooped and confiscated the collection of . 1,400 works. Authorities kept most, but allowed Mr Gurlitt to keep hundreds after investigators could find no evidence they were looted. With . his death, the ownership of those artworks had seemed to have been . thrown into doubt. But now all eyes are on his final will. Stephan Holzinger, Mr Gurlitt's lawyer, told the BBC that Mr Gurlitt wrote the will in the last few weeks. 'It . now falls to the probate court to determine if the will is valid and . whether a contract of inheritance exists,' he said. 'I can understand . that there is now wild speculation, but I don't want to comment on that . at this stage.' Munich daily . Süddeutsche Zeitung claimed it had learned that Mr Gurlitt intended his . entire collection to remain together and go to a museum in Switzerland . or Austria, where he had contacts. The . paper claimed that authorities in Germany were angry the controversial . collector had chosen to leave the artworks to a foreign institution. The Kunstmuseum in Bern, Switzerland: The museum said it has learned it is the 'unrestricted and unfettered sole heir' of Mr Gurlitt, who died yesterday at his home in Munich, Germany . Mr Gurlitt, who had been ill with a heart condition, learnt just two months ago that he would be allowed to keep several hundred paintings after prosecutors said they could find no evidence that they had been looted. He claimed all the paintings were legally acquired by his father, but at least 500 were found to have been either stolen by the Nazis or were strong-armed from Jewish collectors at rock-bottom prices. Mr Gurlitt’s father Hildebrand was Nazi Germany’s leading expert on modern art, personally tasked by Hitler to sell paintings he despised abroad to help fund the Third Reich’s war effort. However, Mr Gurlitt Snr secretly kept many of the pictures for himself. After the war, he was questioned by the American Army’s ‘Monuments Men’ unit but never charged with any crimes. He lied that the bulk of his collection had been destroyed in the Allied bombing of Dresden in 1945. In fact, the artworks survived intact and he passed them on to his son, a lifelong bachelor, who said before his death: ‘I never loved anything or anybody in life but my paintings.’ The collection, which includes works by Picasso, Matisse and Dix was discovered inside his Munich apartment . Under a new deal with prosecutors, art historians will have a year to examine the 1,401 works to establish where they came from and if they were stolen (pictured, a work by Otto Dix) In 2011, he was investigated as a . possible tax fraudster when he was found with money he could not . explain, but investigators later found paintings hidden behind tins of . beans and out-of-date food in his flat. In February this year, more paintings, worth at least £100million, were found in a house he owned in Salzburg, Austria. But a court decided he could get between 300 and 350 paintings back. Under the terms of deal, the . art will be held at a secret location for a year while historians carry . out background checks on each of the paintings. At the end of this year any . painting which investigators had not finished studying would have been handed back to the 81-year-old. Augsburg . state prosecutor Matthias Nickolai said at the time: 'We have come across new . evidence in the course of the investigation ... that leads us to . re-evaluate the legal situation.' Gurlitt's lawyer Tido Park applauded the decision to release the art, saying: 'It's a good day for Cornelius Gurlitt.' The . German government came under fire - especially by families whose . relatives were robbed by the Nazis - for keeping silent for almost two . years about the trove of art works.

Separately, representatives for Gurlitt . later secured a further 238 artworks at a dilapidated house he owned in . Salzburg, Austria. Gurlitt was never under investigation in Austria and . those works weren't seized by authorities. Gurlitt was set to have the paintings returned at the end of the year if investigators could not unearth whether they were stolen (painting by Henri Matisse) One of the pieces of work discovered in his flat was this masterpiece by Franz Marc . Last year it transpired that Mr Gurlitt had given four of his paintings to his brother-in-law. They may also have been looted by the Nazis, according to the authorities. What happens to the artwork now remains to be seen. It could go to Mr Gurlitt's younger sister, Benita, but she would have to be named in a will - and such a document has yet to surface. Christopher Marinello, Director and Founder of Art Recovery International, told MailOnline: 'It's a pretty murky situation. We don't know if he left a will. If his lawyers were smart they would have cleared up the issue in advance. It'll get cleared up over the next couple of days.' One of the works of art in the trove - a Matisse valued at up to £60million - has been claimed by the ex-wife of Dominique Strauss Kahn. Sitting Woman is thought to have belonged to Anne Sinclair’s maternal grandfather, the late French art dealer Paul Rosenberg. Mr Marinello is representing the Rosenberg family and added that he's confident it will be returned to them. He said that a second claim for the painting had 'been dispensed with'. Gurlitt stayed out of sight after news of his collection broke, barely talking to media, and was apparently overwhelmed by the publicity. In January, his representatives said they were considering claims for some of the works and that he was seeking ‘fair and just solutions’ to the case. ‘So much has happened in the past weeks and months, and is still happening,’ he wrote on a newly created website shortly afterward. ‘I only wanted to live with my pictures, in peace and calm.’ Gurlitt was born in Hamburg in 1932 and came from a prominent German family of artists, composers and collectors, but little is known about his life beyond his position as the heir of his father Hildebrand's art collection. When U.S. investigators questioned Hildebrand Gurlitt after the end of World War II about the origins of his collection, they were doubtful whether all the pieces really belonged to him but eventually decided that he was the rightful owner of most of them. After his father's 1956 death in a car accident, Cornelius Gurlitt lived together with his mother in Munich until she died in 1968. He reportedly lived a reclusive life, making a living by selling paintings from time to time. Experts who examined the pieces seized in Munich said they included both ‘degenerate art’ and looted art.

The Nazis took so-called degenerate art - mostly avant-garde modern art, such as expressionism - from museums and public institutions because it was deemed a corrupting influence on the German people. Looted art was stolen or bought for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell under duress during the Third Reich. For the heirs of those collectors, the discovery raised hopes of recovering art, but the slow release of information by the German government stirred frustration. After much back and forth, Gurlitt eventually agreed last month to a deal with the German government, under which hundreds of works owned by the collector would be checked for a Nazi-era past while staying in government hands.

"Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, who hid a £1bn trove of suspected stolen Nazi art has died in his Munich flat . The ownership of a £1billion hoard of masterpieces plundered by the Nazis during the Second World War has been thrown into doubt by the death of its keeper. Cornelius Gurlitt, 81, whose father Hildebrand built the  collection while working for  Hitler, died in the Munich flat where he kept the paintings. They included works by Renoir, Matisse and Picasso that were either looted or bought from Jews at knock-down prices. Mr Gurlitt, an eccentric recluse, had been selling them over the years to support himself. The collection of more than 1,400 works was discovered in a raid by customs officials in 2012, but news of its existence only surfaced last November amid tax and ownership disputes. Mr Gurlitt never married or had children, but a number of his cousins could qualify as heirs to the collection. However, experts said his death could leave the paintings in legal limbo for years to come. ‘What will become of his treasure?’ one newspaper asked. Süddeutsche Zeitung added: ‘How much was his and how much was Nazi art? He leaves behind as many puzzles as pictures.’ Mr Gurlitt, who had been ill with a heart condition, learnt just two months ago that he would be allowed to keep several hundred paintings after prosecutors said they could find no evidence that they had been looted. He claimed all the paintings were legally acquired by his father, but at least 500 were found to have been either stolen by the Nazis or were strong-armed from Jewish collectors at rock-bottom prices. Mr Gurlitt’s father was Nazi Germany’s leading expert on modern art, personally tasked by Hitler to sell paintings he despised abroad to help fund the Third Reich’s war effort. However, Mr Gurlitt Snr secretly kept many of the  pictures for himself. After the war, he was questioned by the American Army’s ‘Monuments Men’ unit but never charged with any crimes. He lied that the bulk of his collection had been destroyed in the Allied bombing of Dresden in 1945. In fact, the artworks survived intact and he passed them on to his son, a lifelong bachelor, who said before his death: ‘I never loved anything or anybody in life but my paintings.’ The collection, which includes works by Picasso, Matisse and Dix was discovered inside his Munich apartment . Under a new deal with prosecutors, art historians will have a year to examine the 1,401 works to establish where they came from and if they were stolen (pictured, a work by Otto Dix) In 2011, he was investigated as a . possible tax fraudster when he was found with money he could not . explain, but investigators later found paintings hidden behind tins of . beans and out-of-date food in his flat. In February this year, more paintings, worth at least £100million, were found in a house he owned in Salzburg, Austria. But a court decided he could get between 300 and 350 paintings back. Under the terms of deal, the . art will be held at a secret location for a year while historians carry . out background checks on each of the paintings. At the end of this year any . painting which investigators had not finished studying would have been handed back to the 81-year-old. Augsburg . state prosecutor Matthias Nickolai said at the time: 'We have come across new . evidence in the course of the investigation ... that leads us to . re-evaluate the legal situation.' Gurlitt's lawyer Tido Park applauded the decision to release the art, saying: 'It's a good day for Cornelius Gurlitt.' The . German government came under fire - especially by families whose . relatives were robbed by the Nazis - for keeping silent for almost two . years about the trove of art works. Gurlitt was arrested in 2012 but it wasn't until last year that knowledge of the collection became public.

"The beauty terrorist: Linda Dohmen, 20, won the Miss Krefeld title only recently. Police found automatic machine pistol, a silencer, crowbars, knives and rubber face masks in her home . Police in Germany have arrested a beauty queen who they say strolled the catwalk by day... and plotted a terrorist attack by night. Linda Dohmen, 20, was arrested alongside her brother, Frank, 22, when an elite team of S.W.A.T. agents stormed their home in Krefeld, western Germany, this morning. There they found an automatic machine pistol, a silencer, crowbars, knives and rubber face masks along with plans to seize hostages at a supermarket where she used to work as a checkout girl. Detectives say the beauty queen - who was crowned Miss Krefeld last month - and her brother were planning on taking the hostages at the Real supermarket in Krefeld. A spokesman for the State Criminal Office in Duesseldorf said: 'We have information she and he were part of a four man band planning this hostage taking for money. 'Chains for holding people were also seized from her apartment.' Her brother and she are being held without bail in a secure police station in the former industrial town in Germany's western Ruhr region. He has form for trying to blackmail 2,000 people out of 500,000 pounds with offers of fake loans. Linda, who won the Miss Krefeld title only recently, dreamed of a modelling career and had quit her job as a supermarket cashier in January last year. Police deployed officers from the specialist SEK - SAS trained paramilitary officers - to carry out the arrests because they learned that she and her brother were 'armed and serious.' Public plans: On March 25 she posted a picture of herself and two men wearing masks on her Facebook page . On March 25 she posted a picture of herself and two men wearing masks on her Facebook page. She recently signed on with a modelling agency and was looking for work at events like car shows and conferences when she was arrested. A former student pal of her's told a local Ruhr radio station: 'She was always ambitious and hungry for money but this....it defies explanation. She seemed such a nice girl.'","Linda Dohmen, 20, was arrested with brother at their home in Krefeld .

"The U.S. government could be responsible for a recent spate of cancer among South American leaders, according to Venezuela's outspoken president Hugo Chavez. He suggested that the U.S. might have 'invented technology to spread cancer', and warned other left-wing heads of state that they could be targeted next. Mr Chavez, one of several Latin American leaders to have contracted the disease in the last year, said he had developed his theories after Fidel Castro described the CIA's repeated attempts to assassinate him. Scroll down for video... Outburst: Hugo Chavez has accused the U.S. of spreading cancer among South American leaders . Illness: Argentina's Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, former president of Brazil, have both been cancer sufferers . Although the Venezuelan leader insisted he was 'not accusing anyone', his controversial theory is unlikely to improve relations between the U.S. and Venezuela. Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, president of Argentina, announced on Tuesday that she was suffering from thyroid cancer, which has a high survival rate. Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez received treatment in Cuba earlier this year for an unknown cancer. He had his fourth and final bout of chemotherapy in Cuba last month. He had surgery to remove a tumour from his pelvic region in June and is now being evaluated by doctors, who hope he may fully recover. Argentinian leader Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said on Dec 22 that she has thyroid cancer. The disease was discovered during routine medical tests, but it is thought she has a good chance of survival. The thyroid gland cancer has not spread to other parts of her body. She will have an operation on January 4. The health of Dilma Rousseff, the president of Brazil, made the news in 2009 when she was diagnosed with cancer of the lymph system. Brazil's first female president has cancer check-ups every six months but said the cancer is 'resolved' and she is in 'good health'. Ex-Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was diagnosed with throat cancer in October this year. The popular former leader, 66, began chemotherapy to treat a tumour in his larynx, with medics describing him as 'well'. Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, 60, was diagnosed with lymphoma in August 2010 but is now in remission after undergoing chemotherapy. Doctors discovered the lymphoma following a biopsy on a gland they had removed from his groin during minor surgery in August 2010. The malignant tumour is treatable with chemo. Other South American politicians who have been struck by the disease include Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff, her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and Fernando Lugo, president of Paraguay. Mr Chavez received treatment in Cuba earlier this year for an unknown cancer, and now claims to be cured. In a speech made to the military . yesterday and broadcast on television, he said that he hoped to call a . summit of leaders who had survived cancer. 'It’s . very difficult to explain, even with the law of probabilities, what has . been happening to some of us in Latin America,' Mr Chavez said. 'Would it be so strange that they’ve invented technology to spread cancer and we won’t know about it for 50 years?' He . also warned his allies Evo Morales, of Bolivia, and Ecuador's Rafael . Correa that they should watch out for attempts to bring them down. 'Evo, take care of yourself - Correa, be careful, we just don’t know,' he joked. Mr . Morales said earlier this year that he was nervous about attending a UN . summit in New York in case the U.S. government should plant drugs on . his plane in an attempt to discredit him. Mr Chavez said that he had been . speaking to Mr Castro, who is believed to have been a CIA target for . many years after he took power in Cuba in 1959. 'Fidel . always tells me, ""Chavez be careful, they’ve developed technology, be . careful with what you eat, they could stick you with a small needle."" 'In . any case, I’m not accusing anyone, I’m just using my freedoms to . reflect and issue comments on very strange events that are hard to . explain.' The Venezuelan president has been a vocal opponent of capitalism, and particularly of the U.S., since his election in 1999. He . described the U.S. as 'the greatest terrorist in world history', said . that George W. Bush was 'the Devil' and described Barack Obama as . 'ignorant'.

"Peter Morris stood transfixed as he watched his sister Claire walk down the aisle, while the groom – resplendent in a kilt and ruff – stood waiting proudly by the front pew. As they exchanged vows, Peter swallowed hard. Yet his emotional reaction was borne not of joy, but of grief. For the scene unfolding before his eyes was not the wedding itself, which took place in 1993, but a recreation for ITV drama The Widower. The Widower featuring Sheridan Smith, an ITV drama, tells the tale of Claire Morris who was murdered on a roadside in Aberdeenshire by her husband Malcolm Webster months after their wedding . The show tells the shocking story of how Claire was murdered by her husband Malcolm Webster on a remote roadside in Aberdeenshire less than eight months later. Malcolm left the 32-year-old drugged and helpless in his flaming 4x4 vehicle as part of a life-insurance scam. It would be five years before her family discovered the truth about her death – and another three years before they saw Webster jailed. In an exclusive interview, Mr Morris revealed his astonishment at the realistic portrayal  of his sister by actress Sheridan Smith. Mr Morris, who met  Ms Smith while working  as an adviser on the production, said: ‘Sheridan captured Claire completely. I miss that camaraderie of a sibling and I thank Sheridan for giving that back to me for a while. Malcolm Webster (left) murdered his wife Claire eight months after their wedding . ‘I feel as though if I want to see Claire again all I have to do is switch on this drama. At one stage off-set Sheridan hooked her arm through mine, and I told her it was exactly how Claire did it.’ Also involved as advisers to the producers were Webster’s second wife Felicity Drumm, who later survived a carbon-copy murder attempt, and Simone Banarjee. Webster, played by Reece Shearsmith in the drama, was about to kill her when he was finally arrested. Webster, now 54, who became known as the Black Widower, was convicted of murder and attempted murder, and was jailed for 30 years at Glasgow High Court in 2011. Sentencing him, the judge, Lord Bannatyne, said: ‘This was a murder that could properly be described as cold-blooded, brutal and callous.’ Originally from the Surrey commuter town of Guildford, Webster met Claire at the Scottish hospital where they were both nurses. Within weeks of their wedding, Claire discovered her husband  had debts running into thousands of pounds and she began questioning his spending. Slowly, his veneer as the caring husband crumbled. He began raiding the hospital drugs cabinet and crumbling strong tranquillisers into her food. He had taken out life insurance policies and hatched  a plan to murder Claire and cash them in. Having drugged Claire to the point where she was barely able to walk, Webster put her in the passenger seat of their car, ran it off the road at a secluded spot near their home, doused it in petrol and then set it alight. After pocketing more than £200,000 in insurance payouts, Webster played the grieving widower  to perfection. Peter recalled: ‘On the day of the funeral I held the cord  to lower the coffin in my left hand and with my right hand I held  Malcolm’s hand. There were tears running down his face. It is beyond my understanding that someone could have faked those tears.’ As the Morris family struggled with their grief, Webster moved to Saudi Arabia where, in January 1997, he met nurse Felicity Drumm. He discovered that she had amassed considerable savings. Within eight months the pair had moved to Felicity’s native New  Zealand where they married. After the birth of the couple’s son Edward, they sold Felicity’s house and decided to buy a new home for which, Webster claimed, he could pay half once his money in Scotland had been  transferred. In the meantime he talked Felicity into adding his name to her bank account. Pictured: The crashed and burned out 4x4 in which Claire died. Husband Malcolm Webster drugged Claire put her in the passenger seat of their car, ran it off the road, doused it in petrol and set it alight . In 1999 he announced the money had been transferred and that he was taking her and Edward on a  picnic to celebrate the news. Then, just as he had done with Claire, he strapped his wife into the passenger seat of their car and plied her with bottled water infused with tranquillisers, saying she needed to keep her fluids up. That is the last thing she can remember until the incessant ringing of her mobile roused her. It was her father, who insisted they drive to his house. Once there, he told her that Webster had drained £300,000 from of her account. When Felicity opened the boot of the car she found it filled with cans of petrol. Sheridan Smith and Reece Shearsmith are pictured here playing Malcolm Webster and Claire Morris on the day of their wedding. Eight months later he murdered Claire in a life-insurance scam . She also discovered Webster had insurance policies valued at more than £1  million, all bearing Felicity’s forged signature. Today, having also helped with the ITV drama, Felicity says she is just relieved that she escaped her marriage with her life. Webster managed to flee New Zealand before a police investigation got under way and headed to the Scottish town of Oban. Although arrest warrants for the murder of his first wife and attempted murder of his second had been issued, it wasn’t long before Webster began hunting for a new wealthy partner. He met another nurse, Simone Banarjee, in 2005 and they couple got engaged a year later. Webster persuaded Simone – the daughter of a wealthy surgeon – to make him the beneficiary of her will and to add his name to her bank account. Reece Shearsmith plays Malcolm Webster in ITV's The Widower. Webster murdered his wife Claire (played by Sheridan Smith). He was sentenced to 30 years behind bars in 2011 . In 2008 Simone was stunned when police came to her door to allege that Webster had murdered Claire and attempted to murder his second wife. Webster was arrested soon afterwards and Simone and Felicity gave evidence at his trial. For Peter, the drama has healed some wounds. He said: ‘Like everyone else, Webster duped me. He is a callous murderer. I don’t know if he is watching The Widower, but what I do know is that the drama is telling the truth of the terrible death my sister suffered.’ Part two of The Widower will be shown on ITV1 tomorrow at 9pm.","Malcolm Webster murdered wife Claire as part of life-insurance scam .

"Cash on tap: Scarlet Johansson is being paid £243,000 by SodaStream to appear in their advert . When Scarlett Johansson chose her lucrative SodaStream contract over her charity work with Oxfam, it appeared to be an unusual choice. The 29-year-old issued a strong public statement backing the controversial company which operates in the West Bank, despite Oxfam’s claim that the firm profits from illegal trade that harms Palestinians. But The Mail on Sunday has learned the clues to her outspoken position may lie in her family’s struggle with money. The blonde star of The Girl With The Pearl Earring and The Island admits she hankers after wealth and squanders money. And while she commands huge fees for her film appearances, including a reputed £13 million for Avengers 2, she has also amassed a stable of sponsors, with top-brand firms paying her £3 million a year for acting as an ambassador for their goods. ‘It’s nice to have money. I didn’t grow up with it so it’s nice to have it,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I’m not at all frugal and I don’t save – to my business manager’s dismay. I like to be generous. I can’t stand people who are tight with their money, it drives me crazy. ‘It’s different if you’re scrimping and saving because you need to, to save up for something. But I cannot stand cheapness.’ Johansson, ranked 12th on the Forbes List of the top-earning superstars, grew up in a sprawling subsidised housing complex in a part of Manhattan once nicknamed the Wild West. Her Danish father Karsten, a struggling architect, and her mother Melanie, an Ashkenazi Jew, struggled to pay rent as they raised Scarlett,  her twin brother Hunter and siblings Vanessa and Adrian. Controversial: Johansson, 29, released a strongly-worded statement backing SodaStream . Of her childhood, she said: ‘My father barely made enough to get  by. We moved house every year and finally we settled in a housing development for lower-middle-income families. 'We went to state school and depended on programmes for school lunches and transport.’ Today the family’s once run-down . three-bed apartment in Greenwich Village, bought by Scarlett’s siblings . at a discount under a tenants’ right- to-buy scheme, is worth millions . thanks to gentrification and the booming property market. One . neighbour said: ‘Back then, this was a rough area. We called it the . Wild West and there wasn’t much money around. It’s all changed now.’ Frugal times: Johansson, circled with her siblings, got by on 'barely enough' as a child . SodaStream is said to be paying £243,000 for Johansson’s advertisement, which will be shown live during the Super Bowl today. Her decision to remain linked to the firm, whose factory is in Mishor Adumim, an industrial zone in the Jerusalem hills, has infuriated Oxfam. The charity insists it is incompatible for Johansson to represent both it and SodaStream. It said: ‘Oxfam believes that businesses such as SodaStream that operate in settlements further the ongoing poverty and denial of rights of the Palestinian communities that we work to support. We are opposed to all trade from Israeli settlements, which are illegal under international law.’ Johansson insists SodaStream provides employment for hundreds of West Bank Palestinians along with Israeli Jews. She said: ‘It supports neighbours working alongside each other, receiving equal pay, equal benefits and equal rights.’","Scarlett Johansson admitted to Mail on Sunday she hankers after wealth .

"Judges’ copies of the leading Oscar and Bafta contenders – 12 Years A Slave, Gravity and American Hustle – have leaked on to the web for illegal download. The pirated versions of the films appear to have originally been sent to members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, who decide the winners of the Oscars, and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. There are around 6,000 people in each. The illicit copy of the sci-fi epic Gravity includes the warning: ‘This secure screener is on loan for you, the member’ – the same message appearing on the films sent to Bafta members towards the end of last year. Warning: This message appears on an illegal copy of Saving Mr Banks - the same note that flashes up on preview copies of movies for people who pick Oscar and BAFTA winners . The pirated versions of comedy drama American Hustle include a screen alert that reads: ‘For Your Consideration Only.’ And the copy of 12 Years A Slave is marked ‘Property of Fox. May not be copied or transferred or sold.’ The three films, which are competing for Best Film at the Oscars and the Baftas, have only just been released into cinemas and are not yet available on DVD. Several other award contenders are also available on the same pirate sites, including The Wolf  Of Wall Street, Saving Mr Banks and The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug. The copy of The Wolf Of Wall Street contains the on-screen message that this version is ‘For Awards Consideration’. Many of the films also carry a warning that ‘an invisible water mark’ has been embedded in the movie, on the disc and even in the packaging, any of which can be used to identify who it was sent to. Leaked: American Hustle is one of the films pirated on the web, along with 12 Years A Slave and Gravity . Studios have warned judges that unauthorised distribution of the films could lead to ‘civil and criminal penalties’. They have even advised on how to destroy the DVDs once the awards season has drawn to a close on March 2. One Bafta source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Most members take the responsibility very seriously but the problem arises when a film is lent out to a family member or if a family member takes it without permission.’ It cannot be established whether the leak was definitely from Bafta or Oscar voters. Bodies such as the Screen Actors Guild, which presented its awards last night, are also believed to send out films. The Mail on Sunday has decided not to identify the pirate sites but some film fans have already tweeted their joy at finding them. One wrote: ‘Bless Awards Screeners’ and another added: ‘I down loaded all of em last night, marathon viewing going on.’","Preview copies are sent to 6,000 judges who pick Oscar and BAFTA winners .

"Given the choice between hanging out with Aziz Ansari during the comedian's recent trip to Washington, D.C. and a round of golf, President Barack Obama chose  golf after the actor and comedian was already at the White House waiting for him. Ansari talked about the high-level 'dis' in a radio interview earlier this week with Howard Stern, noting that Obama was the one who suggested they get together when he was in town. But when he got to the White House, the president was no where to be found. A White House official giving him a tour of the building claimed Obama had 'national security' meetings, yet Ansari says he overheard a Secret Service member talking about Obama playing golf. 'So I got dissed by Obama,' Ansari told Stern, according to the Daily Caller. Scroll down for video . Aziz Ansari  is pictured here arriving at Late Show With David Letterman Show in New York City on Oct. 6. That same day, Ansari told radio host Howard Stern that Obama blew him off for golf when he visited Washington, D.C. last month . Ansari performed in Washington, D.C. at the Verizon Center on Saturday, September 27. According to the White House pool report from that day, Obama did in fact play golf that afternoon - his 194th game since taking office. In his conversation with Stern on Oct. 6, Ansari, an Obama supporter who performed at a fundraiser for the president's reelection campaign in 2012, described his disappointing trip to the White House in detail. 'Two weekends ago I went to do a show in D.C. I was doing the Verizon Center. I was very excited,' Ansari told Stern. 'And we got an email saying, like, ""hey, you know, do you want to come do a tour of the White House. Like, the POTUS is a big fan. Would love to say hi if he’s around."" And so I was like, ""yea, I’ll go do a tour. It would be great to say, like, hi to him again."" ' 'And so I go and, you know, dress up in my suit and stuff,' Ansari said. When he arrived at the White House Ansari says he was informed the president may not be able to meet with him after all. 'The guy showing us a round – nicest guy – is like, ""look, we are going to try to get you in to see the president. He has got a lot of meetings today. Like, he’s got a lot of national security stuff. But, you know, we are going to try to do it."" 'I’m like, ""aright great. Totally fine,"" ' Ansari recalled. 'So we are like walking around. We are just trying to stay there for a long time to increase our odds of like actually [seeing Obama],' he said . After 'waiting and waiting,' Ansari said he heard 'another Secret Service guy, like, walk by and was like, ""alright, let’s do it. POTUS wants to play golf."" ' 'And I was like, ""WHAT? He’s going to go play golf? I thought he was a big fan; he wanted to say hi to me?"" 'Ansari exclaimed. ' ""There’s no national security meeting. He’s going to play golf."" ' Ansari and the president had met once before at the fundraiser the Parks and Recreation star headlined for Obama's reelection campaign in March of 2012. Speaking about the encounter on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon a few weeks later, Ansari said Obama surprised him by coming back stage to chat afterward. Ansari told Fallon the president waltzed up to him and said: 'Aziz, what's going on? You blowin' up, man! What're you up to?' 'And I was like, huh? Why are you talking to me like my little brother Aniz? Don't you have the nuclear codes?' Ansari said. Even though the president teased him about having more twitter followers during his opening remarks at the fundraiser, Ansari recalled their meeting positively during his appearance on Late Night. 'This dude acts the exact same way I could act if I was president,' he proclaimed.","Ansari says Obama suggested he stop by the White House during his trip to Washington, D.C. last month .

"Dita Von Teese has just celebrated her 40th birthday. And she has done so not with a silent mope over a mug of gin about getting old, but a whoop and a cheer...and the confession that she is in better shape now than she ever was in her 20s. The 'Queen of Burlesque', who was married to rock singer Marilyn Manson from 2005 to 2007, said: 'I have better knowledge of my body and how to treat it. Between 18 and 20 I was a few pounds heavier, as I used to drink fizzy drinks and eat fast food.' Fit at 40: Dita Von Teese, pictured as a fresh-faced young dancer (left) and in New York on Friday (right), says she feels in better shape now than she did in her 20s . Shaken, not stirred: Dita Von Teese performs her famous Martini glass routine during a photo-call for the Erotica show in London in 2006 . In an interview with Closer magazine, Von Teese - who is 5ft 3in and weighs 8st 3lbs - also admitted going through a 'party girl' phase in the 90s. During that time - when she was taking Ecstasy and LSD - her weight dropped to just 6.5st. The odd couple: Dita Von Teese, aged 29, pictured in Hollywood with beau Marilyn Manson, whom she married in 2005 . 'I got skinny,' said the Michigan-born dancer whose real name is Heather Sweet. 'I was worried about the way I looked but also about the impact it was having on my health. 'I remember seeing a picture of myself and my ribs were sticking out. 'That was my motivation for not doing drugs anymore.' Von Teese, who began performing . burlesque in 1992 and whose most famous routine involves her frolicking . inside an enormous Martini glass, also revealed she didn't . expect to find herself where she is now, aged 40, when she was young. 'I thought I'd be married and retired by 28. I didn't think I'd be at the top of my career in striptease. 'I don't worry about having kids and . it affecting my body. 'I'd have to rethink things if that happened, but . it wouldn't make me any less of a woman if it didn't.' She confesses that she hasn't yet drawn a line through having plastic surgery and will one day 'probably look at lasers'. The star explains that she maintains . her tiny 22-inch waist (which can be squeezed down to 16.5in) by . eating healthily, rarely drinking, avoiding bread, and drinking a vegetable . smoothie made from ingredients including parsley, . coriander and spinach every morning. She also exercises daily and has worn a corset since . she was just 18. Saying she . feels best about herself around eight stone, the raven-haired beauty . says her strict exercise regime includes Pilates, ballet, exercise . videos, horse-riding and dressage, and she plans to take up fencing . soon, too. But just like . the rest of us, Von Teese has several 'cheat' foods she can't always . resist. Crisps, crunchy sweets and Indian food feature high on her . naughty-but-nice list. Unlike the rest of us, the woman's incredible willpower means these 'naughty' treats are few and far between, which is why she looks as amazing now as she did when she burst on to the burlesque scene over two decades ago. Happy Birthday Dita Von Teese. Cosmetic enhancement: Von Teese, who hasn't had any cosmetic surgery yet, confesses that she hasn't ruled it out and will one day 'probably look at lasers' In love: Marilyn Manson and Dita Von Teese arrive for the Elle Style Awards 2006, at the Atlantis Gallery at the Old Truman Brewery, east London .","She exercises every day to maintain her 8st 3lbs weight .

"The parents of runaway Indira Gainiyeva last night issued an emotional appeal for her boarding school not to expel their daughter, excusing her by saying: ‘She is young, perhaps she fell in love.’ Speaking publicly for the first time since the schoolgirl did a midnight flit to the Dominican Republic with her boyfriend, her mother Firuza pleaded for Indira to send a text ‘or anything’ to show she is safe. ‘That would be enough,’ she said. Midnight flit: Indira Gainiyeva, above right, with her mother Firuza and younger sister Rufina . ‘I beg and pray she is in good health. She knows that she and our other children mean more than anything for myself and my husband. No-one is more important.’ From her home in Kyzylorda, southern Kazakhstan, Mrs Gainiyeva insisted Indira was a good  student, while her father Ravi claimed Indira, who turned 17 on Friday, may have run away ‘to celebrate her birthday’. Indira has not been seen since sneaking out of Stonyhurst College, in Clitheroe, Lancashire, with fellow pupil Eddy Bunyan, 16, on Monday. The pair were believed to have fled to the city of Puerto Plata. However, last night police said they may have moved on to Cabarete, a town famed for its all-night parties and watersports. Mrs Gainiyeva revealed she and her husband are desperate for the headmaster to take Indira back at the £30,000-a-year school. Mr Gainiyeva, 50, said: ‘I can only ask the school to forgive her such a behaviour. Because she is not really such a kind of person. She studies, she strives, she wants to be well educated. I’m concerned this will damage the school’s reputation.' Missing: Indira and boyfriend Eddy Bunyan are still missing despite widespread searches across the island . As the search continued last night, . postings under Indira’s name on popular social media website ask.fm gave . an intriguing insight into her character, hopes and plans. The messages reveal an intelligent free spirit with an adventurous side who cites laziness and apathy as her  enemies, and identifies Karl Marx and Pushkin as her heroes. She says her biggest dream is to have a life abroad, naming Spain the country she would most like to live in. She says she loves to take risks on a daily basis, defining the secret of happiness as being able to ‘do what you like and be yourself’. Her answers on the site – where users ask each other a range of questions – are written in Russian and have been translated by The Mail on Sunday. Hunt: Guards on the Caribbean island have plastered beaches with posters as they look for the youngsters . Asked how often she lies, she says: ‘I have to sometimes, but try to do it as rarely as possible.’ The teenager, who moved to Britain from Kazakhstan to study, made the comments five months ago. She also reveals a softer side when she says: ‘I want to make people who are with me happy, build a strong family and become a successful person.’ Indira and Eddy are believed to have planned their escape meticulously, turning off their mobiles and buying pay-as-you go phones, which cannot be traced. A friend of Eddy’s said: ‘I heard they booked that the flights using credit cards but then took lots of cash so they could pay for the hotel without being detected, which is clever.’ Of Indira’s parents’ pleas, the ex-pupil added: ‘They definitely won’t be going back. They’ll be expelled.’","Indira Gainiyeva's mother Firuza pleads her daughter to send a text .

"When Princess Leia appeared before Luke Skywalker as a hologram in the 1977 blockbuster Star Wars, it was very much a work of science fiction. But fast-forward four decades and the hologram telephone call – which will allow callers to see a live 3D image of the other person on the line – is set to become reality. The technology is being pioneered by Leia Display Systems, a Polish company named after the Star Wars heroine. Scroll down for video . Using a camera with two lenses and a tablets, your image is blended into one and beamed onto a screen . Leia Display Systems, a Polish company named after the Star Wars character, aims to have a model by next year . It aims to have a working model of the telephone operating by next year after it successfully built interactive 3D hologram machines. To make a 3D phone call, a person will sit in front of a specially adapted camera featuring two lenses and a microphone. The two images the lenses create are blended to form a 3D version and streamed via the internet to the person who is being called. A hologram machine will receive the image and beam it using a laser projector on to a ‘screen’ of water vapour, which gives the image its third dimension. The hologram image will speak, move and listen in real time. The company also believes its invention will be on the market within five years. ‘Our holograms will take video- phone calls to the next level,’ said Marcin Panek, chief executive of Leia Display Systems. The firm claims people will be able to use the devise - not unlike a tablet - in their own homes in five years . ‘We are on the frontier of technology that was imagined in movies 40 years ago – it is science fiction becoming science fact. ‘It will be as if loved ones, friends and family are standing right in front of you while you talk with them halfway across the world. ‘At the moment our holograms  are made using machines that are more than 6ft high but we are designing smaller versions that can be set up on a coffee table in a living room. ‘It’s incredible. Ten years ago people would have been astounded at the idea of tablet devices but now they are everywhere. 'It will be the same with holograms. It is still early days but we hope to sell hologram telephone devices within the next five years.’ Star Wars was famed for scenes like this where Ki Adi Mundi appears virtually for a Jedi meeting . Mr Panek said the possibilities for the technology range from relatives virtually attending family occasions to specialist surgeons overseeing hospital operations while located on the other side of the world. He said the company was inspired after noticing the 3D effect created when a nightclub laser is beamed on to dry ice. He added that the first systems will cost thousands of pounds but, as with any technology breakthrough, the price will come down once they become more commonplace. Mr Panek also claimed that within ten years we will see the creation  of a Star Trek-style fully holographic room, in which 3D objects can be viewed and manipulated from every angle. He added: ‘It is not impossible,  and with the technology moving so fast, it is only a matter of time. ‘Within the next decade we will also be able to watch hologram football matches and have fully interactive walk-in hologram rooms. It’s very exciting.’","Leia Display Systems to have working model operating next year .

"A man has been shot in the chest by officers after he allegedly threatened police with a baseball bat. The 45-year-old man is in a critical condition in Liverpool Hospital after the incident in Sydney's south-west. Police had chased the man from a home in Parkland Avenue, Macquarie Fields, at about 1.20am on Tuesday, to Hispano Place in Ingleburn. Police reportedly first used a taser on the man before they shot him, after a short five minute pursuit in which he was driving a Holden Commodore.

'Once the vehicle was pulled up, we've been confronted by the male who's immediately gone at them with a baseball bat and things have unfolded from there,' Superintendent Sean Gersbach told media on Tuesday. The man was acting aggressively towards police, he said. Police were originally called to the house in Macquarie Fields following reports of a domestic violence incident. Detectives are now at the scene of the shooting and a critical incident team from Bankstown Local Area Command will investigate the shooting.

"David Cameron was facing potential embarrassment last night over a high-profile publicity stunt to promote his controversial Help To Buy scheme. On Thursday the Prime Minister visited the home of attractive blonde Sharon Ray, 30, in Southampton and sipped tea on her sofa while chatting to her about how the scheme had helped her get on the property ladder. She appeared on BBC News bulletins talking about the advantages of the scheme while Mr Cameron played with her two-year-old daughter, Maisie. Stunt: David Cameron with Sharon and Maisie on Thursday, when he visited her to promote the Help To Buy scheme which she used to help her get a foot on the property ladder with this flat in Southampton . Publicity: Mr Cameron's tweet about the meeting . But last night it emerged Ms Ray is a sales director at the estate agency which marketed and sold her the £145,000 two-bedroom ground floor flat last month. Critics took to the internet suggesting viewers had been deceived and perhaps Ms Ray was not the deserving case she seemed. The Help To Buy scheme is aimed at helping aspiring home owners who are struggling to get on the housing ladder because of spiralling property prices. Although Ms Ray would be eligible for a mortgage under the scheme, controversy erupted when her professional background came to light on an online blog yesterday afternoon. An anonymous blogger revealed that her professional name is Sharon O’Donnell and she is an award-winning sales director at nationwide chain Enfields. It also highlighted that she drives a £33,000 BMW 3 series convertible and said she was married. Soon after critics of the scheme took to Twitter to mock the apparent deceit. One tweeted ‘Mr Cameron and Ms Ray: Gobsmackingly audacious!’ Mr Cameron plays with Maisie's toys as Ms Ray looks on: It has since emerged that Ms Ray is in fact the sales director at the very firm of estate agents that handled the sale of the house - and that she drives a £33,000 car . Last night Ms Ray defended herself on Twitter. Posting as @shazlou1, she said she had a company car and separated from her husband six months ago. She posted: ‘I’ve done nothing wrong, I work 39 hrs a week, everything I hve I have worked very hard 4. When was it a crime to work hard?’ Other Twitter users were more supportive. Financial writer Paul Lewis wrote: ‘No story here. #HelpToBuy not for poor.  @shazlou1 has been clear.’ Ms Ray met the Prime Minister as one of the first 6,000 people to join the scheme, which enables buyers to get a mortgage with a five per cent deposit. BBC cameras recorded Mr Cameron with Ms Ray and Maisie at the flat. Downing Street said the BBC report had made clear she was an estate agent.","PM visited Sharon Ray at her home, bought with Help To Buy, on Thursday .

"Legend: Radio personality, Casey Kasem, attends the Golden Dads Awards ceremony at the Peterson Automotive Museum on June 15, 2005 in Los Angeles, California . The widow of radio icon Casey Kasem has been dumped by a second set of attorneys, the MailOnline can reveal. According to documents filed with the Superior Court in Pierce County, Washington, Jean Kasem was let go by Seattle based law firm Ryan, Swanson and Cleveland. The firm was representing Jean in a legal battle over her dead husband’s remains after Casey’s daughter Kerri blocked moves by Jean to have her father cremated. This comes after another legal group last week dumped Jean and is suing the former actress for not paying their fees. LA based Haney & Young claims it entered a contract on June 5 with Jean, who they allege ignored subsequent bills. The firm represented her in the fight to keep Casey on life-support while he was in hospital. According to TMZ the lawyers claim Jean rarely responds to their emails - and refuses to communicate by phone. She's also ignored mounting fees against Casey's Estate which they say could end up totaling $500,000. Battle: Kerri Kasem, (right), the daughter of the radio personality Casey Kasem, appears in  Kitsap County Superior Court, along with Casey Kasem's wife Jean Kasem, (second from left), and their attorneys in Port Orchard, Washington . A private investigator hired by Casey’s daughter Kerri to investigate Jean said she is 'out-of-control' and rapidly losing support. Logan Clarke told MailOnline: ‘Jean is out-of-control and has now been dumped by all of her attorneys, she’s flying without a plane. ‘She’s been playing games with the family and dragging them through court but she’s losing any support she had, soon she’ll be all alone.’ Casey Kasem passed away June 16 at the age of 82 following a battle with dementia and Lewy body disease. His declining health sparked a bitter family feud over his care and treatment. In October 2013, Kasem’s children with his former wife, actress Linda Myers, as well as Kasem’s brother and a business associate, went public. Feud: Jean Kasem with her husband, Casey Kasem (left) is battling the radio icon's daughter, Kerri, (right) for control of his body . The group held a protest outside Kasem’s home, alleging Jean wouldn’t let any of them see Casey and had been rebuffed in their efforts for three months. In May 2014, Jean told a judge that Casey was no longer in the United States, however, he turned up several days later in Washington state. On June 6, a Washington state court recognized the legal rights of Casey’s eldest children to see their father and gave daughter Kerri full conservator control of his affairs. Haney & Young initially won a ruling on Jean’s behalf that same month, when a Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered the legendary broadcaster to continue to be cared for at the Washington state hospital. Family: Casey Kasem and his first wife, Linda Myers with the couple's daughter, Kerri . That decision was reversed two days later when the judge authorized Kerri to remove her father from life support. Casey, the radio host of America's Top 40 and voice of animated television characters like Scooby-Doo's sidekick Shaggy, died June 15 at a hospital in Gig Harbor, Washington. Kerri asked a Pierce County Superior Court judge for authorization to seek an autopsy on her father as well as a temporary restraining order to ensure his body was held in cold storage and not cremated until that autopsy is completed. But since winning the order Kerri and the rest of the Kasem family have no clue where Casey’s body has been taken. It’s believed it was moved from a funeral home in Washington to one in Montreal, Canada. The Santa Monica police department is currently investigating claims of elder abuse against Casey in his final months.","Entertainment legend's widow dropped by lawyers for battling for control of his body .

"Festive spending is expected to hit £45,000 a second tomorrow in what is set to be the busiest shopping day in British history. Analysts are predicting consumers will spend a record £3.9 billion over 24 hours in a last-minute surge of present-buying. Spending will average £2.7 million a minute, with the peak coming between 1pm and 2pm, during office workers’ lunch breaks. Oxford Street was packed on Saturday but is expected to get even busier on Monday as shoppers rush out to buy last-minute gifts before the big day . Across the country retailers have slashed prices in store to encourage people in but full sales will not begin until Christmas eve . Visa, Europe’s biggest payment firm, predicts it will process 31 million UK card transactions, and Barclaycard expects customers to withdraw £25,000 a second from cash machines. Here are the best of the online and shop sales – and the times that some of the best bargains will be going live. And don’t forget, online sales continue after the shops close on Christmas Eve... CHRISTMAS EVE . From midnight . From 5pm . From 7pm . CHRISTMAS DAY . From midnight . From 8am . Time unknown . BOXING DAY . From 7am . From 8am . From 10am . The frenzy will continue on Christmas Eve and even throughout Christmas Day, when a record number of shops are either opening or launching online sales. It comes as retailers are slashing prices by more than 70 per cent and supermarkets open round the clock in a bid to boost their customer share. Mandy Ryan, an analyst for the  British Retail Consortium, said: ‘Consumer confidence is considerably higher than it was last year but times remain challenging. ‘People don’t feel like they have more money than ever but they are taking advantage of some great  discounts. ‘Inflation is much less than last year so shoppers can get that little bit extra for their money. 'The fact that Christmas falls on a Wednesday means that a lot of people have Monday and  Tuesday off so can get more shopping done. ‘Footfall is actually down but that is because more people than ever are choosing to do their shopping online.’ Jeremy Nicholds, director of commercial development at Visa Europe, said: ‘The rush to shop online at the beginning of the month will be mirrored on our high streets on December 23, which we predict will be the busiest day of the year. ‘With £862,500 expected to be spent every minute on the UK’s high streets with Visa cards, there are indications that this may  well be the best Christmas for retailers.’ As well as making the most of pre and post-Christmas sales, more retailers are offering cut-price goods online on Christmas Day. E-retail analyst IMRG predicts Christmas Day online sales will top £350 million and Boxing Day sales top £540 million. A record 16,000 local convenience stores – or 32 per cent of the total – are expected to open on Christmas Day, according to the Convenience Store Association. They include large chains such as Budgens and Spar. Diane Wehrle, marketing director for Springboard retail analysts, expects many more local shops to open on Christmas Day in the future, and predicts that in ten years Britain will have the lifted the ban on Christmas Day trading. Currently shops bigger than 3,000 sq ft are not allowed  to open. She said: ‘We are a multi-cultural society and while it’s Christmas for many people, for others it’s not a day of any particular significance. ‘Some people need to work and get along with their normal lives and that means being able to buy a few household items. ‘It’s handy for everyone. We have a 24-hour economy and you can’t close it down for one or two days, things have to carry on.’ The Citizens Advice Bureau warned against shoppers borrowing beyond their means by taking out payday and other  high-interest loans. A spokesman said: ‘Christmas is a time of giving, but you don’t want to give yourself a headache in the New Year with bills and debts you can’t afford. ‘It’s all too easy to overspend – there are tempting offers and pressures to buy – but you must decide how much you can afford before you start spending.’ The police are planning a  Boxing Day blitz to thwart gangs and pickpockets aiming to target the traditional post-Christmas sales. The offensive, known as Operation Nutcracker, will see teams of undercover police mingling with crowds on the streets, buses and trains. About 100 uniformed beat officers, mounted officers and a police helicopter are also involved. Four million Britons will be spending the holiday in sun spots abroad or on the ski slopes, and  a further eight million will be  taking breaks in this country. Customer's spent £30,000 per second on Saturday, but that is expected to rise to £45,000 on Monday making it the busiest day in British retail history . Furby Boom! V Teksta robot: .

Sony's Playstation 4 sold a million consoles on the first day and has been in high demand ever since . The iPad Mini 2 has experienced some supply issues with bosses warning not everyone will be able to find one . Since it went on sale in November, supplies of the iPad Mini 2 (from £219)  have been limited. Even Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook has admitted  that ‘it’s not clear that everyone who wants one will be able to find one’ this Christmas. The PlayStation 4 (from £349) has been flying off the shelves since selling a million consoles on its first day. Alex Ferguson V Bridget Jones: . Page turner: Alex Ferguson's autobiography will make the perfect gift for any Red Devils fan while Helen Fielding's latest Bridget Jones offering has also been selling well . The former Manchester United manager stormed the non-fiction charts with My Autobiography (£12), his account of life at the Red Devils, while the eagerly awaited next instalment of Bridget Jones’s Diary has taken top spot  in the fiction category.

Archbishop Justin Welby has been silent on the issue of shops opening on Christmas Day along with many other senior church figures . The Church of England’s most senior . leaders have failed to criticise the growing commercialisation of . Christmas Day – despite predictions that people will spend a record . £350 million online on the day itself and more shops than ever will . open. The Archbishops of . Canterbury and York and the Bishop of London all declined to respond to . questions last week about whether commercial pressures were eroding the . spiritual values of one of the most important days in the Christian . calendar. Only a . handful of bishops replied to a Mail on Sunday survey. The reluctance to . speak out follows predictions by the retail organisation IMRG of a 15 . per cent jump this year in the amount spent in the online sales on . Christmas Day, up from an estimated £307 million last year. On top of this, a record 16,000 independently owned shops will open. Judging . by the 107 million visits made to online retail sites last year, the . numbers of people shopping on Wednesday will dwarf even more the numbers . attending a Church of England service, which in 2011 was just over 2.6 . million. The Mail on . Sunday contacted almost all of the Church’s 42 senior bishops over . recent days, but spokesmen for the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin . Welby, the Archbishop of York John Sentamu and the . Bishop of London Richard Chartres said they did not wish to comment. Among . those who did respond, the Bishop of Norwich Graham James said: ‘It’s a . pity if this one opportunity to rest from retail is eroded. It won’t do . our spiritual health any good at all.’ The . Bishop of Chester Peter Forster said the traditional association of . Christmas with peace ‘should encourage everyone to avoid the commercial . activity – just as, traditionally, armies did not continue fighting on . Christmas Day’. The . Bishop of Wakefield Stephen Platten added: ‘Let us do our best to retain . at least one day in the year when as many people as possible can be . given a proper break and hopefully also reflect upon the deepest aspects . of our existence.’ The . Bishop of Bradford Nick Baines said: ‘The Beatles got it right: ‘Can’t . buy me love’. The loss of shopping-free days – a sabbath – is serious . for the good of individuals, families and communities.’ And the Bishop  of St Albans Alan Smith said: ‘The true message of Christmas is about giving.’","Monday is set to be the busiest day in British retail history .
