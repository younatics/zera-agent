"By . Jennifer Newton . Scientists say they have found a potential cure for motor neurone disease, which could be in clinical trials as early as next year, it was revealed today. Researchers from the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience hope that their ground-breaking research could lead to a cure for one of the forms of the disease, which affects more than 5,000 people in the UK, including Professor Stephen Hawking. It is also hoped that the research will help develop a way of screening people with a family history of the condition and fixing any faulty gene before symptoms begin. It is hoped the research could lead to a cure for the type of motor neurone disease that affects 5,000 people in the UK, including Professor Stephen Hawking, pictured . Professor Mimoun Azzouz, leading Gene Therapy Scientist and Chair of Translational Neuroscience, said: 'Quite simply this is a devastating disease, patients suffering from motor neurone disease can die within one or two years in the most severe cases, and lose all ability to use muscles, including arms and legs. 'It can prevent them from having a normal life and there is no treatment at all for this. 'Some of the cases are genetic, caused by a faulty gene called called SOD1. We are devising a strategy to take out the faulty gene. 'The breakthrough, if this a success, will be huge because there is no treatment for this syndrome. Because it is genetic, if patients can be screened for the gene, because of family history, then we can intervene even before the symptoms appear and rescue them. It can be a cure.' The professor added that he hoped the treatment would begin clinical trials by 2015. He added: 'We plan submission for regulatory approval by August 2015, for permission to take this therapy to patients in the clinic. It will be in clinics as a clinical trial at first, then if that is a success we would look to make it available for patients after that.' Professor Mimoun Azzouz hoped the treatment would begin clinical trials as early as August 2015 (file picture) Until now, all available treatments and drug-trials conducted across the world have failed to effectively halt the progression of the condition. Riluzole, the only drug that has demonstrated a survival benefit, prolongs life for just three to six months and may not be effective in all patients. But Prof Azzouz said he was confident that this research would be a success. He explained: 'Because we are targeting the causative gene, based on the previous studies that we have done, there's a very good chance that this can be a success. 'We are in an advanced programme looking at MND in childhood and in babies, and it's cause is not because of a faulty gene but it is in fact totally absent. In our programme we are using a virus carrier to attempt to restore the gene back. 'For example, in a mouse model the mice that had the disease would survive two weeks maximum from birth. But when we treated these mice we seen that they survived for nearly 400 days, so you can see the strength of this strategy.'","Scientists say the potential cure could be in clinical trials by next year .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Yvonne Doyle, who has been ordered to pay back £107,000 after illegally claiming £250,000 in benefits she was not entitled to . A fraudster stole a dead child's identity and pretended to be a vicar to claim £250,000 in benefits she was not entitled to. Yvonne Doyle conned the Department of Work and Pensions and Milton Keynes Council for 20 years and has been ordered to pay back £107,000 by a judge at Reading Crown Court. The 64-year-old was jailed for seven years in December after stealing a dead four-year-old's identity, using the name of Carol Ann Naylor, who died in 1951. She also posed as a vicar named Reverend Naylor and took on the alias of Bridgette Meally, who died in 1999, to make the claims. She was convicted of five counts of possession of an identity document, (an improperly obtained UK/Irish driving licence/passport) with intent, four counts of obtaining services by deception, one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception and eight counts of benefit frauds against the DWP and Milton Keynes Council, totalling £265,388 between 1990 and 2010. Today the mother-of-two, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, was ordered to repay £107,584 from her husband’s bank account within six months or serve an extra two years imprisonment. All the money recovered will be returned to the victims as compensation. During her trial, the court heard that Doyle refused to appear before magistrates at an earlier hearing in January 2011, instead sending a letter claiming she was subject to a fatwa which had led to the 'trumped-up' charges against her. She claimed the charges against her were fabricated and wrote: 'The alleged amounts have been manufactured and this was done in order to give the false appearance of high value crime.' Doyle added: 'I do not believe I will get a fair trial due to the involvement of Jews and Freemasons. 'In 1988 a fatwa, for want of a better word, was declared on me by the chief Rabbi of South Africa.' The fatwa was behind the charges, she claimed. Scroll down for video . The 64-year-old was jailed for seven years in December after stealing a dead four-year-old's identity, using the name of Carol Ann Naylor, who died in 1951 .

Doyle was branded 'clever, manipulative, bold and wholly dishonest' by prosecutors during her trial. Detective Inspector Gavin Tyrrell, from Thames Valley Police, said: 'The Thames Valley Police Asset Recovery Team is determined to remove assets from convicted criminals who benefit from their crime. 'This case shows that anyone convicted of acquisitive crimes will be pursued for their assets irrespective of where they are held. 'This confiscation legislation is powerful legislation for law enforcement agencies that where criminal assets are identified they can be used to repay victims of crime and we will continue to use it in this way.'","Yvonne Malone illegally claimed £250,000 in benefits over a 20 year period .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A hapless driver saw her car written off after she parked it on a beach and it became submerged by the incoming tide. The female tourist left the Ford Focus on the sand while she went to visit Brean Down fort in Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset. But while she was gone, the vehicle became engulfed by the incoming tide. After parking her Ford Focus on Brean beach in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, a female tourist returned to find it had been engulfed by the incoming high tide . Beach warden Dave Furber tried to search for the owner to warn her that her car was in danger but he was unable to find her before the high tide complete surrounded her vehicle. He added that the driver, from Devizes in Wiltshire was 'shocked' to come back and find that her car had been deluged. And now he is warning of the dangers of parking cars on the beach when the tide is approaching. He said: 'This serves as a warning about heeding warning signs and checking tide times before driving on to the beach.' Beach warden Dave Furber had tried to search for the owner to warn her that her car was in danger . So far this year, five other vehicles have also come unstuck in the same area of Burnham-on-Sea. In May, another Ford Focus became submerged in water after it was left on the beach, while the owner and his family went for a walk on Brean Down. On the same day, a Ford Mondeo also got stuck in the incoming tide. In April, a Vauxhall Tigra had to be rescued by the beach warden after the owners parked the car on the beach and then went for a walk. The incoming tide then complete surrounded the vehicle but luckily the car was driven away before coming completely submerged. After being almost submerged by the incoming water, the car ended up being written off . Also that month, a family returned to their car, which had been parked on the beach, to find it submerged in water after the tide came in. And a  month earlier, another car had to be freed by a tractor after it was driven on to mud on the beach and became stuck. The car, containing the driver, his partner and child had to be pulled free after calling for help from the beach warden.","Female tourist left her car on the sand at Brean beach in Burnham-on-Sea .

"By . Jennifer Newton . and Andrew Levy . Tomas Kanaporis has come forward to claim that the mystery man, pictured, is his missing brother Alvydas . A man found wandering in a park two months ago unable to remember anything about himself asked the public to identify him last night. Staff at the hospital where he is being cared for have called him Robert, but say his memory has  not improved since he was found on May 18 in  Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. He is thought to be in his twenties, and is an accomplished basketball player. He speaks English with an eastern European accent and understands some Russian and Lithuanian. Dr Manaan Kar Ray, the clinical director of acute care at Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust who has been monitoring Robert, said such extreme amnesia usually only lasted a few hours and was typically caused by a traumatic event ‘such as torture or a natural disaster’. He added: ‘I have been a psychiatrist for 15 years and I have never seen anything like this. 'It’s like something out of the movies. ‘There are very few clues for us to go on. 'The only thing we know is that he does have an interest in playing sports. We asked him if he liked basketball and he said he didn’t know what that was. 'But when we took him to play with other people he picked up the ball and knew exactly what to do.’ Robert said: ‘The last few weeks have . been truly horrible. I go through so many emotions. At times I am angry, . frustrated, depressed, lost and confused. ‘I just need to find out my name and I hope someone out there will recognise me and help.’ Robert, . who is 5ft 9in, weighs 13 stone and has dark hair and blue eyes, was . not carrying a mobile phone or any identifying documents when he was . found in a confused state. In . 2005, an accomplished musician who became known as the Piano Man was . found wandering in Kent. He remained mute for four months in hospital . but was accused of being a hoaxer after remembering he was Andreas . Grassl, a 20-year-old German. The man named 'Robert' by hospital staff was found in a park near a bus station in Peterborough on May 18 and is currently being treated at the Cavell Centre at Peterborough City Hospital . Experts believe he may be Eastern European and say he appears to have a talent for basketball and could be a football fan as he was wearing a Champions League watch when found . Robert is currently at the Cavell Centre at Peterborough City Hospital, where experts are trying to help him regain his memory. But nearly two months since he was found there has been no improvement in his condition. However, Robert’s doctors say they have one clue to help him remember his lost life - his apparent talent for basketball. Medics asked the mystery man if he liked the sport but he said he had never heard of it. But when Robert was thrown a basketball he knew exactly what to do and ran rings around the competition. He has also been playing football and tennis with fellow patients at a mental health unit on the outskirts of Peterborough. Doctors believe Robert is also a football fan because he was wearing a Champions League watch when he was picked up by police. Consultant pyschiatrist Dr Mannan Kar Ray, left, is treating Robert and says he has never seen an amnesia case as severe as this . But he has not watched a single World Cup match and has no idea which team he supports. Dr Kar-Ray added: 'There are very few clues for us to go on. 'When he was found he was wearing a watch with Champions League written on it, so that would suggest he is a football fan. But he hasn’t watched any of the World Cup and he has no idea what team he supports. 'The only thing we know is that he does have an interest in playing sports. 'We have taken him into Peterborough town centre to see if that triggers anything, but with no success. 'We’ve also taken him to Eastern European groups but no one recognises him. 'At the moment we are drawing a complete blank.' Cambridgeshire Police say the man is not known to police and does not match any missing persons reports.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . and Daily Mail Reporter . and Jennifer Newton . Arthur hit Canada's Maritime provinces Saturday with near-hurricane strength winds and torrential rains, knocking down trees and leaving more than 200,000 customers without power. Canadian Hurricane Centre spokesman Chris Fogarty said that winds were easing, but more rainfall is predicted for already drenched southwestern New Brunswick. Arthur was downgraded from a hurricane to a post-tropical storm Saturday morning by the time it reached Atlantic Canada after swiping a day earlier at North Carolina's Outer Banks, but it still packed a punch.

Working together: Military from Shilo work to fill and load sandbags in Portage La Prairie, Manitoba, on Saturday . Responders: Bombardier Jonathan Kaiser and others work in Portage La Prairie . Environment Canada measured wind gusts topping 72 mph (116 kph) in Halifax, while more than 4 inches (11 centimeters) of rain had already fallen on parts of southwestern New Brunswick. At 3 p.m. ADT (2 p.m. EDT, 1800 GMT) Saturday, Arthur was 28 miles (45 kilometers) southwest of Moncton, New Brunswick, with maximum sustained winds of 62 mph (100 kph), the Canadian Hurricane Centre said. Late Saturday morning, Nova Scotia Power said 113,000 of its customers were without power. The utility in New Brunswick reported almost 100,000 outages by mid-afternoon. It warned some residents they could be without power for up to 48 hours because of widespread damage caused by the storm. NB Power said the largest number of outages was in Fredericton where winds of more than 62 mph (100 kmh) had knocked down a number of large trees. Police in Saint John, New Brunswick, said some local roads were closed because they were covered by flood water. The storm also caused flight cancellations and delays at the region's largest airport in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Prince Edward Island said a number of electrical poles had been knocked down by the storm and roads were blocked by downed trees. The Canadian Hurricane Center said the storm would end in the Maritimes overnight and then track northeast through the Gulf of St. Lawrence toward Newfoundland on Sunday.

In the United States, North Carolina's popular beach towns began returning to the business of recreation Saturday, after Arthur lashed the state's coast with forceful winds and heavy rain and then churned northward without leaving a trail of significant damage. New England was largely spared from damage spawned by the storm, but some 19,000 people in Maine and 1,600 in Vermont were without power after high winds and heavy rains pounded the region. There were reports of localized flooding in coastal areas of Massachusetts and the Nova Star Ferry suspended service Friday and Saturday morning because of dangerous seas. No injuries or deaths have been reported. The hurricane's effects in North Carolina were mostly confined to Hatteras and Ocracoke islands, and some vacationers were already back on beaches to the north and south on Friday. But the ocean churned by Arthur remained dangerous Saturday with the risk of rip currents able to wash the strongest swimmer to sea. That didn't stop thousands of people from enjoying the sun and sand and leaving lifeguards to remind beach-goers of the danger. 'We're going to try to keep people out of the water and keep them safe,' said David Elder, lifeguard supervisor for the town of Kill Devil Hills. 'However, if conditions abate, I'd be glad to drop' the no-swimming warning. More than 600 of the 700 lifeguard rescues by Elder's department last year were required because of rip currents, he said. The only road onto Hatteras Island was reopened to all traffic on Saturday afternoon, hours after permanent residents were first allowed to return. The island had been closed to visitors since early Thursday. With many weeklong cottage rentals running Saturday to Saturday, local businesses were hoping to salvage the second half of the holiday weekend.

A small section of fragile North Carolina Highway 12 buckled after being submerged by churning waters during the Category 2 hurricane. Officials also tested the two-mile-long Bonner Bridge onto the island to ensure it was safe for traffic. The road also suffered extensive flooding in some areas and officials warned drivers to watch for pockets of sand on the highway. Farther south, Ocracoke Island's electricity distribution system was badly damaged by Arthur, leading officials to order residents to quit using air conditioners and water heaters so that generator-supplied power could provide refrigeration and other necessities during a cycle of planned outages. A nightly curfew between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. was declared until power was fully restored. Vacationers were being coaxed to leave with the offer of free ferry rides out. Parts of Rodanthe and Salvo were flooded on Friday across nearly the entire width of Hatteras Island from the ocean to the sound. Trailers toppled in campgrounds where they were left, pictures from a Coast Guard helicopter that flew over the island showed. Josh Fiscus was still cleaning up the mess at his Salvo home Saturday. 'We had about two feet of water here in my garage,' he said. Jackson Whitley, 14, was back to another day of picking up wind-blown debris and fallen tree limbs from around his family's Buxton home much as he did Friday. Apart from the lack of normal summertime crowds, he said streets were pretty much back to normal. Linda Savage, 65, said she and a neighbor collected a small refrigerator and a trash can with lid intact left behind by flood waters about three feet deep. The flooding rose almost to the front door of her Salvo home without seeping inside, but Arthur's winds of almost 100 mph caused other damage. 'I lost a tremendous amount of shingles from my roof,' Savage said. She planned to shop for groceries Saturday, and hoped the cable television and Internet would be restored soon.

Tens . of thousands evacuated the barrier island chain and fled inland ahead . of the storm. There were no deaths and few injuries reported, and . McCrory even attended a parade in Southport. Jesse and Carol Wray could see outside their home in Salvo on North Carolina Highway 12 that the road was submerged under several feet of water Friday morning. The six-foot-tall lamppost at the end of their driveway was under water except for its top, and that was after the sound a quarter-mile away receded several feet since first light, said Jesse Wray, 68, a retired Norfolk, Virginia, firefighter. 'I'm surprised that it got this bad. There's all kind of debris floating around here. I know a lot of people who lost their houses around here' if they were built on the ground instead of elevated, Jesse Wray said. Wray's home is on pilings nine feet off the ground and avoided water inside. This incredible image shows swirling Hurricane Arthur from high above Earth in the International Space Station . Camper trailers were tossed around like toys by the flood waters that gushed across much of the Outer Banks Thursday night . Almost 20,000 people were without power this morning as the storm came ashore late last night, shortly after being upgraded to Category II . About seven . miles south on the island, Frank Folb, 70, said his brick home on a . rise in Buxton suffered no damage. Tomato plants in his garden were . twisted and broken, but 'overall it's not bad,' he said. 'I've been . losing electricity but I slept through the night pretty well.' Paul . Wernock said water about 3 feet deep surrounded his Rodanthe, North . Carolina, home but was receding early Friday. 'We have one giant mess' from tree damage and debris, but no obvious structural damage to homes . on his side street, he said. Four cruise ships were also diverted to avoid the path of the storm.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A drunk couple went on a rampage and beat up a social club secretary and his wife at a wedding reception after they flew into a rage after he burst balloons near their sleeping daughter. Mother-of-three Sarah Etchells, 43, began ranting at 76-year-old Harold Foulkes after he burst the balloons near the child while he was cleaning up after the reception at the Railway Club in Farnworth near Bolton, Greater Manchester. Although he apologised, the argument descended into violence when Mr Foulkes and his wife Eileen, 75, were set up on by Etchells and her husband Nick, 52, as the elderly couple tried to take staff home. Harold Foulkes was left with a number of injuries from the attack including bruising to both eyes, severe facial swelling and bruising, a cut top lip and a cracked tooth . Sarah Etchells, left and Nicholas Etchells arrive at Bolton Crown Court where they admitted assaulting an elderly couple . Mr and Mrs Foulkes were beaten during the melee before Mrs Etchells climbed into their car through the rear door where three women, including a pregnant barmaid were sitting. Mr Foulkes was punched in the face knocking off his spectacles and hearing aid. He also suffered bruising to both eyes, severe facial swelling and bruising, a cut top lip and a cracked tooth. His wife suffered a large bruise to her left temple and other minor facial injuries while the pregnant woman sustained a three-inch scratch to her chest. Today a judge branded the Etchells’ behaviour as 'disgusting' as they admitted violence and public order offences. Mrs Etchells of Farnworth wept as she pleaded guilty to three counts of common assault and criminal damage and was given a 12 month community order and was ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid work. Her painter and decorator husband and another man Dale Hughes, 27, a fork lift truck driver also of Farnworth, were found guilty of one count of assault following a trial and were each jailed for 18 months. Harold and Eileen Foulkes were both beaten during the melee, which also caused around £400 worth of damage to their car . Bolton Crown Court heard how the the incident took place in August 2013 after the wedding reception at the Railway Club in Farnworth and the Etchells - who married in 2012 - were invited as guests. The court heard that Mr Foulkes would often help at the events and was assisting at the function with about 100 people present. Trouble began at about midnight as the celebrations began to wind down and Mr Foulkes began to pop balloons during the clean-up as they had previously set the club alarm off. Mrs Etchells castigated Mr Foulkes for waking up her daughter and further trouble occurred outside when the party were seen to behaving loudly. As the club has a sign up outside asking customers to be quiet, Mrs Foulkes - who brought food to the club for her husband - politely asked the Etchells to keep the noise down. But the drunken mother punched the elderly woman in the face while Mr Etchells set about the victim’s husband punching him in the head and face, causing his nose to bleed. Fearing they wouldn't stop, Mr Foulkes got into the car and tried to drive off with his wife and the other members of staff inside. However, punches continued to reign down on the man through the open window of his car and he felt trapped as he had his seatbelt on and could not move, rendering him helpless as he was repeatedly attacked. One of the other women in the car got out, at which point Mrs Etchells got into the car and assaulted the pregnant woman, pulling her hair and scratching her chest despite pleas to leave her alone because she was pregnant. Eventually Mrs Etchells got out of the car and the police were then called. Nicholas Etchells, left, was sentenced to 18 months in jail for the attack, while Sarah Etchells received  a 12 month community order and was ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid work . A dent to the door of the car caused by Mrs Etchells’ tirade was estimated at £400, but the loss of Mr Foulkes’ hearing aid - and the replacement - was valued at £3,600. Defending Sarah Etchells, Huw Edwards accepted she was drunk and behaved ‘appallingly’, but said she had three children under 17 and is the sole carer for her 82-year-old grandmother. But sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Timothy Hamman said: 'This was a disgraceful act in which two elderly people were attacked without reason when performing an unpaid service of running a social club which had been used to host a wedding where you were all guests. 'It must have been terrifying for them and for the three bar staff waiting to be taken home. 'Sarah Etchells, you started it. For a married woman with a child who was present looking on your behaviour was as bizarre as it was disgusting. You should be ashamed. I watched you sat through your husband’s trial without showing any glimmer of emotion or embarrassment at your appalling behaviour. 'Nicholas Etchells you were drunk and agitated. Dale Hughes you were prepared to lend yourself and involve yourself in an angry confrontation. Dale Hughes, who was also found guilty of one count of assault following a trial and was jailed for 18 months . 'Sarah Etchells you attacked an elderly woman at night in a large group and played a leading role by starting it. You attacked an elderly victim and you each played a significant and leading role in what was a combined attack.' After the hearing PC Joanne Boyle of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The facts of this appalling case speak for themselves and serve as a sad indictment of what can happen when loutish behaviour and alcohol are mixed, becoming a violent cocktail that results in innocent, hard-working people being harmed. 'This man is an upstanding member of the community who kindly gives up some of his free time to help out at the club. Both he and his wife show the sort of community spirit that is to be admired, so to therefore be the victims of such sustained violence is absolutely shameful. 'There was no provocation for what happened, no excuse or justification for attacking an elderly couple who were simply helping out at a function to such a brutal and appalling attack. 'To add to that, a pregnant woman was also harmed despite her pleas that she was with child. Thankfully the unborn baby was not injured but clearly the potential for serious harm was there, making this an even more cowardly and shameful act. 'If there is any positive message to come from this sad case, it should be in the form of a warning to people attending these sorts of functions were alcohol flows freely. 'I would hope in the cold light of day these people regret attacking two pensioners and a pregnant woman, and that if they go back they would not allow alcohol or anger to cloud their decision-making.'","Harold Foulkes burst the balloons while cleaning up after wedding reception .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Ukraine has refused to call a truce with pro-Russian rebels vowing to end their bloody insurgency with force unless they lay down their arms. Ukrainian forces have scored a string of surprise military successes since the weekend that forced most of the militias to retreat to the sprawling eastern industrial hubs of Donetsk and Lugansk. The Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has now ordered his troops to blockade the insurgents inside the cities and cut them off from any further arms supplies. A local resident in the eastern Ukraine city of Slavyansk speaks to Ukrainian servicemen sitting on top of their tank . Tanks and armoured personnel carriers have been patrolling the streets of Slavyansk today after the city was recaptured from pro-Russian rebels . Troops also stood guard outside the front of Slavyansk city hall today after the defence minister said Ukraine would not negotiate with pro-Russian rebels . The unconditional stance reflects a new confidence in Kiev and comes as they are on the verge of quashing the uprising. This is despite EU leaders pushing for a diplomatic solution to the conflict as well as Russia own efforts to force Ukraine to make compromises to preserve the east of the country's links to Moscow. Defence minister Valeriy Geletey said in a statement: 'Now, any negotiations are possibly only after the rebels completely lay down their arms.' The president made an unannounced visit to Slavyansk, a former rebel-held city reclaimed by Kiev on Saturday and said that talks with the uprising's commanders were impossible because most were now hiding in Moscow. Mr Poroshenko told reporters that he would only speak to 'the real masters of Donbass - the steel workers and miners' in the conflict zone.

Meanwhile separatist leader Valeriy Bolotov claimed that his men had managed to actually push back Ukrainian troops from parts of Lugansk and had received fresh supplies of anti-aircraft and artillery guns. The Ukraine's message to the rebels will now mean Russian president Vladimir Putin faces a tough choice between dealing a blow to Russia's economy by further boosting support for the rebels or seeing his own popularity suffer by taking no action at all. Germany's Berenberg Bank economist Holger Schmieding said: 'He may either have to step up his support for the pro-Russian insurgents who are now on the defensive or he may be seen as letting Ukraine advance on the ground in Donbass. 'The former could trigger more serious sanctions and further capital flight from Russia. The latter could hurt his popularity and his 'strongman' image in Russia where (he) had whipped up nationalist sentiment in the last five months.'

Meanwhile the U.S. has consistently backed the campaign waged by Ukrainian troops since the Ukrainian president promised to quickly quash the uprising after his election in May. The United States views Ukraine's territorial integrity as vital to European security and important to halting Russian President Vladimir Putin's seeming ambition to resurrect a tsarist or post-Soviet empire. US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki reiterated on Monday that 'the government of Ukraine is defending the country of Ukraine, and I think they have every right to do that.'","Ukraine government refuses to call a truce with pro-Russian rebels .

Millions of Americans came out in force to celebrate Independence Day - and even a hurricane couldn't stop them. Hurricane Arthur, the first storm of the Atlantic hurricane season moved away from New York and towards New England Friday as it was downgraded from Category II to a Category I, and most people on large cities along the seaboard refused to let the storm dampen their Independence Day enthusiasm. The hurricane, initially forecast to drench New York, fizzled out before it ever got going. The showers were predicted to last until at least 9pm, but never amounted to more than a drizzle.

'I'm surprised that it got this bad. There's all kind of debris floating around here. I know a lot of people who lost their houses around here' if they were built on the ground instead of elevated, Jesse Wray said.

"By . Associated Press . and A. Greg . One of five Minneapolis teenagers charged in the death of a classmate from a synthetic drug overdose has pleaded guilty to third-degree murder. Cole A. Matenaer, 19, of Woodbury pleaded guilty to providing a designer psychedelic drug similar to LSD that killed 17-year-old Tara Fitzgerald on January 11, just hours after she took it. She was a Woodbury High School junior. Four others also face third-degree murder charges related to the sale and distribution of controlled substances. Scroll down for video . Guilty plea: Cole A. Matenaer, 19, will be sentenced in October after pleading guilty to third-degree murder in the death of 17-year-old Tara Fitzgerald . Loss: Tara Fitzgerald died after taking a synthetic drug similar to LSD in January . Prosecutors say they were part of a Washington County drug-dealing chain. The Star Tribune reports that the substance, known as 25i-NBOMe, is sometimes called N-Bomb or Smiles. Matenaer is scheduled to be sentenced in October. Fred Fink, head of the criminal division in the Washington County attorney’s office, says a prison sentence of 74 to 103 months is likely, though the judge has discretion. Others charged with third-degree murder in Fitzgerald’s death were Sydney C. Johnson, now 18, of Woodbury; Alistair C. Berg and Brian P. Norlander, both 17 and of Woodbury; and Alexander L. Claussen, 19, of St. Cloud. Drug death: Tara Fitzgerald died the morning after taking a synthetic drug known as Smiles . The younger three, who will be classed as adults in court, are also facing a felony charge of selling dangerous drugs to a person under 17. The charges were made as Woodbury police traced the supply line after Tara died from a fatal overdose of a synthetic form of LSD known as 25i-NBOMe. Tara . Fitzgerald, a talented student and musician, died in her parents' home . in January, after taking the drug during a sleepover. 'When an illegal drug enters our . community, all of those involved - those who create it, sell it or give . it away - are responsible for what happens with that drug,' county attorney Pete Orput told the Star Tribune. Johnson, Berg, Norlander and Matenaer are accused of buying and selling the LSD, and Claussen is accused of being the supplier. Police said 305 doses of the drug were found in his home. Norlander is accused of selling the drug to Tara after a chain of sales involving the other defendants. According to the police complaint seen by Twin Cities, Claussen sold it to Matenaer at the end of 2013. Matenaer sold the drug to Johnson, who sold it to Berg. Charged: Alexander Claussen, left, and Cole Matenaer, right, both 19, are two of the five teenagers facing third-degree murder claims over the death of Tara Fitzgerald in January . Promising: Tara, 17, was described as a good student who loved making videos . Norlander allegedly bought it at the end of December, and is accused of selling the synthetic LSD to Fitzgerald around January 4. After her death, Orput said: 'It's the worst thing that can happen to all of us. We've got to do something about this.' Tara had been described by her school principal as an 'excellent student and a valued member' of the school community. She had enjoyed making amusing videos and skateboarding, and liked listening to British bands. 'She was not a big party girl. She was a leader, witty, with a sense of humor,' Bill Hedahl, who used to coach Tara for a softball team, said. Arrest: Five teenagers are facing third-degree murder charges in connection with Tara's death . Woodbury police chief Lee Vague defended the decision to charge the teenagers in connection with Tara's death. 'These . are smart kids knowingly selling what they think is LSD. They're making a pretty poor choice,' he said. 'If you make a choice and that . choice results in the death of a young girl, you're going to be held . accountable for that.'","Tara Fitzgerald, 17, died after taking a synthetic drug similar to LSD during a sleepover .

"By . A. Greg . and Associated Press . It's been 31 years since Sid Wells was shot execution-style in his own home in Boulder, Colorado and his terminally ill mother has yet to see his killer locked up. The 22-year-old University of Colorado student had been dating Robert Redford's daughter Shauna Redford for three years at the time of his death, and she was so devastated by the loss that she dropped out of college. 'I don't know that I'll live long enough to see a resolution in this case, but I would hope that I can, and I've never given up hope,' she told CNN. Young love: Shauna Redford and Sid Wells had been dating for three years when he was killed . Heartbroken: June Menger is now terminally ill but hopes to live long enough to see police apprehend Thayne Smika . Wells' mother June Menger says Redford is like a daughter-in-law to her, even though she never saw her son married. Boulder police are still looking for Thayne Smika after a murder warrant was issued for his arrest in . 2010. Wells' brother . found his body August 1, 1983, in Wells' Spanish Towers condominium. An . autopsy showed Wells was shot execution-style at point-blank range in . the back of the head with a 20-gauge shotgun. The case attracted worldwide media . attention when Redford halted production of The Natural, being filmed on . location in Buffalo, N.Y., and came to Boulder for Wells' funeral. Wells . and Redford's daughter Shauna, then 22 years old, were both students at . the University of Colorado and lived in the same building. Smika, who was often late with rent, was supposed to pay Wells the day he was killed, investigators said. Police . suspected Smika, Wells' roommate, and arrested him a few months after . investigators said they linked him to the murder. Smika was never . prosecuted because the district attorney at the time declined to take . the case. Smika left the area, and in 1986 his abandoned car was found in Beverly Hills, California. Wells' mother, June Menger, said that Boulder investigators have been dogged in their work to solve the case. Victim: University of Colorado journalism student Sid Wells, 22, was gunned down August 1, 1983, in his condominium . Suspect's many faces: Boulder police released (clockwise) murder suspect Thayne Smika's original mugshot and a series of age-progressed sketches showing what he might look like now with glasses and facial hair . Warrior: Wells was part of the university's Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps . Senseless loss: Wells aspired to be a journalist, was a dedicated student and had many friends . She said she isn't bitter about the delays in getting a murder warrant. Prosecutors at the time of the killing lacked the evidence techniques that have since allowed detectives to link shotgun pellets recovered from Wells' body to shells found at the Smika family residence in Akron, Menger said. She said Robert Redford and her son were friends, and they went jogging and skiing together. She said Redford initially decided not to attend the funeral, worried it would become a media circus. But he came anyway because of his close friendship with Wells. ‘He said it had turned into his nightmare too,’ she said. Redford said in 1997 that Wells' murder still haunted him. ‘It's like a partially opened door with a very dark room behind it,’ he said. Horrifying scene: Sid's brother discovered the 22-year-old's body in his Spanish Towers condo . Grisly: Autopsy showed Wells was shot execution-style at point-blank range in the back of the head with a 20-gauge shotgun . Prime suspect: Smika, Wells' roommate, was arrested a few months after the murder, but he was never prosecuted because the district attorney at the time declined to take the case . In 2010, the Boulder County district attorney's office agreed to review the case and approved an arrest affidavit for Smika. But authorities could not find him. Smika's bail was set at $5million after the warrant was issued. Boulder Deputy Police Chief Dave Hayes, one of the first detectives to investigate the case, said Smika may have become assimilated into a community and he hopes new coverage of the case will lead a neighbor or a relative to step forward. ‘It's time for justice,’ said Hayes, who has remained in touch with Wells' family over the last three decades. Thayne Smika, who is believed to be living under an assumed identity, would be 54 now. Police released his 1983 mugshot and an age-progressed image of what he might look like today. True friend: Robert Redford, pictured comforting his weeping daughter, initially decided not to attend Wells' funeral, worried it would become a media circus, but he came anyway . Bereaved: Shauna Redford dated Sid Wells for three years, was his best friend, and in his obituary she was listed among his survivors . In 1997, a police officer posing as a journalism student talked to Smika's mother, who said her son had changed his name because he was afraid for his life because he knew who the real killer was. An aspiring journalist, Wells also was part of the university’s Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. For his first date with Shauna Redford, the two went to an ROTC dance, the site Daily Camera reported. Shauna, the daughter of Robert Redford and his first wife, Lola Van Wagenen, whom he divorced in 1985, dated Sid Wells for three years, and in his obituary she was listed among his survivors. Moving on: Shauna, pictured left with her actor-director father in 1997, went on to marry journalist and best-selling author Eric Schlosser (right), and the couple have two children . A photo that accompanied a 1983 Associated Press article about Wells’ funeral showed the weeping young woman being comforted by her father on their way to the service. Following the murder, Shauna went on to marry university professor Eric Schlosser, the best-selling author of Fast Food Nation. The couple have two children, a boy and a girl. Police believe Thayne Smika could be hiding in Mexico or California under an assumed identity.","June Menger, the mother of murdered 22-year-old college student Sid Wells, hasn't given up hope police will find his killer .

"By . A. Greg . CNN is reportedly being sued following a biting incident involving one of its Emmy award-winning reporters at the U.S. Embassy in Iraq last month. Arwa Damon, 36, a Beirut-based correspondent, is accustomed to sinking her teeth into juicy stories - but this time, she allegedly became 'seriously intoxicated' at the embassy in Baghdad in July and bit two EMTs. TMZ reports that Tracy Lamar and Charles Simons, EMTs working for a private contractor in Iraq, say Damon chomped into each of their left arms as they tried to help her. More than she could chew: Arwa Davis, a respected journalist who covers the Middle East for CNN, allegedly bit two EMTs in a drunken rage . Top reporter: Arwa Damon speaks four languages and was recently awarded the Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women's Media Foundation . According to the lawsuit obtained by TMZ, Lamar and Simons say they were trying to help the drunken journalist when she became belligerent. The medics were called to calm the correspondent after she became 'totally out of control,' reports the New York Daily News. She allegedly tried to deter them by attempting a 'don't you know who I am?' tactic, telling them she was a 'major reporter for CNN,' but when this failed she became physically violent. 'She was biting them both pretty furiously. She has good teeth. Eventually they subdued her,' David Jaroslawicz, an attorney for Simons and Lamar, told the Daily News. The suit claims she bit both Lamar and Simons on their left arms. Simons says his knees and elbows were also injured, and Lamar says she sustained bruising in the attack. The suit claims that CNN was aware Damon had a history of drunken aggression, and was even known to be violent when sober, reports TMZ. Write caption here .

"By . A. Greg . A fixture of New Jersey Republican politics and her husband have been found dead in their home in an apparent murder-suicide. Police have not publicly identified the couple who were found Thursday morning, but the Arden Road home belonged to retired Morris County clerk Joan Bramhall and her husband John Bramhall. The Star Ledger reports that sources close to the investigation have confirmed the couples' identities. Recently retired: New Jersey Republican fixture Joan Bramhall is believed to have been found dead along with her husband John Bramhall in their home . Joan Bramhall, 75, had been a fixture in . local Republican politics and retired in December 2013 after serving as . county clerk for 15 years. The couple had four children together but lost one, and also raised four of their grandchildren. Police were dispatched to the property after a relative reported a person found deceased in the home at 10am Thursday. Officers then found a second body in the house. According to the Daily Record, one daughter-in-law of the couple was staying at the home but was not present at the time of the deaths. Police released a statement saying that a male and female in their seventies had been found dead in the home. They said the investigation is in its preliminary stages but that 'there is no indication...that there is any threat to the community.' No further details were given. Joan Bramhall had been a longtime member of the Morris County Republican Committee and served as its chairwoman from 1988 to 1994, and worked alongside present Governor Chris Christie as a freeholder from 1993 to 1998. John Bramhall had owned a construction company which was responsible for many of the large homes in the couple's neighborhood, reports the Star Ledger. 'It's a damn tragedy. God, she just retired. She had done so much - county clerk, chairwoman of the Republican Party, a great supporter of me as I was of her,' Senator Anthony Bucco told the Daily Record, adding that he'd just seen Bramhall a month ago. Family home: The couple were found in their Arden Road home after police received a call from a family member . He said she'd told him that she and her husband had travel plans for their retirement and that she'd hoped to go to Alaska. Other friends and former colleagues were equally shocked and distraught. Assembleyman Michael Patrick Carroll said Bramhall was incredibly kind and helpful to him when he began in politics in the 1970s. 'She was a great lady, everybody's friend. She never had an ill word about anybody,' Carroll told the Star Ledger. 'At the end of the day, if you could stay serving the people in the state of New Jersey for basically 50 years, even somewhere as relatively civil as Morris County, and never piss anyone off, that says a lot about your personality.' When she announced at the age of 74 in January 2013 that she would not run for a fourth term as county clerk, Bramhall said she was looking forward to her retirement. 'You know when it's time to stop and I want to stop and smell the roses, so to speak,' Bramhall said, reports the Daily Record.","A couple were found dead in their New Jersey home Thursday morning .

"By . Associated Press . and A. Greg . The Connecticut mansion that belonged to millionaire Leona Helmsley is on the market for $65 million after a three-year renovation. The woman who's perhaps best known for leaving her entire fortune to her Maltese terrier Trouble was dubbed the Queen of Mean for cutting off her grandchildren and heaping her fortune on the pampered pooch. The mansion known as Dunnellen Hall is on 40 acres in Greenwich with distant views of Long Island Sound. On the market: The mansion where Leona Helmsley lived and died is now on the market for $65 million . Queen of Mean: Helmsley earned the nickname when she cut her grandchildren from her will and let the millions to a Maltese called Trouble . The Greenwich Time reports that the mansion features an entry room with an elevator and limestone walls and flooring, a 45-foot living room, a library, nine bedrooms, and a game room. The hotel owner and real estate baroness served 21 months in prison for evading federal taxes by billing her businesses for mansion renovations. Helmsley died in the mansion in 2007 at age 87 leaving $12 million to her beloved dog. A judge later knocked the figure down to $2 million. The funds remaining after Trouble's own demise in 2010 reverted back the the Helmsley family trust, which supports various charities. The current owners bought the mansion in 2010 from the Helmsley estate, but owned it for less than a year before putting it on the market. Downsized: Several wings have been removed from the sizable house, as well as three swimming pools and a marble dancefloor . 'Light and warm': The home used to be 'like a museum' says the estate agent, but now it's much more homely . Storied past: The home has been home to a shipping magnate, a Yankees owner and was even briefly home to actress Lana Turner . It failed to sell, so they undertook the three-year renovation that actually involved making it smaller by removing some of the wings of the house. 'There's a complete new energy to this house,' Jane Howard Basham of David Ogilvy and Associates told The Greenwich Time. 'Before it felt like a museum. It was impractical. It was cold. But now I could see a family with kids running around in it. It feels like a real home. There are windows everywhere, natural light everywhere. It's very light and warm.' In the renovation, a service kitchen, rooms for staff and three swimming pools were removed. An audio-visual system and new landscaping were added. A marble dance-floor that Leona Helmsley had installed over the pool was also removed.","Dunnellen Hall in Connecticut is back on the market after three years for $65 million .

"By . Wills Robinson . Jailed: April Piercy, 45, stole £54,00 from the Essex GP surgery she managed in a bid to fund her live and online bingo addiction . A GP surgery manager who stole almost £54,000 from her practice to fuel a bingo addiction has been jailed. April Piercy from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, earned £66,000-a-year, but generated huge debts by blowing £140-a-day on both live and online versions of the game. To fund her habit, the 45-year-old started signing false invoices from locum doctors at Great Clacton Medical Partnership. Trusted executive Piercy started the scam in 2001 and carried on betraying her colleagues at the cash-strapped surgery for the next three years. She was jailed for 14 months at Chelmsford Crown Court yesterday after she admitted fraud by abuse of a position of trust. Sacha Bailey, prosecuting, said her crime had a huge impact on her practice, which had been struggling financially. She read a personal impact statement from Dr Ildiko Spelt, a partner at the surgery, saying she was still battling to tackle the impacts of her crime. Dr Spelt said: 'I relied 100 per cent on April to run the practice so I could focus on my patients.' Evelyn Hicks, defending, said Piercy had become depressed after both her parents died in the early 2000s and was often burdened by the troubles of colleagues who would confide in her. Mrs Hicks said Piercy owed a lot of money, including mortgage arrears, meaning her house was about to be repossessed. She said the gambler had generated around £100,000 worth of debt and faced losing her home. Mrs Hicks said: 'She played bingo five times per week and that became her lifestyle. The practice was in dire financial difficulties. She has added to it, she has not caused it.' She said Piercy was now living on benefits after losing her well-paid job. Judge David Turner, QC, told Piercy: 'This is a tragic day for you. The fact is you have derailed your life, and the sad reality is you have made extremely bad choices for an intelligent person. 'You were someone who was completely trusted, looked at as having commitment and energy, and were paid a decent salary. 'You were not as perhaps well supported personally and you sought solace in what became an addiction to gambling.' Scam: Piercy signed false invoices for locum doctors over three years at the Great Clacton Medical Partnership in Essex (pictured). She was jailed for 14 months at Chelmsford Crown Court . He added: 'It rather took over your life and you wasted much of the monies which you were stealing. 'By raising the bogus invoices you covered your tracks consciously and deliberately and knowing with every one you sent out you were doing something wrong. Your conduct was protracted but out of character. 'I don’t doubt it has left you stressed, depressed and ashamed, and added to the difficulties you have with isolation. 'I hope you manage to survive this sentence and put this tragic and shameful incident behind you and with the help of your friends pick up your life.' No order was made for compensation as a separate Proceeds of Crime Act hearing is set to be held next month.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Associated  Press Reporter . A Michigan man was fatally mauled by two dogs as he jogged along a rural road on Wednesday evening. Craig Sytsma, 46, of Livonia was attacked by the cane corsos in Metamora Township, about 45 miles northwest of Detroit, authorities in Lapeer County said. He was unconscious when he was taken to a hospital, where he died of his injuries, police said. The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from the same property, officials said. Scroll down for video . Attack: Two cane corsos attacked Craig Sytsma . Help: A neighbor reportedly witnessed the attack before he tried to shoot at and scare the dogs off . 'He was jogging, doing what everybody else does out there, running and riding bikes,' Metamora Township police Officer Sean Leathers told the Detroit Free Press. According to police, a man mowing his lawn nearby saw the attack, got a gun and tried to shoot at the animals to chase them off. In Michigan, a person may face involuntary manslaughter or other charges in such an attack. The county prosecutor's office is expected to review the case. The dogs, previously identified as bull mastiffs, were quarantined at the Lapeer County Animal Shelter. Sheriff's Detective Jason Parks told the Detroit Free Press the dogs' 45-year-old owner brought them in and authorities will seek to have the dogs destroyed. Sytsma was a 'a divorced father of three' and 'had apparently decided to jog after leaving work,' the newspaper reported. WXYZ reported that Sytsma survived a battle with colon cancer last year. 'He was very competitive,' said friend Mark Raitanen who knew him for 23 years and spoke to the Detroit Free Press. Raitanen said he jogged, played hockey, and golfed, as well as regularly riding his mountain bike and playing beach volley ball. A huge music fan who was partial to Santana, the Allman Brothers, and Gov't Mule, he went to several shows a year but still listened to cassette tapes. Scene: Sytsma was running on this road when he was mauled by the two dogs . But more than anything he was a family man who cherished his children Tyra, 16, Jordan, 23, and Luis, 28. 'He was a dad, he was a family man,' Raitanen said. Son Jordan said that while his father fought cancer at the age of 23, he would rarely speak of it. 'I’d . say, ‘I’m here for you, Pop,’ but I wouldn‘t ask questions,' Jordan . Sytsma said. In May 2012, there was a report of a . dog bite where the animal returned to the same property, Metamora . Township Police Chief David Mallett told The Flint Journal. And in November 2013, a man was taken to a hospital after being bitten by a dog that returned to the address. Mallett told the newspaper he didn't know whether the same dog or dogs were involved. Victim: April Smith, pictured, was attacked by one of the dogs in April 2012 . The dogs 'get loose kind of regularly,' Geoffrey Petz told the Flint Journal. 'I've had interactions where I was walking out of my grandma's pole barn and there was a dog standing there with its hair standing up, growling at you,' he told the newspaper. 'When you get that feeling, you can see it in an animal if it's scared or aggressive and you just back right back into the door.' Oxford resident April Smith told the Free Press, however, that one of the dogs involved on Wednesday attacked her in May 2012. Smith said she and her sister were walking two dogs when she was bitten. She said she was horrified that the owner still had the dogs. 'It's just crazy to me,' Smith told the newspaper. 'Animal control should have done something. It should have never gone this far. The fact this has led to a death, it's sickening.' Some people in past dog attacks in Michigan have been charged. A Livingston County woman whose American bulldogs in September 2007 fatally mauled two people, including a 91-year-old man, was sentenced to prison in 2008. She pleaded no contest to two felony counts of keeping dangerous animals causing death and a misdemeanor charge of allowing her dogs to stray.","Craig Sytsma, 46, of Livonia was attacked by two cane corsos in Metamora Township .

"By . A. Greg . A meteorologist for ABC affiliate WATE in Knoxville, Tennessee recently received some rather unwelcome fashion advice from an elderly viewer in a handwritten letter. The letter tells Julya Johnson that while she's a 'great meterologist [sic],' she would get a lot more compliments if she didn't wear 'those high bodice dresses.' The letter-writer left no return address, so Johnson posted the letter on her Facebook page along with a polite but firm response to the advice therein. Weathering the storm: Julya Johnson says that after 12 years on-air, she's realized she'll never please everyone with her appearance . Unsolicited: In a letter apparently penned at 2am, an 'elderly person' told Johnson not to wear dresses that 'fight snugly' under her bust . The letter begins by complimenting Johnson at her proficiency at her job but quickly gets to the point: Johnson's appearance. 'Please change your appearance!' reads the letter from someone who describes themselves as an 'elderly person.' 'Do you Have any dress or dresses that don't fit snugly under your (Bust)? Please! You are Beautiful – But you need a change,' it goes on. Johnson, rightfully, was annoyed at the unsolicited fashion advice. Accurate forecast: Julya Johnson says that if she knew people would value her more for her appearance than her work she could have saved a lot on her meteorology degree . 'Does the fact that I bring an accurate forecast mean nothing? I was a straight A student. If I had known being on People's list of ""best dressed"" mattered more than an accurate forecast, I could've saved a ton of money on that meteorology degree,' she writes. The WATE meteorologist has been on-air for 12 years and says she's tried to change herself to please other people before, and that she's realized it's pointless. 'I will never, ever be able to please everyone with my appearance,' she writes. 'I have ""changed my appearance"" to try to please people before. It never works. So, I please myself. I like my dresses. I feel good about my appearance. I am always covered, dressed modestly and professionally.' As Julya Johnson points out, commenting on other people's appearance is 'very rude.' Viewer letter: . Hello Julia [sic], . You are a great meterologist [sic]! I am at [sic] elderly person who depends on WATE 6 News for my daily news and weather – my daily beginnings – I watch this news from 2 a.m. – thru the day. I observed every one gets great compliments about their job, How they give great forecast [sic]. There are not any compliments about you! Why? Please change your appearance!! Those high Bodice dresses are Not (for) you. Do you Have any dress or dresses that don't fit snugly under your (Bust)? Please! You are Beautiful – But you need a change. Please don't feel like I'm putting you down. Allow me to apologize. This letter is meant for the beautiful lady you are. Go forward (Be happy!) Julya Johnson's response: . So, it's not fun to wake up to things like this. No return address was left, so I'll address it here. I will never, ever be able to please everyone with my appearance. It's not possible. I have tried for 12 years on-air to do that. I have ""changed my appearance"" to try to please people before. It never works. So, I please myself. I like my dresses. I feel good about my appearance. I am always covered, dressed modestly and professionally. Yet, she mentions that I am a great meteorologist! And she also says I get ""no compliments""? Does the fact that I bring an accurate forecast mean nothing? I was a straight A student. If I had known being on People's list of ""best dressed"" mattered more than an accurate forecast, I could've saved a ton of money on that meteorology degree.Don't do this, people. Just don't.

"By . Daniel Mills For Daily Mail Australia . A man claims he was left with a 2cm gash in his face after being punched by his neighbour, a celebrity eye doctor, because grass clippings were left on his driveway. Former model Tom Mitchell, 31 was allegedly struck in the face by Allan Ared on Saturday night and told he 'was going to die', the culmination of an 11-month feud. Mr Mitchell and his wife Kelly were watching a movie at home in Hurstville Grove, southern Sydney, when Dr Ared and his wife Simone knocked on their door about 8.45pm. Mr Mitchell received four stitches under his left eye on Saturday night when he was  allegedly hit by Dr Ared . Tom Mitchell, left, sporting the wound after he was allegedly punched in the face outside his Sydney home by Dr Allan Ared (right) on Saturday night . 'They were saying, ""what the hell, you white trash, scum bags, have some common courtesy and clean up the grass clippings"",' Mr Mitchell said. ""You're going to get over here and clean this s*** now"".' Mr Mitchell alleges he was punched in the face by Dr Ared, who was clenching a key in his fist. 'He (Ared) was there circling back and forth - they were both up for it,' he said. 'They said their cousins wanted to pay us a visit and have it dealt with that way.' Tom Mitchell and his wife Kelly claim they have been been targeted by the Areds in ongoing petty neighbourly disputes . Mr Mitchell said he was accused of deliberately leaving the clippings on the driveway, so he went and inspected them himself. When he told them they were acting ridiculous and to 'p*** off home,' that's when he 'felt this massive smack in the face'. 'I was left with this cut a couple of centimetres long,' he said. Daily Mail Australia has attempted to contact Dr Ared, a former radio host on 2GB and a Sydney optometrist, but he has not returned calls. Police charged Dr Ared with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and confirmed that the Mitchells had filed an AVO application against him and his wife. Mr Mitchell - who has modeled for clothing label Burberry - said it was not the first time that he and his wife have been confronted by Areds since moving to the area last October. Before the couple even had time to settle in, they were in the crosshairs of their neigbours who demanded they not park on the street at the front of their home because it obscured their view. 'We told them that we weren't going to do that because we are entitled to,' Mr Mitchell said. The pair alleged they were hosed down by Mrs Ared and had the washing on their line repeatedly soaked.

"By . Wills Robinson . Jeremy Smith, 45, was convicted of raping a woman at a swinger's club Halloween party following a nine-day trial at Sheffield Crown Court . A cabaret performer is facing jail after he was found guilty of raping a woman at a swingers' club while dressed as Herman Munster. Jeremy Smith, 45, was part of male cabaret team performing at a Halloween party at La Chambre in Attercliffe, Sheffield, when he attacked the woman in a room of mirrors. He was found guilty following a nine-day trial at Sheffield Crown Court and will be sentenced in September. The married father was dressed as the character from The Munsters while his two friends were dressed as Harry Potter and Herman’s wife in drag. The 22-year-old victim, who was at the club with two friends, said she only went to the club to socialise and never indulged in sexual activities. Charlotte Baines, prosecuting, said the victim and her friends had been plied with wine by the cabaret performers before they went to watch other people have sex in the upstairs playrooms. She later became separated from her friends when Smith persuaded her to go into a mirrored smoking room. He began to kiss and grope her before he pulled down her underwear, according to the prosecution. As he undid his trousers the woman 'froze' and he lifted her onto his lap and had sex with her as she tried to move him away. The woman told the court: 'My body just went into shock. I was just completely frozen. I was really rigid and tense.' She went on: 'Just because of where it was it doesn’t mean that gave him the right to do that to me. 'I didn’t give him any indication I wanted to have sex with him that night. He shouldn’t get away with what he’s done.' She told the police as she was being raped she thought: 'He was really, really tall and big in his platform soles. I thought My God where are my friends.' She locked herself in a toilet and complained to management and Smith was later arrested.Smith claimed any sexual activity was consensual. He said the woman had been flirting with him and they were getting on well.

"By . Wills Robinson . Staff at one of Marco Pierre White's gastropubs have allegedly staged a walkout in protest over the chef's 'bossy management style'. A group of 'frustrated' employees at the Pear Tree Inn in Whitley, Wiltshire, are said to have resigned in quick succession, apparently forcing the venue to turn customers away. But the manager has denied the claims and says they are telling guests to go elsewhere because the venue is undergoing refurbishment. Walkout: A group of employees at the Pear Tree Inn, Whitley, Wiltshire, are said to have left the restaurant in quick succession in protest at Marco Pierre White's (right) 'bossy management style' The famous chef bought the pub in 2011, but locals quickly became 'upset' with the changes he made, and some shunned it for being too pricey. Customers who have booked rooms are apprently being sent to a nearby hotel and tables can’t be reserve - but a spokesman for the venue claimed the restaurant is only shut for a quick refurbishment. Local councillor Terry Chivers, who has been drinking at the pub for more than 20 years, said around 15 members of staff walked out in the past few weeks. He said: 'It has been a down hill struggle since he [Marco] took over to be honest. He has gone through about eight or nine chefs in the last year. 'It is because they are not allowed to run the how they think it should be run. But the final straw came two or three weeks ago and most of the staff resigned en masse, basically because he wouldn’t let them manage. They just got frustrated. 'I understand the chef that was there left yesterday. He took most of the staff with him. I walked up there today and I said to the manager ‘what the hell is going on?’ 'He’s a great guy but he’s there by himself. He said ‘well, I put my notice in and I’m leaving in two weeks time’. There is nobody there to run the place. 'When I was up there there was a Spanish couple there. He was there trying to explain ""we can’t take you because we’ve got no staff"".' A member of the kitchen staff who left the pub two years ago, but worked under ‘Pierre White’s reign’ said there have always been problems. He told Mail Online: ‘By the end of my time there, it was a horrible place to work. ‘It was always up and down. When he first turned up it was really good, but after the novelty wore off it just dropped. The standards weren’t great. ‘The head chef that was brought in and was having to train someone new every week because of the turnover of staff. It just didn’t go well at all.' He explained that 16 and 17-year-olds would be talked down to while they worked and, by the end, some of them ‘just couldn’t take it’. White bought The Pear tree in March 2011 with business partner Paul Clark as one of six pubs from The Maypole Group which went into administration. He was slammed for removing all draught lagers from the bar and stocked just one bottled lager costing £4.20 a bottle. Cider drinkers had to make do with a super strong 7.3 per cent drink, but the menu had more than 40 red wines, with the top bottle costing £139. Allegations: The venue - which was bought by the chef in 2011 - has allegedly been forced to turn away customers as 'only one manager remains' - but staff claim it is just because of refurbishments . Reaction: Residents in the Wiltshire village 'shunned' Marco Pierre White's 'posh' food when he took the venue over in 2011 . All pub snacks were removed with customers being pointed towards the 'posh' menu for food, and one of the eight rooms at the hotel cost between £70 and £170 a night. Customers who have booked rooms at the venue are being sent to one of White’s other hotels - the Rudloe Arms in Corsham, Wiltshire. Mr Chivers added: 'Marco doesn’t realise what’s going on. He lives in a bit of a dream world. And he won’t let the staff manage. 'The staff know what the locals want but Marco won’t let them. I’ve heard the place is losing £2,000 a week - that’s just the rumours though.' But manager Duncan de Jager denied the place had lost its staff, defended his boss, and said customers were only being turned away because of a refurbishment. He also said some younger members of staff had left to go to university. Mr de Jager said: 'I’ve got a lot of respect for Marco, so it’s not my place to really say anything. I am leaving but I’m going on to my own career, I just want to take on something by myself - that’s the only reason behind me doing it. Response: The manager has denied the claims - and says they have a 'full brigade' working at the restaurant and said the head chef had moved on because he was offered another job . Interior: The venue in Whitley, Wiltshire, has a bar, restaurant and eight en-suite rooms . 'I’ve been working for Marco for coming on five years, which is a long time at one place, and I want to take on my own thing.' He denied the staff has resigned en masse, or that he was the only staff member left, and added: 'We’ve at full brigade here. 'Yes the head chef has moved on, but that has been happening for some time really, we’ve been expecting it for a while. 'He is a very talented chef and he got offered a job in a restaurant where he can write his own menu.' He said around ten members of staff remained and when asked about people being turned away to the Rudloe Arms, he said: 'We’re doing a refurbishment at the moment. We are refurbishing the kitchen and some of the rooms.' Marco Pierre White has been contacted for comment. 'Shunned': Rainbow Inn, Cooksbridge, East Sussex . When Marco Pierre White opened the Pear Tree Inn in 2011, locals were said to have been upset. Now staff have allegedly walked out because of the management style. However the chef's restaurants have been at the centre of controversy before. In 2012 those living near The Rainbow Inn in Cooksbridge near Lewes, East Sussex, did not eat at the pub after the restaurateur took over because they believed it was too posh. Customers reportedly rejected his new menu after he replaced traditional dishes like bangers and mash with delicacies including poussin a la chipolatas and pomme fondant. Earlier this year, health inspectors allegedly found raw and cooked meat mixed together, filthy surfaces and poorly trained staff when they visited his flagship restaurant in Birmingham. The four-star Marco Pierre White Steakhouse Bar & Grill in The Cube was given a zero food hygiene rating from environmental health officers earlier this year. It was revealed that inspectors found examples of cross-contamination at the premises including raw and cooked food being stored together and the same equipment being used for both. The management were, as a result, ordered to carry out a thorough clean of the surfaces and equipment at the restaurant and train staff on food hygiene and hazard assessment. In 2010, the Yew Tree Inn in Highclere, Berkshire, a pub he co-owned with proprietor Andrew Parton, was fined £30,000 for polluting a stream with sewage. Neighbours complained after the Yew Tree Inn released the waste into a nearby stream. A court heard that the pollution amounted to a 'serious and continuing' environmental problem. The restaurant pleaded guilty to five counts of polluting a water course between November 27, 2007 and January 15, 2009. Parton also pleaded guilty to five similar charges during the same period.","Chef bought the Pear Tree in Whitley, Wiltshire, in 2011 and upset locals .

"By . Wills Robinson . The BBC has signed Phil Neville for this season's Match Of The Day - despite his 'monotone' performance in the commentary box at the World Cup. The former Everton and Manchester United star is joining show veterans Alan Shearer, Robbie Savage and Danny Murphy alongside other newcomers Ruud Gullit and Rio Ferdinand. The ex-defender revealed the news on Twitter, the site where hundreds of football fans slammed his punditry performance during England's opening fixture against Italy in June. Scroll down for video . Taking the mic: Phil Neville will be a pundit on this season's Match of the Day, despite heavy criticism for his 'monotone' commentary during this summer's World Cup . The 37-year-old posted: 'Delighted to join Match of the Day for the new season. Can't wait to get started with the team.' Neville admitted working as a commentator was 'harder' than he thought after 445 viewers complained about his on-air performance. Viewers criticised his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during the game with several Twitter users joking that England physio Gary Lewin who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle had actually 'fallen into a coma' listening to Neville. Making the announcement, BBC football executive Mark Cole said: 'After 22 years, Alan Hansen will no longer be with the show, but the World Cup really showcased the strength of the new BBC punditry team. New role: Neville spent the latter half of the last football season as the assistance to Ryan Giggs, Manchester United's interim manager . 'We will continue to evolve the Saturday night panel and feel we have a really good blend of regular studio guests. 'Delighted to join Match of the Day for the new season. Can't wait to get started with the team' Phil Neville . 'Alan . Shearer has established himself as one of the top pundits in the UK, . while Danny Murphy and Philip Neville will regularly provide added . tactical analysis. 'There will be strong opinions from Ruud Gullit and Robbie Savage, while Rio Ferdinand will continue to give excellent insight around his playing commitments. 'We will continue to mix our team of regular analysts with current players and managers, which featured Roy Hodgson, Thierry Henry, Vincent Kompany and Roberto Martinez last season. 'We are confident we have put together a varied team full of insight and opinion, led by Gary Lineker, who has consistently proved to be amongst the best presenters in the UK.' Comments: Some Twitter users today voiced their concerns over the potential quality of Neville's commentary and analysis, with one saying: 'I will have fallen asleep before it gets to our game' Some Twitter users today voiced their concerns over the potential quality of Neville's commentary and analysis, with one saying: 'I will have fallen asleep before it gets to our game'. 'Phil Neville is on Match of the day next season? Nooooo! I will have fallen asleep before it gets to our game' John Stones, Everton fan . Others predicted 'he's literally going to send people to sleep' and said 'he's a human sleeping pill'. Lawrence Thompson added: 'Phil Neville taking over Alan Hansen's spot on Match of the Day is almost as bad as David Moyes for Fergie. Sort it out BBC.' Some posted a short video of his commentary for Tim Cahill's stunning goal for Australia v Holland during the 2014 World Cup, which had the monotone sentence: ‘There's a cross, it's a volley, goal.’ In another change, the BBC also announced that the Football League Show will now be on Sunday morning on BBC2. Neville pictured playing for England in 2004 . Phil Neville was subject to a huge Twitter backlash during England's opening World Cup fixture against Italy because his commentary 'lacked emotion'. It was his first appearance behind the microphone - and was under heavy scrutiny by the 15million football fans who were watching. Several joked that England physio Gary Lewin who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle had actually 'fallen into a coma' listening to Neville. Ofcom received 445 complaints for his monotone commentary - forcing the pundit to defend himself. After the social media storm, he told Radio 5 live: 'I think the biggest thing I learned is that co-commentary is harder than what I thought it was going to be. 'I welcome all the feedback you get and it's a welcome to the social media so you come in after a game you're hyped up, its just like playing doing a co-commentary, you're focused for 90 minutes, you turn your phone on and you’re getting some lovely messages. He was even mocked by the police, with the South Warwickshire force’s official Twitter feed providing a string of safety advice based on his disastrous performance. They said: 'At least we know Phil Neville won’t stir the crowds in the pubs into a frenzy. Drink sensibly,' read one message, while another claimed officers 'will be playing recordings of Phil Neville all night to keep the streets all calm and sleepy'.","Ex- defender will star alongside likes of Alan Shearer and Robbie Savage .

"By . Wills Robinson . Maxine Ovenden, 39, accidentally overdosed on painkillers at her home in Ashford, Kent, after suffering constant pain from a gastric bypass operation (pictured after the surgery) A woman left in agony for years after having a gastric bypass died after accidentally overdosing on painkillers, an inquest has heard. Mother-of-one Maxine Ovenden, 39, spent most of her adult life battling her weight and had risen to 25 stone. Five years ago she underwent weight-loss surgery on the NHS and virtually halved her weight to 13 stone. But she suffered persistent agonising pains and medical staff struggled to diagnose what was wrong. She was found dead at her home in Ashford, Kent by her mother shortly before her 40th birthday last January - having taken an accidental overdose of painkillers. Her GP Dr Edward Klim told a coroner that Maxine had suffered from nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain since the gastric bypass. She underwent numerous tests and procedures in an attempt to find out what was causing the problems and was due to undergo an operation for an overlapped bowel. Her mother Dawn Sharp, 59, told the inquest in Folkestone, Kent, she believed Maxine’s death was an accident. She said: 'I think it was accidental. I think she just took one too many. She must have woken up, got the time wrong and taken one more.' The inquest heard Maxine had struggled with an alcohol problem and had been diagnosed with clinical depression, but had stopped drinking. In August last year she had fallen between 25ft and 30ft from a balcony onto a road, fracturing a bone in her face among other injuries. But Rachel Redman, coroner for central and South East Kent, accepted that she had started to 'take more responsibility for her life' since her fall. Before recording a verdict of accident death, Mrs Redman said Maxine was 'off the alcohol' and had 'everything to live for'. After the inquest Mrs Sharp, also from Ashford, said she wished her daughter had never gone under the knife. 'She had a gastric bypass and she was never right again' she said. 'It has to be something related to the gastric bypass. She was never in pain before that.' The mother-of-one, pictured left just after finishing school and right when she was aged 11, had suffered constant nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain following the gastric bypass operation . 'I wish she’d never had it. I wish doctors had said this is it and told her to go to the gym three times a week and you cut down food, but they didn’t.' She added: 'She always told me she’d rather be fat and happy than thin and unhappy. But I think when you’re big people are abusive sometimes, people get on at you.' Mrs Sharp said her daughter was turning her life around when she died. She said: 'She was nearly 40. She’d had a bad run up until then but her life had turned around and she was on the up. 'We’d booked a holiday, she’d moved to a much better area and was taking her daily exercise. She was on the up.'","Maxine Ovenden, 39, from Ashford, Kent, spent her life battling her weight .

"By . Wills Robinson . A father attacked his baby son in hospital while the little boy was being treated for  injuries he had inflicted in a previous violent outburst, it has been revealed. The child was taken to Rotherham District Hospital in South Yorkshire when he was less than three weeks old where medical staff found he had suffered severe head injuries and ‘forceful shaking’. While he was still being treated for his injuries his father attacked him again - leaving him with extensive bruising. Scroll down for video . Shocking: The baby boy, who was less than three weeks old, was being treated for head injuries in Rotherham District Hospital, South Yorkshire, when his father attacked him . Police are investigating the incident which took place in January, but no arrests have been made. The shocking details of the father’s violence against the child emerged as a family judge banned him from seeing his son - saying the baby would be in ‘real danger’ if any further contact took place. Judge Annabel Carr QC, sitting at Sheffield Family Court, said the injuries suffered by the boy could only have been caused by the father and it was ‘not possible’ they were accidental. After the initial outburst, the child had been unresponsive for about an hour, but the father did not take him to hospital - saying he didn’t know where it was - and waited for the baby’s mother to return home. The baby was initially treated for an infection, but scans revealed bleeding on the brain and social workers became involved after doctors suspected the infant had been assaulted. While he was still in hospital recovering from those injuries, the baby suffered further harm. The father called in a duty nurse as he was changing his son’s nappy and claimed he had ‘tripped’ on the wheel of a cot and dropped the baby face down on the bed. After demonstrating to the nurse how he had fallen, the father said: 'I cannot believe this has happened'. The judge said doctors were ‘deeply suspicious’ of both sets of injuries and, following extensive tests which ruled out natural causes, Rotherham Borough Council launched care proceedings. The council did not take any issue with the mother’s care and accepted she is a ‘concerned and loving parent’ who is capable of caring for the baby. During the family court hearing, the father’s version of events was ruled out by doctors, who said it was simply ‘not possible’. Medical staff also concluded that both sets of injuries could not have been caused by anything other than deliberately inflicted trauma. Judge Carr said the father’s evidence was ‘neither credible nor reliable’, adding that his failure to alert the mother sooner when the baby first fell ill was an attempt to cover up the harm the child had suffered at his hands. Civil case: Judge Annabel Carr QC banned the father from seeing the child at Sheffield Family Court, saying the child would be in 'real danger' if they were to remain in contact . She said: 'There can be no other explanation as only the father was present and therefore only he knows what happened. 'He left it to the mother and grandfather to raise their own concerns and to seek help for the baby, unaided by him. 'The only explanation is that these were inflicted injuries, as all the medical evidence now supports.' She found that both sets of injuries could only have been caused by the father and ordered that he should have no contact with the baby. The judge said: 'Those findings having been made, it makes any contact - supervised or otherwise - in the immediate future a very real risk and danger for the child. 'I have to bear in mind that, on the second occasion, this baby was in a place of safety yet came to be injured by severe bruising over his head and body, the explanation given by the father simply not being a possibility. 'As such, for the time being, there can be no safe contact between this child and the father.'","Infant was being treated at Rotherham District Hospital, South Yorkshire .

Trisha Rafferty, 45, was near her front door in Wigan, Greater Manchester when the blue VW Golf lost control and smashed into her family home while husband Stephen, 49, and son Sean, 22 were in bed.

Ruined: Trisha Rafferty, 45, arrived back at her home in Wigan Greater Manchester, her living room destroyed after a car smashed into the side of the house while her husband and son were asleep . She also described how her television had been flung across the room due to the impact of the collision, and was discovered lying upside down on the pile of rubble. 'I was out walking the dog and when I got back my son was outside,' Mrs Rafferty said. 'He just looked at me and said to have a look at the living room.' 'I went round and I saw the car was stuck in the wall on the gable end of the house. It’s just lucky that it happened at 5am when no-one was in the living room. If anyone had been in there who knows what would have happened. 'It’s a notorious spot for accidents so clearly something needs to be done about it.' Her daughter Sinead, 25, was working a night-shift at the time of the smash and Trisha described her relief that the crash happened when nobody was downstairs. She said: 'My husband Stephen told me he heard a really loud bang and that he felt the house shaking when it happened. Destruction: The fireplace caved in during the impact and the television was flung across their front room . 'I couldn’t believe the damage it had caused when I went inside - it was so bad that the TV was on the other side of the room. 'The whole fireplace was demolished and needs rebuilding. The wall had collapsed on the inside and debris was been fired across the room. 'We’ve had the wall patched up just to get us by but the gable end needs a lot of work but we’ve got no idea how much it’ll cost.'

The city has 50,000 more individuals worth seven figures than in New York (319,700) and 110,000 more than in Tokyo (265,800). Scroll down for video . City of the rich: Research by New World Wealth shows London has retained its place as the dollar-millionaire capital of the world - with 36,600 more residents becoming millionaires in the last 12 months . They make up almost half of the 840,000 millionaires living in the UK - the third highest in the world behind the U.S. and Japan. In terms of multi-millionaires (those with assets over $10m), the study by financial specialists New World Wealth shows the capital lies third in the table with 9,700 - behind Hong Kong (15,400) and New York (14,300). Geneva in Switzerland has the highest proportion of millionaires, with one in every 12 residents  having worth more than $1m, followed by Zurich (one in 17) and Singapore (one in 22). Andrew Amolis, the head of research at Johannesburg-based New World Wealth, said London was attractive to millionaires because of the language and the international nature of the city. He also suggested that buying a house has been easier than in the past with the EU's open border policy allowing people to move to the city far more easily.

"By . Wills Robinson . The groom wore a scarf and fez, the bride donned a black lace dress - but the best man looked out of this world. When Paul and Joanne Seymour from Gravesend, Kent, decided to renew their vows after 30 years of marriage, they shunned the traditional ceremony and opted instead for a Doctor Who theme - with a Dalek as the best man. The service at the St Peter and St Paul's Church began with the couple, who had a white wedding at the same church in 1984, walking down the aisle to the show's theme music. From another universe: The Dalek bursts through the doors of St Peter and St Paul's Church in Gravesend, Kent, before Paul, 55, and Joanne Seymour, 52, renew their marriage vows . Kiss of death: The couple, who were celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary, pose with the cyborg (complete with a white bow tie) for a photo . In front of the 80 guests, they then pretended that Paul's brother Martin, the original best man, had lost the ring. Briefly after running out of the doors in a panic, the entrance was filled with a cloud of smoke - and a Dalek entered carrying the ring. The model - wearing a white bow tie - moved slowly down the aisle and was greeted by vicar Graham Herbert. He welcomed the Dalek to Earth before it turned and ordered the congregation to 'all show respect to the reverend'. Paul, 55, dressed Doctor Who-style in a long scarf, fez and carrying a sonic screwdriver, got on one knee and proposed again to Joanne who wore a black lace dress and Tardis hair ribbon. He told her: 'You look just as beautiful today as you did when I first met you and I wanted to ask you just one more time, will you marry me?' Threat: Reverend Graham Herbert welcomed the model into the church. The Dalek then turned to the congregation and asked them to show respect for the vicar . Pose: Paul and Joanne Seymour at St Peter & St Paul's church in Gravesend,  Kent with Reverend Graham Herbert - and the special best man . Joanne, 52, a senior midwife, said yes and Rev Herbert told them 'You may kiss - or else be exterminated.' Paul said the ceremony at St Paul's Church, Gravesend, Kent last Saturday took place after they offered to raise money for a local charity. The sci-fi fans also received a special signed photograph from former Doctor Who star David Tennant congratulating them on their special day. Paul, a maternity manager, said: 'We didn't really plan to do all of this. Invading the vows: The fictional cyborg stands next to the reverend and the couple, both dressed in Doctor Who-themed outfits as the ceremony gets under way . Plan: As the ceremony began, Peter's brother Martin returned to him, pretending he had forgotten the ring . 'Originally we just wanted to walk down to aisle to the Doctor Who theme tune but then when Jo bought me the Dalek for my birthday, well, this all happened. 'The Dalek was actually an actor in a costume, I don't think the guests were expecting it. 'It's definitely something to remember. 'The vicar was a bit sceptical about it, particularly the Dalek as it's the epitome of evil but thankfully that all worked out. 'When we spoke about doing it for charity, he was up for it and even let us split the collection plate from the ceremony.' The couple, who share their home in Erith, Kent with three cats, are now auctioning off their hundreds of pieces of Dr Who memorabilia for charity. They hope to raise £2,000 for Little Buds Fund for special care babies at Darent Valley Hospital where they work. Appreciation: The guests clapped and took photos as Peter got down on one knee and reconfirmed his love for his wife . Paul added: 'Joanne and I have always been huge fans of Dr Who, even before we met. I remember watching it as a kid.' Joanne said: 'I can remember I used to hide behind the couch when I was a child watching Dr Who. I've always been a fan. 'It was an amazing wedding and I'm glad we decided to do something different.' After the ceremony the couple had a party complete with tardis table decorations, Daleks and Cybermen. They originally met on a blind date when Joanne was a trainee midwife and Paul was an undertaker. Rev Herbert said: 'They're great science fiction fans and that love of sci-fi is part of their marriage. Grand entrance: The Dalek, with a purple glow emanating from the bottom, hovers down the aisle . 'They wanted to raise funds for the Little Buds fund at Darent Valley Hospital and so I was happy to do something for them. 'I've never had a wedding quite like this.' A Darent Valley Hospital spokesman said: 'We wish Joanne and Paul the very best of health and happiness as they continue their adventures in space and time together. 'Reaffirming their vows in front of their family, friends and at the point of a Dalek blaster was a delight to see and hear. 'Paul made a wonderful Doctor Who at his wedding but there was no mistaking who is the Master.'

The HMS Portland sailed into Devonport Naval Base in Plymouth, Devon, yesterday after it was rumoured that Commander Sarah West, 41, had a relationship with married Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray, 35. Around 600 family members waved at the crew who gathered on the deck as the ship rounded Devil's Point before docking out of sight. Sex scandal: The HMS Portland returned to dock yesterday at the Devonport Naval Base in Plymouth, Devon, following rumours the ship's commander had a relationship with a crew member on board . Greeting: Crew members wave to the camera as they return home following a seven-month deployment . Alleged affair: Commander Sarah West, 41 (left), and Lieutenant Commander Richard Gray, 35 (right), are said to have started a relationship during the ship's seven month deployment . Welcome home: The vessel's crew members lined the ship's dock as they were greeted by family members on their return . Reception: Families hold up banners to welcome their loved ones home as they sail into dock . The alleged affair is being investigated, and if claims are proven Commander West could face a formal warning, reassignment or even termination of her two decades of Navy service. Lieutenant Commander Gray - who married wife Melissa, 33, just five weeks before he set sail - may also face disciplinary action. HMS Portland set sail in January on a seven-month deployment undertaking maritime security operations, including counter narcotics and anti-piracy patrols.

"By . Wills Robinson . Two cowboy builders have been jailed for completing £5,000 worth of unnecessary renovations on an elderly man’s home - and charging more than £100,000. The 69-year-old victim from Lewisham, south east London, was forced to hand over all of his life savings and take out a series of high-interest loans after he was targeted by the three rogue traders, who bombarded him with 300 calls in three months. Leader Patrick O'Driscoll, 40, and an unknown associate first approached the man while posed as friendly builders ‘Steve’ and ‘Tony’, first convincing him  he had a leaky roof. Rogue traders: Patrick O'Driscoll, 40, (left) and Damien Foley, 48, were jailed for performing unnecessary renovations at the an elderly man's home in Lewisham, south east London, and overcharging him by £95,000 . After carrying out the pointless work O'Drsicoll and his accomplices Danny Haygreen, 28, who was also jailed, and Damian Foley, 48, told the retired man his home needed more work. It included new doors, stairs and re-plastering - the total cost of which should not have exceeded £5,000. But the sick gang bombarded the unnamed victim with hundreds of phone calls at all hours  over three months last year, where they managed to convince him to hand over £94,000 for the work on his home. The old man was so worried about his spiralling debts that he was about to sign the deeds of his home over to the gang in order to get them off his back. The scheme was only discovered when a concerned bank manager notified police - and when Haygreen turned up to collect another £7000 from the man’s home, he was arrested. Further investigation revealed the gang had also taken £16,000 from an 82-year-old man in Twickenham, south west London, and £37,000 from a 93-year-old man in Kensington. In his victim impact statement, the 69-year-old victim from Lewisham, said: 'I feel the people who did this to me are the sort of people that should be put away for a long time. 'I think that if police had not got involved they would not have stopped demanding money from me.' The three men were convicted and sentenced on Friday at Woolwich Crown Court. O’Driscoll, of Potters Bar, north London, pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to defraud, and was sentenced today to five years in prison. Foley, from Finchley, north London, pleaded guilty to three counts of money laundering and received a 19-month sentence. Haygreen, from Hatfield, Herefordshire, was handed a nine-month suspended sentence after admitting attempting to obtain criminal property. He is not pictured because his punishment was less severe. Investigating officer Detective Inspector Rob Fisher said: 'This group handpicked victims who lived alone and had a trusting nature. Guilty: The three men were sentenced on Friday at Woolwich Crown Court. A statement on behalf of the victim said if the police had not intervened, the gang would have carried on demanding money . 'Having convinced them that they needed work done, the group besieged the victims with phone calls, both to earn their trust and land them with increasingly extortionate debts. 'Their control over their victims was deeply disturbing. When we intervened, the victim in Lewisham was considering signing over the deeds to his house in order to settle the bill. 'He had also been convinced not to talk to anyone else about the supposed building work. 'The men had instructed him to only talk on the phone if the caller identified themselves as ‘Bravo One’, after which he had to identify himself as ‘Bravo Two’. 'The victims feared debt and they feared these men, who were aggressive and unrelenting in their pursuit of cash. 'It will be a long time, if ever, that the victims’ faith in others is restored but I hope that the conviction and sentencing of this unscrupulous group will at least help them begin to feel safer.'","The 69-year-old victim had to hand over all of his life savings to builders .

"By . Wills Robinson . Swindled: Thelma Idahosa, 29, from Bromley, south east London, used fake credit cards to pay for a range of cosmetic surgeries at Harley Street clinics . A mother-of-two who used six cloned credit cards to pay for cosmetic surgery at Harley Street clinics has walked free from court after being convicted of fraud. Thelma Idahosa from Bromley, south east London, spent £8,500 on a number of procedures and even asked for a refund when she complained not enough fat had been removed during a liposuction. The graduate, 29, forked out thousands for surgeries on her thighs, stomach, arms and ‘love handles’, as well as skin-tightening procedures, using 'stolen credit card details'. She was given a six-month suspended prison sentence at Woolwich Crown Court and was told she would have been jailed if it had not been for her young children. She spent £4,000 at the Harley Street Skin Clinic and then purchased £4,500 worth of treatment at the West One Clinic - where she even demanded a £1,000 refund after only three litres of fat was removed instead of six. Described as 'incredibly rude and aggressive', Idahosa - who was seven months into another suspended sentence at the time of the fraud - she phoned the clinic 'shouting and ranting', threatening to visit and cause a scene. The company suffered an additional loss after agreeing to refund her two sums of £500. Prosecutor Mr. Arizuna Asante told the court on Friday: 'Other people’s identity came into play when the cards were preferred for payment. This was fraudulent from the outset and consisted of multiple frauds.' Idahosa was seven months into a two-year suspended sentence when she committed the frauds in May and June, 2012. Recorder . Michael Wood QC told the mother-of-two: 'You really should be going to . prison. 'There is only one reason you are not and that is because you . have a relatively young child. 'A sentence of imprisonment that would amount to weeks or months is outweighed by your child’s rights. Scroll down for video . 'However, . you can’t hide behind your children forever and if you commit an . offence within the next two years you will go to prison whether you have . a babe in arms or are pregnant.' Convicted: The mother-of-two had liposuction procedures on her stomach arms and 'love handles' using the money from fraudulently obtained credit cards . Idahosa was almost certainly told the same thing when receiving her original suspended sentence seven months before the frauds. She . received six months imprisonment, suspended for two years, was placed . on a two-year supervision order and was told she must also complete 150 hours community service work. 'You are a very, very lucky woman,' Recorder Wood told Idahosa. Angry: Idahosa demanded a refund from one clinic because they only removed three litres of fat instead of six .

"By . Wills Robinson . The widow of poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko has said the 'whole world' will know the truth about what happened to her husband as a public inquiry was formally opened into his death today. Marina Litvinenko told reporters outside the Royal Courts of Justice it was a 'special day', adding that she felt positive the inquiry would begin on schedule next January. Earlier in the hearing, the inquiry's chair Sir Robert Owen praised the widow for her patience in the face of 'highly regrettable' delays. Her husband, who fled to Britain in 2000, was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea with two Russian men, one a former KGB officer, at the Millennium Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square in 2006. Scroll down for video . Statement: Marina Litvinenko, pictured left outside the Royal Courts of Justice today, said the 'whole world' will now know the truth about the death of her husband Alexander (right) After formally suspending the inquest into Mr Litvinenko’s death, Sir Robert opened the public inquiry. He told the hearing that alleged Russian state responsibility in the 43-year-old’s death was of 'central importance to my investigation'. Sir Robert explained that Britain’s responsibility for protecting the former KGB officer would not be investigated as there was no evidence to suggest any failings on the state’s part. However, he added that if evidence was discovered during the course of the inquiry to suggest Britain could have prevented his death he was able to bring the issue into the scope of the process. And Sir Robert explained that some of the inquiry would have to be kept secret and held in private. Progress: She added that she was 'confident' the inquiry will open on schedule next January . Success: The public inquiry, which formally opened in London today, was announced when Ms Litvinenko challenged opposition from the Government and the Home Secretary in the High Court . Submission: Ms Litvinienko did admit that some parts of the inquiry will remain secret and she may never know the content of some of the evidence . He said: 'Because of the sensitivity of Her Majesty’s Government’s evidence it is inevitable that at least some of my final report will also have to remain secret but I make it clear now that I intend to make public my final conclusions on the issue of Russian state responsibility together with as much as possible of my reasoning in that regard.' The Government had previously resisted launching a public inquiry, and instead said it would 'wait and see' what a judge-led inquest found. But Ms Litvinenko challenged this and the High Court ruled that the Home Secretary must reconsider the decision. An inquiry will allow investigators to probe whether the Russian state was behind the former KGB officer’s murder. Ms Litvinenko said the coroner had thanked her for her patience because of the amount of times the inquest had been delayed, but added: 'I believe genuinely 2015 it will start.' She added: 'Everybody around the world will know the truth.' Asked if she thought last week’s announcement was due to the strained political situation with Russia, she said the 'political situation' may have contributed to it, but she did not think there had been any 'political involvement' in the process. She added that she had always been aware parts of the inquiry would have to be in secret, and admitted she may never know the content of some of the evidence submitted to the inquiry. But Ms Litvinenko said she was reassured it would be viewed by the chair and other lawyers. Daily Mail comment .","Marina Litvinenko said the 'whole world' will now know the truth .

"By . Wills Robinson . A drunken Chinese man who was shot at point-blank range  survived because the bullet wedged in the smartphone he was carrying in his shirt pocket. Han Peng had been drinking with friends at a karaoke bar in the northern Taiwanese city of Hsinchu when he got into a fight with another customer and was suddenly fired at. The 47 year old was taken to hospital following the altercation, but only suffered a bruise and a small cut because the bullet was stopped by the phone's plastic casing. Lucky escape: Han Peng survived a point-blank range gun shot because the bullet became wedged in his mobile phone, which he was carrying in his shirt pocket . The row began when Han's friend spotted a wallet on the floor belonging to Hsu Shen, 48, and picked it up before shouting to everyone in the bar: 'The next round is on me.' Hsu failed to see the funny side, so he went over to the group and they started arguing. The confrontation quickly turned into a punch-up, prompting to Han intervene try and calm Hsu down. According to bar owner Li Fan, Han left the bar and came back 10 minutes later carrying a gardening sickle and marched across the bar towards Hsu. Li Fan added: 'Everyone was stunned when the other man pulled out a gun and fired it at point-blank range at the man waving the sickle. He added: 'I got the impression he only wanted to terrorise his rival and was really quite shocked when he was suddenly shot. He had turned round and ran out to an emergency exit, closely followed by everybody else.' Survived: The 47-year-old victim (pictured) escaped with cuts and bruises after he was fired at by customer Hsu Shen, 48 . Han's friends found him outside a short while later and took him to a hospital where doctors confirmed that, apart from bruising and a small cut, he was otherwise unharmed. They said had the telephone in his top pocket not stopped the bullet, he probably would have died. The shooter ran off after the incident but later turned himself in together with the handgun. Police are now investigating whether it was self defence or attempted murder, and confirmed that the shooter will in any case face charges of having an illegal firearm. Protected: The bullet penetrated the cover, but it became wedged in the phone as it sat in his top pocket .","Han Peng, 47, was drinking with friends in the city of Hsinchu, Taiwan .

"By . Wills Robinson . Wedged between the Louvre and the River Seine, it is one of the most beautiful public parks in the world, and a top spot for picnickers. But Paris's Tuileries Garden, which is invaded by tourists on a daily basis, is suffering from a different kind of infestation - by 'giant' rats. The city-centre park, which was once the private garden of Marie Antoinette, has constantly suffered from a rodent problem, but during the summer, visitors flock to the grass and leave litter lying everywhere. Scroll down for video . Infestation: Tourists bend down to look at the rats in the Tuileries Garden next to the Louvre in Paris . It causes the rats to arrive in huge numbers - picking up leftover food as they scurry between visitors. Staff at the Louvre work with city authorities to keep the rodents under control, but last week it called in a pest control agency. They are trying to use an 'ecological poison' to control the problem, but they say it has failed. Gardener Audrey Hacherez told The Guardian: 'It's horrible, we're scared of being bitten. 'The tourists throw their scraps of pizza and sandwiches all over the place.' Photographer Xavier Francolon captured around 30 of the rodents in the space of two days, some scampering with pieces of bread that had been left after picnics. But he claims that most Parisians ignore the animals and continue to eat and relax in their presence. The garden was set up by French Queen Catherine de Medicis in 1564 in the grounds of the Tuileries Palace and became a public park after the French Revolution. During the 19th century, it was used by Napoleon Bonoparte for military parades but also became a focal point for Parisians who wanted to relax. Paris's Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo has already tried to clear up the city's public gardens through a controversial smoking ban. It follows a new directive which allows bosses to ban wine in the work place – leading to accusations that the very heart of Gallic culture is under attack. Scurrying: The rodent problems worsen during the summer because of an influx of picnickers . Scraps: They have been caught running off with scraps of food left on the ground by visitors .

The 30-year-old son of former Wales and British and Irish Lions rugby winger JJ Williams, failed a test at the Glasgow Grand Prix event on July 11 and has been provisionally suspended from all competition. He becomes the second Welsh athlete to be forced out of Glasgow 2014 over an alleged doping offence after 800m runner Gareth Warburton was withdrawn earlier this month. Suspended: Rhys Williams, 30, has been kicked out of the Commonwealth Games for an alleged doping offence . Defence: The son of former Wales and British and Irish Lions rugby winger JJ Williams (left) claims he has not 'knowingly' taken any banned substances . Williams said he was 'absolutely devastated' by the news of his failed test and insisted he had never knowingly doped. In a statement released through his management company Concept Sports Management, he said: 'I am utterly devastated about the news of this anti-doping rule violation, which has come as a great shock to me. From the outset, I would strongly like to state that I have not knowingly taken any banned substance. 'As a professional athlete, I have always supported and have been an advocate of clean sport. However, I recognise that the responsibility for this situation lies with me and I'm committed to working with UK Anti-Doping and will fully co-operate in the legal process. 'I'd like to take this opportunity to wish all the best to my team-mates at the Commonwealth Games. To be named co-team captain for the Welsh athletics team was a great honour and I am distraught that I won't be able to fulfil this role and join them as part of Team Wales. I wish them all well. Legends: JJ Williams played 30 tests for Wales and made seven appearances for the British Lions as a winger during the 1970s . 'Finally, in line with this process and until the hearing of the national anti-doping panel, I will not be making any further comment.' Welsh Athletics confirmed Williams had been suspended. In a statement, it said: 'Rhys has the opportunity to respond to the charges against him and to have those charges determined at a full hearing before the national anti-doping panel. 'Welsh Athletics strongly supports clean sport and has established a comprehensive education programme for its athletes. Disappointed: Williams has said he is shocked and 'absolutely devastated' by the results . 'Welsh Athletics is obviously concerned that this is the second anti-doping violation by a senior Welsh international athlete and will be conducting its own internal review.' Williams, who was the co-captain of the Welsh athletics team in Glasgow, won the European title in Helsinki ahead of London 2012. UKAD chief executive Andy Parkinson said: 'UK Anti-Doping can confirm the provisional suspension of athlete Rhys Williams after being charged with committing an anti-doping rule violation under the IAAF Anti-Doping Rules. 'The athlete has the opportunity to respond to the charges against him, and to have those charges determined at a full hearing before the National Anti-Doping Panel.

"By . Wills Robinson . A terminally-ill schoolboy who was awarded a 'dream ride' in a Porsche suffered two broken legs and bit off his tongue when the car collided with oncoming traffic. Raphael Wittmann, 14, was placed in intensive care  after the high-powered sports car crashed in the outskirts of his home city of, Vienna, Austria, in May. He died two months later. His family claim the charity who organised the experience, Kinder Krebshlife, did not offer to help the youngster after the horrific crash, and as a result they are now demanding compensation. Tragic: Terminal cancer sufferer Raphael Wittmann, 14, ended up in intensive care and died two months after the crash in the outskirts of his hometown, Vienna, Austria . Scene: The emergency services tend to the youngster next to the crushed Porsche at the crash site in Vienna . The teenager was given intensive therapy at his home following his diagnoses 12 months ago, but it was not successful, and his parents were told he wasn't going to live. His father, Franz, 47, became determined to make his final months memorable, so managed to arrange a holiday to the Spanish island of Tenerife. But shortly before that, he was contacted by the children's cancer charity who invited Raphael for a drive in the high-performance car outside of Vienna. But the event ended tragically within minutes of starting when the Porsche 986 crashed into oncoming traffic, leaving the teen in intensive care with horrific injuries for two months before he passed away. The only acknowledgement  his family say he received from those involved in organising the event  was an iPhone from the driver who was at the wheel when Raphael died. Tragic: Raphael, pictured left with his mother and right draped in a football scarf, spent the last two months of his life recovering in intensive care . Treatment: Raphael was diagnosed with cancer last year. He underwent intensive radiotherapy at home but doctors said he was unlikely to live, meaning his parents wanted to make his last months memorable . His father Franz believes the accident on May 17 this year robbed his son of the will to live. 'After the hand that fate had dealt him, he just didn't have the strength to go on any longer' he said. And although the matter might have ended with the youngster's death on July 5, his father is still angry at the way they were treated by the children's charity. The family have now contacted lawyer Dr Astrid Wagner to take the charity to task. He said: 'I want justice for my dead boy. Not me.' Dr Wagner said: 'It was a charity event but these things should be properly organised and that means that the should be insurance as well as anything else. But the children's charity claim they didn't organise it, but won't tell us who did.' She said that as a result they had no option other than to take legal action against the charity. The head of the charity Karin Benedik, has denied any wrongdoing. She said: 'We tried to help this family, and our name is dragged through the mud as a result. We were not the organisers of this event, it was the Porsche forum.' Angry: Raphael's father Franz (left)contacted lawyer Astrid Wagner (right) to take legal action.

"By . Wills Robinson . These incredible pictures show a glider pilot bailing out after a terrifying mid-air collision at 4,500ft. Grandfather Andy Preston described how he was tipped upside down after what felt like a 'car crash in the air' and forced to quickly open his parachute before falling to the ground. The 70-year-old farmer, who was taking part in a gliding competition in Cambridgeshire, said it is the worst thing that has happened in his 19 years of flying and admitted he was lucky to get out. Scroll down for video . Mid-air: The horrifying events began to unfold after the two pilots collided during a competition in Cambridgeshire. Here they are pictured moments before the crash . Terrifying: The 70-year-old glider pilot was forced to take drastic action after the wing of his glider fell off . Free fall: As he jumped from the aircraft, he began to fall to the ground, prompting him to quickly release his parachute . 'It was very scary. It was like a car crash in the air. I was very lucky to get out. The other glider seemed to come out of nowhere,' the father-of-two said. 'I was 4500 foot up in the air, if you're going to crash then height is your friend. 'There was a very loud crash and my glider seemed to immediately tip upside down. It all happened very quickly.' Mr Preston, who has two children and two grandchildren added: 'I instantly knew I was in serious trouble. In training they teach you there are three things you have to do. I pulled the handle to open the canopy and then I pulled the buckle to release me and because of the latitude I was at I just fell out.' 'Once I was free of the aircraft I released the parachute. When I knew I was in trouble I just focused on getting on with it and my training kicked in. 'I then had two or three minutes of drifting down and there was no wind so I literally fell straight down. 'When I was falling time really slowed down. I'd never jumped out a plane before or anything like that so it was a very different experience.' Mr Preston described how he then crashed landed in a field, just 50 yards in front of a working combine harvester. Concerned the farmer didn't notice him, he managed to get to the edge of the crop. He was concerned he had killed the pilot of the other glider, but he managed to carry on flying and landed safely. Lucky: Andy Preston, 70, at his home in Milton Keynes, said the collision felt like a 'car crash in the air' and admitted he was fortunate to have got out . 'He didn't stop. I'm not sure if he hadn't seen me or if he thought I was just a professional parachuter. 'It's funny but it's also frightening to think I could have landed safely then been hit by farm equipment.' 'A farm worker came and gave me water and a phone. My leg was bleeding but the pain in my back and neck was the worst.' Mr . Preston took up gliding when he was 50 years old after his wife gave him . lessons as a birthday gift. He has since joined a gliding club, but . admits this is the worst experience he has been through. 'When . you go for a parachute jump they're big but gliders are so small that . the parachutes have to be too - they are intended purely for survival. It's equivalent to falling 12 ft off a roof. 'Paramedics . came and put me on a board. They decided at 9pm I was well enough to . get off the board but I was very wobbly and stayed the night. Bailing out: The pilot, aged 50, leapt from his cockpit following the collision and released his parachute . Escape: The pilot fell to the ground as the broken wing and aircraft plummeted to the ground . 'I . found out I had fractured a vertebrae, it's a stable fracture so it . won't require surgery. When I saw the photos I couldn't believe it, my . family couldn't believe it either. It was frightening to see the . pictures of me in the air.' Mr Preston said his love of gliding came from being an 'adrenaline junky' when he was younger. After 'flipping his car a few times, he learned how to remain cool in dangerous situations and 'not go stiff'. The 70 year old, who has been a farmer all of his life, said he is sad that the glider has gone, but does not think it is worth getting another. Local resident Martin Boss, who captured . the horrifying moment from his garden, was shocked to see the wing break . away from the glider and plummet to the ground. The electronics engineer, had been in his garden trying to get photos of . birds when he saw the gliders about half a mile away. The 45-year-old,  said it was a shock to see the two gliders collide and one start to break up. He . said: 'There were about half a dozen to eight gliders and I took some . pictures of them. Then two of them touched each other, one of the wings . came off, and it went straight down.' Mr Preston's glider  crashed upside down in a field near Little Paxton in Cambridgeshire. The broken wing landed nearby. The . pilot of the second glider was able to land safely on an airfield near . Bedford. The accident in now being investigated by the British Gliding . Association (BGA). Drifted: The pilot, safely suspended by the parachute, drifted slowly towards the ground as the broken wing sailed further away from the aircraft . The . pilots were taking part in the week-long Hus Bos Challenge Cup on . Saturday afternoon, which had 35 contestants, and each glider was . believed to have been flying at around 50mph. They were flying from the Gliding Centre at Husbands Bosworth, near Market Harborough in Leicestershire. Pete Stratten, chief executive of the BGA, said: 'This type of accident happens very rarely, it is a relatively safe sport but everybody does accept there is a greater risk than climbing on a commercial aircraft.' He said each glider would have been flying around 50mph and the force of the crash was enough to separate the wing from the glider. He added: 'The pilot jumped out effectively and the other pilot landed immediately.' Wreckage: The damaged glider landed upside down in a field in Little Paxton, Cambridgeshire. The broken wing fell to the ground and rested nearby . Scene: Police were called to the crash site while the pilot was taken to hospital . Reflection: The father-of-two has said he is sad that the glider is gone, but does not think it is worth getting another one .","Two gliders crashed at 4,500ft during a competition in Cambridgeshire .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A pair of rotting corpses have been found inside an abandoned funeral home two years after it was shut down for not cremating bodies. One of the bodies has been identified as that of Marshall Lee Allen, who died of pneumonia in 2011 aged 63. His daughter, Kimberly Wall, says the experince of trying to track down her father's remains for almost three years has sent her 'to hell and back.' Two bodies have been found inside a funeral home in North Carolina two years after it was shut down when clients complained remains were not being returned to them . The bodies were discovered after former owner Mary McLendon admitted in court on Wednesday that there was a body inside the shuttered property . Speaking to Wsoctv, she said she spent $1,500 on a viewing and cremation service for Allen at McLendon Funeral Home, but his remains were never returned to her. Police eventually tracked the body down after the home's former owner, Mary McLendon, admitted in court on Wednesday that there was still a corpse inside the property. Officers found one body wrapped in blankets inside a casket, before unexpectedly discovering another lying on a table, which has yet to be identified. Ms Wall said: 'You can't explain it. This is something I wouldn't wish on nobody. She destroyed so many lives that you can't fit back together.' McLendon . Funeral Home was closed in 2012 after clients complained that McLendon . was taking payments for cremations and burial services without . performing them. When police raided the home on that occasion, they found three bodies left inside. Police found one body wrapped in blankets inside a casket, but were surprised to discover another lying on a table. One body has been identified as that of Marshall Lee Allen, who died in 2011 . McLendon has been sentenced to between 6 and 17 months in jail after being found guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses . One of them was Richard Bennett, who had died five months before his body was found, authorities said at the time. McLendon was sentenced to 6 to 17 months in prison at Anson County court for obtaining property by false pretenses. Speaking about the trial, Wall added: 'I wish she could have been charged with murder or something because she killed a part of me when she did that.' Wsoctv also claims that McLendon had a history of violations dating back to 2006, including changing dates on death certificates, using funeral funds for her own use, and failing to refund clients. In 2010, deputies found another three dead bodies inside the funeral home that weren't properly disposed of.","McLendon Funeral Home closed in 2012 after complaints from clients .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A soldier who is facing the death penalty over the murder of his five-year-old daughter in Hawaii has pleaded with jurors to spare his life. Naeem Williams read a statement in court on Wednesday in which he apologized for his actions, as a jury meets to decide whether he should face the death sentence. Williams was convicted of capital murder in April, after beating his young daughter, Talia, to death in July 2005. Sentencing: Naeem Williams could face the death penalty after being found guilty of murdering his child, Talia . Victim: Talia Williams was five years old when her father, Naeem, beat her to death . In the final fatal blow, Williams left an imprint of . his knuckle on Talia's chest. She had been beaten and struck with fists and belts for seven months. In his statement, delivered with long pauses and sniffles, WIlliams said: 'Talia deserved a better father than me. 'Instead of helping and protecting Talia, I hurt and I killed her.' After reading his statement to the court on Wednesday, there was little visible reaction from the jurors. They previously heard him testify that while he was stationed in Hawaii, he and Talia's stepmother, Delilah Williams, beat the child almost daily. He claimed he was disciplining her for bathroom accidents and because of frustrations he was experiencing in his marriage. Plea deal: Williams with his wife, Delilah, who detailed how they beat her step-daughter Talia for seven months . Abused: The court was told Talia was beaten nearly every day for seven months by her father and step-mother . The child's stepmother, Deliliah, testified against her husband as part of a plea deal for a 20-year sentence. She had revealed graphic and disturbing details of abuse earlier in the trial, which included withholding food . from Talia for days at a time. She also said the five-year-old had been beaten while she was duct-taped . to a bed, pulled so hard by the hair that she was left with a bald . spot, and stomped on her until bone cracked. The parents took Talia out of school shortly before her death to hide the signs of the abuse. Tragic: Talia was beaten to death in 2005 . Naeem Williams testified previously that he . delayed calling 911 when Talia didn't get up from one of his blows. He . said he and his wife fretted over making sure a relative could pick up . the infant. If Williams is sentenced to death, it will be the first time in the history of Hawaii's statehood because territorial leaders abolished capital punishment in 1957. Because the crime occurred on military property, the case is in federal court, where the death penalty is available. Williams said he wants the chance to be a better father to his two other children, an 11-year-old son who lives in Georgia and a nine-year-old daughter who lives in Tennessee. The children testified Wednesday that they enjoy their relationship with him even though he is incarcerated in Hawaii. His . daughter was born in Hawaii and was an infant when Talia was killed. She said she has visited him at the Honolulu Federal Detention Center. Her mother is being held at the same facility after she pleaded guilty to her role in Talia's death. The . girl said she talks to her dad on the phone every Sunday and emails . him. The boy said he talks to his father three to five times a month and . emails him a couple times a month. 'We talk about a lot of stuff. We might talk about maybe who's playing basketball or who's your favorite team,' the boy told the court. He broke down in tears when asked how he feels about his father, telling the court: 'I love my dad. I really need him.'","Naeem Williams could be first person in Hawaii to face capital punishment .

Scaffolding has just come down from the property, which has been funded by a company formed by philosopher Alain de Botton and sits overlooking the Stour estuary near Wrabness in Essex. Perry has created what he has described as a 'secular chapel' with his first step into the world of architecture, with tiled exterior walls and a brass finish to the roof.

His progress on the project has been filmed for a Channel 4 programme Grayson's Greatest Design, working with de Botton's company Living Architecture which aims to create holiday homes in properties with striking and innovative designs. Perry has created a folly-style building, dedicated to the memory of a mythical Essex 'everywoman' called Julie with statues and images set into the tiles. The project received planning permission despite some objections and Perry has in the past admitted that calmed down his original design which he said stemmed from 'doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the TV'. Perry said the project, dedicated to the memory of a mythical everywoman called Julie, was calmed down from his original design of doodling wildly and quite drunkenly in front of the TV . The site of the building, which Perry describes as a secular chapel, is still under construction but will be completed at the end of the year . He sought inspiration from single mothers in Dagenham and hairdressers in Colchester as well as taking into account the landscape and history of Essex. Perry collaborated with the architectural practice FAT, working with local builders and craftspeople. It will remain under construction until much later in the year.","The artist described the Essex building as a 'secular chapel .

"By . Emily Payne . An expectant mother told her unborn twins were nothing more than a mass of cells gave birth to a 'miracle' baby boy after medics failed to spot his heartbeat. Leanne Storey, from Belfast in Northern Ireland, claims she was told her pregnancy was 'not viable'. The 27-year-old was told she had suffered a molar pregnancy - where cells fail to form into a foetus - with doctors advising she undergo surgery to remove the tissue. The mother-of-two had surgery, but was shocked when at a follow-up scan medics told her had detected a heartbeat. Miracle boy: Shea Storey is thought to be one of the first babies to have survived a dilation and curettage procedure . Happy family: Shia, pictured left with his mother Leanne, and right, with his sister Teighan, four . Ms Storey, who has started legal proceedings with The Belfast Trust for medical negligence, said medics confirmed one of her babies had survived the procedure. She went on to carry her son to full term, making him one of the only babies thought to have survived a dialation and curettage (D and C) procedure aimed at removing the molar pregnancy. She said: 'I don’t want anyone else to have to go through what I have been through. 'I couldn’t imagine life without Shea now, he is so special to me. I feel blessed that he made it through after such a traumatic start. 'When I was told that my pregnancy wasn’t viable, I was devastated.The idea of a D and C was heartbreaking, and I dreaded having it. 'But when I heard his heartbeat at the follow up appointment, it was like a dream come true. 'I am just so thankful to have him home with me now. He’s a miracle.' The 27-year-old found out she was pregnant with twins in May 2013. She said: 'I was delighted and excited to be pregnant again. After attending the hospital with pain I found out I was carrying twins. 'But when an appointment was made to determine how far along the twins were, I realised something was wrong by the midwife’s face. Surprise joy: During a scan to determine how far along she was, Leanne was told there was a 99 per cent chance it was a molar pregnancy . Tough pregnancy: Leanne says she worried throughout her pregnancy, and had to have weekly scans to check Shea was healthy . 'I asked if everything was okay, and the midwife said no. I started to cry.' The . midwives told her she was having a molar pregnancy - a condition where . the foetus - or foetuses - do not fully develop, and there was no living baby inside . her. Ms Storey said: 'A doctor was called and rescanned me. 'He confirmed there was a 99 per cent chance it was a molar pregnancy and I needed a D and C. 'I asked about the other one per cent but was told if it was not a molar pregnancy, it was a miscarriage.' 'The doctor told me ""there's a foetus""... he quickly reassured me there was a heartbeat. I couldn't believe it' - Leanne Storey . She was booked in for the surgery on June 10, 2013, dreading what was to come. She said: 'I was crying all weekend. I was so scared about the procedure on Monday.' But Ms Storey made it to theatre and was relieved when she thought it was all over. She added: 'When I woke up from the D and C the theatre staff informed me it went well. I just wanted to go home. 'But four days later I started feeling sick and dizzy and was referred to hospital by my GP.' Ms Storey was scanned again to see if she needed a second D and C to remove any tissue missed in the first surgical procedure. But during the scan, medics made the shock discovery that the 27-year-old was in fact still expecting. Happy ending: Leanne and Shea are now back home with Leanne¿s daughter Teighan . The 27-year-old said: 'The doctor told me ""there’s a foetus"" and started to point it out. 'But I thought he meant my dead baby so I started crying. But he quickly assured me that there was a heartbeat. 'I couldn’t believe it. I asked about my second baby but there was no mention of another baby. 'I was so relieved to not need further treatment for a molar pregnancy as this was not the case.' Ruth Bender-Atik, National Director of Miscarriage Association, said: 'A . molar pregnancy is one which begins with a chromosomally abnormal . embryo that can’t survive, however the cells that normally become the . placenta grow abnormally and need to be removed surgically. 'When that happens, the tissue that is removed should be tested in the lab to confirm that it’s molar tissue. 'It’s rare for an ongoing pregnancy to survive surgical management, but this may be what happened here. 'Miscarriage . can be a very unhappy and frightening experience, and I can well . imagine that this lady had a very difficult and distressing pregnancy, . even though it happily led to the birth of her son.' But Ms Storey couldn’t relax for the rest of her pregnancy knowing what her baby had been through. She said: 'I asked if my baby was in any danger and was advised I would have weekly scans. 'The whole way through my pregnancy I was worrying about the danger to my baby. 'Since . the hospital provided no written information for me on molar pregnancy . to look over, I searched the internet to see if a healthy baby had ever . been born after a D and C, but I couldn’t find any results. 'I was really worried. The whole nine months were a nightmare and I couldn’t enjoy my pregnancy. I just wanted my baby in my arms.' But Shea, thought to be one of the only babies to have survived a D and C, was born on the January 17. Ms Storey, said: 'I had been preparing myself that he might not be but he was the most beautiful baby ever.' Ms Storey and Shea are now back home with the 27-year-old's daughter Teighan, four. She said: 'Now I am just so thankful to have him home with us. He completes our family. Teighan is fantastic with him.' Ms Storey has started legal proceedings with The Belfast Trust for medical negligence. She added: 'I don’t want anyone else to have to go through what I have been through.' A spokesman for The Belfast Trust said: 'We are very sorry if Ms Storey has felt let down in any way by Belfast Trust. 'We fully understand that she may have concerns or further questions and that a legal process has begun, therefore it would be inappropriate to discuss in detail this particular issue.'","Leanne Storey was pregnant with twins, but was told it was molar pregnancy -  so the foetuses would remain just a mass of cells .

"By . Emily Payne . A baby girl has been born with paralysed vocal cords - leaving her unable to gurgle or even cry. Three-month-old Leya Raper may one day regain her voice but currently, her mother Casey, 23, can only tell she is distressed by looking out for tears or a sad face. The baby girl was born with bilateral vocal cord paralysis - meaning that both sides of her vocal cords are unable to move. Specialists at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth gave Leya a tracheotomy - an opening made in the neck to provide her with an airway . She was able to make sounds and gurgle in her first few days but Casey and Leya's father, Dan, also 23, soon noticed problems with her breathing. Doctors told them it was nothing to worry about but the couple from Bude, Cornwall, rushed her to A&E when she became so short of oxygen she started turning blue. Specialists at Plymouth’s Derriford Hospital diagnosed the little girl with bilateral vocal cord paralysis after examining her throat with a tiny camera. They had no choice but to give Leya a tracheotomy - an opening made in the neck to provide her with an airway. The 90-minute operation was a success but, by a cruel irony, the air she breathes now bypasses her vocal cords meaning the she cannot make a sound. And because babies can’t produce tears for their first month or so, Casey and Dan could only rely on facial expressions to tell if she was crying. Full-time mother Casey said: 'From birth we had problems - she would go blue and would stop breathing. 'We had to breathe in her face or squeeze her foot to make her cry and breathe again. 'Having the tracheotomy was our only option. Her episodes were becoming so severe it was the safest thing for her. 'She was able to cry and make noises before but the tracheotomy has been installed below her voice box which means air no longer rushes past her vocal cords when she tries to make a noise. 'There are a few tears now but we’ve mainly only been able to tell if she was crying by looking at her facial expressions - it’s heart wrenching. Leya¿s long term prognosis is unclear and her parents don't know how long she¿ll need her tracheotomy . 'We can also tell if she’s giggling but she makes no noise. She moves her mouth as if she’s going to make a sound - that’s really hard for us both to deal with.' Casey, who married self-employed electrician Dan last year, says Leya’s long term prognosis is unclear and doesn’t know how long she’ll need her tracheotomy. They are currently staying with their daughter in hospital while they learn to maintain the device, which will need changing once a week. Casey added: 'The future for us at the moment is uncertain. 'We need to wait until her voice cords become stronger and start moving. It make take one year, five year or 15 years - we just don’t know. Leya's parents Casey and Dan Raper are learning sign language so they can communicate fully with their daughter in years to come . 'Hopefully she will grow out of it and will eventually able to speak, but there’s no guarantee. Her voice box might not recover from it. 'She will eventually learn that if she puts her finger over the hole she will make some noise, but that won’t be for some time.' The family are learning sign language so they can communicate fully with Leya in years to come. Casey is also writing an online blog to raise awareness of the condition, which is usually caused by damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which controls the movement of the vocal cords. It can be damaged during childbirth, during spinal surgery or caused by infection or neurological problems. In some cases no cause can be identified. Children with one-sided vocal cord paralysis can be treated with voice therapy, which is likened to physiotherapy for the voice box, or an operation to reshape the vocal cords. Two-sided vocal cord paralysis, however, is more serious and often requires immediate treatment. Casey said: 'For now it’s just a matter of supporting her as best we can - she has been so strong throughout this. 'We will be doing everything we possibly can to help her and give her a happy and normal life.'","Three-month-old Leya Raper from Cornwall cannot cry or even gurgle .

"By . Emily Payne . The parents of a severely ill baby girl are threatening to take legal action after an ethics committee ruled that doctors can withdraw her breathing support - a move they fear will end her life. Amelia was diagnosed with PCH1B - an rare neurodegenerative disorder - in December last year. Her mother and father were told that only a 'handful' of cases have ever been diagnosed worldwide and, with no known cure for the condition, Amelia was given just 12 months to live. In March this year, medical staff, with the support of Amelia's parents, drew up an end of life care plan, which stated that Amelia would not be transferred to ICU if she suffered a seizure or became more ill. Shelley Bielby and her partner are threatening to take legal action after an ethics committee ruled that doctors can withdraw their daughter Amelia Rose's breathing support - a move they fear will end her life . It was agreed that she would not receive breathing support if she contracted a cold or picked up a hospital bug - a decision which her parents are fighting to change. Amelia's mother Shelley Beilby said: 'Because Amelia's condition is terminal and she was expected to deteriorate rapidly, we didn't want her to suffer and so we agreed to it. 'But she is doing so well and we are all surprised at how stable she is. 'Based on what the doctors told us, we didn't think she'd be here now but she is. 'She's progressing, she knows who we are and she smiles and we think it's unfair to stick to the life plan when you look at how far she's come. 'I think the ethical committee sees breathing support or treatment in ICU as prolonging death not encouraging life. 'The hospital staff are concerned about us too because we have been living in the hospital and haven't even been home since September. 'They said that it's a burden for us and it's too much for anybody to bear but that's not the case. 'We just want what's best for Amelia and, after seeing how well she's doing, I'm no longer comfortable with the end of life care plan. 'If she catches even just a cold it could affect her breathing and if she doesn't get the support she needs that could be it. 'To lose her to something as small as that after everything she's been through isn't right. 'I feel sick with worry every time she gets a sniffle. 'There's so many bugs in hospital she could easily pick something up. 'We want to give her a fighting chance and that's why we are doing everything in our power to get the life plan changed.' The 23-month-old suffers from a rare condition which means she requires constant breathing assistance . According to the plan, if Amelia's condition deteriorates, she will not receive breathing support and will only be treated with antibiotics. After demanding a review of the plan, the ethical committee held a meeting two weeks ago to discuss whether changes should be made if Amelia takes a turn for the worse. Shelley and her partner Robert, 34, a groundworker, said they will find out the final ruling on Monday but said the committee recommended at the time that the plan stays in place. Shelley said: 'We are waiting to hear for certain on Monday but we are ready to fight this in the courts if we need to. 'I don't want to think about fighting people during what could be the last few months of Amelia's life. 'I don't want to think about fighting people during what could be the last few months of Amelia's life. I'm really upset because I don't want to remember her last months like this' - Shelley Beilby, Amelia's mother . 'I'm really upset because I don't want to remember her last months like this. 'I want to enjoy my time with Amelia while we've got it.' A spokesman from Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust, told the Mail Online: 'As a specialist children’s hospital, Alder Hey treats many children with complex, life threatening illnesses. 'Sadly, despite receiving the very best expertise and care, some children are unable to recover from their illness or condition. 'In such a situation, medical professionals will meet to discuss the most appropriate care plan going forward, focusing on the comfort and wellbeing of the child concerned. 'For every child this is discussed in full with the family before an agreement is reached about the most appropriate ongoing care needed for that child. 'If an . agreement between clinicians and parents cannot be reached, the case is taken . before a High Court to enable a judge to decide. The ruling is yet to be confirmed in writing, but Miss Beilby and Mr Dainton are in further limbo after Amelia stopped breathing on Monday night and was sent to Intensive Care, with extra breathing support. Her parents Shelley Beilby, 29, and partner Robert Dainton (pictured with Amelia) are threatening legal action as they believe, while Amelia, affectionately known as Mimi, is seriously ill, she still has quality of life . Miss Beilby said: 'Amelia stopped breathing and her main consultant was called in from home and we talked. 'We both agreed that if Amelia didn’t start breathing properly on her own she would go to ICU. 'This goes against what they had decided previously. 'As it stands, the life plan is being adjusted to say that depending on the situation and cause, ICU isn't completely ruled out. 'It’s more of a compromise. But the ethics committee ruling still stands and we are due to look over their decision in writing on Monday. 'Sadly, despite receiving the very best expertise and care, some children are unable to recover from their illness or condition' - Spokesman for Alder Hey Hospital . 'The feeling is that the team is divided in their opinions as to what’s best and not just disagreeing with me. 'I’m confused because what happened last night is what I asked them to do in the first place. 'But I’m happier with the plan as it is now because I know they will consider upping her support in situations like that. 'I have no idea what’s going to happen still but we are still talking with the medics and I’m currently still only receiving legal advice over the phone.' A hospital spokeswoman added: 'The trust is unable to comment on individual cases. 'We understand that this is an ongoing, highly sensitive case and we continue to liaise closely with the family concerned.'

"By . Emily Payne . Fewer boys are being born in central Scotland - and it's thought pollution may be playing a part. A study by the University of Stirling . found that the ratio of boys to girls being born is falling. While evidence suggests that male babies more often die in the womb than females, it is now thought pollution could be one factor behind this. Ultrasound: The number of baby boys being born in parts of central Scotland are decreasing . Across the world, slightly more boys are . born than girls. But statistics show the proportion of boys to . girls being born in Scotland, or the sex ratio, has been on a downward . trend since 1960 - and in the industrial parts of central Scotland in . particular. Analysing data from 1973 through to 2010, the team . found a 'significant upward skewing' of the sex ratio in the Highlands, . compared with a downward shift in the Forth Valley and the Borders. Researchers found 'significantly lower sex ratios for populations where industrial . air pollution is highest' in eastern central Scotland. The researchers add their findings are consistent . with small studies in heavily industrialised parts of Canada and . elsewhere in the world. More research is needed, they say, but warn that care should be taken when planning large industrial developments, as they may have an effect on hormone levels of the local population. The scientists focused on chemicals or pollution that, at certain and sometimes very low doses, can interfere with the endocrine (or hormone system) in human beings. Dr Ewan McDonald, the lead investigator, said: 'The reproductive health of populations is often difficult to measure, particularly before pregnancy and at the early stages. 'There is strong evidence that during early pregnancy loss, male foetuses are lost more often. In utero: Evidence suggests that male babies die in the womb more often  than females, . 'The sex . ratio, particularly declines in male births, can therefore be a marker . for changes in reproductive health or fertility amongst human . populations. 'Our analysis on sex ratio was extensive: over time, regions, neighbourhoods and socio-economic groups across Scotland.' He said the results indicate that the effect of pollution on hormones may be to blame for the national decline in the proportion of male births. Professor Andrew Watterson, also involved in the research, said: 'The study raises important questions about our knowledge of what may impact on human reproductive health and how we then shape public health policy.' The study is published in the International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health.","Researchers from the University of Stirling looked at birth ratios in Scotland .

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . The world's first suicide prevention app is set to be launched in Australia, specifically targeting young people in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities. iBobbly is a joint venture between Black Dog Institute and the Western Australia based suicide prevention group Alive and Kicking Goals and aims to reach young people in indigenous communities. Suicide is the leading cause of death among all Australians aged between 15 and 44 years-old and accounts for 1.6 percent of all deaths on a national level. But among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, suicide counts for 4.2 percent of all deaths and the suicide rate of young indigenous Australians is five times higher than the rate for non-indigenous youth. iBobbly is the first suicide prevention app in the world and aims to reduce the rate of suicide among indigenous Australians . 'We know what the risk factors are for suicide in the general population and those risk factors are more prevalent in some Aboriginal communities – social and econ disadvantage, isolation, and we know that when unemployment goes up so does the rate of suicide,' Dr Fiona Shand, research fellow at Black Dog Institute told Daily Mail Australia. 'That's only one part of it though, what we know is that there's been clusters of suicide, it gets to a level in some communities where suicide becomes a normal coping mechanism,' she said. The app, the first of its kind in the world, derives its name from a Kimberley greeting, ""Ay bubbly?"", which means ""Hey brother, how you doing?"" Its aim is to decrease suicidal thinking and increase help-seeking among indigenous youth, particularly those in remote communities which are often lacking essential health services. 'We know that indigenous Australians are not seeking face to face mental health care, more than 70 percent of indigenous suicides occur in people who are not previously known to health services,' said Dr Shand. 'Indigenous youth have a high rate of mobile phone usage so it makes sense that we engage them on technology they are comfortable with and able to use in their own private time.' The app, the first of its kind in the world, derives its name from a Kimberley greeting . The app is a joint venture between Black Dog Institute and WA-based charity Alive and Kicking Goals . The app aims to reach people who may not have access to mental health services in their community . Dr Shand and other researchers have spent the last year in the Kimberley region work-shopping the app and trying to find out how to reach indigenous youth. The app works by teaching young people psychological lessons and helping them to deal with negative emotions through interactive games, which often draw from indigenous metaphors, images and stories. Dr Fiona Shand, research fellow from the Black Dog Institute, has been working with local indigenous youth in the Kimberly, work-shopping methods to engage with indigenous youth . For example, says Dr Fiona Shand, the app uses metaphors drawn from nature to explain psychological concepts and has suggestions for dealing with emotions that are culturally relevant. 'We suggest going and having a conversation with someone in your first language if your first language is an indigenous language [if feeling strong negative emotions], so some of those more culturally relevant activities,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Another aim of the app is to provide a way for indigenous young people to seek help anonymously, which is often impossible for people living in small. 'What we know is that particularly among young men, the rate of help seeking incredibly low and one of the big barriers is shame. What we're testing is whether an intervention that is relatively anonymous could help with that. If you're living in a small community and everyone knows everyone, how do you anonymously seek help?' said Dr Shand. A pilot testing the government-funded app in the Kimberley is about to come to a close and the researchers will look to expand into a nationwide trial next year before launching. Anyone who is suffering from depression or mental health issues should contact Lifeline on 131 114 (Australia) the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 1800 273 8255 (USA) or the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 (UK), or a local help group .","iBobbly, the world's first suicide prevention app, set to be launched .

"By . Emily Payne . Low self-esteem: Paul Innes told This Morning his hair loss affected his confidence . Like many men in their thirties, Paul Innes was unhappy about his thinning hair. Desperate to save his receding hairline, the father-of-three, from Hull, sought help from his GP. Speaking on ITV's This Morning, he said: 'I became paranoid about my appearance so I went to my family doctor and expressed my concerns about my hair loss.' The doctor performed blood tests to rule out thyroid problems, and Mr Innes was recommended Propecia - an EU approved drug, also known as finasteride. It works by stopping the conversion of the hormone testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is thought to be the active hormone in hair loss. He was told that there was a 2 per cent chance among users of sexual dysfunction - but this side effect would disappear if he stopped taking the medication. After forking out around £90 for a course of the pills, he began taking the drugs. But within about six weeks he says he began to have 'strange thoughts'. 'I started to feel quite . withdrawn from my usual social activities such as playing football, . watching my local team play, going out with friends, ' he explained. 'I tended to spend . more time indoors and I just felt low in mood generally.' His relationship then came to an end - something he blames on the insecurity he felt, due to his hair loss. He said: 'In the early part of 2013 I started to pay attention to my hair loss again and that's when I decided to go back on the Propecia again.' It was at around this time that Paul met a new girlfriend, Hayley Waudby. He . said: 'I remember speaking to Hayley before I bought the Propecia the . second time and telling her I was concerned about my hair loss.' Paul Innes and his former girlfriend  Hayley Waudby, who is now pregnant with his child . Ms Waudby, also appearing on This Morning, said: 'I said ""Why would you want to do that?"" I didn't understand why he'd want to do that when he had a good head of hair.' Despite this, he continued taking the medication - but this time around the side effects were much more intense. 'I hadn't noticed any changes, sexually, the first time around, but this time it was horrific,' he said. 'It started with the onset of insomnia, where I didn't sleep for a week. I had to go to my family GP to get medication to treat my insomnia. A study found that men who take the hair loss drug . finasteride, also known as Propecia, can experience prolonged periods of low . libido. Dr Michael Irwig, assistant professor of medicine at George Washington . University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, discovered that 94 percent . of men taking finasteride developed low sexual desire, 92 percent suffered from . erectile dysfunction and 69 percent experienced difficulty with orgasm. The study, to be published in the Journal of Sexual . Medicine, is the first to show that symptoms persisted for at least three . months in otherwise healthy men, even when they stopped taking the drug. It’s thought the drug alters levels of important brain . chemicals called neurotransmitters that affect mood and other bodily functions. 'When I was trying to be intimate with Hayley I was practically impotent and I remember more or less waking up one morning and I had no connection between my brain and my genitals - it was unbelievable. Speaking to The Sun earlier in the week, he said: 'My penis is totally different in size and girth. 'It’s . much shorter and thinner. It now functions about ten per cent of the . time with Viagra. 'Every time me and Hayley tried to make love, . my head said yes but down there I felt nothing. I felt like a failure, . like less of a man because I couldn’t seem to make love to my own . girlfriend.' Talking to Holly Willoughby and Phillp Schofield, he said: 'I was in a whirlwind of mixed emotions. I didn't know what was going on with me. At that point I decided to inform my family that I'd been taking this medication. 'They took me to seek help through my family GP and despite coming off the medication, and having only taken it for three weeks I started to get really, really low, very depressed.' 'A crisis team was called to my home and they decided it was a good idea to go into a psychiatric unit voluntarily, which I felt I needed because I couldn't keep myself safe. 'I couldn't function, I couldn't look after myself. I just didn't know why I was feeling so abnormal.' Despite Paul’s impotence problems, the couple, who broke up two months ago were shocked to discover in January that Hayley was pregnant. Paul told The Sun: 'We still love each other and we’re having a baby together but at the moment I just need to focus on getting my head around what’s happened.'","Paul Innes, 36, from Hull, took over the counter pill Propecia for hair loss .

"By . Emily Payne . A woman who suffered seizures every five minutes has undergone surgery to have part of her brain removed in a bid to get her condition under control. Iona Davies, 21, from Ulverston, Cumbria, started having seizures when she was just 14. She was finally diagnosed with epilepsy when she was 17, but by then she was having seizures up to 20 times a day. Misery: Iona Davies, pictured left post-surgery in hospital, and right now, was unable to lead a normal life . She was so unwell that she couldn't even shower alone. But following the radical surgery, she has just one or two seizures a week and is finally living a normal life. The surgery can take up to two years to recover from so it is hoped the frequency of Iona’s seizures will continue to decrease. She said: 'My friends were very supportive, but I couldn’t go out alone, even just to walk the dog. 'I felt like I’d been robbed of growing up because of my epilepsy. 'They had to run a tests to find out if I’d be eligible for the surgery, and I don’t think anyone has ever been so pleased to hear they can have brain surgery. 'It’s such a relief to get my life back since the operation.' Iona had the operation in October last year, just after her 21st birthday. Iona, pictured with her mother and at the Walton Centre is Liverpool, right, had a section of her brain removed . Doctors at the Walton Centre in Liverpool removed a thumb-sized section from the left side of her brain, and another smaller piece from the part of the brain controlling her memory. Iona said: 'Going into brain surgery was scary, but I was more focused on how it could change my life afterwards. 'They didn’t know until I woke up how it would have affected my memory, or even if I’d still be able to speak. 'My mum said she’s never been happier to hear me ask for a blanket.' Iona’s seizures began as complex partial seizures, where she would lose consciousness for a few seconds, but as time went on she also suffered grand mal seizures, with muscle convulsions. She said: 'It just felt like I was asleep for a few seconds, I just went completely blank - and then I would come straight back into the conversation. Recovery: Doctors are hoping that Iona, pictured with her mother Patty, will suffer from far fewer seizures in future .

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . Albert James was a federal Labor MP between 1960 and 1980. Newly released documents say that during that time he was working as a KGB informant . Newly released Russian intelligence documents have revealed that a federal Labor MP was a secret KGB informant. Albert James, who served as the federal member for Hunter, in NSW, from 1960 to 1980, was listed as an informant in secret intelligence papers. The documents belonged to Vasili Mitrokhin, a KGB archivist who defected to the United Kingdom in 1992, bringing with him extensive records about Russian intelligence operations, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. James, codename Agent Albert, is one of a number of Australian listed in Mitrokhin's records as a KGB agent or informant during the 1960s and 1970s. It is not known what information James passed to the Soviet Union, but he was known for being strongly opposed to Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War and spoke in favour if the communist regime in Cuba under Fidel Castro. This is the first time allegations that James was a KGB informant have come to light, but ASIO records did show that James was in regular contact with an official at the Soviet Embassy in Canberra, Alexander Ekimenko, who was suspected by ASIO of being an intelligence officer, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. James, who served as a policeman for 20 years before winning the seat of Hunter, which was previously held by his father Rowley James, passed away in 2006 at the age of 92. Other Australians named in the intelligence files include Silver', believed to be Reginald de Bray, a professor of Russian at Monash University and ‘student K', believed to be Katerina Clark, the daughter of famous Australian historian Manning Clark. Ms Clark studied in Moscow through an academic exchange programme and when Professor de Bray travelled the Soviet Union, he expressed an interest in Ms Clark's contacts and work. The documents containing information about the Australian informants and agents were released by the Churchill College Archive in the United Kingdom last month.

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . Nick Vasilaris was the youngest son of Maria and Chris, both 70. He died from brain cancer in May this year, almost two years after being diagnosed . When Nick Vasilaris was diagnosed with brain cancer two years ago he began furiously researching its causes and became convinced he had contracted it through using his mobile phone. The infectious 40-year-old Gold Coast restaurateur who passed away in May this year became determined to raise awareness about the cancer, which is the biggest single cancer killer of people under the age of 40. 'The doctor believes it was from the phone, [the tumour] was on the left side just above his ear and he was left-handed and on the phone 24 hours a day,' Nick's mother Maria Vasilaris told Daily Mail Australia. 'They can't prove anything like that, so what Nick wanted to do is start the foundation, to raise money for cancer research, give warnings to young people about using their mobile phones. 'It's like smoking, how many years [did it take] them to prove that smoking caused lung cancer? How long for this?' Nick's idea was to host an event at restaurants across Queensland, including at his own restaurant Café Fresh, called Phone-Free Feast, where people would leave their mobile phones and tablets at home and a portion of their bill would be donated to brain cancer research. After Nick passed away on May 23 this year his parents, Chris and Maria Vasilaris, as well as the Cure Brain Cancer organisation banded together to make Nick's dream happen. 'He told the doctor “I'll do something about it"". He wanted to start the foundation, he got sick and he couldn't do it. We had to carry on that work,' said Mrs Vasilaris. 'He was my baby. His death is very devastating for me and my husband and my two sons… But I'm grateful we're doing [Phone-Free Feast] because he wanted to do it and we're finishing it for him.' Nick (centre in white shirt) ran Gold Coast restaurant Cafe Fresh. He wanted to run a fundraising event for brain cancer research which saw people leave their mobile phones at home . The pilot Phone-Free Feast ran yesterday in 10 restaurants across Queensland and the Cure Brain Cancer organisation will gather information about how successful it is before deciding whether to make the event an annual fundraising and to expand it nationwide. Beverley Trivett, founder-benefactor of Cure Brain Cancer, told Daily Mail Ausralia that Cure Brain Cancer was not 'in any way intimating that technology is a contributor to brain cancer' saying that numerous studies had shown there is 'absolutely no correlation' between mobile phone usage and brain cancer. But she said the Phone-Free Feast was a good way of drawing attention to brain cancer, which despite being the biggest single cancer killer of children and having a much lower survival rate than breast cancer or prostate cancer, only attracted three percent of government funding for cancer research and treatment. The event was also a way of encouraging interpersonal etiquette and dinner conversation, something that was one of Nick's pet peeves, who had seen the prevalence of mobile phone usage by diners at his restaurant. 'When mum and dad go out to dinner what do you do to make the kids shut up? You give them the phone, that's no good. What do you do when you go to dinner with your husband? You talk on your phone, you don't enjoy your food, you don't talk to each other,' said Mrs Vasilaris. Ms Trivett said that leaving one's phone at home or switiching it off was 'challenging' but the idea behind the fundraiser was 'enjoy the environment, enjoy the food, enjoy your company', an ethos she – and Mrs Vasilaris – think Nick would have approved of.","Nick Vasilaris, 40, a Gold Coast restauranteur died from cancer in May .

"By . Kate Lyons For Daily Mail Australia . It is believed Reetika (right) and Jeetender Ajjan were involved in an Australian visa scam in 2011 . A corrupt immigration official and her husband who were involved in a $3 million visa racket were allowed to flee the country with more than $1 million in the bank days after their home was raided by federal agents. Reetika Ajjan, a former employee of the Australian Department of Immigration, is accused of supplying government information and equipment to an illegal racket run by her husband Jeetender, which resulted in more than 1,000 fraudulent visa applications, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. A police raid at the couple's house in October 2011 turned up almost $500,000 in cash, which was enough to charge the couple. But Mr and Ms Ajjan were able to flee the country because the Immigration Department failed to seize passports or ensure a criminal charge was laid quickly. The couple were also able to wire $1.2 million to India in the days after the raid and before they fled to India. Secret briefings from the Immigration Department, obtained by the Sydney Morning Herald, reported that investigators thought Ms Ajjan should be charged for dealing ‘with proceeds of crime of a value exceeding $100,000', which carries a penalty of up to 20 years in jail. Ms Ajjan and her husband are now living in Delhi and Australian authorities are attempting to recover the $1.2 million she transferred to India, which is believed to be the proceeds of crime, but the Australian Federal Police has indicated the money may be difficult to recover.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . In 2018 Nasa’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will take flight to help us understand more about the universe. But Nasa has already begun to lay out plans for their next space observatory in the hope of one day tracking down alien life. Called the Advanced Telescope Large-Aperture Space Telescope (Atlast), the mission concept builds upon key technologies developed for Hubble and the JWST. This artist's rendition shows a possible design of a potential successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. A Nasa-led team of experts in now investigating the viability of this conceptual mission, called the Advanced Telescope Large-Aperture Space Telescope (Atlast) One hundred million worlds in our galaxy are able to host alien life, according to a ‘conservative’ prediction by Nasa. And the space agency claims that we will be able to find that life within the next 20 years, with a high chance it will be outside our solar system. During a public talk yesterday in Washington, the space agency outlined a roadmap to search for life in the universe using a number of current and future telescopes. 'Do we believe there is life beyond Earth?' said former astronaut and Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden during a talk earlier this month in Washington. 'I would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone.' A team led by scientists and engineers at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland is now studying the scientific and technical requirements and costs associated with building the telescope. 'Conceptually, Atlast would leverage the technological advances pioneered by the Webb telescope, such as deployable, large segmented-mirror arrays,' said Dr Mark Clampin, Atlast study scientist and JWST’s project scientist. They add that, while Hubble and JWST will last for many years into the future, the agency is already looking ahead to the telescope and instrument requirements needed to answer the questions posed in Nasa’s 30-year vision. The 30-year vision has three main goals: Are we alone, how did we get here and how does the universe work. 'One of the killer apps currently planned for Atlast is the ability to detect signatures of life in the atmospheres of Earth-like planets in the solar neighborhood,' Dr Clampin said. While . other observatories will image larger exoplanets, they would not have . Atlast’s advanced ability to identify chemicals that may indicate the . presence of life in these far-flung, Earth-size worlds. Atlast’s large primary mirror would enable other scientific investigations, too. In . addition to studying star and galaxy formation in detail, Atlast would . be able to resolve stars in galaxies more than 10 million light-years . away and star-formation regions of sizes greater than 325 light years . anywhere in the universe. Look familiar? Atlast would be a successor to the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), illustration shown, which is due to launch in 2018. One of Atlast's primary goals will be to address Nasa's 30-year vision, which questions whether we are alone in the universe or not and also how the cosmos truly works . To achieve these ambitious goals, the observatory needs to be thermally and mechanically very stable, which can be achieved by operating in the Sun-Earth L2 orbit - the same orbit chosen for the JWST. It might also be equipped with a star shade to mask the light of distant stars, which will help it spot Earth-like planets in orbit. But perhaps more importantly, it would have to carry a significantly larger primary mirror - one even larger than the JWST’s, which will be the largest segmented mirror ever flown by Nasa. The team is studying the viability of a 33-foot (10-meter) glass or carbon-fiber segmented mirror, which would give the telescope a larger light-gathering surface, but still fit inside the fairing of an existing launch vehicle. For comparison, JWST is to be equipped with a 21-foot (6.5-meter) segmented primary mirror. 'This gives [Atlast] seventeen times greater light-gathering capability than Hubble’s mirror,' added Dr Carl Stahle, a Goddard engineer who is leading the team evaluating the technologies needed to pull off the Atlast mission. And Dr Harley Thronson, the Goddard senior scientist for Advanced Concepts in Astrophysics and Atlast study scientist, added: 'Atlast would achieve critically important science goals not possible with ground-based observatories or with any other planned space missions. 'Now is the time to plan for the future.'","Nasa scientists in Maryland have revealed plans for a new giant telescope .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Re-examination of a 100,000-year-old human skull found 35 years ago in Northern China suggests they were closer than thought in physiology to Neanderthals. A study has revealed the surprising presence of an inner-ear formation long thought to occur only in Neanderthals. And it lends further credence to the theory that Neanderthals were wiped out through interbreeding with other humans. A skull in China has been found with a trait once thought unique to Neanderthals. The Xujiayao 15 temporal bone is shown here with the extracted temporal labyrinth, an inner-ear formation thought long gone by 100,000 years ago. It is also shown with its position in the temporal bone . They . are often depicted as dim-witted evolutionary losers, but Neanderthals . were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains, a previous study by the University of Colorado Museum and Leiden University suggests. Instead, . it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of . interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors, . scientists believe. An . analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years stripped . away some of the myths surrounding Neanderthals and revealed they were . more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought. The . differences between the two human sub-species are not enough on their . own to account for the demise of the Neanderthals, said the US and Dutch . researchers. Interbreeding . could be one reason why Neanderthals vanished, according to the . scientists. They were not so much driven to extinction as assimilated. Evidence . of the two mixing can be seen in the fossil record. Some human-like . characteristics have been found in late Neanderthal fossils, and . conversely, Neanderthal features have been seen in early specimens of . modern humans in Europe. Study co-author Erik Trinkaus, PhD, a physical anthropology professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said the discovery 'places into question' how humans from the Pleistocene period (2.6 million to 11,700 years ago) dispersed. 'It suggests, instead, that the later phases of human evolution were more of a labyrinth of biology and peoples than simple lines on maps would suggest,' he said. The study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is based on recent micro-CT scans of a fossilised human skull found during 1970s excavations at the Xujiayao site in China’s Nihewan Basin. 'We were completely surprised,' Trinkaus contiued. 'We fully expected the scan to reveal a temporal labyrinth that looked much like a modern human one, but what we saw was clearly typical of a Neanderthal.' Instead the researchers found an arrangement of semicircular canals in the ear that places into question whether this was unique to Neanderthals. The . presence of this particular arrangement of the semicircular canals in . the temporal labyrinth had previously been considered enough to securely . identify fossilised skull fragments as being from a Neanderthal. This . pattern is present in almost all of the known Neanderthal labyrinths. It has been widely used as a marker to set them apart from both earlier . and modern humans. The . discovery the later humans have the same trait, however, could now call . into question whether other fossilised remains truly belonged to . Neanderthals. And it also raises more questions about where Neanderthals lived, as previously they were thought to live almost entirely in Europe . This diagram of the inner-ear shows the temporal labyrinth in yellow. The presence of this arrangement of canals had previously been thought enough to confirm a skull as belonging to a Neanderthal, but that now appears to not be the case and suggests they may have interbred with early humans . A previous study by the University of Colorado Museum and Leiden University said it was likely that Neanderthals (stock image shown) disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding with our early modern human ancestors, based on analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years . The skull at the centre of this study, known as Xujiayao 15, was found along with an assortment of other human teeth and bone fragments, all of which seemed to have characteristics typical of an early non-Neanderthal form of late archaic humans. Trinkaus, who has studied Neanderthal and early human fossils from around the globe, said this discovery only adds to the rich confusion of theories that attempt to explain human origins, migrations patterns and possible interbreedings. 'The study of human evolution has always been messy, and these findings just make it all the messier,' Trinkaus said. 'It shows that human populations in the real world don’t act in nice simple patterns.' Trinkaus also explains how migration patterns between Eastern Asia and Western Europe took thousands of years to play out, further complicating matters. 'This study shows that you can’t rely on one anatomical feature or one piece of DNA as the basis for sweeping assumptions about the migrations of hominid species from one place to another,' he concluded. The discovery of this skull in Asia, rather than Europe, also raises more questions about where Neanderthals lived, as previously they were thought to live almost entirely in Europe. Shown is a map of their distribution in the times they were believed to inhabit Earth .

An Anaheim, California teen died on Monday after possibly overdosing on drugs at an electronic music festival over the weekend. The Los Angeles Coroner's Office identified the victim as 19-year-old Emily Tran, who tested positive for methamphetamine and ecstasy at the hospital before her death. Tran was first admitted to the health tent at the HARD Summer music concert around 8:30pm on Sunday, the second day of the event which showcases electronic and hip-hop musicians at Whittier Narrows Regional Park in South Menlo. Officials say Tran started having seizures and was taken to the Greater El Monte Community Hospital where she later passed away around 5:40am Monday morning. An official cause of death has not yet been reported, as the coroner must first conduct toxicology tests which could take weeks. Tran was the only fatality at the two-day festival, but someone did die of natural causes at the event last year. The event's organizers confirmed Tran's death saying she 'had seizures' on Sunday 'and sadly passed away'. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to her family and friends,' the statement added. One part of the security included a place to anonymously dump narcotics before entering the event.

Four-year-old Raudhatul Jannah and her seven-year-old brother were separated from their parents while holding onto a floating piece of wood in the tsunami waters, when it hit her West Aceh home on December 26, 2004, reported DPA. Jannah's mother Jamaliah, 42, and her husband survived and searched for their children, but stopped after one month, assuming the children had died in the devastating tsunami. Scroll down for video . Raudhatul Jannah (centre) is embraced by her mother Jamaliah (left) and grandmother (right) after being reunited in Meulaboh, Indonesia 10 years after they were separated . In June, Jamaliah's brother spotted a girl who bore a resemblance to Jannah walking home from school and made inquiries about her. He discovered that she had been swept from Aceh in the 2004 tsunami to remote islands southwest of the province. The girl was rescued by a fisherman and brought back to the fisherman's mother, now an elderly woman, who named the girl Weni and raised her. Jamaliah and her husband visited the girl in the inland town of Blangpidie in the Aceh Barat Daya district in late June and found she was their daughter. 'My husband and I are very happy. I am so grateful to God for reuniting us with our child after 10 years of being separated,' said Jamaliah. 'My heart beat so fast when I saw her. I hugged her and she hugged me back and felt so comfortable in my arms,' she said. Jamaliah also said she could not stop the 'tears from flowing' during the reunion.

Jannah was reunited with her family on Wednesday and returned to her hometown. 'My husband and I are very happy we have found her. This is a miracle from God,' Jamaliah told DPA by telephone from Meulaboh, the main town in West Aceh. Jamaliah said she was willing to take a DNA test to prove the girl was her daughter, but that she had no doubt the girl was hers, recognising her as soon as she saw her. 'If anyone is in doubt, I'm ready for DNA tests,' she told DPA. Jamaliah told Indonesian newspaper Harian Terbit she was very confident that Weni, as she is now known, is her child because of her characteristic facial features, though Jamaliah says Jannah's skin colour has changed, because she has been working in the sun helping her foster mother collect shells. The newspaper reported that Jannah is 'cheerful' but does not talk much and noted that although she is 14 years old Jannah is in fourth grade because of learning difficulties resulting from the trauma of the tsunami. Jamaliah said she is willing to take a DNA test to prove that Weni (right), as she is now known, is the daughter who was taken from her in the tsunami waters 10 years ago .

The family were torn apart when the tsunami hit their house. They clung to a floating plank of wood through the tsunami waters, but two of the couple's children, Jannah and her seven-year-old brother slipped from their parents' grasp. It is understood the couple has another child, named Azhari, who was not separated from them during the tsunami. The parents moved from Aceh a year after the tsunami because their property had been destroyed, Harian Terbit reported. Jannah told her mother she and her brother, Arif Pratama Rangkuti, survived and were stranded on Banyak Island, but his whereabouts are unknown. The family are going to travel to the sparsely inhabited island 40 km off the coast  to look for their son, who would now be 17.

A Daytona Beach, Florida mother of seven was arrested on Wednesday after she was caught smoking crack and drinking alcohol while watching her 1-month-old daughter. Police found 37-year-old Bobbre Williams outside a convenience store on South Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard where she even admitted to breastfeeding her infant while drunk and high. Williams is currently being held without bond, while her child was taken to the hospital for treatment. It's unknown what condition the baby is in. The sad incident happened in the early hours of Wednesday morning when a witness approached Williams sitting on a sidewalk outside the MLK Mart and offered her a place to stay for a night. Williams turned the offer down and instead asked to buy crack-cocaine off the anonymous woman. Fearing for the child's safety, the witness called the Department of Children and Families hotline. Another witness later told police that she encountered Williams behind the convenience store, smoking crack and drinking alcohol while holding her baby. That witness said she knew Williams from a shelter, which Williams had left the previous day. When police arrived at the scene at around 3:20am, Williams admitted smoking crack and drinking alcohol while breastfeeding the child. But she put up a struggled when officers tried to take the baby away from her, clutching the newborn to her chest. Looking to buy: A witness reported seeing Williams outside this convenience store where she was asking to buy crack while holding her infant daughter . Officers eventually succeeded in taking custody of the small child, which was then transported to Halifax Health Medical Center of Daytona Beach. The infant girl's condition is unknown, but cops say she gasped for air after the struggle. Williams was subsequently arrested and charged with aggravated child abuse, battery on a law enforcement officer, possession of cocaine and child neglect. When officers searched through her diaper bag, they found a cake-like substance that tested positive for cocaine. She is being held without bond at the Volusia County jail. Williams has a lengthy arrest record stretching back to August 2003 for drug and child abuse charges and was on probation when she was arrested Wednesday.

"By . Ashley Collman . A wide-spread rumor that retired baseball all-star Kevin Mitchell decapitated his girlfriend's cat has been further substantiated after ex-Mets teammate Darryl Strawberry confirmed the incident. The baseball urban legend goes back to1999, when Strawberry and Mitchell's fellow teammate Dwight 'Doc' Gooden detailed the horrifying incident in his autobiography 'Heat'. While Mitchell has denied the story for years, in an interview with Huffington Post Live on Tuesday, Strawberry said it was all true. Did he do it? Former Mets player Kevin Mitchell decapitated his girlfriend's cat, according to urban legend. That rumor received more backing this week when ex-teammate Darryl Strawberry confirmed the story. Mitchell pictured in  1986 above . 'That's a pretty good story. I think that's pretty accurate Kevin Mitchell did do that,' he said. 'Kevin Mitchell, he's a different type of guy. Great guy, super teammate...I guess he figured that the girlfriend was acting a little crazy, so I'll kill her cat.' Strawberry appeared on HuffPo Live with his wife Tracy as they promote their new book 'The Imperfect Marriage: Help For Those Who Think It's Over' Strawberry was close with both Mitchell and Gooden during their time on the Mets, and all three were part of the 1986 World Series-winning team.

Strawberry pictured visiting the Today Show on Tuesday (left) According to Gooden's description in Heat, the cat incident happened sometime in the mid-80s when he showed up at Mitchell's house with a friend unannounced. He says the two accidentally interrupted a fight Mitchell and his live-in girlfriend were having, and were ordered not to leave the house as the couple bickered. 'When we got there, I realized Kevin was both drunk and angry, a dangerous combination. He was holding a twelve-inch knife in his hands, having an argument with his live-in girlfriend. Kevin was right in the girl's face, screaming at the top of his lungs,' Gooden recalls in the book. Champions: Mitchell, Strawberry and Gooden were all part of the 1986 World Series-winning Mets team . Gooden says both he and Mitchell's girlfriend tried to clam him down but he couldn't be persuaded. 'Mitch turned to her and raised his anger to yet another level. Still holding the knife in his right hand, he grabbed his girlfriend's little cat, who had the misfortune to be walking near his feet at that very moment. 'In one awful sweep of his hand, Mitch pulled the cat's head back, exposing its throat. '""You think I'm kidding when I say don't ever fuck with me?"" he shouted. Before the girl could answer, Mitch took the knife to the cat, and cut its head off. Clean.' In 2002, Mitchell spoke about the incident with author Jeff Pearlman, who was writing a book about the 1986 Mets team. 'How could I cut off a cat's head with a kitchen knife? Hell, I love animals,' Mitchell stated.","The rumor started in 1999, when formers Mets pitcher Doc Gooden talked about witnessing the horrifying incident in his autobiography .

The college-tuition sized tip was received last Wednesday morning, just after 7am, but an employee didn't notice until the end of her shift. Brooklyn Bagel Works owners Peter Horylev and Scott Schulman quikcly called the card company to stop the charge, believing it was a mistake. Schulman told MailOnline that he hasn't had contact with the customer, but heard the regular told a local reporter he only meant to tip 10 per cent. Scroll down for video . Too good to be true: A customer of Brooklyn Bridge Bagel Works in Chico, California gave a $43,231.52 tip last week, but store owners believe it was a mistake . Generous: The California store recently started using a new tipping system which the owners believe may be to blame for the tipping mishap . When the owners called the card processing company, they were told not to worry, the charge likely wouldn't clear. 'But then when they were on the phone they checked and sure enough it had been authorized and had gone through,' co-owner Horylev told KHSL. Horylev and his business partner then told the company to reverse the tip and just charge for the $8 order of a egg sandwich with a side of potatoes and coffee . The owners still don't know how the tip was entered, but believe it may be the result of a new tipping system for car users. Accident: The new tipping system involves customers pressing a  button for what percentage they would like to add. the co-owners of the bagel shop believe the customer accidentally pressed a button to enter a dollar amount and accidentally put in a seven-figure tip . No contact: Pictured above is co-owner Peter Horylev. He and his partner Scott Schulman has not yet made contact with the customer who gave the accidental tip . Instead of filling in a number on the receipt, customers are now asked to press a button on the card reader, denoting what tip percentage they would like to give. But the options are only 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 20 per cent. The only way the customer would have been able to give such a hefty tip is by hitting another button which allows them to enter in a dollar amount. 'Somehow they just must have gotten befuddled and hit the button and thought they were done and just kept hitting buttons,' Horylev said. Since starting the new tip process two months ago, Horylev says his customers have been a bit confused and the system sometimes times out. But she says there hasn't been any issues with customers entering in the wrong amount.","The owners of Brooklyn Bridge Bagel Works in Chico, California called the card company to stop the charge after noticing the astronomical tip .

"By . Ashley Collman . Suicide is suspected in the death of an experienced skydiver who died in a jump in southern California yesterday. The victim of the Wednesday morning sky dive has been identified as 53-year-old divorce Thomas Steve Clark of Jamul, who had logged more than 10,000 jumps in his three decades of skydiving. Clark was jumping with Sky Dive San Diego around 10:30am when his parachute failed to deploy and he fell to his death near the 13531 block of Otay Lakes Road in Jamul. Scroll down for video . Deadly fall: An experienced skydiver died Wednesday morning when his parachute failed to deploy on a jump near San Diego, California. The victim has been identified as Thomas Steve Clark, 53, of Jamul . Sky Dive San Diego owner Buzz Fink says Clark was experienced and was jumping with brand new equipment that should have deployed his parachute automatically if he wasn't able to pull the chord. Fink says all sky divers are required to wear the equipment on jumps with his company. That leads Fink to believe that Clark knowingly turned the device off and jumped to his death on purpose. 'We later discovered that the gentleman has evidently been depressed and from descriptions of events we believe it was a suicide,' Fink told City News Service. Fink says before the jump, those on the plane with Clark didn't notice behavior out of the ordinary. On purpose: Clark was jumping with Sky Dive San Diego on Wednesday, which is owned by Buzz Fink (pictured). Fink believes Clark committed suicide since the parachute should have deployed automatically. He believes Clark turned that safety equipment off before the jump . 'He was  normal as he normally was...not happy, not sad, just kinda in between,' Fink said. Clark had been sky diving for the past 30 years, and came out to jump with Sky Dive San Diego three to four times a month, Fink said. During those outings, he would make three to 10 jumps a day and acted as a 'mentor to other jumpers'. He reportedly worked as a handyman and had months worth of jobs booked at the time of his death. Clark is survived by a teenage son. •  For confidential help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or click here •  For confidential support on suicide matters in the UK, call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or click here .","Thomas Steve Clark of Jamul, California fell to his death in a skydive Wednesday morning .

"By . Ashley Collman . The 47-year-old Georgia pastor turned financial adviser who faked his own death after embezzling millions from his clients has spoken out to detail his 18 months on the run. Aubrey Lee Price went missing in June 2012 after sending suicide notes to his friends and family and boarding a ferry from Key West to Fort Meyers, Florida. Though his body was never found, the married father-of-four was officially pronounced dead six months later, believed to have jumped off the ferry and died in the ocean. But Price stayed on the boat and started a new life before he was arrested on December 31, 2013, after cops pulled him over in Brunswick, Georgia because the tint on his car was too dark. In an interview with Esquire, Price has revealed that he initially planned to commit suicide when he boarded the ferry, and that he had no plan for his new life after deciding to stay on the boat. Before and after: Aubrey Lee Price faked his own death in June 2012 after embezzling millions from his clients. In an interview with Esquire, Price details his 18 months on the run. Pictured on the left before his disappearance, and in a mugshot after his December 2013 arrest . 'I don’t know why I didn’t kill myself,' Price said. 'Once it got dark on that boat and no one was there, I threw everything over except the backpack with my driver’s license and wedding ring. 'I threw all my credit cards away. I had, like, eighteen dollars left to my name after paying for postage at the Key West post office and paying the taxicab driver.' After landing back in Florida, he traveled to South America where he worked for a former business associate in Venezuela. While Price says he only interacted with his friend's legal business before, when he returned to South America he started helping the man with his illegal cocaine smuggling business. In the interview, Price describes the moment his friend revealed his drug business by showing him his warehouse 'stuffed full of coke'. He ended up working in the drug smuggling business for a while, before eventually moving back to the U.S. Abandoned: Price left behind four children and wife Rebekah (pictured) when he faked his suicide. He is currently serving a 30 year prison sentence . Price talked about missing his children but used emotional language to describe being separated from his dog. 'I longed to be with my dog again, a golden retriever named Holly Jolly. I probably won’t see my dog ever again. And she was my best friend,' he said. Back in the U.S., Price downloaded software to make fake IDs and says he had about six false identities including both foreign and local aliases. During that time, he says he went by several names including Diesel, Gator, Javier, and Jason. He spent some of his time missing cage-fighting in New York, which is also how he developed a love for marijuana which he says he took to relieve body pain. Over 200 marijuana plants were later discovered at the home he was renting in Georgia. He managed to stay off the street by rooming with prostitutes in motels, but maintains he was chaste the whole time. Green: Price says he started using marijuana after becoming a cage-fighter. Over 200 plants were discovered in the home he rented in Georgia, after his arrest . Price says one of the most disappointing aspects of faking his death, was learning his FBI reward was just $20,000. 'I was disappointed in the reward for me—it was only $20,000! I was on the FBI’s top ten list! Come on, put some money out there! I wanted to be number one,' he said. But Price says it was tough keeping the charade up, and he didn't like his life on the run. He was driving his car the day he got cut, and happened to have a bit of an emotional crisis behind the wheel. 'I was beating my steering wheel, angry at God. I felt like I wasn’t making any progress towards restitution. 'I’m riding up I-95. And I remember saying, Lord, where are you? I said that, like, ten times. And then I looked up and there were blue lights behind me. I said, Thanks, Lord. That’s where you are. 'So I pulled over eighteen months after I disappeared. And that was it.' Following his arrest, Price plead guilty to fraud charges and is now serving a 30 year prison sentence.

By the time paramedics arrived, the man was able to state his name and 'I'm cold' before going into another seizure. A friend told doctors that the man had recently smoked a synthetic marijuana called 'Crazy Monkey'. When . he arrived at the hospital, the man became so severely agitated that he . had to be physically restrained and was taken to an intensive care unit . for monitoring. The . next day, he was still showing signs of confusion but was able to . confirm to doctors that he smoked up to three 'pots' a day of Crazy . Monkey, but denied knowing how his dog ingested the drug. Dr Hallam Melville Gugelman, a medical toxicology fellow who treated the patient told CBS News that he believes the pet ate the substance.

The . drug goes by a variety of names such as Spice, K2, and Skunk and has a . laundry list of negative side effects including anxiety, delusions, . psychosis, acute kidney injury, and stroke.

"By . Ashley Collman . Gone with the Wind remains one of the most beloved films of all time, due to the unforgettable love-triangle story of Southern Belle Scarlett O'Hara, her neighbor Ashley Wilkes and eventual husband Rhett Butler. But there's another character of the film that has fallen by the wayside over the last 75 years - 'Tara' the stately O'Hara family plantation home that serves as the backdrop of the Civil War-era movie. While the movie-set facade for Tara remained on the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer back lot for several years, it eventually was purchased and shipped to Georgia where it remained all but forgotten for three decades as the pieces wore into disrepair. Reconstruction: Historian Peter Bonner is working to restore the set pieces of Tara, the Southern home that was used as the backdrop of Gone with the Wind . Hollywood history: Tara is the fictional home of the O'Hara family in classic film Gone with the Wind. Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivien Leigh, pictured outside the facade for the house in the movie . Claim to fame: The set for Gone with the Wind was used as a backdrop for Western movies until it was dismantled in 1960 . Now, local historian Peter Bonner is working to display the set pieces in hopes of teaching tourists about the parallels between Gone with the Wind and author Margaret Mitchell's real-life experiences growing up in the South during Reconstruction. The shell of the home was built at MGM's Selznick Studios, and was used for several years as a backdrop for other Western movies filmed there. The set was dismantled in 1960, though the studio continued to mislead tourists for several years into thinking another southern mansion on 'back lot 2' was the frame used in the famous film. Tara was first purchased by group Southern Attractions, inc in 1959 who had plans to turn the set into a museum and tourist attraction. The group was unsuccessful however, due to Gone with the Wind author Margaret Mitchell's refusal to license anything that would capitalize off the novel. Eventually the pieces were purchased in 1979 by Betty Talmadge, the ex-wife of former Georgia Senator Herman Talmadge and daughter-in-law to one of the state's former governors. Resting place: Betty Talmadge, the ex-wife of a former Georgia senator, purchased Tara in 1979 and ever since they've been stored in an old dairy barn on her property . The show must go on: Mrs Talmadge passed away in 2005, but historian Bonner has continued to work to restore the pieces she left behind . Mrs Talmadge had the door of the set restored and lent for permanent display at the Margaret Mitchell house and museum ten years later, where it remains today. The rest of the facade - including windows, shutters, cornice, steps, and a breezeway - still sits in an old dairy barn in Mrs Talmadge's backyard, though she passed away in 2005. Mrs Talmadge's home in Lovejoy, Georgia was just down the road from Lovejoy Plantation, which is rumored to be the inspiration for character Ashley Wilkes' family plantation in the book. Before her death, Mrs Talmadge befriended local historian Bonner who started to help restoring the pieces. His ultimate goal is to turn Tara into a museum, though he told MailOnline he doesn't plan on rebuilding the house as it was used on set. New life: Bonner doesn't plan to rebuild the home, but instead is working to showcase the pieces with wooden supports. Above, some of Tara's signature olive-green shutters . Showing off: Bonner currently gives tours 3-4 times a month for groups of about 15 who are interested in the set . Attraction: Bonner hopes to ultimately restore the pieces so that they can be showcased for years to come . Since the pieces have been stored in poor condition for decades, he is instead working to showcase them like set pieces on a stage, with wooden supports. Now that some of that work is done, Bonner has been receiving a flood of interest in the set and conducts about three to four tours a month for groups of 15-20 people. Bonner says the tourists come from all over the U.S. as well as Italy, France, Germany and other foreign countries. He also recently finished writing a small book on the set, titled The Official Guide to the 'Saving Tara' project', which he has already sent to press. While he sees himself retiring from the tourism business in a few years, Bonner hopes to restore the set pieces enough that they can continue to be showcased for years to come.

Adam Richman, who has a number TV food shows, made a public apology on Tuesday when he appeared on Today with Hoda and Kathy (right) New body: Travel Channel has pulled new-show Man Finds Food after host Adam Richman used hateful words to hit back at critics on Instagram. Richman got defensive when users called him out for using the pro-anorexia term 'thinspiration' to describe a photo of his dramatic weight loss. He has lost 70lb since 2011 . Richman said: 'Simply put, I got into a silly social . media argument, and I lashed out in just a really inappropriate, really . crude way, and...I'm incredibly sorry about my actions. 'Even more so, I know . that my mom raised me better than that, and I was raised to know human . beings don't talk that way to each other, and if you're someone on . television, it's irresponsible.' The Travel . Channel pulled RIchman's new show Man Finds Foods this month due to the online spat. Thinspiration . is a term used to describe online posts which encourage eating . disorders, and have been banned on sites like Facebook and Yahoo. Richman . seemed unaware of the term's significance when he included it in the . caption of a photo showing his dramatic weight loss earlier last month. So . when Instagram users started criticizing him, Richman got defensive and . shot back with profanity - in one case going so far as to tell one user . to commit suicide. Proud: The controversy started early last month when Richman posted this picture of his recent weight loss with the hastag 'thinspiration' Out of the loop: Richman seemed unaware that 'thinspiration' is a term used to describe pictures and quotes that promote eating disorders in online communities . Video Source Travel Channel . Though Richman has since apologized for the comments, it wasn't enough to keep his show. The Travel Channel announced that Man Finds Food has been postponed. It was slated to debut on July 2. Richman became famous for hosting show Man V Food (also on Travel Channel), a show where he traveled the U.S. to compete in food-eating competitions. Since the show ended, Richman began a healthier lifestyle and has since experienced a dramatic weight loss. Proud of his new body, Richman posted a photo earlier last month in which he's seen wearing an old pair of suit pants that are now much too big. 'Had ordered this suit from a Saville Row tailor over a year ago. Think I’m gonna need to take it in a little…. #Victory #EyesOnThePrize #AnythingIsPossible #fitness #transformation #thinspiration,' Richman wrote. When one user called him out for using the negative term, he shot back with a comment reading 'DILLIGAF' - which stands for 'Do I look like I give a f***?' When one user tried to explain the significance of 'thinspiration', Richman shot back with 'DILLIGAF?' - meaning 'Do I look like I give a f***?' Richman sent that comment to a friend of Amber Sarah, a 27-year-old fat activist who sought to put the foodie in his place. Online row: Fat activist Amber Sarah, 27 (pictured), was one of the many Instagram users that tried to explain thinspiration to Richman. He called her a c*** . In a post on her blog Adipose Activist, Sarah described how Richman first ignored her comment on his page. She then wrote a post on her personal Instagram, asking others to 'tell him that eating disorders are not a joke and nothing to take lightly'. That's when Richman got even more angry, calling Ms Sarah a 'c***' in a message that subsequently got deleted off his page. But that didn't stop him from using the hateful word again in yet another post on Ms Sarah's personal Instagram. When she told him he needed to apologize, Richman wrote back saying to 'give me a f****** break.' 'If anyone acts like a c*** I'll call them one. It's not misogyny, it's calling a spade a spade. Maybe you're the one being aggressive & unfair - and yes, if my use of the hashtag offended you, it was unintentional & for that I'm sorry.' When two of Ms Sarah's friends wrote to Richman, he responded similarly. 'Seriously - grab a razor blade & draw a bath. I doubt anyone will miss you,' Richman wrote to Instagram user @_bechen . To user @thefattestfox Richman said: 'oh eat a bag of s***, dummy. No apology is coming.' Richman did end up apologizing though, when he tweeted a statement saying: 'Yes. I've responded to internet hate recently with vile words directed at those hating me. I am sorry. I should know better & will do better.' Proof: Sarah shared screen shots of her online altercation with Richman in a blog post . 'Grab a razor blade and draw a bath': Richman went so far as to tell one of Ms Sarah's friends to commit suicide . Ms Sarah says she has no problem with Richman's weight loss, just his use of a damaging words that has an even greater effect since he is a celebrity with more than 92,000 followers on Instagram. 'As a public figure, even if you have a personal Instagram (Adam has 94,000 followers) you need to understand that the things you say will be scrutinized, and the words you use have meaning,' Ms Sarah wrote. 'You need to be extra careful to think about not what you mean when you say things, but how other people will interpret them. And in a society where eating disorders are at an all-time high, thinspiration is a loaded word.' Travel Channel has replaced Man Finds Food with a show about grilling.

"By . Ashley Collman . LeBron James has not only won back the hearts of Cleveland by rejoining the Cavaliers, but America as a whole according to a newly-released poll. The survey, conducted by Harris Interactive, ranks the basketball MVP as the nation's favorite athlete, knocking legend Michael Jordan off the number one spot. Though Jordan hasn't played basketball in more than a decade, he has remained in the top 10 every year. Mr Popular: A new poll ranks LeBron James as America's favorite professional athlete. Pictured above in 2010, during his original run with the Cleveland Cavaliers. He recently announced he would be returning to the Cavs after winning two championships with the Miami Heat . Everyone still likes Mike: LeBron may have replaced Jordan as America's favorite athlete, but he's still ranked number one among women and GenXers . Surprisingly, the survey was conducted before LeBron announced he would be returning to Cleveland, which means he may be even more popular now than the survey currently reflects. LeBron was kicked out of the top 10 for an entire year in 2011, after making the  then-unpopular decision to leave the Cavs to join the Miami Heat. However, after winning back to back championships in 2012 and 2013, LeBron made it back onto the list and last year was ranked second. The poll also included a list for favorite female sports athletes with tennis all-star Serena Williams topping the list.

Serena exited early at Wimbledon (pictured above) this year, and was forced to forfeit in the doubles championship with her sister Venus (ranked number three on the list) when she contracted a viral illness . The survey revealed some interesting differences in who different Americans considered their favorite athlete. While men overall preferred LeBron James, women were bigger fans of Jordan. Race also played a role, with white Americans choosing soon-to-retire New York Yankee Derek Jeter as their favorite athlete while Hispanics preferred LeBron. For African Americans, it was a toss-up between LeBron and Jordan. Jeter was also the favorite athlete of older people, over the age of 68 and Republicans. Democrats, meanwhile, preferred Jordan and for Independents it was LeBron . Farewell: Derek Jeter may be retiring after this season, but he remains a favorite on the list. He ranked three overall, but was number one for older Americans, white Americans, Republicans and those who live on the East Coast. pictured above at the MLB All-Star game which took pace Tuesday . Millennials and Baby Boomers both agreed on their love of LeBron while Gen Xers ranked Jordan, who dominated the NBA during their childhood, as their favorite. There were also differences regionally, with Americans in the Midwest and South ranking Lebron as their favorite, which is perhaps unsurprising considering he has played for teams in both regions. Those in the West stayed true to Jordan and Jeter was number one for baseball-loving East Coasters. Gender:Men - LeBron JamesWomen - Michael Jordan .

"By . Ashley Collman . A semi-retired Hollywood cameraman says he invented the celebrity selfie, and has been taking shots of himself with the rich and famous for more than two decades. Lester Wisbrod, 67, recently claimed ownership of the trend in an interview with the Los Angeles Times, showing off his more than 150 photographs with the likes of Jennifer Aniston, Ronald Reagan and Mike Tyson that he calls 'silly shots' 'Everybody's making a big fuss about . selfies — selfie this, selfie that … give me a break.

Semi-retired Hollywood cameraman Lester Wisbrod is taking credit for inventing the celebrity selfie . Wisbrod says his selfie days started when he entered the TV business in 1968, getting paid $2 dollars an hour working to film 'Romper Room' in Las Vegas. That job led to several others in the area and eventually he moved to Los Angeles for more work in 1979. It was in Hollywood that he started working on shows like 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous' and 'A Current Affair' where he began to rub shoulders with the movers and shakers in the entertainment industry. Stepping forward: Wisbrod decided to claim credit for the celebrity selfie so as not to become 'roadkill on the history highway'. Pictured above with actor Woody Harrelson . Working man: Wisbrod met most of his subjects while working as a cameraman in Hollywood. Pictured above with athlete Mike Tyson . Successful: Wisbrod was only ever denied a picture once, by M*A*S*H actress Loretta Swit. Pictured above with actress Jennifer Aniston . His first selfie was taken in 1981 with humorist Art Buchwald and shot on a traditional film camera. Wisbrod went on to take about 150 selfies with celebrities, and credits his success with first chatting up the stars he was introduced to on set. He says he was only turned down once, by M*A*S*H actress Loretta Swit, who would only agree to the picture if someone else took the shot. 'I awkwardly withdrew,' Wisbrod recalls. Legend: For more than two decades, Wisbord took pictures of himself with some 150 celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston and Mike Tyson . Since selfies require the the subject and cameraman to join close, Wisbrod says the resulting photographs are more intimate and put the celebrities 'in a whole different mood'. In many of the shots, the celebrities wrap their arms around Wisbrod as if he's a close friend. And the shots have made for quite a few good stories. When he approached Steven Spielberg for a snap, the famous director cautioned him about his angle. 'Are you sure you want to take it that way?' Speilberg asked. 'You may not get another chance.' Comfortable: Since the subject and cameraman have to get close for a selfie to work, Wisbrod says the selfies are more intimate and put the celebrities at ease. Pictured above with actress Suzanne Somers . Wisbrod takes a snap with legendary actor Patrick Stewart . Golden Guy: Wisbrod pictured with a younger Betty White . But the picture came out fine, just like his shot with President Ronald Reagan, once he was out of office. That shot was more difficult to take since Wisbrod had to make his way past Secret Service. There are also some awkward memories, like the time he approached Bill Pullman who thought he was 'macking' on his girlfriend, something Wisbrod denies. Wisbrod  explained why he continued to document his run-ins with the rich and famous, saying it was a way to document his life after leaving his hometown. 'I came from East Oakland,' he said. 'People in East Oakland really don't get out and about into the . celebrity scene much. I did it so much I really kind of took it for . granted. In a way, I kind of miss it now.'","Lester Wisbrod, 67, has been taking selfies with celebrities since 1981 .

It's uncertain whether the ring she lost was on her left or right hand . Caught in the act: The ring turned up with carpet cleaner Henry Bernal took it to a gem appraiser after trying to sell the ring . That's when carpet cleaner Henry Bernal picked it up and took it home to his girlfriend, Christina Gonzales, law enforcement officials said. The couple then took the ring to Kevin Jewelers, but when the store offered to buy the jewel, they instead decided to get it certified by the Gemological Institute of America. However, the GIA notified cops once Bernal came in, since the gem already had a certification number. Bernal allegedly told cops that he didn't turn the ring in because he doesn't trust law enforcement. The theft is currently under investigatiomn by local police and the FBI.

"By . Ashley Collman . An enraged renter shot dead three people, barricaded himself in a home and opened fire in a standoff with police before surrendering to authorities in Pasadena, California Saturday afternoon. The suspect taken into custody has been identified as 44-year-old John Izeal Smith. Maria Theresa Aguiar, 59, is the only victim who has been identified so far. Police are waiting to release the names of the other two victims until they have notified family. The two injured in the incident, an unidentified man and woman, are reportedly being treated for non life-threatening injuries at the hospital. Scroll down for video . Deadly: A Pasadena neighborhood was shaken yesterday when a tenant-landlord dispute turned violent and three people were shot dead . Neighbors reported hearing shots fired around 4:20pm on the 1700 block of Summit Avenue. Police believe Smith, a renter, got into a dispute with his landlord that afternoon and pulled out a semi-automatic weapon. One of the victims, a man in his 70s, was found dead inside one of the homes, while Aguiar's body was found laying in the sidewalk to the side of that house. The third victim was an unidentified 'Good Samaritan' in his 20s who ran towards the shots, hoping to help the injured. Two other people, a man and woman in their 40s, were also injured and are being treated for minor to moderate injuries. Police received over 10 calls related to the shots fired, and the first responding officer was shot at as he tried to help one of the victims lying in the street. Victims: Two other people were injured in the incident and are reportedly recovering from non life-threatening injuries at the hospital . While Smith, barricaded in a home, continued to fire rounds at responding police vehicles, no police officer was injured in the incident. Eventually Smith called 911 and, after speaking with a dispatcher and hostage negotiator, decided to surrender to police. He was arrested and booked at Pasadena City Jail where he is currently being held on $1million bond. 'That is a deliberate act, apparently it's cowardly,' Pasadena Police Chief Phillip Sanchez said. 'He used a firearm to kill individuals who weren't armed and couldn't defend themselves. They had to run, literally, for their lives.' After police swept the house Smith barricaded himself in, they recovered his rifle as well as additional firearms he did not use in the attack. It's still unclear which house Smith was renting, but Aguiar is listed as owning a home on North Summit Street. Renter's dispute: It's still unclear which home Smith was renting in the neighborhood.

"By . Ashley Collman . A 23-year-old National Guardsman is suspected of carrying out a murder-suicide in Logan, Utah early Monday morning. Police believe solder Jared J Tolman broke into friend MacKenzie Madden's home on the edge of the Utah State University Campus shortly after midnight, and proceeded to shoot her dead along with her 25-year-old friend Johnathan Jacob Sadler. Thirty minutes later, police were called to an apartment just a few blocks away where Tolman allegedly walked into the living room and turned the gun on himself. Police say the same handgun was used in all three shootings and that they are not looking for any other suspects at the time. Scroll down for video . Before embarking on his killing spree, Jared Tolman, 23, left a suicide note at his home in Logan in which he admitted that what he was about to do was selfish . Targets? Tolman allegedly broke into 19-year-old friend Mackenzie Madden's (left) apartment and shot her dead along with her 25-year-old friend Johnathan Sadler (right) It's still unclear the relationship between the three young people. However, police say Tolman and Madden, a former police intern, were acquainted and were texting each other just prior to the shooting. Sadler was apparently visiting Madden at her apartment on the 600 block of E 500 N St when the incident happened. The door was broken down and both Sadler and Madden were shot several times. It's unclear whether Madden and Sadler, both Logan residents, were the intended targets but there was no one else in the immediate vicinity of the apartment.

"By . Ashley Collman . Crossing the line: University of Pennsylvania student Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie has written an essay detailing the inappropriate relationship her high school teacher Joe Koetters instigated . An English teacher who worked at two elite Los Angeles prep schools has quit his job after a former student published an essay last month, detailing the inappropriate relationship he instigated three years ago. Though Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie (now a rising sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania) didn't name the teacher or the high school she attended in her essay for xoJane, she told BuzzFeed that she received eight Facebook messages within hours from other former students who had the same issue with teacher Joe Koetters. Koetters taught English at the $35,000-a-year Marlborough School for 14 years, before leaving last year to teach at his alma-mater Polytechnic School. Amid the new allegations, Koetters has quit his job and now both schools are re-investigating the claims of sexual harassment. Gilbert-Lurie says Koetters crossed the student-teacher boundary when she was a 16-year-old junior, and asked to interview him for the school newspaper. He agreed, replying 'It's a date' to her email. When they met up later outside the school, she wrote that he dodged her questions and turned the conversation towards romantic poetry, saying he could lend her a favorite book of his. At the end of the conversation, his hands brushed against her knee. While Gilbert-Lurie said the flirting made her feel good at first, she became less comfortable with their relationship when he started getting more explicit in their email conversations. He said he knew how to draw a boundary with other students but not with her and talked about how her short uniform skirt made her 'so alluring'. So a few day later, Gilbert-Lurie wrote him saying they needed to stop so she could focus on finals and 'just being 16'. Koetters responded 'Ugh, Ok,' but continued to harass her in class and through email. That's when she decided to tell her parents. When Gilbert-Lurie and her parents went to the school to inform them about Koetters inappropriate behavior, the administration began an investigation. Accusations: Koetters taught at $35,000-a-year Marlborough School for 14 years. Several former students are now coming out to say that he sexually harassed them . Koetters was sent to sexual harassment training and stripped of his position as chair of the English department, but was not fired because it was a 'first-time offense'. But Buzzfeed discovered at least two complaints formally lodged against Koetters, not to mention all of the former students who contacted Gilbert-Lurie with similar stories after she published her essay. In 2005, a student lodged a complaint against Koetters but the administration found that the claims were unsubstantiated. Koetters received a second complaint in 2012, from a 2011 grad who accused him of bullying her about her writing. After publishing her essay, Gilbert-Lurie was contacted by several other former Marlborough students who had a similar relationship with Koetters but were too afraid to report his behavior to the administration. Most of these former students agreed to talk to Buzzfeed about their encounters with Koetters. One former student, identified as Mariah, says Koetters once told her: 'I love you in ways that are totally inappropriate for a teacher to love a student.' She also recalled the time they were discussing the book Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee, which is about an inappropriate relationship between an English professor and a student. Mariah talked about how she wanted to write an essay on the book, focusing on predators and prey. Out of the job: Koetters left Marlborough School in 2013 to start teaching at Polytechnic School, his alma mater. In a statement issued Sunday, the school says he is no longer employed . That's when Koetters told her, 'Just because someone is in a position of power over someone else doesn't mean the relationship can't be mutual.' 'He told me that if we had sex, it could be mutual, it could me love,' Mariah recalls. She says he then put his hand on her knee. Another 2012 graduate recalled how Koetters would use his power over female students to turn friends against each other. A former student identified as Stephanie says he turned their innocent conversations about help with class into a venting session where he would complain about his wife and kids. Stephanie says she felt like an adult when he talked to her about his problems, but knows how wrong it was in retrospect. 'Now that I'm close to my thirties, I realize how wrong the situation was and regret not speaking out,' she said. Koetters left Marlborough in 2013 to teach at another elite institution, Polytechnic School. Marlborough has released a statement saying they are re-investigating Koetters, but were not informed about the other claims from former students. Polytechnic says it did not know about the allegations, but Gilbert-Lurie's mother says she called them before Koetters was hired. On Sunday, Polytechnic issued a statement saying Koetters no longer works there and that they 'considered a range of information and perspectives' during the hiring process. Malborough School officials say they were never informed that Koetters touched Gilbert-Lurie's knee, a claim she refutes. The school has since notified the Los Angeles Police Department Child Protective Students about the allegations, and hired former US Attorney Debra Wong Yang to conduct an investigation. Dear Marlborough parents, alumnae, and friends, . We are writing to inform you about some difficult and deeply troubling information. On June 30, 2014, a Marlborough graduate posted an online essay detailing her account of a former teacher's inappropriate communications and behavior, which occurred during the 2011-2012 school year. The School, consistent with its long-standing policies and protocols, promptly investigated and responded to the student's concerns. The essay, however, added details not previously reported to the School. We sincerely regret the suffering our alumna expressed through her essay. Last week, another graduate came forward alleging an inappropriate physical relationship with the same teacher more than a decade ago. In response to this shocking and heart-breaking report, we immediately notified both the Los Angeles Police Department and Child Protective Services. At Marlborough, we hold ourselves to the highest academic and personal standards, and there is no priority greater than the safety and well being of our students. Our commitment to transparency and a full understanding of what occurred compels us to seek the truth. To that end, the Board of Trustees on Friday authorized an independent investigation of this matter and appointed a special investigative committee. This committee will be chaired by Trustee Debra Wong Yang, a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, and a nationally recognized expert in the field of internal investigations. Under Ms. Wong Yang's leadership, the committee will appoint a neutral investigator. If you have any information that may be helpful to the investigation, or if your daughters are aware of any inappropriate conduct, we encourage you to contact us. We will maintain confidentiality to the extent legally permissible. Please contact Head of School Barbara Wagner at [redacted], or Trustee Debra Wong Yang at [redacted]. Marlborough is committed to keeping you fully informed of developments and the steps the School is taking to address this matter. As it becomes available, additional information will be provided on Marlborough's website. You also should know that we anticipate the media will report on this matter in the coming days. We want to thank you in advance for your support. As a community, we can and will work through this challenging period with decisiveness, dignity, and a determination to never let this happen again. Sincerely, . Christine C. Ewell, President, Board of Trustees . Barbara E.

Though Edward had never met Lacroix before, he wasn't alarmed to see the strange man in the compound when he came home Wednesday evening. 'He looked normal enough and he mentioned he knew my dad,' Edward told police. He also called the unexpected guest 'interesting'. Dynasty: Ted Kennedy Jr is the nephew of assassinated President John F Kennedy . Police explained that since the home is shared by the large family, many visitors are often invited to the estate, so Edward was not alarmed when he saw someone he did not know. So unfazed was the 16-year-old, that . he even shared a tortellini dinner with the stranger, and Lacroix politely washed . the dishes after their meal. Edward then took a shower and went out to meet friends, leaving Lacroix in the home alone. Around 9:30pm, Kennedy Jr called the house to check up on his son but Lacroix answered instead, giving his full name. That's . when the elder Kennedy called police to report the intruder. He also . called his son to say that Lacroix was never invited into the home and . that he should stay away from the compound until his mother arrived from . Boston. Police found Lacroix peacefully reading a book in the home and said he appeared to be 'detached from reality' '(Police) asked him what he was doing at the house he said he . was looking for Katy Perry and JFK, and looking to give Katy a gift,' said Barnstable police Sgt. Michael Riley. 'It was pretty clear he was . detached from reality.' He also claimed he was a war veteran and disabled. Neighbors . in the small village community told police they saw the man pull into . the driveway in a black Corvette about three hours earlier. Estate: The compound has been in the Kennedy family for almost 90 years and includes three large homes. Above, an Honor Guard carries the casket of the late Ted Kennedy across the porch of his home on the compound in 2009 . It is believed he may have got inside through an unlocked door. He was arrested on suspicion of breaking and entering by the Barnstable Police and reportedly asked to speak with the Kennedy's themselves according to the news channel WDHD. At the time, Lacroix was out on bail from Flamouth District Court for violating a restraining order against his ex-wife. In court on Wednesday, a court psychologist told the judge that Lacroix appeared to be having delusions and told her he had been treated for a psychotic disorder. His attorney, penelope Psomos, said Lacroix did not make any threats on the Kennedy home The judge agreed that he did not appear dangerous but ordered him to stay away from the compound. Arrest: Police say Lacroix (pictured) broke into the Kennedy family compound wearing a Captain America T-shirt and told officers he was looking for Katy Perry and JFK . Unusual request: Officers said the man asked after the pop sensation, seen performing last week in New York . The compound on Cape Cod has been in the Kennedy family for almost 90 years and includes three large homes on six acres of land. John F Kennedy's father, Joseph P Kennedy, bought a summer cottage near the plot in 1928. The home at which the intruder was found, in Irving Avenue, was bought in 1956. it was assessed this year at $2.11million, according to town records. It was used as a base for John F Kennedy's 1960 Presidential campaign and later as a retreat, where he enjoyed spending time with his family until he was assassinated in 1963. It is now owned by a family trust . It was also a favored home of Ted Jr's father, Senator Ted Kennedy, before his death in 2009. Healthcare lawyer Ted Jr revealed in April that he had finally given into pressure to join the family firm and would make a bid for political office in the Connecticut state senate.

"By . Ashley Collman . Abuse of power: Los Angeles English teacher Joe Koetters (pictured in the above yearbook photo from Marlborough School) has been accused of starting several inappropriate relationships with female students . Pictured for the first time is the teacher at the center of a Los Angeles private school sex scandal, in yearbook photos exclusively obtained by MailOnline. The Polytechnic School issued a statement on Sunday, saying English teacher Joe Koetters, 46, is no longer employed there following fresh allegations he sexually harassed multiple female students. Koetters came under fire last month when former student Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie (now a rising sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania) published an essay on xoJane about the inappropriate relationship he instigated three years ago. That personal account triggered several more former students to come forward and tell Buzzfeed their own experiences with Koetters, which ranged from sexual comments to sexually-charged emails and even touching. Koetters taught English at the $35,000-a-year Marlborough School for 14 years, before leaving last year to teach at his alma-mater Polytechnic School. Amid the new allegations, Koetters has quit his job and now both schools are re-investigating the claims of sexual harassment. Gilbert-Lurie says Koetters crossed the student-teacher boundary when she was a 16-year-old junior, and asked to interview him for the school newspaper. He agreed, replying 'It's a date' to her email. When they met up later outside the school, she wrote that he dodged her questions and turned the conversation towards romantic poetry, saying he could lend her a favorite book of his. At the end of the conversation, his hands brushed against her knee. While Gilbert-Lurie said the flirting made her feel good at first, she became less comfortable with their relationship when he started getting more explicit in their email conversations. Allegations: Several former students are now accusing Koetters of making inappropriate comments, sending sexually-charged emails and even going so far as to touch them . He said he knew how to draw a boundary with other students but not with her and talked about how her short uniform skirt made her 'so alluring'. So a few day later, Gilbert-Lurie wrote him saying they needed to stop so she could focus on finals and 'just being 16'. Koetters responded 'Ugh, Ok,' but continued to harass her in class and through email. That's when she decided to tell her parents. When Gilbert-Lurie and her parents went to the school to inform them about Koetters inappropriate behavior, the administration began an investigation. Koetters was sent to sexual harassment training and stripped of his position as chair of the English department, but was not fired because it was a 'first-time offense'. But Buzzfeed discovered at least two complaints formally lodged against Koetters, not to mention all of the former students who contacted Gilbert-Lurie with similar stories after she published her essay . In 2005, a student lodged a complaint against Koetters but the administration found that the claims were unsubstantiated. Koetters received a second complaint in 2012, from a 2011 grad who accused him of bullying her about her writing. After publishing her essay, Gilbert-Lurie was contacted by several other former Marlborough students who had a similar relationship with Koetters but were too afraid to report his behavior to the administration. Most of these former students agreed to talk to Buzzfeed about their encounters with Koetters. One former student, identified as Mariah, says Koetters once told her: 'I love you in ways that are totally inappropriate for a teacher to love a student.' She also recalled the time they were discussing the book Disgrace by J.M. Coetzee, which is about an inappropriate relationship between an English professor and a student. Mariah talked about how she wanted to write an essay on the book, focusing on predators and prey. Stomping ground: Koetters taught at $35,000-a-year Marlborough School for 14 years. Several former students are now coming out to say that he sexually harassed them . Out of the job: Koetters left Marlborough School in 2013 to start teaching at Polytechnic School, his alma mater. In a statement issued Sunday, the school says he is no longer employed . That's when Koetters told her, 'Just because someone is in a position of power over someone else doesn't mean the relationship can't be mutual.' Crossing the line: University of Pennsylvania student Mikaela Gilbert-Lurie has written an essay detailing the inappropriate relationship her high school teacher Joe Koetters instigated . 'He told me that if we had sex, it could be mutual, it could me love,' Mariah recalls. She says he then put his hand on her knee. Another 2012 graduate recalled how Koetters would use his power over female students to turn friends against each other. A former student identified as Stephanie says he turned their innocent conversations about help with class into a venting session where he would complain about his wife and kids. Stephanie says she felt like an adult when he talked to her about his problems, but knows how wrong it was in retrospect. 'Now that I'm close to my thirties, I realize how wrong the situation was and regret not speaking out,' she said. Koetters left Marlborough in 2013 to teach at another elite institution, Polytechnic School. Marlborough has released a statement saying they are re-investigating Koetters, but were not informed about the other claims from former students. Polytechnic says it did not know about the allegations, but Gilbert-Lurie's mother says she called them before Koetters was hired. On Sunday, Polytechnic issued a statement saying Koetters no longer works there and that they 'considered a range of information and perspectives' during the hiring process. Malborough School officials say they were never informed that Koetters touched Gilbert-Lurie's knee, a claim she refutes. The school has since notified the Los Angeles Police Department Child Protective Students about the allegations, and hired former US Attorney Debra Wong Yang to conduct an investigation. Dear Marlborough parents, alumnae, and friends, . We are writing to inform you about some difficult and deeply troubling information. On June 30, 2014, a Marlborough graduate posted an online essay detailing her account of a former teacher's inappropriate communications and behavior, which occurred during the 2011-2012 school year. The School, consistent with its long-standing policies and protocols, promptly investigated and responded to the student's concerns. The essay, however, added details not previously reported to the School. We sincerely regret the suffering our alumna expressed through her essay. Last week, another graduate came forward alleging an inappropriate physical relationship with the same teacher more than a decade ago. In response to this shocking and heart-breaking report, we immediately notified both the Los Angeles Police Department and Child Protective Services. At Marlborough, we hold ourselves to the highest academic and personal standards, and there is no priority greater than the safety and well being of our students. Our commitment to transparency and a full understanding of what occurred compels us to seek the truth. To that end, the Board of Trustees on Friday authorized an independent investigation of this matter and appointed a special investigative committee. This committee will be chaired by Trustee Debra Wong Yang, a partner at the Los Angeles law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, and a nationally recognized expert in the field of internal investigations. Under Ms. Wong Yang's leadership, the committee will appoint a neutral investigator. If you have any information that may be helpful to the investigation, or if your daughters are aware of any inappropriate conduct, we encourage you to contact us. We will maintain confidentiality to the extent legally permissible. Please contact Head of School Barbara Wagner at [redacted], or Trustee Debra Wong Yang at [redacted]. Marlborough is committed to keeping you fully informed of developments and the steps the School is taking to address this matter. As it becomes available, additional information will be provided on Marlborough's website. You also should know that we anticipate the media will report on this matter in the coming days. We want to thank you in advance for your support. As a community, we can and will work through this challenging period with decisiveness, dignity, and a determination to never let this happen again. Sincerely, . Christine C. Ewell, President, Board of Trustees . Barbara E.

"By . Pa Reporter . As the 2014 World Cup continues, Sportsmail will be providing you with all you need to know about every fixture in Brazil from team news and key battles to betting odds and Opta stats... next up, it's Chile vs Australia in Group B . Click here to follow the Chile vs Australia World Cup 2014 action live . Group B: Chile vs Australia . Venue: Arena Pantenal, CuiabaKick-off: 11pm (6pm, Brazil time)TV coverage: ITV1, from 10.35pmOdds: Chile 2/5, Draw 16/5, Australia 8/1Referee: Noumandiez Doue, Ivory Coast . The venue: The Arena Pantanal in Cuiaba will host the Group B match between Chile and Australia on Friday night . Managers: . Jorge Sampaoli (Chile)Ange Postecoglou (Australia) Team news: Chile are hoping star midfielder Arturo Vidal is fit and able to play when they square off against Australia in Cuiaba on Friday. The Juventus player has been struggling with inflammation in his right knee following an operation on his meniscus last month and has had a big question mark over his availability for the World Cup Group B games ever since. Vidal, a free-kick specialist, has trained with the team since Wednesday and featured for 15 minutes in a 2-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland last week. Injury doubt: Chile's Arturo Vidal could miss the match with Australia with a knee problem . 'Arturo trained like the rest of us,' Chile midfielder Gary Medel said. 'He did a good job and didn't have any pain in his knee. 'We hope that he can be with us for the first game. It will depend on him and how he feels. We want him to take care of himself and if he does play, we hope it (meniscus) doesn't affect him.' Experienced striker Tim Cahill will lead the Socceroos' attack while veteran midfielder Mark Bresciano is doubtful with a back injury. The biggest challenge for Australia, who are competing in their third straight World Cup finals, is the lack of experience for many of their players. Leading the way: Veteran striker Tim Cahill will be up front for Australia . A total of seven players in the squad are currently on the books of A-League clubs. 'For a lot of these players it's their first go at the big stage and I'm sure there's a little bit of uncertainty in their heads,' Postecoglou said. 'If we can get through those initial moments we'll be fine.' Crystal Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak will captain Australia. Key clash: Alexis Sanchez v Jason Davidson . Sanchez successfully emerged from Lionel Messi’s shadow at Barcelona this season and the lightning-quick forward will be looking to lead Chile in Brazil. He is more than capable of exploiting the gaps left by Davidson on Australia’s left-hand side, with the full-back known more for his attacking than defensive play. Danger man: Alexis Sanchez will be one of Chile's main creative influences . Tough ask: Australia's Jason Davidson has the task of keeping an eye on Alexis Sanchez in the match . One to watch: Marcelo Diaz (Chile) English teams have tended to wilt against Basel in recent years and Diaz is one of the main reasons why. Comparisons with Xavi are slightly far-fetched, but the composed midfielder performs a similar role making his teams tick at both club and international level. Head-to-head record: Played 4 Chile Wins 3 Draws 1 . Opta stats:•  Australia’s first ever point in a World Cup group came courtesy of a 0-0 draw against Chile in June 1974; it remains their only clean sheet in 10 World Cup Finals matches. •  Since their third place finish in 1962, Chile have only won two of their 17 World Cup games (D6 L9). •  Chile have lost against a subsequent finalist in each of their last three World Cups (West Germany in 1982, Brazil in 1998 and Spain in 2010). •  The Socceroos have only won two of their 10 games at the World Cup (D3 L5) – these coming against Japan in 2006 (3-1) and Serbia in 2010 (2-1). • Australia’s last eight World Cup games have produced seven red cards (four for the Socceroos, three for their opponents). • Chile conceded 1.56 goals per game in the qualifiers, more than any other of the 32 participants in the 2014 edition. •  Australia have never beaten la Roja in any competition, drawing one and losing three so far. •  Arturo Vidal was the top scoring midfielder in South American qualifying, helping himself to five goals.","Two weaker sides in Group B clash in Cuiaba after Spain play Holland .

"By . Jill Reilly . and Ashley Collman . Killed: Convicted rapist and murderer Eddie Wayne Davis, 45, was put to death today. His last meal was chop steak with onions and gravy, home fries, Brussels sprouts, corn, cherry ice cream and Dr Pepper . A man who raped and killed an 11-year-old girl was executed today with the victim's grandmother watching from the witness chamber on behalf of her deceased mother. Eddie Wayne Davis, 45, declined to say any last words before receiving a three-drug injection at 6:30pm at Florida State Prison. He was convicted in 1995 on a charge of first-degree murder in the death of Kimberly Waters, whose mother briefly dated Davis. For his last meal, Davis ate chop steak with onions and gravy, home fries, Brussels sprouts, corn, cherry ice cream and Dr Pepper. After receiving the initial injection, Davis began muttering to himself though those in the viewing area couldn't hear what he said since the intercom speakers were turned off. His chest then heaved up and down for about five minutes before he became motionless. He did not appear to be in any signs of pain and was pronounced dead at 6:43pm. Davis' mother and a spiritual adviser were the last to visit him today. It was the sixth execution in Florida this year and the second in the state since the death penalty came under fresh scrutiny in April. In late April, Oklahoma prison officials halted the execution of inmate Clayton Lockett after noting that the lethal injection drugs weren't being administered into his vein properly. The procedure was stopped but he died of a heart attack several minutes later. In Florida, three members of Kimberly's family say they plan to witness Davis' final moments. Mary Hobbs, Kimberly's grandmother, said her daughter - Kimberly's mother - was killed in a motorcycle crash. Hobbs said she feels a special duty this week in seeing Davis put to death. 'I need to be there to represent my daughter and my granddaughter,' she said. 'My daughter never lived to see this happen and that just breaks my heart.' Kimberly's mother, Beverly Schultz, had broken up with Davis after learning about his criminal history, Hobbs said. Davis had served prison sentences for a string of burglaries. They broke up six months before Kimberly's slaying. Davis told police he broke into a home in the central Florida community of Lakeland on March 3, 1994, looking for beer money and said he didn't think anyone was home. According to court documents and detectives, Davis found Kimberly sleeping in her mother's bed while her mother was working a double shift at a nursing home. He gagged her so she wouldn't wake up her 13-year-old sister in another room. Prosecutors said Davis took the 11-year-old girl to a trailer, raped her and later beat her. Kimberly fought back as Davis suffocated her by pressing plastic over her face. It would be the sixth execution in Florida this year and the second in the state since the death penalty came under fresh scrutiny in April . His DNA was found under her fingernails. When she stopped breathing, he threw her body in a commercial trash bin. 'I feel he was striking back at (my daughter),' Hobbs told The Associated Press recently. 'But it was senseless.' In 1995, he was convicted by a jury in Polk County, a central Florida county in between Tampa and Orlando. Florida uses three drugs - midazolam hydrochloride, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride - for executions. The drugs are administered intravenously, intended to induce unconsciousness, paralysis and cardiac arrest. Midazolam, a sedative routinely used in surgery, has been part of the three-drug mixture since 2013. Previously, sodium thiopental was used, but its U.S. manufacturer stopped making it and Europe has banned its manufacturers from exporting it for executions. Other states use the same three drugs, and they were administered in the April execution in Oklahoma. Davis made a last-ditch effort to appeal his death sentence, maintaining that he suffers from a rare medical condition that would cause him extreme abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting after the first drug is injected. His lawyers said that the pain would violate the constitutional prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. On Monday, the Florida Supreme Court rejected his argument. Hobbs said she wants the world to know that Kimberly's family still cares about her and still remembers her life - Kimberly loved being in nature, butterflies and wildflowers. 'After 20 years, it still hurts,' said Hobbs. 'It makes you wonder, what would she have become?' Florida's last execution happened on June 18. John Ruthell Henry, who was convicted of killing his estranged wife and her son, was put to death; he was among three people who were executed in the U.S. during a 24-hour span in June.","Death row inmate Eddie Wayne Davis, 45, was executed Thursday at 6:30pm .

"By . Associated Press . Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling responded to the NBA's attempt to oust him on Tuesday, arguing that there is no basis for stripping him of his team because his racist statements were illegally recorded 'during an inflamed lovers' quarrel in which he was clearly distraught.' According to the response, a copy of which was obtained by The Associated Press, Sterling says V. Stiviano recorded him without his knowledge and thus the recording was illegal under California law. He also said he could not have 'willfully' damaged the league because he did not know it would be made public. 'A jealous rant to a lover never intended to be published cannot offend the NBA rules,' Sterling said in the document, which was first reported by USA Today. Fighting: Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, pictured, responded to the NBA's attempt to oust him on Tuesday and said there is no basis to stripping him of his team because his racist statements were illegally recorded 'during an inflamed lovers' quarrel' Meanwhile, . the attorney for Shelly Sterling confirmed that Donald Sterling has . given her written permission to sell the team. According to a person who . is in contact with a potential bidder, who spoke to the AP on the . condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the . process publicly, the Clippers are seeking binding bids before next . Tuesday - the day NBA owners are scheduled to meet in New York and vote . on whether to strip Sterling of the team. The . league said in a statement Tuesday that if three-quarters of the 30 . owners voted to sustain the charge, 'the Sterlings' interests in the . Clippers will be terminated and the team will be sold.' The . NBA charged Donald Sterling with damaging the league and its . merchandising partners, and the league's constitution gave him until the . end of Tuesday to respond. According to a basketball official familiar . with the proceedings, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was . not authorized to discuss Sterling, the NBA has scheduled a call of its . executive committee for Wednesday afternoon. Shelly . Sterling submitted her own separate response to the NBA's charges . Tuesday that included a 'vigorous defense of the attempt by the NBA to . blame her,' according to a person with knowledge of the proceedings. The . individual wasn't authorized to speak publicly about the response. Illegal? Sterling claims that his remarks were private and not meant to 'take a position' that damaged the NBA . Mistress: V.Stiviano, pictured, recorded Sterling's remarks during an argument . In . his response, Donald Sterling says that next week's hearing cannot be . fair because the owners have already made up their minds, quoting 10 . teams who commented on Twitter or elsewhere that they supported the . seizure of the team. An AP survey on the day Commissioner Adam Silver . announced Sterling's lifetime ban found that half of the teams supported . it and no owner was against it. 'These . proceedings will be a spectacle meant to mollify the popular opinion, . not a fair and impartial hearing: the outcome of these proceedings . became a foregone conclusion weeks ago,' the response states. The . response also notes the disparity between his lifetime ban and $2.5 . million fine and previous NBA punishments, including the $100,000 fine . levied on Kobe Bryant when he was caught referring to a referee by a . homosexual slur, and the 72-game suspension of Ron Artest for punching a . fan. The NBA said Sterling . is in violation because his racist comments were harmful to the league . and its business partners, including the players. Sterling's response . argues that because his comments came in the privacy of his girlfriend's . living room he cannot be considered 'taking a position' that damaged . the NBA, as required under the league constitution. Trying to sell? Shelly Sterling, pictured, is reportedly trying to sell the Los Angeles Clippers before next Tuesday . 'Mr. Sterling was not `conducting' the `sport of professional basketball' when he was arguing with Ms. Stiviano in her living room,' the response . says. 'Not even the Commissioner alleges that Mr. Sterling intended to . harm the NBA with his comment. Nor could he. This was an argument . between a jealous man and the woman he loved that should never have left . the privacy of his living room.' Sterling . also noted his history of supporting racial diversity, including five . black head coaches and a black general manager, Elgin Baylor, who held . the job for 22 years.

'Home Is Where The Heart Is... My Home,My City,My House..#HeatLifer,' Wade posted on Instagram in a social media teaser before the Heat finally made it official.

'He has shown his commitment to the Heat many times over the course of his career and has always been willing to sacrifice in order to help build this team into a champion. This time is no different. 'I am ecstatic to have him back in the fold and I am confident that Dwyane, as always, will be leading this team as we look to contend for NBA championships.' While details of the multi-year deal were not made public, the All-Star guard will make at least $15 million per season, ESPN reported. The development was not unexpected as Miami's front office strives to reconstruct a team that made four successive trips to the NBA Finals and won two titles before James's decision to return to the Cleveland Cavaliers following four seasons with the Heat. Wade was part of the so-called 'Big Three' with James and forward Chris Bosh, who also has re-signed a massive deal to stay in Miami. The Heat have also added free agent forward Luol Deng as part of their rebuilding since James's departure.

Wade still managed to average 19 points, 4.7 assists and 4.5 rebounds in the 2013-14 campaign. The Heat went on to win the Eastern Conference title before falling decisively in five games to the San Antonio Spurs in the championship series. Wade had invoked an early termination option after four years of a six-year deal worth $108 million, opting for free agency to free up money for the team as it sought to improve the roster and keep James.","Wade posts on Instagram: 'Home Is Where The Heart Is...

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Lewis Hamilton heads into Formula One's summer break with a smile on his face after believing he has proven himself in times of adversity. Hamilton could have been cut severely adrift of Mercedes team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg in the championship standings following disastrous qualifying sessions in the last two races. But from 20th on the grid in the German Grand Prix following a brake disc failure, and a pit-lane start in Hungary on Sunday in the wake of a fire sparked by a fuel leak, Hamilton battled through to third on both occasions. Time for a toast: Lewis Hamilton did well to find himself on the podium in the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday . Close: Hamilton fought off Mercedes and championship rival Nico Rosberg to secure third place . With eight races of the campaign remaining come F1's resumption in Belgium in three weeks' time, Hamilton's deficit to Rosberg is only 11 points. Hamilton has used the phrase 'damage limitation' all too often this season, but is able to head away on holiday relieved to still be in the hunt for motor sport's prized crown. 'We've had some difficult weekends throughout this season, but if I'm honest, looking back at it now, I wouldn't want it any other way,' said Hamilton on the team's official website. 'Sometimes it's nice to have things easy, but I love a challenge and I love a fight. It's not the times of ease that show who you are - it's the times of adversity. 'I definitely feel like the tough breaks I've had this year have made me stronger, and hopefully I've shown I've got heart. 'To have taken two podiums from two difficult weekends before the break has been really satisfying. 'More than that, it allows me to smile and enjoy this time off knowing I still have an opportunity to fight for this championship.' Hamilton has revealed his holiday time will combine lazing on a beach with working out at the gym, the latter to put on extra muscle lost earlier this season to accommodate the new weight regulations. The recent removal from all cars of a particular suspension system will allow Hamilton 'to bulk up a bit'. Beyond that, it will then be full-attack mode from Hamilton for the final eight races in which he will be hoping for more luck when it comes to reliability. Fight until the end: Rosbeg currently leads by 11 points with eight fascinating races remaining . Spinning off: Hamilton seems to be at ease with his car once again after some questionable recent laps . 'I'm happy with our performance so far this year in terms of the pace we have in the car,' added Hamilton. 'The team have done a great job with that. We just need to work on the reliability, and I know that's the priority for everyone back at the factories. 'I have to say, though, over the last two weekends in Germany and Hungary in particular, the guys have been amazing. 'It's tough for everyone involved when reliability comes into play. 'To see these issues happen after all the long hours and hard work they've put in, I know it hurts them as much as it hurts me. 'To then fight through, get the car back together, get me out there and not give up or lose hope, I can't thank them enough for everything they do and that's what's going to keep me going right through this year. 'There's still a long, long way to go and I know both the guys and myself will keep pushing right to the chequered flag in Abu Dhabi. 'We'll be back stronger than ever in Spa.' Talking it over: Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo came out victorious in the final GP before the mid-season break . Meanwhile, Felipe Massa is convinced Williams can push Mercedes all the way when Formula One returns from its summer break. Williams have been a revelation this year, scoring almost as many points in the first 11 races as they have managed in the previous . four years following the introduction of the new scoring system. Unfortunately for Massa, in his first year with the team after many seasons of service with Ferrari, the Brazilian has been plagued by bad luck . and involved in a number of incidents. It means Massa has scored only 40 of Williams' 135 points in total, compared to the 95 for team-mate Valtteri Bottas. But the 33-year-old has no doubt he and Williams can deliver over the final eight races, in particular in the opening two in Belgium and Italy where the power circuits of Spa and Monza should play to the car's strengths. Keeping cool: Felipe Massa believes Williams can compete with Mercedes when Formula One returns . 'I'm sure we can have a very good second half of the season looking at the behaviour of the car until now,' said Massa. 'Spa and Monza should suit us, maybe Austin and Brazil, and in the last race in Abu Dhabi there are some good straights. 'The car can be competitive at many tracks, not just Spa and Monza, but maybe at those two we can be stronger than the others. 'It won't be easy, but it's not impossible that at these tracks we will have more of a chance against Mercedes.'","Lewis Hamilton just 11 points behind Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg .

"By . Sam Peters . President Barack Obama will host a concussion conference in the United States on Thursday as concerns about head injuries in sport reaches the world’s highest political office. He is expected to unveil new commitments by the public and private sectors aimed at raising awareness of the dangers of concussion following a $765million agreement by the NFL to compensate players suffering from early-onset dementia linked to multiple head injuries. Breakthrough: Rugby authorities set to announce sweeping new measures to improve player welfare . ‘This is something that I think a lot of families spend a lot of time worrying about and want to know as much as they can about, and want to be sure that they’re taking all the precautions they can on behalf of their children,’ a White House spokesman said. Accepted there could be a link between multiple concussions and the early onset of dementia. Agreed to fund a long-term research into the issue . Agreed to introduce widespread concussion education across the professional game . Agreed to look again at the controversial Pitch Side Concussion Assessment . Agreed to tighten up return to play protocols to ensure players receive adequate rest after suffering concussion . Accepted rugby has far more to do to ensure players across the game understand the risks of playing on with concussion . Athletes, coaches, parents, medical experts, administrators and campaigners will attend the White House Healthy Kids and Safe Sports Concussion Summit, aimed at helping to identify, treat and prevent concussions and promote research into injuries in order to better address the problems. ‘The conference is an important development in the debate about concussion in sport,’ said former NFL star and campaigner Chris Nowinski. ‘If the President of the United States is prepared to look at this issue then it suggests it is being taken pretty seriously. I believe the US is leading the way on this subject and other countries, including the UK, will inevitably follow.’ A cross-party paper into concussion in sport will be published in Parliament next month following months of campaigning by the Mail on Sunday. The International Rugby Board and Rugby Football Union have introduced a raft of new measures to improve player welfare in recent months but the Football Association have yet to introduce any clear protocols despite a promise to do so in March.

"By . Chris Pleasance . Hugging a giant block of ice may seem a bizarre way to bring good fortune to your new year, but at least these men from Japan can console themselves with the thought that it can't get much worse. In in Tokyo yesterday around 100 people took part in the ancient Shinto festival of Kanchu Misogi, a winter purification ritual that is supposed to cleanse the body and soul and bring them closer to mystical spirits which they believe can bring them success. In temperatures of just 40F (6C) these men stripped down to loincloths and headbands before taking a dip in the freezing water of the pool at Teppozu Inari Shinto shrine while crouching down in order to pray. Scroll down for video . Ice to meet to: Despite holding a giant block of ice in a freeing cold pool, this Shinto worshipper manages to crack a smile for the cameras . In temperatures of just 40F (6C) these men climbed into a pool of freezing water at the Teppozu Inari Shinto shrine in central Tokyo in order to pray . The ritual is supposed to purify the followers in order to bring them closer to kame - spirits or powers - which they believe will bring them good fortune . Happy New Year: Kanchu Misogi is a traditional new year festival in Japan for followers of Shinto which is supposed to purify body and soul and bring good fortune . The ritual is celebrated across Japan and usually involved participants washing themselves with cold water, but can also involve being covered in snow. Shinto is less of a religion and more of a way of life, and followers perform many rituals designed to please kame - meaning spirits or powers. This particular shrine is dedicated to Inari, one of the most important kame who brings success, prosperity and fertility. Despite their obvious suffering in these pictures, followers of Shinto believe that the spirits want humans to be happy and are willing to help them if they are treated correctly. Around 100 followers took part in the ceremony which is celebrated all over Japan, but usually just involves washing in cold water . The temple seen here is dedicated to Inari, one of the main kame of Shinto, who can bring people prosperity, success and fertility . Shinto is more of a way of life, rather than a religion, as it has no commandments, no God, no founder and allows people to follow other beliefs . Desite this man's suffering, Shiinto teaches that humans are essentially good and that the spirits that watch over them love them and want them to succeed . Shinto has no God or Gods, no founder, no central commandments and allows people to follow other religions. Instead it teaches ethical principles and a love of oneself. Shinto, which translates as 'way of the spirits', is intricately linked with the geography of Japan, and so is rarely practiced outside of the country. Purity is at the heart of Shinto's understanding of good and evil. Pollution - tsumi - can be physical, moral or spiritual. Being pure is incredibly important to believers of Shinto, though their equivalent of sin - tsumi - is usually caused by things outside of people's control, rather than people themselves . Shinto means 'way of the spirits' and is seldom worshipped outside of Japan because of its very strong link with the Japanese landscape . Other purity rituals in Shinto can involve going long periods without sleep, breathing exercises, standing under waterfalls and other balance training . The ritual also helps to keep the participants physically fit and tests their endurance . Tsumi means much the same as the English word 'sin', but it differs from sin in that it includes things which are beyond the control of individual human beings and are thought of as being caused by evil spirits. In ancient Shinto, tsumi also included disease, disaster and error. Anything connected with death or the dead is considered particularly polluting.","Around 100 followers of Shinto gathered at this shrine in central Tokyo in order to take part in this ceremony .

A Chicago woman who claimed she was looking for a cash machine, ended up driving onto train tracks because she was more than two times over the legal limit for alcohol when she was caught. Maria Segura, 26, faces two counts of DUI and was cited for driving with a suspended license, driving in the wrong lane, and driving without insurance. The incident took place in the western suburbs of the Windy city early on Monday morning. On the wrong side of the tracks: Maria E.

Riverside police Chief Tom Wietzel called the incident 'mindboggling.' Just after 4 a.m. Monday, a Riverside police officer saw Ms. Segura's vehicle stopped at a railroad with its turn signal on. The car then made a sharp turn striking both rails, according to a police statement. The officer called 911 to have the railroad stop any train traffic in the area and pulled the car over on the tracks. Off the rails: Maria Segura¿s Chevrolet Cavalier on the tracks. Police had all train traffic running along the railroad halted whilst they dealt with the incident . The report said the officer 'could detect a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage coming from the mouth' of the driver, while her eyes were bloodshot and she had a difficult time communicating.' Segura told police she was 'was attempting to drive to an ATM to retrieve money and that is why she was on the railroad tracks.' Police said her blood-alcohol level was 2.5 times the legal limit might explain why she ended up stuck on the tracks around 4 a.m. They also noted that her driver’s license was suspended, and confiscated her 1996 Chevy Cavalier. 'The fact that this driver was so intoxicated that she would drive directly on railroad tracks believing that she was still on a roadway is simply mindboggling and shows the extent of her excessive alcohol consumption,' Weitzel said in the statement. 'The drunk driving situation … has just become simply out of control. … This needs to be addressed as a social issue and not just a law enforcement concern because motorists continue to drive drunk every single day and it is at epidemic levels on weekends.'","Maria Segura, 26, told police she was looking for a cash machine - at 4 a.m.

The National Weather Service . warned that the destructive storms were expected to continue Monday in . the South and Mississippi Valley. Wrecked: John Ward, an automobile and RV dealer, looks at tornado damage to one of his trucks in Mayflower, Arkansas. At least 16 people died Sunday night in Arkansas as a tornado carved an 80-mile path of destruction . The National Weather Service in North Little Rock said it was virtually certain that the storm that hit Vilonia and nearby Mayflower would be rated as the nation's strongest twister to date this year. Another twister killed a person in Quapaw, Oklahoma, before crossing into Kansas to the north and destroying 60 to 70 homes and injuring 25 people in the city of Baxter Springs, according to authorities in Kansas. The overall death toll stood at 17 early Monday. Among the ruins in Vilonia was a new $14million intermediate school that had been set to open this fall. 'There's just really nothing there anymore. We're probably going to have to start all over again,' Vilonia Schools Superintendent Frank Mitchell said after surveying what was left of the building. Debris: Travel trailers and motor homes are piled on top of each other at Mayflower RV in Mayflower, Arkansas. A powerful storm system rumbled through the central and southern United States on Sunday, spawning tornadoes . The Arkansas twister shredded cars, trucks and 18-wheelers stuck along Interstate 40 north of Little Rock. After the storm passed, tractor-trailer rigs tried to navigate through the damage as gawkers captured cellphone photos of the destruction. State troopers went vehicle-to-vehicle to check on motorists and found — with genuine surprise — that no one was killed. 'About 30 vehicles — large trucks, sedans, pickup trucks — were going through there when the funnel cloud passed over,' said Bill Sadler, a spokesman for the Arkansas State Police. The country had enjoyed a relative lull in violent weather and didn't record the first tornado death until Sunday, when a North Carolina infant who was injured by a twister Friday died at a hospital. But the system that moved through the Plains, Midwest and South on Sunday produced tornadoes that struck several states, including also Missouri, Nebraska and Iowa.

"By . David Mccormack . and James Gordon . A new powdered alcohol product announced just days ago has had its approval promptly reversed following a barrage of negative publicity surrounding fears that it could encourage irresponsible - and even underage - drinking. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau approved Palcohol's powdered vodka, rum, and other cocktails ‘in error,’ Tom Hogue, the agency's director of congressional and public affairs, told The Associated Press via email. The agency did not responded to further questions. The company behind Palcohol, Tempe, Arizona-based Lipsmark, said that ‘there seemed to be a discrepancy [about] how much powder’ is in the packets, which are meant to be mixed with water. Prior to having its approval withdrawn on Monday, Palcohol had previously announced six varieties of powdered alcohol including vodka and rum . According to the website for the Alcohol . and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, multiple varieties of Palcohol . received ‘label approval’ on April 8. Palcohol had previously announced six . varieties of powdered alcohol, including vodka, rum and four cocktails - . Cosmopolitan, Mojito, Powderita and Lemon Drop. The company agreed to surrender its approvals on Monday and has said that it will resubmit the product for approval by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. No . sooner had Palcohol announced its initial products . than critics where questioning the potential dangers of a powered form . of alcohol which could fit into a pocket, making it more portable . than a bottle or flask of liquor.

The company agreed to surrender its approvals on Monday but has said that it will resubmit Palcohol for approval . Vodka and eggs? As well as adding the alcoholic power to water, the site also suggested that Palcohol could be poured over food . The . company initially did little to discourage these fears as the Palcohol website featured a lot of information on how the product could be used to consume alcohol in unusual ways and little about promoting . ‘responsible drinking’. 'Maybe . you’re a college football fan. So many stadiums don’t even serve . alcohol. What’s that about; watching football without drinking?! That’s . almost criminal. Bring Palcohol in and enjoy the game,' stated the . website. As well as adding the alcoholic power to water, the site also suggested that Palcohol could be poured over food. 'Sprinkle . Palcohol on almost any dish and give it an extra kick. Some of our . favorites are the Kamikaze in guacamole, Rum on a BBQ sandwich, Cosmo on . a salad and Vodka on eggs in the morning to start your day off right.' There . were even some rudimentary cooking instructions: 'Remember, you have to . add Palcohol AFTER a dish is cooked as the alcohol will burn off if you . cook with it... and that defeats the whole purpose.' The . company also appeared to be encouraging users to try snorting their product: 'You’ll get drunk almost instantly . because the alcohol will be absorbed so quickly in your nose.' Those . posts were quickly taken down and the company claims it was simply . experimenting with 'edgy marketing' that wasn't meant to be seen by the public. Party on! The company had stated that Palcohol would make it easier to consume alcohol where it is normally banned, such as at ball games . Palcohol had previously announced several cocktail varieties including Lemon Drop and a Powderita . ‘As . Palcohol is a new product, we have yet to understand its potential of . being added to food,’ the website now states, along with warning people . that the powder shouldn't be snorted. According . to the site, the product’s founder Mark Phillips came up with the idea . because he is an ‘active guy’ and wanted a way to enjoy an adult . beverage after long hours hiking, biking or camping without having to . carry around heavy bottles. 'What . we can say now is that we hope the product will be used in a . responsible and legal manner. Being in compliance with all Federal and . State laws is very important to us. Palcohol will only be sold through . establishments that are licensed to sell liquor.' Powdered . alcohol is not a new concept. Such products are already being sold in . other countries including Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands. According to some, alcohol laws would in general only apply to liquids.

"By . Steph Cockroft . They've long been known as the most cunning animal around - and it seems this urban fox is happily living up to its reputation. A fox with a foot fetish from Horsforth, West Yorkshire has been swiping pairs of shoes from unsuspecting residents - and dropping them off as gifts to a neighbour's garden. Elaine Hewitt and her husband William keep waking up to different pairs of shoes - including designer trainers, work boots and even smart leather shoes - which have been dropped off overnight by the animal. Elaine Hewitt, 40, from Horsforth, West Yorkshire, pictured with . her daughter Felicity, set up a stall to return shoes to her neighbours because an urban fox keeps delivering pairs of footwear to the family's garden . It all began when the fox delivered a pair of Y-fronts to the family - and soon the fox had brought them nearly 40 pairs of shoes. The family have now become so inundated with random pairs of shoes that they set up a shoe stall outside their home, in a bid to return the shoes to their rightful owners. The family believe this mother fox is responsible for the shoes deliveries to their home . Mrs Hewitt, 40, said: 'We started putting them in the garage and when we had two full carrier bags, I decided enough was enough. 'Some were quite good quality and new. There were brands like Vans and Firetrap. We got hiking boots and even a man’s workboots.' Mrs Hewitt said the mother fox has stolen around 30 to 40 shoes from her neighbour's doorsteps and porches. She said: 'It started a few months ago when a pair of Y-Fronts appeared on the lawn in the back garden. 'I . looked out the window and saw what I thought was a pair of underpants, . and it was. It was quite alarming really, but then the next day there . was a shoe left in the same place. 'I realised there was an animal bringing them and then on a daily basis we got a shoe delivered.' The shoes - which are never damaged and include expensive brands - are left overnight by a mother fox with a den nearby. Mrs Hewitt said: 'We see the fox around a lot. She has five cubs and it’s no doubt it’s her. There will be a stash of shoes in her den. 'She gets them from people’s houses around here. We see a lot of garden shoes and kids shoes that might have been left outside. 'I think she might bring them back as toys for her cubs. She is very tame and she gets very close to us.' Despite advertising the miscellaneous shoes to their neighbours, Mr and Mrs Hewitt still have a large pile of unclaimed footwear. They also have a pair of baseball gloves and the item of underwear left by the fox. She said: 'We . have had a few pairs but they are mainly odd shoes. A lot of people . have claimed a shoe which is very satisfying after my daughter went . around with some flyers asking if anyone had lost one. 'There’s . a little girl on our avenue and she came to collect a shoe. She was . really happy because it was one of her new red Vans and she thought she . had lost it. Mrs Hewitt said the fox has brought the family up to 40 pairs of shoes from her neigbours' homes to their garden - . which include designer trainers, work boots and even smart leather . shoes . 'Cars pull up all the time to have a look. Someone thought I was having a clear out and that they were my shoes. 'I was mortified in case anyone thought they were my shoes in case they recognised them as their own.' As the drop-offs remain as frequent as ever, Mrs Hewitt believes the fox may only stop being so generous when her cubs have left the den. After finding so many pairs, the family set up the shoe stall to return the footwear to the rightful owners. Although many people have come to claim the shoes, the family still have a large collection leftover . She said: 'The shoes are never damaged so I think it’s something to do with her being a mother. 'She’s just carrying them as if they were a cub so she might stop when they are older. 'You could wear the shoes again except for when they’ve been left outside and got wet. A lot are leather and they’re never chewed. 'It used to be really exciting looking out the window to see if a shoe had been left - just like looking out to see if it’s snowed at Christmas. But now it’s just another shoe. 'It’s strange because we haven’t had any stolen. She just brings other people’s to us.' Urban Wildlife expert John Bryant said: 'A fox family will tend to consider up to 500 homes and garden as its territory and will constantly patrol this area looking for items to take home. 'It used to be really exciting looking . out the window to see if a shoe had been left - just like looking out to . see if it’s snowed at Christmas. But now it’s just another shoe.' Elaine Hewitt . 'As the fox’s den is close to this family’s home, it will consider the garden an extension of its own home and part of its territory. 'Shoes are a particularly common item for foxes, especially trainers. Teenagers’ trainers left outside to air are very easy for them to grab and make off with. 'The fox will take the shoes somewhere they know they won’t be bothered and examine them for anything edible. If they find no use for them they will either give them to their cubs to play with or abandon them - in this case in this family’s garden. 'At this time of year when the cubs are three months old and turning into teenagers, it’s as well not the leave anything out at night.' Some of the family's neighbours have also had mysterious pairs of shoes cropping up in their garden. Chris Seller, 76, who is married to Christine, said: 'We have received several  shoes, left for us by foxes. I’d say we’ve had about three or four, and they’re always old garden shoes. The sit of the garden where the fox leaves shoes for the Hewitt family . 'I can’t remember what I did with the first few but then when I heard about Elaine’s shoe rack, I took one of them down and actually found its matching pair. 'It wasn’t until I spoke to Elaine that I realised we weren’t the only ones and I was amazed to hear how many they’ve been left.' Michael Thompson, another neighbour, 53, said: 'We do see a fox around in the garden, especially at night. 'Not long ago, my son was actually playing with his electric remote-controlled  car in the street outside when the fox actually sat and watched him for a while. 'It’s likely to be the same one as it didn’t seem phased to be around people.' And Dr Trevor Fox and his family regularly receive visits from the urban wildlife. He said: 'The foxes love coming to visit the Fox’s. Just last night we saw the vixen with four of her cubs walking across the garden. 'They’ve never brought us any shoes however, they just seem to like wandering around here. We back on to the Hewitts’ house so it’s easy for them to access. 'It’s becoming quite a talking point around here though, I can’t believe how many people have got to know the foxes, and how much bother they’re causing stealing people’s shoes.'","Elaine Hewitt, 40, has received around 40 pairs of shoes from an urban fox .

The lineups included two border terriers; a wire-haired dachshund; a Jack Russell terrier/Australian cattle dog mix; a Patterdale terrier, an intense, no-nonsense breed that's uncommon in this country; and a feist, a type of dog developed in the American South to tree squirrels. 'Get 'im! Go!' Serge Lozach yells as his cairn terrier, Hudson, streaks down an alley after a fleeing rat.

While dog owners may see it as time-honored pursuit, rat-hunting riles animal-rights advocates . Experts the number of rats in New York could be double that of the Big Apple’s 8.4 million people. Last month New York's 45 inspectors were bolstered by nine new employees of a pilot program to tackle the vermin in chronically infested neighborhoods where rats have resisted repeated efforts to eradicate them. Specific targets are rat reservoirs such as parks, sewers, dumping areas and subways where they congregate and breed. The idea is to tamp down the population where it is strongest and keep it from spreading. 'Rats burrow and live in colonies,' Health Commissioner Mary Bassett told the City Council at a hearing. 'I'll sometimes imagine when I walk through a park, if I could have sort of a 'rat vision,' there are all these tunnels under there that are occupied by rats. And from there the rats fan out.' Financed with $611,000 in the current city budget, inspectors will work with neighborhood associations, community boards, elected officials and building owners to plug up holes and put poison in rodent tunnels. For years, inspectors responding to complaints on the city's 311 hotline have already been searching for rats and their telltale signs: burrows, droppings, claw marks and gnawed holes. Besides traps and poison, the city also has used contraceptives to curb the rats. New York's Rat Information Portal — or, appropriately, RIP — is an interactive online map that tracks Health Department violations, with searches by borough, address, block number and ZIP code. Spots marked red are deemed to be rat-infested; those in yellow have passed inspection. The South Bronx around Yankee Stadium has the dubious distinction of being the city's most rat-infested neighborhood, according to figures from 2012, the most recent available. Inspectors gave a failing grade for infestation to at least 13 percent of more than 3,000 locations inspected in that area. Washington Heights came in at 12 percent of inspected locations, West Harlem at 10 percent and the Lower East Side and adjacent Chinatown at nearly 9 percent. Rats can carry and spread diseases, bite and trigger asthma attacks. In May, a fpur-year-old boy died after ingesting rat poison in a Bronx homeless shelter. It's impossible to tally the exact number of rats in New York, says the Rev. Joel Grassi, a Baptist minister and professional exterminator. 'As long as there are human beings in New York City, there will be rats, because they live off human garbage — that's their No. 1 thing,' says Grassi, adding that the best way to manage the rat population is to eliminate their food supply. Just because your pet runs after backyard squirrels doesn't mean it could ever catch one. When at its best, the alley pack works together - one dog will sniff out a rat and signal its whereabouts, often by barking. Another leaps at the hideaway to rout the quarry, and then a third lurches to catch it as it flees. A rat that scuttles into the open might get caught in a rundown, or even a tug of war, between dogs that circle and flank it. After making a kill with a bite or a shake, the hunters trot back, rat in mouth, and allow their owners to take it from their jaws. The night's kill ends up in a trash bin. The participants say they're less about killing rats than giving dogs the experience of chasing them. The Health Department declined to comment on the hunts. The idea has a long history. A noted 1851 examination of working-class life in London describes rat-catchers working the city's streets with ferrets and terriers. More recently, a rat-catching dachshund got attention in Seattle when its owner happened by while City Councilman Tom Rasmussen was checking out a downtown cleanup program in 2010. Rasmussen snapped a picture of the dog, rat in mouth, and posted the photo on his website. There's even an American dog breed called a rat terrier, though its origins lie on farms. Rat-tracking recently became an official canine sport, called 'barn hunt.' Dogs get two minutes to sniff around a hay-bale maze and indicate where they smell a rat concealed in a crush-proof, aerated tube; the dog never catches the quarry. While dog owners may see it as time-honored pursuit, rat-hunting riles animal-rights advocates. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which opposes hunting in general, expressed outrage after video of a dog snatching rats in a New York City park surfaced online two years ago. PETA Spokesman Martin Mersereau calls the alley rat quests 'a twisted blood sport masquerading as rodent control.' Reynolds counters that 'there are lots of worse things that people do to rats,' noting that poisons can sicken the animals for hours. As for the dogs, they have sometimes gotten stuck in waste bins or tumbled into holes, and a recent night left two with scrapes. But Reynolds says none has ever been seriously hurt or fallen ill. In one recent foray, the dogs dispatched 13 rats within about a half-hour. The dogs prowled and prodded for about 90 more minutes before the group gave up for the night. # . But not to worry, said dachshund owner Trudy Kawami. 'There will always be a million rats in the naked city.'","Group, known as the Ryders Alley Trencher-fed Society, meet every week .

"By . Richard  Shears . Published: . 11:50 EST, 5 June 2014 . | . Updated: . 02:31 EST, 9 June 2014 . A New Zealand oil rig worker, who claimed to have seen 'MH370 on fire' over the South China Sea, revealed today that he had lost his job for reporting the incident. Speaking for the first time about the sighting of a 'burning aircraft' and the loss of his job, Mike McKay remained positive about the contents of an email he had sent, in which he said: 'I believe I saw the Malaysian Airlines plane come down. The timing is right.' And he said that the ongoing search for the missing airliner raised many unanswered questions, adding: 'The investigators do not inspire trust.' Scroll down for video . A New Zealand oil rig worker lost his job for reporting that he claimed to have seen Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 on fire . Mike McKay claimed to have seen the aircraft 'burning' while it was flying over the South China Sea . Mr McKay was working on the Songa Mercur oil rig off the southern coast of Vietnam on the night of March 8 when he saw what he believed was a burning plane. This comes as families of missing passengers have offered a $US5 million reward for information leading to a breakthrough in the mystery. Perth woman Danica Weeks, the wife of missing New Zealander Paul Weeks, said that contradictory information about the plane's disappearance has prompted families to mount their own effort to find answers. The Reward MH370 campaign, to be financed via fundraising website Indiegogo, aims to raise at least $US5 million ($A5.41 million) 'to encourage a whistleblower to come forward with information'. 'We have been cut off so many times at the gate that we're just now having to take things into our own hands, think outside the box and just try and do something to find this plane,' Mrs Weeks told ABC radio. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said on Thursday independent research confirmed searchers were looking in the right place for the plane . The latest information and analysis confirms that MH370 will be found in close proximity to the arc set out in this map and labelled as the 7th arc. At the time MH370 reached this arc, the aircraft is considered to have exhausted its fuel and to have been descending. As a result, the aircraft is unlikely to be more than 20 NM (38 km) to the west or 30 NM (55 km) to the east of the arc. Mr McKay sent an email to his employers, which in turn was leaked to the media who gained access to his name, place of work, the rig operator, Idemitsu, as well as McKay's contractor and rig owner Songa Offshore. The email address was inundated with so many inquiries that the operators' communications became blocked. 'This became intolerable for them and I was removed from the rig and not invited back,' he told New Zealand's Sunday Star Times. The 7th arc: The seventh arc on this globe is the area where MH370 is thought to be. The arc was determined by measuring the time difference between communication messages sent between MH370 and an Inmarsat satellite . He said that although he was paid up until the end of his work period, he was released from the rig five days earlier. Mr McKay, a drilling fluids consultant who has worked mostly in South East Asia for the past 35 years - the last six almost continuously in Vietnam waters - is now looking for more work. In his email, Mr McKay gave what appeared to be credible details of a burning plane. He described his exact location on the oil rig, the compass bearing of where the aircraft was in relation to the rig, the approximate distance of the plane from the rig, the current on the water surface and the wind direction. False hope: Search teams have given up listening to pings detected by this machine as it's now been confirmed they did not come from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's black box . This diagram shows where the pings were detected, around 1,500 miles north west of Perth, in western Australia. They lead to the search area being defined to a smaller space around them, but they have now been discounted from the investigation . New method: The American navy then used the Bluefin-21 (pictured being hoisted on board Ocean Shield) to map the ocean floor. The autonomous vehicle was managed by the Royal Australian Navy Ship (right) The plane, he said in the email, was not on the normal flight path scheduled jets flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing took - a fact he knew because 'we see the contrails every day.' He signed off his email with a 'good luck', followed by his full name and New Zealand passport number. After reading the email, Vietnamese authorities interviewed the New Zealander and started an initial search - but two days after speaking to him the search in the South China Sea was called off when the hunt for MH370 switched to the Andaman Sea and then to the southern part of the Indian Ocean. Back in March the AMSA (Australian Maritime Safety Authority) was searching this relatively small area for MH370. This handout satellite image shows a map of the planned search area on March 24, 2014 . Since then, he said, neither the Malaysian nor Australian search teams had contacted him. Just last week, British yachtswoman Katherine Tee, 41, reported seeing an airliner on fire on the same night as Mr McKay's 'burning plane' - but she was in a totally different area, sailing east from southern India to Phuket in southern Thailand. She told of seeing a plane surrounded by bright orange lights, leaving a trail of smoke as it pased above her. Mr McKay told the New Zealand paper that his sighting placed the aircraft around 2000kms (1200 miles) from the location of Ms Tee. He said he was unsure if MH370 could have flown that far, asking: 'How far can a burning aeroplane fly?' A New Zealand author, Scott Maka, has released his thriller e-book 'MH370' just three months after the plane disappeared . Danica Weeks, the wife of missing New Zealander Paul Weeks, is disgusted at the release of the book . Mr Weeks with his two young sons Lincoln, 3, (left) and Jack, 11 months (right) In New Zealand, author Scott Maka has released his thriller e-book 'MH370' just three months after the plane disappeared. However Danica Weeks, the wife of missing New Zealander Paul Weeks, told stuff.co.nz that she was disgusted at the release of the book. The Perth wife of Mr Weeks, who have two young sons together, found out by a text message from Malaysia Airlines that her husband had likely been killed when the plane crashed in the Indian Ocean. Meanwhile, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau sparked renewed hope in the search for MH370, saying  a study completed after the 2009 Air France crash concluded that the majority of aircraft in loss-of-control accidents were found within 32km of their last known position. 'This provides a reasonable limitation for the size of the search area across the arc.' The satellite data indicates the Boeing 777 flew for six hours after falling off radar screens. A new and potentially deeper underwater search taking up to 12 months will begin in August, with a formal request for tender to undertake the search to soon be released, according to The Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre. Meanwhile, a Chinese vessel is currently conducting a bathymetric survey - or mapping of the ocean floor - to help experts determine how to carry out the next stage of the search on the previously unmapped ocean seabed. Recently, there have been many claims of knowledge about the whereabouts of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight. Curtin University in Western Australia released information that an underwater sound recorded just 10 minutes after the plane lost contact with air traffic control could have been the plane crashing into the water. However, Dr Alec Duncan from the University said there is only a 10 percent chance the 'dull oomph' was actually MH370. And a British sailor reported she spotted what she believed to be a plane on fire with black smoke trailing behind it while on a 13 month expedition with her husband.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A bumbling arson suspect is feeling the burn after he appears to have set himself on fire while trying to burn down a building in Ohio last week. Adding significant insult to the clumsy injury is the fact that it appears that this is the second time the alleged firebug has failed to burn down the same building, a Masonic Temple in West Toledo. And not only did the ham-handed flame-thrower set himself on fire while failing to burn down the temple, video of the entire humiliating incident was recorded by surveillance cameras - and released onto the Internet by authorities looking to track down the culprit. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Oops: The unidentified firebug tried to burn down a Masonic temple in Ohio - and managed to set himself on fire in the process . Arson: The suspect approached the building about 5 a.m. Monday with what was later determined to be a brick with a rag attached to it . According to authorities in West Toledo, the suspect attempted to burn down the Masonic temple at 5025 Secor Road about 4:56 a.m. Monday. Surveillance cameras recorded the unidentified suspect drive up to the temple, get out of his vehicle and walk towards the building. Shortly after the suspects walks towards the building, a burst of light is seen coming from the side of the Temple as the suspect is seen scampering away. Bad aim: The suspect apparently was not satisfied with his first attempt to set the building on fire . Try, try again: After missing his target, the man goes back for the flaming brick to try again to set the building on fire . When the fire appears to burn out, the suspect is seen running towards the building, apparently to try again. When he backed away, the man's hand appeared to be on fire. He then jumped in his car and drove off. Police in West Toledo say that fire officials determined that the suspect had used a patio brick with a burning rag attached to it to break a window at the temple on the north side of the building. The rag, officials say, was found on the lawn. Bad idea: After his second attempt to torch the building, the man appears to set himself on fire . See ya: After failing to burn the building down - and setting himself on fire - the bumbling firebug ran back to his car and drove off . Still standing: Authorities say the suspect did about $300 in damage to the building in what appears to be his second failed attempt to burn it down . At the end of the day, the failed flaming brick did about $300 in damage. Authorities say someone attempted to set the same temple on fire on May 14. An investigation is ongoing to determine who attempted to set the building on fire, and whether the two attempts are related.","The clumsy firebug attempted to burn down a Masonic temple in Ohio .

"By . Joel Christie . The 73-year-old victim of an alleged attempted murder in Honolulu - who was thrown 20 feet after being hit by a car driven by a self-titled professional surfer and model - believes the crime was actually a carjacking that was foiled by a quick-thinking good samaritan. Elizabeth Conklin is recovering in hospital from multiple injuries after being mowed down on Wednesday as she exited her car in the garage of her Waikiki apartment complex. Jill Hansen, 30, has been charged with attempted murder in relation to the incident, with police saying she ran into Conklin and would have run into her again, if not for a building worker running over and smashing the back window of Hansen's car with a crowbar, causing her to flee. Authorities initially believed the attack stemmed from an earlier road rage run-in, however Conklin said there was no such encounter, instead assuming Hansen was trying to steal her car. 'I parked in my normal parking place, and I got out and all of a sudden I woke up in an ambulance,' Conklin told ABC News. Scroll down for video . Lucky to be alive: Elizabeth Conklin, 73, who was thrown 20 feet across the parking garage of her Waikiki apartment complex, says her attacker was after her car . Charged: Jill Hansen, 30, has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly running down an elderly woman with her car in Waikiki . Jill Hansen was arrested on suspicion of intentionally striking a 73-year-old woman in a Wai­kiki parking garage with her car. She has a history of driving problems . In an effort to get Hansen's attention and stop her from hitting the woman again, a bystander used a crowbar to break one of the car's windows . Hansen is alleged to have followed the victim back to her apartment complex in Waikiki, waiting for her to get out of the car and then running her down . Jill Hansen is a self-described professional surfer and model . 'She saw my car, it was the car she wanted, she followed me (and) was going to kill me to get the car.' Conklin has thanked Chris Khory, the man who stopped Hansen, for saving her life. Khory told Khon2 that after knocking Conklin down, Hansen got out of her sedan, looked at the victim lying on the ground, got back in the car and reversed, preparing to hit her again. Khory, who works at the apartment complex on Kalakaua Ave, said he quickly grabbed a nearby crowbar and ran over and smashed Hansen's back window. Stunned, Hansen got out and fled, leaving behind her car. Police used it to track her down, arresting Hansen six hours later in the Manoa area, and later charged with attempted murder. She was remained on $1 million bail. However, before she was arrested, Hansen posted a picture of a BMW 328 wagon - believed to be the same car as Conklin's - along with a message about how she had turned professional as a surfer. 'I am becoming a professional! I have worked SOOOO hard to get to today. I am so greatful for all the support of the surfers and the ASP (association of surfing professionals),' Hansen posted on May 14, along with the picture of the car. Conklin was taken to hospital with cuts, bruises and a head injury. She was hospitalized in serious condition, emergency officials said. This is not Hansen's first run-in with police. She has a pending assault case and in a separate case was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation. Wanted: Jill Hansen posted a picture of this car, a BMW 328 Wagon, as well as a waterfront home in Hawaii, in the hours after the alleged attempted murder and before she was arrested on Wednesday . Police used Hansen's car, which she left at the scene after running away, to identify her and track her down . Police arrested 30-year-old Jill Anjuli Hansen shortly after 7 pm on May 14 . The incident occurred in the garage of the Diamond Head Apartments on Kalakaua Ave in Waikiki . Surfer Jill Hansen was arrested for attempted murder .

She has multiple rants on the social media site. She claims to be a professional surfer and model and lashes out at critics. According to the court documents, Hansen's father says she used Facebook to find someone to murder him and his family. He has a restraining order against his daughter . Police said Hansen followed the older woman through the parking garage's security gate and then intentionally hit the woman with her car after she had exited her vehicle . Police said Hansen and the older woman do not know each other, and there was no apparent motive . According to Insurance News Net, Hansen is known in Honolulu for being a worry on the roads. A member of the Mau­na­lani Heights Neighborhood Security Watch, who asked not to be identified, said the group alerted its members about Hansen last year after several incidents involving erratic driving and behavior. 'We needed everybody on the lookout for her - that's how scary it was,' the member said. 'All 500 members were eventually brought into the loop of this situation because it was so serious.' 'There were probably over half a dozen people that had been adversely affected by her driving. 'Two people almost run over by her, one person almost had a head-on collision with her.' Hansen was not arrested in connection with those incidents, the member said. Bad reputation: Jill Hansen was allegedly known around her neighborhood for her driving record, and not in a good way, sources say . According to court records, Hansen was cited three times for speeding since February, the most recent time on Sunday. In that incident she was allegedly driving 72 mph in a 35 mph zone in Wahiawa. She is set to appear in court for that case in June. She was also ticketed for using a mobile electronic device while driving in July. She received a $147 fine. In addition, in 2011 she received fines for disregarding a stop sign, driving without a license and driving without insurance. In 2013 she was fined for driving without headlights. She has two convictions, one for speeding and the other for driving without a license in 2010, according to the state Criminal Justice Data Center. Besides her driving offenses, Hansen was arrested April 18 for investigation of third-degree assault. She is scheduled to appear for that case in District Court on Friday.

"By . James  Nye . An Alaskan abuse victim who was beaten with a shovel and left to sleep outside by his adoptive parents more than a decade ago has won a $1 million settlement from state social services. T.J White, 20, was awarded the sum on Friday following Alaska's Office of Child Services decision to place him with Anchorage couple Patrick and Sherry Kelley in 2001 - despite repeated complaints from his immediate family about abuse. The Kelley's were jailed in 2004 for 17 months for the treatment they dished out to T.J over three years, which included breaking his arm and keeping him outside for so long he had to endure maggots infesting open wounds. Settled: Thomas Joseph White has been awarded $1 million from Alaska's Office of Children's Services for abuse suffered more than a decade ago . Baptized Christian by his cocaine addicted mother, he was re-named Brandon by the Kelley's and now is on his third name, Thomas Joseph White. He was taken away from his drug-addicted mother in July 1999 after authorities received 26 reports he was at risk of being hurt because of her and her partner's drug problem. He then went to live with his great aunt and in July 2000, it was decided that he should go and join his other step-brother and sisters who had been placed with Patrick and Sherry Kelley at their home in Anchorage. They had excellent references and state services said that they were doing such an excellent job with T.J's three siblings that it made sense to place him there. At first, T.J remembers a happy life playing basketball on the streets with his two stepsisters, one step-brother and neighbors. Then, suddenly, the Kelley's told the children in their care that they could no longer play outside. All the furniture was removed from their bedrooms. Locks were placed on the outside of their bedroom doors. Guilty: Sherry Kelley and Patrick Kelley in the Alaska Superior Court in Palmer, Alaska, Friday, on September 17, 2004 during their trial. Kelley and her husband Patrick were arraigned of 54 counts relating to their treatment of their adopted children and eventually served 17 months in prison . Speaking to The Anchorage Daily News, T.J said that he was confused by what his new carers were doing. 'Us kids thought it was our fault,' said T.J, who has grown to stand 6'9"" since being taken away from the Kelley's in 2004. His aunt, Betsy Golan noticed the change in demeanor in her nephew when she flew from her home in Fort Lauderdale to visit in May 2001 for an unannounced visit. 'All the kids ran to the door,' she said to the Anchorage Daily News. Golan recalled how the Kelley's refused to invite her in and tried to get them to meet at a local McDonald's instead. Insisting on seeing how the children lived, Golan said that when she and her police officer husband entered the house they saw the locks and a bucket in the corner of the children's rooms, which acted as a toilet. 'It wasn't like a little boy's room with toys and shoes and magazines or comics,' Golan said in a recent interview. 'It was like somewhere very very very frightening.' Golan and her husband contacted Alaska's Division of Family and Youth Services but according to her, no one even came out to hear or take an account of their troubling story or returned their phone calls afterwards. Despite the large settlement, state officials have refused to take responsibility for the abuse suffered by T.J and say they have no record of the complaints. The aunt should have called police if she was so concerned they have said. However, the worst was still to come. After May, 2001, the Kelley's moved to a remote compound near Big Lake in Alaska and put the children to work on the land. They pulled them out of school and began to systematically beat T.J. and his siblings. 'No matter what we said, we were just constantly getting beat,' he said. Change: T.J. suffered horrifying abuse at the hands of his adoptive parents Patrick and Sherry Kelley in the early part of the century . 'At first it started out with belts and switches and hands and whatnot. When we moved out to Big Lake, it was logs, metal pipes, shovels, anything they could get their hands on.' T.J has said that Sherry Kelley was the worst and despaired to The Anchorage Daily News that the worst part was her parent's were their neighbors and didn't act to protect the children. They were banished outside in Alaska's freezing temperatures and slept huddled up where they could in tarps and under broken-down vans on the property. The children were given kerosene lanterns in winter for heat and one evening T.J awoke to find himself on fire after falling asleep next to one outside. Patrick Kelley threw snow on him to put the blaze out. Even though he suffered third-degree burns across most of his body, he was never taken to the hospital and the Kelley's kept his wounds clean by rubbing alcohol on them - causing T.J. excruciating pain. In one horrific account, T.J. said that one night as his burns were healing he felt something moving on his legs and looked down. Maggots had begun to live and infest his wounds and the Kelley's used a bristle brush to get them out. One winter day following that, he was moving wood around the property and the glove he was wearing on his right hand had a hole over the finger. 'It just got colder and colder,' T.J. said. He lost his finger tip to frost-bite afterwards. In another violent incident, Sherry struck him in the face with a shovel and knocked out a tooth and T.J said he would only be fed if he worked so hard he wanted to pass out through exhaustion. At last, Sherry's parents phoned the police in July 2004. Engaged: T.J is now engaged and hoping to be married this year to his fianceé . She panicked and tried to escape with T.J. and his youngest sibling - all the while hitting T.J. with a metal pipe in the car. His arm broke and swelled to twice the normal size. They ended up in a Walmart, where Sherry bought T.J. some gummy worms, but became so annoyed he couldn't open the bag she grabbed them off him and threw them out the window. Eventually they returned to the Big Lake compound where state troopers arrested the Kelley's. T.J. spent the next three weeks in the hospital, undergoing skin grafts and treatment for malnourishment. 'I got food and a bed and a TV, people to see and talk to,' he said. Patrick and Sherry Kelley ended up facing between them faced 92 counts of abuse, neglect, kidnapping and child endangerment for their treatment of the children. The charges were changed in a plea deal to felony assault and criminal nonsupport against Sherry and felony child endangerment against Patrick. They each served 17 months. Grandfather, George Long and his wife, Shirley, the children's grandmother, were charged with mistreating the children as well. T.J. is adamant that although he understands that the state believed the Kelley's were good parents on paper, they should have followed up with visits and listened to the complaints of his aunt. 'They could have checked in on us at random times,' T.J. said. 'They could have looked in the background of all of us kids and seen that we looked like a troubled group.' Christy Lawton, director of the Office of Children's Services said that the state will admit no wrongdoing. 'The only lesson to be learned was that OCS does not have a crystal ball that will perfectly predict the future,' she said to The Anchorage Daily News.","T.J.

"By . Lydia Warren . When Mad Men star Vincent Kartheiser bought his first Hollywood home, he veered a little off script - opting for a tiny, one-bedroom bungalow over a lavish mansion in the hills. And now the 34-year-old actor, who plays account executive Pete Campbell on the hit show, is selling the completely renovated and perfectly designed 603-square-foot bungalow for $808,000. The compact home on a quiet Hollywood street is filled with clever space-saving designs that make for a sleek and practical living space - from a hidden fire pit to a bed that descends from the ceiling. When he bought the bungalow for $547,000 in 2004, it was divided up into a series of rooms - but in 2010, he started working with designer Funn Roberts, who knocked down the interior walls to create one large space. Compact: Actor Vincent Kartheiser is selling his 603-square-foot Hollywood bungalow for $808,000 . Tiny house: When he first bought the home, it was divided into smaller rooms - but it's now one large area . Homeowner: Mad Men actor Vincent Kartheiser is pictured with his fiancee and co-star Alexis Bledel . Kartheiser, who is originally from Minnesota, worked with Funn to plan the tiny living space. 'What often happens in our relationship is I come to Funn with an idea and then he makes it into something that’s actually livable,' Kartheiser told Dwell magazine in an interview last year. 'Because I have these thoughts that seem really interesting, but they're not really good for real life.' The bed can be hoisted to the ceiling using a pulley system to allow for more space during the day. It's counterbalanced by a 300-lb weight hidden in the closet, Zillow explained. Snug: A red theater curtain can be pulled across the bedroom section for more privacy . Smart: When the bed is not being used, it can be hoisted to the ceiling using a pulley system . Space-saving: Once the bed is pulled up, its headboard can be flipped down to be used as a desk . Modern: The designer worked with Kartheiser's original kitchen appliances but used teak for new cabinets . Hidden: Behind a line of back-lit panels on one wall, the designer hid a bathroom and closet space . Revealed: The sleek bathroom has a stone shower, a tub and a sink carved from a boulder, pictured . The bed's headboard is made from a redwood slab that can be pulled down to become a desk once the bed is pulled to the ceiling, Dwell magazine reported. But when the bed is down, a red curtain can be pulled across a section of the main room to allow for more privacy. When it's not in use, the curtain is hidden behind a closet door. Other back-lit closet doors line the walls of the home - concealing closets and a bathroom. Inside the bathroom, there's a stone shower, a tub and a sink carved from a boulder. There are other secrets in the private courtyard, where a coffee table opens up to reveal a fire pit. The yard also leads to a detached spa . room, which includes double showers, a steam room and dry sauna, as well . as a laundry room and powder room. These are not included in the . square footage. Kartheiser is famously frugal, telling The Observer in 2010 that he craved the simple life after finding success in his career. Outside: Through doorways in the bedroom, there is a private deck which has a fire pit beneath a table . Relaxing: On the other side of the deck, there is a spa (left), which is not included in the square footage . Haven: The spa area has a dry sauna, pictured, as well as a steam room and powder room . Luxury: The spa area also has double showers for after the visit to the sauna or steam room . Simple: There is also space for one car - although Kartheiser previously said he walks or takes the bus . 'It was in response to going to these Golden Globe type events and they just give you stuff,' he explained. 'You don't want it. You don't use it. And then Mad Men started to become a success on a popular level and people started sending me stuff, just boxes of s***. Gifts for every holiday, clothes. 'One day, I looked around and thought ""I don't want this stuff, I didn't ask for it"". So I started giving it to friends or charity stores, or if it is still in its box I might sell it for a hundred bucks. I liked it so I didn't stop.' He even lived without a toilet for a while - he would use the neighbors' instead - while the home was under construction. But after 10 years of owning his little slice of Hollywood, Kartheiser, 34, is perhaps looking to move somewhere larger with fiancee and fellow cast member, Alexis Bledel, 32. The pair began dating in 2012 and became engaged in early 2013. The home is being sold by Tregg Rustad of Rodeo Realty, which calls the listing 'a rare offering of an incredibly well designed home'.

"By . Lydia Warren . Where is she? Mother-of-two Jennifer Huston, 38, vanished as she ran errands in Oregon on July 24, but a new sighting placed her in Washington on Thursday . The search for a missing Oregon mother-of-two has expanded to the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington state - about 300 miles from where she was last seen eight days ago. Jennifer Huston, from Dundee, Oregon, was captured by surveillance cameras taking out cash at a bank, filling up her car with gas and then buying snacks and sleeping pills at a Rite Aid on July 24. But the married mom-of-two has not been seen since. Her cell phone stopped working minutes after she was seen at the gas station and she has not used her credit cards in the past week. As questions swirl around what could have happened to Mrs Huston, authorities are now searching the San Juan Islands, where Huston would enjoy visiting her family, Fox reported. Authorities say she could be there or could be on her way there. Captain Jeff Kosmicki of the Newberg-Dundee Police Department said her car, a 1999 dark green Lexus LX 470 SUV, would be able to travel 300 to 350 miles after she filled up the tank. She was filmed filling up her car at a Circle K gas station around 6.20pm last Thursday. Before, she withdrew a small amount of cash from the Oregon First Community Credit Union, then bought a Gatorade, trail mix and non-lethal sleeping . pills at a Rite Aid pharmacy. Last seen: Police released these surveillance footage . stills of Mrs Huston's car at a gas station just minutes before she vanished last Thursday. Her cell phone stopped working shortly after . Her husband Kallen, who has passed a polygraph test, told investigators his wife had left to run errands and had been complaining of a headache for several days before she went out. As she left the gas station, her cell phone stopped working - either because it ran out of battery or because it was switched off. Authorities say they need more technical date to determine which direction she was heading in, and they also are trying to get the bank security footage to share with the public in case they can help. But so far, they are struggling to get their hands on what they need because they have to be able to prove a crime has been committed - which they cannot. As the search expands, aerial searches are also being carried out. Mr Huston has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't seen a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car . Mrs Huston was a stay-at-home mother to her two sons, aged two and six. Her husband previously said he'd told them she was on vacation because he couldn't bear to tell them the truth. He also expressed his fears that she might be 'in a ditch somewhere' after driving her car off the road and urged motorists to look out for his wife.. 'I ask that anybody helping us, . regardless of the area they are in, look off to the left and off to the . side of the highways,' he said. 'This is totally unlike her. She's a . devoted mother. She’s just a very good person, and for her to do . something like this is completely out of the norm.' She was last seen wearing black and pink Nike shoes and black yoga pants. Her car, a 1999 Lexus LX 470, has an Oregon license plate of WXH 011. Mrs Huston's mobile phone has been switched off since her disappearance on Thursday. Her family has created a Facebook page to share photographs and information .","Jennifer Huston went to run errands on July 24 but did not return home .

Cruel: Ziggy could barely walk under the weight of his thick, matted hair when he was found last month . Abused: The Shih Tzu-type dog was found by a passerby in an abandoned house on July 17 . 'It took two staff members three hours late into the evening with simultaneous clippers going to get the job done,' a staff member wrote on the shelter's Facebook page. 'We were incredibly disappointed after freeing Ziggy from his suffering, only to find that he was still unable to walk due to the distress his body had endured for such a long period of time.' Ziggy was then sent to extensive physical therapy - where he quickly improved. He learned how to walk properly again at the New York Veterinary Specialty & Emergency Center by walking on an underwater treadmill, SPCA officials explained. The services were pro bono. 'We were ecstatic to see what an amazing job they have done with his physical therapy and he was even able to get up to a little trot today!' staff wrote on Facebook, six days after he was found. He was also neutered and microchipped, and staff said he was friendly, although apprehensive. Looking good! Ziggy has re-learned how to walk with physical therapy and is heading to a new home . On the mend: Vets said he was a friendly but apprehensive dog following his ordeal . He is now going home with a couple in western Suffolk County who do not want to be identified. They have considerable experience with dogs with special needs, Newsday reported. 'I am very, very happy that this dog is . going to get the home he deserves after the torment he's been suffering . for many years,' said Roy Gross, chief of the Suffolk SPCA. Even though the last tenants moved out of the home a year ago, officials do not believe Ziggy had been there for all of that time. Neighbors said they never saw the dog with the previous tenants. Authorities are still looking for his former owners. A $2,000 reward is being offered for information about the person who neglected the dog, officials said. Anyone with information can contact the Suffolk County SPCA at 631-382-7722.","The Shih Tzu-type dog was found in an empty home on July 17 and it took staff three hours to remove four pounds of matted fur from his body .

"By . Lydia Warren . Strangers from across the country have raised more than $48,000 to keep a student at Vanderbilt University after her mother committed suicide and her father lost his job. Cassie Wessely, 19, from Grayslake, Illinois, was left $24,000 short for the upcoming school year - despite a summer job, savings, a scholarship, a student loan and financial aid from the school. So last week, out of desperation, she created a . GoFundMe page to try to raise $25,000 to . ensure she could return to the college for her second year. After just three days, it had raised more than $6,000 and now it has topped $48,000 as nearly 1,000 people from across the country donate amounts between $5 and $100. Determined: Cassie Wessely launched a fundraiser to help her pay for her second year at Vanderbilt University. She struggled after her mother committed suicide last year and her father lost his job this year . 'There are really no words to say how thankful I am,' she told Today. 'When I saw $5 donations, I knew that was from people who didn't have the money to give, but they gave anyway.' Some of the donors have said they were also affected by suicide, while others are people she knows or Vanderbilt alumni wishing her well. On the page, Wessely explains that her mother, Karen Peregrin Wessely, had residential custody of her when she graduated from high school. Her mother was unemployed and her financial aid at Vanderbilt was determined by her income. A year at the Tennessee university, including tuition, fees, accommodation, books and other . expenses, can reach more than $62,000 a year. Missed: Her mother, Karen, took her life last year after struggling with the death of her son five years prior . But just three weeks before the teen headed to college, her mother killed herself. Wessely explained to Today that her mother had struggled with her brother's death from an overdose five years prior. 'It was a difficult year, but I did my best to persevere,' Wessely wrote on her fundraising page. But after her . freshman year, she lived with her father in Chicago and he took on . residential custody of her, so her financial aid was based on his 2013 income. Then earlier this year, he lost his job. With the financial aid already based upon his previous earnings, Wessely learned that she was about $24,000 short for the year. So she turned to the fundraising website to ensure she could continue studying towards her biomedical engineering degree. Kindness of strangers: More than 1,000 people have raised more than $48,000 for the teenager . With the donations already far exceeding her target, she said she will put the extra money towards paying for her junior and senior years. She plans on leaving the fundraiser up until school starts on August 20. 'It is overwhelming, but in a good way,' she told The Tennessean. 'It was just so touching, and I'm so grateful and I was so . blown away by it all.'","Cassie Wessely was left $24,000 short for her second year despite a summer job, a scholarship, a student loan and financial aid .

"By . Lydia Warren . and Associated Press . A teenager whose leg became trapped by rocks at the base of a waterfall in Washington state has been saved by quick-thinking sheriff's deputies and firefighters in a dramatic rescue scene. Johnny Napierkowski, 19, was stuck in the 60 degree water at Dougan Falls on the Washougal River for around an hour on Monday night until rescuers used an advanced rope harness system to help pull him free. Authorities said the teen was lucky to be alive, explaining that if he wasn't so tall - he stands at 6ft 7 - or if the water level had been higher, they would have been recovering his body rather than rescuing him. Napierkowski had been swimming with four friends and his younger brother at Dougan Falls when he saw one of . his pals slide down the rocks of the area's lower waterfall and plunge into the water. Napierkowski thought it looked like fun so he went after him. Rescue: Skamania County sheriff's deputies and firefighters can be seen rescuing John Napierkowski, who was trapped in the water at Dougan Falls on the Washougal River, with a series of ropes and harness systems. He became stuck after trapping his leg in rocks . 'I thought it was safe, and it wasn't,' he told The Columbian from his hospital bed. 'It was a hard lesson learned, but it's learned.' As he landed in the water, he turned and his right leg became wedged between a rock and the pressure of the water, trapping him. The . tall teen was able to keep his head above water as he yelled for help . and grabbed on to nearby rocks to hold himself up against the current. 'It felt like I kept . getting tackled over and over and over again,' he said. 'There was no . way for me to be able to move. It was one big, continuous force pushing . me away.' A witness called . 911 at 8.10pm and, while his friends waited for rescuers, they tied . together two belts and used it to help keep him above the water, while . other bystanders threw in ropes, the Columbian reported. Struggle: The ropes helped the tired teen stay afloat until he was positioned so that he could free his leg and head back through the waterfall . Freed: Emergency responders tend to Napierkowski, who was trapped in the cold water for about an hour, before he was taken to hospital for treatment . 'They're all my heroes,' he said. 'The whole time, I was thinking, wow, my brother might not have an older brother pretty soon.' When authorities arrived, they found the teenager chest-high in the water. Emergency . crews tied ropes to him and also gave him a life jacket, Skamania County Sheriff Dave Brown . said. Then they gave him a harness and attached an additional rope. 'First . responders then began pulling on the rope from upriver and were able to . free Napierkowski,' a press release from the sheriff's office said. The . teen told the Columbian that he had to summon enough energy to push . himself through the waterfall to escape danger. 'I felt like my leg was going to snap or something,' he said. But, 'I knew I wasn’t getting out any other way.' Napierkowski, who was trapped in the 60 degree water for around an hour, . was taken to Peacehealth . Southwest Medical Center, where he remains hospitalized as he recovers . from hypothermia, muscle damage and extreme fatigue. On the mend: Napierkowski, pictured with two friends, was hospitalized with hypothermia, muscle damage and extreme fatigue but is on the mend . Authorities warned people to exercise extreme caution near the waterfall. 'This stretch of warm weather has kept . first responders busy throughout the area,' Brown said. 'We encourage people visiting the Dougan . Falls area and other popular swimming areas to be safe, use a life . jacket when necessary and know the hazards so that you can avoid trouble . if possible.' Napierkowski is not the first person to become trapped in the area below the falls. Four years ago, a 14-year-old boy from Wilsonville, Oregon, got his leg trapped between boulders in the river below Dougan Falls. The water in that case reached to the boy's nose before he was rescued.","Johnny Napierkowski, 19, was swimming at Dougan Falls on the Washougal River on Monday night when he slid down some rocks and his right leg became trapped between the force of water and rocks .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Lydia Warren . Doctors have been working tirelessly over the past two weeks to keep Sharon Budd alive after a football-sized rock tossed from an overpassed shattered her skull. Screws, bolts and plates now hold together the face of the 52-year-old seventh-grade teacher from Uniontown, Ohio, who was left with a large, gaping wound across her forehead and broken bones when she was struck on July 10 in Pennsylvania. That is when police say four teenagers — three now charged as adults, one as a juvenile — decided to throw rocks from an Interstate 80 overpass as Budd, her husband and a daughter happened to be passing through, on their way to see a show in New York. Praying for recovery: Sharon Budd, 52, pictured with her husband, three sons and a daughter, has a long road ahead of her after her skull has been shuttered in a random rock attack . 'Blood on their hands': Brett Lahr, 18 (left), and his 17-year-old brother Dylan (right), are facing aggravated assault and conspiracy charges along with two other teens in the rock-throwing case . That first night, surgeons at Geisinger Medical Center did what they could to clean out pieces of her skull that were jutting into her brain. They also removed parts of her intact skull to allow for the swelling they knew would soon follow. ‘We had to make sure that she was going to survive, that was our immediate goal for the first 72 hours,’"" Dr. Atom Sarkar, her neurosurgeon, said Monday. The damage destroyed barriers the skull forms that make separate compartments needed to avoid infection of the brain from the nose and mouth. Doctors also had to use a piece of her skull to fabricate a bridge between her eyes. Kaylee Budd, 19, one of the Budds' four children, was driving just before midnight July 10 when the rock crashed through the front windshield of their Nissan Rogue. The college sophomore stopped and turned on the light to see her 52-year-old mother, a breast cancer survivor, had suffered horrifying injuries. From some 20 feet above, the rock apparently struck Sharon Budd directly on the forehead. It hit like an explosion, said Randy Budd, who described the injuries as so gruesome that he wasn't sure what he was seeing — blood and possibly brain matter amid shattered glass. Waiting for help, Kaylee and Randy held Sharon's hands, prayed, did what they could to reassure her and tried to prevent her from rubbing her head wound. Injured: Sharon Budd, left, was struck by a rock thrown from an overpass as her family drove on I-80. Moments before, she spoke with her son Lucas, right, who is about to be deployed to Afghanistan . Shattered: Screws, bolts and plates now hold together the face of the 52-year-old married mother of four, seen left with her husband, Randy Budd . Altered: Doctors have been forced to remove the right frontal lobe of Sharon Budd's brain, which helps determine personality . Randy Budd said his wife had just . finished speaking with their eldest son, Lucas, before the vehicle was . struck by the rock. The . 28-year-old was scheduled to leave for Afghanistan with the Ohio . National Guard for a one-year deployment but his departure has . been delayed as his mother fights for her life. After hanging up the phone, she asked him to send her a photo from his station in Fort Bliss, Texas, which he did. 'He wrote back, ""I really miss you mom"",' Randy Budd said. At . the hospital, a physician braced Randy Budd for the worst, saying she . was perilously close to death and advising him to call loved ones. ‘Two . gentlemen came up and said: 2We're going to do an emergency surgery. Give her a chance to live.” I just signed. Some eye doctors came in and . basically said the same thing. I signed,’ Randy Budd said. It took her about a week to recuperate enough for ear, nose and throat surgeons to perform more comprehensive work on her face. It . was during that follow-up surgery last Thursday that doctors realized . damage to the right frontal lobe of her brain and some parts of the left . were likely to continue giving her problems and needed to be removed . during a 13-hour operation. The . frontal lobe helps determine your personality, a particularly bitter . fate for Sharon, a woman with a wide network of friends and a devotion . to her career as a language arts teacher. Loved: Mrs Budd, a teacher, is pictured with her husband Randy and 19-year-old daughter Kaylee, who were in the car but who did not suffer any injuries, and her three sons . ‘That . part of the brain actually affects your social interactivity, how she . is as a person, if she's warm and compassionate, or bubbly and . ebullient, or just quiet and reserved,’ Sarkar said. ‘That doesn't mean . that she can't be the person she was.’ Her . arms and legs appear to be moving appropriately, but doctors don't know . how her dexterity and fine motor control will be affected. It is likely . she has permanently lost the use of her right eye. A . tube in her brain was removed Monday, and although she is somewhat . sedated, she has been able to follow her doctors' commands, mostly . shaking her head or wiggling her fingers and toes, Randy Budd said . Tuesday. Doctors hope to perform additional skull reconstruction, and at some point remove the hardware. The . scar from the rock runs from her right ear across her forehead; the one . from the procedure to remove portions of her skull goes across the top . of her head, from ear to ear. Now they wait to see how she progresses. ‘We can say she's not going to die,’ Sarkar said, ‘but there's a very far gulf between not dying and being the person you were.’ Fears: Randy said when he saw her injuries, 'it was the most gruesome thing that you could ever imagine' Beautiful duo: Sharon and Randy Budd pictured on the day of their wedding decades before the July 10, 2014, tragedy . Three Pennsylvania teenagers have now been charged as adults in the near-fatal highway rock-throwing incident. Milton resident Tyler Gregory Porter, 17, appeared in court Monday on charges including aggravated assault and conspiracy. Court records indicate he told police another boy threw the rock that hit Budd's car. Two other teens, including 18-year-old Brett Lahr and 17-year-old Dylan Lahr, were previously arrested on those counts. A fourth juvenile identified only by his initials KLN was also apprehended. The group face felony charges of aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy to commit aggravated assault, and counts of propulsion of missiles into an occupied vehicle or onto roadway, possessing of instruments of crime and recklessly endangering another person, the Daily Item reported. KLM told state police that they had been driving in his Mitsubishi Eclipse when they stopped on the overpass to Interstate 80, according to the criminal complaint, the Daily Item reported. Dylan Lahr and Porter got out and threw rocks at and struck passing vehicles, KLM told troopers. He said he saw a vehicle slow down but that they fled to the Lahrs' house. They then got into the Lahr family's gold Honda Accord and drove past the scene to see what was happening and when they saw a police car, they returned to the home. Scene: A group of teenagers threw rocks from this overpass in Milton, Pennsylvania last week and one landed on the Budds' car. Four teens were arrested and now face charges in the incident . KLM and Brett Lahr headed back to the scene again and saw several more police cruisers before returning to the Lahrs' house. Police checked the license plate of the Honda, which was registered to the Lahr family, and went to their home in New Columbia. When questioned by police, Tyler Porter said he threw one rock onto I-80 but did not strike a vehicle whereas Dylan Lahr threw at least two rocks and one of them struck a car. Brett Lahr, the older brother, remained in Union County Prison in lieu of $50,000 bail, while Dylan Lahr was released on supervised bail. Sharon Budd's family has set up a GoFundMe page to help with her medical costs, which so far has collected more than $18,000 in donations. Another online fundraiser has been launched on YouCaring.com, where as of Tuesday afternoon supporters have surpassed the $25,000 goal.","Sharon Budd, 52, was driving from Ohio to New York with her husband and daughter when their car was struck with an 8lb rock in Pennsylvania .

"By . Lydia Warren . A man slashed an 11-year-old girl's throat and staged it to look like suicide after she convinced her mother to break up with him, police have revealed. Miguel Ruiz Lobo, the former live-in boyfriend of Martha Guzman's mother, was arrested on Monday for murdering the child at her home in Little Havana in Miami, Florida on June 22. The girl was found with cuts to her neck and wrists and rushed to hospital, but she did not survive. Her mother, Amauria Alvarenga, told WSVN that she immediately suspected Ruiz was involved. 'From the moment I found her, I never thought . she committed suicide, because I know my daughter,' she said at an emotional press conference with Martha's father on Monday. Scroll down for video . 'Killed': Miguel Ruiz Lobo, left, is accused of killing Martha Guzman, right, after she told her mother to break up with him. The girl was found with her neck and wrists slashed at her family's home on June 22 . Police told reporters on Monday that Ruiz, who had dated Alvarenga for several years, knew the girl had a history of cutting and so staged the killing to look as if the wounds were self-inflicted. After his arrest was announced, Alvarenga said Ruiz had emotionally abused her daughter while living at their home and the little girl had convinced her mother to break up with him. The mother broke off the relationship about five months before her daughter's death. Ruiz had claimed he had not seen the victim for days but a neighbor's surveillance camera revealed him using a key and going inside the family's home before leaving 32 minutes later. No one entered the home until her mother arrived there three hours later and found her daughter. Police also said that Ruiz had fresh scratches to his face and arms, and DNA taken from beneath the girl's fingernails showed his DNA, revealing she had put up a fight against her attacker. Devastated: Her mother, Amauria Alvarenga, pictured with the girl's father, said she knew the little girl hadn't committed suicide and had immediately felt that her former boyfriend was to blame . Missed: Martha (right), pictured with a friend, was a popular A-grade student, her parents said . Authorities said there was a clear motive for the heinous crime. 'It all stems from the little girl and . her mother did not get along with Mr. Ruiz, who was the boyfriend of the . mother, and eventually the little girl convinced mom to break up with . Mr. Ruiz,' Miami . Police Chief Manuel Orosa said. 'Mr. Ruiz was not happy about it. He returned to the house when the girl was . alone. He used a key that he knew the whereabouts of the key, and we . believe he entered and killed the young lady.' He added: 'He's . such a huge monster of a man that could control her easily, and . eventually he did and killed her.' Afterwards he slashed her wrists, Orosa said, but the cuts were so deep that her hands were nearly severed completely off, CBS Miami reported. Scene: Surveillance footage showed Ruiz going into the home, pictured, and leaving after 28 minutes . Both of the girl's parents, who separated five years ago, sobbed as they spoke about their loss at a press conference outside their home in a Honduran community on Monday. 'It's not easy,' her father Jose Guzman said as he wiped away tears. 'I cry every night, every day, anytime.' Martha was a straight A student and won numerous student awards, her parents said. Photos also show her grinning in dance costumes among friends. Ruiz was charged with first-degree murder. He will appear in court for a bond hearing on Tuesday.

"By . Lydia Warren . The Wu-Tang-affiliated rapper who chopped off his own penis has denied reports that doctors re-attached the member - but insists he sees it as a 'blessing'. 'I definitely believe sex is for mortals, and I am god. So this is a blessing, not a curse,' Andre Johnson, who goes by the stage name Christ Bearer, told the New York Daily News. But he explained that he still has part of his penis left and can still get aroused. The 41-year-old Northstar rapper sliced off his genitalia inside his North Hollywood apartment on April 16 before jumping from the second floor, in what authorities branded a suicide attempt. On the mend: Andre Johnson, who goes by the stage name Christ Bearer, said he still has some of his penis left after he sliced it off while high on PCP in April - but the rest of it was not reattached by doctors . But he has since rebutted the report, insisting that he was simply high on PCP. The psychedelic is known for causing people to jump from ledges because they think they can fly. 'It's a drug that I had stopped doing for years, but I just got back from Ohio and got back into that lifestyle for a few days,' he told the Daily News. 'It definitely was not wise.' A 911 call from the incident later revealed his panicked friends pleading for help. 'We have a friend over here and… we . don’t know if he’s alive or not [after jumping from] the second floor… I . don’t believe this s**t,' said the unidentified person. As police arrive at the apartment, the caller can be heard saying: 'You gotta come get him, he cut his . damn penis off. We were sitting on the . balcony and this mother f****r just came and [jumped]'. After the incident, his penis was found upstairs in his apartment and Johnson was hospitalized at the Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

He . said he felt his 'world was collapsing' after being prevent from seeing . his two daughters due to a restraining order, and that he had a third . child on the way. Mutilation: Johnson, right, said he had been reading a book about castration before taking the drug . Just two weeks after the incident, he welcomed a new daughter, Kennedy. He also has two other daughters, Lana, 2, and Lauren, 8. Despite saying that the penis was not reattached, he has recently said he wanted to star in porn. ‘Does it work?!? Can Chris Brown dance? Can Kanye West rant? Can Jay Z fight off a trick?’  he said when TMZ asked about his injuries a couple of weeks ago.

"By . Lydia Warren . Angry: Zyad Younan, 41, says he was drugged and scammed out of $135,000 by strippers . A cardiologist who is being sued for $135,000 in unpaid bills by a New York strip club has detailed how he was allegedly lured into a stripper crime ring, drugged and then robbed of the sum. Zyad Younan, 41, has accused Karina Pascucci, 26, Samantha Barbash, 40, and Marsi Rosen, 28, of slipping a substance into his drink before racking up the huge debts while he was unconscious or not in control of his actions. The three women worked for Scores, a strip club that is now suing Younan for the bill after he told American Express he had been swindled and they reversed the charges. But Younan has finally given his side of the story in papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court and has blamed the club as well as the women, the New York Daily News reported. 'Scores along with (the dancers) engaged in a conspiracy and scheme to steal money from Younan by drugging him, taking possession of his credit card without his knowledge or permission, and charging unauthorized and exorbitant amounts to that credit card,' the court papers say. Younan, who is single, explained that he first became involved with the women when he went out to dinner with at a Manhattan restaurant and was approached by Pascucci, who claimed she was a nursing student. They swapped numbers and she later asked him out to dinner. They enjoyed several dinners together, as well as a concert, and on some occasions, she brought Rosen and Barbash with her, falsely claiming they were her relatives. 'Scam': He said he was approached by Karina Pascucci, left, while out having dinner and they went out several times. She introduced him to 2 friends she claimed were relatives, including Marsi Rosen, right . During those evenings out, the women slipped a drug into his drink that 'caused him to enter a semi-conscious state, lose the ability to act voluntarily and make knowing decisions, as well as lose his memory,' the suit claims. He said he was shocked when he got an American Express bill for $135,303.14 in charges to a strip club - which he didn't even remember going to. He reported the charges as fraudulent and American Express reversed the charges - which left Scores and the three women irritated, he said. 'Karina desperately attempted to persuade Younan to pay the amounts allegedly due to Scores by claiming the charges were not fraudulent and that Scores had videotape of Younan at the club,' the papers claim. 'Ringleader': She also introduced him to Samantha Barbash, pictured, and as he partied with the three women, they drugged him and then used his credit card to rack up massive debts at a strip club, he said . The women harrassed him with phone calls and text messages, he claimed, forcing him to tell Pascucci to make them stop, adding: 'I don’t need to speak with swindlers.' But they didn't stop, and Scores staff also began contacting him, he said. The club then filed suit against him and argued that it had Younan on video four times over a 10-day period in November handing out big tips and going to a private room with five women. Their lawsuit alleges Younan 'voluntarily came to plaintiff’s place of business and requested that plaintiff provide him with food, beverages and services'. Costs at the club can certainly soar; it costs you $20 to get through the door and bottles of champagne can sometimes cost more than $1,000. A meal at the club can cost $250, and guests are allowed to leave tips for the dancers on their credit cards, the Daily News previously reported. Scene: The women allegedly took the doctor - and their other victims - to Scores, where they were scammed out of thousands on their credit cards. The club has denied they are to blame for the spending . Younan, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Jersey, is seeking unspecified money damages for battery, theft, conspiracy and defamation. Pascucci, Barbash and Rosen were arrested last month with two others for allegedly drugging and scamming wealthy men and scamming them out of almost $200,000. After their arrests, they were accused of prowling bars in Manhattan and Long Island for their victims over a four month period beginning in September 2013. A banker, a lawyer and a real estate attorney were also among their alleged victims. No criminal charges have been filed against Scores but the investigation is ongoing. The club did not return MailOnline's call for comment.","Zyad Younan 'was approached by Karina Pascucci, 26, in a bar and asked him out on a date so she could scam him with two others strippers'

"By . Lydia Warren . One of Canada's most infamous serial killers is engaged to be married after wooing a woman from behind bars, it has been reported. Paul Bernardo, 50, who is serving an indeterminate sentence for the heinous rapes and murders of two schoolgirls in the 1990s, a dozen rapes and more than two dozen other sex offenses, is set to marry a 30-year-old blonde university graduate from London, Ontario, the Toronto Sun reported. The woman, who has not been identified, has been writing to the convicted murderer since last fall and now displays a tattoo on his ankle reading: 'Paul's girl', friends said. Without identifying him, she has told friends that he is 'innocent' of his crimes, which include raping, torturing and killing schoolgirls Kristen French, 15, and Leslie Mahaffy, 14, with his then-wife. 'Husband-to-be': Paul Bernardo, who is serving a life sentence for murdering two school girls in the 1990s, is reportedly engaged to be married to a woman who started writing to him. He is pictured in 1993 . 'He is a kind man, a Christian, a very nice man,' she said. While the woman has denied she is marrying Bernardo when speaking to her concerned parents, she did not deny their nuptials were on the horizon during interviews with the Sun. She's also bought wedding bands, she told friends. The friend added: 'He told her not to tell her parents until after they were married.' If they do marry, they would be allowed 'private family visits' of up to 72 hours once every two months - although prison staff would have 'regular' contact with the inmate and visitor to ensure their safety. Despite her letters to Bernardo - which she told her parents she initially send because she was researching a book on him - and the wedding bands, she is having second thoughts, the Sun said.

Killed: The couple also kidnapped Kristen French, 15, who was tortured for three days before she died . Her parents said they understood how the woman, who has had 'a number of bad relationships that undermined her self-esteem despite her brilliance', was manipulated by Bernardo. But they also believe she is reconsidering the choice as 'reality has set in.' 'I've been . very explicit that he actually did these things and reality sunk in this . last week in a big way,' her father said. Partner in crime: His first wife Karla Homolka also served time but now has three children . He said that he and his wife had confronted their daughter earlier this year after learning that she was corresponding with him and advised her to stop. When the Sun told her about the potential wedding, her father was stunned and later said she completely denied it. Friends also said she had been cagey about her new relationship. 'She did . mention she was seeing somebody named Paul, that he had done some time,' the friend from the woman's university days said. 'She . said it wasn't really him who did it. He was just there and it was the . worst crime you could imagine. She maintains he’s innocent. 'She made it sound like he was a working accountant in Toronto and they had wedding bands.' Bernardo, 50, is serving a life sentence for the murders of the two schoolgirls, whom he kidnapped, tortured and murdered. He was also declared a dangerous offender in 1995 after pleading guilty to 32 sex-related crimes, including 12 rapes in the east end of Toronto dating to 1987. He is eligible for day parole on February 17, 2015 and full parole on February 17, 2018, but because of the notoriety of the case, it is unlikely he will be paroled, the Sun reported. He was married to Karla Homolka, who helped him capture his victims, but they have since divorced. Homolka, who also helped Bernardo drug, rape and ultimately kill her younger sister Tammy, was convicted of manslaughter for her role in the slayings of French and Mahaffey and served 12 years in prison. She wasn’t charged in the death of her sister but her sentence took the incident into account. A Toronto journalist tracked down Homolka two years ago and found she was living in Guadeloupe in the Caribbean with her three children. She had reportedly married her lawyer's brother.","Infamous Canadian serial killer Paul Bernardo 'is engaged to university-educated woman after she first started writing to him last Fall'

"By . Lydia Warren . Toronto Mayor Rob Ford today claimed that rehab saved his life as he returned to work following nearly two months in rehab. The beleaguered politician, 45, looked decidedly slimmer at the press conference as he apologized for his previous outbursts and drug use, and said he took full responsibility for his actions. 'Like a lot of people dealing with substance abuse, I was in complete denial,' he said at the press conference at City Hall. 'But soon it became obvious that my alcohol and drug use was having a serious impact on my family and on my health and on my job as mayor. 'After experiencing some of the darkest moments in my life, I decided that enough was enough. I had become my own worst enemy.' Scroll down for video . Apologies: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford apologized for his actions on his first day back on the job following rehab . Do you think Rob Ford will relapse? Ford said he underwent 'intensive therapy' and physical training at Greenstone rehab center in Bala, Ontario, where staff forced him to confront his 'personal demons'. 'I now know that the staff at Greenstone saved my life,' he said. 'Thanks to my treatment I can proudly say today that I have begun the process of taking control of my life.' He continued: 'But folks, this is a long long road to recovery. No matter what I do, I will never be able to change the mistakes that I have made in the past. 'When I look back on some of the things I have said and some of the things I did when I was using, I am ashamed, embarrassed and humiliated. I was wrong and I have no one but no one to blame but myself. I want to sincerely apologize.' Echoing earlier sentiments about wanting to run for re-election in November, Ford vowed to serve Toronto for 'many, many years'. Back to work: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford arrives at City Hall on Monday after nearly 2 months in rehab . Exclusive event: Media Relations officer Amin Massoudi . (center) organizes the select media outlets who are permitted into . Ford's news conference after he arrived at City Hall in Toronto . Although he thanked his family, he did not mention his long-suffering wife Renata by name in the speech. Rob Ford . Ford, who said he will continue to undergo treatment, spoke shakily throughout the appearance and would not take any questions before he left the room. He had . entered the Greenestone facility in Ontario on May 1 to be treated for . alcohol addition after announcing in April that he was seeking . treatment. He made the decision after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack; Ford . admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked . crack in a 'drunken stupor,' following months of denials. He held Monday's press conference in his protocol office - a space that holds just 25 people - so only certain publications were invited, Ford’s communications director Amin Massoudi told the Star. Unhealthier days: Ford is pictured in November last year; he looked decidedly slimmer at Monday's press conference and said he had been working with personal trainers while in rehab . The venue meant that reporters from the . national wire service The Canadian Press, Now Magazine and Toronto . Community News are not welcome - and even the president of the city hall . press gallery. The decision allowed for yet another chapter in Ford's rocky relationship with the media. City spokesperson Wynna Brown said the member's lounge, which is available, would have been more appropriate because it allows for more people. 'From a city point of view, this is not reflective of the approach or the collaborative relationships we have and value with members of the media, particularly our colleagues in the city hall press gallery,' she said. Jonathan Goldsbie, a Now Magazine reporter who was left off the invite list, told the Sun he felt 'shock, anger, frustration and momentarily, disbelief' to have been left of the list. Out and about: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford spent his final Saturday before returning to work shopping in Barrie, Ontario, where he posed for photos. He has been in rehab since the start of May . 'The . decision to hold it in the protocol lounge is an entirely arbitrary one . that offers no tangible benefit to the mayor or his staff,' he said. David . Nickle, president of the city hall press gallery and a reporter for the . Toronto Community News, said the mayor has often limited the media's . access, but never to news conferences. 'I feel the mayor should be facing all the Toronto media that are interested in hearing him,' he said. Ford previously announced plans to launch his re-election campaign on July 1 - Canada Day. Speaking to the Toronto Sun, he said: 'I will be back, I guarantee you. I am coming back and you will see a different Rob Ford.' He said he felt 'great' and was benefiting from the self-imposed exile. Treatment: Ford had entered the Greenestone facility in Ontario, pictured, in May and likened the experience to going to football camp as a youngster . 'It . reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I . went to as a kid,' he said, adding 'I am working out every day and I am . learning about myself, my past and things like that.' But he said he was missing his family; the only time he had seen his wife and children was for a trip to Crabby Joe's on his birthday, and he added that he was anxious to get back to them. On the subject of his addiction, he acknowledged that it was his own fault. He said: 'No one has enabled me. We were talking about the enabling thing the other day in a meeting. You do booze or drugs because you want to do it. I take full responsibility. I have learned my lesson.'","Ford entered rehab for alcohol addiction treatment on May 1 after 'another video emerged showing him smoking crack'

"By . Lydia Warren . A former football player who fell into a coma after he was brutally beaten two months ago has been pictured holding the baby girl his wife delivered while he was in critical condition.

'It continues to amaze us the connection he . has made with her through this ordeal,' his wife Molly wrote alongside the picture on CaringBridge. 'He truly, truly knows he is a . daddy.' Baby Malia was born on June 5 in the same hospital where her father was in critical condition with a traumatic brain injury after he was attacked near a bar in Mankato on May 11. Naptime: Isaac Kolstad, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in a bar fight in May, is pictured with his daughter Malia, who was born while he was in critical condition. He remains in hospital for rehab . Rutgers University quarterback Philip . Robert Nelson, who once played at the University of Minnesota, has been . charged with one count of first-degree assault and one count of . third-degree assault. Trevor . Shelley, 21, who authorities believe punched Kolstad, was arrested just . days after the attack and charged with felony assault counts. Kolstad, described by a friend as 'a quiet, young . man' who was not a big drinker, was with a group of football players in . the South Street Saloon just before closing time on the night of the fight. According to a criminal complaint cited by NJ.com, 20-year-old Nelson was angry that night because a bouncer at the bar had hit on his girlfriend. Together: Kolstad, a former MSU Mankato football player, smiles with his wife Molly and daughter Haidyn . Family: Molly, right, gave birth to baby Malia in June in the same hospital where her husband was being treated . As he left the bar with his girlfriend, he saw Kolstad . outside.

Graduate student Steph Stassen, 25, told the Star Tribune that the attacker came 'out of nowhere'. 'He [Kolstad] was knocked out on his feet,' she told the paper. 'He fell straight back and smoked his head on the pavement.' He was found at an intersection around 2am by police and taken to hospital in an ambulance. Kolstad suffered bleeding of the brain, . skull fracture, brain swelling, brain shifting, and deterioration of . lungs from lack of oxygen, according to the criminal complaint. He is now being treated at an inpatient rehabilitation program in the Twin Cities. There, he has bonded well with his new daughter, his wife Molly wrote.

He is now re-learning how to walk . 'When I get to the hospital, he gives me a . smile then reaches to hold Malia,' she said. 'When Malia cries he is the first to . reach out and want to hold her and comfort her.' Molly, a registered nurse who also has a three-year-old daughter with Kolstad, added that he is going from strength to strength in rehab, where he is undergoing occupational, recreational, physical and speech therapy. She said that he is now up and walking with the help of two therapists who support his upper body, and he can now walk 1,500 feet a day. 'Isaac's interactions with us keep getting better as well,' she said. 'His laugh has always been one of my most favorite sounds and I am just so excited to be getting that back.'

"By . Lydia Warren . An Oregon family are appealing for help after their baby boy was born with webbed fingers and toes. Baby De Sean's grandmother, Evelyn Ellis, is behind a GoFundMe page to raise at least $10,000 for the two-month-old's much-needed reconstructive surgery and the support he'll need as he heals. De Sean was born with a rare condition that melds his fingers and toes together called split-hand split-foot malformation. It means that he is missing some digits, while others are fused together. Both of his hands and feet are affected, which doctors told the family only happens in one in a million cases. 'When my . daughter heard that, she cried: ""My baby boy is one in a million!"",' Ellis told MailOnline, laughing. 'They could not be more happy with their son. We would . not trade him for the world.' Scroll down for video . One in a million: Baby De Sean was born with a rare condition that fuses his fingers and toes together . Their doctors have said they often leave . the surgeries until children with the condition are one to three years . old, but De Sean's case is more severe, so they want to get to work . right away. The . grandmother is now trying to raise money to support . the family as the little boy undergoes surgeries, which need to be . carried out as soon as possible to ensure that the boy can adapt to his . new hands and feet. 'My job as . his grandma is to support his family,' said Ellis, who works for Portland School District. 'Obviously he's my . grandson but he is perfect. He melts the heart of everyone he meets. I . couldn't be more proud of him.' The . family is hoping they can raise enough money on the fundraising website, which has already reached $5,000. Some . of the costs will be covered by Shriners Hospital for Children, but the . family will be left to foot the bill for further tests, as well as . travel expenses. Proud: His grandmother, Evelyn Ellis, pictured, has launched an online fundraising campaign for his care . 'Long road ahead': Prints show the boy's foot and hands; in surgery, his fused fingers will be separated and straightened, while the clefts down the middle of his hands will have to be closed . Split hand/split foot malformation, also known as ectrodactyly, is a genetic disorder in which some fingers or toes are completely or partially absent, often combined with clefts in the hands or feet. There may also be the appearance of webbing between fingers or toes, which is called syndactyly. The appearance may make the hands or feet look like claws. It is a rare form of a congenital disorder in which the development of the hand is disturbed. The incidence of cleft hand varies from 1 in 90,000 to 1 in 10,000 births depending on the used classification, but because both of De Sean's hands and feet are affected, doctors said his case is one in a million. Surgery can be carried out to improve function of the fingers and thumb and to reduce the webbing between fingers. His parents both work full time - 28-year-old De Andre at a bank and 25-year-old Seanna at a hospital - but Ellis predicts that they will have to take leaves of absence from work. 'The only way he's going to thrive is in the arms of his mom,' Ellis said. 'There's no way she can work full time and look after an infant as he goes through all of these surgeries.' Ellis said she expects that it will take more than a year for her grandson to undergo surgeries and plastic surgery, which should leave him able to walk once he's old enough. 'His fused . fingers on his left hand need to be separated and straightened, and the . cleft (gap) where both hands and feet split in utero, will need to be . surgically closed,' she explained on the site. She added that his pointer fingers each have an extra bone, which will need to be shaved down. The . doctors will carry out the surgery in stages - first focusing on his . left hand and foot before moving on to his right hand and foot. It . means that Ellis wants to raise enough money to help her family as soon . as she can, and she said she has been overwhelmed by the response from . family, friends, colleagues and strangers. 'He has so many family members in California that have never had the opportunity to meet him,' she said. 'They decided to take the money they were going to spend on visiting him and put it towards his care instead. That is an amazing gesture.' Cute: The bouncing baby boy requires reconstructive surgery on both hands and feet as soon as possible so that he can adapt to them. Doctors usually leave it later but want to move quickly in De Sean's severe case . Happy: Both of his parents, pictured, will have to take time off work as they help him with his recovery, Ellis said . After the surgeries and reconstructive procedures, the family will also undergo genetic testing to deduce how likely De Sean is to pass it on to his own children. The boy's mother, Seanna, had six ultrasounds throughout her pregnancy and the deformity was never detected. Ellis said there is also no family history of the condition. After the testing - which could cost upwards of $12,000, Ellis said - the family hope to work to spread awareness of the condition in his community and further afield. 'We've got a long road ahead of us but De Sean has the most amazing parents and is surrounded by so much love,' Ellis said. 'When I look at him, I don't see difference, I see ability. He's going to thrive and how cool is that?' The family has a U.S. Bank account under the name 'Baby De Sean Fund' or you can visit the site.","Two-month-old baby De Sean was born with a condition called split-hand split-foot malformation that melds his fingers and toes together .

"By . Lydia Warren . and James Nye . John Edwards' eldest daughter has revealed that she sees his love child at Christmas but has no relationship with his former mistress. In a frank interview, Cate Edwards said she sees her half-sister Frances Quinn less often than she sees her parents' younger children but that she's interested in having a good relationship with her. 'I saw her at Christmas,' she told the Washington Post. 'She’s down there in Charlotte, [North Carolina]. It’s not as easy.' When asked if she had any relationship with Rielle Hunter, who had an affair with her father while her mother was battling cancer, she promptly responded: 'No.' Scandal: Cate Edwards, left with her father after he was found not guilty of misusing campaign funds in 2012, said she wants a relationship with his daughter Francis Quinn, right with her mother Rielle Hunter . Cate . Edwards, an Ivy-league educated lawyer who now works with her father, . has long stood by his side - through the revelations about his affair . and his court battle, which found him not guilty of misusing campaign . funds to cover up the relationship. Friends of Cate explained to The Washington Post that anyone's shock at the . support John Edwards receives from his daughter needs to understand . this time in their lives. When Cate was 14, her older brother Wade was killed in a car crash in 1996. Cate . recalled her parents falling apart in the aftermath of their eldest son's . death - so much so that Cate moved into their bedroom to console them. 'For . them, the worst had already happened,' says Sunjung Kim, Cate’s . roommate for four years at Princeton. 'Everything that came after was . just something to be dealt with.' Cate told The Washington Post . that she wouldn't discuss her mother and father's marriage but that . Wade's death was integral to her relationship with her father. Presidential campaign: John . Edwards with his family in January 2008, with his wife Elizabeth and . children Emma Claire, Jack and Cate. At this time . Elizabeth knew of the affair - but thought it was a . one-night stand . 'I’m really not going to get into their relationship,' said Cate. 'In terms . of my relationship with the two of them, when you’ve been through the . things we’ve been through together, this wasn’t like losing Wade. It was . not as bad.' Edwards, a former vice-president candidate, had met Rielle Hunter on February 21, 2006 when she walked into the bar at Lowes . Regency Hotel in New York and told him, 'You're so . hot!' Their . disastrous affair was discovered by Elizabeth in December 2006 - two years after her cancer diagnosis - but at . the time Edwards told . his cancer-stricken wife it was a one-night stand. Speaking with the Post, Ivy-league . educated Cate, who has since set up a law firm with her father, revealed . the moment she found out about the affair. Her father broke the news to . her in 2007 or 2008 - she can't remember which - just before it hit the . tabloids. 'It . was important from dad's perspective to be honest with me,' she said in . the interview, which was held to celebrate her new partnership with her . father on his successful return to practicing law. 'He . was very emotional in telling me...We hugged and I said, 'I love you'. That's generally how it went. He was, he was upset,' said Cate. Tragedy: Edwards leaves his wife's funeral with his children Jack (C) and Cate (R) in December 2010 . In August . 2008, the news emerged that Edwards had fathered a child with his . one-time aide, Rielle Hunter and his campaign to become president . imploded - as did his marriage to Elizabeth, after Christmas, one year . later. On . December 7, 2010, days after Cate, now 32, was engaged to her college . sweetheart Tevor Upham, her mother passed away after battling cancer for . almost six years. In 2012 her father came close to prison during his trial on charges of violating campaign finance laws, but Cate stood by him. She . stood by him even after the revelation during that trial of the . harrowing moment her mother ripped open her blouse to show Edwards her . breast cancer surgery scars after The National Enquirer first reported . his affair in October 2007. 'I had my moments of self-pity,' she said. 'I've never reacted with anger exactly. I mean, you know I was . angry at my dad for a while. We worked on, we worked very hard to repair . our relationship.' The . politician made headlines again in April, when he and Cate were turned . away when he tried to get into socialite Bunny Mellon's funeral in . Virginia. Focal point: The death of Wade Edwards in 1996 bonded Cate, her father and mother in a way that only those who have gone through something similar can appreciate according to her friends . The . financial relationship between the disgraced politician and the . reclusive heiress nearly twice his age was made public during the former . Senator's 2011 trial which delved into the alleged misuse of the . hundreds of thousands of dollars that Mellon gave to Edward's campaign. Though he . was found not guilty of illegally using the more than $700,000 Mellon . donated, he has apparently not won back the support of the now-deceased . socialite's family. Bunny, whose real name was Rachel Lambert Mellon, died from natural causes on March 17 at the age of 103. The . New York Post reports that Edwards showed up to Mellon's funeral in . Upperville, Virginia on Friday with his eldest daughter Cate but they . were given the cold shoulder. When . they arrived, they were kept out of the service at Trinity Episcopal .

"By . Lydia Warren . A mother who was acquitted of killing her ex-husband 20 years ago has been sentenced to up to 41 years for shooting and paralyzing her adult son with the same gun. Linda Cooney, 66, was found guilty in April of attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon and intimidating a witness for the June 2011 attack on her son, Kevin, in their Las Vegas home. On Wednesday, she cried as she was sentenced to 13 to 41 years in prison and told the judge that she had been wrongfully convicted, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported. It comes more than two decades after she was cleared in the death of her former husband James Cooney on February 7, 1992 amid a bitter divorce battle. She claimed she had shot him in self defense when he came at her with a knife. Scroll down for video . Heading to prison: Linda Cooney reacts as she is sentenced to 13 to 41 years in prison for shooting her son . Kevin Cooney's testimony when he was just 11 years old had been key to . his mother's acquittal, the prosecutor in the case, Peter Magrino, told . the Sun Sentinel. He . had initially told police that his father's hands were empty when he . saw him killed on the floor, but in the 1993 trial in Palm Beach, . Florida he said that his father may have been holding something. In . 2011, she shot Kevin in the neck in Las Vegas with the same .357 Magnum . after an argument about his girlfriend, whom Linda Cooney had been . accused of stalking. Again, . Cooney, a former legal secretary, claimed she shot out of self defense . after her 6ft 9 inch son, a bouncer at a local club, had attacked her . during the argument. And again - he defended his mother. Paralyzed: Kevin Cooney, who was shot in the neck, testified in court (pictured) that he was to blame . In court: Chris Cooney, another son of Cooney, listens as his mother is sentenced to prison on Wednesday . Testifying from a motorized chair, he . said that she had shot him after he attacked her. He said that he . blamed himself for the incident. Denial: Cooney said that she had killed her ex-husband James, pictured, in 1992 in self defense . But . his testimony was at odds with other statements made in the court; an . ex-girlfriend testified that he told her his mother shot him as he sat . on the couch. The . argument that led to the 2011 shooting came after years of tension over . Kevin Cooney's girlfriend, Karina Taylor, whom he met in 2009 but did . not tell his mother. Taylor . told authorities his friends had said she should avoid meeting Linda . Cooney because she was 'crazy and it would cause nothing but problems'. And when Cooney did finally meet . Taylor, she was against the relationship - and allegedly sent her a . series of texts calling her a 'stripper,' 'w****,' 'prostitute' and . 'skank'. She also . contacted a non-profit cancer organization where Taylor volunteered and . said that she was laundering money and dealing drugs, prosecutors said. Prosecutors added that Taylor was genuinely fearful of Cooney, and this led to the argument on June 28, 2011. Police . received two calls alerting them to the scene - one from Cooney and one . from Kevin's younger brother, Chris, a Las Vegas police officer. Freed: Her son testified in the 90s that he might have seen his father with a knife and Cooney was freed . Home: They argued over Kevin's girlfriend, whom Linda had allegedly called a 'skank' and 'w****' But . the calls came after a 15-minute call between Cooney and Chris. By this . point, Kevin had been shot and reportedly told his brother he could not . feel his legs. When Chris called police, he said that his brother had attacked his mother and that she had shot him, and Linda Cooney called police to say her son had been shot in the neck. Cooney refused to answer about who was responsible for shooting her son, although at one point said: 'The gun, it's my fault, it's my fault.' When police arrived, Kevin was lying down with a cloth pressed to the right side of his neck and when they asked him who had shot him, he refused to say - and kept calling it an accident. Questions were also raised when Linda Cooney contacted her son via a cell phone while he was in hospital.","Linda Cooney was acquitted after claiming she shot her ex-husband, James Cooney, in 1992 in self defense as he came at her with a knife .

Maryanne Schwartz, 22, told police her daughter Yeliani Schwartz-Ojeda had been knocked over in the parking lot outside their Orlando, Florida apartment block on Friday evening. But the autopsy report has thrown doubt on her claims - showing the girl was malnourished and that her body temperature did not match up with the timing of the car accident, WKMG reported.

Questions: Maryanne Schwartz, 22, (left in court) told authorities that her three-year-old daughter had been the victim of a hit-and-run accident but the autopsy has thrown doubts on the claim . The autopsy report concluded that Yeliani died of blunt force trauma, but it could not determine whether she had been struck by a car. A representative with DCF said investigators interviewed other children, who belonged to Schwartz's partner and lived in the home. The oldest child told the investigator they are hit as punishment, sometimes with sandals, but he said that the three-year-old girl had been treated the worst. 'The deceased child was always not listening and she was spanked and her hair had been pulled and different accusations of discipline due to her not listening,' said investigator Chandra Jones. All of the children have been removed from the home, WKMG reported. Among the children is Schwartz's two-year-old son, who also had bruises on his body, authorities said.

"By . Peter Allen . Upheld: France's parliament passed a burka ban in 2010, leading to protests from Islamic groups who said it was discriminatory. (File picture) An attempt by a British legal team to reverse France's burka ban was today rejected by the European Court of Human Rights. In a test case which will have widespread implications in other countries, judges said that the measure aimed at stopping women covering their faces in public was entirely justified. They said that the right of ordinary people to 'live together' was a 'legitimate objective', and that Muslim women wearing face coverings threatened it. France's parliament passed a burka ban in 2010, leading to protests from Islamic groups who said it was discriminatory. Today lawyers for an anonymous 24-year-old university graduate told the Strasbourg-based court that the ban was 'degrading' and a 'breach of religious freedom'. The complainant, identified only by her initials SAS, is a French citizen but has family in Birmingham. Her British lawyer Tony Muman told the court at an earlier hearing that she is a 'perfect French citizen with a university education. She speaks of her country with passion. She is a patriot' SAS in turn said in a written statement that being forced to take off her veil in public constituted 'degrading treatment'. The law, which came into force in 2011, means women who wear full-face veils in public can be fined around £130. There have been arrests and convictions in France, but attempts to enforce the ban have also sparked disturbances, including a riot in the Paris suburb of Trappes last year. An appeals court in Versailles, near Paris, is today considering the case of a man who attacked police when they stopped his veiled wife, and he ended up with a three month suspended prison sentence. France has the biggest Muslim population in western Europe, and many believe that society has an agenda against them. This belief was reinforced last month when the far-right National Front, a party which has numerous policies aimed at stopping the spread of Islamic culture, made huge gains in European elections. Ruling: Judges at the European Court of Human Rights said that the right of ordinary people to 'live together' was a 'legitimate objective', and that Muslim women wearing face coverings threatened it . Belgium and parts of Switzerland have also introduced bans, and similar ones are being considered in Italy and Holland. Plans for one in Britain have also been mooted by backbench MPs and other politicians, including members of the UK Independence Party. Today's European ruling is likely to increase calls for the burka ban to be adopted by other countries.","Muslim groups protested after France passed its ban on the veil in 2010 .

"By . Lydia Warren . The movie director father of Elliot Rodger, who shot six people dead in Santa Barbara last month, said he initially thought his son was a victim and only discovered the truth when looking online. Peter Rodger, who worked on the Hunger Games, spoke about his 22-year-old son for the first time in an interview with Barbara Walters, which was aired in full on ABC on Friday. 'I thought he was a victim,' he said. 'It wasn't . until 4.30, 5am that I found out by going on the internet that he was the . main suspect and there was only one killer. 'When I saw that, it was like - it's one's worst nightmare. I can't describe the feelings.' Scroll down for video . Grief: Director Peter Rodger has given an exclusive interview to ABC about his son, 22-year-old Elliot Rodger, who killed six people before taking his own life in Santa Barbara last month . Breaking his silence: Rodger spoke with ABC's Barbara Walters and said that while he thought his son could be suicidal, he never believed he would have been capable of killing other people . Just hours earlier, he had found out in a Home Depot parking lot that his son had been killed, after he and his ex-wife raced to Santa Barbara after receiving their son's 137-page manifesto. In the manifesto and in YouTube videos, the younger Rodger had outlined his murderous plans, which he said were 'retribution' for years of girls ignoring him and refusing to have sex with him. Still, Peter Rodger says he did not think his son was the killer until hours later. After arriving in Santa Barbara, they were met by a sheriff in the parking lot. 'I'll remember this forever the rest of my life,' he said. 'The way [the sheriff] just looked me in the eye, and he said, ""We've found a deceased person and we found a license in his pocket that fits your son's description"".' ABC US News | ABC Sports News . Killer: Elliot killed six people after releasing this video entitled 'Retribution'. He explained in a lengthy manifesto that he was getting back at all the women who had never wanted him . Later that night, after learning that . his son had been the killer, he was overwhelmed with sorrow for the . victims of Elliot's crimes. In the interview, Walters asked Rodger if he wished his son had never been born. 'That's a really loaded question,' he said, pausing. 'A part of me says yes. And the reason is because he did an awful lot of harm to young men and women who didn't deserve to die, and my son did it.' In the interview, he described how his son changed from a happy boy - 'he would laugh so much that sometimes we were worried he would choke' - to a subdued and anti-social teen with no friends. Rodger said his son has become obsessed about not having a girlfriend and being a virgin, but when his father offered to take him to Las Vegas 'to do something about it' he declined. Rodger told Walters he believed his son was jealous of how he looked, and said: 'This is the American horror story. When we have someone who on the outside is one thing and on the inside is something else.' He added that his son was an 'incredible liar' but said: 'Elliot was far from evil ... Something happened to him. He was the most beautiful, kind, sweetheart of a boy. And something happened to him.' Now that he is trying to cope with the death of his son and his victims, he said every day is a nightmare. Scene: Rodger opened fire on students in Isla Vista before plowing into a skateboarder and eventually crashing his black BMW. Police wounded him before he took his life inside the car . 'Every night I go to sleep, I wake up . and think of those young men and women who . died, who were injured and terrorized. And my son did that,' he said. 'My son caused so much pain and suffering for so many families.' Walters asked if the father had any clue that his son was suicidal or even homicidal. Rodger replied: 'There . is no way I thought that this boy could hurt a flea. The most . unbelievable thing, what I don't get, is that we didn't see this coming . at all.' Rodger said he would like improvements made to the mental health system and questioned why, when police do welfare checks, they don't also run a gun check. 'It takes 90 seconds,' Rodger said, adding that if police had performed that check on his son 'it would have thwarted his whole plan'. Elliot Rodger's mother, Chin, declined to speak to Walters on the show, sending a statement instead saying she believed the focus should be on the victims' families. The special episode of 20/20 aired . on June 27 at 10pm. It was Walters first return to television since . retiring on May 16. While she won't have a regular show . anymore, Walters will continue contributing to ABC for special projects . like the interview with Mr Rodger.

Above, Rodger (left) and Richard Martinez, father of killed UCSB student Christopher Martinez, 20 . Difficult: The father of a college student who was gunned down in the May 23 mass killings near the University of California, Santa Barbara said he met privately with the father of his son's killer in early June . Elliot . Rodger killed six people between the ages of 19 and 22 on May 23 after . years of what he claimed was rejection and ridicule and sexual jealousy . because he was a virgin. The . bodies of James Hong, David Wang and George Chen were found at a . beach-side apartment near the University of California, Santa Barbara . campus. Rodger also fatally shot three at random - Christopher Martinez, Katherine Breann Cooper andVeronika Elizabeth Weiss. He . took his own life after his shooting rampage and it was claimed in the . days afterwards that his family had tried to get him professional help . weeks before the massacre. In the days after the killings, Mr Rodger met up with Richard Martinez, the father of one of the victims, and they were pictured embracing. The parents of two young men shot dead by Elliot Rodger spoke out this week about losing their sons in a tragedy that they feel could have been prevented. David Wang, 20, and George Chen, 19, were stabbed to death by their roommate Elliot Rodger, 22, at their beach-side apartment near the UC Santa Barbara Campus on May 23. Rodger also killed James Hong, Christopher Martinez, Katherine Breann Cooper andVeronika Elizabeth Weiss before taking his own life. George's mother Kelly Chen broke down as she told CBS: 'We have love in our heart, tears in our eyes, responsibility on our shoulders, and we hear the voice from our children from heaven. We want to do something.' The devastated parents of David Wang, Charlie and Jane Wang (right) and George Chen, Johnny and Kelly Chen (left) spoke for the first time about their sons who were the joy of their lives. Both young men were killed along with four others by 'virgin killer' Elliot Rodger in May . Kelly Chen and her husband Johnny along with Charlie and Jane Wang believe that there were 'missed opportunities' that could have prevented Rodger's killing spree. They also expressed their outrage at the media attention focused on the killer and an interview with the victim's father Peter Rodger. They said that Mr Rodger had not reached out to them to offer his condolences. Following the interview, Mr Rodger sent the families a letter of apology. The two families, who both immigrated to the U.S. from China to give their sons' better opportunities, had said they did not want to speak out following their sons' deaths. However they feel strongly that they must do all they can so no other family would have to endure their pain. Just a month on from their sons' deaths, the parents said they struggle to cope with the idea that their boys are never coming home. Charlie Wang, David's father, said: 'I still think my son is alive and not gone. I still don't understand why this happened to such beautiful heart, beautiful lives.'

"By . Peter Allen . Twenty Roma parents and other family members who sent their own children on to the streets of Paris to rob holidaymakers were beginning prison sentences of up to eight years each yesterday. British visitors were among the hundreds of tourists targeted each day around the Louvre, Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower by some 40 youngsters. There were disturbances in the court late on Friday afternoon when the tough sentences were handed down. The heaviest went to women – including mothers – involved in the crime network. In action: Roma children snatch catch in Paris. Twenty Roma parents and other family members who sent their children on to the streets to rob holidaymakers were beginning prison sentences of up to eight years each . The senior judge of three involved in the case, Dominique Piot, said: ‘Each minor had to steal two wallets a day, or two or three mobile telephones.’ He said those imprisoned were ‘involved in industrial-scale exploitation of their own children’. Comparing them to modern-day Fagins, he said that children who failed in their targets were often beaten. The offences took place between 2011 and 2012, and  the youngsters involved were aged between nine and 17. Two women and one man were sentenced to eight years, while  a woman and a man got seven years each. All were permanently banned from France. Tourist hotspots: British visitors were among the hundreds of tourists targeted each day around the Louvre (pictured), Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower by some 40 youngsters . Prime Minister Manuel Valls has continued a policy started by former president Nicolas Sarkozy of razing Roma camps and deporting their occupants. Roma child gangs operate openly in the city. Those arrested are usually released without charge within hours because of their age.","Twenty Roma parents and other family members were beginning prison sentences of up to eight years each .

"By . Peter Allen . The first female professional coach in football history has mysteriously resigned from the job without compensation before taking charge of a single match. Helena Costa looked every inch the crestfallen but resilient manager as she appeared at a press conference at Clermont Foot 63, the League 2 club based in Clermont-Ferrand in central France. ‘I only made my decision yesterday after discussing it with the president,’ said Ms Costa. ‘Before this decision, I did all my work.’ Game changer: It was less than a month ago that 36-year-old Helena Costa was heralded as a dynamic force for change in a sport traditionally dominated by men upon being appointed coach of Clermont Foot . It was less than a month ago that 36-year-old Ms Costa was heralded as a dynamic force for change in a game traditionally dominated by men. Today she refused to reveal exactly why she left, saying: ‘Only the president knows the reason for my decision. 'I hope this won’t cause prejudice towards women in the sport. I want to be viewed as a coach,' she added. Ms Costa suggested that she had least broken a glass ceiling, by becoming the first female football manager ever - albeit without actually taking charge of a training session, let alone a game. As journalists pressed Ms Costa to . explain herself further, a clearly angry club president Claude Michy . intervened, saying: ‘She leaves with her secret. She resigned without . compensation’. Career: Helena Costa has previously worked with youth players at Benfica, and coached the women's national teams of Qatar and Iran (pictured), as well as scouting for Celtic . Mr Michy said: ‘The life of the club continues’, adding: ‘The players are disappointed, because their adventure has been stolen. They were ready to live differently.’ There was speculation that Muslim players had not wanted to work with a woman boss, but Mr Michy said played this down as an unfounded rumour, saying: ‘I won’t return to this subject’. He said he had not ruled out recruiting another woman to replace the Portuguese Ms Costa, who is now expected to take a ‘long holiday’ before considering her future further. She has previously worked with youth players at Benfica, and coached the women’s national teams of Qatar and Iran, as well as scouting for Celtic. Some of the journalists at this morning’s press conference suggested the whole affair had been a publicity stunt aimed at raising the club’s international profile.","Helena Costa, 36, left Clermont Foot 63 football club without compensation .

"By . Peter Allen . Killed: Hélène Pastor, a 77-year-old socialite and businesswoman, was gunned down on May 6 . A billionaire Monaco heiress and her Cambridge University graduate husband were in custody last night suspected of 'masterminding' the assassination of her equally wealthy mother. Hélène Pastor, a 77-year-old socialite and businesswoman who was close to the royals who run the Mediterranean principality, was gunned down in a hail of bullets on May 6. She and her chauffer both died of their wounds following the attack outside L'Archet hospital in the French city of Nice, which is a short drive from Monaco. Now police believe that her daughter, Sylvia Pastor, 53, and her husband, Wojciech Janowski, 65, ordered the Mafia-style hit. A total of 19 arrests have been made in connection with the attack in French cities including Nice, Marseille and Rennes. A spokesman for the Marseille prosecutor, which is leading the investigation into the double murder, said: 'A number of arrests have been made, and a police operation in connection with the killings is ongoing.' The spokesman confirmed French media reports that Sylvia Pastor was among those arrested, along with Wojciech Janowski, who has been Poland's Honorary Consul in Monaco since 2007. Probe: A police officer investigates a car on May 6 at the site in Nice, France, where Hélène Pastor and her driver were killed . 'The arrested man, who was apprehended . by police [yesterday] afternoon, is the suspected mastermind, and is in . custody along with his wife,' said the spokesman. Born . in Warsaw in 1949, Janowski graduated from Cambridge in the early . 1970s, before getting involved in a number of major companies in the . water treatment, casino and hotel sectors. Arrested: Police believe Hélène Pastor's daughter, Sylvia Pastor, 53, and her husband, Wojciech Janowski (pictured), 65, ordered the hit . He was made an Officer of the Order of . Merit by the then French president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 for his . 'charitable activities'. Mrs . Pastor's driver, 64-year-old Mohammed Darwish, succumbed to wounds in . the face, neck and stomach - dying on May 10, shortly before his boss. Investigators suspect two of Italy's most notorious crime syndicates, the 'Ndrangheta and the Camorra, of carrying out the double assassination. Both crime gangs are said to be building property portfolios on the French Riviera as they expand their field of operations. Mrs Pastor's family own buildings worth billions in the area, and detectives believe the Mafia were trying to muscle in. Mrs Pastor had been visiting her son, Gildo, who runs a car hire company, at the Nice hospital when a solo gunman struck. In a classic Mafia-style hit, he shot . both Mrs Pastor and her chauffer in the head and stomach with a . pump-action shotgun through their car window. Following the attack, the hit man jumped into a waiting getaway car driven by another man, and then sped off. Location: Hélène Pastor and her chauffer both died of their wounds following the attack outside L'Archet hospital (file picture) in the French city of Nice, which is a short drive from Monaco . French . MP Eric Ciotti expressed his 'extreme shock' at the double . assassination, while Prince Albert II of Monaco issued a statement . expressing 'deep support' for the Pastor family. Statement: Prince Albert II of Monaco has expressed 'deep support' for the Pastor family . Mrs Pastor was the sister of Michel Pastor, the former chairman of AS Monaco football club who died in February. Her daughter and son, already rich in their own right, would have become billionaires on their mother's death. The Marseille prosecutor has now opened a judicial enquiry into the double murder, parts of which were captured on CCTV. 'We . are studying frozen images of the attack in an attempt to identify the . attackers, and witnesses,' said an investigating source. He said that an alleged blackmailer had been contacting the Pastor family, and was currently undergoing 'psychiatric tests'. Mrs Pastor's grandfather was an Italian immigrant who developed large parts of Monaco before handing his business over to her father, Gildo Pastor. The principality is a tax haven which is regularly linked with organised crime gangs, as well as prominent individuals who want to keep the source of their wealth a closely guarded secret. Brice Robin, the Marseille prosecutor, will hold a press conference on the case today.

"By . Chris Pleasance . and Peter Allen . A father was in custody in France today after allegedly strangling his son because he was spending too much time playing online games. The 43-year-old, who had not been named, launched the attack in the village of Luc-sur-Orbieu, near Narbonne, on the southern Mediterranean coast. He was at the family holiday home when he snapped because his 23-year-old son was constantly playing on his computer. A man in France has allegedly strangled his 23-year-old son to death in a row over online computer games . Police from nearby Lezignan-Corbieres attended the scene of the killing just before 11pm on Easter Monday, Midi Libre newspaper reports. 'A source close to the enquiry evokes a possible argument linked to the young man's addiction to internet games,' it says. An autopsy was due to be held to determine the exact cause of death, while the father was being held on suspicion of murder, the source added. The case resembles one in South Korea last week, in which a South Korean man strangled his infant son to death in order to carry on playing online games. The 22-year-old was charged with the murder of his two-year-old son after he admitted suffocating the child so he could leave the house and go back to playing online games at an internet cafe. In South Korea a father, 22, allegedly strangled his two-year-old son to death in order to play more games . Police arrested the unemployed man in the city of Taegu, South Korea, on Sunday after finding the body of his child in a suitcase wrapped in a trash bag near his home. The man, identified only by his surname Chung, had earlier reported the boy missing. Officers initially believed he had left his son to starve to death by abandoning him for 10 days while playing games. But Chung later confessed to 'covering the child's nose and mouth with his hand,' more than a month ago, killing him so that he could go to an internet cafe, a police officer said.","Father, 43, arrested after allegedly strangling 23-year-old son to death .

"By . Peter Allen . IN PARIS . Francois Hollande’s chief spin doctor was forced to resign today after it emerged he kept 30 pairs of handmade shoes at the Elysee Palace and had them professionally polished on taxpayers’ money. Details of Aquilino Morelle’s high living plunged the beleaguered Socialist president into yet another sleaze scandal. Mr Morelle, 51, was accused of being a ‘little marquis’ in the way he enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle while working for a left-wing head of state who ‘dislikes the rich’. Got the boot: Aquilino Morelle, left, resigned today after revelations about his shoe collection. He the chief spin doctor to French president Francois Hollande . He publicly announced his resignation at lunchtime today, while insisting: ‘I’ve done nothing wrong’. According to the investigative website Mediapart, PR chief Mr Morelle was not only infamous for his upmarket shoe collection, but helped himself to numerous perks at the Elysee. This included regularly raiding vintage bottles from the palace’s extensive wine cellar, and the use of two chauffeurs to ferry his family around Paris. Mr Morelle is also accused of a conflict of interest in the way that he allegedly breached ethical guidelines for civil servants by working for pharmaceutical companies in 2007 while also a senior official in the ministry for social affairs. It comes as Mr Hollande faces the lowest poll ratings for any head of state in the history of modern France. Tired of this: The scandal is the latest embarrassment to Hollande, who pledged to run an administration beyond ethical reproach . Not only is the French economy in free-fall following two years of Socialist mismanagement, but Mr Hollande and his cronies are regularly accused of being hypocrites. Last year Mr Hollande was forced to sack his budget minister Jerome Cahuzac because he kept half a million pounds in a secret bank account in Switzerland. Mr Cahuzac, who faces a criminal trial, was shielding his money from the French authorities, despite being responsible for clamping down on tax avoidance. Earlier this year it emerged that Mr Hollande was using taxpayers’ money to conduct a secret affair with actress Julie Gayet. This was while the French were paying for Mr Hollande’s then girlfriend, Valerie Trierweiler, to enjoy all the perks of being their de facto first lady. Despite his resignation, Mr Morelle today insisted: ‘At no point was I in a situation of a conflict of interest. ‘As a civil servant, there are a certain number of outside activities which are permitted by the law, including education and advice.’ Mr Morelle said his busy work schedule meant he needed the chauffeurs to collect his son from school, and denied that his shoe collection was excessive. However, outside work for civil servants requires authorisation and the department Mr Morelle worked for said it could find no trace of any. Following his election as president in 2012, Mr Hollande insisted he would run a government that was beyond ethical reproach.","PR guru Aquilino Morelle, 51, resigned this afternoon after the revelation .

"By . Peter Allen . Visitors to France will face travel chaos next week as air traffic controllers join rail workers in a nationwide strike. SNCTA and Unsa-ICNA, the two biggest air traffic control unions, will start the six-day strike next Tuesday – and the industrial action will last until Sunday June 29. Thousands of flights are set to be cancelled just as the summer holiday season gets into full swing. Chaos: Flights out of French airports, including Charles de Gaulle airport, will be affected by the walk-out next week, cancelling hundreds of flights . Union representatives warned of ‘heavy disruption to all flights’, and tourists hoping to take alternative rail routes will face further delays thanks to a ten-day rail protest. French retail workers are also set to strike in protest at the government’s decision to introduce Sunday opening hours to boost tourism. This will mean that famous Paris department stores including Galeries Lafayette and Printemps will be closed for those who do make it across the Channel. More than 60 per cent of France’s 4,000 air traffic controllers have voted in favour of the protest against aviation cuts. Unavoidable: The strikes are a response to President Hollande's austerity measures, which he insists are necessary . They said that the controversial measures, which will come into force between 2015 and 2019, will lead to a cheaper, less efficient system and will end up threatening ‘modernisation’. But Francois Hollande’s Socialist government insists that the cuts are necessary to comply with European Commission plans to reduce air navigation costs. The number of expected cancellations next week could be as high as 50 per cent, although there are fears that even this is a conservative estimate. Tourists have been told to expect long delays at every French airport, as the entire air system will be affected by the walk-outs. More than 17million British people travel to France each year, and huge numbers from the UK will be caught up in the chaos. EasyJet and Ryanair are preparing contingency plans ahead of the strikes, which they will announce when the scale of the disruption becomes clear. EasyJet, which operates flights to 13 airports in France, said it was ‘disappointed’ at the ‘unnecessary strike action’, adding: ‘This has the potential to cause considerable disruption and cancellations.’ The strike was announced as France unveiled a new plan to boost tourism from 82million to 100million visitors a year – by urging the French to be nicer to foreigners.","Two biggest air traffic control unions will walk out next week .

"By . Peter Allen . The bodies of five First World War soldiers have been found ‘frozen in time’ in a French wood almost 100 years to the day since they were killed. All are believed to have died on September 5th 1914, the day of a ferocious fire fight between the Allies and Germans near Luneville, in eastern France. The find is particularly poignant this week, when millions around the world will focus on the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy. The bodies of five French soldiers from the First World War have been found in a forest near Luneville almost 100 year since they were killed (pictured, French troops attack at Verdun, near to Luneville) The French infantrymen’s skeletons lay undiscovered for all those years, along with their Lebel rifles, wallets, and a figurine of the Virgin Mary. Philippe Sugg and Gerard Louis, two local historical researchers, made the discovery after studying First World War archives and pinpointing digging sites. The men were in a private forest, which remained practically untouched throughout the decades since the fighting. Mr Sugg said: ‘Documents suggest that several dozen soldiers died in the area. They were often very young men who left their families knowing there was a good chance they would never return.’ Among those ‘frozen in time’ is a 27-year-old from the southern town of Perpignan, whose name is on an identification tag. Later this week the Queen will be in France to commemorate 70 years since the D-Day landings happened in Normandy during the Second World War . Scraps of the red trousers which the French still wore at the beginning of the war were also found. Once his descendants have been informed, his body is likely to be exhumed and buried with full military honours, along with his comrades. Despite the passing of the years, France and neighbouring countries are still covered with the bodies of those who died in the First and Second World War. The Queen and other members of the Royal Family will arrive in France on Thursday to honour the sacrifice of such fallen heroes. She will be on Sword Beach on June 6th, D-Day, at a commemorative ceremony also attended by French and American presidents Francois Hollande and Barack Obama.","Bodies of five French soldiers found in wood near Luneville .

"By . Peter Allen . The leader of France’s conservative opposition resigned today after police raided his party’s offices over an alleged multi-million pound funding scandal involving Nicolas Sarkozy. In the latest financial controversy to engulf the UMP, Jean-Francois Copé, 50, stepped down as chairman. His entire opposition front bench is expected to quit too – ensuring the French right is as discredited as the massively unpopular Socialist government. In the latest financial controversy to engulf the UMP, Jean-Francois Copé stepped down as chairman of UMP . An event organiser called Bygmalion has accused the UMP of ordering £9m worth of fake invoices to cover overspends during Mr Sarkozy’s 2012 failed re-election campaign. The allegation – one in a long list against the controversial Mr Sarkozy – will almost certainly end any hope Mr Sarkozy has of returning to power in 2017. Judicial police sources confirmed that officers raided the UMP headquarters 'on Monday, in connection with the accusations' – ones that could end up with criminal prosecutions. But it is Mr Copé who fell on his sword this morning – principally because Bygmalion is run by two of Copé’s close friends. A trio of former prime ministers - Alain Juppé, Jean-Pierre Raffarin and François Fillon - will lead the UMP until October, when a permanent replacement will be appointed. Mr Sarkozy denies any wrong-doing . Patrick Maisonneuve, a lawyer for Bygmalion, said the agency ‘was told’ to issue phony invoices or it wouldn’t be paid for its legitimate work. He said the £9m in invoices sent the UMP were fake, and stemmed from work that had been done for Sarkozy. ‘They are real, but they should have been charged to the campaign of presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy in 2012,’ said Mr Maisonneuve. Jerome Lavrilleux, a senior member of UMP, also appeared on live TV to admit there were ‘anomalies’ in Mr Sarkozy’s 2012 accounts. Mr Lavrilleux was in tears as he told BFM TV channel: ‘There have been anomalies. There was no wrongdoing, there was a terrible spiral, a train going at high speed and people who should have pulled the emergency alarm and didn't, and I was probably one of them.’ Mr Sarkozy, UMP Chairman Jean-Francois Cope and Batien Millot, the founder of Bygmalion, all deny any wrong-doing. The home Mr Sarkozy shares in Paris with his third wife, the former supermodel Carla Bruni, was also raided by anti-corruption officers within a few days of him losing presidential immunity from prosecution in 2012. He has since been accused of benefitting from millions in illegal cash from a variety of people including former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi, and Liliane Bettencourt, France’s richest woman. Mr Sarkozy is currently touring with singer Ms Bruni, who performed in Tel Aviv for the first time. Despite his legal problems, Mr Sarkozy has been a constant critic of Mr Hollande, regularly hinting that he is still capable of winning the presidency again in three years’ time. The biggest winner from the latest developments will be Marine Le Pen – leader of the far right . National Front. Her party won a quarter of the vote in the European Parliament elections, and are officially the most popular party in France at the moment. In the face of the failure and sleaze of the Socialist government and UMP opposition, she has called for the dissolution of parliament. The biggest winner from the latest developments will be Marine Le Pen - leader of the far right National Front . Le Pen’s National Front scored a stunning victory, winning 25 per cent of the vote and beating President Francois Hollande’s ruling Socialists into third place. Miss Le Pen, 45, the daughter of the party’s controversial founder Jean Marie Le Pen said the victory was a ‘massive rejection of the European Union’. She hailed the ‘historic victory’ in which ‘the sovereign people of France have spoken loud and clear’. ‘The people have taken back the reins of their own destiny,’ she said. ‘This means policies of the French, for the French, by the French. They do not want to be ruled from outside.’","Jean-Francois Copé, 50, stepped down as chairman of UMP .

"By . Peter Allen . The far-right National Front made massive gains across France as Socialist president Francois Hollande faced humiliation in local elections. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the anti-immigration and anti-Europe party, described it as a  ‘breakthrough’ in the fight against the corruption and apathy of mainstream parties. The National Front won an outright majority in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont and was first-placed in the eastern town of Forbach and the southern towns of Avignon, Perpignan and Beziers. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the anti-immigration and anti-Europe National Front party, described winning an outright majority in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont as a  'breakthrough' Mr Hollande's Socialists were meanwhile heading for heavy losses as voters punished them for the disastrous economic situation. There was even talk of a vote of no confidence in the bumbling head of state who is easily the most unpopular president in the history of modern France. Almost 45 million French people took to the polls to elect more than 36,000 mayors for the next six years in what was being seen as a test for the Socialist president, whose approval rating has sunk as low as 17 per cent. The National Front hopes to increase its municipal councillors from around 50 to 1,000, and to win control of as many councils as possible. It was heading to be kingmaker in up to 200 towns where its candidates were on course to reach round two by winning more than 10 per cent of the vote. If no candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the vote in round one, the race goes to a run-off. President Francois Hollande, pictured addressing a Turkish-French business forum in January, faced humiliation as voters appeared to punish the Socialists for the disastrous economic situation . The Socialists were pinning their damage limitation hopes on retaining Paris, where Anne Hidalgo, their Spanish-born candidate, was on course to become the city’s first female mayor. Some 389 Britons are running for municipal councillor under a 2001 rule in which other European Union nationals can seek town hall posts, but they require French nationality to become mayor. Some 30 percent of voters have indicated they intend to punish the government for its failures on key issues such as soaring unemployment. Mr Hollande’s hugely embarrassing private life, which saw him effectively fire his first lady this year after being caught out with a secret lover, has also played against him. Corruption scandals involving former conservative president Nicolas Sarkozy, pictured, have also put people off backing his conservative UMP . Corruption scandals involving former conservative president Nicolas Sarkozy have also put people off backing his conservative UMP. Mr Sarkozy was pictured voting yesterday in Paris with his third wife, the former supermodel, Carla Bruni.

With the bells of Notre Dame heralding a glorious Easter Sunday morning, a tourist uses a cash point a short stroll from the ancient Paris cathedral. Within seconds he and his wife are surrounded by an aggressive gang of Roma sneak thieves, who make no secret of what they want from him. Feeling hands on his back and arms, the middle age man turns around in horror to see the utterly fearless gang casually trying to help themselves to his money. Scroll down for video . A brazen gang of thieves creep up  behind a tourist couple at a cash machine in Paris . Such scenes have become so common in the French capital that police last week called for the 'systematic eviction' of Roma. Groups of thieves, many of them teenagers, swarm around the main tourist landmarks day and night. 'They respect nobody – they just want money or anything else they can steal,' said another tourist who witnessed the incident at the cashpoint between Notre Dame and the Louvre museum, in the 1st arrondissement. 'It might have been Easter, but the gangs were everywhere,' she said. 'One minute the man was making a cash withdrawal, the next he was a crime victim. 'If the police come anywhere near the Roma, they just laugh and then run off. Areas are becoming completely lawless.' Paris is the most popular tourist destination in the world, and the British make up the city's biggest visitor group, but its battle against the Roma is a losing one. The middle-aged victim turns around in a fright as the thieves swarm around him and his wife . The utterly fearless gang casually try to help themselves to the horrified man's money . Charity and human rights groups were furious last week when a leaked police memo called for the 'systematic eviction' of Roma from the centre of the city. It followed the country's Prime Minister, Manuel Valls, saying that the travelling communities of mainly Romanians and Bulgarians 'cannot integrate' and should be deported. A spokesman for Charity group Catholic Help described the note as a 'scandal', saying that it 'stigmatised a poor community' and amounted to 'racial profiling'- something which is illegal in secular France. Getaway: The pickpockets look for their next victim after targeting the tourist using a cash point near Notre Dame Cathedral, Paris . But other Paris officials argued that Roma are behind most of the crime in the city, involving themselves in everything from aggressive begging to muggings and burglaries. Gangs of young Roma, including women and children, can regularly be seen harassing tourists. In 2011, France's then Interior . Minister said that the vast majority of street robberies in Paris were . being carried out by the children of Roma immigrants from Romania and . Bulgaria. Claude Gueant said . the notoriously poor and corrupt eastern European states were . responsible for exporting some of the most notorious sneak thieves in . the world. It has led to Romanian police arriving in Paris to support their French counterparts in clampdowns on the Roma. Officers dedicated to guarding tourists around attractions like the Louvre Museum from the immigrant gangs have increased. Intimidation, violence and theft increases in the summer months, as more tourists arrive for the groups of Roma to prey on. 'Everything . possible is being done to make the city a safer one, but many of the . Roma are young and have no papers, so dealing with them is almost . impossible,' said a local police source. Many of the Roma beggars who congregate around cash points and banks have very young children with them, including babies. Most of them live in large shanty towns on the outskirts of Paris, but more and more are setting up new camps in central parks and squares. Jean-Pierre Colombies, spokesman for the SNOP-SCSI police union, said Roma were constantly moving around Paris. 'It's musical chairs' said Mr Colombies. 'We chase the Roma from one place to another, from one arrondissement to the next.' Even Stephane Le Foll, spokesman for France's Socialist Government, appeared to back the police, saying that extremely poor communities living rough in Paris made 'everybody extremely nervous'. Mr Le Foll said: 'We're obliged to regulate all that, to be clear on all that, not to consider that nothing has happened.' Prime Minister Valls has continued a policy started by former president Nicolas Sarkozy of razing Roma camps, and trying to deport as many of their occupants as possible. This has led to protests from a number of human rights groups, including Amnesty International, which points out that most Roma in France are Romanian or Bulgarian and as such are EU citizens with the right to live and work in the country.","An aggressive gang of Roma sneak thieves surround a tourist and his wife .

"By . Peter Allen . Price of privacy: Actress Julie Gayet was only awarded £12,500 in damages from magazine Closer . The ‘secret’ mistress of Francois Hollande was today awarded the equivalent of just £12,500 after making a criminal complaint against the magazine which exposed their affair. Julie Gayet, 41, a high profile TV actress, originally asked judges sitting in Nanterre, Paris for more than £40,000 in damages from Closer magazine for breaching her privacy. The magazine made President Hollande a laughing stock in January when it published photographs of him leaving a Paris love nest on the back of a moped. He wore a crash helmet to try and disguise his face, but was identified by his shoes and the VIP bodyguards surrounding him. Mr Hollande took no action against Closer, but Ms Gayet was determined to take legal action. Jean Ennochi, Ms Gayet’s lawyer, said the images sparked ‘a real hunt’ for his client, who was pursued everywhere by photographers. But Delphine Pando, for Closer, said the magazine covered a security risk to the president which the public had a right to know about. She also pointed out that Valerie Trierweiler, the 49-year-old ex first lady, only learnt about the affair thanks to Closer. It prompted her to check into hospital for more than a week suffering from ‘stress’, and then she was effectively sacked by Mr Hollande. Ms Gayet filed a criminal complaint against Closer for ‘undermining the intimacy of private life’. As well as the £12,500, Ms Gayet wins a ‘condemnation’ against Closer which they will have to publish in their next edition. President Hollande's affair with Miss Gayet was revealed by Close in January this year when it published photographs of him leaving a Paris love nest on the back of a moped . President Hollande has allegedly been seeing more of his former partner, and mother of his four children, Segolene Royal pictured together before his presidency . Earlier this month, Closer ran another story which said it 'smells like the end’ for the Gayet-Hollande relationship. It said that Mr Hollande, who has never been married, is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with her. They have been meeting in secret for up to two years, Closer revealed, but now everybody knows. Now Mr Hollande is seeing more of Segolene Royal, the 60-year-old Socialist politician he dated for more than 20 years and had four children with. Closer pointed to how Mr Hollande is now ‘all smiles, and feels free since the clarification of his relationship with Valerie Trierweiler’. It noted how Ms Gayet has been promoting her career alone, attending the French Oscars, where she was nominated for a supporting actress award, and posing for photographs.","Julie Gayet had asked for £40,000 but was awarded less than half .

"By . Peter Allen . French police have called for the ‘systematic eviction’ of Roma from the centre of tourist Paris – provoking outrage from charity groups. It follows Manuel Valls, the country's new prime minister, saying that the travelling communities of mainly Romanians and Bulgarians ‘cannot integrate’ and should be deported. A strategy document written by police in the upmarket 6th arrondissement of Paris and leaked to Le Parisien newspaper calls for Roma families to be hunted ‘day and night’ and for their ‘systematic eviction’. Outrage: French police have called for the 'systematic eviction' of Roma from Paris' 6th arrondissement (stock image) It has drawn disturbing parallels with the kind of edicts issued by the Nazis during the Second World War Occupation of Paris. Gipsies were rounded up along with thousands of Jews and then sent to German concentration camps, where most were murdered. A spokesman for Charity group Catholic Help described the note as a ‘scandal’, saying that it ‘stigmatised a poor community’ and amounted to ‘racial profiling’. An official who works with the city’s police authority, also told Le Parisien that the note was ‘violent and illegal’. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, pictured left with President Hollande, said travelling communities, mainly Romanians and Bulgarians, 'cannot integrate' in French society and should be deported . He added: ‘This clumsy and unacceptable order stigmatises an entire group of people. What right do they have to purge them?’ But other Paris officials argue that Roma are behind a huge crime wave in the city, involving themselves in everything from aggressive begging to muggings and burglaries. Gangs of young Roma women, including children, can regularly be seen harassing tourists around landmarks such as Notre Dame Cathedral and the Eiffel Tower. Pierre Lecoq, mayor of the 6th arrondissement, defended the tone of the note, saying that Roma families living ‘on the street with young children’ was ‘not acceptable in human and social terms’. He said there had been a ‘massive influx’ of Roma over the past few months, leading to the ‘number of families to triple’. Solution: In the past, Roma and gipsy communities have been offered free travel out of France, such as here in Marseille in 2010 . Jean-Pierre Colombies, spokesman for the SNOP-SCSI police union, said Roma were constantly moving around Paris. ‘It’s musical chairs’ said Mr Colombies. ‘We chase the Roma from one place to another, from one arrondissement to the next.’ Even Stephane Le Foll, spokesman for France’s Socialist Government, appeared to back the police, saying that extremely poor communities living rough in Paris made ‘everybody extremely nervous’.

"By . Peter Allen . A French mayor caught speeding at almost twice the legal limit told police he trying to dry his car out after a visit to the car wash. Jean-Louis Hennon’s excuse is considered one of the most bizarre ever offered for breaking the law. After being caught by a flash gun doing more than 100mph in a 55mph zone, the mayor of Courcelles-Epayelles, in the Oise department of northern France, said he had just left a service station. Excuses: A French mayor caught driving at almost twice the speed limit told officers he was 'drying his car' (file picture) Mr Hennon said: ‘I’d been to the car wash and on the way back I may have accelerated for around a kilometre, no more, to dry the car out. 'It may seem strange a strange excuse but it is a sincere one.’ The incident is particularly embarrassing for Mr Hennon because it comes just a few days before municipal elections on Sunday, when he could lose his job. Today he was insisting that he was ‘not above the law’, while police were preparing to prosecute him for Saturday’s speeding. Mr Hennon said: ‘I drove a little fast for 1 kilometre, 1.5 kilometres maybe. Certainly I was going too fast. ‘Okay, well, I got caught by the police. I told them I agreed with them, that what I did was not very good, and that I made a mistake. 'I recognised my stupidity. I made a mistake and I won’t do it again.’ Mr Hennon was caught at 10.15am on the D138 road between Maignelay-Montigny, not far from Amiens in northern France, and Tricot. Police regularly highlight strange excuses people offered for speeding too fast on public roads. They range from drives saying they saw red and blue lights in their rear view mirror, to those who say they were engrossed in a conversation with a passenger so did not notice the speedometer. In 2008 a Muslim businessman from Falkirk, Stirlingshire, who was caught breaking the speed limit managed to keep his licence after saying he was ‘commuting’ between his two wives. In 1999, the then England footballer David Beckham successfully appealed against an eight-month driving ban for speeding in his Ferrari Maranello after he claimed he had been speeding to escape a chasing photographer. And, in the same year, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was found not guilty of illegally driving on a motorway hard shoulder after magistrates heard he had been suffering from severe diarrhoea and was trying to get to a toilet.","Jean-Louis Hennon caught doing more than 100mph in a 55mph zone .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . The Obamas' three day trip to Ireland last June cost the taxpayer more than $7.6million, it was revealed today. Michelle Obama spent more than $251,000 of taxpayers' money on a sightseeing jaunt to Dublin, Ireland while the first family was the official trip to Belfast, Northern Ireland. She stayed in the $3,300-per-night 'Princess Grace' presidential suite at Dublin's tony Shelbourne Hotel, a sumptuous two-bedroom, two-bathroom lodging that measures 1,530 square feet and includes butler service and its own dining room. President Obama an official visit to Belfast for a G-8 summit, and then to Berlin for official meetings, consuming 33.6 hours of Air Force One flight time. According to Air Force documents published Wednesday by Judicial Watch, the president's private Boeing 747 costs $228,288 per hour to operate, bringing the flight expenses for the trip to a whopping $7.67 million. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Swanky: The Princess Grace Suite at Dublin's Shelbourne hotel goes for $3,300 per night and comes with a butler . Michelle Obama and her daughters stayed in Dublin and racked up more than $251,000 in expenses -- at hotels like the Shelbourne -- while the president was attending a G-8 meeting in Belfast . Quasi-official pouting: The Obama daughters were unimpressed by Ireland's Wicklow Mountains National Park, but Secret Service were close by and accumulated expenses nonetheless . That doesn't include the cost of operating Air Force Two, which Mrs. Obama reportedly took to Dublin while the president was meeting foreign leaders in Belfast. Judicial Watch sued the federal government in January to get the records; it's best known for litigating Freedom Of Information Act requests and publishing the resulting documents. 'It is clear that the Obamas abused the perk of the president’s official trip to the G-8 summit for a luxury European vacation at taxpayer expense,' said Tom Fitton, the organization's president. 'And it is shameful that it took a federal lawsuit to obtain this information.  Transparency goes by the wayside for the Obamas when it comes to covering up their abuse of taxpayer resources.' The Obamas' earlier 2011 trip to Ireland cost an estimated $2.6 million, but the 2013 trip included the largest private security detail ever assembled in Northern Ireland. Secret Service agents and members of Mrs. Obama's entourage staying in Dublin for less than two days were lodged both the Shelbourne and the Westbury hotels. Rooms at the Shelbourne, including the first lady's presidential suite, cost just over $55,000. Lodging at the Westbury added more than another $70,000. Taxpayers ponied up more than $114,000 for rental cars during the brief stay, mostly for Secret Serivce details. The White House described the first lady's side trip as an official visit, but her itinerary with her daughters read like a sightseer's dream. Old-world charm: Mrs. Obama's entourage took rooms at the Shelbourne . The White House didn't say whether the first lady hoisted a Guinness, but she met the locals in Dublin over a pub lunch . While his wife and daughters toured the countryside and watched Riverdance, President Obama met with G-8 leaders before jetting to Berlin, where the rest of his family rejoined him . The Obamas' 2013 Ireland trip cost more than $7.9 million, including the first lady's Dublin sightseeing tour. Here is a breakdown of the expenses, according to Judicial Watch: . Air Force One: $7,670,476.80 . 'Security' in Dublin: $251,161.86, including: . 'The First Lady will visit Trinity College, Ireland’s oldest university, where she will explore archives documenting the Obamas’ Irish ancestry in the Old Library and view the Book of Kells,' read the White House's media preview of the journey. 'Later in the day, Mrs. Obama will meet with the staff and families of Embassy Dublin and join Irish youth for a special performance by the Riverdance company at the historic Gaiety Theatre. Sabina Higgins, the wife of the President of Ireland Michael Higgins, and Fionnuala Kenny, the wife of the Taoiseach, will also attend.' 'On June 18th, the First Lady will visit the Wicklow Mountains National Park.' During brief remarks to children at the Riverdance performance, she said one of her daughters described the Trinity College library as 'like Hogwarts ... It's a huge room with shelf after shelf full of books; a beautiful place, and I hope that all of you aspire to go there.' At the beginning of the speech, she erroneously thanked her host – 'Mrs. Kennedy' – before correcting herself. Michelle, Sasha and Malia Obama then flew from Dublin to Berlin, where they rejoined the president on the last leg of the short but expensive trip.","Michelle Obama and her daughters stayed in the 'Princess Grace' presidential suite at one of Dublin's fanciest hotels .

John Astley, 34, groomed the girl before taking her away from her home and raping her in a car park, Sussex Police said. Astley met  the girl twice in Sunderland before travelling from his home town of Bolton to West Sussex, and taking her to a retail park in Havant, Hampshire, where he raped her, a force spokesman said. As Astley drove her home late at night, the girl’s family discovered she was missing and called the police.

"By . Paul Donnelley . A familiar face in high-quality period dramas, actress Kristin Scott Thomas is not the obvious choice for a debate on violence in films. But following her decision to take on the role of matriarch Crystal in Only God Forgives, Scott Thomas yesterday revealed that even she was disturbed by the scenes of brutality in the film. And the Oscar-nominated star was further appalled that it was given a 12 rating in France – a decision she said was made purely to make money and that she would never allow her 12-year-old son to watch it. Scroll down for video . Scott Thomas is virtually unrecognisable in a long bleached-blonde wig, heavy make-up and fake nails in the new film Only God Forgives (above and below) The film, which was given an 18 rating by the British Board of Film Classification, is the Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn’s first since the 2011 thriller Drive . The film, which was given an 18 rating by the British Board of Film Classification and an R-rating in the United States, is the Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn’s first since the 2011 thriller Drive and sees Scott Thomas virtually unrecognisable in a long bleached-blonde wig, heavy make-up and fake nails. The mother-of-three whose youngest child is son George, 14, said that the viewing public in general have become more difficult to shock: ‘I found [the film] incredibly violent, and I was very disturbed by the fact that in France it was given the official seal of approval that any child over the age of 12 could see it. That was just the producer wanting to make more money, but it was irresponsible. There is no way my 12-year-old son would see that film. ‘I think [the level of violence in films] is disturbing. People should be more affected. I think people are getting more and more used to violence, violent images and sexual images. We’re so used to using the word “f**k” now.’ In her interview with Hunger magazine the 54-year-old said that she has seen first-hand how violent films can encourage violent behaviour in children: ‘I’ve seen with my own eyes that more than 20 minutes in front of a screen playing a game is very bad for children. 'It’s because they have this idea that they’re all powerful, and that they’re running the world when they’re playing this game, and they find it hard to relate to authority after that.

Scott Thomas rose to international fame in the Nineties with Bitter Moon and Four Weddings and a Funeral (above with Hugh Grant) Her role as Katharine Clifton, alongside Ralph Fiennes, in The English Patient in 1996 led to an Oscar nomination and she recently shared the screen with Fiennes once more in The Invisible Woman, playing the concerned mother of Charles Dickens’s teenage lover. She said she took the part of Crystal to push the boundaries once more: ‘You have to try new things because otherwise it just gets dull. That’s one of the reasons why I did Nick’s film because no one has ever asked me to do anything like that before. What I hate doing is repeating something I have already done. I want to be a bit dangerous, otherwise it’s not fun.’ A record number of films were rated 12A last year, raising concerns that more and more children are being exposed to scenes of violence and sex. In 2013, 321 films were given the classification, up by a third from 234 the previous year. The rating means children aged 12 and over can see a film unaccompanied - and those under 12 can view it if with an adult. It also emerged yesterday that Tom Cruise’s hit Jack Reacher, originally rated 12A, prompted the most complaints to the British Board of Film Classification last year. The ‘violent, dark and sadistic’ thriller, which sees a man shoot dead five people, had been cut to get it down to the 12A rating but still generated 26 complaints. Wolverine, The Impossible and About Time, other 12 and 12A films, generated protests about strong language and sexual references.","Film was given an 18 certificate in Britain and an R-rating in the US but 12 for French cinemas .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A disgraced barrister and part-time judge who lied to police investigating former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne's speeding points scandal has been removed from the judiciary. Constance Briscoe is currently serving a 16-month jail sentence for trying to pervert the course of justice over the investigation into how disgraced former MP Huhne passed speeding points to his then-wife Vicky Pryce a decade earlier. In a statement today, a spokesman for the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office said she had been removed from judicial office. Jailbird: Constance Briscoe is serving a 16-month jail sentence for trying to pervert the course of justice . He said: 'Miss Constance Briscoe, a Recorder and Fee-Paid Tribunal Judge of the First-Tier Health, Education and Social Care Chamber, has been removed from judicial office without further investigation by the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice following her conviction and sentence for perverting the course of justice. 'Miss Briscoe has not undertaken any judicial duties since her arrest on October 6 2012.' Briscoe was jailed for 16 months in May after being convicted of three counts of trying to pervert the course of justice. 'Lies': Constance Briscoe's mother denounced her daughter's book Ugly (left) as a pack of lies; Vicky Pryce (right) who took Huhne's speeding points on her way to prison . The 57-year-old, who was one of the first black women to sit as a judge in the UK, was jailed for twice the amount of time handed to Huhne and Pryce, after it emerged that she had helped economist Pryce, a friend and also her neighbour, to reveal information about Huhne's points-swapping to newspapers after the couple split in 2010. The court heard that Briscoe was intent on bringing about Mr Huhne's downfall and knew how to manipulate the criminal justice system to her advantage, misleading police in her witness statements and deliberately giving them an altered copy of one of her statements. Disgraced Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne was jailed for lying about a speeding offence . Jailing her, Mr Justice Baker told the mother of two that her conduct had struck 'at the heart of our much-cherished system of criminal justice'. After the verdict earlier this year Huhne, who was forced to resign over the speeding points scandal, released a statement in which he described Briscoe as a 'compulsive and self-publicising fantasist', declaring: 'British justice is likely to be a lot fairer with Briscoe behind bars.'","Constance Briscoe jailed for perverting the course of justice .

Ukraine has said that 45,000 Russian troops are on its border today and Nato has added that it thought that there was a 'high probability' that Moscow could intervene militarily in the east of the country where Kiev forces are closing in on pro-Russian separatists. Jose Manuel Barroso, the European Commission President, rang President Putin today to 'warn against any unilateral military actions in Ukraine, under any pretext, including humanitarian. Ukrainian government soldiers  rest at their positions in village Mariinka near Donetsk, eastern Ukraine . Practice: A Russian tank fires while performing at a military industrial exhibition in Zhukovsky,  Moscow. Western politicians fear these weapons could be used against the rebels . The Kremlin said that Moscow would send help to largely Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine. UN agencies say that more than 1,100 people have been killed including government forces, rebels and civilians in the four months since rebels seized territory in the east and Kiev launched its crackdown. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said that he was in favour of an aid mission as long as it was an international effort under the aegis of the Red Cross and involving the European Union as well as Russia. Mr Poroshenko said US President Barack Obama had also backed the international plan when they spoke on the telephone today. The International Committee of the Red Cross had no immediate comment, although last weekend it issued a statement acknowledging the receipt of an offer from Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov about aid convoys.

A Ukrainian soldier walks past a wrecked car used by pro-Russian militants who tried to break through the checkpoint of Ukrainian forces, near the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk today . The stakes have risen this past week as Kiev and Western countries claim that Russia is planning an invasion. Western countries say Mr Putin - who has whipped up the passions of Russians with a relentless nationalist campaign in state-controlled media since annexing Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in March - could invade to head off a humiliating rebel defeat. Kiev said it was in the 'final stages' of recapturing the eastern city of Donetsk - the main base of the separatist rebels - in a battle that could mark a turning point in the conflict.

'We see the Russians developing the narrative and the pretext for such an operation under the guise of a humanitarian operation, and we see a military build-up that could be used to conduct such illegal military operations in Ukraine,' he said. Nato believes that any Russian humanitarian mission would be used as a pretext to save the rebels, who are fighting for control of two provinces under the banner of 'New Russia', a term Putin has used for southern and eastern Ukraine, where mostly Russian is spoken. Ukraine appears to be pressing ahead with its offensive, undeterred by the presence of what Nato says are about 20,000 Russian troops massed on the nearby border for a potential ground invasion. Kiev put the size of the Russian forces much higher. 'As of 11 o'clock today, about 45,000 troops of the armed forces and internal forces of the Russian Federation are concentrated in border areas,' Ukrainian military spokesman Andriy Lysenko said. Artillery shelling knocked out power stations in the city and hit a high-security prison, killing one inmate and allowing more than 100 criminals to escape . He said they were supported by 160 tanks, 1,360 armoured vehicles, 390 artillery systems, up to 150 Grad missile launchers, 192 fighter aircraft and 137 attack helicopters. The leader of the rebels in Donetsk, Alexander Zakharchenko, a local man who took over the leadership from a Russian citizen last week, said that the fighters were considering mounting a counter attack against government forces in the next two or three days. Mr Lysenko said clashes took place in several parts of eastern Ukraine over the past 24 hours, with six Ukrainian service members killed and big losses to the rebel side. Rebel losses could not be independently confirmed. Municipal authorities in Donetsk said artillery shelling knocked out power stations in the city and hit a high-security prison, killing one inmate and allowing more than 100 criminals to escape.","EC President Barroso rang Mr Putin today to warn against unilateral military action .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A bakery has been ordered to pay more than £23,000 to a former worker after an employment tribunal found she had been sacked for becoming pregnant. Nicola McNamee, 24, took the sex discrimination case against Melting Moments bakery in Co Fermanagh after she was dismissed around a week after telling her employer she was going to have a baby. The company claimed that its decision to let Miss McNamee go last April, just two months after taking her on, was based on her conduct and performance. Scroll down for video . Nicola McNamee, with daughter Melissa Rose, was awarded £7,500 for injury to her feelings and £15,788 compensation for loss of earnings . But this contention was rejected by an industrial tribunal panel sitting in Belfast, which instead found the reason for dismissal was 'the fact of her pregnancy'. The panel also accepted a claim by Miss McNamee, who was supported in bringing the case by the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, that she was told at her initial job interview not to get pregnant or married in her first year in the job. Although an employee with less than 12 months’ continuous employment cannot usually bring a claim of unfair dismissal, this is not the case where the reason is related to pregnancy. Miss McNamee, who went on to give birth to daughter Melissa Rose, was awarded £7,500 for injury to her feelings and £15,788 compensation for loss of earnings. Nicola McNamee was only with the bakery for two months before she told them she was with child . 'I was delighted when I got the job and believed that it would be long term,' she said. 'I was told it would take about six months to get me up to speed with the job. Around the end of March I found out I was pregnant and I spoke to one of the owners at the start of April and told her about it. She suggested that I think about whether it was best for me to continue working or if I’d be better off leaving. I didn’t want to leave, I was happy to work and I was devastated when I was dismissed a week later. 'I am glad the tribunal has found in my favour and now I just want to get on with my life with my little daughter.' Although an employee with less than 12 months’ continuous employment cannot usually bring a claim of unfair dismissal, this is not the case where the reason is related to pregnancy as was the case with Nicola McNamee . Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner at the Equality Commission, said that the laws governing pregnancy and maternity issues in the workplace were essential to protect the rights and support the needs of women in the workplace. 'As a society, we need to ensure that women who become pregnant don’t lose their employment and that they can resume their careers after their maternity leave without discrimination,' he said. 'The Equality Commission still receives more complaints about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace than about any other form of gender discrimination. 'We also carry out a lot of work with employers, providing advice and guidance about the regulations governing pregnancy and maternity, work/life balance and flexible working. We find that most employers want to know what the law requires and how they can make sure they are providing fair treatment and equality for all their workers. 'Employers can find that offering flexible working arrangements opens up a wider pool of talent for posts and increases the commitment and loyalty of staff who benefit from it.'","Nicola McNamee, 24, sacked a week after telling Co Fermanagh bakery she was pregnant .

"By . Paul Donnelley . The biggest collection of First World War posrcards by prolific artist Donald McGill is going on display for the first time - on Monday, the anniversary of the start of the conflict. The artist is famous for his comic seaside postcards, but he also helped the war effort by producing an incredible 1,500 different designs of patriotic postcards. McGill, known as the King of the Seaside Postcard, portrayed British soldiers in a bad light early on in his career, with cards showing them drunk, stealing and seducing women. This McGill postcard features a wounded Tommy showing compassion to the Hun despite being at war . But after war broke out he showed full support for the soldiers and thousands of his cards were sold in England and France, with many even translated into French. ‘Donald lost his foot in a rugby accident so he couldn't partake in the fighting, but he did a big effort for the war by producing thousands of patriotic cards,’ said James Bissell-Thomas, the owner of the Donald McGill Postcard Museum in Ryde, Isle of Wight. ‘Most people have heard of him for his seaside postcards but, in fact, he has done much more than that. The Siegfriedstellung (Hindenburg Line) was a German defensive position of the First World War, built during the winter of 1916-1917 on the Western Front, from Arras to Laffaux, near Soissons on the Aisne . ‘As soon as the war began he started drawing cards and he produced 1,500 different designs, which is phenomenal and shows just how much they were in demand. ‘Many of the cards featured sentimental poems and would have been sent from soldiers to their loved ones. The cards show McGill is not just sauce and seaside, he did his own bit for the war.’ Postcard publishers and artists took the opportunity to increase sales during the First World War by commenting on both military and civilian events as they unfolded. Ooh saucy: A McGill postcard often had a double meaning . Beach boy: McGill could even get away with penis jokes . Two old men ogling a young lady but that's all they're doing. Age is against them... McGill’s cards show the men serving at the front as well as the realities facing their families at home. His designs cover issues such as rationing, home service, war profiteers, recruitment and soldiers in training. One postcard shows a soldier at an Army camp carrying buckets of food, with the caption: ‘What did YOU do in the Great War.’ A policeman gives information to a volunteer on the look out for the enemy. Note the wanted for murder poster of Kaiser Bill on the wall by the policeman . Entente cordiale: A British Tommy snuggles up to his French belle . Self-portrait the artist as an  old man: Donald McGill as seen by himself . Saucy seaside fun was the hallmark of McGill's humour like this image of a young swain teaching his belle to swim . Another card features two young children huddled under an umbrella with the slogan: ‘We’re prepared for Zeppelin raids.’ A soldier is seen cuddling a French woman in another card, which has the words: ‘England and France will always ""pull together"".’ Whilst a sailor is seen kissing a Scots soldier in a kilt in another of McGill’s humorous cards, which has the slogan: ‘I’ve sworn to kiss the first thing I meet in skirts when I come ashore.’ A soldier looks exhausted in another card which shows how busy army recruits are kept and is accompanied by the words ‘- and then we have the rest of the day to ourselves.’ McGill's humourous take on the British Tommy's day with a little patriotism thrown in . No nudity but McGill didn't always need to flash the flesh to make his point . Uncle Sam: Even though the Americans didn't enter the war until 1917 according to McGill the Yanks wanted the Germans to lose . McGill went to art school in London and began his professional career as a naval architect, then as an engineering draughtsman. But in 1904 at the age of 30 his postcard career kicked off by accident when he sent a cartoon to a nephew in hospital of a man up to his neck in a frozen pond. The caption read ‘Hope you get out!’ and was forwarded to a publisher who commissioned his work. Two war scenes from the pen of Donald McGill, both portraying Germany on the defeated side . McGill quickly became an expert in the art of the postcard double entendre and his designs were ingenious, twisted and often downright rude. He produced a massive 12,000 different seaside postcards throughout his career but in 1954 he was charged with publishing obscene images and four of his cards were banned immediately and 17 more banned once existing stocks had been sold. He died in 1962 at the age of 87.His career spanned seven decades, with his cards charting the changing times. Two adorable small children show that they may be young but they are prepared fro Kaiser Bill's onslaught . This jolly jack tar returns home to his sweetheart with tales of German seafaring cowardice . In honour of HMS Achilles: HMS Achilles was a Warrior-class armoured cruiser built for the Royal Navy. She served with the 2nd Cruiser Squadron for most of the First World War. The ship did not participate in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, but did sink the German raider Leopard in 1917 . McGill's postcards inspired those on the home front by showing the derring do of military men at home and abroad . Even Kaiser Bill has someone to love him - even if it is the devil in this cartoon by Donald McGill . Not so friendly - in this cartoon Kaiser Bill is compared to an irritating fly by Donald McGill . At the height of his fame McGill only earned three guineas a design, but today his postcards are highly sought after with his original artwork going for up to £1,700 in auction and up to £2,500 in London Galleries.","Donald McGill was better known for saucy seaside humour but turned his hand to the war at outbreak of hostilities .

The monsters that haunt children's nightmares have been bought vividly to life by an imaginative French photographer. The images show children battling giant, sharp-toothed creatures – but with a twist.

Armed with sticks, wands and swords the eight- and nine-year-olds gain the upper-hand against the villains.

Parisian photographer Laure Fauvel, 22, said: 'I wanted the children not to be victims and to fight the monsters. I wanted the monsters to fear the children.' Fauvel, who began the project in March, asked friends and family to pose for the shoot and used their own bedrooms to inject their personality into the photos. She then doctored images of real animals - such as rhinos and monkeys - to create the beasts. And she even drew from her own fear of spiders for one creepy creature. But the children showed no fear during the shoot. She added: 'I asked them to imagine a monster but because they're children it was just a game for them.'

"By . Paul Donnelley . A schoolboy has been left a ‘ticking time bomb’ after he developed a rare condition that affects just one in a million people. Callum McGilligan, 9, was a keen ice hockey player when he began suffering ‘funny spells’. The first diagnosis for Callum, of Longbenton, North Tyneside, was epilepsy. Callum McGilligan's life has been shattered with his diagnosis of alternating hemiplegia of childhood. Here he is with his parents Helen, 50, and Alex, 51 . But as the episodes continued, he underwent repeated scans and blood tests, the results of which left doctors baffled. Callum’s mother Helen McGilligan, 50, said: ‘They could come at any time, he is like he’s a ticking time bomb.’ It was when the family, including father Alex, 51, took Callum on a break in Wooler, Northumberland, that he suffered a major attack. The prognosis for nine-year-old Callum McGilligan (left with his mother) is not good. The right side of his brain has been damaged leaving him with the educational capabilities of a four-year-old . Mrs McGilligan said: ‘He looked as if he’d had a stroke. We called an ambulance straight away and he was taken to the Great North Children’s Hospital at the Royal Victoria Infirmary.’ It was there that Callum was finally diagnosed with Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood (AHC), a rare neurological disorder that can leave sufferers paralysed. The diagnosis has changed the boy’s life forever. Callum McGilligan was a keen ice hockey player until he began suffering what doctors initially diagnosed as epilepsy but was later found to be the very rare alternating hemiplegia of childhood . During Easter this year, Callum was hit by a massive attack which has damaged the right side of his brain. It has left him with the educational ability of a four or five-year-old, struggling to read or write . Alternating hemiplegia of Childhood is a condition that causes transient weakness of either, or both, sides of the body. The attacks may alternate or sometimes overlap, that is the second side is affected before the first recovers. Attacks start in the first eighteen months of life but the earliest episodes are often unusual irregular eye movements. The attacks last from less than an hour, which is unusual, to several days. AHC is caused by specific mutations in the gene ATP1A3. Affected children usually have significant . learning disabilities and motor organisational problems, including . unsteadiness. All children and young adults are different and have different triggers.  Some common ones are: . Water – bathing and swimming.Anxiety, excitement.Changes/extremes of temperatureBright lights and loud noisesFluorescent lights/Low energy bulbsStrong odours (e.g. perfumes)Childhood illnesses and infectionsTiredness and lack of sleep . Source: Alternating Hemiplegia of Childhood UK Support Group . Mrs McGilligan said: ‘Callum’s gone from a happy-go-lucky little boy into one completely dependent on us. ‘Living with AHC is like living with a time bomb, waiting for it to go off and not knowing how bad the damage will be.’ During Easter this year, Callum was hit by a massive attack which has damaged the right side of his brain. It has left him with the educational ability of a four or five-year-old, struggling to read or write.’ The latest episode has forced Callum’s removal from his local school , St Stephen’s Roman Catholic Primary, and his move into a special one. Calum has four elder siblings: Matthew, 30, Alexander, 18, and sisters Claire, 27, and Faye, 22. Helen added: ‘Our latest hospital visits show that Callum’s condition will probably not be cured. ‘He does take medication to control things as much as possible. ‘Callum had loved to play ice hockey. He played for a team in Whitley Bay. That was what he loved doing but he’s never been back on the ice.' The family hope that Callum’s story will help educate people about the shattering effects of AHC. They are also holding a charity day on August 10 at the Blue Flames Sporting Club in Longbenton.","Callum McGilligan of Longbenton, North Tyneside was a keen ice hockey player till he was struck down by rare condition .

Police have released shocking photographs of a woman knocked unconscious in an unprovoked assault. Sasha Jenkins, 28, was walking with a friend in Staple Hill, Bristol, at 12.45am on July 5, after leaving the White Swan pub in Downend. Two men walked towards the carer and one suddenly punched her to the ground as he passed. She was rushed to Southmead Hospital with severe facial injuries and later underwent a ‘painful’ operation. WDC Clare Chipping, of Avon and Somerset Police, said the ‘horrific’ pictures had been released in a bid to identify her attacker. ‘Sasha wants to release these photos of her before and after the attack to show the horrific nature of the injuries she suffered,’ WDC Chipping said. ‘She’s had to endure a painful operation and will need further treatment in the days and weeks ahead. ‘At the moment she’s taking time off from her job as a carer because she’s had to wear a protective mask as part of her treatment. ‘We don’t have a description of the two men who approached Sasha other than that they were young men. ‘We have carried out a number of inquiries already and now want to issue an appeal for anyone who witnessed this incident to come forward. Sasha Jenkins was hit with such force it broke her septum (left) and had to undergo a long operation (right) ‘I am convinced there will be people who know who is responsible and I would urge them to put aside any misguided loyalty and contact us.’ A 31-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and is on bail until August 24, she added. Miss Jenkins said the last thing she remembers is two men crossing the road towards her while she walked a friend towards a taxi rank. One of the yobs smashed his fist into the side of her face, instantly knocking her out so that she fell into the road. She woke up in a pool of blood after her attackers fled empty handed. The punch was so hard it has left the single mum-of-one with a half-centimetre hole in her septum and her nose was smashed into pieces. Her front tooth was knocked out and she had cuts and bruises all over her legs as well as a huge lump on her head. Speaking today, the support worker said: ‘We were just walking along and all I was thinking about was getting home to bed because I was tired. ‘The last thing I remember is these two guys walking towards us and crossing the road towards us. ‘The next thing I remember is the police asking me to sit on a step.

"By . Paul Donnelley . Children who are better readers or given educational games suffer less from Alzheimer's and other age-related memory loss, say researchers. A child intellectually stimulated throughout their life has better cognitive abilities in old age. The University of California study is the first to link childhood experiences to how they will be afflicted in later life. It found a child's socioeconomic status and literacy may have greater influence on the risk of cognitive impairment late in life than demographic factors such as race. An example of brain scan. The red colours are a warning of Alzheimer's Disease the green are a normal healthy brain . Professor of neurology Bruce Reed, the director of the Davis Alzheimer's Disease Centre said: 'Declining cognitive function in older adults is a major personal and public health concern. 'But not all people lose cognitive function, and understanding the remarkable variability in cognitive trajectories as people age is of critical importance for prevention, treatment and planning to promote successful cognitive ageing and minimise problems associated with cognitive decline.' The study published online in Neuropsychology looked at 300 Caucasian, African-American or Hispanic men and women aged cover 60 with no major psychiatric illnesses or life threatening medical conditions. Results found non-Latino Caucasians scored 20 to 25 per cent higher on tests of semantic memory - general knowledge - and 13 to 15 per cent higher on tests of executive functioning compared to the other ethnic groups. However, ethnic differences in executive functioning disappeared and differences in semantic memory were reduced by 20 to 30 per cent when group differences in childhood socio-economic status, adult literacy and extent of physical activity during adulthood were considered. Professor of neurology Dan Mungas said: 'This study is unusual in that it examines how many different life experiences affect cognitive decline in late life. 'It shows that variables like ethnicity and years of education that influence cognitive test scores in a single evaluation are not associated with rate of cognitive decline, but that specific life experiences like level of reading attainment and intellectually stimulating activities are predictive of the rate of late-life cognitive decline. 'This suggests that intellectual stimulation throughout the life span can reduce cognitive decline in old age.' The results found regardless of race, advanced age and apolipoprotein-E (APOE genotype) were associated with increased cognitive decline over an average of four years that participants were followed. If worried, people can now use the Early Alert Alzheimer's Home screening test. APOE is the largest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's. Yet less decline was experienced by people who reported more engagement in recreational activities in late life and who maintained their levels of activity engagement from middle age to old age. These findings suggested that early life experiences affect late-life cognition indirectly, through literacy and late-life recreational pursuits. Doctoral student Paul Brewster added: 'These findings are important because it challenges earlier research that suggests associations between race and ethnicity, particularly among Latinos, and an increased risk of late-life cognitive impairment and dementia. 'Our findings suggest that the influences of demographic factors on late-life cognition may be reflective of broader socioeconomic factors, such as educational opportunity and related differences in physical and mental activity across the life span.'","A child intellectually stimulated throughout their life has better cognitive abilities in old age .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A bungling burglar was caught thieving again after dropping his prison release papers during a break-in - on the day he was freed from jail. Andrew Graham, 31, burgled a hair salon in Leicester stealing £5,500 worth of equipment and hair products and two mini iPads. But he failed to get away with his when the salon owner found Graham’s prison papers, including his own photo, that the clownish con had left behind. Mental difficulties: Andrew Graham burgled a hair salon in Leicester on the day he was released from jail . The salon owner turned up to work the next day to find extensive flood damage and disruption, with a sound system and electrical items strewn over the floor. Thankfully his ID papers gave the police an instant lead and he was arrested two days later. Leicester Crown Court heard that Graham, a drug addict, had 74 offences on his criminal record, and 45 were theft-related. When arrested he also tested positive for opiates. And after pleading guilty to the salon burglary on June 25, and three other attempted burglaries on the same day, he was sent back to jail for 12 months. Just hours before the burglary at the Ungaro salon he had been released from jail for burgling two commercial properties and a theft. Alan Murphy, prosecuting, said: 'At the scene were Graham’s prison papers and other documents, including his photograph, which he may have dropped. The police had a lead straight away. 'Among the items taken were hairdryers, hair straighteners, scissors and accessories.' Graham burgled this salon in Leicester on the day he was released from prison . Sentencing, Judge Lynn Tayton QC said: 'You were released from your last sentence on June 25 and immediately started burgling again. 'The most serious burglary was of the hairdresser’s shop in the course of which a substantial amount of damage was caused. 'I’m told that having been released from prison you resorted to substance misuse and in some way you wanted to go back to prison because you couldn’t cope, which was why you left behind papers so it would be easy for the police to trace you. 'If you keep coming back before the court the sentences will only get longer.' During the hearing Graham also admitted a break-in at Lexington Packaging, in York Road, off Welford Road, which happened before his previous sentence, when more than £1,000 worth of property including a laptop, an MP3 player and clothing were stolen. His fingerprint was at the scene. James Bide-Thomas, mitigating, said Graham’s previous convictions were mainly for shoplifting and handling and he only began committing commercial burglaries in 2013. He said: 'He’s a man with mental health difficulties largely arising out of substance misuse. 'When he came out he wasn’t in a good place mentally and took solace in substances. The only explanation he gives for leaving details of his identity at the salon was he must have decided in his addled state that he wanted to go back to prison.'","Andrew Graham, 31, burgled a hair salon in Leicester stealing £5,500 worth of equipment and hair products and two mini iPads .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Two people have been arrested for conspiracy to commit female genital mutilation (FGM). A 72-year-old man was stopped by police at Heathrow Airport yesterday morning after arriving with an 11-year-old girl on a flight from Kampala, Uganda. Specialist officers took the girl - a UK national - into the care of social services. A 72-year-old man was arrested as he arrived at Heathrow from Kampala, Uganda with an 11-year-old girl . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Officers acted upon information given and a 40-year-old woman was arrested in Hackney under Section 2 of the FGM Act 2003, namely aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring a girl to carry out FGM on herself.' The man was arrested on suspicion of the same offence in Newham, east London,  today. Both suspects have been taken to east London police stations where they remain in custody. The police spokesman added: 'The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 makes it illegal to participate in any sort of arrangement for FGM to be performed on another, either inside or outside the UK.' The arrests come in the wake of news that militant group ISIS may have ordered compulsory FGM for all women and girls in a region of Iraq now under its control. The extremist group has seized large swathes of the troubled country's northern regions and is now said to be imposing its hardline Sharia rules on the population. The United Nations expressed deep concern yesterday at reports all girls and women in and around city of Mosul are to being forced to undergo FGM procedures. Mr Cameron speaks to campaigners against female genital mutilation at the Girl Summit 2014 in Walworth Academy, south London. At the one-day summit the government announced that parents will face prosecution if they fail to prevent their daughters suffering female genital mutilation . It also follows David Cameron's announcement this week that teachers and doctors will be under a legal duty to report if young girls in their care could be sent abroad and forced to marry under new rules. They could be struck off or disciplined if they fail to tell the authorities about children being spirited abroad and made to marry strangers, or if they ignore concerns a girl may be subject to female genital mutilation. Parents could be prosecuted if they fail to prevent their daughters being subjected to genital mutilation. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visit a school in Kampala, the city where the 11-year-old girl who arrived at Heathrow with the 72-year-old man came from . The Prime Minister said that schools had, in the past, been guilty of ‘turning a blind eye’ to the need to protect children at risk. And he said he wanted his daughters to be able to grow up in a world where the practice was outlawed. Mr Cameron made his comments at a major international conference in south London on combating forced marriage and female genital mutilation. He told the audience: ‘I am a dad with three children – two girls and a boy – and I want my girls to grow up with every opportunity that my son has, with no disadvantage, with the chance to make everything my girls can with their lives. ‘I've told you about my children. So my daughter – my eldest is 10; not that much younger than some of the children who get pushed into childhood or early marriage; not that much younger than girls who get cut and have their lives, in so many ways, taken away from them. ‘And this really is about the world that we want children like my daughter to grow up in. Is it going to be a world where we recognise that these practices are unacceptable, but instead of just saying that, instead of just signing declarations, instead of just passing laws, we actually commit to do everything we can, in our own countries and globally, to outlaw these practices forever.’ The Prime Minister – who had already passed a law making forced marriage a specific criminal offence, also said that he wanted schools to do more to warn and protect children from danger. Children are vulnerable in schools, he said, which ‘haven’t necessarily understood that these practices are going on and they have turned a blind eye.’ As well as the new rules for parents, teachers and doctors, victims of FGM will be given lifelong anonymity the moment an allegation is made. Mr Cameron told schools to stop being ‘coy’ about offending cultural sensitivities, and described how some girls were ‘disappearing off the school roll’ and ‘not coming back after the school holidays’. He added: ‘You read far too many stories about girls being taken on holiday to Turkey, to Pakistan and to India and not coming back and we need to get over that by advertising properly in schools.’ African country Somalia, whose capital Mogadishu is pictured, has one of the highest levels of FGM . Justice minister Simon Hughes said schools used to be nervous that challenging communities on issues of FGM or forced marriage amounted to “trespassing on a cultural space that was inappropriate” but that had changed in recent years. ‘It is no longer culturally embarrassing in this country challenge people’s beliefs and practices,’ he said. Unicef warned ahead of the summit that while the rate of FGM and child marriage has fallen over the past three decades, population increase in developing nations alone could reverse this trend if 'intensive action' is not introduced. It said its research showed that more than 130 million girls and women have experienced some form of FGM in the 29 countries in Africa and the Middle East where it is most common. In addition some 700 million women alive today worldwide were married as children, including more than a third - 250 million - who were married before the age of 15.","Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 makes it illegal to participate in any arrangement for FGM on another either inside or outside UK .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Two young hoodlums who resorted to murder as part of a ruthless plan to build a drugs empire in the heart of the Middle England commuter belt were each jailed for life yesterday. Charles Beadell and Ricky Jervis, both 22, begun a turf war to terrorise locals into joining their gang after they raked in around £30,000-a-month from peddling heroin and crack cocaine in the silk market town of Macclesfield in Cheshire. But when former football coach Zain Sailsman, 19, double crossed the pair and sold a shotgun which had been used in a gangland shooting, Beadell and Jervis lured the teenager to woodlands and stabbed him in the back as a 'punishment'. Murderers: Drug dealers Ricky Jervis (left) and Charles Beadell (right) arrive at Chester Crown Court . As the teenager staggered away dying from his wounds, Beadell who carried out the stabbing told Jervis: 'The kid thinks he can treat me like a muppet.' Keep-fit fanatic Sailsman who was nicknamed 'Black Magic' climbed over a fence and tried to flee up a country lane but collapsed. Passing motorists tried to help him but he never regained consciousness. It emerged the knife cut into the spine and severed a major blood vessel leading to his heart. Police investigating the murder later bugged a canal barge and secretly taped another local villain William Dale laughing about Beadell and the victim saying: 'Horrible little f***** that Charlie is. You know what I mean, cut his fingers off, cut his toes off, cut his ear off - anything but kill the guy.' Charles Beadell (left) was convicted of the murder of 19-year-old Zain Sailsman who a  post mortem examination revealed had died from a single stab wound . At Chester Crown Court, Beadell, from Macclesfield and Jervis, 22, from Congleton were both convicted of murder after a six-week trial and were each ordered to serve a minimum of 27 years. Zain Sailsman was a drug dealer who was murdered when he double-crossed other dealers . Jervis tried to spit at police but missed and soiled the glass of the dock. Beadell’s girlfriend Julia Howard, 36, a student forensic psychologist, who acted as the getaway driver was cleared of murder but convicted of perverting the course of justice and was jailed for three years. Dale, 25, was jailed for 14 years after he admitted drugs and firearms offences. Passing sentence the judge Mr Justice Robert Jay said: 'This case, as countless previous cases have done, highlights in cruel and graphic terms the grief, the misery, the human and social costs, of drug addiction and drug dealing. 'I have no doubt that the motive of both of you was to punish Zain Sailsman for what you felt was his cheeky attitude over time. 'You Beadell, knew that the gun had gone - you Jervis at the very least believed that it was highly likely that it had gone, and were of a mind to punish Zain Sailsman.' The jury was told Macclesfield’s drugs rackets had been orchestrated by Dale from his barge which was moored between Congleton and Alsagar. Dale was said to buy drugs in bulk and sell them on through a network of lower level dealers in towns across Cheshire and Staffordshire and would hire Beadell and Jervis. Charles Beadell was sentenced to life imprisonment with a recommendation he serves a minimum of 27 years for the murder of  19-year-old Zain Sailsman . But Beadell and Jervis wanted to take greater control of the Macclesfield drugs market after hoodlums from Manchester tried to move in on the area. Beadell himself was selling narcotics purely to make money for pure 'greed' and was turning over up to £1,000 a day on his own and would get his girlfriend to drive him around and was 'fuming' that outsiders were trying to grab his turf. He eventually recruited Sailsman a former youth team coach at non-league Macclesfield Town in Cheshire after exploiting the teenager’s drug habit. Sailsman who wanted free access to crack cocaine began selling drugs for Beadell and was eventually used as a hired gun to terrorise a rival small-time dealer. Last October Sailsman was driven to the home of their target where he used a 12 gauge shotgun to pump two bullets through the front door at point range - missing a couple and two children who were inside. Julia Howard arriving at Chester Crown Court to be sentenced for her part in the murder of Zain Sailsman . No one was injured but the rival who was not at home at the time was terrified enough to start working for Beadell. The gun was later hidden in woodland with the ammunition hidden in a churchyard but Sailsman dug up the weapon and secretly sold it to pay for his own drug use before fleeing to Blackpool. Beadell later contacted Sailsman’s mother Madeline Fletcher on Facebook saying people were coming to the house as her son had 'taken something' from him. Mrs Fletcher, 48, told the jury that she and her three daughters had already been threatened by her son’s criminal associates with her car and house being vandalised. The family home was turned into a ‘fortress’ with panic alarms and a fire- and bombproof letterbox. She said: 'I had told Zain there was consequences to his actions. It was the way I tried to bring my kids up. They threatened they would petrol bomb the house. I was living in fear.' Mrs Fletcher said she had been called by her son from Blackpool asking for money and added: 'He was crying, which wasn’t like him. He admitted carrying out the shooting with Charlie. I was shocked, especially as children were in the house. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t transfer money but said he would have to come back. 'I tried to make him see sense about the shooting. I couldn’t believe he could stoop so low. He said it was him who pulled the trigger. No one else had the bottle to do it. I told him to turn himself in.' Jailed: Julia Howard, 36, a student forensic psychologist, who acted as the getaway driver was cleared of murder but convicted of perverting the course of justice and was jailed for three years; William Dale, 25, was jailed for 14 years after he admitted drugs and firearms offences . Sailsman was brought back to Macclesfield by relatives and he tried to keep a low profile but paid with his life when he agreed to meet Beadell on the pretext of recovering the shotgun and to continue working for him. In a text exchange Sailsman asked Jervis: 'Not a set up or anything' and Jervis replied: 'What are you on? You’re one of the boys, I trust you.' Beadell, Jervis and Sailsman were later driven to the woods by Howard on October 30. Sailsman had planned to pretend to look for the gun by a tree then feign innocence when they could not find it - not knowing Beadell was armed with a 12-inch bladed knife. Jervis told the court: 'Zain was digging around for a couple of minutes with his hands. He looks a bit confused, gets up, looking and Charlie gets down and starts looking. 'How do you lose a shotgun? You don’t lose a shotgun. Someone said we should go back in the morning and look for it. Zain swore on his mother’s life that hadn’t been there or moved the gun but Charlie started raising his voice saying: ""You’re saying it’s me who took it"". Ricky Jervis was jailed for 27 years for murder . 'They carried on arguing and then Charlie lunged at Zain and came away screaming and shouting. Zain’s turned away from him and I saw the knife. He was moving the trees out the way. Charlie had the knife in his right hand. Zain ran towards the fence 'I said stop, man, stop! Zain said, ""What the f***? What’s he done that for?"" I didn’t realise how badly hurt he was. 'I said to Charlie ""What the f***, he’s supposed to be your guy, you just stabbed him."" I was shocked.’ Beadell and Howard fled Macclesfield and checked into various hotels but were arrested two days later. Jervis was arrested as he was fleeing into the countryside carrying a bag containing his clothes stained in the victim’s blood. All three denied murder. Beadell claimed Sailsman was stabbed by two drug dealers from Liverpool. In a statement after the case, Sailsman’s family said: 'Zain’s life has been cruelly and tragically cut short and regardless of the sentence imposed his murderers will one day walk free and be able to resume their lives. Zain will never get that opportunity. In our eyes no sentence will ever be long enough. 'Zain’s death has ripped the heart out of our family and our lives will never be the same without him in them. Zain was no angel in life but to us he was always the little boy with the cheeky smile and the big sense of humour. He did not deserve to die the way in which he did.'","Former football coach Zain Sailsman, 19, became dealer to fund his habit .

Carl Jefferies was playing near his home in Farnworth, Bolton, Lancashire when he lost the ball on a grassy area at the junction of Highfield Road and Tig Fold Road. As he went to retrieve it, an adder sank its fangs into his left leg.

Carl was taken to hospital after his ankle swelled up and he began feeling dizzy and being sick. Doctors kept the boy in overnight when they found venom in his leg reported The Bolton News. Carl’s mother, Kim Jefferies, said her son took a week away from school because he was unwell. Mrs Jefferies said: 'Carl was playing football with a neighbour when the ball went into some brambles. He went to get it out and the next thing he knew he felt a stabbing pain in his leg. The puncture marks caused by the snake's fangs in Carl Jefferies's leg can clearly be seen . 'The swelling became really bad and his leg started to turn purple,' said Mrs Jefferies . 'As soon as I saw it I knew it was an adder bite because I had heard of other similar incidents and it looked exactly the same. 'The swelling became really bad and his leg started to turn purple. 'The next day the bite marks became really inflamed and it started to turn green — I was worried sick.' The bite might have been worse but the snake produced only a little venom.

Mrs Jefferies said: 'I dread to think how much worse it could have been — as he has been constantly being sick all week, as well as suffering with stomach ache and headaches.' A snake expert commented: 'It is not a natural instinct for the snake to attack a human, unfortunately it looks like the lad has accidentally startled it when looking for the football and it has reacted in self-defence.' There have been a number of reported adder attacks in Bolton in recent years. Last summer a bearded collie dog died after it was bitten near Smithills Coaching House.","Carl Jefferies was playing near his home in Farnworth, Bolton, when he lost the ball .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Jobcentres should be split up, with their employment arms forced to compete against private sector and voluntary providers and the remaining services rebranded as Citizen Support, a think-tank has recommended. Under the plan, the employment services arm would be mutualised, while the remaining part of Jobcentre Plus would be expanded and renamed to reduce the 'stigma' attached to it. The right-of-centre Policy Exchange said just over a third (36 per cent) of people using jobcentres find sustained work, with many finding themselves in and out of employment largely due to having barriers to work which are not fully dealt with. The Policy Exchange think-tank report says that only 36 per cent of people who use a Jobcentre Plus find a regular job (File photo) The report said that the Government’s welfare reforms have improved matters, but there is still too much duplication and inefficiency in the system. The think-tank said private companies and charities should compete with government agencies to help people into work, with personal budgets for jobseekers to give them greater control over allocation of funding to employment support providers. Citizen Support would act as a central hub for government services, enabling advisers to identify an individual’s specific barriers to work and suggest providers that could help meet their needs. The adviser would also show the success rate of each provider using comparison data to help the jobseeker make a more informed decision. The report’s author, Guy Miscampbell, said: 'The way public services are currently structured means that often a jobseeker ends up being passed from pillar to post. This is confusing for the individual, creates barriers to help them into work and is expensive. 'Services have improved enormously, but there is still a lot more to do. 'What is needed is a radical overhaul of the system which puts the needs of the jobseeker first. The very word jobcentre comes with a stigma. The Department for Work and Pensions said Jobcentre Plus conducts 98,000 adviser interviews every day . 'Instead of attaching labels to people who are not in work we should reform the system to make it as easy as possible for individuals, who often have multiple problems, to work with an organisation that is best suited to helping them into work.' The Department for Work and Pensions said Jobcentre Plus conducts 98,000 adviser interviews, processes 18,000 working-age benefit claims and answers 197,100 calls in contact centres every working day. The 36 per cent figure was based on research from 2011, and the labour market has changed substantially since then, a spokesman from the Department of Work and Pensions said . A spokesman said: 'An important milestone has been reached in our country’s recovery. With one of the highest employment rates ever and more people in work than ever before, it’s clear that the Government’s long-term economic plan to help businesses create jobs and get people working again is the right one. 'However, we know there is always more to do, which is why our Jobcentre staff work hard every day to help people off benefits and into work. 'And our Work Programme - which is run by private providers who are paid by results - is helping more people than any programme before, with more than half a million people having started a job and 300,000 moved into lasting work.'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Do you know what #tbt means, or what #oitnb is referring to? If you don’t, Twitter is hoping to make things a little clearer with a new feature that has been spotted on its iOS app. The tool, first seen by Wall Street Journal, attempts to make popular hashtags easier to identify by decoding them automatically. Scroll down for video . According to screengrabs taken by Wall Street Journal, select hashtags now reveal the full term underneath. For example, #OITNB is labelled ‘Orange Is The New Black’ (pictured left) in reference to the Netflix show. Shortened terms, such as  #manutd, which stands for Manchester United, are labelled too . New York Magazine recently identified seven unique types of people who use hashtags. Hashtag Stuffers is the most common type of hashtag abuse, according to Wilser, . Stuffers add multiple hashtags to every post they write and even add tags into random words within the post. Verbal Hashtagger are the kind of people who use the word 'hashtag' in day-to-day conversations. Hashtag Stringers string multiple words together to form an extra long hashtag. Gratuitous Event Hashtaggers include people who go to events and then overuse the hashtag assigned to it. Hash Swaggers use event hashtags to brag about being at high-class or prestigious events. Hack-taggers are social network users that ambush the hashtags being used by companies, brands and politicians to protest. Crutch Hashtaggers use tags constantly, across multiple platforms, in a bid to be witty or . clarify the tone of a post. According to screengrabs taken by the New York-based site, select hashtags that feature acronyms now reveal the full term beneath. For example, #OITNB is labelled ‘Orange Is The New Black’ in reference to the Netflix show. This also includes common acronyms used regularly across social networks, such as #tbt for Throwback Thursday - referring to the day of the week users post old photos or make references to past events. Shortened terms are also explained, as seen in the WSJ examples, with #manutd being labelled with Manchester United. Although hashtags are used across social networks, they are synonymous with Twitter and have been criticised for being difficult to use or follow. Twitter even has a support page that explains what hashtags are, and how best to use them. As WSJ explained, however, not all hashtags are decoded and terms such as #MH17 – which refers to the Malaysian Airlines flight that crashed in Ukraine last month - are not explained. This also includes common acronyms used regularly across social networks, such as #tbt for Throwback Thursday - referring to the day of the week users post old photos or make references to past event (pictured) Although hashtags are used across social networks, they are synonymous with Twitter and have been criticised for being difficult to use. Twitter even has a support page (pictured) that explains what hashtags are, and how best to use them . Not all hashtags are decoded, and terms such as #MH17 (pictured) appear without explanation . People use the hashtag symbol # before a relevant keyword or phrase in tweet to categorise them, and help them appear more easily in Twitter Search. Clicking on a hashtagged word in any message shows all other tweets marked with that keyword, and is a good way to keep on top of breaking news, for example. Hashtags can occur anywhere in the tweet – at the beginning, middle, or end – and hashtagged words that become popular often become a Trending Topic. It is unclear whether the feature will be rolled out more widely, and whether it will also be used on Android and desktop versions of the site. Twitter, and other sites, often test features that aren’t implemented. For example, in March, users noticed the iconic retweet and quote tweets options had been replaced with ‘Share with followers’, and ‘First add comment’ buttons. These are yet to be rolled out to all users.","The feature was spotted by the Wall Street Journal on the iOS app .

"By . Paul Donnelley . It’s not the most popular sport in America but an Englishman is showing the Yanks the way when it comes to scoring in MLS (Major League Soccer). Dom Dwyer is the league’s second-leading scorer having hit the back of the net 14 times in 19 games for Sporting Kansas City. His 68 shots are the most in the league. It’s a long way from Cuckfield, the large village in West Sussex, where he was born and Norwich City, the East Anglian club he joined as an aspiring nine-year-old in 1999. Cup winner: Sporting Kansas City's Dom Dwyer celebrates his side's victory against Real Salt Lake in the MLS Cup Final . However, he never progressed to the first team and broke his foot four times. It seemed all over until he was offered the chance to move to America four years ago. He won two national championships at Tyler Junior College and in his second season he was named national junior college player of the year. Dwyer spent one season at South Florida in the first division before being signed by Sporting Kansas City and then immediately loaned out to Orlando City. Dom Dwyer attacks the Houston Dynamo goal in the MLS semi-final at Sporting Park in Kansas City, Kansas. Head the ball: Steven Caldwell (left)  of Toronto battles with Dom Dwyer at Sporting Park . In 13 games he netted 15 times, setting the league's single-season goal scoring record, before being recalled by his parent club. He now has his sights on Kansas City's season record goal tally, which stands at 18. It could be the start of an international career for Dyer as in 2017, the year before the next World Cup, he becomes eligible to apply for US citizenship. Dom Dwyer (left) protects the ball from D.C.

The trolleys were among a staggering four tons of junk that was pulled from a 200ft stretch of the Thames by a 50-strong team of volunteer students. Other bizarre items cleared from the river bed at Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey included 35 skateboards, 14 bikes, three prams, almost 400 bottles and four carpets. Scroll down for video . Shopping? A traffic cone, several bicycles as well as several trolleys are among the detritus pulled from the Thames after volunteers decided to clean up the river bed . The items were found by a team of 15 divers then pulled from the river using grapple hooks by volunteers on the riverside. They were then stacked onto a barge and towed away by the Environment Agency to be recycled. The project was run by Kingston University Sub Aqua Club and nearby dive centre Aquanaut Scuba and Snorkelling. Messy business: Four tons of junk was dredged from just a 200ft section of the Thames at Richmond by volunteers. The items were found by a team of 15 divers then pulled from the river using grapple hooks by volunteers on the riverside . The clean-up was first held in 2011 after being started by former Kingston University student and keen diver Chris Elliot. Last year’s event saw three tons of junk retrieved from the same stretch of river. Lynne Clafton, one of the coordinators of the clean-up, said: “This is the third year the river clean has taken place and it was the biggest and most successful yet.

"By . Paul Donnelley . It’s not the most popular sport in America but an Englishman is showing the Yanks the way when it comes to scoring in the Major League Soccer (MLS). Dom Dwyer is the league’s second-leading scorer having hit the back of the net 14 times in 19 games for Sporting Kansas City. His 68 shots are the most in the league. It’s a long way from Cuckfield, the large village in West Sussex, where he was born and Norwich City, the East Anglian club he joined as an aspiring nine-year-old in 1999. Cup winner: Sporting Kansas City's Dom Dwyer celebrates his side's victory against Real Salt Lake in the MLS Cup Final . However, he never progressed to the first team and broke his foot four times. It seemed all over until he was offered the chance to move to America four years ago. He won two national championships at Tyler Junior College and in his second season he was named national junior college player of the year. Dwyer spent one season at South Florida in the first division before being signed by Sporting Kansas City and then immediately loaned out to Orlando City.

In 13 games he netted 15 times, setting the league's single-season goal scoring record, before being recalled by his parent club. He now has his sights on Kansas City's season record goal tally, which stands at 18.

Allan Baldwin, of Lockerbie in Scotland said that from 2008 until 2013 he had extreme difficulty in walking and claimed the highest rate of Disability Living Allowance. Today at Preston Crown Court he was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and order to perform 200 hours of unpaid work.

Baldwin was a member of the Solway Morris Group and although is primary function was a musician, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) obtained footage showing that he also took part in the dancing.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The Tour De France may have encouraged hundreds of people to get out on their bikes, but whether you’re a professional or an amateur, no cyclist can escape the scourge of punctured tyres. Fed up with lengthy and expensive repairs, a team of bike enthusiasts developed a tool that fixes punctures permanently, in just 60 seconds. Called patchnride, the tool can also locate exactly where a puncture is using a so-called leak detector, and the whole system costs $25 (£15). Scroll down for video . The patchnride tool (pictured) was developed in Florida and works by fixing punctures using adhesive and a rubber seal. This takes less than 60 seconds and is said to be a permanent fix . Its designers claim this 'groundbreaking' method saves money and time as cyclists don't have to replace the tyre. When a cyclist suffers a damaged tyre, they locate the puncture using the patchnride leak detector. This tool causes bubbles to form at the site of the leak when the tool is inserted into the rim. After removing debris, such as a nail, pin or thorn, using one end of the tool, the cyclist pinches the tyre and inserts the other end into the puncture. Hitting the start button releases adhesive and pushes the slider on the tool forward so it inserts the patch into the tyre. After removing the tool, a rubber seal is left, which signals the repair is complete. Patchnride works on holes up to 0.1 inch (3mm) wide and is available for pre-order. It costs $25 (£15) and is expected to go on sale in September. Packs include two repair pods, two leak detectors and the tool itself. International shipping adds $5 (£3) to the cost. The lightweight patchnride, which weighs 0.2lbs (100g) and is five inches (12.7 cm) long, was designed by Austrian-born Alexander Deiser, although his company is based in Florida. When a cyclist suffers a damaged tyre, they locate the puncture using the patchnride leak detector. This tool causes bubbles to form at the site of the leak when the tool is inserted into the rim. After removing debris, such as a nail, pin or thorn, using one end of the tool, the cyclist pinches the tyre and inserts the other end into the puncture. Hitting the start button releases adhesive and pushes the slider on the tool forward so it inserts the patch into the tyre. After removing the tool, a rubber seal is left, which signals the repair is complete. Keen cyclist and co-founder of patchnride, Deiser, 47, said he gets 12 flat tyres a year. ‘Nothing deflates the joy of bike riding or ruins your race quicker than a flat tyre,’ explained Mr Deiser. ‘I had ridden 264 miles in a 12-hour race, was in the lead, and then suddenly I got a flat tyre. When a cyclist suffers a damaged tyre, they locate the puncture using the leak detector (pictured below the patchnride) . This tool causes bubbles to form at the site of the leak when the tool is inserted into the rim . After removing debris, such as a nail, pin or thorn, using one end of the tool, the cyclist pinches the tyre and inserts the other end into the puncture (pictured). Hitting the start button releases adhesive and pushes the slider on the tool forward so it inserts the patch into the tyre . ‘I lost the lead, and subsequently lost first place because I had to stop and change the tyre - it was incredibly frustrating. ‘This is what inspired me to look for a solution to permanently repair tyres on the go, no matter where you are and under any condition without being a sealant. ‘It has been really exciting, having created something that has never existed before and that solves a problem that many people encounter. ‘For the first time all inner tube tyres can be repaired permanently and effortlessly without the need to take off the wheel.’ Mr Deiser claims the tool cuts repair time from 10 minutes, on average, to 60 seconds and is the first product of its kind on the market. After removing the tool (pictured), a rubber seal is left inside the tyre, which signals the repair is complete. Patchnride works on holes up to 0.1 inch (3mm) wide and is available for pre-order. It costs $25 (£15) and is expected to go on sale in September . He added: ‘Although there are glues, gels, or sealants, none of these can permanently repair a tyre like our product can. ‘Since you no longer have to take the tyre off the wheel, it really saves on time and we think it is quite revolutionary. Patchnride works on holes up to 0.1 inch (3mm) wide and is available for pre-order.

Juan Carlos Yanez, 59, who stole bags from several airports was sentenced to three years in jail and also given a 10-year Asbo prohibiting him from Heathrow, City Airport, Gatwick, Luton and Stansted. Canadian national Yanez, of no fixed abode, had been arrested in Terminal 4 at Heathrow on June 5 following an investigation by officers from SO18, Scotland Yard's Aviation Security unit. Thief: . Juan Carlos Yanez, 59, a Canadian national, of no fixed abode was also given a 10-year Asbo prohibiting him from all London airports (Heathrow, City, Gatwick, Luton and Stansted) Yanez was a frequent visitor to Britain and would travel to Heathrow on express and tube trains, dressed casually and carrying a shoulder bag inside which he carried a change of clothes, hats and glasses so he could change his appearance to evade capture via CCTV cameras. He would identify departing passengers, mainly women, who were travelling alone and in possession of expensive designer bags. Yanez watched them until they were distracted by the check-in procedure at the counter, or using the self-check in terminals or if they were in the re-packing area due to excess baggage allowance. He would then steal their bags. An extensive review of CCTV was carried out and an image of the then unidentified Yanez was circulated around all British airports and across Europe. Juan Carlos Yanez targetted lone women like the lady in the picture (File photo) Authorities in Paris, France, identified him as Juan Carlos Yanez where he held a conviction for a similar offence. Yanez was then circulated as wanted by police at Heathrow. Yanez was spotted in Heathrow's Terminal 4 departures building on June 5 by Special Constables on duty with the Heathrow Bag Theft Team and arrested. He appeared in custody at Uxbridge Magistrates' Court the following day charged with eight counts of theft committed at Heathrow from August 14, 2012, to June 3 this year. Yanez pleaded guilty at Isleworth Crown Court on June 26 to six of the eight offences. Three further offences - two at Gatwick Airport and one at Stansted - were taken into consideration.","Juan Carlos Yanez, 59, stole bags from several airports was sentenced to three years in jail .

"By . Richard  Shears . A British man who went missing on honeymoon in Malaysia for two days after having a row with his new bride has been found today. Jonathan Kemp, 28, sparked a major police hunt on Friday when he walked out of the Kuala Lumpur hotel where he and his wife Alyson Jackson were staying. Officers are understood to be interviewing him about where he has been, for how long and what the row was about. Found: Jonathan Kemp, from Maryport, Cumbria, walked out of the Kuala Lumpur hotel where he and his wife Alyson Jackson were staying on their honeymoon . Jonathan Kemp, 28, and Alyson Jackson, 24, have only been married a week . Mrs Jackson, 24, said her husband was hallucinating at the time he disappeared. She has told The Star newspaper that they had an argument at around 11pm  after which he walked out. 'I tried contacting him on his cellphone but could not reach him,' she said. 'He was hallucinating before he walked out after a row. 'He didn't think he was in Kuala Lumpur. He thought he was back home in Maryport. I had to remind him where we were.' She said her husband, from Maryport, Cumbria, had been seeing people 'who were not there'. Mr Kemp, who has short, dark hair and had ginger-coloured stubble, was last seen wearing black pants and a white shirt with purple stripes. Appeal: Mr Kemp was found two days after he walked out of his honeymoon hotel . The couple were staying in the Bukit Bintang area of Kuala Lumpur, close to the city's buzzing entertainment centre . The couple had stayed the luxury Jumeriah Beach Hotel in Dubai before travelling on to Malaysia. They arrived at their hotel in the Bukit Bintang area of Kuala Lumpur just a day before his disappearance. Their hotel is located close to the city's buzzing entertainment centre, with its clubs and bars. Married for just a week, the couple were due to travel to Bali tomorrow. Last month the body of Briton Gareth Huntley, 34, from Cricklewood, London, was found at a turtle conservation resort in Malaysia. He disappeared during a trek to a waterfall on Tioman Island, off the south-eastern coast of the country's mainland. His body was discovered in a pond just yards from a kayak storage shed at the Juara Turtle Project where he had been volunteering, adjacent to a row of cabins used by rescue teams during the search. Mr Huntley, who is originally from the Leeds-Bradford border, was on a sabbatical from his job in the City.","Jonathan Kemp disappeared a day after arriving in Kuala Lumpur .

His paintings are to be removed from the school he once attended, his portraits are to be torn from the walls of official buildings and a commemorative plaque in the centre of Perth is to be torn up. While officials say the plans to ‘eliminate’ the convicted child predator from the West Australian places where he once enjoyed applause are yet to be officially approved, there is no doubt that they will go ahead. Scroll down for video . Eliminating memory: Officials in Perth, Western Australia, are planning to remove a commemorative plaque that was laid by Rolf Harris on a footpath . A portrait of Harris was removed from a council building in May and now the West Australian Education Department has confirmed that several Harris artworks are to be removed from the walls of Perth Modern School where he was a student from 1943 to 1947. A spokeswoman said the paintings would be taken down in coming days and would be ‘archived’. In addition to the school’s action, two local councils are considering what to do with monuments honouring ‘The Boy from Bassendean’. Lisa Scaffidi, Mayor of the City of Perth, said the council would most likely tear up a footpath plaque commemorating Harris on St Georges Terrace. ‘The general feeling around the place is that we don’t accept those kind of offences,’ she said. ‘It’s a very sad issue and something we need to deal with.’ When councillors in Bassendean meet on Thursday they will consider removing Harris’s status as a freeman of the town, as well as voting on whether to rip up a plaque near the entertainer’s former home. Removed: Artwork by Harris on display at his school, Perth Modern, will be taken down, officials have said . ‘My view, and what I will be urging the council, is to strip him of his Freemanship and also to remove all artworks that the town of Bassendean has displayed,’ said Mayor John Gangell. He told the PerthNow website: ‘The crimes in which he has been convicted are heinous and cannot be condoned, regardless of who he is or what he is. ‘It’s a sad day, obviously, and there will be a lot of shock in the community. There was always a possibility of this verdict, but nevertheless its a shock to hear the verdict.’ Mr Gangell said Harris had been ‘the hero of the town’, so his conviction came as a shock. ‘Unfortunately, that world stage that he’s put Bassendean on has now come crashing down.’","Lisa Scaffidi, the Mayor of Perth, said the city needed to 'deal' with the issue .

Kim Jong-un has rounded up the engineers and architects behind the deadly collapse of a North Korean apartment block and executed them by firing squad, it is claimed today. More than 500 people, including high-ranking intelligence and police officials, are thought to have died when the 23-storey building crumbled in the capital, Pyongyang. Kim, who was pictured touring a glass factory in photographs released today, was reportedly unable to sleep after learning of the tragedy last week, thought to have been caused by poor workmanship.

The Japanese newspaper said that although the exact cause of the accident remains unclear, shoddy construction is likely to be the cause because on-site directors and workers often smuggle away steel and cement to sell on the black market. Another Japanese newspaper, Yomiuri Shimbun, reported that the building was inhabited by top intelligence and police officials, which might account for Kim Jong-un's wrath. The building is also thought to have housed a large number of elite members of the Workers Party, and although it had not been finished, residents had started . moving in around late November because it is understood only some . interior work remained to be completed. At . least 92 households were believed to be living in . the apartment complex when it came down. Remorse: A construction division officer apologises to residents after the collapse of the tower block in Pyongyang . Location: A satellite photograph shows the building in the capital, Pyongyang, which is thought to have housed a large number of elite members of the Workers Party . Kim Jong-un has been known to order immediate death warrants against those who cause him serious grief, among them his uncle Jang Song-taek and members of his family, including children, it has been claimed by North Korean watchers. The leader started an aggressive construction drive in the capital in 2009, but the projects were plagued by a shortage of construction materials, according to the Yomiuri Shimbun. However, Kim pressed workers to continue building, including working hard and fast to complete a vast ski resort earlier this year in the Masik Pass in the eastern mountains. Photographs released by North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency today showed him inspecting the Taegwan Glass Factory in North Pyongan province. Last month, satellite photos showed that the roof of a luxury villa belonging to leader Kim Jong-Un had collapsed, also due to faulty construction.

An American satellite image expert said the building appeared to be an aquarium that was built in 2011. Kim Jong-Un had used material imported from Italy and Germany and had then filled it with £2 million worth of marine life including dolphins brought in from China. North Korean defectors said that military engineers were responsible for building Kim's person villas.

"By . Richard  Shears . Police are investigating a new lead in the baffling disappearance of flight MH370 - the possibility that the plane's huge cargo of exotic fruit could have contained a hidden explosive device. There was laughter at a press conference in Kuala Lumpur when officials revealed that the only cargo on the Boeing 777 jet was a four-ton consignment of mangosteens, a purple-skin tangy fruit with white segments inside that's popular in Asian countries. But we've now learned that police are trying to establish whether there was a deadly link to the seemingly harmless cargo ordered by companies in China. Mystery: Investigators are now looking into a possible theory that a bomb was hidden inside a crate of fruit on board MH370 . It has not escaped investigating officers that it would be easy to conceal explosive material inside a number of the thousands of pieces of fruit loaded in crates onto the aircraft. Malaysian Airlines CEO Mr Ahmad Jauhari Yahya, confirming that 'three to four tons' of mangosteens were on the aircraft, insisted that the cargo had been screened as a matter of routine. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak (centre) accompanied by acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein (left) and Department Civil Aviation Director General Azharuddin Abdul Rahman (right), address a press conference at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Several theories are being investigated, including that there was a bomb on board . But an intelligence source in Kuala Lumpur said today that it would not be difficult to 'bury' some kind of explosive material inside the fruit, particularly if it was in the centre of a crate. That explosive could then be set off electronically by someone on board the aircraft, prepared to die if the blast brought the jet down. The triggering device could have been hidden inside an innocent looking mobile phone, experts say. Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of a major catastrophic event causing the aircraft to suddenly soar up to 45,000ft, rendering everyone on board unconscious, particularly if a blast in the cargo hold had torn a hole in the side of the frame. A woman paints her palm with water colors during an event for passengers aboard a missing Malaysia Airlines plane, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Authorities now believe someone on board the Boeing 777 shut down part of the aircraft's messaging system about the same time the plane with 239 people on board disappeared from civilian radar . Out of control, it could have turned sharply westwards and continued flying straight out into the Indian Ocean until it ran out of fuel. 'This is yet another theory,' said a police officer. 'But we are not discounting anything.' Acting Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein has also said that nothing is being ruled out and that all theories and possibilities were being investigated. But he said that no official comment would be made on any information until it could be completely confirmed. All ground crew at the airport - 'anyone who has touched the aircraft', said Mr Ahmad - are under investigation as the probe into the jet's fate continued today. A man stands in front of a board with messages of hope and support for the passengers of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 at the departure hall of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport . The backgrounds of all passengers - most of whom were Chinese - are also being checked and double-checked.

Intelligence sources in Iran have told Malaysian investigators and Interpol that Pouria Nour Mohammad Merhdad, 19, and Delavar Seyed Mohammad Erza, 29, have no known links to terrorist groups. They are believed to have purchased the stolen passports in Kuala Lumpur, from where, investigators have established, asylum seekers using stolen EU passports have set out to fly to Europe.","Authorities are investigating whether a bomb was concealed in a crate of mangosteen fruit .

"By . Richard  Shears . Seven people are dead after a boy climbed into a well to retrieve a coin worth just 45 pence - and six others who tried to rescue him succumbed to oxygen starvation. The 11-year old who slid into the well on a bamboo pole in a village in the Banteay Srei district was the first to lapse into unconsciousness and die - and today the tragic series of events that led to their deaths was revealed by police. Acting district police chief Muy Nan told the Cambodia Daily that the tragedy began when 50-year-old father Tuy Chen accidentally dropped a 3,000 riel coin and his lighter into his well while drawing up water. Seven people are dead after a boy climbed into a well to retrieve a coin worth just 45 pence - and six others who tried to rescue him succumbed to oxygen starvation . Desperate to find the coin because of his poverty, he used the bamboo pole to slide down but while he recovered his lighter he did not find the coin which was too valuable to lose. 'The father was safe when he climbed back,' said Mr Nan. 'What no-one realised was that in the morning and night oxygen exists in the well, but there is none there in the evening when this occurred.' The police officer said that unaware of the air changes in the well, Mr Chen's 11-year-old son Che Aun descended down the pole in the early evening hoping to have better luck than his father in finding the coin. When he failed to surface, his two sisters, Che Kea, 13, and Che Ratana,15, went in after him, setting off a chain of doomed rescue attempts. Hay Chandy, 12, and his brother Hay Sangda, 20, went in after the sisters, followed by Chhem Sokhy, 15, and Teab Puon, 32, said the Cambodia Daily. Only the final person to descend, Soy Peam, 27, survived - but even he was rushed unconscious to hospital.. The incident happened late last night in a remote area of the north western province of Siem Reap (pictured) when an 11-year-old boy and six other people went into the well to collect 3,000 riel (45p) Police, who said the tragedy was played out in less than an hour, did not explain how the survivor was rescued. 'We tested the well by tying a chicken to a rope and lowering it down,' said commune police chief Phon Pheap. 'After a few minutes, the chicken was unconscioius. The people died because there was no oxygen in the well. Village chief Daung Check said the family of Mr Chen was extremely poor. 'They are so poor that they don't have enough rice to eat,' he said. Despite the death of three of his children, he and his wife will continue to struggle on with their remaining eight children, said the authorities. The bodies were brought up from the well by villagers using a rope. Police said the process took several hours as the rope had to be tied around the bodies one by one. Scientists have told the Phnom Penh Post that at oxygen levels between four and six per cent humans fall into a coma within 40 seconds, followed by convulsions and then death.  Above ground, oxygen levels are normally about 21 per cent. Che Chhan, a 30-year-old sister of the three siblings who died, blamed her family's poverty for the tragic series of events. 'My 11-year-old brother knew that my father had lost 3,000 riel in the well and he wanted to get it back without thinking it would be dangerous. And now so many people have died like this,' she told the Post. I wanted to blame my father because if he did not tell them about the money they would not have died But it's over now. They would not come back if I blamed my father. 'But the villagers blame my father and say he was careless.' The seven victims have been cremated in the village - and the well is to be destroyed.","Incident happened in remote area of north western province of Siem Reap .
