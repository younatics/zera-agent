A hiker has described the terrifying moment that he believed he would die alone at the bottom of an icy crevasse after plummeting 40 feet into a glacier and breaking his back. Ted Porter, 36, plunged 40-feet after losing his grip and sliding down a glacier on a solo hike in Montana's Glacier National Park last month. Mr Porter, from Los Angeles, was forced to record a message on his phone which he believed would be his last words to his parents. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Ted Porter, 36, survived a 40-foot fall down a glacier in Montana's Glacier National Park . Close call: Mr Porter, 36, (pictured with his girlfriend Jessica James Reynolds) managed to crawl out of an icy crevasse last month with a broken back. Doctors say he came within millimeters of being paralyzed . 'Mom and Dad, I fell in a crevasse,' he says breathlessly before wailing in pain. 'You guys if I don't make it out, I love you. I'm not kidding. This is no joke.' After recording the heartbreaking message, Mr Porter made the decision that he was not going to die alone in the wilderness. He told ABC: 'After I said that, I just had this urge. I was not going to die down there.' Despite having broken several vertebrae in his back, Mr Porter found the strength to claw his way out of the crevasse before trudging four miles in terrible pain to find help. He came across campers who cared for him through the night until he could be rescued by helicopter. Mr Porter, a voice-over artist from . LA, is an experienced climber and decided to set out alone on September 3 . during a week-long trip with his parents. He . was hiking across one of the park's largest glaciers when he realized . that he was in deep trouble as it began to rain and the ground . conditions grew slippery. Alone in the wilderness: Mr Porter took this image while he lay at the bottom of the crevasse believing that he was going to die . Terror: Mr Porter took this image on his cellphone while lying at the bottom of the 40-foot crevasse . No way back: Mr Porter is a seasoned hiker who found himself in danger in the Montana wilderness . Slow steps: Mr Porter has now left the Montana hospital and is recovering with his family in California . He failed to put on his crampons and ice sacks, a grievous error which almost cost him his life. He began to slide down the glacier and with horror noticed that a huge crevasse was opening up below. He plunged into the hole and landed deep below in the darkness. The 36-year-old pulled himself up the 40-foot drop using crampons and an ice axe. Mr Porter was emotional today when he thanked the campers who had helped him survive the night. However he brushed off his own bravery, saying: '...I just crawled out of a crevasse. It's not a big deal.' He has since had three surgeries and is currently undergoing rehabilitation while recovering with his family and girlfriend in California. Doctors say he came within millimeters of being paralyzed. A fund has been set up to help pay for his medical bills here.

Paul Bryant Jr., the president pro tem of the board of trustees and the son of legendary football coach Paul 'Bear' Bryant, said the school does not support the segregation . The story quoted at least one named sorority member and several other anonymous ones saying they wanted to invite the two African-American students to join, but were overridden.One of the board's trustees, former Alabama Supreme Court Justice John England Jr., confirmed his step-granddaughter was one of the African-American students passed over during recruitment in August. England said he was encouraged to see sorority members speaking out about what happened, but said he thought his ties to the university contributed to the attention the allegations are getting. One of England's sons, Democratic state Rep. Chris England, of Tuscaloosa, is the student's stepfather.England, now a circuit judge in Tuscaloosa, said the discussion differs from the university's segregationist past because of the willingness of sorority members to speak openly. 'We won't allow organisations to deny admission to individuals because of their race. We just won't permit that. Saying that is important,' England said.University President Judy Bonner said the administration was working with sorority chapters and their national organisations to remove any barriers.

The tribunal was told that Detective Constable Andrea Brown had been suffering from depression and was signed off . A detective on sick leave due to 'stress' and 'depression' for most of two years jetted off to the Caribbean when she was supposed to meet her bosses, a tribunal heard. Detective Constable Andrea Brown, from the Metropolitan Police, had been expected at a meeting to discuss her well-being after spending 18 months of the previous two years off sick but instead flew to Barbados that day for a family holiday, the hearing was told. The tribunal was told she’d been suffering depression and was signed off between June 2011 and April 2012. She returned to work, but has been signed off again since March this year. DC Brown claims she suffered a campaign of sexual harassment while working at Sutton CID in south London after her boss falsely bragged he’d had sex with her. She claims that the Met’s refusal to offer her a flexible work rota so she could look after her teenage daughter caused her 'severe work-related depression'. The tribunal heard that while working at Croydon CID, a senior colleague, now retired Det Insp Patrick Franklin, began making her feel ‘uncomfortable’. DC Brown said: 'I didn’t trust him. 'A male colleague told me that DI Franklin had been questioning him about our friendship and asked if there was something going on between us. 'He told him that our relationship was platonic and that we were just friends. 'DI Franklin told him that he was ‘tapping me’, which is street or black slang for having sex with somebody. 'This was an absolute lie and I was so angry that I decided to make a formal complaint.' DC Brown said she was then moved back to Sutton Police Station along with DI Franklin who she claims began making 'inappropriate' comments to her. She said: 'Sometimes he made me feel uncomfortable by making personal comments about my appearance and being a bit over familiar with me. 'On one occasion, I heard a voice say ‘looking fit girl’. When I turned round, DI Franklin was walking behind me. Detective Constable Andrea Brown had been expected at a meeting to discuss her well-being but instead flew to Barbados that day for a family holiday . 'There were other little comments like when he saw me eating fruit at my desk one day and asked what I was eating. I said ‘fruit’ and he said he’d noticed I’d put on some weight recently.' DC Brown was told she would have to 'substantially' increase the number of late shifts she was working from four days until seven days a week. She put a request in to change the rota because her daughter had 'lived out of a suitcase' as she had to stay with different people each evening. But her request was refused, leading to a complaint, and in April 2011 she discovered her father had cancer. She said: 'I was already feeling under tremendous pressure as a result of the refusal of my flexible work application and the news of my father’s diagnosis was devastating.' DC Brown said she was moved back to Sutton Police Station along with DI Franklin who she claims began making 'inappropriate' comments to her . DC Brown was still on sick leave when her father died, but she says her desk carried on 'bombarding' her with calls on the day of his funeral. She said: 'I felt totally wiped out as well as physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted.' DC Brown added: 'The thought of returning to Sutton made me so distressed that I suffered a relapse of my depressive illness and I was signed off sick with work-related stress by my GP from November 28th.' The next day, she was sent a letter from the Met stating they would be taking management action against her because of unsatisfactory attendance unless she returned on December 13th. She said: 'I got the impression they thought I was not really sick at all and just pretending to be stressed because I wasn’t getting my own way. 'They knew they were bullying me and causing me stress, but wanted me to stop complaining and get back to work.' Instead of returning to work though, she jetted off to Barbados with her mum and daughter - although she had not been granted leave. DC Brown said: 'This had been booked in August 2011. 'I felt the trip would assist my recuperation. I had not realised permission had to be obtained.' Deshpal Panesah, representing the Met, said: 'Without informing your line manager of your whereabouts, you flew to Barbados on the first day of leave and stayed there until after Christmas. 'There was due to a case conference meeting with you during that time and you didn’t attend. 'It was unauthorised leave and that is a professionally serious matter.' He added: 'You were not bullied, it was your perception of when you were being disagreed with. That is the reality. 'What you term as bullying is the normal management of an officer in their duty to fulfil their rota.' DC Brown is suing the Met, claiming indirect sex discrimination, disability discrimination, victimisation and a claim under part-time work regulations. The tribunal continues.","Detective Constable Andrea Brown had been expected at a meeting to discuss her well-being .

Like fellow designer-turned-activist Katharine Hamnett, Vivienne Westwood has never been afraid to reveal her political views in public. And so it was with her latest catwalk show which ultimately said more about her views on climate change (bad!) than it did about what we'll be wearing come next summer. Of course, there was an element of that - how could there not be - and what appeared turned out to be vintage Vivienne. Scroll down for video . Eco-friendly: Vivienne Westwood often uses clothes to make political statements, as in this instance . Modern classics: Underneath the hair and make-up was well-executed tailoring and pretty garden florals . The well-executed tailoring was present and correct, with a beautifully structured black pea coat revealing that Dame Vivienne's dab hand with the scissors has in no way diminished with age. Then there were shorts, in bright pumpkin orange and cool camel, that could easily be imagined into a holiday suitcase to be thrown on with a t-shirt or cosy knit. Dresses too boasted Westwood's trademark tailoring and came in the shape of office-friendly shifts and red carpet ready floral gowns. Another, a delicate baroque bandeau, was worn over a t-shirt loudly proclaiming the words 'Climate Change'. This is where Westwood began to come unstuck. Rather than drawing attention to her message - and it is a good one - it jarred with the delicate dress. Wearable: Despite the climate change message, Westwood offered up a positive vision for S/S14 . Starring role: Flame haired model Lily Cole was handed a central role in proceedings, which included a dance . Ethereal: Lily Cole's floating dance moves formed a central part of the show at London's German Gymnasium . Daywear: A neatly tailored navy shift dress . Accessories: Westwood's bags and boots were a highlight . Tailoring: A structured coat showed Westwood's talent . Then came Lily Cole. Cole, now a rare sight on the catwalk, returned to perform a bizarre dance at the behest of the designer. Twirling . and swooping in a flowing goddess gown, she looked like nothing so much . as a young Vivienne Westwood - made all the more plain when she . returned for an encore, bearing a bunch of blood red blooms for the . designer. But while the . designer's excellent tailoring and sympathetic message were enough to . earn her a bouquet, they didn't entirely work in sync. As . much political meeting as fashion show, Westwood brought two very . disparate worlds together. The result? At times, more theatrical than . stylish. Carmen Borgonovo of my-wardrobe.com added: 'Dame Vivienne conjured her mystical magic again with a collection full of off-kilter tailoring and curve enhancing dresses.'

A man's touch: The Butterball Turkey Talk Line has always had exclusively female operators, but that is about to change . Times are a-changing: In 1980s nine per cent Of callers were male. Now it is closer to twenty five per cent as men become more confident in the kitchen . Now, it's taking a more active approach. 'It's the perfect time, because we have seen more and more men involved in Thanksgiving dinner,' said Mary Clingman, director of the Butterball Turkey line. When the talk line started, only about 9 percent of calls that came in were from men. But now, about one in every four calls are from men, she says. Butterball, based in Garner, N.C., will offer an online application for men age 25 and up to apply to be the spokesman for the line or one of the operators, via its Facebook page. The spokesman, who will man the help line and offer turkey tips via media appearances, can be based anywhere but hotline operators should live near Chicago, where the hotline is operated . The online application will be available beginning Monday and close October 20th. Most operators have a background in food or nutrition and have culinary degrees or are dietitians, food stylists or scientists. They all take a crash course in turkey making at the Butterball University training program, as well. But the main requirement: 'You have to want to help people,' Clingman says. The talk line will be staffed during business hours in November and December, reaching up to 1 million turkey makers via all of its channels.","For the first time, Butterball is enlisting the help of men for its Turkey Talk cooking-advice .

An American has become the sixth wingsuit flyer to die in the Alps in as many months, it emerged today. The 33-year-old from California, who has not been named, plunged to earth near the French resort town of Chamonix on Saturday. His horrific death follows that of former British soldier Mark Sutton, who performed the James Bond stunt at the opening ceremony at the London Olympics last year. An American has become the sixth wingsuit flyer to die in the Alps in as many months. The 33-year-old from California, who has not been named, plunged to earth near the French resort town of Chamonix on Saturday . Like Mr Sutton, the American was wearing a wingsuit when he jumped from the top of a 2500 meter cliff near the summit of Brevent. He got into difficulties on the way down, and his lifeless body was later found by mountain rescuers. The accident has increased calls for the authorities to reinstate a ban on wingsuits – jumpsuits made of a special fabric which increase the surface area of the body, so allowing users ‘to fly’ after launching themselves from a mountainside or high building, or from a plane. The idea is that sportsmen can enjoy the feeling of flying before opening a parachute and landing. Mr Sutton, who was Daniel Craig’s double in the hugely popular Olympic stunt, died when he hit a ridge near the Swiss town of Martigny, Switzerland, close to the French border in August. His horrific death follows that of former British soldier Mark Sutton (pictured), who performed the James Bond stunt at the opening ceremony at the London Olympics last year . Last year Chamonix banned wingsuit jumps after the death of a Norwegian jumper, who died when his parachute failed to open. Mayor Eric Fournier said: ‘For us, adventure doesn't mean extreme risk. This is why the ban was brought in.’ It was lifted in July this year, however, following complaints from extreme sportsmen who argued that they were responsible for their own safety. ‘A new ban is a possibility,’ said a town council source. ‘The number of deaths associated with the sport is of great concern. Safety is always the priority.’","The 33-year-old from California has not been named after death on Saturday .

The staggering 2,073ft tall Shanghai Tower looms high above the forest of skyscrapers which makes up China's financial capital. But the astonishing rate of growth means Shanghai Tower might only hold onto its crown for a short time as plans for a mega skyscraper are already advanced. Head for heights: A journalist looks at the cityscape of downtown Shanghai from the top Shanghai Tower, which is undergoing construction, during the topping out ceremony . Journalists and photographers were invited to take in the stunning views from the top of the 125-storey building during a topping out ceremony today. The event was held to make the completion of the core structure when the last beam was installed. Shanghai Tower is located in the . Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone, an area of Shanghai that was farmland a . little over 20 years ago and has seen an explosion of construction of skyscrapers over the last decade. The area is China's first super-tall . district, as Shanghai Tower rises to complete a trio of towers including . the adjacent Jin Mao Tower and Shanghai World Financial Center.

Breathtaking: Shanghai's financial district of Pudong seems rather small when seen from the top of the 2,073ft Shanghai Tower, which is nearing completion . Designer Art Gensler said: 'Shanghai Tower represents a new way of defining and creating cities. 'By incorporating best practices in . sustainability and high-performance design, by weaving the building into . the urban fabric of Shanghai and drawing community life into the . building, Shanghai Tower redefines the role of tall buildings in . contemporary cities and raises the bar for the next generation of . super-highrises.' But a Chinese consortium has already expressed a desire to build the world's tallest tower - all 2,749ft of it. If construction of the planned . 220-storey 'Sky City', in Changsa, the provicincial capital of Hunan, . takes place, it would dwaft the current world's tallest building, the . 2,716ft tall Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

The project has been given the go-ahead in Changsa, but work has not yet begun. Shanghai Tower will house Class-A office space, retail, a luxury hotel and cultural venues. The uppermost floors will feature the . world's highest observation deck, while the tower's podium will offer a . high-end retail environment with a major event space. Below-grade . facilities include retail, connections to the Shanghai Metro and three . floors of parking. 'With the topping out of Shanghai .

Shanghai Tower Construction & Development Co., Ltd; Thornton . Tomasetti is the structural engineer; Cosentini Associates are the . mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineers; and the Architectural . Design and Research Institute of Tongji University is the Local Design . Institute. The development is slated for completion in 2014. Shanghai Tower is organized as nine . cylindrical buildings stacked one atop the other. The inner layer of the . double-skin fagade encloses the stacked buildings, while the exterior . facade creates the building envelope, which rotates 120 degrees as it . rises and gives Shanghai Tower its distinctive, curving appearance. The spaces between the two fagade . layers create nine atrium sky gardens. Much like plazas and civic . squares in traditional cities, the public sky atria offer spaces within . Shanghai Tower for interaction and community gathering space with . restaurants, cafis, coffee shops and convenience stores, as well as lush . landscaping throughout.

Shanghai Tower will have the world's . fastest lifts, with the Mitsubishi-designed, double-height cabs whisking . building occupants and visitors skyward at 40 mph using innovative . technologies designed specifically for the tower. Sustainability is at the core of . Shanghai Tower's design. The facade's taper, texture and asymmetry work . in partnership to reduce wind loads on the building by 24 percent, . offering a $58million savings in overall building materials. The building's transparent inner and outer skins admit maximum natural daylight, thereby reducing the need for electric light. The tower's outer skin also insulates the building, reducing energy use for heating and cooling. The tower's spiraling parapet collects rainwater, which is used for the tower's heating and air conditioning systems. Wind turbines located directly beneath the parapet generate on-site power for the upper floors of the building, with a 2,130kW natural gas-fired cogeneration system on site providing electricity and heat energy to the lower floors. Fully one third of the site will be green space with landscaping that cools the site. Overall, Shanghai Tower's sustainable strategies will reduce the building's carbon footprint by 34,000 metric tons per year; and the tower is targeting LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council and the China Green Building Three Star rating.","Shanghai Tower looms over super tall district of China's financial capital .

A fearless Afghan policewoman who put her life on the line for the job she 'loved' has been shot and killed in an ambush, two months after her female predecessor was also murdered. Sub-Inspector Negar, who like many Afghans uses only one . name, was killed when buying grass for her lambs outside her home in Lashkar Gah, Helmand . province on Sunday when two gunmen rode up on a motorbike and fired at . her. Her death, one of the latest in a string of attacks on prominent Afghan women, could make it even harder to recruit female officers in a deeply conservative nation where just one per cent of the police are women. Murdered: Relatives and colleagues sit beside the body of murdered Lieutenant Negar, a senior Afghan female police officer, during her funeral today in Helmand province . Negar, who told a New York Times reporter recently that she 'loved her job', even though she had recently been faced with the murders of two of her female colleagues. She told the NY Times, she saw it as her responsibility to raise morale among the 30 or so other female policewoman, according to BBC's David Loyn in Kabul. The courageous woman was 'a heroine by any account,' he said, and on more than one occasion put her life on the line for her job. He said she once went into a building and disarmed a sniper, and on another occasion she bear-hugged a suicide bomber to stop him from detonating. Negar's funeral was attended by colleagues and family members, many vowing revenge on the attackers. 'They have given us warning that one of us will be killed every three months and we will be killed one by one,' fellow policewoman Malalai said. The Taliban are believed to be behind many of the recent assaults on Afghan women. Negar was the top policewoman in Helmand, and worked in its criminal investigation department in Lashkar Gah city. Grief-stricken: A police officer comforts a relative of Lt Negar on the day of her funeral. Lt Negar is the second high-ranking female police officer in the local force to be murdered in as many months . Lt Negar was shot by unknown gunmen died from her injuries today. Two months ago, her predecessor Islam Bibi was gunned down in the same city . She had taken over the duties of Islam Bibi, a police officer shot dead in July by unknown gunmen. Ms Bibi said her own relatives had threatened her for having the job. Officials have given different ages for Negar, including 35 and 38, and varying accounts of her work history. But her son-in-law, Faizullah Khan, said she was 41 and had two children, a son and a daughter, and that she worked for the police in the early 1990s before the Taliban movement took over the country and banned women from jobs. Her son, police officer Hamid Khan, vowed to find her killers. 'I will serve my elders and people, my sisters and my brothers till the last drop of blood in my body. They should not believe that it is the end,' he said.

Negar's family has had several police officers, including her son, and a brother and her relatives had not objected to her work, the son-in-law said.

The mother of three was one of just a few dozen women working for the force in Helmand. She was responsible for training and recruiting women officers, as well as searching passengers at Lashkar Gah's airport. She . told the newspaper that she joined up because of her love for .

Many also face sexual harassment and assault by male . colleagues. And some are given menial tasks such as serving tea. Mrs Bibi had received death threats from her own family during her battle to forge a career in as an Afghan policewoman (file picture) In 2008, the county's most prominent policewoman was shot dead in similar circumstances. Malalai Kakar, 41, a mother of six, was leaving for work when she was shot in her car by two men on a motorbike, in the southern city of Kandahar. Her son, 18, was seriously wounded. Taliban rebels, who banned women from joining the police when they were in power, claimed responsibility. Mrs Kakar was the head of the department of crimes against women in the city and one of the country's most high-profile women.","Negar was shot dead by two gunmen on a motorbike close to her home .

Custody: Tameka Raymond, pictured in court last August, has re-launched her bid for full custody . Usher's ex-wife Tameka Raymond has filed for custody of their two children following Monday's pool accident which left their five-year-old Usher V in a coma. Tameka, who divorced the 34-year-old singer in November 2009, filed legal documents on Tuesday asking for an emergency hearing on grounds Usher is allegedly creating a 'dangerous environment' for the children. According to TMZ, the documents were filed in Fulton County, Georgia, and ask for the hearing to take place later this week. Tameka is seeking decision-making power over the children's education, healthcare, religion and extracurricular activities. She is allegedly claiming Usher is 'abdicating' his parental responsibilities by letting other people care for their two children,' report the website. She is also said to be doubtful of the people Usher leaves in charge of looking after the children - Usher Jr and four-year Naviyd. Apparently Usher's aunt - Rena Oden - was in charge of watching the youngster when his arm got stuck in the pool drain on Monday which led him to be rushed to intensive care, say TMZ. Tameka believes that Oden was 'not on the ball' when the incident occurred. In her documents, she also claims that Usher is '85% of the time out of town' and therefore delegates the care of the children to other people. According to Tameka, the singer's family members have been looking after her children because The Voice judge continues to fire nannies that were previously on staff. Usher currently has primary custody while Tameka has limited custodial rights after their split, but now she is seeking to reverse the situation. Usher Raymond V is currently being . treated in the ICU at an Atlanta, Georgia hospital after his arm got . caught in the drain of a pool at the star's home early Monday evening. The incident came just over a year on from the death of Tameka's stepson Kile following a jet ski crash. Scroll down for video . Hospital dash: Usher's son Usher Raymond V, five, was rushed to intensive care after a serious pool accident on Monday . The accident happened when the youngster was said to playing in the swimming pool with Usher's aunt Oden, according to TMZ. After spying a toy in the drain of the pool, he reportedly dove down to retrieve it but his arm got caught in the process. Seeing Usher Raymond V underwater, Rena immediately swam down to rescue the boy but to no avail. A maid also tried but failed to help . before two men working in the house were said to have rushed out and . dove into the pool, finally freeing the boy's arm from the drain. Usher Raymond V was then reportedly given CPR and rushed to hospital. His . famous father was not home at the time of the incident, but as soon as . he was notified, was said to have promptly rushed to his Atlanta . property. Happier times: Tameka and Usher, pictured back in 2007, two years before their divorce became finalised . He rode in the ambulance with his son and was later joined at the hospital by Tameka, TMZ reports. The little boy's state is currently described as 'okay' and doctors are reportedly running tests on him. Meanwhile, the frantic 911 call which Usher's aunt placed to emergency services has now been released and obtained by TMZ. During the call, Rena can be heard hysterically begging the operator for an ambulance. 'My . nephew was in the pool. He went and I couldn't get him. I tried to get . him. They did CPR on him,' she is heard saying in the audio. She is also heard trying to calm .

She then reports to the dispatcher that the youngster is in fact breathing after the CPR. 'Is he OK?' she asks the men. 'He's breathing', she is then heard telling the operator. Tragic: The incident comes after Usher's stepson Kile Glover,pictured here, tragically passed away at the age of 11 last year following a jet-ski accident . When the ambulance does arrive whilst . Rena is on the line, little Naviyd is heard saying that his brother is . 'faking it' to which Rena bluntly tells him: 'He is not faking it, come here.' The terrifying turn of events come . after Usher's 11-year-old stepson Kile Glover died over a year ago, two . weeks after he was critically injured in a boating accident. Kile passed away from the injuries he obtained after being run over on July 6, 2012 by a personal watercraft on Lake Lanier. The young boy, whose mother is Tameka, was taken off life support by doctors on July 21, who determined that he would not recover from his injuries. Kile was struck in the head during a jet ski collision while riding an inner tube on the lake in Atlanta, Georgia. Rights : Usher has custody of his two sons, Usher Raymond V and Naviyd Ely Raymond, after a custody battle with his ex-wife Tameka Raymond . According . to authorities, a family friend who was riding a jet ski behind the . pontoon lost control and collided with Glover's tube. Kile . was with an unidentified 15-year-old girl at the time of the accident . and both children were airlifted to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at . Egleston. He was later declared brain dead. In August last year, Usher was granted primary custody of his two paternal sons, Usher Raymond V and Naviyd, four, both of who he shares with Tameka. He had been locked in a custody battle with Tameka when Kile passed away. The . singer had been involved in a bitter dispute with his ex-wife over the . welfare of the boys, and a judge in Atlanta, Georgia, sided with the . star. The children spent the majority of time with their father, while Tameka retained some custodial rights. Heartbroken: Tameka tweeted this picture of Kile with his younger brother just before his death last year . Before the case closed, Usher's attorney labelled Tameka ‘incapable of being a proper parent’ to their children. He had accused Tameka of trying to interfere with the time he was allowed with their kids under their joint custody arrangement - a charge she denied. During closing arguments in the case, the legal representative said she ‘does not have the emotional stability or capacity to bond with them, and therefore she is handicapped’. Tameka's attorney, counter argued that Usher travels all the time and does not have a good relationship with his mother, whom he had testified was part of the family unit that would help take care of Usher V and Navyid when he was on the road.","Tameka accused her ex of raising their sons in a 'dangerous environment .

Just hours after the nation was rocked by news of a mass shooting in Washigton’s Navy Yard, a politician in Russia shocked them once more by mocking the tragedy before a death toll had even been tallied. Alexei Pushkov took to Twitter Monday morning and used Obama’s words from a speech on the Syria crisis to ridicule Americans in the wake of the tragedy in the capital. ‘A new shootout at Navy headquarters in Washington – a lone gunman and 7 corpses. Nobody’s even surprised anymore,’ Pushkov tweeted two hours after shots first rang out. ‘A clear confirmation of American exceptionalism.’ Thoughtless: Russian parliament member Alexei Pushkov mocked Monday's Navy Yard shooting as a 'clear indication of American exceptionalism' just hours after shots rang out in Washington . As the New York Post points out, . Pushkov, a member of the Russian parliament’s foreign affairs committee . was likely referencing a comment made by the president last week. ‘That’s . what makes us exceptional,’ Obama said. ‘With humility, but with . resolve, let us never lose sight of that essential truth.’ Obama was urging Americans to support a strike on Syria as a means of halting its human rights violations. But the Russian politician used the words to mock Americans. Twisting words: Last week, Obama called America's willingness to end human rights violations in Syria using military intervention 'what makes us exceptional' ‘The . USA should part with the notion of American exceptionalism,’ Pushkov . tweeted about an hour later. ‘It contradicts the principles of equal . rights and smells of political racism.’ This is not Pushkov’s first swipe at America, nor is it his first foray onto the international stage, though his timing and methods leave him more wide open for criticism than ever before. Pushkov, who is seen as especially close with the Kremlin, was among the most vocal in Russia during NSA leaker Edward Snowden’s prolonged stay at a Moscow airport. Snowden was eventually granted asylum in Russia, but not before Pushkov got in his jabs—at Snowden and America. Bad timing: Pushkev's comments came as the death toll was still rising from the Washington Navy Yard shooting he mocked. As of Monday afternoon, 12 people were counted among the dead . Pushkov at one point became annoyed with Snowden’s prolonged citizenship limbo. He joked that if Snowden does not find shelter in Venezuela, 'he will have to stay and marry Anna Chapman,' the redheaded Russian spy who was among 10 sleeper agents deported from the United States in 2010. At another point in the saga, reports mistakenly suggested Snowden has left Russia and the U.S. demanded to know his whereabouts. 'Why should the United States expect restraint and understanding from Russia,’ Pushkov mocked at the time. On Monday, Pushkov again showed no restraint when he used the occasion of a deadly shooting to make a political point. The death count at the Washington Navy Yard continued to rise after the Parliamentarian's comments. As of Monday afternoon, the death count was 12.","Alexei Pushkov ridiculed 'American exceptionalism' just hours after shots rang out at Washington's Navy Yard .

Powerful loss: Julia Gillard stepped down as Prime Minister after losing the Labor leadership . Former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has spoken for the first time about her ‘physical and emotional acute distress’ at losing her position of power. Ms Gillard, 51, was ousted as the leader of the country’s Labor party this June, forcing her to resign as prime minister. She describes the loss of her position as being ‘hit like a fist’ and says she grieves the loss of her political career. Writing for The Guardian Australia, she speaks of a pain ‘so strong you feel it in your guts, your nerve endings.’ She was ousted in a leadership challenge on June 26th this year which saw her predecessor Kevin Rudd re-take the position as leader of the party. ‘Losing power is felt physically, emotionally, in waves of sensation, in moments of acute distress,’ Ms Gillard writes, adding that since finding herself without a party and country to lead, she sometimes finds herself realising what it feels to be relaxed and not under constant strain. ‘I know now that there are the odd moments of relief as the stress ekes away and the hard weight that felt like it was sitting uncomfortably between your shoulder blades slips off. 'It actually takes you some time to work out what your neck and shoulders are supposed to feel like. ‘I know too that you can feel you are fine but then suddenly someone’s words of comfort, or finding a memento at the back of the cupboard as you pack up, or even cracking jokes about old times, can bring forth a pain that hits you like a fist, pain so strong you feel it in your guts, your nerve endings.’ Julia Gillard was born in Barry in Wales and her family immigrated to Australia when she was five years old. Following a double degree in Bachelor of Arts and Law from University of Melbourne she worked as a lawyer before entering politics for the Labor Party. Woman in charge: Julia Gillard became Australia's first female Prime Minister in 2010 when she took over from Kevin Rudd, who eventually took her seat this June . She became the first female Deputy Prime Minister in Australia's history in 2007 under Kevin Rudd, and took over as Prime Minister in 2010. Last week, just a few months after he took over from Ms Gillard, Mr Rudd led his party to a defeat in Australia’s federal election. After losing out to Conservative Tony Abbott he has stepped down as leader of the Labor Party. Julia Gillard made a promise when she was outvoted as head of Labor that she would retire from politics and is now expected to follow a similar route of ex British Prime Minister Tony Blair and enter into public speaking. In her open letter, she criticised Labor’s switch back to Rudd just weeks ahead of the election. She says saying it sent Australians 'a very cynical and shallow message' about the party's sense of purpose. After being re-instated as the leader of Labor this June, Kevin Rudd, left, was defeated in last weekend's election by Conservative Tony Abbot, right . She writes: 'It was not done because caucus now believed Kevin Rudd had the greater talent for governing. 'It was only done — indeed expressly done  - on the basis that Labor might do better at the election. 'Labor unambiguously sent a very clear message that it cared about nothing other than the prospects of survival of its members of parliament at the polls.' In addition, Ms Gillard writes, Mr Rudd failed to articulate a reason why he had been installed as leader, saying that he brought ‘not one truly original new idea to substitute as the lifeblood of the campaign.’ Following her promise to depart from politics, she praises her former colleagues, urging them to unite. ‘I know that my colleagues are feeling all this now. Those who lost, those who remain. We have some grieving to do together.'","Julia Gillard was ousted as leader of Australia's Labor Party in June .

A former military sniper has quit the U.S. army and moved to Britain where she lives as a woman with her lesbian lover. Former-squaddie Charles Pontiero, 40, is saving up for sex-change surgery after settling down in Coventry, West Midlands, with girlfriend Maria. After meeting student Maria, 29, online, Charles changed her name by deed poll to Alessia - and swapped a life in the army for a job as an actress. The blonde claims that she's finally decided to make the change and live openly as a woman in the UK because it's easier to change sex in Britain than the U.S. Alessia, who has married three times and has two teenage children, said: 'I always felt more like a girl than a boy, but I felt like I had to hide my female side when I was in the army. 'I didn't feel like I was really being myself. 'My family have a military background, so it felt like it was always the thing that I was going to do - but it wasn't right for me. 'My family have always known that I feel more woman than man, so there were no surprises when I told them that I wanted to live as a woman. 'They are all very supportive of me - and I'm finally happy now I've changed my name and found Maria. 'I've always wanted to change my name, but it was only when I moved to Britain that I realised how easy it is to change your name here - so I just decided to do it. 'That gave me the confidence to live as Alessia openly. 'I'm taking acting lessons now, so I hope to build a career as an actress.'

Then and now: Whitney was always happy with her adoptive parents (pictured on the left with her adoptive father Andy Brock), but she was curious about what happened to her biological family . On August 28 she decided to enlist the help of social media in her quest to track down her mom. She posted a picture of herself holding a sign with all the details she knew about her birth and her biological mother. She wrote what day she was born and at what hospital and that her mother's name was Jennifer Moorhead. Please share: On August 28, Whitney took to Facebook to spread the word about her search for her biological family . 'I knew I probably shouldn't get my hopes up, but I just couldn't help refreshing my page to see how many shares I was getting, or if any emails were coming through yet,' Whitney wrote on Facebook. The post was shared over 3,600 times and eventually a woman in Florida sent her a list of possible phone numbers for her biological mother. The next morning at 8am Whitney called the first number on the list and a woman answered. 'I said I know this sounds crazy, but is there any way you put a baby up for adoption in 1991. And she said, on February 6th? I said yes, and she said is this Whitney Brock? I said yes. She said hi Whitney. I'm your mother,' Whitney told 14 News.

It's the hottest ticket in town and only a selection of VIP guests will get to sit on the front row at Burberry's London Fashion Week show in Hyde Park this afternoon. But that doesn't mean you have to miss out on seeing the latest styles from the luxury British brand, as Femail will stream the action live from the catwalk. The live stream of the Prorsum Spring/Summer 14 collection will be available to watch below and on the MailOnline Femail channel as it unfolds at 2.30pm. This isn't the first time the British brand have harnessed the latest technology to stream their . show. Scroll down for video . In style: The Burberry trench was reinvented in an array of colours at the Spring/Summer 2013 show. See what's in store for 2014 by watching our live feed at 2.30pm . Earlier this year, MailOnline previously gave readers the chance to watch the Spring/Summer 13 show as it happened, watching models such as Cara Delevingne strutting down the catwalk in the season's heart motif clothes that have gone on to be sell-outs. This season's styles are expected to have as big an impact as Burberry's chief creative officer Christopher Bailey is famed for his ability to reinvent trends whilst still staying true to their more-than-a-century-old heritage. This has meant the brand's flagship trench coat has remained a wardrobe staple as Bailey has experimented with colours and fabrics to keep a traditional style looking fresh - and often imitated by High Street stores. Last season he gave us metallic trench coats in shades of the rainbow. Bright colours could remain a theme in this year's show as Bailey previously enthused about his love for them to the MailOnline: 'When you see colour, it changes the way you see the world. It makes people happy,' he said. Must-have: Heart designs featured featured heavily in February's show and many items went on to sell out . Join the fashion pack: Feel like you're on the front row with Andy Murray and Anna Wintour by watching our live stream . The brand was founded in 1856 but has moved with the times under Bailey. Their flagship Regent Street store in London is not just a place to shop but a hub of new technology with interactive mirrors, concert-quality sound systems and giant screens streaming their catwalk shows. They are also keen to engage with audiences around the world via social media platforms and to this end, for today's show from Hyde Park, they have joined forces with Apple to share pictures and video of the show on social networks using the new iphone5. Speaking to the MailOnline after last season's show, Bailey said it's all about involving people around the world and making them feel part of the experience - even if they can't be there in person. He said: 'It's about doing something that makes people smile, that makes people want to engage, whether it's online, whether it's physical, whether it's at the show like this.' Once again, the catwalk show will come from a specially-made venue in London's Hyde Park . The brand have also integrated themselves with the music scene, regularly staging live shows and discovering new talent. At February's show, the then unknown Tom O'Dell sang and played the piano on stage as the models took to the catwalk. He's since gone on to win a Brit Award and have a number one album including the hit songs Another Love and Hold Me. Music is expected to pay a part in this afternoon's show and while they may again go for a little known musician, you can bet they'll go on to follow in O'Dell's footsteps and become a star. In their most recent advertising campaign, Burberry teamed with These New Puritans frontman George Barnett and actress Suki Waterhouse to promote their Brit Rhythm men's fragrance with a rock and roll theme. Barnett and Waterhouse are likely to be front row guests today, and could perhaps bring their others halves Pixie Geldof and Bradley Cooper. Wimbledon champion Andy Murray and his girlfriend Kim Sears often never miss the show while Olympian Victoria Pendleton, singer Rita Ora and model-turned-actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley were among those on last season's start-studded front row.

From deepest, darkest Somerset, Alice Temperley is plotting to take over the fashion world. And if she's not, she should be after unveiling a collection that put London's wackier elements firmly in their place. Temperley made her name with bohemian flowing dresses and while the odd blast of boho still crops up, by and large, this was a romantically grown-up vision that will please urban girls and country ladies alike. Shimmering silk-organza gowns in cream and blush pink gave way to darkly dramatic dresses dressed up with fringed capes and festooned with neatly embroidered flowers. Scroll down for video . Taking over the world: This season, Alice Temperley offered up a seriously pretty collection of grown-up gowns . Write caption here . The flowers, a favoured motif of Temperley's, returned again and again, most successfully on a stunning hot pink gown, loose-fitting and crafted from a blend of delicate organza and silk. There was a dash of purple print too, on frocks that had more than a hint of Nicholas Ghesquière era Balenciaga about them, and a surprisingly successful attempt to combine loud leopard print with feminine florals. Florals reappeared again, this time as a delicate pale pink print blooming across a neat oat-coloured tea dress and once more on a show-stopping bias cut gown of the sort Alice Temperley does so well. Most of all though, the overwhelming impression was of pink, pink and more pink. Temperley had clearly taken inspiration from legendary Harpers Bazaar editor Diana Vreeland, who famously exhorted readers to 'think pink'. It certainly worked at Temperley. Temperley's offering was unabashedly pretty - and should make some of next summer's brides happy . Art: William Morris style blooms on the catwalk at Temperley . Purple reign: Blooms get a graphic makeover . Stunning: A gorgeous leopard print skirt on the runway . Show-stoppers: Temperley's trademark flowing gowns appeared embroidered with flowers in silk and organza . Despite the success of her trailing show . stoppers, Temperley hared off in a new direction with her shorter . offerings, which came with structured A-line skirts and nipped in . waists. Better still were her beautifully cut column gowns, a world away from the folksy efforts of earlier collections, which added a shot of 30s elegance to the collection. One narrow-skirted effort in a winning combination of rose, pale pink and black silk looked more Chanel than Temperley - and it was all to the credit of the designer. Best of all though, were the skirts. Temperley doesn't really do trousers but she does maxis like she means them and that was certainly the case here. Whether gently puffed animal print or inky ruched tulle, Temperley's were a tour de force.

Republicans John McCain and Lindsey Graham have condemned the deal brokered by the U.S. and Russia over Syria's chemical weapons, saying it is 'morally and strategically indefensible'. The members of the Senate Armed Services Committee warned the Obama administration was being led into a deal by Vladimir Putin and Syria's dictator, Bashar Assad. Their criticism came hours after the two countries announced a deal on how to neutralize Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. Scroll down for video . Critics: Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham say the deal with Russia is 'meaningless' 'It requires a willful suspension of disbelief to see this agreement as anything other than the start of a diplomatic blind alley,' the senators said in a joint statement, according to CNN. They went on to call the agreement, which requires Syria to produce an inventory of its weapons within a week, 'meaningless'. Assad's regime will also be required to allow international inspectors in before November, as part of a deal seen as a way to limit U.S. involvement in the bloody civil war. Senators McCain and Graham have pushed for a harder line over Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons, in an attack that killed more than 1,400 people on August 21. They have called on the U.S. to provide more arms to moderate opposition groups, adding 'this agreement does nothing to resolve . the real problem in Syria ... [Assad] can go on . slaughtering innocent civilians'. In the joint statement they said President Obama's weak response showed the U.S. was losing influence abroad, adding: 'We cannot imagine a worse signal to send to Iran as it continues its push for a nuclear weapon.' Agreement: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, shake hands yesterday after making a deal over Syria following three days of negotiations . US Secretary of State John Kerry, second right, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, back to camera, talk, with their senior aides seated by a swimming pool at a hotel in Geneva Switzerland . However, the chairman of the Armed . Services Committee has described the deal as being 'significant . progress' and said it could achieve a 'better outcome than the goals of the authorization approved just a few days ago'. Democratic . senator Carl Levin added that the deal still allowed for a military . response and that President Obama 'remains prepared to act'. Under the deal, announced on Saturday, Syria must hand over a complete list of its estimated 1,000 tons of chemical . weapons within a week, leading to their complete destruction in the . first half of 2014 in the deal agreed by US Secretary of State John . Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Assad . will be told to give full access to international weapons inspectors as . they search for stockpiles of deadly substances such as sarin – which . experts believe caused more than 1,400 deaths in an attack on Damascus . last month. Speaking in Geneva, Mr Kerry said: ‘There can be no games, no room for avoidance, or anything less than full compliance.’ Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the agreement and called on Russia to ensure the success of the deal. ‘The international community, including Russia, must hold the regime to account. 'The priority must now be a full and prompt implementation of the agreement,’ he said. Deadline: Assad, pictured, is thought to hold about 1,000 tons of chemical agents and precursors, details of which must be handed over by September 21 . Syrian opposition groups have also criticized the deal, calling it a stalling measure. General Salim Idriss, who is based in northern Syria, pledged to continue fighting Assad’s regime. The UK has been providing non-lethal aid to these groups including satellite phones, radios and body armour. The deal, secured after three days of negotiations, included an agreement of the extent of Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal. President Assad’s billionaire uncle was yesterday facing corruption charges in Paris relating to his property empire. Rifaat . al-Assad, 76, the ‘Butcher of Hama’ who allegedly ordered the massacre . of 25,000 people in 1982, has homes in France, Britain and Spain. He is . accused of embezzlement and money-laundering within an organised gang. According . to a complaint lodged by anti-corruption groups: ‘It is likely that . some or all of the assets of Rifaat al-Assad are the product of acts of . corruption.’ It estimated Assad holds about 1,000 tons of chemical agents and precursors. Details of these must be provided by September 21. Their removal will be supervised by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Teams . of UN and OPCW inspectors are expected to begin their searches in . November, with the Syrian regime responsible for their security.

He said: ‘Yes people might look at it going, “Yes it was letting off steam, it’s all understandable now, he was going off to Afghanistan”. 'Well, the papers knew that I was going out to Afghanistan anyway, so the way I was treated by them I don’t think is acceptable.’ Shortly after the pictures emerged the Apache pilot embarked on his second tour of Afghanistan, during which he later admitted he had killed Taliban insurgents, adding: 'Yeah, so lots of people have.'

She might be an 'ambassador' for the British Fashion Council but Samantha Cameron has been a rare sight at London Fashion Week so far. But it seems Britain's first lady of fashion is making up for lost time after she appeared front row at Christopher Kane and Erdem this morning. Mrs Cameron, who wore a black textured top from Swedish high street brand COS and a Jonathan Saunders skirt, is also expected to attend the Peter Pilotto show later today. Stylish: Mrs Cameron was seen in a COS top and Jonathan Saunders skirt at Erdem and Christopher Kane . Elegant: Samantha Cameron showed off her penchant for bright colours and was front row at Erdem and Kane . Minimal: Erdem offered an unusually muted vision for S/S14 with his trademark florals replaced with feathers . New direction: Although Erdem's ladylike silhouettes remained, he plumped for a monochrome palette . She was joined at the shows by Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who was composed and elegant in a burgundy check coat with grey fur tippets. Also at the show was Chanel stylist Caroline Sieber, socialite Alexa Chung and veteran model Laura Bailey. But while all eyes were on Samantha Cameron off the catwalk, on the runway, both Erdem and Christopher Kane were busy underlining exactly why he's worth a visit from Vogue. Erdem offered up a typically ladylike assortment of elegant shift dresses and clean tailoring but eschewed traditional florals, plumping instead for feathers. Unusually, colour was low on the Erdem agenda, with chic black and white dominating the subdued palette. Stunning: Christopher Kane's latest collection appeared on the catwalk at the Farmiloe Building in London . Vintage Kane: The latest collection from the British designer had ladylike touches and a real sense of humour . Sheer genius: Delicate spaghetti straps and neon panels . Stylised: Big sequinned lillies were the flower of choice . Pastels: Pistachio, blush and lavender dominated the palette . Kane, by contrast, offered up a colourful riot of pastels and print of the sort we'll all want to buy into come next summer. Highlights . included cleverly cut shifts with delicate leaf-shaped cutouts in . blush, pistachio and lavender, and a delicate white spaghetti-strapped . dress with sheer neon panels. In true Kane style, it was ladylike, sexed-up and boasting a very naughty sense of humour. Bold blooms, a summer staple, appeared on skirts, dresses and sweatshirts in the form of supersized, stylised lillies and orchids. It was all very much in line with what we've come to expect from Kane and while there weren't huge numbers of fresh ideas on show, you couldn't help but reflect that since Kane has clearly hit on a winning formula, he'd have to be mad to change it. Perfect prints: Kane's new collection featured plenty of print and some wonderful oversized blooms .

"By . Mark Howarth . PUBLISHED: . 20:05 EST, 15 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:47 EST, 16 September 2013 . Increasingly popular: The word 'sex' is now more common than it was in the Swinging Sixties . If the words we use every day reveal anything about our society, then gone are the days of handkerchiefs, handwriting, soup and suppers. Welcome instead to the new world of mortgages and movies, celebrity and sex. Researchers have ranked 2,500 of our most commonly used words  and compared them with the same list from 50 years ago. Linguists at the University of Lancaster used computers to trawl through millions of books, speeches, studies and newspaper articles currently in circulation. They found ‘marriage,’ ‘childhood,’ ‘God’ and ‘religion’ all fell in popularity but ‘Christmas’ was on the up. And although ‘modesty,’ ‘conscience’ and ‘gentleman’ are no longer in vogue, ‘sex’ and ‘celebrity’ are far more common. Project leader Dr Vaclav Brezina said: ‘We wanted to create a vocabulary baseline for the English language. ‘However, our list, when compared with the original one, reflects the changes in society over the past few decades; what we talk about and, particularly, write about. ‘What we have found is that there remains a fairly stable core of vocabulary but some words are no longer frequently used while others have become salient. ‘There’s greater use of informal terms – such as ‘guy’ - even since the early 1990s and, of course, sex is now publicly discussed far more often that it used to be. ‘It’s also really interesting to see old words develop new meanings as society and technology change. For example, ‘net’, ‘web’ and ‘user’ all now have computer-based connotations.’ The original GSL was published in 1953 to help foreign students learn English. Teacher and researcher Michael West collated what he believed to be the 2,000 most frequently used and relevant words in the language. The list was later extended to 2,284 entries in 1995 to incorporate derived words, such as ‘marriage’ from ‘marry’. Now the Lancaster University team has studied several giant collections of English texts totalling 12 billion words, all written over the past five decades and currently in circulation. Living in sin: Both 'God' and 'religion' as well as 'marriage' have dropped in popularity over the past 50 years . And the new GSL – published in the journal Applied Linguistics - has arrived at the 2,500 most commonly used. There is little difference at the head of the list with an identical top five of ‘the’, ‘be’, ‘of’, ‘and’ and ‘a’. However, elsewhere, there are telling changes in words’ positions in the list. Sex equality has left its mark with ‘man’ dropping 62 spots to 105th while ‘woman’ has risen 34 places to 198th. ‘Family’ may have risen 55 places to 216th but ‘husband’, ‘wife’, ‘marriage’ and ‘childhood’ are all big fallers. Also disappearing are words redolent of times past, such as ‘dear’, ‘servant’, ‘hunger’, ‘coal’, ‘mill’, ‘pencil’, ‘tin’, ‘bless’, ‘plough’, ‘handshake’, ‘telegraph’, ‘comb’, ‘grammar’ and ‘gaiety’. New to the GSL though are ‘mobile’, ‘internet’, ‘CD’, ‘guy’, ‘climate’, ‘video’, ‘technology’, ‘drug’, ‘text’, ‘online’, ‘computer’, ‘television’, ‘traffic’, ‘cancer’, ‘email’ and ‘environment’. ‘Good’ has been displaced as the most common adjective by the word ‘other’ while ‘same’ is also a sharp riser. Katherine Connor Martin, head of US dictionaries at Oxford University Press – which publishes the Oxford English Dictionary – welcomed the new GSL. She said: ‘There is often a tendency to regard language change in a negative light, as if each change is taking us further away from the original, real or correct way of using English. ‘But our language is constantly evolving and it always has been. Some changes are driven by social, cultural, and technological developments, but others have more elusive origins. ‘Change ensures that the work of lexicography is never done: new words are always being added and the usage and meanings of existing ones are always changing.’","Words such as 'sex', 'celebrity' and 'Christmas' all on the up since the 60s .

She's been described as a rottweiler, her partner's Achilles heel and has suffered unfavourable comparisons to her glamorous predecessor Carla Bruni. But although the media brickbats hurt, Valérie Trierweiler, partner of French President Francois Hollande, says she has no intention of doing things any way other than her own. But formidable though she is, Trierweiler, 48, revealed in an interview with the Sunday Times that becoming First Lady of France was a 'frightening' experience that took her months to overcome. 'It’s very frightening at the beginning,' she told the paper. 'It’s staggering. You have absolutely no idea of what awaits you, and at the same time absolutely everyone has their eyes on you. I was frightened of being observed, judged.' La Rottweiler: Despite the media brickbats, Valérie Trierweiler says she's far nicer than people realise . Controversy: President Hollande's former partner Ségolène Royal (left) said Trierweiler has a 'Rebecca complex' Since then, she's had to contend with the fallout from a very public spat with President Hollande's former wife, the socialist politician Ségolène Royal, and the publication of a succession of books, including one that alleged that she had an affair during her relationship with Hollande. Another, Between Two Fires by investigative journalist Anna Cabana, described her as 'a cocktail of jealousy, vengeance and political calculation' while in a third, The Favourite, she was dubbed 'not normal, snooty, infatuated, explosive, unpredictable and visibly dangerous' by journalist Laurent Greilsamer. Royal even went on record to say Trierweiler suffers from a 'Rebecca complex' - a reference to the Daphne du Maurier novel in which the protagonist is haunted by thoughts of her husband's first wife. So bad did things become, at one point, Trierweiler admits she contemplated never setting foot inside the Élysée Palace [the French No. 10] again. 'There was a moment when I didn’t come at all,' revealed Trierweiler, who lives with Hollande in a West Paris apartment. On duty: Trierweiler attending a White House summit with Michelle Obama and Japan's Hitomi Noda . Grand amour: Trierweiler shares a tender moment with François Hollande after his 2012 election victory . Predecessor: Trierweiler is a more low maintenance First Lady than Carla Bruni-Sarkozy . 'I could almost have never come back. Then, well, I got over all that and came back bit by bit.' A year on from the Ségolène Royal controversy, Trierweiler is concentrating on causes close to her heart - in particular those aimed at helping the women of the Democratic Republic of Congo where rape is endemic  - and finding ways to help underprivileged French children. Later this month, she will travel to Mali ahead of an official visit from President Hollande to promote local good causes and emphasise to the local population that dealings with France don't always have to come at the sharp end of a missile. She does all this, as she can't resist pointing out, with far fewer aides than her predecessor - and all while continuing to hold down a job as a journalist. One thing, though, hasn't changed. She is, she declares, as in love with her diminutive partner, as ever. 'What attracted me is [that] he has an enormous amount of charm and a lot of humour,' Trierweiler revealed. 'Above all, he has this vivacity, he’s more quick-witted than anyone I’ve known.' And what does she say to those who claim she's the formidable madame to Hollande's genial 'Monsieur Normal'? 'He isn’t the nice one people think,' she says, 'and I’m not the nasty one people think. He’s much harder than people imagine. He isn’t spineless.'","Valérie Trierweiler, 48, admitted that becoming First Lady was 'frightening'

Victoria Sujata, a grandniece of the late copper heiress, is the only one of Clark's 20 living relatives who is not suing her for a share in the massive estate - and could miss out on a small fortune. While her family fights a will that leaves millions to Clark's staff, Sujata has said that she believes the fight over the fortune is disrespectful to her late aunt, who died in May 2011, aged 104. 'I find the prospect of challenging my Aunt Huguette's will to be disrespectful of what could be her true wishes, an impolite act not in accordance with my values,' Sujata says in a new book about Clark, the New York Post reported. The book, Empty Mansions: The . Mysterious Life of Huguette Clark and the Spending of a Great American . Fortune by Bill Dedman and one of Clark's relatives Paul Clark Newell . Jr., lifts the lid on the fascinating family known for staying out of . the limelight. Sujata, a 66-year-old author of books about Tibetan texts, is quoted in the book under the name Clare Albert, her birth name. She . says she disagrees with her family's claims that Clark was mentally . ill, incompetent and coerced into signing away massive sums of money to . galleries and her staff in 2005. Gracious: Huguette was shy, but not sad. Her friends and the few relatives who knew her describe her as cheerful, gracious, stubborn, and devoted to her art. She poses at about age 37 . Family wealth: Clark, a copper, timber and railroad heiress, hugs her father on a vacation in Connecticut in 1912 . They are arguing over the validity of the will, which left $45 million to a philanthropic organization, $34 million to Clark's nurse and $1 million to her lawyer and accountant. Sujata's two siblings are among those fighting it. 'I do, in fact, believe that my aunt well understood how she was dividing up her wealth and that her final will represents her own intentions,' she said. Revealed: Sujata spoke in Empty Mansions, a book lifting the lid on the mysterious family . Still, Sujata has still hired a lawyer to watch over the trial. Jury selection in the trial begins on Tuesday. Of the 19 relatives now questioning the will, 14 . admit they never met their reclusive aunt. The heiress to a copper, timber and railroad fortune had no children and spent the last 20 years of her life living at Beth Israel Medical Center until she died in 2011 aged 104. The new biography offers tantalizing . details about the French-born heiress who was fixated on . life-like dolls and building miniature castles - often splashing out . thousands of dollars to make them. According to the Post, . one of the few people who visited Clark at her apartments in the 1950s . said that a long gallery was lined with dolls, each seated on its own . sumptuous armchair. One of Ms Clark's few outings was to attend Christian Dior fashion shows in order to find clothes to dress her dolls. The heiress was also obsessed with building miniature models. A . lover of Japanese culture, although she never traveled, Clark paid for . someone to travel to Japan to photograph and note the specifications of . the castles she wanted to build from the confines of her mansion. Estate: 19 relatives are now fighting for a share of the $300 million estate. Pictured, inside her Manhattan home .

Scientists discover that Sichuan peppers, a popular ingredient in China, contain a chemical that activates touch sensors in the mouth . For some people when it comes to spicy food, the hotter the better, yet for others the mouth numbness and tingling caused by eating chillies is just painful. But what causes this sensation and why does it vary from person to person? Previous theories found that chillis contain chemicals that activate hot and cold sensors in the mouth, yet new research from the University College London has discovered another chemical capable of activating the sensors that respond to touch. Called sanshool, it is found in Sichuan peppers and can access parts of the lips that connect to the area of the brain associated with touch. Although study co-author Nobuhiro Hagura, a cognitive neuroscientist at the university admits he is unsure exactly how or why it happens. Sichuan peppers, also known as zanthoxylum piperitum, are found predominantly in China and across the Himalayas. It is a common ingredient in spicy Chinese cooking and has a reputation for causing tingling lips and making the mouth feel numb. The authors compare this to the same feeling created by touching a live electrical current. Chillies are part of the capsicum family of plants that contain chemical compounds called capsaicinoids, such as menthol and, the most prevalent, capsaicin. When placed inside the mouth, these chemicals activate the parts of the tongue that can determine if food is hot or cold. The peppers from Sichuan additionally contain a chemical called sanshool, that activates touch sensors. During tests, Hagura placed Sichuan pepper powder onto the lips of 28 male participants. Each of the men reported numbing and tingling sensations. Powder from Sichuan peppers, pictured, was put onto the lips of participants. Their fingers were then vibrated and they were asked whether the tingling on their lips felt faster or slower than the vibrations. Researchers discovered Sichuan peppers created a feeling of 50 vibrations a second - the rate in which nerves sense touch . An American scientist claims that personality might determine whether you like spicy food. Pennsylvania . State University's research examined the link between peoples' personality types and whether they were fans of food packed full of hot . spices such as chilli. It found that people who seek adventure and intense sensations like spicy food more than those who avoid risky situations.

Mike Starr, a former bassist for the . grunge rock band Alice in Chains, was the first 'Celebrity Rehab' star . to die after his appearance on the show. Starr appeared on the show in 2009 in its third season. He admitted to being addicted to heroin, methadone, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana.

Following Wilson's death, she attended court-ordered rehab and her two sons were put into foster care, and they remained in the custody of the state at the time of her death. On her bio page from Celebrity Rehab's website, VH1 made references to her personal problems and even pegged the root of her troubles on her relationships.

A family who has fostered disabled children for three generations is facing homelessness after they signed up to a Government scheme to renovate their house so they could better care for their wards. Mark and Clair Waite received a £75,000 grant from Leicestershire County Council to transform their home into a respite centre for severely disabled foster children two years ago. But when the builder added a series of unforeseen costs to the bill the council withdrew its support leaving the couple to find the cash for themselves. Unable to meet the builder's . demands, he took them to court, leaving the Waites with a . total bill of £59,000, a sum they can only afford by selling their home. Despair: Mark and Clair Waite (pictured with children Joe, 10, and Charlie, 15) received a £75,000 grant from Leicestershire County Council to transform their home into a respite centre for severely disabled foster children two years ago . The couple, who represent the third generation in a 100-year family tradition of fostering disabled children, have had to sell all their furniture and clothes on ebay to pay solicitor's fees. They say the council has 'left them out in the cold' over the legal wrangle, leaving them responsible for the debt - which will almost certainly result in them ending up on the streets with their two children, Joe, 10, and Charlie, 15. 'I think we've actually come to terms now with the fact that we are going to lose our house and be on the streets with nothing but we don't know how we've ended up in this mess,' said Clair, 39, from their home, which remains unfinished. 'All we've . ever wanted to do is help disabled children, it's something my family - . from my parents to my grandparents - have always done and now we can't . even do that.' Before: The Waites wanted to renovate their home in Coalville, Leicestershire, so they could better care for the three disabled children they already cared for . Unfinished: When the builder added a series of unforeseen costs to the bill the council withdrew its support leaving the couple to find the cash for themselves. With the family unable to pay, the builder left the home unfinished . Mark, . 44,  who quit his job as a bricklayer in order to foster full-time, added: . 'I've been suicidal over all this. I've seriously considered driving my . car into a tree as at times it has seemed like the only way out.' The . Waites' problems began in 2010 when a social worker, admiring their . good work in fostering children with profound and challenging . disabilities, suggested they could be good candidates for a . Government-funded scheme designed to create better respite facilities . for disabled children. The . arrangement was that Clair and Mark, from Coalville, Leics., would . provide five years of respite care for disabled children in the area in . return for a £75,000 extension to their home. Mark . said: 'Clair had always fostered children from the age of about 19 and . her parents and her grandparents had always done it. I just liked it . because I got on with the kids and used to mess about with them and have . fun. History of care: The Waites come from a 100-year family tradition of fostering disabled children (Pictured: Clair's grandparents Elizabeth and Jack with Clair's mother Jackie, centre, and her aunt Jenny) Happy children: Clair's grandmother, Elizabeth . West, left, with a foster child. Clair's mother Jackie, also holding a . foster child, right, followed in her mother's footsteps . Now they have been landed with a bill . for around £50,000, plus £9,000 in legal fees to the adjudicator. In . June, they placed their home on the market for £250,000 in order to pay . the bills but every day the fees are mounting. 'Foster children . sometimes get treated like second class citizens, but the one thing . we've always made sure to do is to treat our foster children exactly the . same as we treat our own children'. 'We . exclusively fostered disabled children because that's what Clair's . family had always done and we felt they were the ones that needed the . most help. 'We had three foster children living . with us when we were approached about the short breaks scheme. It seemed . like a great opportunity because it was a guaranteed job for five years . and it meant I could work from home. We just jumped at it.' Under . the scheme, called Aiming High for Disabled Children (AHDC), the . building work was to include the addition of two extra bedrooms, . wheelchair access and a wet room with a hoist for lifting severely . disabled youngsters. Hole in the ground: The builder left the drainage unconnected and Mark had to finish much of the work himself . Aiming . High for Disabled Children launched in May 2007 and promised . £430-million to local councils for transforming disabled children's . services. AHDC is jointly delivered by the Department for Children, . Schools and Families and the Department of Health. However, . after the Waites' project was agreed with Leicestershire County Council, . the builder requested some extra work, totalling about £18,000, be . added to the bill. These . extras were negotiated and agreed by the Aiming High project manager . Owen London, but when the council failed to cough up the cash for the . extras, the builder, Mark Lupton of Sandaland Properties Ltd., turned to . the Waites to stump up the money. The . family then faced two adjudications, in which the county council funded . a barrister to represent them, racking up a legal bill of over . £13,000. But when Mr . Lupton initiated a third adjudication, demanding payment for a final . account of £47,000, the council withdrew all their legal support. One way out? Mark, who quit his job as a bricklayer in order to foster full-time, said he has felt suicidal over the ordeal . The . second adjudication was won, but the first and third - for which the . Waites had to shell out £12,000 of their own money - were lost. Now they have been landed with a bill . for around £50,000, plus £9,000 in legal fees to the adjudicator. In . June, they placed their home on the market for £250,000 in order to pay . the bills but every day the fees are mounting. The . family now face homelessness and bankruptcy and say the council is no . longer prepared to offer them any useful solution. Their only hope is to . take the builder to court, at a cost of £10,000, with money borrowed . from Clair's father, Pete. Meanwhile . the work on their home has not even been completed meaning there is . insufficient wheelchair access, no downstairs wetroom and no hoist. As a . result, the disabled children the scheme was designed to help are . missing out on valuable respite care, say the Waites. Mark . said: 'We have lost everything and now we feel we have nothing left to . lose by speaking out. No one wants to listen to us anymore, the council . won't even return our calls. In love: Clair's grandparents, Elizabeth and Jack West . 'It's been a horrible strain on the family. Clair and I have been arguing for the first time ever and our children have been so terrified that the bailiffs are going to come round that we have had to move out. 'We've not been able to do the job that we love and we've lost the three foster children we were caring for because the house is not ready for them to live in.' Leicestershire County Council has publicly stated that 'the Waites are refusing to work with us to resolve the issue', however the most recent piece of correspondence, dated September 27, states the couple has 21 days to respond to an offer - 'a full and final settlement' of £5,000 towards their legal fees - on condition that they sign a confidentiality agreement and drop complaints of bullying they have registered with the council. 'All we've . ever wanted to do is help disabled children, it's something my family - . from my parents to my grandparents - have always done and now we can't . even do that' - Clair Waite . Mark said: 'The offer is a joke. It would barely cover half of what we need to take the builder to court and who is to say there won't be more problems and more litigation further down the line?' Councillor Michael Wyatt has been supporting the family through their ordeal. He said: 'This family have been to hell and back, all because the county council are refusing to take responsibility for their actions. 'Even now, the family do not know if they are going to lose their home. I only hope this awful situation can be resolved as soon as possible.' A Leicestershire County Council spokesman said: 'From the outset, it's important to stress that we strongly refute the allegations made by the Waites and provide a wealth of support to our foster carers. 'We have paid in full for the cost of the adaptation, topped up the funding considerably and given the couple money for legal advice. 'In essence, this is a dispute between the couple and their builders and we have given considerably more money to the family than would have been reasonably expected. 'Like any council, we have to manage public money lawfully and can't offer unlimited funding but we sympathise with the couple's situation and would strongly encourage them to accept our offer of help.'","Mark and Clair Waite received a £75,000 grant from Leicestershire County Council to transform their home into a respite centre for disabled children .

An Illinois mother told she was not allowed to breastfeed in public at a local YMCA fought back against bungling staff and won. At the Two Rivers YMCA, in Moline IL, on Wednesday, a woman identified only as Nicole took a break from swimming with her family to breastfeed her 7 ½-month-old daughter only to be told by a male lifeguard to take it to the ladies bathroom, she instead took her story to local media and forced them to change their policy. After subsequent media attention raised by the woman’s fit, the facility set aside a separate nursing area the next day, they also apologized to the infuriated mother. Outraged: Nicole doesn't feel it's right for her to have to feed her toddler daughter in a bathroom . Nicole was approached by the lifeguard just as she was finishing feeding her daughter, she told WQAD. ‘You can’t do that here, but if you want to feed her you can go into the restroom over here and I will watch your kids for you,’ she told the station he said. ‘I thought, ‘I’m not going to take her into the bathroom and feed her, because I don’t even eat in the bathroom,’ she added. She subsequently asked if there was a law prohibiting her from breastfeeding public, which there isn’t in Illinois. Not against the law: Nicole contended the YMCA was violating her rights by forcing her into the bathroom . ‘Um, I think there is,’ the ham-fisted lifeguard shot back. Enraged, Nicole stormed off to find a supervisor to demand an explanation. After the higher-up asked if the baby was covered, Nicole explained the baby doesn’t like to be covered, but that she feeds her very discreetly. Nicole also noted this wasn’t the first time she breastfed her baby at the YMCA, and that she ‘never had anybody say anything to me so this was really awkward,’ she told the station. In the wrong: The Two Rivers YMCA has since apologized to Nicole and set up a separate breastfeeding area . The YMCA announced on Facebook that they had set aside a specific area for breast feeding that it felt was a fair compromise for all after the outraged mother told her story to local media. ‘We created a nursing area (not in a bathroom) that we thought was comfortable and appropriate,’ read the post. ‘Our policy will change as the law dictates, as, of course, we do not want to violate anyone's rights.’ The facility also apologized to Nicole for the incident, according to WQAD. This action was not enough for locals.

Complaining that society has ‘over-sexualized breasts,’ Ms Houk also mentioned multiple instances of persecution while breastfeeding her young son at a local mall. ‘My issue in the mall happened just a few stores down from Victoria’s Secret, where you have these monster sized breasts in the window, so it really is a double standard,’ she griped.

With sunbathers dressed in bikini tops enjoying the good weather and tourists punting down the river, it looked like a pleasant summer’s afternoon in Cambridge. But as those making the most of the heat wave relaxed at the water’s edge on Jesus Green yesterday, two people lay dead on the opposite river bank. As families and tourists sat in the park by the River Cam, the bodies of a man and woman were left on the sun-scorched grass covered by orange and white blankets. As families and tourists sat in the park by the River Cam, the bodies of a man and woman were left on the sun-scorched grass covered by orange and white blankets . Police sealed off the area with blue and white tape after the man and woman, said to be in her 40s,  were found collapsed shortly after midday. Two pairs of discarded shoes and empty alcohol bottles lay strewn on the grass beside them. The man and woman were declared dead at the scene and a second man was taken to the city’s Addenbrooke’s Hospital for treatment. It is believed all three had been drinking by the riverside as part of a group since the previous evening and had taken drugs, though it is not known what substance was involved. Police said there were early indications the deaths were drug-related but officers refused to rule out the searing 29C heat as a contributory factor. The deaths are not thought to be the result of overdoses. Detective Inspector Billy Bremner said: ‘We are aware that two people have died and a third was taken ill at about the same time. We are in the early stages of investigating these tragic deaths and are keeping an open mind as to the cause. Police sealed off the area with blue and white tape after the man and woman, said to be in her 40s, were found collapsed shortly after midday . ‘At this stage we can say that the three people involved are believed to have taken drugs in Cambridge shortly before becoming ill. We would urge anyone who has any information about the supply of drugs in the city to call police.’ One line of inquiry is that a contaminated batch of an illegal substance may be circulating in Cambridge, but the incident is not being linked to recent ecstasy-related deaths in Scotland. The deaths of seven young people in Scotland in the last two months are being linked to a batch of fake ecstasy tablets thought to contain toxic chemicals. An 18-year-old woman from Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, was the latest to die when she collapsed last Tuesday morning after taking a pill she believed was ecstasy. Police have warned that the suspect pills are green in colour and stamped with a Rolex crown logo, and that some have been found to contain the dangerous stimulant paramethoxyamphetamine, also known as PMA. The substance causes extremely high body temperatures, hallucinations and convulsions. Officers have also warned of a white pill with the Mitsubishi logo imprinted on it, found to contain the chemicals 5IT or AMT, and a yellow tablet with a star logo. Jesus Green, on the edge of the River Cam, is popular in summer with both residents and visitors. The river will this week play host to the Cambridgeshire Rowing Association Bumping Races. The event sees a number of crews racing at the same time on the narrow stretch of water. Rather than beginning side by side, the boats are lined up end to end, with one-and-a-half boat lengths (about 90ft) of clear water between them.","Bodies lay in the heat near the water’s edge on Jesus Green, Cambridge .

The latest episode of Game of Thrones shocked viewers with the brutal slaughter of multiple characters - but the creator of the series has insisted that the bloodbath was in fact based on historical events. Fans of the HBO series were horrified to see some of their favourites murdered at a wedding, and some have accused writer George R.R. Martin of going over the top with the extraordinary scenes. However Martin, author of the books on which the series is based, has revealed that the 'Red Wedding' was intended to reflect historical reality. It was based on two tragic moments in Scottish history when feasts turned into fights - one of which was the Black Dinner of 1440 at Edinburgh Castle, when the host killed his own guest after serving him with the ominous head of a black bull. Scroll down for video . Bad manners: The Black Dinner of 1440, shown in this archival rendering, saw the serving of a bull's head to the King of Scotland's dinner guest. A slaughter ensued . True story?: A still from the 'Red Wedding' episode of 'Game of Thrones.' The show's creator says the bloody scene came from historical fact . For diehard viewers of Game of Thrones, one of the most shocking elements of last Sunday's episode was seeing the 'hospitality laws' broken when the Frey family turned against their guests, the Starks. These laws state that once people have broken bread with one another, they are forbidden from harming each other - and this custom was not invented by Martin himself. ‘It was stolen from history,’ he said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. ‘Hospitality laws were real in Dark Ages society. A host and guest were . not allowed to harm each other even if they were enemies. By violating . that law, the phrase is, they “condemn themselves for all time.”’ 'Edinburgh Castle, toune and towre,God grant thou sink for sin!And that e'en for the black dinnerEarl Douglas gat therein.' The 'Red Wedding' scene in Game of Thrones, which even shows the slaughter of a pregnant queen, may seem to be a particularly violent example of this type of treachery, but Martin copied it from the medieval past. ‘The Red Wedding is based on a couple real events from Scottish history,’ Martin explained. At the Black Dinner, in November 1440, the 16-year-old Earl of Douglas was invited to Edinburgh Castle by Sir William Crichton, who as Chancellor of Scotland was a leading member of the court of 10-year-old King James II. Crichton feared the brothers Douglas and their allies were becoming too powerful. So he brought in the men to eat and drink until the king's men began ominously pounding drums. Shameful past: Unlike the Black Dinner, it was the guests who killed the hosts in 'The game of Thrones' Red Wedding. But the fictional and historical violence remains the same . Gory: The bloody scene of treachery shocked many fans . The head of a black bull or boar was served - a sign that death is near. The king's men then dragged the Earl and . his followers out of the castle into the courtyard. After a mock trial . that found them guilty of high treason, they were beheaded. Martin says he also based his equally loathed and beloved scene on another, more widely known instance of Middle Ages brutality. ‘The larger instance was the Glencoe Massacre,’ he explained, where one Scottish clan slaughtered another. New history: Edinburgh Castle was the site of a gruesome and treacherous slaughter that has now become part of popular culture via 'Game of Thrones' Half crazy: But George R.R. Martin says the carnage came from Scottish history, not just his imagination . As The Week tells it, the MacDonalds . had until a prescribed date to swear allegiance to the new king, William . of Orange. But the letter they sent to do so, due to bureaucratic . mishandling and a secretary of state who had a bone to pick against . the clan, didn't make it in time. The Campbells, under the command of Captain Robert Campbell visited the MacDonalds at Glencoe in 1692. Clan Campbell, Martin explained, stayed with Clan MacDonald, so the laws of hospitality were supposed to apply but were quickly - and murderously - ignored. The clans played cards together and . then the MacDonalds fell asleep. As they dozed, the vengeful Campbells . killed 38 of them in their beds. Some 40 women and children escaped, . only to perish in the blizzard that raged that night. Though . Martin has said the ‘Red Wedding’ scene lost him a great many readers . and that even he had trouble watching it in television form, he has defended the bloodshed by insisting that he is only reflected the dark side of human nature, as recorded throughout history. ‘No matter how much I make up,’ he said, ‘there’s stuff in history that’s just as bad, or worse.’","TV viewers shocked by horrific slaughter in latest episode of fantasy series .

Studies of the skeleton have shown that Fortune suffered from a fractured left hand, a severely sprained ankle and lower back pain (stock image) The bones of a slave known as Mr Fortune will be laid to rest today 215 years after his death. Fortune's skeleton will lie in state in the Capitol rotunda in Hartford before it is taken to the church in Waterbury where he was baptised for a service. He will be buried in a nearby cemetery with other prominent figures to the sound of bagpipes and 'The Battle Hymn of the Republic'. Steven R. Mullins, one of the organizers, said: 'It's a long overdue honor. We're not just remembering one man. His body is representing all of the slaves that came over here and worked in this country.' Fortune was owned by Dr Preserved Porter on a farm in Waterbury, Connecticut, and died of a suspected broken neck in 1798. After his death Dr Porter, a bone specialist, had his skeleton boiled in order to preserve and study it. The remains were donated to a Waterbury museum in 1933 by a descendent of Dr Porter who referred to the skeleton as 'Larry'. Since then the bones have been studied by scientists keen to learn more about Fortune and his life. So far scientists have established . that Fortune was 5ft 5in tall and died aged roughly 55. Though the . results have ruled out hanging as a cause of death, nobody knows exactly . how Fortune broke his neck. We do know that in life he suffered with a fractured left hand, a severe ankle sprain and lower back pain. Richard . Gonzalez, an assistant professor at Quinnipiac's school of medicine, . said that at the time of Fortune's death he was 'an individual who was . in considerable distress.' He was never buried in case technology . allowed more information to be extracted from his remians in the future, but now a CT . scan of the bones has been taken meaning they can be studied without the . need to keep them. When Fortune died in 1798 slavery was still common throughout the US, especially in the South, and wasn't abolished for another 66 years . Maxine Watts, past president of the NAACP, agreed that it was time for the bones to be buried. She said: 'Now we feel even though he was used that way he did prove underneath the skin we're all the same.' The Rev. Amy D. Welin of St. John's Episcopal Church in Waterbury, who will preside at the funeral, said she considers Fortune a parishioner, though one who died long ago. She said: 'I think it's been a very convoluted path to justice. I'm hoping we can use this as a learning experience and a time of reflection on how do we as human beings treat one another and how do we deal with issues of diversity now.'","Fortune died in 1798 of a suspected broken neck but wasn't hung .

A Bonnie and Clyde-style couple who stole two police cars and sparked a high-speed chase across two states Tuesday have a history of using heroin, according to police. Shayna Sykes and Blake Bills, both 23, began their reckless crime spree when they stole a civilian's car in Pennsylvania over the weekend, which later broke down in Camden, New Jersey. Police later learned that the couple had been spotted trying to buy heroin in the Camden area as early as Sunday. Then on Tuesday, the couple zeroed in on a police car belonging to an officer who had just pulled someone over for a traffic violation. Scroll Down for Video . Suspects: Shayna Sykes (left) and Blake Bills (right), both 23, have a history of using heroin and were spotted trying to buy the drug a couple days before they allegedly stole two police cars . Shayna Sykes, 23, and Blake Bills, 23, pictured with their seven-month-old child were involved in a two-state car chase today in which they stole two police cars . According to authorities, Sykes and . Bills, who were not involved in the violation, jumped into the officer's . car and set off at top speed, rampaging across the Ben Franklin Bridge into . Philadelphia. Police finally managed to apprehend the couple at 7th and . Norris Streets in Philadelphia, but Sykes managed to evade officers while they . took Bills into custody. She made off in another police car before she . herself was arrested just 15 minutes later. 'I've never heard of anybody stealing two police cars in the same incident,' said Deputy Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard J. Ross Jr. adding that the incident was 'bold, reckless and absolutely brazen.' The couple from Macungie, Pennsylvania, . have a checkered history with the law and were already wanted by Camden . police after an incident on Sunday when they evaded a chasing police . car, causing it to crash. Camden Police Chief Scott Thomson said the thwarted officer had interrupted them buying drugs. 'They're our junky version of Bonnie and Clyde,' said Thomson. Camden Police Chief Scott Thomson described the pair as 'Our junky version of Bonnie and Clyde' after they were apprehended today after the 15-minute long car chase . The car driven by the couple (top left) was pursued by officers of the New Jersey State Police and Philadelphia Police Department . A news helicopter followed the dramatic chase as fire bellowed from the exhaust of the car as it sped around north Philadelphia . The shocking chase began just before 10 a.m. this morning when a Camden officer pulled over a car at Haddon Avenue and Federal Street in the crime ridden city. 'During the course of the stop, while the officer was outside his vehicle, two suspects entered the police cruiser and pulled off, striking the officer with the police vehicle,' said Camden City spokesman  Robert Corrales to Philly.com. Injuring the police officer's leg as he tried to hault their audacious theft, Sykes and Bills raced over the Ben Franklin Bridge to Philadelphia. The Delaware River Port Authority notified their colleagues in the city of brotherly love that the stolen car was headed their way and that officers from New Jersey State Police were in pursuit. Crashing the car in the north of Philadelphia, police arrested Bills, but Sykes, escaped and managed to commandeer an empty police cruiser at 5th and Clearfield Streets one mile from where they had crashed. The car chase began in Camden, New Jersey just before 10 a.m. and finished 1100 N. Hope Street in Philadelphia just under 20 minutes later . After Blakes Bills was arrested - Shayna Sykes managed to steal another police car in Philadelphia and is seen here almost striking a female pedestrian . Sykes proceeded to drive erratically along the winding streets of Philadelphia and side-swiped numerous vehicles . Police remarked after Sykes was arrested that it was a minor miracle that no one was seriously injured in the car chase . She motored off, striking numerous vehicles along the narrow streets and almost struck a female pedestrian but she was eventually boxed in by chasing police officers and arrested after a slight struggle. Philadelphia police have charged the couple, who are suspected of being on drugs, with resisting arrest, DUI, eluding police, risking a catastrophe, and related offenses. In addition, Camden County authorities have charged the two with Aggravated Assault and Theft. 'It was like a movie or something just unreal because we never seen anything like this before,' North Philadelphia resident Eric Brown said to ABC Local. Shayna Sykes was bundled into the back of a police car when she was finally arrested after her and boyfriend Blake Bills 15-minute trail of destruction was over . Police officials in New Jersey and Pennsylvania said they were sure that toxicology tests will prove positive for both Sykes (pictured) and Bills . Philadelphia Deputy Police Commissioner Richard Ross said it was lucky that only two people were hurt in the mad 15-minute car chase. 'A lot of people could have gotten hurt. It just was bizarre. In my time on this job, which is almost a quarter of a century, I've never heard of an instance where two police cars were stolen in the same incident,' said Ross. Questioned on the wisdom of police officers leaving keys in the ignition, Ross was dismissive. 'You can Monday morning quarterback all day long, but at that particular time, I think it's safe to say that officer's first decision they had to make was the safety of their fellow officers,' said Ross. 'I would imagine if you were to poll police departments across the country, you probably would not find very many where they turn their car off during a car stop.' Ross said the suspects were most likely intoxicated. 'You best bet a toxicology will be done and we do have every reason to believe that drugs were involved,' said Ross.","Shayna Sykes, 23, and Blake Bills, 23, steal a police cruiser in Camden, New Jersey and crash in North Philadelphia .

More secrets have emerged from the diary of RFK Jr including that he found aspects of family life so excruciating that he had to escape. Another batch of excerpts from Kennedy's stolen diary, published in The New York Post today, revealed that a mall shopping trip with his wife Mary and children was a 'nightmare'. The diary from 2001 is jam-packed with Kennedy's encounters with the higher echelons of politics and the celebrity circuit. Family trouble: Robert Kennedy Jr., his wife Mary and their children in 2008. He describes in his diary how he had to escape during one trip to a mall . Celebrity friends: Robert F. Kennedy Jr and actor Leonardo DiCaprio once discussed environmental issues over dinner . In one story he tells how Leonardo Di Caprio came for dinner to discuss environmental issues and his son asked if the actor was a girl because of his long hair. He added that the A-lister was 'very sweet'. In another encounter noted down in the diary, this time with Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld star Larry David, the comedian told Kennedy: 'The Davids are antithetical to the . Kennedys. With the exception of politics, we have nothing in common. 'We . are appalled by the things you do, the way you people live your lives.' Despite at one point, gushing 'I’ve got the best family ever', RFK also notes points when he is frustrated with the banality of it all. According to the Post, he wrote: 'I’m embarrassed to say we went to a mall . today with the kids and Mary. 'I tried to be . stand-up about the experience. But it was one of the worst nightmares of . my existence... the kids turned into savages. I had to leave.' Star treatment: Kennedy with his partner actress Cheryl Hines, actress Amy Landecker and Larry David . Mixing with the best: Larry David, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and actor Albert Brooks . In 2001, Mary Kennedy and Robert had had their fourth child and living at the family estate in Westchester. However the marriage was already crumbling with RFK Jr noting the names of 37 women in his diary that year with apparently scores out of ten next to their names. Mary Kennedy, who had drug and alcohol problems along with depression, committed suicide in May 2012 in the midst of a bitter divorce battle. Kennedy's diary is also littered with glamorous parties and dinners that come with the rarefied life of being born a Kennedy. RFK Jr wrote that George W. Bush asked him and his wife Mary to dinner shortly after he was elected President. A 2001 diary belonging to Robert F. Kennedy Jr. , pictured with late wife Mary, has been unearthed that gives a stunning insight into the number of affairs he carried out during the same year that she gave birth to their fourth child . Kennedy, who comes from a long-line of Democrats, debated whether it was a good idea to go to a Republican White House. He later described Bush as a 'simpleton' following the 9/11 attacks. He also writes that Alec Baldwin called him for advice during his acrimonious divorce from Kim Basinger. Kennedy, a renowned conservationist, also notes his trips in a private Cessna to various glamorous parties. He describes how he flew from Cape Cod . to the Hamptons in August 2001 to go to a party thrown by socialite Anne Hearst - although complained that the party was 'a show, a scene'. Kennedy has put out a statement condemning publication of the diary but confirming that they did in fact come from him. 'The New York Post has chosen to print . excerpts from a 13-year-old diary illegally stolen from me,' he said in a . statement to the paper. 'Creepy': RFK Jr was in jail with Rev. Al Sharpton (left) and the wife of Rev. Jesse Jackson (right), and he wrote disparagingly about the two black civil rights leaders . In previous explosive revelations, it was revealed that Kennedy wrote that Reverends . Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton 'give me the creeps' and that their . obvious agendas did a disservice to their political goals. The . revelations come on top of his admissions about 'lust demons' that . drove him to cheat on his wife Mary, who killed herself last year just . days after he filed for divorce. 'The diary served as a tool for self-examination and for dealing with my spiritual struggles at the time. It also contains unedited, unfiltered stream-of-consciousness musings about current events and people.’ Those newsworthy people included a number of politicians from his own party - and even his own family. At the time that the diary was written, Kennedy's sister Kerry was married to Andrew Cuomo when he was the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Family: At the time the journal was written, Robert's sister Kerry (left, see in 1990) was married to Andrew Cuomo (right), who was then worked in the Department of Housing and Urban Development but was mulling a gubernatorial run . When Andrew came to his then-brother-in-law for advice about a possible gubernatorial run- hoping to follow in his father Mario's footsteps. In the journal, Robert wrote that Cuomo could win due to his energy and focus, but 'he could lose because he lacks humanity and doesn't love people'. Ends up that Robert was right at the time since Cuomo's 2002 bid for governor failed but he went on to win in 2010. That wasn't the only entry where . Kennedy weighed in on the Cuomo family's legal skills, as then-retired . Governor Mario helped try to get Kennedy out of a jail sentence after he . and several other activists were arrested during a demonstration in . Vieques, Puerto Rico. Kennedy was jailed alongside Reverend Al Sharpton and the wife of Jesse Jackson. During . lock up, he apparently had plenty of time to critique his fellow . Democrats, saying that Sharpton 'has done more damage to the black . cause' than segregationist governors in the south who prevented school . integration. '(Sharpton's) transparent venal blackmail and extortion schemes taint all black leadership,' Kennedy wrote. Kennedy spent 30 days in a Puerto Rican jail alongside Rev. Al Sharpton in July 2001 after getting arrested for trespassing at a U.S. Navy training facility. Kennedy, pictured at his wife Mary's graveside last year with their children, writes in his diary about his feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on her . Jackson wasn't spared sharp criticism either, as Kennedy wrote that he had 'a desperate and destructive addiction to publicity'. 'I feel dirty around him, and I feel like I’m being used. I feel like with Jesse, it’s all about Jesse,' he added. The timing of the journal means that it included the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. As a result, he included some withering reviews of the Republican response. He wrote that President George Bush was 'an idiot and a puppet' and New York City's then-mayor Rudy Giuliani was a 'little despot' who was 'desperate' to hold on to his position of power. Robert F. Kennedy Jnr with his late wife Mary Richardson Kennedy, left, in 2008 and, right, with girlfriend Cheryl Hines in 2011. In the journal RFK kept a 'ledger' with a rating system of all the women he slept with . Kennedy wrote that he had his own . power control issues, as he made startling admissions of his own . feelings of guilt and remorse at repeatedly cheating on his wife. ‘I’m . like Adam and live in Eden, and I can have everything but the fruit. But the fruit is all I want,’ he wrote on November  5, 2001. On days when he doesn’t cheat, Kennedy writes ‘victory’ to signify that he resisted sexual temptation. He . even used a section at the back of his diary, headed ‘cash accounts,’ to list the first names of women he had cavorted with and gave each a . mark out of ten. The list . contains the names of 37 women, 16 of whom have the number ten beside . them - which is believed to have signified that they had full . intercourse.","A diary belonging to Robert F.

"By . Chris Brooke . PUBLISHED: . 19:50 EST, 15 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:39 EST, 16 September 2013 . Dr Sarah Wollaston holds the seat for Totnes, in Devon. The Tory MP has said niqabs are 'offensive' and 'make women invisible' A Tory MP yesterday urged the Government to ban full facial veils in all schools and colleges because they were ‘making women invisible’. Dr Sarah Wollaston said some women found the niqab ‘deeply offensive’ and should not be accused of being bigoted for criticising them. She made the comments on Twitter following a college’s U-turn last week on banning students wearing veils and before a judge is due to decide today on whether  a Muslim woman can stand trial while wearing one. Dr Wollaston, the MP for Totnes in Devon, said: ‘The niqab should be banned within schools and colleges; how on earth do they promote equality when they collude with making women invisible?’ She also wrote: ‘A general ban on the niqab simply won’t happen in the UK but that doesn’t mean that it should be endorsed by schools or courts.’ Her comments were met by a backlash from supporters of the veil, but she stood her ground against the angry criticism. The MP said her view was ‘not bigotry’ and that this accusation was ‘the cudgel used to repress debate’. She added: ‘Feminists should be allowed to say that they find the niqab deeply offensive without being accused of being bigoted or Islamaphobic.’ Prime Minister David Cameron has indicated his support for the college, but Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has admitted he is ‘uneasy’ about banning full-face veils. Last week, Birmingham Metropolitan College was forced to drop its ban on students wearing full facial veils on its campus after a protest. A 9,000-name petition saw its principal back down on its policy after it was accused of ‘Islamophobia’. The ban stopped Muslim pupils wearing the niqab, the full facial veil in which only the eyes are visible, or the burqa where the eyes are covered with mesh. But the college was attacked for its stance by local councillors, MPs and the National Union of Students. The Tory MP posted a string of controversial tweets in light of recent events concerning full-face veils . Among the tweets hitting back at the MP’s comments were from Muslim commentator Mohammed Ansar. He said: ‘Poor Sarah Wollaston’s twitter feed has become a total car crash of bigotry, Islamophobia, historical ignorance and exceptionalism.’ He added: ‘Do you accept and support the right of a woman to dress as she wishes?’ One woman asked the MP on Twitter: ‘How about asking a woman who wears niqab what she thinks about her freedom? Or does her opinion not matter?’ A student at Birmingham Metropolitan College wears a full veil after the college reversed its position which previously banned students from wearing niqabs so they could be 'easily identifiable at all times' The wearing of veils in public faces another test in court today. A judge at Blackfriars Crown Court in London allowed a woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to plead not guilty while wearing her veil last month. She argued she was unable to remove the face covering in the presence of men for religious reasons, but as a compromise she allowed a female police officer in a room next to the courtroom to lift it to check her identity. The judge will now decide on whether she will be able to wear her veil during her trial for intimidating a witness, as he feared jurors would not be able to see her facial expressions during questioning. A veil ban at the Birmingham college had been in place for eight years without protest. But an anonymous prospective student complained to her local paper, saying that she was being discriminated against, and the publicity sparked an online campaign. Birmingham Metropolitan College is believed to be the only  college in the UK to have banned the niqab. Some 43 per cent of its 44,000 students come from ethnic groups that are non white. An online petition was signed by 9,000 people, amid rumours that the college was also planning to ban prayers on its premises. The college was forced to amend its policy, which also covered hoodies and hats, which had been brought in to make sure students were always ‘easily identifiable’.","Dr Sarah Wollaston for Totnes, Devon, say schools 'collude with making women invisible' if they allow niqab .

For the first time in their long and impressive careers, internationally renowned photographers Bruce Weber and David Bailey have joined forces and the resulting project is stunning. The lifelong friends explored the vibrant streets of Harlem in New York City for 24 hours this summer. As always, they did so through the lenses of their cameras. Unlike most projects—or any project they’d ever done before, for that matter—this time those cameras were attached to smartphones. Leaving their expensive professional gear at home, the legends were out to demonstrate the photographic power of the Nokia Lumia 1020. The resulting collection is a testament to the legends' formidable talents, the dazzle and allure of Harlem in the summertime, and one phone’s ability to double as a truly superior camera. 'Nokia has created a smartphone which not only matches the capabilities of many high-end cameras, but in most cases surpasses them,’ said Weber. ‘It simplifies creative photography.' Vivid: Legendary photographers Bruce Weber and David Bailey spent a hot summer day in Harlem in July capturing the vibrant spirit of the neighborhood using just smartphones . Gorgeous: The duo used only a Nokia Lumia 1020, and their formidable skills, to capture the neighborhood's summertime essence . Impressive: 'I don't do digital and this is the first time I have really gone out in the world and done like a digital sitting,' said Weber. 'I was impressed with the resolution and the beauty of the color' Captivating:The duo was scheduled to take photos at a Harlem boxing studio, but along the way they found plenty of other engaging scenes to capture . 'I've always loved it, it's always been my favorite place in New York City,' Weber said of Harlem. 'I've just always enjoyed the people' On display: The London exhibition, entitled Weber X Bailey by Nokia Lumia 1020 will run until September 21 and features 30 of the dazzling photos . Mastery: 'The photos from Weber and Bailey¿s shoot are dazzling', said Nokia marketing VP Mark Newton. 'They are a reflection of Weber and Bailey¿s mastery of the art of photography' 'If it takes a picture, I'm going to use it': Weber said he was not intimidated at the prospect of a shoot done entirely with the Nokia phone, and was quite happy with the results . 'I think the heat really brought a lot of people out, you know, in a different way,' Weber said. 'Some people were in bathing suits, some people were in big hats - it's kinda crazy!' 'This is the first time that I have used a mobile phone for my work,' said Weber, who shot in color, despite the fact that black-and-white imagery has defined his career . Volumes: Weber, pictured, took a combined 1,000 photos with Bailey. 30 of them will be displayed at the Nicholls & Clarke Building in Shoreditch in East London through September 21 .

A paedophile has been jailed after he was tracked down sleeping rough as a tramp in France following a five-year manhunt. Peter Scott, 58, fled the UK after a string of sex attacks on three girls in the 1980s, two of whom were a young as 11 when the abuse started. Scott, originally from Manchester, was arrested earlier this year after he was found living on the streets of Foix, a small, picturesque city in southern France close to the border with Spain. Spot the difference: After five years on the run living as a tramp in Foix, France, Peter Scott, 58, is almost unrecognisable with his huge beard compared to his former self . Police had made an unsuccessful appeal to trace him in 2009 using a digitally-enhanced picture to show how he may have aged. But he was finally caught after making an application for a new passport as part his attempts to secure a council house. The application triggered an alert to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and a European Arrest Warrant was obtained and Scott was later extradited. Scott was jailed for eight years at Manchester Crown Court on Friday after he admitted 23 offences including gross indecency with a child and indecent assault on a child. He was also ordered to sign on to the sex offenders register for life. Prison: Peter Scott was jailed on Friday at Manchester Crown Court (pictured) after pleading guilty to 23 counts including indecent assault on a child during the 1980s . Scott had repeatedly preyed on his victims in Manchester, Hattersley, Greater Manchester and St Helens, Merseyside, over several years in the 1980s. But they kept their ordeals secret until coming forward in 2007. Checks made at the time suggested Scott was living in a house in Swansea but when police investigated they found he was no longer there. After receiving a tip-off that he was attempting to flee the country a warning was issued to all ports but Scott slipped the net. Detective Sergeant Suzanne Keenaghan, of GMP, said: 'Our determination to find Peter Scott was greater than his determination to avoid this day. 'When we realised he may have exiled himself abroad, we put in place a number of controls that meant there was only so much Scott could do without us becoming aware of his whereabouts.' She added: 'The abuse that these victims suffered through the years is unimaginable. Having spent so much time with them through the whole process I am able to see first-hand the major impact this has had on their lives. 'I just hope now that this may bring some closure to them so that they can try to move on. 'They have a lot to be proud of in the way they conducted themselves throughout the entire process bearing in mind they reported it in 2007 and didn't get their justice until 2013. 'These women should give an example to anyone else who may have suffered similar abuse. 'I understand that many victims feel that the easiest thing to do is simply try and forget about the past and keep their experiences bottled up.

A double killer is believed to have murdered again within hours of being freed early – for the second time. Ian McLoughlin, 55, went to the home of a paedophile he had met in jail and allegedly stabbed a neighbour to death after a row broke out. Last night, as police hunted the ‘dangerous’ fugitive, relatives of one of his earlier victims demanded to know why a ‘monster’ had been freed allegedly to murder again. And the widow of the latest man to die said: ‘I’ve lost my rock.’ Family man: Graham Buck, 66, who died int he latest killing, is circled in a family photo . Police looking for double killer Ian McLoughlin in connection with a suspected murder in a quiet village have released this image . Wanted: Ian McLoughlin is believed to have met convicted paedophile Francis Cory-Wright, 88, in prison . McLoughlin, who also used the name . Baker, was freed from jail on day release on Saturday morning and by the . afternoon had apparently stabbed to death a Good Samaritan who caught . him robbing a neighbour’s home. On his first day of unsupervised . release, McLoughlin is said to have targeted the £1million home of Old . Etonian Francis Cory-Wright, 87,a convicted paedophile he got to know . while the two were in prison together. He is believed to have been . interrupted by a neighbour, named yesterday as grandfather and . father-of-three Graham Buck, who overheard shouting and went to help. McLoughlin is suspected of grabbing a . knife from the kitchen and repeatedly stabbing Mr Buck, 66, a retired . businessman, before fleeing with thousands of pounds in cash. The killing has disturbing . similarities to his first two killings, both of which were followed by . the theft of the dead man’s belongings. In 1990, McLoughlin forced his . landlord, Peter Halls, to lie down on the bed then stabbed him through . the neck and stole luxury goods worth thousands of pounds. Forensics officers today worked at Cory-Wright's stone house in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire . Victim's home: A statement released by Mr Buck's family today said: 'We were all in such a happy place as a family... We cannot get over that we have lost him' That brutal murder took place only 17 months after he was released from a five-year jail term for another killing. At the time, Mr Halls’s sister Pamela . condemned his release from jail in the first place, saying: ‘McLoughlin . should not have been released after he committed this sort of crime the . first time.’ Yesterday, when it emerged that he was . granted day release from an open prison as part of his . ‘rehabilitation’, she branded the justice system ‘a joke’. The 71-year-old mother-of-two from . Brighton said: ‘This monster has struck again and has been allowed to . strike again because he has been freed to walk the streets just as he . was with my poor brother. ‘Justice in this country is just a . joke. How can this man keep being released to kill again? He was given a . life sentence and that should have meant life. If it did it looks like . this poor chap in Hertfordshire would still be alive. ‘I pray he is caught soon. Nothing can . change men like McLoughlin, he is evil and should have been left . rotting in a prison cell where he deserves to be, not free to kill and . kill again.’ Company director Graham Buck, 66, left, died after he went to help neighbour Francis Cory-Wright, 87, right . She said she had spent more than 20 years trying to come to terms with her brother’s killing. She said: ‘I have tried to put Peter’s . killing behind me but you never forget. Now all the terrible emotions I . felt have come back to the surface. ‘McLoughlin has never shown a scrap of remorse for what he did to Peter. I would be happy if they gave him a lethal injection.’ Mr Buck leaves a wife, two sons, a . daughter and two grandchildren, and a wife from a previous marriage. His . wife, Karen, a 55-year-old nurse, said: ‘I’ve lost my rock. I wouldn’t . be able to do half the things I’ve done since being with Graham if it . wasn’t for him. He and his family have always been there for me in . difficult times. I don’t know what I’ll do without him.’ In a statement, his family added: ‘We . have no words to express how much Graham will be missed. We were all in . such a happy place as a family. We were all so settled, with growing . numbers of grandchildren whom he adored being around. ‘We haven’t seen him happier than being around his grandchildren, he was so proud. We cannot get over that we have lost him.’ Police and forensics officers worked on the houses belonging to both Mr Buck and Cory-Wright today . Idyllic: Police officers today guarded the house of stabbing victim Graham Buck in the quiet rural village . McLoughlin first killed in 1983 aged 25. After crashing his car while drunk he admitted to police he had done a ‘bad thing’. They went to the home of Len Delgatty, . 49, from Stoke Newington, North London, and found his body upside down . in a cupboard, with the skull smashed in seven times with a hammer. The . house had been ransacked for cash. McLoughlin was charged with murder but . was found guilty of manslaughter, after he claimed he had attacked . Delgatty – who had served time for having sex with teenage boys – only . after he told him of a fantasy for under-age sex. He was released after . only five years after behaving as a ‘model prisoner’, but within 17 . months he had killed again. He was sentenced to 25 years for . murdering Mr Halls, his Brighton landlord, and was not eligible for . parole for another three years. The house of the dead man, who was in his sixties, was cordoned off by police officers after the attack . Police guard the home of Cory-Wright in the sleepy Hertfordshire village of Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted . But early on Saturday, McLoughlin, who . also used the name Baker, was let out of Spring Hill open prison in . Grendon Underwood, Buckinghamshire, for 12 hours unsupervised. He was . due back at 7pm. He made his way to the quiet village . of Little Gaddesden in Hertfordshire, less than 30 miles away, to the . £1million home of Corey-Wright, a former Lloyd’s underwriter whose . grandfather, Sir Arthur Cory-Wright, was High Sheriff of Hertfordshire. The Oxford graduate returned home last year from a 30-month sentence for indecently assaulting a ten-year-old boy 35 years ago. Mr Buck, who lived two doors down, had . been watching the Ashes cricket at home. At around 3.30pm, he overheard . shouting and went to help. Detective Chief Superintendent Jeff . Hill said McLoughlin went to the property for a ‘purely financial . motive’. He warned the public that McLoughlin is ‘extremely dangerous’ and should not be approached. Paying tribute to Mr Buck, he said he had . ‘paid the ultimate price for intervening at the home of an elderly . neighbour’. Cory-Wright, who suffered injuries during the attack, was discharged from hospital yesterday. Police today issued a wanted poster as they said they were launching a 'massive manhunt' for the suspect . Ian John McLoughlin, also known as Ian John Baker, has been described as ‘astonishingly bright’, with an IQ of 140. Born in Lancashire in 1958, he spent much of his youth in care homes and picked up a string of convictions for petty theft and burglary. By his early 20s he was a drifter, reportedly earning money as a rent boy and sleeping rough when his cash ran out. He briefly married at 25, but his marriage collapsed under the strain of his heavy drinking and his continued involvement in crime and prostitution. In October 1983 he was stopped by police after crashing a stolen car in London while drunk. Kept in a cell to sober up, he demanded to see the custody sergeant and told him: ‘I’ve done a bad thing.’ McLoughlin had killed a gay man, Len Delgatty, smashing his skull seven times with a hammer before strangling him with a towel. At his trial, McLoughlin told the jury that Delgatty, 49, – who had previous convictions for sexually abusing teenage boys – had played him an audio tape describing a graphic sexual fantasy of having under-age sex with a teenage boy. McLoughlin claimed he had ‘panicked’ and repeatedly struck out at Delgatty. He said he had thrown the tape away. The jury convicted him of manslaughter, not murder, and he was sentenced to 13 years, reduced to eight on appeal – he was released in 1989 after serving only five years. Seventeen months later he stabbed gay barman Peter Halls, 55, through the neck at his home in Brighton. In July 1992, he was convicted of murder and given a life sentence, with a minimum tariff of 25 years. McLoughlin’s 25-year minimum term would have meant he was eligible for release on licence in 2017 but he was moved to a Category D ‘open resettlement prison’ so he could prepare for life outside.","Police hunt Ian McLoughlin, 55, after suspected murder in quiet Hertfordshire village .

They may look like something out of a low budget horror film but these 'child bollards' are the latest attempt by a council to slow down drivers. Half a dozen of the mannequin-style creations have been placed by the side of the road outside Avenue Primary School in Leicester to fool drivers into thinking a child is about to cross. The hope is that when drivers see the crude plastic features and painted-on school uniforms they will ease off the accelerator. Scary: Bollards resembling children are being used as a traffic-calming measure outside a school in Leicester . But the eerie figures have received a mixed reaction from residents. One bollard has even been knocked over, the driver perhaps distracted by the unsettling gaze of the 3ft-high figure. However, some motorists find them almost too scary - and they have even been compared to Autons, deadly mannequin-like aliens from Dr Who. And the RAC has voiced a concern that they will distract drivers from concentrating on the road. Speaking soon after they were introduced, resident Henry Johnson, 50, said: 'They've got scary eyes. A friend of mine was out walking at night and was really freaked out by them. It's just weird. Mixed reaction: The metal figures have replaced warning triangles that can get lost in an array of signs . 'It reminds me of the Autons from Doctor Who, that were like mannequins that came alive.' The . figures cost £350 each and have been put outside Avenue Primary School . in Leicester as part of a £230,000 road safety scheme. Each mannequin is placed on the pavement close to the kerb facing down the road. Other measures outside the school include a 20mph speed limit, speed humps and a new zebra crossing. Patrick Kitterick, Leicester City Council's cabinet member for regeneration and transport, speaking shortly after the bollards were installed in 2009, said: 'There's been a mixed reaction to them. Some people find them scary with these big eyes staring at you, but some others find them amusing. Experiment: Council bosses hope that the bollards will remind drivers why they must slow down near a school . 'The whole point is whether it is successful and if people actually find they slow down.' 'The . usual signs of warning triangles often get lost in the array of signs. You do see people driving fast outside schools and you do think do they . realise what they're doing? 'This might just remind them. It's a bit out of the ordinary but perhaps it needs to be a bit out of the ordinary.' But he admitted the council did not have any say in the design of the bollards. He said: 'That's how they came when we bought them. I think I saw a film called Children Of The Damned which had a similar set of child-like characters in it. Traffic calming measures: The child bollards were considered to be a cheaper alternative to installing road traffic cameras . 'Compared to the cost of installing a speed camera they are good value for money.' But motoring organisations said the figures could distract drivers and were 'ripe for vandalism'. AA head of road policy Paul Watters said: 'It is a nice idea but it's a shame they can't be retracted when it isn't term time. 'I worry they will be vandalised and can see people having a laugh with them after a few drinks on a Friday night.' A spokesman for the RAC added: 'There is a concern that the statues will become a distraction with drivers focusing on them rather than the road ahead.'

Police investigating a brutal attack on a kitten have been left powerless to take court action against the culprits, because they are as young as four. The 14-week-old animal was swung by her tail, thrown against a wall and kicked ‘like a football’ by the group of three youngsters. She was rescued by an onlooker, but police could not arrest the children - aged four, five and six, who are believed to be Romanian brothers. Attack: The 14-week-old animal was swung by her tail, thrown against a wall and kicked 'like a football' by the group of three youngsters (file picture) This was because they are under ten - the age of criminal responsibility. The kitten, Tia, was treated for head injuries, bruised ribs, injured nose and a black eye. She had been choking on blood running from her nose. Today the kitten’s owner Dawn Tunnacliffe, 33, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: ‘I’m very angry about what happened. ‘I understand the children are from Romania. Animals may be treated differently in other countries - but they are not treated like that. ‘Tia was lucky because she has soft bones like a new baby. If she had been an older cat she wouldn’t have survived.’ The incident occurred on September 8 at 6.30pm when Miss Tunnacliffe was in the back yard chatting to her neighbour Lizzie Isaacs. She said: ‘Tia was playing with some other kittens in the yard when she suddenly went missing. ‘Lizzie went out to check inside her house but then shouted that some children had got hold of Tia in the alley. 'She said they were holding Tia by her tail and kicking her like a football. When she told them to put Tia down, they threw her against a wall. ‘I ran into the alley to find Tia had run off into garden. She was in a lot of distress.’ Location: The kitten's owner Dawn Tunnacliffe, 33, from Oldham (file picture), Greater Manchester, said she was 'very angry' Miss Isaacs, 23, said: ‘The children . threw the kitten against a back wall and hit her about five times. I . screamed at them to put Tia down. 'But they swung her around four times and three her against a wall. They then ran off laughing as Tia hit the wall. ‘We were so angry that we called police. Another of Dawn’s kittens had gone missing and police spoke to the children about it too. ‘They said they didn’t have it but their dad later found that kitten in a bedroom and took it back to Dawn.’ Miss Isaacs’ fiancee Simon Duffy, 28, said: ‘We have three pet cats and a rabbit and these children were stroking one of our cats only 15 minutes before the attack. Now we’ll need to keep our cats indoors.’ 'I’m very angry about what happened. Tia was lucky because she has soft bones like a new baby' Dawn Tunnacliffe, Tia's owner . A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: ‘Inquiries are continuing and the incident was logged as criminal damage but because of the young ages of the children there were no arrests. ‘Police are now looking at options which could include a criminal warning and restorative justice such as making the children meet the kitten’s owner to discuss what’s happened.’ Children under 10 who break the law regularly can sometimes be taken into care, or their parents could be held responsible. Under current legislation police can ban children for up to 90 days from being in a public place between 9pm and 6am, unless accompanied by an adult under the terms of a Local Child Curfew. If a child breaks their curfew, they can be given a Child Safety Order and placed under the supervision of a youth offending team. If a child does not stick to the rules of an order, the court can consider if the child should be taken into care.","Kitten swung by her tail and thrown against a wall .

Fresh sex harassment claims against senior Lib Dems emerged last night. Both male and female members told a meeting they were pestered or groped by party figures, while others claimed there remained a ‘cultural problem’ with sexism. One female activist described how older men would often hug her, but then put their hands on her lower back before letting them ‘slip’ to her bottom. Others felt they just ‘had to put up with’ abuse and claimed their concerns were still not being taken seriously, despite Nick Clegg vowing to tackle the problem following disputed allegations involving Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard. Activists said the police probe into the former chief executive was being used as an ‘excuse’ to sweep other sexual harassment claims under the carpet. The latest revelations came yesterday at a fringe event at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow. Natasha Chapman, a 22-year-old student from Lincoln, described how she was groped and leered at by older men at regional conferences and other events. She said: ‘A few times people’s hands are on your lower back and then you feel the slip. ‘You feel annoyed, but then you do not want to start an argument on the spot. It’s not really very pleasant and it does destroy your confidence.’ She declined to identify the culprits, but claimed the attacks were not made by MPs because they had ‘too much to lose’. ‘It does make me wonder though how many good women candidates we have lost out on since the Rennard claims,’ she added after the meeting. A male Lib Dem councillor – who did not give his name – said he had been sexually harassed by a woman councillor but was told not to risk a by-election by complaining. ‘It wasn’t politically convenient’ to get rid of the councillor, he said. Yesterday’s meeting, organised by a protest group against harassment within the party called Rock the Boat, was not attended by a single senior Lib Dem. Founder James Shaddock said many were using the police probe into Lord Rennard as ‘an excuse to avoid the issue’. Nick Clegg vowing to tackle the problem following disputed allegations involving Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard . Chris White, a councillor in St Albans, Hertfordshire, told the group there was a ‘cultural problem’ in the party. He described how a female councillor said women who dress provocatively ‘are asking for it’ and claimed that older people in the party tolerated sexual harassment because they felt they ‘had to put up with it’. ‘Older people feel if you are robust this problem will go away, he said. ‘That is not an attitude that is acceptable at all. We have to have zero tolerance.’ A Lib Dem spokesman acknowledged there were ‘failings in the past’ which led to an independent inquiry into the party’s culture and practices. Party leader Nick Clegg later said he had ‘no idea’ why there were no senior figures at the event in Glasgow. ‘We have always taken issues like that very seriously and we will continue to do so,’ he said.","Both male and female members told a meeting they were pestered or groped by party figures .

A Bonnie and Clyde-style couple stole not one, but two police cars today - causing officers to launch a frantic 100 mph pursuit which spanned two states and injured two people. Shayna Sykes, 23, and Blake Bills, 23, began their reckless crime spree this morning when a Camden, New Jersey police officer stopped a car for a traffic violation. According to authorities, Sykes and Bills, who were not involved at all with the violation, simply jumped into the officers car and set off at speed, rampaging across the Ben Franklin Bridge into Philadelphia. But as they were apprehended at 7th and . Norris Streets in the city, Sykes managed to evade officers while they . took Bills into custody and made off in another police car before she . herself was arrested just 15 minutes later. Scroll Down for Video . Shayna Sykes, 23, and Blake Bills, 23, pictured with their seven-month-old child were involved in a two-state car chase today in which they stole two police cars . 'I've never heard of anybody stealing two police cars in the same incident,' said Deputy Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard J. Ross Jr. adding that the incident was 'bold, reckless and absolutely brazen.' The couple from Macungie, Pennsylvania, have a checkered history with the law and were already wanted by Camden police after an incident on Sunday when they evaded a chasing police car, causing it to crash. Camden Police Chief Scott Thomson said the thwarted officer had interrupted them buying drugs. 'They're our junky version of Bonnie and Clyde,' said Thomson. Camden Police Chief Scott Thomson described the pair as 'Our junky version of Bonnie and Clyde' after they were apprehended today after the 15-minute long car chase . The car driven by the couple (top left) was pursued by officers of the New Jersey State Police and Philadelphia Police Department . A news helicopter followed the dramatic chase as fire bellowed from the exhaust of the car as it sped around north Philadelphia . The shocking chase began just before 10 a.m. this morning when a Camden officer pulled over a car at Haddon Avenue and Federal Street in the crime ridden city. 'During the course of the stop, while the officer was outside his vehicle, two suspects entered the police cruiser and pulled off, striking the officer with the police vehicle,' said Camden City spokesman  Robert Corrales to Philly.com. Injuring the police officer's leg as he tried to hault their audacious theft, Sykes and Bills raced over the Ben Franklin Bridge to Philadelphia. The Delaware River Port Authority notified their colleagues in the city of brotherly love that the stolen car was headed their way and that officers from New Jersey State Police were in pursuit. Crashing the car in the north of Philadelphia, police arrested Bills, but Sykes, escaped and managed to commandeer an empty police cruiser at 5th and Clearfield Streets one mile from where they had crashed. The car chase began in Camden, New Jersey just before 10 a.m. and finished 1100 N. Hope Street in Philadelphia just under 20 minutes later . After Blakes Bills was arrested - Shayna Sykes managed to steal another police car in Philadelphia and is seen here almost striking a female pedestrian . Sykes proceeded to drive erratically along the winding streets of Philadelphia and side-swiped numerous vehicles . Police remarked after Sykes was arrested that it was a minor miracle that no one was seriously injured in the car chase . She motored off, striking numerous vehicles along the narrow streets and almost struck a female pedestrian but she was eventually boxed in by chasing police officers and arrested after a slight struggle. Philadelphia police have charged the couple, who are suspected of being on drugs, with resisting arrest, DUI, eluding police, risking a catastrophe, and related offenses. In addition, Camden County authorities have charged the two with Aggravated Assault and Theft. 'It was like a movie or something just unreal because we never seen anything like this before,' North Philadelphia resident Eric Brown said to ABC Local. Shayna Sykes was bundled into the back of a police car when she was finally arrested after her and boyfriend Blake Bills 15-minute trail of destruction was over . Police officials in New Jersey and Pennsylvania said they were sure that toxicology tests will prove positive for both Sykes (pictured) and Bills . Philadelphia Deputy Police Commissioner Richard Ross said it was lucky that only two people were hurt in the mad 15-minute car chase. 'A lot of people could have gotten hurt. It just was bizarre. In my time on this job, which is almost a quarter of a century, I've never heard of an instance where two police cars were stolen in the same incident,' said Ross. Questioned on the wisdom of police officers leaving keys in the ignition, Ross was dismissive. 'You can Monday morning quarterback all day long, but at that particular time, I think it's safe to say that officer's first decision they had to make was the safety of their fellow officers,' said Ross. 'I would imagine if you were to poll police departments across the country, you probably would not find very many where they turn their car off during a car stop.' Ross said the suspects were most likely intoxicated. 'You best bet a toxicology will be done and we do have every reason to believe that drugs were involved,' said Ross.","Shayna Sykes, 23, and Blake Bills, 23, steal a police cruiser in Camden, New Jersey and crash in North Philadelphia .

A champion swimmer who used a pair of mirrored goggles to spy on a woman in a changing room cubicle walked free from court today. Freestyle record-breaker James Mackay, 28, who has competed for Great Britain, angled the swimming goggles against a shampoo bottle so he could see into the neighbouring changing room at a leisure centre. The married father-of-one, who was found guilty of three charges of voyeurism following a trial last month, was today ordered to pay his victim £250 compensation and £620 court costs. Voyeurism: Married James Mackay, seen left shielding his face outside court today and right smiling for the camera, was found guilty of three charges of voyeurism following a trial last month . Mackay, from Redditch, Worcester, who now works at a Mini dealership, was also made the subject of a 12-month supervision order and must sign the Sex Offenders’ Register for five years. He was also banned from attending the Abbey Stadium Sports Centre for one year, but escaped a ban from other pools across the country. Sentencing him at Redditch Magistrates . Court, chairman of the bench Peter Sheppard told him: 'They [the . offences] are very similar in nature, targeting one victim. 'Those . present at the trial will have understood the significant distress of . the victim having to come to court to give evidence. 'It took considerable courage and that should not be trivialised,' he said. Voyeurism: The 28-year-old was ordered to pay his victim £250 in compensation and £620 court costs, he was also made to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for five years . The court heard Mackay, who set the British 800m freestyle record in 2004, targeted the same woman on three separate occasions between August and September last year at the Redditch sports centre. His victim became ‘uneasy’ when Mackay, from Redditch, spent a suspicious amount of time in the showers, as if waiting for her to return from the pool. The woman, who cannot be named, told the trial that on the first occasion she noticed Mackay’s blue flippers and sports bottle inside a cubicle. She chose one further away but he moved in to the dressing room next to her, when she noticed his distinctive orange and black goggles on the floor. She said: 'I was taking my swimming costume off and put my towel round me and then I heard the door next door. 'I saw this flash of blue flippers, he had moved next to me. 'I then noticed the goggles. They were at an angle and looking into the cubicle. 'I felt uncomfortable but I thought I was being paranoid.' Spying: Mackay was ordered to pay his victim compensation and told he must sign the Sex Offenders' Register at Redditch Magistrates' Court today . On two further occasions the woman purposely chose a cubicle against a wall and blocked the middle gap with her bag, but Mackay chose the cubicle behind her. She said: 'I started to shake and I felt no one had taken me seriously. 'I videoed the goggles so I could show the Abbey Stadium.' JPs refused to ban him the swimmer from pools nationwide despite recommendations made by the Probation Service. Jonathan Barker, defending, said: 'You have of course found that these offences were committed in the vicinity of a swimming pool and the great irony in this case is of course that for a significant part of Mr Mackay’s life great things have been achieved in the swimming pool. 'He has held British records for the 800 metres and 1,500 metres for the 19-24 age group. 'In 2004 he swam outdoors for Great Britain. 'For such a long period the swimming pool has been synonymous with positive things in his life and now it has negative connotations. 'Without question, making a hole and what that allows the person to see is far more invasive than using a pair of goggles and relying upon the reflection of those goggles to see what was in the next changing room. 'You must note that the defendant has chosen not to attend any swimming pools since the allegations against him have been made. 'It may comfort you to know that he has no intention of swimming in the near future,' Mr Barker added. The court heard Mackay maintains his innocence and plans to appeal his conviction. Both Mackay and school teacher wife Stephanie, who attended yesterday’s hearing, declined to comment outside court. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","James Mackay used goggles to watch same woman in cubicle three times .

"PUBLISHED: . 20:09 EST, 14 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:48 EST, 16 September 2013 . A world champion surfer has criticized surf clothing company Roxy over a sexy ad released to promote its brand. Californian surfer Cori Schumacher says the latest advert by Roxy, timed to coincide with an international surfing contest, focuses too much on women's bodies and not enough on their skill in the water. The 36-year-old presented a petition containing more than 20,000 signatures to the designer's Orange County offices on Thursday, claiming Roxy is damaging the image of women athletes. Wrong message: A surfer has complained about Roxy's sexy advert . Focus: The ad features champion surfer Stephanie Gilmore, but critics complained that the viewer never sees her face, or surfing skills . 'Surfing should be a place where women . can show they're strong and powerful. Ads like Roxy's ads prove women . are still navigating gender bias that reinforces harmful stereotypes,' she told the Los Angeles Times. Schumacher said she was incensed by the advert, featuring seductive shots of Australian surfer Stephanie Gilmore's body, but without showing her face, or her riding any waves. The ad was created to promote the Roxy Pro Biarritz contest sponsored by the clothing line this summer. 'This tells young girls it's more important to be sexy than to be strong or a good surfer,' Schumacher said, according to news.com.au. The lifelong surfer has always competed without sponsorship so she can easily speak out on issues important to her, such as gender inequality. 'Roxy's recent ad ... reinforces the inequalities women face in surfing and other sports,' Schuamacher, who won her third long boarding world championships in an event sponsored by the brand in 2010, said. Petition: Cori Schumacher, seen here winning her third long board title, collected more than 20,000 signatures protesting about the advert . It is not just Schumacher who was disappointed by the advert. Roxy's Facebook page attracted lots of criticism, according to the Inquisitor. One person commented: 'Utterly disgusted that a brand which promotes natural beauty with vast female base clients focus so much on sexualizing a female athlete’s body when promoting a world surfing event.' Another said the advert went against Roxy's own tagline 'Women are complex and multi-dimensional' by not showing Gillmore's face. 'You only showed one dimension of women (how they look) so therefore you have ignored who we truly are. There should be surfing in the ad, cause in case you forgot, you’re running a SURFING contest soon!' another commenter posted. Skills: In the first Roxy advert, above, Gilmore is only seen paddling through the waves, but in a later advert, below, the company finally shows her face, and ability . A statement from the company said: 'We believe all athletes are naturally beautiful, in and out of the water. You certainly don’t have to be sexy to be an athlete, we also believe it’s not wrong to be an athlete and to be sexy, if you choose to be.' It added: 'We don’t judge one to be better than the other. We don’t believe in excluding one for the other.' Roxy later released a follow up to the advert that did show champion surfer Gilmore showing off her skills - and her face.","Cori Schumacher says advert 'reinforces harmful stereotypes'

Conman: Basharat Bashir was jailed for three years for stealing £19,000 from pensioners under the guise of selling mobility equipment . A conman tricked several elderly victims out of £19,000 under the guise of selling stairlifts and other mobility equipment. Businessman Basharat Bashir, 33, admitted stealing the money from 11 vulnerable pensioners and spending the money on Sky TV, phones and flashy cars. Birmingham Crown Court heard Bashir, from Sheldon, West Midlands, ripped off the OAPs who paid him for mobility items which never arrived. Bashir was jailed for three years after he admitted 19 charges, including 17 fraud offences and also pleaded guilty to fraudulent trading and money laundering. Sentencing Judge William Davis QC said: ‘You have defrauded a significant number of very vulnerable and very elderly people. ‘It was money they simply couldn’t afford to lose, money doubtless saved over long working hours, hoping to use it to make things easier for them in their declining years.’ The case was brought against Bashir following an investigation by Birmingham City Council’s Trading Standards team. They found that a total 11 pensioners were scammed by Bashir through his company Mobility World (UK) Ltd over a year long period from December 2009. The fraudster pocketed the cash and spent it on his TV needs as well as buying mobile phones and renting luxury cars. Defending Theresa Hunt said Bashir was full of remorse for his actions and wanted to repay his victims, despite having just £20 in the bank. She said: ‘He became a dishonest businessman when cash-flow became so acutely disastrous. ‘He wishes to repay every penny back to his victims. He feels extremely remorseful.’ After the hearing he was branded a ‘scumbag’ by a relative of one of his victims. Joseph Gripton, 87, from Tipton, West Midlands, who died two years before seeing Bashir sentenced, lost almost £10,000 to the fraudster. Today his niece, Jackie Jones, said: ‘My uncle was a proper gentleman who trusted everybody. ‘He was so honest and thought everybody was too but they’re not. There are some scumbags about.’ Vulnerable victims: Bashir (right) conned 11 pensioners through his company Mobility World (UK), including Joseph Gripton (left) who lost almost £10,000 to the fraudster before he died . On one occasion Bashir even drove the retired electrical engineer to a cashpoint so he could withdraw money for a mattress which never arrived. After the case Lord Harris, chairman of the National Trading Standards Board, said: ‘Criminals who deceive consumers by tricking them into paying for products or services they have no intention of delivering cause enormous harm to those on low incomes. ‘In the worst cases, they may destroy the lives of individuals and families. 'Money they simply couldn't afford to lose': Bashir was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) where the court heard that he was 'extremely remorseful' ‘Trading standards are working hard to tackle these despicable criminals.’ Bashir was also banned from holding a company directorship for seven years. In a separate incident earlier this month, conman Andrew Ross, 27, was jailed after he stole thousands of pounds from Justin Bieber fans after falsely promising them the chance to meet their hero. Ross, 27, advertised VIP tickets online to Bieber’s sell-out shows at London’s O2 Arena in March. He was jailed for 12 months after admitting five charges of fraud totalling £6,458 at Hamilton Sheriff Court.","Basharat Bashir, 33, admitted stealing money from 11 pensioners .

A 23-year-old man with Down Syndrome in mixed martial arts (MMA) training for years is now fighting to get into the ring. Garrett Holeve, of Florida, has been denied permission to fight against David Steffan, another disabled fighter. The two men were presented with a cease-and-desist order Aug 2 by the Florida State Boxing Commission just before they were scheduled to step into the ring, according to reports. The fight was organized against Mr Steffan because, having cerebral palsy, he was seen as a fair opponent. Let him fight: Garrett Holeve (pictured) has amputee fighter Nick Newell in his corner . Though state boxing commissions do not . typically regulate amateur MMA fights, they stepped in to stop the fight . between the two disabled men on grounds it was unsanctioned, according . to Headline News. Despite training non-stop for two months and having the backing of promoters, Mitch Holeve, Garrett Holeve’s father, fears the fight might never happen. ‘It's our belief, based on conversation with people within the MMA community, that getting it done in any state isn't going to be easy,’ the father told HLN. Mitch Holeve further explained that he feels his son not being allowed into the ring is a public relations move by the sport. ‘There is a core group of people involved in MMA that are trying to protect the sport from bad PR,’ Mitch Holeve told the network. ""They feel having disabled people compete would give the sport a 'black eye.' They are also afraid of the 'sideshow' effect.’ A conspiracy: Mitch Holeve, the 23-year-old aspiring fighter's father, feels his son isn't being allowed into the ring because insiders want to protect the sport's image - a sentiment with which a promoter who spoke to MailOnline agreed . A prominent New York-based promoter echoed Mitch Holeve's concerns in comments to MailOnline. ‘This . is all image, if somebody gets hurt on your show… I don’t see the . upside to doing that,’ a New York-based fight promoter said. ‘If somebody gets hurt, then you’re the guy who put [a disabled person] in the ring,’ the promoter added. There is a wide gulf between the people in favour of G-Money – as Garrett Holeve is known in the ring – fighting, and those against it. ‘One respected athletic inspector said that allowing Garrett Holeve to fight in an MMA bout was exploitative, no matter if the audience cheered and gave Holeve a standing ovation after the fight,’ Zach Arnold, editor of MMA website Fight Opinion told HLN. ‘The concept of allowing someone with… limited cognitive ability and brain issues to take punches and get slammed drew a swiftly negative reaction amongst the people I interviewed,’ Arnold added. It's his dream: All Mr Holeve wants to do is get in the ring, in a fair fight - he's not gunning for the UFC . Nick Newell, famous for going undefeated in his first 10 professional MMA fights as an amputee, has trained with Holeve – and feels he’s getting a raw deal. ‘I think we should give him a chance,’ Mr Newell told MailOnline. ‘Everyone deserves an equal chance.’ Explaining that he’s also trained with Mr Steffan, Mr Newell – who goes by ‘Notorious’ in the ring, said that both men are equal competitors. ‘I think that’s a good fair fight, the kid’s not asking to fight in the UFC,’ said Mr Newell, adding that ‘he just wants a small-time, amateur fight.’ Explaining that ‘it’s not a street fight,’ and that there are referees and medics, Mr Newell said ‘it’s safety first... it's not like he's even going to be on TV.' Notorious: Mr Newell has won his first 10 pro fights and is a champion, he doesn't feel it's fair to keep Mr Holeve out of the ring . Mr Newell said that he noticed no physical limitations with Garrett Holeve when he trained and that it will not matter if he wins or loses, he just wants to get into the ring. 'People said the same things about me… and look at me, I’m 10-0 and a world champion,' the undefeated fighter said. For now, according to HLN, the two fighters are looking to fight in Nebraska – and Mr Newell is all for it. ‘If the kid’s training hard and chasing his dream, who’s anyone to say he can’t… it’s not fair.’","Garrett Holeve, 23, was set to fight David Steffan, an opponent with cerebral palsy .

Vindication: Christopher Jefferies had been critical of Avon and Somerset Police's handling of his detention, bail and subsequent release without charge over Miss Yeates' death . Police have issued an apology to the landlord of murdered Jo Yeates for not publicly clearing him as a suspect in her death soon enough. Christopher Jefferies received a letter from Avon and Somerset police expressing 'regret' for the first time at the way he was treated after being arrested over Miss Yeates' murder. The retired teacher, 68, hailed what he described as 'public vindication' from Avon and Somerset Police over its handling of his detention, bail and subsequent release without charge after 25-year-old Miss Yeates’ death in December 2010. The 'letter of exoneration expressing . regret' from Chief Constable Nick Gargan - who met the retired teacher . last Friday - acknowledged the 'hurt' caused to Mr Jefferies when the force failed to clear him publicly of suspicion over . Miss Yeates’ murder when releasing him from bail in March 2011. In the letter, Chief Constable Gargan acknowledged: 'The police did not . make it clear publicly that you were no longer a suspect in the . investigation as soon as you were released from bail on March 5, 2011.' Responding to the apology, Mr Jefferies said: 'It provides an important conclusion to the whole aftermath of what I had to go through following my arrest. 'As . the letter itself explains it provides the public vindication which was . not given at the time I was released from police bail. 'Although . the letter is addressed to me and is therefore expressing regret at . what I had to endure, the letter also implicitly provides the public . acceptance that the events didn’t just affect me but affected a large . circle of my relatives and friends.' Mr Jefferies was arrested on December 30 2010 and questioned by detectives for two days before being bailed after Miss Yeates was found dead on Christmas Day.

Manhunt: Police launched a massive hunt to find the killer of Joanna Yeates, pictured on CCTV in the hours before she was murdered by neighbour Vincent Tabak . Dutch national Vincent Tabak, who . lived next door to her and her boyfriend Greg Reardon, 27, at 44 Canynge . Road, Bristol, was jailed for life in October 2011 for her murder. Mr Jefferies won damages from eight newspapers over stories about him after his arrest. As well as paying damages to the former Clifton College teacher, the publishers of the Mirror and the Sun were respectively fined £50,000 and £18,000, plus legal costs after being found guilty of contempt of court. Avon and Somerset police also . revealed they compensated Mr Jefferies for damage to his property done . during the murder investigation, but they refused to divulge exactly how . much. A force spokesman said: 'We settled a . claim in relation to damage at Mr Jefferies’ properties and the loss of . rental income. While the properties were secured as a crime scenes some . damage had occurred as a result of specialist crime scene investigation . and forensic testing. 'As part of the murder investigation it was necessary for the crime scene to be preserved until the end of the trial. ' During Tabak’s trial it was revealed the killer had implicated Mr Jefferies by phoning the police and making false claims. 'I accept unequivocally that you played no part in the murder and that you are wholly innocent of the crime.' 'I understand the length of . time you spent on police bail caused you significant distress and . inevitably prolonged the period of time when you remained in the public . eye as someone who was still suspected of involvement in an appalling . crime.

'While . it is not normal practice to make such a public statement, in the . circumstances of the exceptional media attention your arrest attracted I . acknowledge we should have considered this and I am very sorry for the . suffering you experienced as a result.' Mr Gargan joined Avon and Somerset from the the National Policing Improvement Agency in March, replacing Colin Port, who was in charge at the time of the murder. In his letter to Mr Jefferies, Mr Gargan said the pensioner’s arrest was an 'integral step' in the investigation, but added: 'I accept unequivocally that you played no part in the murder and that you are wholly innocent of the crime.' He added: 'I understand the length of . time you spent on police bail caused you significant distress and . inevitably prolonged the period of time when you remained in the public . eye as someone who was still suspected of involvement in an appalling . crime.

He also said that all DNA, fingerprints and photographs taken of Mr Jefferies after his arrest had been destroyed. In a statement Mr Gargan said the force stood by the decision to arrest the landlord. Apology: Avon and Somerset Police Chief Constable Nick Gargan, left, said the force failed to clear Mr Jefferies publicly of suspicion over Miss Yeates’ murder. Vincent Tabak, right, was eventually found guilty of her murder . 'The . media attention and vilification to which Christopher Jefferies was . subjected during the Joanna Yeates murder investigation was . unprecedented, and I understand how difficult it must have been for . him,' he said. 'It was a complex investigation, . carried out under the most intense public scrutiny and the investigating . officer had to pursue every reasonable line of enquiry. 'Although . I was not chief constable then, I stand by the decision taken at the . time to arrest and interview Christopher Jefferies. 'Nevertheless .

'I . had a private meeting with Mr Jefferies on Friday and hope to use his . experience to inform our serious crime investigations in the future.' Mr Jefferies gave evidence at the . Leveson Inquiry into press standards, with its final report saying . reporting around the former teacher’s arrest had been 'unbalanced, . prejudicial and wildly inaccurate' and calling him 'the victim of a very . serious injustice perpetrated by a significant section of the press'.

It was sent after Daily Mirror editor Richard Wallace told the Leveson Inquiry police had given off-the-record briefings in which they appeared confident that Mr Jefferies 'was their man'. In the letter, referred to by Mr Jefferies in his Leveson witness statement, Mr Port said the editor’s evidence was 'untrue', adding: 'There was an inadvertent disclosure of your name following news reports naming you but as soon as we discovered this had taken place we made it clear to the journalist the information should not have been released and should not be used.'","Christopher Jefferies was arrested for the murder of Jo Yeates .

Frank Racher, 67, died while swimming in the sea after setting off on a cruise around the coastline of Marmaris in Turkey. Mr Racher from Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics after his body was dragged back on board the Mega-Diana cruise ship on Friday. Last photograph: Frank Racher, pictured with his wife June on holiday in Marmaris, Turkey, collapsed and drowned while on a boat trip just moments after this photograph was taken . Mr Racher was on board the boat with his wife June, 61, and other British tourists when it stopped at Paradise Island ten minutes after setting off. Leaving his wife on board, Mr Racher decided to go for a swim, but quickly found himself struggling in the water. Fellow passengers and crew members brought his body back on board before emergency services arrived and performed CPR for nearly half-an hour. Despite their best efforts the man was pronounced dead at the scene. Holiday treat: The couple had gone for a day trip on the Mega-Diana, pictured, when Mr Racher collapsed while taking a swim . One passenger, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It was very sad. One minute we were all enjoying a fabulous day on the water, having a few beers. The next, it was chaos. ‘The crew and coastguard tried so hard to revive him - we can’t believe . he died.

The parents of murdered April Jones can at last begin to plan their daughter's funeral after an inquest into her death was concluded and her death certificate issued. The five-year-old schoolgirl was snatched outside her home in Machynlleth, mid Wales, last October before being murdered by Mark Bridger. The 47-year-old paedophile refused to tell police what he had done with April’s body - although officers did recover a few fragments of her skull from his fireplace. Paul and Coral Jones leave Powys Council Offices after the inquest into their daughter April's death . Coroner Louise Hunt said she could not reach any conclusion which had not already been reached in the court case . The 17 tiny pieces of bone is all that her mother Coral and father Paul have left of their daughter. They have said that not having her body or being able to properly lay her to rest has made their hell worse. The inquest, which had been given . special permission to proceed by the chief coroner in the absence of a . body, was then opened and adjourned. Although technically the file remains open, coroner Mrs Hunt said there would be no further proceedings. The five year old was abducted on October 1 last year and killed by Mark Bridger. Now her family can finally hold a funeral for her following the inquest today . Following . the conclusion of today’s hearing, a death certificate can be issued . and her death can be officially registered - allowing her family to have . an official funeral for her at last. They have been denied that right until now after Bridger refused to say what he did with her body. Mark Bridger has refused to tell police what he did with April's body . The . one-time lifeguard, who was also caught downloading child porn on his . computer, claimed he accidentally ran over April and in the ensuing . panic could not remember what he did with her body. Powys Coroner Louise Hunt said she hoped the conclusion of April’s inquest - which now paves the way for her funeral arrangements to begin - would be a small comfort to the Jones family. She said: 'I want to extend my sympathies for your terrible loss. 'There will be no further formal proceedings and I hope the coming to an end of them will give you time to allow you to deal with your grief.' Attending the 10-minute hearing in . Powys County Council’s Welshpool offices were Mr and Mrs Jones, who were . flanked by family liaison officers from Dyfed Powys Police. They . listened earnestly as the force’s Detective Superintendent Andy John . read a brief outline of the circumstances surrounding April's death. Mr . John, who was the senior investigating officer in the case, said . April’s family reported she had been abducted at 7.20pm on October 1 . last year - prompting a 'significant police response'. He said: 'This resulted in the arrest . of Mark Leonard Bridger on October 2. Following subsequent inquiries, . Bridger was charged with the murder of April, child abduction and . perverting the course of justice. 'This resulted in a criminal trial taking place from April 29 to May 30.' The family plan to place the remains . in a pink coffin and take them through the town of Machynleth, Powys, on . a horse drawn carriage. Although no details were given of when or . where April’s funeral will take place, it is believed that mourners . will be asked to wear pink, which was her favourite colour. It also became a symbol of hope in the wake of her disappearance, with scores of pink ribbons being put up by townsfolk. Hundreds . of people are expected to turn up to say their farewells to the little . girl, with a possible venue being St Peter’s Church in Machynlleth. Bridger was later convicted of all three counts and handed a whole-life prison term - meaning he will die behind bars. Mr John said that April’s body had never been found, but she suffered a 'violent death'. And on the 'balance of probabilities', the youngster died at Bridger’s remote home in Mount Pleasant, Ceinws, on the day she was abducted. April's mother Mrs Jones, 41, told the Sun newspaper last week: 'Our hell this past year has been made worse because we did not have April's body.' Local councillor Michael Williams said a funeral was the 'right and proper' thing to happen. 'I don’t think it will be a final goodbye but it will be another step in remembering all the wonderful times that the family had together,' he said. 'It will bring people together again in one place to remember the life of a little child that was taken so savagely from the family and community.' The inquest follows an attack on imprisoned Bridger, who was reportedly slashed in the face by a fellow convict and murderer. Juvinai Ferreira, 22, who is serving a life sentence pleaded guilty to wounding Mark Bridger in high-security Wakefield Prison when he appeared at Leeds Crown Court via video-link. Ferreira attacked the 47-year-old just months after Bridger was jailed for life for abducting and murdering April, in Machynlleth, Wales last year. No details of the attack were given in court last week and Ferreira will be sentenced on October 2. According to reports at the time of the attack, which happened on July 7, Bridger needed hospital treatment to a face wound after he was slashed with a makeshift knife. He was returned to Wakefield after his injury was stitched.","April's death certificate can now be issued and her death officially registered .

Announcement: Justine Greening, pictured, announced an additional pledge of £50m to warn-torn Somalia today . Britain will spend a further £120million on aid to war-torn Somalia after ministers agreed to back a three-year European Union reconstruction plan. Brussels is providing £545million for a scheme designed to bolster security and build an inclusive political system. The UK will contribute £70million. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said Brussels would give 650million euros - around £545million. Around one eighth of this - £70million - will be paid for by UK taxpayers. Separately, International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced a further £50million to treat 8,400 children for malnutrition and provide life-saving immunisations for 5,300 babies. It brings the total amount of money given to Somalia since 2008 by the European Union (EU) to £1.2 billion. Half of the £50million announced by Ms Greening will go towards boosting Somalia's economic development by supporting the country's recovery plan. It will include investment in infrastructure, sanitation, agriculture and jobs. Today, Ms Greening said: 'Britain is already forging a new and special relationship with Somalia. 'It is right that we help Somalia to get back on its feet and stop the country falling back into the arms of terrorism, famine and insecurity. 'This new roadmap for reconstruction is a once in a generation opportunity to support Somalia's plans for a safer and more prosperous future. 'We must give ordinary Somalis the support they need to make this a reality.' Aid: The money will be used to treat thousands of malnourished Somali children, the Department for International Development (DfID) have said . It comes just weeks after it emerged that £480,000 of British aid and supplies to Somalia was confiscated by al-Qaeda terrorists in the country. Oxfam’s head of policy Max Lawson welcomed the extra cash, but said governments should be doing more not to close bank accounts that allow Somalis to send money from abroad worth a quarter of the country’s economy - and dwarfing the amount of foreign aid. Somalia was plunged into decades of lawlessness after the overthrow of President Siad Barre in 1991. Militant group Al-Shabab is currently fighting to remove Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud's government - the first to be recognised by the US in more than 20 years. The group controls most of the southern part of the country. However, it has been driven out of the main cities and towns - including the capital Mogadishu - by an African Union (AU) force backing the government.","Britain backed an EU plan to aid Somalia, which will cost £70million .

The BBC should be split in two because it is has become too big to manage effectively, the head of Comic Relief has warned. The Chair of the charity Peter Bennett-Jones, who has worked with the corporation for 15 years on Red Nose Day, says that the sheer scale of the BBC has made it too large to manage properly. Mr Bennett-Jones, who is stepping down after 15 years as the Comic Relief Chair of Trustees, told The Times that the broadcaster should be split into two - with one organisation focusing on entertainment and another on news, similar to ITV. The BBC employs around 16,500 people - 437 of which are senior managers . He said: 'There's such tension between news, news management, and news compliance and a completely different set of rules that should apply to drama, entertainment and comedy,' The Times reported. 'The people running the BBC are from the new and factual side, but I'm more interested in the showbiz side, and by large so are most of the audience.' The BBC currently employs around 16,500 people, according to figures released for 2012/ 2013. Of these, 437 people are classed as senior management, with salaries ranging from 'under £70,000' a year to 'between £370,000 to £399,999'. The BBC refused to respond to the comments. Peter Bennett-Jones says the broadcaster should be split into separate news and entertainment organisations . Recently the corporation's management as come under intense scrutiny from Parliament, after MPs grilled them about who signed off huge pay-outs to senior managers last week. The Public Accounts Committee questioning exposed a bitter BBC civil war as Mark Thompson, Lord Patten and other serving and former executives sought to shift the blame over who knew about over-generous pay-offs to managers. During almost three hours of furious questioning in Parliament, former Director-General Mr Thompson and BBC Trust Lord Patten repeatedly contradicted each other, notably over a £1million settlement for ex-deputy Director-General Mark Byford. Mr Thompson insisted he told the BBC Trust about the details of the pay-offs. But sitting just feet away, BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten hit back, saying he was repeatedly told the huge deal for Mr Byford was 'contractual' and 'standard'. The MPs questioning exposed a bitter BBC civil war as Mark Thompson, Lord Patten and other serving and former executives sought to shift the blame over who knew about over-generous pay-offs to managers . Cheers rang out in the BBC newsroom as the corporation's personnel chief Lucy Adams was branded a liar by committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge, who is investigating the staggering pay offs. Mr Bennett-Jones comments on management follow the revelation that the a number of senior BBC executives on six-figure salaries are juggling extra business interests. Now a powerful Commons committee is to probe the 'second jobs  culture' at the top of the BBC after The Mail on Sunday uncovered how senior executives are running thriving businesses on the side. One manager, earning £207,000 a year, has found the time to establish a cafe business. Another £175,000-a-year director also runs a consumer electronic business, while the £131,000-year-head of the director-general’s office works as a director of the London Ambulance Service. John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, said he was planning to grill BBC Chairman Chris Patten and Director-General Tony Hall over the issue when they appear before MPs next month. He also said that he was going to launch a ‘substantial’ inquiry into the BBC to look at ‘root and branch reforms’, including whether the licence fee should be scrapped. Mr Whittingdale’s move comes against the backdrop of growing outrage over high pay and extravagant pay-offs at the Corporation, and an increasingly toxic relationship between the Government and the BBC. Mr Bennett-Jones will be handing over the reins in September this year to newly appointed Chair Designate, Tim Davie, Chief Executive of BBC Worldwide and Director, Global. His comments follow a difficult year for the the corporation, which has been plagued with scandal and in-fighting.","Comic Relief chair Peter Bennett-Jones says corporation is too big .

It was far from a traditional wedding ceremony when Helen Morfitt and Felix Laws tied the knot. Mainly because the groom used to be a woman and the bride used to be a man. And when the pair said 'I do' last Friday, they became the first couple to have a sex swap marriage in Britain. Sex swap marriage: Felix Laws and Helen Morfitt became Mr and Mrs Fenlon after tying the knot in Gretna Green . Happily married: The pair invited 13 people who had given them the most support to the ceremony . Both Helen and Felix have gone through . sex change procedures and became Britain's first double sex swap married . couple when they tied the knot on Gretna Green, Scotland. They both had their reassignment operations on September 13 - Helen in 2003 and Felix in 2010 - so thought it would be fitting as the date for their wedding. The couple, who have been together for six years. were forced to change gender on their birth certificates before they could elope. Before: Felix, who was a woman called Katy and was pregnant at the time of this photo (left) while Helen's old passport photo shows the facial hair she had when she was a man called Leslie (right) Helen, 56, who was a man known as . Leslie, and teaching assistant Felix, 46, once Katy, have suffered four . broken marriages between them and have 10 children. But after years of suffering Helen told the Sunday Mirror the wedding was perfect and the dress had been something she dreamt about as a little girl. She said: 'I had butterflies during the service and I thought my knees would buckle under me.' And Felix, 46, who wore a kilt, admitted he was almost knocked off his feet when he saw the bride approaching the altar. 'I will love Helen forever. When I saw her coming down the aisle, I just thought 'Wow'. She looked incredible.' The pair met in 2008 after Felix confessed to his doctor that he was trapped in the wrong body. From the age of eight, he knew he wanted to become a man. As Katy, he got married at 22 and had two sons - but walked out after 13 years leaving his children behind. When he left his husband, he strapped down his 38F breasts so he could feel better about himself. Felix's GP then sent him to a psychologist after hearing his story, who then put him in touch with transgender support group run by Helen. A support worker at Lincoln University, Helen was born a man called Leslie Morfitt. She got married three times and fathered eight children . While she was growing up, she had always wanted to be a girl, but her father's position in the military made it tough for her to change gender. Despite trying to suppress the urges, she cross-dressed in secret and, in the end, she opted for gender-reassignment treatment after the stress became too overwhelming. Helen's son Darren walked her down the aisle while Felix shook with nerves as he placed the ring on her finger. The couple, from Hull, chose just 13 people who have given them the most support to attend the ceremony. Close friends Natalie Wellings, 25, and Anna Dinsdale, 49, were chosen as bridesmaids while Matthew Lewis, 40, was best man. Helen and Felix say the most difficult part of their transitions was telling their children. Helen, told her two youngest children when they were only five and six years old, explaining that she was ill and could only get better if she became a woman. She said: 'The six-year-old was super cute and asked me if she could start calling me Helen instead of daddy.' Her other two girls and four boys have slowly come around to the idea of the wedding. Felix became estranged from one of his sons after the sex change, but his other son Kieran, 20, was there to watch him tie the knot.","Helen and Felix Fenlon met six years ago at a transgender support group .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 00:16 EST, 16 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:20 EST, 16 September 2013 . Former Treasury secretary and senior White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers, who was considered the leading candidate to succeed Ben Bernanke as Federal Reserve chairman, has withdrawn from consideration, the White House announced Sunday. Summers' withdrawal followed growing resistance from critics, including some members of the Senate committee that would need to back his nomination. A letter signed by 350 economists last week calling on President Barack Obama to nominate Federal . Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen to be the Fed's next chairman was designed to draw attention back to Yellen amid signs that . Obama was leaning toward nominating his former economic adviser Summers. Top choice: U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Janet Yellen speaking at a international monetary conference in Shanghai in June . If chosen by President . Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate, Yellen will become the first . woman to lead the Fed. In the past, Obama has mentioned only one . other candidate as possibly being under consideration: Donald Kohn, a . former Fed vice chair. But Kohn, 70, has been considered a long shot. The . administration also reached out to former Treasury Secretary Timothy . Geithner early in the process. Geithner said he was not interested in . being considered. Obama is expected to announce a nominee for the Fed chairmanship as early as this month. Bernanke's term ends January 31, 2014. Some economists said Sunday that they think Summers' exit significantly boosts the likelihood of a Yellen nomination. 'The . odds that the president will nominate Janet Yellen are now much . higher,' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Still, Zandi added, 'There is a chance that there is some dark horse candidate, possibly Tim Geithner.' David . Jones, chief economist at DMJ Advisors and the author of several books . on the Fed, said he saw Yellen's selection as a virtual certainty. 'There . is a strong view that making a woman Fed chair is an important step,' Jones said. 'There is no question that her experience qualifies her for . the role.' Summers and his allies had been engaged in an . unusually public contest with Yellen supporters, with each side lobbying . the administration. Competition: Larry Summers has been hotly tipped for the role as Federal Reserve Chairman but his candidature has been accompanied by strong criticism of his record in the Bill Clinton era . An openly waged succession battle is . something that the Fed, which will turn 100 in December, has never . before witnessed. The selection of a chairman has long been a matter . handled privately by a president and his senior advisers. In a statement Sunday, Obama said he had accepted Summers' decision. 'Larry . was a critical member of my team as we faced down the worst economic . crisis since the Great Depression, and it was in no small part because . of his expertise, wisdom and leadership that we wrestled the economy . back to growth and made the kind of progress we are seeing today,' Obama . said. As director of the National Economic Council, Summers . oversaw the administration's response to the economic and financial . crisis early in Obama's first term. Yet Summers faced strenuous . opposition from some Democrats, including some on the Senate Banking . Committee. Summers alluded to that opposition in a letter he sent Sunday . to Obama to formally withdraw from consideration. 'I have . reluctantly concluded that any possible confirmation process for me . would be acrimonious and would not serve the interests of the Federal . Reserve, the administration or ultimately, the interests of the nation's . ongoing economic recovery,' Summers wrote. Summers' ascent to . the top of the list to succeed Bernanke rankled both opponents of the . president as well as some liberal supporters. He has alienated . colleagues in the past with a brusque and at times domineering style. Unlike Bernanke, he's not been known as a consensus-builder — one reason . some critics had opposed his nomination. He was also seen as . having been too cozy with Wall Street. And Summers was roundly . criticized for questioning women's innate skills in math and science - . comments that contributed to his forced resignation as Harvard's . president in 2006. Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of the women's . rights group UltraViolet, welcomed Summers' withdrawal, saying she hopes . it serves as 'a reminder to all that sexism has no place anywhere in . society and certainly not in the highest levels of our government. Thomas . called on Obama to nominate Yellen, 67, who has been closely aligned . with Bernanke and has helped devise the Fed's low-interest rates . policies. Since joining the Fed's board as vice chair in 2010, . Yellen has supported Bernanke's use of not only the Fed's traditional . tool of short-term interest rates but also non-traditional tools . designed to help the economy. These include bond purchases and guidance . to investors about the likely direction of rates. Time up: Current Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's term is up in January . As early as . this week, the Fed is expected to scale back its $85 billion-a-month in . Treasury and mortgage bond purchases. Those purchases have been designed . to keep long-term loan rates low to get people to borrow and spend and . invest in the stock market. The low rates are credited with . helping fuel a housing comeback, support economic growth, drive stocks . to record highs and restore the wealth of many Americans. Yellen . has long been considered a top candidate for the chairmanship in part . because of her expertise as an economist, her background as a top bank . regulator and her experience as vice chair. Last week, more than . 350 economists signed a letter to Obama calling on him to nominate . Yellen. The letter was designed to draw attention back to Yellen amid . signs that Obama was leaning toward Summers. The letter, whose . signers include economists with ties to Obama, credited Yellen for . prescience in warning in 2005 about the impending mortgage meltdown, for . her consensus style of leadership and for her commitment to job growth. Outside chance: According to sources, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is not interested in being the next head the Federal Reserve . Liberal . critics of Summers had focused in particular on the role he played in . deregulating parts of the financial industry during the Clinton . administration. More than 20 Democratic senators this summer . signed a letter to Obama expressing support for Yellen. The letter was . circulated by Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, a member of the Banking . Committee. Last week, another committee Democrat, Jon Tester of . Montana, announced he would oppose Summers. Aides to Brown and to Senator . Jeff Merkley of Oregon, also on the committee, indicated that their . bosses intended to oppose Summers, too. That meant Summers would have to win support from Republicans on the committee, a tough challenge. Still, . a Yellen nomination would likely face resistance from many Republicans. Critics argue that the Fed's low-rate policies have raised the risk of . high inflation and dangerous bubbles in assets like real estate and . stocks. Yellen is seen as a leading architect of those policies. Obama had vigorously defended Summers in recent weeks, both in public comments and in closed-door meetings with lawmakers. 'I . will always be grateful to Larry for his tireless work and service on . behalf of his country, and I look forward to continuing to seek his . guidance and counsel in the future,' Obama said Sunday.","Former Treasury secretary Larry Summers has withdrawn his candidacy for Federal Reserve chairman .

"By . Sir Thomas Hughes-hallett . PUBLISHED: . 18:16 EST, 14 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:01 EST, 16 September 2013 . The NHS that has served us so well for 60 years is in crisis. The current model is no longer sustainable. We are living longer and that means our bodies become harder to maintain. Many of us who are 60 now will die with at least three different conditions – and the State simply does not have the money to cope. At the current rate of growth, spending on healthcare will rise from 8.2 per cent of GDP to 20 per cent over the coming years unless action is taken. Former chief executive of Marie Curie, Sir Thomas Hughes-Hallett has said the NHS is no longer suited to our aging population . We think of free healthcare as our national birthright – but how much do we really need? The  brutal answer has to be: a lot less. The NHS will be fundamentally threatened unless non-essential services become the responsibility of communities, charities  and individuals – and unless people are prepared to pay for some of them. I have just spent nine months talking to people in Essex about their care and its future. Their need is great – the number of people needing social care in Essex will grow from 35,000 now to 137,500 by 2030. And what they told me was astounding. In Pitsea, I was told: ‘It is the individual who is responsible for their own health – not the Government.’ In Braintree, a young mother couldn’t understand why the State funds her maternity care when she made a choice to get pregnant – yet doesn’t fund the care of her elderly next-door neighbour. In Clacton-on-Sea, people told me that they would rather see their local hospital closed and the money reinvested in community services. First port of call: People should make better use of their local pharmacies says Sir Hughes-Hallett . As an experiment we gave two representative groups of 50 people £3.5 billion in virtual money to spend on health and social care, and they did something extraordinary. They cut spending on hospitals, drugs and services offered by GPs – and reallocated funds to support community services and pharmacies. Why pharmacies? Because they’re convenient and often open when surgeries are not. A staggering 40 per cent of people in Basildon and Braintree use the pharmacy (or Google) as their first port of call. In Benfleet they didn’t ‘have a  clue’ where to get help. A carer in Chelmsford told me that he had  a bewildering choice of 28 local  organisations and charities offering support. And children in Chelmsford offered to give up an episode of EastEnders each week to have time to care for an elderly lady in their street. These good people of Essex have one thing in common. They want to take back control of their own health. They just need the support of the State to do so. I have briefed ministers, NHS England and the Department of Health, because what we’ve learned from the process will have national implications. And the reaction has been very positive, at the highest level. So by 2016 if you live in Essex and are worried, say, by a recurring back pain, you will be able to . . . l Use a health ‘TripAdvisor’ and ‘satnav’ to find the best help, which might be from the chemist and not the GP. l Ask someone in your community  to drive you to the GP – who will  now offer care that you used to get only at A&E. l Know that if you think you need a  massage, and it is not a clinical  necessity, the State will not provide it – but your neighbour might. l Pay to receive immediate non-urgent care. l Talk to your ‘buddy’ if you’re vul-nerable. l Accept that if you go to A&E unnecessarily, you are depriving someone else of urgent care. In all my years working with patients  – 12 of them with Marie Curie Cancer Care and after that with Lord Darzi at the Institute of Global Health Innovation – I have never heard more compelling arguments for change articulated by the very people who will be most affected by it. A new partnership at a local level between citizens and those who currently provide their care is the best solution to the impending crisis. 1. A new understanding between the public sector and the people . . . I . will take responsibility for my own health – you, the State, will help . me to do so. You will give me access to a health ‘TripAdvisor’ – where I . can find the best care – and a health ‘satnav’ that tells me how I can . access these services. Don’t assume I’m not  prepared to pay for some of . these – I pay for repairs to my car, so why not to my body?In return, you will give more support and recognition to my informal carer.And you will always be there for me in a crisis – 24/7. 2.

Hannah Groves hanged herself after suffering from panic attacks and being dismissed by a social worker . A troubled student killed herself after a social worker dismissed her as ‘an effing waste of space’ and ‘an attention seeker’. Now a coroner has formally criticised the ‘failure’ of the NHS team supposed to be caring for tragic Hannah Groves, 20, who committed suicide after she spent nine days threatening to take her own life and asking to be admitted to a specialist unit. Her frightened mother Mandy Park, 43, who made similar unsuccessful efforts to secure help for her daughter, said: ‘If she had been admitted for treatment I believe Hannah would still be alive. ‘I feel completely and utterly failed by the lack of help and care. 'She was talked about in such a vile, horrific and derogatory way by certain people. 'It was like being caught up in a horror film.’ Her complaints were backed up by the evidence at the inquest into Hannah’s death, which heard that Accident and Emergency doctors, police and paramedics all concluded she needed help. But the specialist mental health team diagnosed her as simply having ‘attention-seeking behaviour’. In a narrative verdict, Southampton coroner Keith Wiseman said: ‘There was at all stages a failure to appreciate the extent of the risk that Hannah was at in the community.’ Hannah was studying French at the university of Southampton when she began suffering mental illness for the first time. On an October morning last year – after she had spent nine days repeatedly asking for treatment in the city’s Antelope House mental health unit – she was being assessed at a police station when a policeman phoned the mental health team. It was then that a social worker told the officer: ‘Yeah, I know her, she is an effing waste of space, she’s an attention seeker.’ Within three hours Hannah was dead after strangling herself with scarves and belts. Now her mother has told how her daughter’s mental state swiftly degenerated into severe panic attacks and she had to be prevented from strangling herself. Miss Park said: ‘It was like she was possessed but we just couldn’t get the help that she needed and she wanted. ‘The image of finding my daughter will haunt me for ever and I can no longer sleep at night without heavy medication.’ Yet Miss Park said that when she called the psychiatric team on her daughter’s behalf, she was ‘treated as if I was a pain’. She added: ‘I could hear the sighs on the phone when I told them who I was.’ Hannah's mother Mandy Park (pictured right) has said she will never recover from finding her daughter's body and is now taking medication to deal with the trauma . Coroner Mr Wiseman said in his verdict earlier this month: ‘It is surely self-evident that by the end of the week it was unsafe for both Hannah and her family for her to be at home. ‘One only has to pause for a moment to visualise Hannah’s mother and teenage brother being forced to leave the house for their own safety in the early hours of the morning and for the police to have to be called, to realise that by then a wholly impossible stage had been reached and that for however modest a period of time Hannah required hospital admission and care.’ He went on to say that a ‘safety first’ policy had clearly not been employed, particularly in light of Hannah’s clearly worsening condition. She needed immediate help, he said, ‘not the almost throwaway line of: well she can always come to see us when she wants to’. Hannah’s mother said she was now taking legal action against the Southern Health NHS Trust. A spokesman for the Trust rejected her family’s and the coroner’s claims that she should have been admitted to hospital, but said: ‘In this case we deeply regret the failure to provide the right level of intensive community support which would have avoided any need for hospital admission.’ The social worker who made the ‘waste of space’ comment had been suspended while an investigation is carried out.","Twenty-year-old started suffering from panic attacks at University .

UPDATED: . 05:50 EST, 17 September 2013 . the day before Powell was arrested in July last year he sent text messages simultaneously to three women asking for sex . A predatory police constable who had intercourse with a victim of domestic violence while on duty was jailed for 15 months today. Jordan Powell, 31, would call at the woman’s home in the middle of the night while he was on duty to have sex with her. Powell, a married father of two with West Mercia Police, had a 'large sexual appetite', which led him to repeatedly cheat on his wife. The day before Powell was arrested in July last year he sent - as he arrived at work - text messages simultaneously to three women asking for sex, Gloucester Crown Court heard. Powell was caught when his own force became suspicious and set a trap using an undercover female officer. The officer, known only as Roxy, pretended to be a victim of domestic violence and rang police in June last year for assistance. Powell was dispatched to her home - fitted with covert recording equipment - to investigate her complaint. Within a couple of hours of leaving Roxy’s home in Kidderminster, Powell had sent her flirtatious text messages from his personal mobile phone, the court heard. Powell sent text messages containing kisses and flirtatious comments, asking whether Roxy had a 'smile on that pretty face'. The conversation then became more sexual, prosecutor Sarah Regan said. Powell, who joined West Mercia Police in 2004, received a warning for gross misconduct in 2008 for having sex while on duty with a victim of crime. Miss Regan said that in May last year Powell attended the home of a woman who was making a complaint about a breach of a non-molestation order by her husband. PC Jordan Powell, who covered up as he arrived at Gloucester Crown Court, sent text messages containing kisses and flirtatious comments . Over the following days he sent her a string of suggestive text messages from his personal mobile phone. Miss Regan said that six days after Powell had first taken her statement, they slept together for the first time. Powell sent the woman one text, which read: 'Let me come round now. Got 15 minutes. You want me inside you now.' She replied: 'You are so naughty. On duty as well.' The court heard that the woman’s self-confidence has been left 'shattered' by Powell’s actions. 'He has in my eyes behaved even more appallingly than my husband,' the woman said in a statement. 'He has abused his position as a police officer.' Powell, of Tipton, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to three charges of misconduct in a public office between May and July 2012 . Powell, of Tipton, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to three charges of misconduct in a public office between May and July 2012. Three other similar charges against a third woman and an allegation of sexual assault - that Powell used a pen to expose a fourth woman’s breasts when he took her statement - were ordered to lie on file. Kevin Baumber, defending, said Powell’s wife, who was in court, was standing by him despite his numerous affairs. 'He had a large sexual appetite which is something he has recognised and addressed since,' Mr Baumber said. 'He has recognised there is something wrong with his sexual appetite and has started counselling. 'He has reflected upon his own behaviour and is determined to change. There will not be a repeat of his behaviour. 'He offers an apology.' Assistant Chief Constable Gareth . Morgan said today: 'This officer acted in an unforgivable way and abused . his role and the position of trust that he had been given. 'He has exploited his role and targeted vulnerable women for his own personal gratification. 'On . behalf of West Mercia Police, I would like to apologise to the women . involved and pay tribute to their strength and bravery throughout this . investigation. 'I am proud . to say the vast majority of our workforce are honest, hard-working . individuals who are dedicated to serving our local communities. 'When . a police officer acts in such a despicable way, it makes it harder for . the public to maintain their trust in us and damages the good relations . we have. 'I would like to . thank our professional standards department - whose investigation was . supervised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission - for their . hard work in bringing this officer to justice. This was a complex . investigation involving a number of lines of inquiry. 'This . investigation, culminating in today’s sentence, underlines the fact . that West Mercia Police will not tolerate the tiny minority of dishonest . staff or officers who give others a bad name.' Mr Baumber described the university business graduate as a 'kind and attentive father'. 'In . his role as a police officer he has always been hard-working. He had . before these matters been held in high regard and passed his sergeants . exam,' Mr Baumber added. Jailing Powell, Judge Jamie Tabor QC said his offending had 'undermined public confidence' in the police. 'It . is vital that law-abiding members of the public feel they can trust . those that are empowered to protect them,' the judge told him. 'You were preying on those in society who you were paid to protect. This is a course of conduct over a considerable period of time. 'Your sexual appetite was certainly out of control. Your behaviour has undermined the confidence the public holds in the police. 'Police officers who breach that trust and take advantage of vulnerable people are acting contrary to the oath they took.' Judge Tabor said that Powell, whom he described as a sexual predator, had not changed his ways even after receiving a warning five years ago and said it was fortunate for him that his court was 'not a court of morals'. 'You have not curtailed your sexual behaviour at all. You are an intelligent man who must have known what you were doing was committing criminal offences,' he said. 'When a complaint was made, your superiors decided to set a trap for you. You had not chosen Roxy as a victim but when the opportunity presented itself you couldn’t resist. 'Such behaviour undermines public confidence. 'Your behaviour has been predatory but you didn’t go out looking for victims but rather waited for them.' West Mercia Police said Powell, who had been suspended from duty following his arrest, would face a misconduct hearing. The court heard that last month Powell wrote to formally tender his resignation but the deputy chief constable rejected it.","Jordan Powell would visit woman's home while on duty to have sex with her .

A Labour MP has called for the abolition of the British arms industry. Fabian Hamilton said he does not approve of selling weapons abroad and would like to see the multi- billion-pound sector closed down. The outburst provoked ridicule last night, not least because defence manufacturers supply much of the kit used by the British Armed Forces as well as employing about 300,000 people across the country. Mr Hamilton made his comments during a phone-in programme on BBC Radio 5 Live yesterday. The MP for Leeds North East told listeners: ‘I frankly think we have no business exporting weapons.’ Programme host Nicky Campbell then asked Mr Hamilton: ‘Would you like to phase it out and close it down?’ Mr Hamilton replied: ‘I think I would like to.’ The UK has the second-most lucrative defence industry in the world, after the United States, with exports worth £11.4billion last year. It is calculated that one tenth of all British manufacturing is in the defence sector, with more than 9,000 companies. Tory MP Jack Lopresti said: ‘Labour left us with terrible unemployment; now they want to send another 300,000 Brits to the dole queues. ‘If [Labour leader] Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up for British defence and manufacturing, then he’s too weak to run the country.’ Money maker: The UK's defence industry employs hundreds of thousands of people and its exports netted £11.4billion last year . Last night, Labour sought to distance itself from Mr Hamilton’s suggestion. A spokesman said: ‘This is not Labour Party policy. 'We are committed to a strong defence industry which serves our Armed Forces with world-class kit as well as providing high-skilled jobs for thousands. ‘The defence industry is absolutely vital and uniquely placed to both protect and promote our country.’","Labour's Fabian Hamilton wants to end UK arms production and sales .

"PUBLISHED: . 12:35 EST, 15 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:57 EST, 16 September 2013 . Police have launched an investigation into claims that a woman who was held at an immigration removal centre was subject to inappropriate sexual behaviour from guards. The 23-year-old woman alleges she had sexual contact with male guards at Yarl's Wood in Bedfordshire, which her lawyer said could amount to misconduct in public office. Harriet Wistrich of law firm Birnberg Peirce urged the Government to investigate and said consent could be an issue in the matter. The 23-year-old woman alleges she had sexual contact with male guards at Yarl's Wood in Bedfordshire . Ms Wistrich said the alleged case, involving a Roma woman who was released from the centre last March, was not an isolated one. 'The Government needs to look at what the hell is going on at Yarl's Wood, that this could happen in such a widespread abuse,' she said. 'It's not a one-off. They need to investigate the whole system there, because it has not worked.' She said the issue was whether individuals being detained at the centre were capable of giving consent, adding: 'The problem is that it is not an environment where they are making free choices at all. 'If an officer conducts himself way outside the permitted rules of behaviour, that may amount to another offence of misconduct in public office, whether it was consensual or not, even if it is not an assault. Ms Wistrich described the women at the centre as highly vulnerable, and said: 'These women are generally quite scared to come forward, and often they have moved or been deported before they are able to say anything. How widespread it is is difficult to know.' Serco, which runs the centre, has denied there is a widespread issue at Yarl's Wood . She added: 'This is precisely the kind of case the Government says they are gong to remove legal aid from. It is a classic example of the Government saying they are saving money but actually, they're removing challenges to the abuse of state powers.' Serco, which runs the centre, has denied there is a widespread issue at Yarl's Wood. John Tolland, Serco's director at the 400-bed centre near Clapham, Bedfordshire, said: 'Serco absolutely refutes the allegations made that there is an environment at Yarl's Wood where sexual intimidation or inappropriate behaviour is in any way tolerated. 'We have strict procedures for dealing with any such complaints and they are always fully investigated. 'We expect the highest standards of behaviour from all our staff and any claims of misconduct are treated extremely seriously. On the occasion when an complaint of sexually inappropriate behaviour between staff and a resident was brought to our attention in 2012 the matter was properly investigated and the police were kept fully informed throughout. As a result three members of staff were dismissed.' A Bedfordshire Police spokeswoman said: 'We received a report at the end of August from a third party. No one has been arrested in connection with this investigation, but the investigation is ongoing.' Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper described the allegations as 'extremely serious and disturbing'. She said: 'A full and thorough investigation into these specific charges of abuse must be undertaken by the police and the Home Office immediately and testimony taken from all involved. This kind of alleged abuse is a serious criminal offence and should be treated as such. 'The Home Office needs to tell us whether and how long it has known of these allegations and what action it has taken to bring the police in. 'And the independent UKBA inspectorate needs to review urgently the operation of outsourced centres run by private contractors such as Serco and look at the handling of allegations of abuse. 'Staff are supposed to be trained to identify if people may have been trafficked or subject to abuse so they can be given support and help. That's why allegations that staff have themselves perpetuated abuse are so disturbing, and why it is so important to get to the truth.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'We take the welfare of our detainees very seriously. Detention and removal are essential parts of effective immigration controls, but it is vital that these are carried out with humanity and dignity, and we are committed to ensuring that this is the case. 'We expect contractors to maintain the highest standards. Any allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated and, if necessary, they will be reported to the appropriate authorities, including the police. 'We operate a comprehensive complaints system for detainees who feel that they have not been treated in accordance with our published operating standards.'","The 23-year-old woman alleges she had sexual contact with male guards at Yarl's Wood in Bedfordshire .

Shocked: Gary O'Donnell's children Dylan, 18, and Cayleigh, 21, want his medals kept in the family . The ex-wife and children of an Army bomb disposal expert killed in Afghanistan have accused his widow of cashing in on his bravery medals. Toni O’Donnell, 44, said she had no choice but to sell the honours awarded to her late husband Gary so she could help provide for the children he left behind. But the two children from his first marriage – and their mother, Karen O’Donnell – said yesterday they had known nothing of the sale and claimed that Toni was a ‘wealthy’ woman who enjoyed many holidays, had two houses, a BMW and even a hot tub. Speaking as she and her brother Dylan raised money for Help For Heroes charity at the weekend, Cayleigh O’Donnell, 21, said she would ‘live on the streets’ before she would even think about selling the medals her father earned saving countless lives. And she said that she ‘highly doubted’ her stepmother needed the money. ‘We were heartbroken to hear the news of the sale,’ she said. ‘The last thing I would ever think to do in my life would be to sell my dad’s medals. I want the medals in the family, I don’t want some stranger to have them.’ Warrant Officer O’Donnell, 40, became the first serviceman in nearly 30 years to be awarded the George Medal twice after saving countless lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. But in September 2008, before the announcement of his second award was made, he was blown up when a booby-trapped device exploded as he tried to clear a path for his comrades. Cayleigh said the medals were the only thing the family had left to remind them of their father’s bravery. ‘He worked so hard, he was so good at his job and all that is left now is his medals to show how amazing he was and they are going to be pawned off to the highest bidder,’ she said. Selling up: Second wife Toni - she has two young children from her marriage to Warrant Officer O'Donnell . The family claimed Toni O’Donnell, who has two young children from her marriage to Warrant Officer O’Donnell, had bragged about her luxury lifestyle on Facebook, which included numerous holidays each year, and couldn’t possibly need the money so desperately. ‘She posted on Facebook how she needed another holiday to get over the holiday and couldn’t imagine the amount of miles she had flown,’ said Cayleigh. ‘They’ve gone to at least three or four places each year – to Lapland for Christmas, Spain and Greece. ‘I highly doubt she needed the money, the Army helped out so much. She had a BMW, a caravan, hot tub, a couple of houses – she got an extension put on the house she had with my dad. That is not someone in need of money.’ The story in Friday's Daily Mail . Karen O’Donnell, 50, said she had remained on amicable terms with her former husband after their seven-year marriage ended. Warrant Officer O’Donnell married Toni in 1997 and they had two children – Aidan and Ben, who was just eight weeks old when his father died. Karen said she learned of the medal sale by reading of it in the newspapers. ‘Both my children feel it is not her place to sell them,’ she said. ‘We don’t see any financial hardship.’ It is believed that Toni O’Donnell, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, has since sold her BMW and the caravan and bought a cheaper car. Wedding day: Gary with first wife Karen . She said of the medals: ‘They are up for auction and I have my own reasons. End of. I have two young children to provide for. It’s nobody else’s business.’ The heroism of bomb disposal experts such as Warrant Officer O’Donnell was captured in the Oscar-winning film The Hurt Locker. His first honour came in 2006 for ‘persistent courage’ in Iraq and the second award was made for two incidents in Afghanistan. The medals are expected to fetch £60,000. Cayleigh, from South Lanarkshire, said the family was now desperately trying to raise the money to buy them. Dylan, 18, said: ‘We would have cherished my dad’s medals because we know how proud he was when he got the first George Medal. ‘It was a huge achievement for anyone and if he was still alive I know he wouldn’t have sold it for the world – and neither would we.’","Warrant Officer O’Donnell, 40, became first serviceman in 30 years to be awarded the George Medal twice .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . PUBLISHED: . 12:46 EST, 16 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:27 EST, 16 September 2013 . If you think parking your car is getting harder, you’re right – and it’s probably not your fault. While parking spaces have stayed the same size for 20 years, cars have widened by around 16 per cent – making the average modern model two inches broader than the legal minimum space. And the squeeze is costing motorists an annual £500million in repairs to their paintwork. The size of the average car has grown as manufacturers strive to offer more interior space, comfort and often mandatory crash protection . As car park owners fit in as many minimum-size spaces as they can, more than ten million drivers a year are scuffing or scratching their cars. Two thirds then have to pay more than £50 in repairs, a study from Halfords and paint-renovation experts G3 Pro has found. Car doors are the most likely part to be scraped, accounting for half of all reported damage. They are followed by bumpers (14 per cent) and wing mirrors (13 per cent). Yet Transport Department rules on the minimum size of parking spaces – at 5ft 11in (1.80m) – have not changed since 1994 and local council guidelines on off-street parking go back to the 1980s. Meanwhile, car manufacturers are trying to offer more interior space and comfort to drivers who are simultaneously getting taller and fatter. Manufacturers have also needed more space to comply with EU safety standards. They say this entails changing the shape of the bonnet and the panels to create a crumple-zone as well as reinforcing the superstructure and adding more weight. Some popular models have increased in width by as much as a quarter over the past 25 years. The latest generation of the popular compact BMW 3 series – at just over 5ft 11 wide with its wing-mirrors folded – is wider than the minimum parking space and eight inches broader than the 1975 original. A BMW spokesman said: 'The original 3 series of the 1970s and 80s is about the same size as today’s smaller 1 series.' The newest Volkswagen Golf – at 1799mm (5ft 11) – is now only a single millimetre narrower than the official minimum space, while the 1974 original had a width of around 5ft 2in (1587mm) and so had more than eight inches to spare. Even the latest compact Ford Focus – at around 6ft 1in with its wing-mirrors folded – is more than two inches wider than the official minimum. When it comes to a parking squeeze, experts say supermarkets were reported as the worst offenders followed by shopping centres . Critics say local authorities are making the spaces as tight as they are legally able and that the squeeze is causing strains and back injuries to motorists struggling to get out of tight and cramped spaces. The Halfords research found supermarkets were regarded as the worst offenders, with 38 per cent of drivers saying the spaces were too small, followed by shopping centres (29 per cent) and railway stations (18 per cent). Halfords paint protection expert David Howells said: ‘The majority of drivers blamed their scratches on inconsiderate drivers parking too close to them, but our research shows that the size of parking spaces is leaving them little choice.' Car doors are the biggest area to suffer scrapes as hemmed in drivers struggle to get out of their vehicles, followed by bumpers (stock photo) - but drivers have also got bigger over the years . Donna Howard from G3 Pro said: 'Even the smallest scratch can be very annoying and reduce the value of a vehicle by hundreds of pounds. 'But with car park operators looking to maximise visitor volumes and revenue, there is little incentive for them to exceed the recommended minimum size requirements.' A spokesman for car manufacturers said that although cars had increased in size, parking sensors and power steering meant they were easier to manoeuvre into narrow spaces.","More than 10million car owners have suffered annoying scuffs or scratches due to clashes in car parks .

As his hair blew in the wind, onlookers spotted was more than a little grey. He appeared unworried that middle-aged men who take up jogging risk destroying their hip and knee joints and placing a tremendous strain on their heart and lungs. The PM was thought to have given up running after suffering from knee pain, but is understood to have received treatment over the summer. Aging: Mr Cameron has in recent weeks admitted to needing glasses and complained of a 'phenomenally bad back' In August he also revealed he was suffering from a ‘phenomenally bad back’. The pain forced him to abandon plans to go deerstalking while on holiday on the Scottish island of Jura. A scan showed that he had a ‘protruding disc’ and recived treatment from Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre. Mr Cameron revealed a doctor had told him his back was otherwise in ‘good nick’. Last week the Prime Minister had to bow to a combination of growing old and the pressures of his job and also admit he now needs glasses.

Allowed to roam: Adam Swellings, 19, was on bail for assault when he murdered a father-of-three in 2007 . One in seven murders in Britain is committed by suspects freed on bail while awaiting trial for other crimes, according to disturbing new figures. Last year 56 murders – more than one a week and a shocking 37 per cent rise on 2011 – were carried out by people bailed by the courts. If they had been remanded in  custody, the victims’ lives may have been saved. Criminals on bail also committed an average of two rapes a week, and were responsible for tens of thousands of less serious offences, the Ministry of Justice figures reveal. Overall, suspects who have been released by the courts commit a crime every ten minutes. There has been pressure on magistrates in recent years to remand fewer suspects to Britain’s over-crowded prisons, but these figures suggest that too many dangerous criminals are being released. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank said: ‘These figures are horrifying – victims’ families will be sickened. ‘If the authorities have let this happen through sheer incompetence then they need to scale back immediately the use of remand on bail for people suspected of serious crimes. ‘If, on the other hand, they have decided that one extra murder a week is an “acceptable” figure, it only shows how much the public is put at risk by an obsession with keeping down prisoner numbers.’ The figures say there were 60,129 crimes committed last year by people who were on bail. Of these, 42,302 were classified as indictable offences, the most serious. In addition to the convictions for murder, 16 people were convicted of manslaughter, and 684 for serious violent assaults. A total of 111 rapes were carried out by people on bail last year, as well as 166 sex offences against children and 6,372 home break-ins. One in every five burglaries is carried out by a suspect who has already been caught for something else but then released back on to the streets. In 2011, suspects on bail carried out 41 murders, 857 serious assaults, 102 rapes and 206 sex attacks on children. Free to kill: Jonathan Vass, 30, was on bail for raping his girlfriend Jane Clough, 26, when he murdered her as she left the hospital where she work, stabbing her over 70 times . Released to kill: In 2012 a total of 56 murders - a shocking 37 per cent rise on 2011 - were carried out by people due to stand trial . Former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke limited the use of prison remand – leaving thousands more offenders at large. Judges . are no longer allowed to remand people in custody if their crime will . not lead to a jail sentence if they are eventually convicted. Three years ago, Jonathan Vass, 30, murdered his ex-girlfriend while on bail for raping her. The . former bodybuilder was released by a Crown Court judge despite standing . accused of repeatedly raping nurse Jane Clough, 26, at her Blackpool . home while she was pregnant with his daughter. Former paramedic Vass launched the frenzied knife attack on Miss Clough only eight weeks before he was due to stand trial. Murdered: Father-of-three Garry Newlove was kicked to death by Adam Swellings and two others . Vass, . who stabbed her more than 70 times in the car park of the hospital . where she worked, was jailed for a minimum of 30 years in 2010 after . admitting murder. Since her death, Miss Clough’s . devastated parents have campaigned to change the law, saying their . daughter was betrayed by the justice system. They . have demanded that bail laws be changed to make it harder to grant bail . to perpetrators of domestic violence who are thought to be particularly . dangerous. The judge who granted Vass bail had been warned about the threat he posed. Last year teenager Kevyn Viner was jailed for two horrific rape attacks – the second was carried out while he was on bail for the first. Viner, 18, of Newport, South Wales, was given an 11-year sentence for raping a 25-year-old woman just days after he was released for a similar assault on a 50-year-old victim. In 2007, teenager Adam Swellings, was on bail for assault when he murdered father-of-three Garry Newlove in Cheshire. He was allowed out despite a long history of breaching court orders. One of his bail conditions was that he did not go to Warrington – the town where he killed Mr Newlove. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Dangerous offenders should always be remanded into custody while awaiting trial. 'That’s why the Government changed the law, to allow prosecutors to challenge decisions where a potentially dangerous prisoner could be bailed. ‘The overwhelming majority of people bailed do not reoffend and they are often given strict conditions such as tags and curfews.’","Last year 56 murders were carried out by people due to stand trial .

'Vindictive': Malcolm Simpson was jailed for seven years after he twice set fire to Alison Biggs' house and another neighbour's car . A ‘vindictive’ pensioner was jailed today for setting fire to his neighbour’s house after she ended their fling and refused to pay him for mowing her lawn. Malcolm Simpson, 68, who set fire to Alison Biggs’ house twice and another neighbour’s car in Maidenhead, Berkshire, was sentenced to seven years jail. Reading Crown Court heard how the former serviceman doused petrol in Ms Biggs’ kitchen on the first occasion. He then started a fire in the hallway after the property was put up for sale. The pensioner even rang his victim's mobile phone to tell her about the fire. Simpson’s extreme behaviour could have occurred after he felt Ms Biggs, aged 49 years, owed him money for several free jobs he carried out for her including mowing the lawn and fitting a shower, the prosecution said. Ms Biggs told the jury at Simpson's trial that she had ‘lost absolutely everything’ in the fires Simpson started. She told how her neighbour had been persecuting her for months in the lead up to the first blaze in October 2011. Ms Biggs said she believed Simpson had thrown cat faeces into her garden, smashed windows, deliberately played music too loud, slashed her tyres, super-glued her front door locked, cut her cable TV wires and blocked an overflow pipe. She added that she had been staying at a friend's house in the days before the fire because ‘I didn't feel safe there’. The pair had also had a brief sexual relationship but Ms Biggs refused to continue it further, the court heard. Simpson first struck on October 15, 2011 before returning again to Ms Biggs’ home next to his in on May 24 last year. A Toyota L200 pick-up truck belonging to builder and decorator Martin Bedwell, 56, was also set alight on his driveway - two doors down from Simpson’s house - on October 9, last year. Police believed the Bedwell family had shown sympathy towards Ms Biggs’ situation and had allowed builders renovating the property the use of their electricity, the judge heard. Prosecutor Jane Davies said: ‘In relation to matters today there were two complainants - one being Ms Biggs in relation to two fires and the Bedwell family. ‘I do ask for a restraining order for . an unlimited period of time, in light of the defendant’s ties with that . locality and I don’t know what his future will be when he is released . from prison. ‘It may be . that a condition of his licence is that the defendant doesn’t return to . that locality. I think it’s right that the property was owned by the . Housing Association.’ 'I didn't feel safe there': Ms Biggs, who ended a brief relationship with Simpson, said she 'lost absolutely everything' in the fires at her home (pictured centre after rebuilding), which is next door to Simpson's home (far right) Simpson was convicted of three counts of arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered, by a jury after a trial concluded on June 3. Alan Walker, defending, said: ‘Most importantly no one was injured as a result of these events. ‘On at least one occasion Mr Simpson himself rang the fire services. On another occasion he phoned Alison Biggs, the owner of the property.’ The barrister said his client had always maintained his innocence over the matter. Mr Walker said: ‘He is of ill health. He has suffered a heart attack over the last two years.' Simpson served in the Armed Forces for seven years, including two tours of Northern Ireland. Addressing . the defendant, Judge John Reddihough said: ‘It is quite plain you held a . strong grudge against your former neighbour Alison Biggs. ‘That may have been because she declined to continue a sexual relationship with you or because she had not repaid money to you. ‘Be . that as it may, it is clear that you set out to make her life a misery . and once she left her home you twice deliberately set that house on . fire, as the jury found, reckless as to whether life of persons would be . endangered. 'Wicked' campaign: At Reading Crown Court (pictured) judge John Reddihough said it was clear that Simpson held a 'strong grudge' against Ms Biggs . ‘Plainly you regularly accessed her house and, as I find, damaged the roof of it prior to the second fire no doubt seeking to exacerbate the effects of the fire you had set. You also removed property belonging to Ms Biggs from her home. As a result of those two fires considerable damage was caused and there was a financial loss that you clearly intended. So easily the lives of neighbours could have been put at risk. ‘You then deliberately set fire to a vehicle belonging to the Bedwell family. You were seen running from the scene. The vehicle was close to their house and the fire could so easily have spread and trapped the family inside with fatal consequences. ‘It is indeed fortunate they were able to leave their home. Only you know why you targeted the Bedwells in that way. It might be that they were sympathetic to Ms Biggs or you resented them for helping builders carrying out work on her former home. You will be sentenced for wickedly setting three quite separate fires and being reckless as to whether life would be endangered.’ The Judge added: ‘Only a substantial custodial sentence is appropriate for such serious, calculated and potentially life-threatening behaviour.’ 'We've had enough of him': Detective Sergeant Peter Wall said people were intimidated by Simpson (who lived in the house on the far right) and had lived in the area for 40 years . A restraining order was also made banning Simpson from making direct or indirect contact with Ms Biggs or the Bedwell family who gave evidence at the trial. Simpson looked emotionless as he was led away to begin his sentence. Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Peter Wall of Thames Valley Police said: ‘He was a vindictive individual. ‘It is quite unclear as to how the fires happened. He had ready access to accelerants - oil, petrol. We believe this individual has been terrorising neighbours for many years in that street. ‘He’s lived there for 40 years. There was very little interest from the community initially because he is obviously quite a vindictive character and people were intimidated by him. ‘Subsequently as things have gone on we have managed to gather evidence and engage with people and got more support. ‘The success of the case is down to the community saying we’ve had enough of this man now and we want to do something about him.’","Malcolm Simpson, 68, was jailed for seven years today .

Vince Cable was dismissed as 'ridiculous' today as he caved in to pressure from Nick Clegg to back the Lib Dem leader in a crunch vote on the economy. The Business Secretary had vowed to stay away from the showdown at the party conference in Glasgow, in a move seen as a challenge to Mr Clegg’s authority. Publicly Mr Clegg played down talk of a rift, but privately his allies were furious at what they saw as botched attempt by Mr Cable to woo left-wing Lib Dems unhappy with the austerity programme. Scroll down for video . Criticism: Business Secretary Vince Cable sits in the audience as delegates vote on economic policy after previously vowing to stay away . Split: Vince Cable (left) put himself at odds with the Lib Dem leadership, to the fury of those around Nick Clegg . Mr Clegg saw off the challenge to his authority as rebel amendments were overwhelmingly defeated at the party's annual conference in Glasgow. Left-wing Lib Dems wanted to commit the party to watering down the Government's deficit-reduction programme and changing the mandate of the Bank of England to encourage growth and job creation. Mr Cable - who had not been planning to vote - made an . 11th-hour change of heart and turned up in the conference hall to cast . his vote in support of Mr Clegg. An ally of the Lib Dem leader said: 'Vince now just looks f****** ridiculous. The self-indulgent act of subordination can only be done so many times.' Appeal: In an unusual move Mr Clegg spoke in the debate to persuade members to back his economic policy . Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael today admitted he is 'fine' with the idea of Nick Clegg being deeply unpopular. Almost three-quarters of people identifying themselves as Lib Dem voters in a survey by OnePoll for Daybreak said Mr Clegg was not a good leader. More than half said he should stand down before the 2015 election. But Mr Carmichael said: 'There are going to be people who don’t like us because they are Conservatives and they want the Government to be more Conservative or because they’re Labour supporters and they want it to go in the opposite direction. 'The fact of the matter is that Liberal Democrats in government every day are making a real difference. And if that makes Nick unpopular with Conservatives and Labour voters, then frankly that’s alright by me.' It was seen as an embarrassing about-face which will have damaged Mr Cable's leadership ambitions. The row dates from when the economic motion was agreed at an away day where MPs backed Mr Clegg's tough line. Today Mr Cable sat in the middle of the conference hall as Mr Clegg gave an impassioned speech urging members to back his policy. He warned delegates that victory for . the amendments would be welcomed only by Chancellor George Osborne and . his Labour shadow Ed Balls. Mr Clegg said: 'Please be careful for what you wish for. If we start messing about with the big goalposts we have stuck in the ground which frame the stability which is required for further economic growth, we will destroy jobs and decrease prosperity.' Mr Cable last night signalled that he would not back a motion supporting the Coalition’s deficit reduction plans. Mr Cable issued a statement saying there were ‘aspects’ of the motion he could not support. This was seen as a clear signal that he wants the Government to increase borrowing. It . was seen as a direct challenge to Mr Clegg, who has made a bold pitch . that the economic recovery would not be happening without Lib Dems in . government. ‘Loyalty isn’t really Vince’s thing,’ said a senior party source. This morning Mr Clegg said: ‘I don't run a boot camp, I don't determine exactly who is in which room at what time.’ Home Office minister Jeremy Browne also took a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Cable’s tendency to try to appear ‘bashful’ about being part of the coalition. Policy: The economic policy has been written by Mr Clegg and Treasury minister Danny Alexander . Speaking at a Policy Exchange fringe event, Mr Browne did not mention Mr Cable by name. But . he warned: ‘The task for us as a party is to ask ourselves are we proud . of our government or are we ashamed of it? We need to sell the purpose . of the government rather than feeling bashful about it. ‘We shouldn’t equivocate when it comes to the role we have played in the gradual national recovery. ‘If we don’t associate ourselves with those achievements, we don’t deserve to be associated with the recovery by anybody else.' Senior Lib Dem source . In a highly unusual move, Mr Clegg took  to the platform himself to urge his party to stick to the . spending plans agreed with the Tories. He saw off the challenge from left-wing activists who tabled a rebel . amendment which called for borrowing restrictions on councils to be . lifted, allowing town hall chiefs to run up deficits to pay for new . housing. Lib Dem President Tim Farron, another potential leadership challenger seen as a standard-bearer for the left, gave his fulsome support to Mr Clegg. Warning against handing over credit for the recovery to George Osborne, Mr Farron told the conference: 'What an irony: just as the economy was growing, just as our 2010 decisions were being vindicated, just as our fortunes were turning, we got the jitters and handed the credit to George Osborne. 'What an irony if just at the moment that even as Ed Balls isn't sure that he agrees with Ed Balls ... we might agree with Ed Balls.' He urged his party to have the courage to vote in favour of the motion.","Business Secretary suggested he would not back Coalition' economic plan .

You might think that predicting the weather correctly is a fairly basic requirement for a forecaster. But at the Met Office, getting it right is apparently such a shock that its staff have had to be rewarded – with almost £1million in bonuses. Figures released today show forecasters have shared a huge windfall after they met accuracy targets for public forecasts and weather warnings last year. Met Office staff have been handed £1million in bonuses for meeting accuracy targets for public forecasts . The weathermen and women have, however, been accused of a series of high profile blunders in the past, leaving critics to question whether they really deserve a bonus for just doing their job. In total last year the Met Office handed staff £2.7million, with £942,000 of this given for meeting accuracy targets. This is the highest amount paid to staff in bonuses for correctly predicting the weather compared with each of the past five years. Forecasters achieved this with the aid of a new ‘supercomputer’, which costs £8million a year to help with predictions. The Met Office’s chief executive John Hirst was last year paid a total of £185,000, which included a bonus payment of £20,000 – although he took a voluntary pay cut in April last year when his contract was extended. Almost 2,000 staff at the organisation were also given a £346 bonus in their wages as a congratulations for hitting their weather forecast accuracy targets. Critics are unhappy that the Met Office (based in Exeter, above) is rewarding staff despite them not providing the public with long-range forecasts any more . Robert Oxley, campaign director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Given the amount of times that the Met Office has been left with egg on its face it is time it stopped worrying about bonuses and focused on getting its forecasts right.’ Critics are also unhappy that the Met Office is rewarding staff despite them not providing the public with long-range forecasts any more. The 90-day forecasts were shortened to 30 days after the 2009 ‘barbecue summer’ fiasco. Jonathan Powell, of independent forecaster Positive Weather Solutions, said it was ‘totally irresponsible of the Met Office not to offer the public long-range forecasts in order not to be seen as getting it wrong’. The Met Office said it discontinued long range forecasts following research showing the public find shorter forecasts of more use. A Met Office spokesman added: ‘For the last financial year the Met Office met all of its forecast accuracy targets as our public forecasts and weather warnings helped the UK prepare for everything from London 2012, to the wettest year in a century, to widespread snowfall in January. ‘We are consistently ranked in the top two most accurate forecasters in the world by the World Meteorological Organisation and our forecast targets each year help us build on that world leading capability.’","Weathermen and women accused of a series of high profile blunders .

Environmental campaigners have criticised Government moves to delay until 2015 its plan to charge shoppers for plastic bags in supermarkets. The introduction of a 5p charge per bag was announced by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg on Saturday, and was welcomed by green campaigners and shoppers. However, it will not begin in England until 2015, despite already operating in Wales and Northern Ireland, with Scotland following next year. Banished: From 2015, all supermarkets and department stores in England will charge 5p for a plastic carrier bag . Last night, campaigners fighting the blight caused by bag litter called on ministers to bring forward the launch, saying the delay was unnecessary and disappointing. Phil Barton of Keep Britain Tidy said: ‘There is no need for new legislation in England as retailers are already geared up to deal with it. We would like to sit down with the Government and the retail sector to discuss introducing a charge earlier.’ He said adopting the controls in 2014 rather than 2015 could result in 5.25 billion fewer carrier bags being handed out at tills. Ban: The new charge was announced by Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, pictured meeting volunteers from the Scottish Wildlife Trust at Cathkin Marsh nature reserve . The Conservative majority in the . Coalition is understood to have insisted on a delay until after the next . General Election in May 2015, despite the benefits to the environment . and that money raised by the charges will be given to charities that . tackle the impact of plastic bags on wildlife and the environment. The delay is just one of a number of measures that supporters fear will restrict its impact. Significantly, the charge will apply only to stores that employ more than 250 people. This will allow thousands of other retailers to continue giving away millions of single-use bags. As a result, the scheme in England will operate differently to the ones in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, where all bags carry a charge. Separately, retailers may be able to keep some or all of the cash from the charges, rather than being under a legal obligation to give it to good causes. Destructive legacy: Most free plastic carrier bags are not used for more than 20 minute, but can take up to 1,000 years to naturally dissolve . Keep Britain Tidy and the Marine . Conservation Society (MCS) are among the many supporters of the Daily . Mail’s five-year ‘Banish the Bags’ campaign. MCS spokesman Richard Harrington said: ‘England is really lagging behind the rest, and we would like to see the change come in earlier than 2015.’ The British Retail Consortium, which speaks for the big supermarkets, favours a single national scheme. A spokesman said: ‘Any legislation should be, as far as possible, consistent across the UK to avoid confusion for customers and businesses.’ A Lib Dem source dismissed the criticism, saying: ‘We are introducing this measure on a timetable that is realistic.

Julian Assange begged Benedict Cumberbatch not to accept the lead role in the new WikiLeaks film, the actor has revealed. The Australian activist wrote a 10-page email to Cumberbatch the day before the star began filming The Fifth Estate, in which he stars as Assange, in January. 'It was a very considered, thorough, charming and intelligent account of why he thought this was morally wrong for me to be part of something he thought was going to be damaging in real terms – not just to perceptions but to the reality of the outcome for himself, the actor said. Scroll down for video . Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange in the new film about the WikiLeaks founder, The Fifth Estate. The actor says Assange tried to persuade him to reject the role . 'He characterised himself as a political refugee, and with [Chelsea, formerly Bradley] Manning awaiting trial, and other supporters of WikiLeaks who have been detained or might be awaiting detention, and the organisation itself – all of that being under threat if I took part in this film', he told the Guardian. Assange has been outspoken in his opposition to the film, which he has described as a 'massive propaganda attack' on him and his organisation. The movie is based on two books, by the German technology activist Daniel Domscheit-Berg and by Luke Harding and David Leigh of the Guardian, former collaborators with whom the Australian has now fallen out. But Cumberbatch, who said he made repeated unsuccessful requests to meet Assange before beginning filming, has defended the project, saying the film 'shows his ideas and integrity and self-sacrifice'. The actor admitted he thought twice when he received the email because 'I'm a human being'. He wrestled with his reply for four hours before telling Assange the movie would portray his deeds as being nothing but positive and that he would give as 'much complexity and understanding' of Assange in the role as he could. Assange wrote a 10-page email to Cumberbatch, saying the film was not right on moral grounds while soldier Bradley Manning was awaiting trial for releasing restricted documents . He did admit to partly taking on the role because 'I'm a vain actor'  - but insisted he was not 'acting in a moral vacuum'. Asked about Manning – who was sentenced last month to 35 years in prison for leaking documents to WikiLeaks, after which she announced she wished to live as a woman – Cumberbatch said he was not convinced that the army private should be granted the presidential pardon for which she has now appealed, on grounds she took and broke an oath. While alarmed by the revelations of state surveillance disclosed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, the actor admitted he was also ambivalent about disclosing secrets.

Anni Dewani's family have scrutinised the BBC for their creation of a Panorama programme that undermines the claims of her husband, Shrien Dewani . The family of murdered honeymooner Anni Dewani have accused the BBC of playing ‘judge and jury’ in a documentary that casts doubt on the prosecution case against her husband. The 28-year-old was kidnapped and shot dead in the back of a taxi while on honeymoon in South Africa with millionaire Shrien Dewani, in November 2010. Dewani, 33, is accused of paying two local men to kill his wife in a sham car-jacking. But a Panorama programme, The Honeymoon Murder: Who Killed Anni?, claims to expose holes in the evidence of star prosecution witness Zola Tongo. The BBC says it has obtained ‘secret police files’ that will ‘expose fundamental mistakes both in the police investigation and the interpretation of forensic evidence’. Mrs Dewani’s uncle, Ashok Hindocha, said the corporation did not consult the family about the ‘insensitive’ documentary and claims broadcasters had added to their grief. He said producers failed to seek a right to reply from the family and even reused previous interviews with relatives. Mr Hindocha has written to BBC director-general Lord Hall to claim the broadcaster had broken its guidelines to ‘minimise possible distress’ to grieving families. He said: ‘Broadcasters should not be doing a programme before the trial about whether someone is guilty or not guilty. ‘We have a court and a justice system in the world, which should be respected.‘It is not their place to play judge and jury. This battle should be played out in the courts, not in the media.’ Mr Hindocha said the programme was a shameless attempt to ‘play on Anni’s name for publicity and to get viewers’. He asked how the BBC had obtained a confidential South African police file, containing CCTV tapes and mobile phone records, and questioned the motives of whoever leaked the documents. He said: ‘I asked them where they got the information, and they said it wasn’t stolen from the police and they didn’t pay for it. CCTV footage taken from the couple's honeymoon hotel in South Africa shows the final hours of Anni Dewani who was murdered in 2010 . ‘So how did these police files get into their hands and whose interest did it serve? They paid forensic experts to appear on the programme, but they don’t have access to the full case files. And who is going to cross-examine the experts?’ Last night it emerged that the programme had also obtained medical records that apparently suggested the couple were trying for a family. The evidence could contradict police claims that Dewani was secretly gay and ordered his wife’s murder so he could live a homosexual lifestyle. The programme claims: ‘We can reveal medical records – from just days before the honeymoon – show the couple were actively trying for a baby’, but does not elaborate on what the records showed. Mr Hindocha said: ‘I don’t think these claims are correct but it is not for the BBC to broadcast material like police files and medical records. 'It is for the courts to examine.’ Referring to the impending documentary, he said: ‘This has been stressful for all of our family. My brother [Anni’s father] is very sad.’ The Panorama programme also says that Mrs Dewani could have been shot ‘by accident’. Firearms experts say the bullet may have rebounded off her hand and through her chest by accident ‘during a struggle’. The programme also casts doubt on the claims of taxi driver Zola Tongo, 32, who received a reduced sentence of 18 years in return for his testimony. Prosecution witness Tongo claimed that Dewani called him on the morning of the murder, but mobile phone records show that no such call took place. CCTV footage from the same night shows Dewani making what looks like a gunslinger gesture to his wife Anni, hours before she was shot dead . Shrien Dewani is shown on CCTV shortly after being told his wife has been found dead. He is seen again later on the phone and appears to be smiling . A spokesman for Panorama said: ‘We understand that the programme maybe difficult viewing for Anni’s family and have approached it sensitively, including contacting her uncle, as the representative of the family, in advance, to let him know that it would air. ‘We received replies from Mr Hindocha which did not raise these objections. The police evidence we have obtained is neither manufactured nor stolen, nor did we pay for it. Should the Hindocha family wish to issue a statement then we would reflect their position in the programme.’ Dewani is fighting extradition to South Africa to stand trial for the murder of his Swedish-born wife. At a London court hearing in July, magistrates rejected his attempt to stay in the UK for further mental health treatment, but he will challenge the decision in the Supreme Court. The documentary airs on BBC1 on Thursday at 9pm. Anni Dewani sent text messages to her family before her wedding fearing she would never be happy once married to Shrien Dewani . Bride-to-be Anni Dewani sent desperate text messages to her family before her wedding,  saying: ‘I’m going to be unhappy for the rest of my life’. Mrs Dewani sent a series of increasingly distressed messages to her cousin Sneha, expressing deep reservations about her fiancé Shrien. In August 2010, two months after she got engaged, she spoke of her loneliness while visiting his family, writing: ‘Miss you so much. Don’t want to be with these people. I hate them. Want to cry myself to death.’ By September, while she was in India for wedding preparations, she appeared no happier and wrote on September 16: ‘Fighting a lot with Shrien. Told him I’m going home. ‘Wish I never got engaged. Everyone tells me how fortunate I am – even my designer tells me he’s good-looking and that I’m lucky. Absolutely sick.’ On September 21, five weeks before the extravagant Mumbai ceremony, she wrote: ‘I don’t want to marry him . . . we have nothing in common. He’s putting pressure on everything. He’s a perfectionist.’ In another text, she said: ‘Want to cry myself to death’. The Swedish-born bride was concerned that her husband refused to be intimate with her, and texted: ‘One cannot even hug him.’ On September 22, she texted Sneha and said: ‘Told his and my parents I don’t want to get married.’ But her cousin said Mr Dewani persuaded her he would change and the wedding went ahead. A week later, the situation appeared to have deteriorated and she wrote: ‘Hate him. I am not happy.’ Messages sent to her cousin from her honeymoon in South Africa show she was still distressed. On November 10, she said: ‘What shall I do? It’s been one day and I feel exactly the same as I did before.’ But the next day, two days before her death, she seemed to have had a change of heart, texting: ‘Hello! It’s much better now. How are you? Is going better than before. Hard to explain but I’ll call you soon as I return. Hate the word divorce.’ On November 13, she was shot dead in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town.","Family of murdered Anni Dewani have accused BBC of playing 'judge and jury' in documentary .

German police have arrested three Britons competing in a France to Prague rally after they drove through the country in a car disguised as a tank. The trio of friends, who were raising money for Help For Heroes, were put in police cells because of the mock Panzer. The 26-year-olds spent £500 on a R-registered Ford Galaxy, disguised it with camouflage paint, used plywood for the turrett and an old drainpipe for the gun before hitting the road to compete in the 2013 Motoscape Rally from Saint Omer in France to Prague. Having a laugh: The trio of friends, who were raising money for Help For Heroes, were put in police cells for driving the mock Panzer . However, their dreams of winning first prize were dashed when their phoney military motor was stopped by German motorway police who impounded it and locked them up for almost two hours while taking the 'tank' off for a road safety inspection of their own - which it failed. Matthew Antoszkiw, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, who works as a graphic designer, said: 'German MOTs are much stricter than ours. 'They said the brakes were dodgy and it had too much rust but it had got through its MOT in the UK and was properly insured. 'We think they just didn't like a British car driving through their country looking like a tank - they were gunning for us.' Police told them it would cost 4,000 euros to get the car roadworthy. Fundraising: The 26-year-olds spent £500 on the R-registered Ford Galaxy, disguised it with camouflage paint . Mr Antoszkiw said: 'It had been a smooth ride until we got to Germany. We'd had no problems at the ferry port or through passport control in France. 'The tank hadn't offended anyone. We don't think it was insensitive at all - in fact we won a £50 prize for ""best-dressed banger"" which we'll be giving to Help For Heroes.' Mr Antoszkiw, who was with his pals Ryan Gill and Daniel Lenczewski, who are all former pupils of St Bede's School, said: 'We knew as soon as we saw the police car pull out of a sliproad and start following us we were in trouble, it was that inevitable feeling of doom. 'They were very rude, whistling at us to get out the car then said they might crush it. It was pretty clear they didn't like it.' A spokesman for Darmstadt police in Hessen said the vehicle was spotted by officers on the A672 road because it was 'a bizarre conversion'. The fundraisers' dreams of winning first prize were dashed when their phoney military motor was stopped by German motorway police . He said: 'When checking the car, officials found serious flaws in the brake system and rusted wishbone. The rally was therefore terminated prematurely for the young men.' With their hopes of claiming first prize dashed and no chance of forking out enough euros to get the car back on the road, the men were released and walked away from the police station to make their own way home. Mr Antoszkiw said: 'We were just left with no car, no hotel, no taxi number to make our own arrangements. 'Luckily we managed to get flights home the next day but it meant we lost money on the hotel in Prague and flights back from there that we'd already paid for. 'We're about £3,000 out of pocket and feeling pretty bitter about it - although in time we'll probably laugh about it.' As for next year, Mr Antoszkiw said: 'The rally organisers have given us a free pass to enter next year. 'If we do, we won't be going through Germany again - there's nothing much to see anyway.'","Three friends were raising money for Help For Heroes in their mock Panzer .

The parents of an eight-year-old girl who suffered brain damage caused by staff failures during her delivery have won a multimillion pound payout. Ruby Curtis suffers from cerebral palsy after she was starved of oxygen during her birth in 2005 when staff at St James Hospital in Leeds failed to recognise complications. After an eight-year battle, her parents Lisa, 40, and Steve, 41, have been awarded a £2.95million lump sum to help cover the cost of her care. They will also receive annual payments taking the total figure to around £6.6million. A High Court judge approved the sum on Friday which will fund her specialist school and provide care and equipment, case management, therapy and support to help her live an independent life. Payout: Lisa, 40, and Steve Curtis, 41, will receive £6.6m to help pay for their daughter Ruby's care after she was starved of oxygen during her birth at St James Hospital in Leeds . Mrs Curtis was admitted to St James Hospital on 28 August, 2005, when staff gave her a drug to bring on contractions. Staff, who failed to recognise that her uterus had ruptured, were slow to act to deliver Ruby and she was starved of oxygen, causing the irreparable brain damage. Ruby now has athetoid cerebral palsy, affecting all four limbs, head and trunk, with fluctuating muscle tone and some involuntary movements. This affects the execution of her motor skills, therefore she requires help with all aspects of daily living including personal care, feeding, play, and education. Ruby can make vocal sounds but has no clear speech and all of these issues are permanent effects of the birth trauma. Victim: Ruby Curtis suffered irreparable brain damage during her birth and now suffers from athetoid cerebral palsy which affects all her limbs . Mr Curtis, speaking out after winning . the settlement, said: 'She joined the Percy Hedley School, which . specialises in working with children with cerebral palsy, last year and . we are really pleased with the holistic approach they take to therapy . and education. 'It is so much better for Ruby than the mainstream school in Leeds that Ruby previously attended and it is fantastic to see her thrive in her new school. 'Her confidence and self-esteem have improved significantly and working with her specialist one-on-one support is allowing her to flourish in education terms as well. 'The settlement awarded today means Ruby can now continue to attend this fabulous school as it well help fund her fees, accommodation in Newcastle and one-on-one support. 'Ruby's condition affects every aspect of her life and she needs round the clock assistance to meet her needs. 'The settlement approved today gives us peace of mind that she will have the funds to pay for the care, support, therapy and specialist equipment and technology that she needs to maximise her independence and help her reach her full potential for the rest of her life.' Ruby drives an electric-powered wheelchair which has pink bodywork, a personalised number plate and is decorated with pictures of her favourite band, One Direction. Mrs Curtis, who gave up work to care for her daughter, said: 'Ruby is a fantastic little girl and we are so proud of her, she is such an inspiration to us both. I felt angry initially but I don't feel that now, because I love her how she is. 'While it's heart-breaking to see her unable to do so many of the things the majority of other children take for granted, we couldn't have asked for a more perfect daughter. Funds for the future: The Curtis family have been awarded a £2.95million lump sum as well as annual payments which takes the total to £6.6million to help pay for Ruby's future care . 'We want Ruby to experience as much . as she can in life and we help her as best we can. While it is tragic . to think that all of this came as a result of mistakes made in her . delivery that were avoidable, our focus is on making sure Ruby has the . best life possible. 'Ruby . loves the same things as most other eight year old girls such as One . Direction, Disney Princesses and shopping and she likes to get involved . in as many activities as possible. She enjoys playing powerchair . football, going swimming and to the cinema and she has recently joined . Brownies near her school in Newcastle.' The money, which will help give Ruby the best quality of life possible, will be managed by Irwin Mitchell's in-house Court of Protection team. Rachelle Mahapatra, a Partner and medical law expert at Irwin Mitchell's Leeds office representing the family, said: 'The challenge in Ruby's case was ensuring that we are able to provide her with as much independence as possible in her life. Proud parents: Lisa and Steve Curtis said their daughter Ruby is an inspiration to them both and they couldn't have asked for a more perfect little girl . 'This includes having full-time professional carers so that Mum and Dad can be just that, and so that one day she can go to university and live as full a life as possible. The Hospital admitted majority responsibility which paved the way for the settlement approved today. 'Ruby's family have shown tremendous devotion and support to help her achieve the best quality of life possible over the last eight years, but the fact remains that her brain injury is so severe she needs specialist help from professionals and the settlement will now provide exactly that.' At the High Court in Leeds, where the legal settlement was agreed, Judge Mark Gosnell told her parents they had faced a struggle for many years to care for their daughter and deal with the ongoing legal claim. He said the settlement would enable them to secure in future a 'better family life for both you and Ruby' and he hoped the formal apology made by hospital chiefs would give them 'some feeling of closure'.

It has been billed as Britain’s creepiest and most claustrophobic ‘whodunit’ to date. And tonight fans of the hit BBC One crime drama What Remains will finally find out who murdered Melissa Young and left her body to rot in a loft for almost two years. The show, which has a six million audience, has been dubbed a cross between ITV’s Broadchurch and the Danish crime drama The Killing. The action takes place in an old house divided into flats. Over the past three weeks cameras have explored every nook and cranny of the building to make viewers feel they are trapped there with the killer. Tony Basgallop, who wrote the show, said: ‘It’s Cluedo, isn’t it? An old-school whodunit.’ Here’s our guide to those in the frame, but don’t make up your minds yet – as the twists and turns keep coming even after the crime is solved..... Kieron Moss: Killer odds 2-1 . Newspaper reporter, divorcé, recovering alcoholic. Lives in  Flat 2 with girlfriend, fellow journalist Patricia Keenan. Seems uninterested in a potential scoop on his doorstep, insisting there is nothing suspicious about the death. Tells police he had little contact with the victim – but is later unmasked as a former lover. Has a history of sexual violence when he falls off the wagon and treated Melissa with contempt while they were seeing each other. Basgallop says: ‘Kieron has  these demons – this monster that’s his alcoholism.’ Suspects: Alcoholic Kieron Moss (left) is the bookies favourite. But Elaine Markham (right) bullied Melissa . Elaine Markham: Killer odds 3-1 . Short-tempered and controlling graphic designer. Shares Flat 3 with lover and business partner Peggy Scott. Bullied Melissa into taking part in an underwear shoot for a prospective client and became aggressive when Melissa said she didn’t want the photographs to appear in print. Elaine is equally intimidating towards timid Peggy. Basgallop says: ‘Both Elaine and Peggy used Melissa and she let them down. Melissa was in the middle of these two which was not a very nice place to be.’ Joe Sellers: Killer odds 3-1 . Busybody bachelor who lives in basement flat. Doesn’t get on with neighbours. A teacher, he told police he lived alone but, in fact, has been living with a former pupil, Liz Fletcher, for five years. Makes no secret of his dislike for Melissa, saying: ‘I didn’t like the girl and don’t see why I should pretend I did just because she has gone.’ However, he knew Melissa’s  mother and cared for her in the weeks leading up to her own death. Basgallop says: ‘Joe is the guy everyone is slightly scared of. There is a feeling that he is a monster because he lives alone.’ Creepy: Teacher Joe Moss (left) makes no secret of his dislike of Melissa.  Little is known about Richard Webb (right), who may appear friendly, but could have plenty of skeletons in his closet . Richard Webb: Killer odds 4-1 . Seemingly affable former resident of  Flat 4 who warns Detective Harper the residents are ‘not a friendly bunch’. Could have skeletons in the cupboard as he is the character  we know least about. We do know that Melissa once rejected his advances, so was he out for revenge? No longer lives in the UK, leading to speculation that he may have fled the scene of the crime. However, seems genuinely shocked when Harper contacts him about the death. In stark contrast to  some of the other residents, he is  only too keen to speak about  some of Melissa’s good qualities. Revenge: Michael Jenson (left) has a vendetta against his former teacher, Joe Sellers. But Adam Moss (right) constantly bullied Melissa . Michael Jenson: Killer odds 5-1 . Shoe salesman and father-to-be. Has just moved into the block with girlfriend Vidya Khan. Would appear to be in the clear because he never lived at the flats when Melissa lived there, but is known to Joe Sellers, who taught him at school, and Liz Fletcher. Claims Sellers victimised him at school and makes it clear he is out for revenge. Breaks into Sellers’s school locker and strikes up a relationship with Liz. Jenson tells his girlfriend: ‘The old b*****d had it in for me and still does. He was horrible to me. I hated him back then and still hate him. 'He’ll find out soon enough that he’s not dealing with a kid any longer.’ Adam Moss: Killer odds 6-1 . Kieron Moss’s highly sexed and deeply troubled teenage son, who treats his father’s flat as a hotel. He is a bully who never missed a chance to humiliate Melissa when she was alive. Taunted her about her weight and has described her as ‘a skank’, ‘heifer’ and ‘wildebeest’. After Melissa’s death, the word ‘skank’ later appears daubed on a wall in her flat. Adam has made a series of passes at his father’s girlfriend. She is scared of being left alone with him but even Kieron, who has very little time for him, doesn’t think he would hurt a fly. Violent streak: Recluse Liz Fletcher (left) knocked out retired detective Len Harper during one of her midnight walks. But does Peggy Scott's (right) reluctance to return to the house implicate her? Liz Fletcher: Killer odds 10-1 . Woman with a troubled past who is on the run from someone or something. Former pupil of Joe Sellers who turned to him for help and moved into his flat five years ago. Living there secretly, she rarely leaves. As a result, none of the neighbours knows of her existence. Has a habit of wandering round the building at night and makes several visits to Melissa’s flat. Has a violent streak and knocks an unsuspecting Detective Len Harper unconscious when he interrupts one of her night-time prowls. Fascinated by some of Melissa’s most private possessions.

Vice President Joe Biden has sparked rumors of presidential aspirations by delivering a campaign-style speech in Iowa, the first voting state in the presidential primary process. Most Democrats are watching former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for hints about her 2016 plans, but Biden has neither confirmed nor denied his intentions to run. The vice president's appearance at Iowa's 36th annual 'Tom Harkin Steak Fry' fundraiser may one day be viewed as a telling sign of his presidential intentions. Left holding the baby: Vice President Joe Biden holds five-month-old Joey Harman, of Ankeny, Iowa, after speaking at Iowa Senator Tom Harkin's annual fundraising steak fry dinner . Democratic fundraiser: Vice President Joe Biden speaks during Iowa Senator Tom Harkin's annual fundraising steak fry dinner on Sunday . The Democratic fundraiser, named for the veteran senator from Iowa, is . closely watched in this Midwestern state, which helps winnow out the . crop of presidential contenders every four years leading up to the Iowa . caucuses, the first voting event of each presidential cycle. Addressing the crowd at the Warren County Fairgrounds, Biden mentioned . 2016 in a sideways fashion, making light of the national media presence . that showed up for the event. 'It's amazing when you come to speak at the steak fry, a whole lot of people seem to take notice. I don't know why the hell that is,' Biden joked, acknowledging the event's importance. 'You've attracted the entire national press corps here.' The 70-year-old Biden has left open the possibility of a run for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination in order to get a chance to succeed President Barack Obama. Many in Washington believe Biden won't run if Clinton does, and she is making a regular series of public appearances that could easily be interpreted as setting the stage for a campaign. Clinton is considered the frontrunner for the Democrats, with Biden a distant second. In his speech, Biden extolled Obama's leadership, defending his handling of the economy and the crisis over Syria's chemical weapons. He also gave himself a bit of credit for being part of the team. Meeting of minds: Vice President Joe Biden connects with a supporter after the annual fundraiser . Second-in-command: In his speech, Biden praised President Obama and the American people . Obama, said Biden, reduced the national debt by $2.5 trillion 'and in the process we've created 2.5 million new jobs. But folks, there's a lot more we have to do.' Biden also tweaked Russian President Vladimir Putin for a New York Times opinion article last week in which he criticized Obama for praising 'American exceptionalism.' 'It's always been the story... of the journey of this country that the American people have been ahead, and I know I've been criticized for saying this, but I'll say it again: That's what makes America exceptional,' said Biden. Putin helped reach a deal to gain control of Syria's chemical weapons, Biden said, 'not because he's a good guy, [but] because of naked self-interest.' Harkin told reporters last Thursday that Biden could find 'fertile ground' in Iowa should he choose to run in 2016, but did not predict whether Clinton or Biden would prevail. 'They're both well liked in Iowa. There's no doubt about that. But you know there's a lot of time between now and 2015 when things really start to move,' the senator said. Babe in arms: Five-month-old Joey Harman will likely never remember the day he was held by Joe Biden, who may run for president in 2016 . Obama himself refused to be drawn into discussion of his successor in an interview broadcast on Sunday on ABC's This Week. 'What I would say to folks out there is we are tremendously lucky to have an incredible former secretary of state who couldn't have served me better, and an incredible vice president who couldn't be serving me better,' he said. Betty Byrd, 87, of Boone, Iowa, has supported Biden 'from way back' in 1987. She supported Biden in the 2008 Iowa caucuses and would support him again if Biden runs in 2016. 'He says all the right things,' Byrd said of Biden. 'Even though he's getting older, that's not going to slow him down... He can handle everything.'","Joe Biden was at Senator Tom Harkin's annual fundraiser .

A champion swimmer spied on a woman using a pair of mirrored goggles to peek under a changing room cubicle, a court heard. Freestyle record-breaker James Mackay, 28, who has competed for Great Britain, angled the swimming goggles against a shampoo bottle so he could see into the neighbouring changing room. Magistrates were told the married swimmer, who set the British 800m freestyle record in 2004, targeted the same woman on three separate occasions at the Abbey Stadium, Redditch, Worcestershire. Champion swimmer: James Mackay, 28, pictured in 2004 after setting an 800m British freestyle record, used goggles to peer under a pool cubicle in Redditch, a court heard . His victim became 'uneasy' when Mackay, from Redditch, spent a suspicious amount of time in the showers as if waiting for her to return from the pool. The woman, who cannot be named, told Redditch Magistrates' Court that on the first occasion she noticed Mackay's blue flippers and sports bottle inside a cubicle. She chose one further away but he moved in to the dressing room next to her, when she noticed his distinctive orange and black goggles on the floor. She said: 'I was taking my swimming costume off and put my towel round me and then I heard the door next door. 'I saw this flash of blue flippers, he had moved next to me. 'I then noticed the goggles. They were at an angle and looking into the cubicle. I felt uncomfortable but I thought I was being paranoid.' Guilty: Swimmer moved cubicles to observe woman in changing rooms . On two further occasions the woman purposely chose an cubicle against a wall and blocked the middle gap with her bag, but Mackay chose the cubicle behind her. She said: 'I started to shake and I felt no one had taken me seriously. 'I videoed the goggles so I could show the Abbey Stadium.' Police later seized Mackay's goggles and used them to reconstruct the incidents which confirmed that they could see a reflection between cubicles. He claimed he had spent a long time in the shower due to performing stretching exercises and said he didn't recognise his victim. But magistrates rejected his defence and on Tuesday  found Mackay guilty of three counts of observing a person doing a private act for sexual gratification. Chairman of the bench Peter Sheppard said: 'We are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the equipment belonged to you and was being used to observe the occupant in the next cubicle.' Sentencing was adjourned until May 8 for probation reports to be prepared. Mackay was bailed and banned from entering the Abbey Stadium until further notice. A spokeswoman from Redditch Borough Council, which runs the stadium, said the victim had discussed her concerns with staff and had wanted to report the incident to police herself. She added all possible measures were taken to ensure people's privacy.

Seventeen soldiers, including two sergeant majors, face being discharged from the Army after being caught using performance-enhancing drugs in the Forces’ biggest reported case of doping. The soldiers, from the 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery (7 Para RHA), failed a compulsory drugs test after they used a sports supplement containing the restricted substance ephedrine, a stimulant which has similar effects to the Class B drug amphetamine, such as an increased heart rate and dizziness. The soldiers, who follow an arduous physical training regime, are understood to have claimed they took the ephedrine – an ingredient in a type of  bodybuilding product called ‘fat stripper’ – unwittingly. Trouble: The soldiers, who follow an arduous physical training regime, are understood to have claimed they took the ephedrine - an ingredient in a type of bodybuilding product called 'fat stripper' - unwittingly . The drug is available legally as a prescription medicine but is also contained in unlicensed sports supplements sold online. According to defence sources, the regiment’s commanding officer is now weighing up the cost of losing 17 soldiers against his obligation to the Army’s ‘zero-tolerance’ drugs policy. The shamed soldiers were among 400 members of 7 Para RHA tested at Merville Barracks, Colchester, at the end of August. The test was apparently timed to identify those who had consumed illegal substances during the regiment’s summer holidays. Urine samples for all personnel were examined for recreational substances such as heroin, cocaine and cannabis. The 17 soldiers facing expulsion fell foul of additional tests for controlled substances such as ephedrine. Urine samples for all personnel were examined for recreational substances such as heroin, cocaine and cannabis as well as other drugs like ephedrine . According to Ministry of Defence guidelines, any serviceman or woman found to have taken banned drugs can expect to be discharged. However, in exceptional circumstances, a commanding officer may choose a more lenient punishment and remedial training. Last night a regimental source said the drugs test results had shocked all the members of 7 Para RHA. He said: ‘We expected maybe five or six fails. That’s pretty standard, especially when they test us straight after Christmas or summer leave. But 17 is off the charts, and for a pair of sergeant majors to get done too is unheard of. ‘These guys are gym rats rather than recreational drug users, and they’re guilty of being stupid for not checking what was in the fat-stripper product, but that’s all. 'A warning needs to be sent across the Army about the dangers of these products. A lot of guys are pumping iron and overdoing it. They could pay a high price.’ An MoD spokesman said last night: ‘The Armed Forces have a zero-tolerance approach to inappropriate behaviour, including substance misuse. 'Where an individual is found, through compulsory drug testing or other investigation, to have fallen short of the Services’ high standards, they will be dealt with through the military discipline process.’","Soldiers claim they unwittingly took ephedrine contained in supplements .

Policing Britain's streets can be a hazardous occupation - but it seems officers can't even drop their guard when they get back to the office. A series of bizarre office-based injury claims submitted by officers has shone a light on the extraordinary 'compensation culture' a the heart of many police forces across the UK. In one staggering claim, a constable insisted he injured his back reaching to switch on a computer while another said he had hurt himself 'doing the washing'. Hazardous: Officers face a host of dangers - not only on the streets but also while performing mundane office tasks. (Stock picture) Among the hundreds of claims, . revealed in a Freedom of Information request, was a Kent Police officer . who injured his foot after being 'run over by an office chair'. Another police woman broke her toe after . knocking over a table during a tactical training exercise and another . suffered ‘stinging eyes’ after accidentally squirting hand gel into . their face. The details emerged just a few days after it was revealed PC Kelly Jones, who . planned to sue the owner of a petrol station after tripping on a kerb . while investigating a break-in, has dropped her claim for damages. Danger money: Hundreds of police officers and staff have submitted injury claims against their force, according to information obtained under a Freedom of Information request . She . dropped her pursuit of damages in the hope that 'wider concerns the . public may have' can be resolved, according to the Police Federation. Ms Jones faced controversy last year after she filed a civil claim against Steve Jones, the owner of the Nun's . Bridges Filling Station, in Thetford, Norfolk, demanding he reimburse the income she lost as a result of injuries sustained at the scene. Claim: WPC Kelly Jones who tripped on a kerb in the car wash area of a filling station owned in Thetford, Norfolk . A recent report revealed that police . forces have paid out and estimated £9m in compensation to their own . officers for injuries at work over the past three years. Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: 'This is yet further evidence that the compensation culture has got completely out of hand in this country. 'Policing . is a difficult job that involves officers putting themselves at risk . and some claims will have been perfectly legitimate and reasonable. 'However, a number of these claims will either have been nobody’s fault . or could have been avoided with a bit of common sense: at the end of the . day, accidents do happen. 'Taxpayers . want to know that police forces are spending their money on frontline . policing and keeping us safe, not settling spurious claims. 'When . police budgets are so tight and savings have to be found, people will . be angry that so much of their cash is being spent on compensation and . associated legal bills.' Freedom of Information requests . asking about injuries to officers and staff in police stations were . answered by 22 forces around the UK. In . some case, forces refused to specify which injury resulted in a . compensation payout for fear of identifying an officer. It is also not . clear which claims were dismissed during the adjudication process. But . a Police Federation spokesman said: 'It is only right that officers . should be offered the same protection as anyone else who might be . injured while at work, often through no fault of their own, and forces . will only pay compensation if a claim is valid.' Despite . some forces omitting to state how the injuries were caused, bosses at . Cambridgeshire, Kent, Cheshire, Cleveland and Norfolk Police revealed . the full extent of injuries over the past 18 months. Steve Jones, pictured, said he was eager to move on from the ordeal which started when Ms Jones tripped on this 6in kerb at the garage in Thetford, Norfolk . A retired police officer, who asked . not to be named, said: 'It’s not really the number of injuries that is . the worry, it’s more than trivial nature of most of them. 'Some officers can’t seem to make a cup of coffee or navigate their way past a desk without hurting themselves.' Another . officer, who has been in the job 10 years, laughed off the injuries, . saying: 'You’ve got to laugh really - it’s like reading the script to a . new Three Stooges film. 'How . can an officer break their toe knocking over a desk during tactical . awareness training? It’s not exactly a ringing endorsement you can do . your job is it?' Most of the . police forces said that compensation claims were still on-going for a . number of the incidents and that they would not reveal details of the . exact claims as it could identify the officer or police staff member . involved.

Dish of the day at Waitrose yesterday was humble pie – and first in the queue to see it served up must surely have been Delia Smith. Months after the Queen of TV cookery stopped appearing in TV advertisements and Pippa Middleton was hired as its magazine columnist, the supermarket has decided to reinstate her. In a U-turn, the grocery giant has asked the much-loved cook to bring her successful online culinary school to its website. Triumphant return: Delia Smith has been signed up again by Waitrose. The supermarket's customers were annoyed when Pippa Middleton was given a column in the store magazine soon after Delia departed . The move follows anger in the kitchens . of Middle Britain over Waitrose’s decision to drop her from its . television ad campaign last year, while promoting Miss Middleton. Customers . saw the decision as a betrayal of a woman who had taught two . generations to cook and the resulting Twitter storm suggested it was a . ‘gratuitous insult’ to customers, with some threatening a supermarket . boycott. Her departure was . followed by the news that Waitrose had hired the Duchess of Cambridge’s . sister as the new star columnist for its magazine. The . news irked many Delia lovers, not least because the 29-year-old’s . culinary experience seemed limited to enjoying the hospitality at . celebrity parties and making sushi rolls for her university chums. Added . to that was the widespread mocking of her Celebrate party planning . book, which had disastrous sales. Pippa was signed as a columnist for Waitrose's monthly magazine Waitrose Kitchen . Yesterday, breathless bosses at . Waitrose announced their ‘exciting new move’ to work with Delia again. Her . online cookery school, launched earlier this year, will appear on the . Waitrose TV section of the supermarket’s website, offering a free video . library of lessons and techniques from beginner to advanced level. Waitrose chiefs were positively effervescent yesterday, calling Delia’s . tutorials the ‘hero of the channel’ and praising her ‘inspiration and . expertise’. Waitrose . marketing director Rupert Thomas said: ‘We have a long and successful . history of working with Delia and we’re thrilled to be joining forces . again on the Delia Online Cookery School with Waitrose, which we believe . will be the definitive online tool for cookery tuition.’ Delia, who has sold 21million cookery books, maintained her dignity throughout the controversy. When it was suggested she might want to prepare one of Pippa’s recipes at home, she simply laughed. Yesterday, the 72-year-old spoke of her ‘ambition’ to teach anyone who wants to learn to cook. ‘If . you are from nine to 109 you will be able to learn anything from . boiling an egg to baking a cake – I don’t think you can learn in a . better way,’ she said.

A criminal convicted of harassment and theft was allowed to freely roam a court building for more than an hour after being jailed - because there were no prison cells in which to hold him. Ryan Goss, 19, boasted that he could have easily ‘done a runner’ when magistrates politely asked him to wait at the back of Worcester Magistrates’ Court after they handed him a 16-week jail term. Goss was locked up last Thursday for breaching the community order part of his suspended prison sentence - but was told could not be taken to jail straight away because the cells were shut that day. Convicted criminal: Ryan Goss, 19, boasted that he could have easily 'done a runner' when magistrates politely asked him to wait at the back of a court after they handed him a 16-week jail term . The building was short of security staff, so Goss - who had previously skipped bail - was instead told to wait at the back of the courtroom. But he loitered outside with other members of the public. He also ate chocolate from a vending machine, smoked in the toilets, phoned his work to say he was going to be ‘off for a while’, chatted to friends and arranged for clothes to be brought to him in jail. Eventually a security van arrived from 36 miles away in Wolverhampton - one hour and five minutes later - to drive Goss a further 70 miles to HMP Glen Parva in Wigston, Leicestershire. Speaking after his sentencing, Goss laughed how he could have walked free from court and would have done if he had been given a longer sentence. He even joked about being a ‘free man’. Goss said: ‘Last year, when I did a runner they couldn’t catch me for four months - and now they’re putting all this trust in me. I was really surprised. I have been able to call five or six people. Cells closed: The Worcester Magistrates' Court building was short of security staff, so Goss - who had previously skipped bail - was instead told to wait at the back of the courtroom . ‘I have just sorted out someone to bring me my clothes. I haven’t got any cuffs on me. I’m still a free man. Normally, I would be in a cell now, waiting, but I have time to sort things out. Delay: Goss ate chocolate from a vending machine, smoked in the toilets, and phoned his work to say he was going to be 'off for a while' ‘I even rang up work and said I wouldn’t be in. It’s inhumane treatment - tempting me to do a runner and with all the things I have got going for me in my life at the moment. ‘If I had been given a longer sentence I’d be gone by now. At the moment, I will be out before Christmas, and if I ran away I would just be sent down for longer - but it’s only two months. ‘I might as well just do it. If it was a longer stretch there would be no chance I’d be waiting here.’ The court heard Goss had breached an original order, which was put in place for harassment, theft and failing to surrender to bail, which included completing 100 hours of unpaid work. He had only completed 25 hours. But he was told by magistrates that because the cells were closed on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the court were short-staffed, he would have to wait to be taken away. Chairman of the magistrates Ray Needham said: ‘You have a persistent disregard for court orders and we feel it would not be unjust to activate the custodial sentence. Wait at the back of court until the security staff arrive. 'You are in lawful custody and must remain in the court. We are short of security staff. That is why you have not been taken down immediately.’ After the hearing even Goss’s solicitor, Mark Turnbull, admitted the decision did ‘not make any sense’, saying: ‘There is a risk of people walking out the door. ‘It is a hell of a temptation when you’ve just been given a prison sentence. I can’t see the sense of it. 'There is a concern that some people will do a runner. It seems this has just been imposed on the court without anyone thinking it through.’ 'It is just a matter of time before someone does a runner. It is an absolute joke' Rob Macrory, local solicitor . Local solicitor Rob Macrory also branded the ruling ‘a farce’ and said new regulations mean Worcester criminals are now held in custody at neighbouring courts in Redditch and Kidderminster. However, Goss was not transferred to these courts or Worcester Crown Court over the road, where the majority of security staff were based that day. Mr Macrory said: ‘It’s a farce. This has only just come into play around two weeks ago. ‘What has happened is the cells are closed at Worcester Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday and Thursday, the dock officers are moved to the crown court across the road. Surprise: Speaking after his sentencing, Goss laughed how he could have walked free from court . ‘All prisoners at Worcester go to Redditch Magistrates on Tuesday and Kidderminster on Thursday. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, Kidderminster and Redditch prisoners then move to Worcester. ‘This has caused massive delays in the courts and no one has thought to plan this through at all - it was an accident waiting to happen. ‘The court has probation breach cases and trials on Tuesday and Thursday, but if someone is convicted, they can’t go to prison straight away. ‘This applies to everyone, even someone who has committed a serious assault - it is just a matter of time before someone does a runner. It is an absolute joke. ‘With the case of Ryan Goss, although they had officers and vans across the road at the crown court, they didn’t think to call them to walk across the road and deal with the problem, . ‘It is lucky he didn’t escape. Mr Goss is the only incident so far, but I believe this closing of the cells will be happening on a national scale soon.’ A spokesman from Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service insisted Goss was not considered a risk to the public. He said: ‘Worcester Magistrates Court does not list custody cases on Thursdays. ‘This was an unexpected custody case and the defendant was required to wait on court premises for an hour to be collected by the prisoner escort service. ‘The defendant was not considered a risk to the public by the court and remained inside the building during this time.’","Ryan Goss, 19, was asked to wait at back of Worcester Magistrates' Court .

With divorce fast becoming the norm it seems true love is harder and harder to find these days. But as these letters reveal, one smitten couple found a love so strong it was able to endure even while they were separated during World War II. Not only that, it lasted for a total of 70 years of marriage until they both died in 2011, he aged 96 and she aged 92, within just three days of one another. How time passes: Frederick and Elizabeth Noble wed on New Year's Day 1941 while Frederick . was on 48-hour leave from the Royal Tank Corps and stayed married for . the next 70 years . But, as remarkable as their relationship had seemed in life, in death it was about to give up its biggest and most heartwarming surprise. After Frederick and Elizabeth Noble had passed relatives discovered they had kept 250 love letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine's cards from each other. Their grandson, Dr Andrew Rowland, has taken them along to the Antique Roadshow TV program. In one extract read on tonight's show, Frederick writes: 'You are the most wonderful, marvellous, precious, beloved, lovable, . adoring, adorable, charming, divine and loving sweetheart wife that has . ever lived. 'Darling, come a little closer and let me whisper in . your darling ears, all these loving words, because they are meant for . you, my sweetheart.' The pair wrote a series of remarkable and passionate love letters to one another throughout World War II . The amazing collection of 250 letters, telegrams, notes and Valentine's cards was stored in a tea chest . The couple, who shared the same birthday, kept the memories stashed away inside a tea chest in their home in Wingate, County Durham. Speaking about the letters, Fiona Bruce, the show's host, said: 'Theirs was a real love story. What struck me about the . letters was the sheer outpouring of emotion across their pages. 'They . reveal two people who had fallen headlong in love - and that love burned . even more brightly while they were forced apart by war.' Frederick and Elizabeth Noble wed on New Year's Day in 1941 while he was on 48-hour leave from the Royal Tank Corps. He had volunteered for the Army in 1936 despite having been selected . as a professional footballer by Aston Villa and served in Afghanistan, . India, Burma, Ceylon and France. From these war-torn . countries he wrote the tear-jerking telegrams to his wife who was . nursing injured servicemen back home. After the war, . Elizabeth carried on her work as a nurse while Frederick became a miner . in the East Durham coalfield, before rising to the position of colliery overseer. During their long lives the besotted pair built up a large family of two daughters, four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren and it was grandson who discovered the letters . Perhaps the most heart-wrenching messages were written when Frederick's leave was cancelled. He says: 'I'm very sorry my beloved, I can't get home. That's all I live for, . home and you. In another passage he adds: 'We both feel the same when I have to return from leave. I have to take a . firm hold of myself or I would never come back. 'I hate to see the back . of you as my bus or train pulls out because I know it will be weeks . before I set eyes on you again. It's terrible when we have to part - too . awful for words.' Showing a touch of humour, Frederick writes again to compliment his wife's skill in the kitchen: 'Darling, no matter what you think, I still say that you are a good cook . - so let's not have a small row. You know I wish that today I could . have sat down to one of your dinners.' Elizabeth's communication is more limited, as she was kept in the dark about where her husband was to keep military operations a secret. In the letters she did write she talks about the home front, rationing, and hiding under the kitchen table while bombs fell on the main road near their house. Only a small selection of letter were taken to Antiques Roadshow for filming and the family are keeping the rest secret while they decide what to do with them . While the letters reveal a lot about the couple's marriage, the war and their incredible devotion to one another, only a small selection were taken along to the show's filming in North Yorkshire. The rest are being kept a secret while the family, made up of the couple's two daughters, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, decide what to do with them. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Dr Rowland revealed that towards the end of their lives the pair talked about not wanting to go on without each other. He said that the family were comforted in their sadness by the thought that, in the end, Elizabeth had only had to endure three days without her beloved other half. Frederick died peacefully on December 4th, 2011, and Elizabeth on December 7th.","Frederick and Elizabeth Noble married in 1941 while he was on leave .

Sir George Castledine, 66, embarked upon a relationship with a vulnerable female patient who he was meant to be giving bereavement counselling but today he denied that his motives were either sexual or financial . A professor knighted for his role in nursing has admitted telling an 83-year-old patient that he needed to go to the gym and get fit so he could ‘make love’ to her. Sir George Castledine, 66, made regular visits to the woman’s home . late at night and declared his love for her in a series of phone calls . following the death of her husband of 59 years it is claimed. In an admission today, the married father-of-three confessed to calling the ‘vulnerable’ woman ‘darling’, ‘my little Tinkerbell’ and telling her ‘I love you’ during telephone conversations and taking her on holiday to Wales. During one call, Sir George, one of the country’s most respected nursing experts told her that he needed to go to the gym to get fit or he ‘wouldn’t be able to make love’ to her. Sir George also admitted lavishing the widow with gifts at Christmas and accepting presents of aftershave and flowers from her, the Nursing and Midwifery heard. He had previously denied the allegation which relates to failing to maintain appropriate professional boundaries with the woman, known only as Patient A. But today, Terry Munyard, representing Sir George, asked that the charge be put to him again telling the hearing: 'That claim is accepted by the registrant' Panel chair Susan Hurds said: 'I can formally announce that this charge, in its entirety, is admitted and found proved by way of that admission.' The allegation further states that the nurse, who was knighted for services to the healthcare profession in 2007, accompanied Patient A on a trip to Wales and continued to contact her despite knowing that she was emotionally dependent on him. Dr Elizabeth Offen, an expert witness in clinical psychology, told a conduct and competence committee: 'The very nature of counselling is that the patient reveals very intimate details about themselves, raw primitive emotions, and that leads to increased power.

'Tough new stance': Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, is set to announce new rules for dealing with benefit cheats . Benefit cheats face up to ten years in prison under new rules that  mean the offence will be treated as seriously as bank fraud. Britain’s top prosecutor will today announce that middle-class and ‘professional’ cheats who get ‘one over on the system’ will be sent straight to Crown Court where they will face similar sentences as money launderers. Keir Starmer, head of the Crown Prosecution Service, said society was hurting as a result of people taking advantage of the benefit system, and he would crack down on perpetrators. He will announce a ‘tough stance’ for ‘those who flout the system’ and will ensure that for the first time, the overall cost of benefit fraud to the country will be considered when charges are pursued.Mr Starmer said: ‘It’s not only taxpayers that suffer. ‘Benefits exist to protect and support the most vulnerable people in our society and, whenever the system is defrauded, it’s also taking money away from those with a genuine need. ‘The cost to the nation incurred by benefit fraud should be at the forefront of lawyers’ minds when considering whether a prosecution is in the public interest. ‘The loss of money has a significant impact on communities up and down the country.’ Benefit and tax credit fraud costs Britain more than £2billion a year. Offences of less than £20,000 were previously dealt with in magistrates’ courts, where sentences are restricted to 12 months. The new guidelines have discarded the financial limit so that small cases will be sent to Crown court, where perpetrators can receive longer sentences. They will result in more suspects being charged under the Fraud Act, and could be sentenced to ten years in prison. Under current guidelines, benefit cheats are often charged under social security legislation and face a maximum sentence of seven years. Mr Starmer said: ‘The guidance for prosecutors is clear that if the evidence demonstrates an element of dishonesty, rather than just knowledge of a fraud, the appropriate charges should be used. ‘This will ensure that following conviction, all options are on the table for magistrates and judges, including custodial sentences. ‘Indeed, prosecutors are also instructed not to shy away from using a range of legislation that carries higher sentences where it is merited.’ Longer sentences: The new rules could see more benefit cheats face longer custodial sentences .","Benefit fraud offences of less than £20k are currently handled by magistrates .

Women have deserted David Cameron’s Tories in three years because they think he is out of touch and too posh, a demining survey has found. After securing a five-point Conservative lead among female voters at the last general election, the party has now slumped to 13 points behind Labour. Almost half of women think Mr Cameron is the most out of touch of the main party leaders, with just a third satisfied with his leadership. Woman trouble: David Cameron has seen his popularity with female voters evaporate, handing Labour a large lead in the polls . Switch: Labour's lead over the Tories among women now stands at 13 points, according to the Mumsnet/ Ipsos Mori poll . The Conservatives have repeatedly launched attempts to woo the female vote, hiring advisers dedicated to developing policies which appeal to women. But the increase in Labour’s popularity since 2010 has been fuelled by women abandoning Mr Cameron in favour of Ed Miliband. Three years ago 36 per cent of women backed the Tories, compared to 31 per cent for Labour. But a new Ipsos Mori survey for Mumsnet shows only 29 per cent now support the Conservatives, with Labour up to 42 per cent. The gap is three times large than among male voters. Labour has a 25 point lead among women aged 18-34 and 21 points among 35-54 year olds. Adding to the Tory woes, Labour is even ahead among the most affluent women who might be expected to back the Tories. Justine Roberts, chief executive of Mumsnet, said: ‘On the key issues of the economy and employment and particularly where the cuts have fallen, women feel like there is a lack of someone looking out for their interests. ‘One bit of the narrative [about Cameron] that stands up is this elitist Oxbridge-Eton man who doesn't quite get women.’ More than half of women (58 per cent) say they are satisfied with Mr Cameron’s leadership, with only 33 per cent satisfied. And asked which leader is the most out of touch – Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband or Nick Clegg – the Tory leader came out on top at 46 per cent. During a series of focus groups, female voters were asked what they thought about the party leaders. Mr Cameron was described as ‘out of touch’, with mothers angry at cuts to child benefit and a lack of help for families. ‘He does bugger all for women like me,’ said Tanya, a stay-at-home mother who voted Conservative in 2010. Thumbs down: Labour leader Ed Miliband was branded 'creepy' while Lib Dem Leader Nick Clegg was described in a focus group as 'damaged goods' Carla, who backed the Lib Dems in 2010, said of the PM: ‘Rich, privileged, public-school-educated, what has he got in common with 99% of voters?’ But there was little good news for the Labour and Lib Dem leaders. Mr Clegg was branded a ‘snake in the grass [who] sacrificed his integrity to get a place in the leadership’. The Sunday Times reported. Another branded him ‘damaged goods in terms of integrity’. Mr Miliband was described as ‘creepy’ and ‘faceless’, with many struggling to distinguish between him from his brother David. Miss Roberts, the chief executive of Mumsnet, added: ‘There is no real positive feeling. If anything the messaging is that there is a real job for Miliband to do to convince women in particular that he is actually capable.""","Tories had 5-point lead among in 2010 but now 13 points behind Labour .

French police have found traces of blood belonging to a missing French beauty queen in a freezer that belonged to her father. Allison Benitez's blood was found in a freezer at her father's French foreign legion barracks . The DNA was discovered at the French Foreign Legion barracks where Francisco Benitez worked before his suicide on August 5. Investigators concluded the freezer had been scoured and washed along with a carpet, a few days after Allison Benitez vanished with her mother, Maria-Josee Benitez., from their home in Perpignan on July 14. Mr Benitez took his own life after falling under the suspicion of police investigating the two women's disappearence. He left a letter and video behind professing his innocence, before hanging himself in the barracks where he worked. The Spanish national had sent emails to his parents, bosses and friends telling them he could no longer stand the suspicion he was under. Sources close to the case said the chief warrant officer said he was innocent and declared his love for his daughter. 'We are a family, like every other family, with highs and lows. People . who really know me, know that Allison is my life. Today, I have a lot of . uncertainty…A lot of different things are going through my head. I’m . hanging on, and hanging on, but I’m at the point of exploding' he said in a tearful video published by Paris match after he was found hanged in the barracks where the blood was found. The two women's disappearance was . initially treated as a simple missing persons case - one of the tens of . thousands such incidents that take place every year in France - . especially as husband and wife were separating. Missing: Benitez's daughter Allison (right), 19, and his wife . Marie-Josee Benitez (left), 53, disappeared on July 14 and have not been . seen since . Since the mother and daughter disappeared however their Facebook and Twitter pages have gone quiet and neither has used their bank account or answered their phone. The pair also left behind their car and pet dog, a sign, say the family’s neighbours, that they did not intend to stay out long. Mr Benitez claimed the . two women had left Perpignan permanently and gone to Toulouse, but his story was undermined when police recovered the pair's passports in the . family home. Fears were raised when it emerged a former mistress of Benitez had gone missing in 2004 under chillingly similar circumstances. The last sign of life from Benitez’s mistress, the Brazilian Simone de Oliveira Alves, was a text message sent from her phone, telling Benitez she was leaving him. Benitez told police the two had had a fierce argument, which Miss de Oliveira’s sister's Ivana recently suggested could have happened after she discovered Benitez hadn’t yet separated from his wife Marie-Josée. The former mistress's sister even claimed that her she had been pregnant with Benitez’s child at the time she disappeared. Earlier this month authorities opened a judicial probe into Allison and Marie-Josee's disappearance, admitting it had become a source of concern.

Tory plans to force all visitors to the UK to pay a £3,000 bond will be blocked by the Lib Dems, Nick Clegg vowed today. The Deputy Prime Minister vowed to jettison Theresa May’s push to ‘clobber’ tens of thousands of visitors from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria before they are allowed to enter Britain. And in further signs of a coalition rift over immigration, Mr Clegg dismissed the ‘silly’ ad vans warning illegal immigrants in London to ‘go home’ and insisted they would not be rolled out across nationwide. Division: Nick Clegg sought to distance himself from his Tory coalition partners, attacking Home Office plans for a £3,000 bond for all visitors to the UK . Mr Clegg has ordered his party to use their annual conference in Glasgow to launch a series of attacks on their Conservative coalition partners. After attacking a Tory idea to allow firms to fire staff at will, he today claimed the Tories would not ensure the economic recovery was ‘fair’ if left to run the country alone. Other rifts also emerged over wind power and welfare cuts. It comes as a poll shows Lib Dem party members want to forge a power-sharing deal with Labour next time round. Mr Clegg denied holding secret talks with either party ahead of the 2015 election. Controversy: Investigation: The Home Office's 'Go Home' vans were 'silly' and should not be used nationwide, Mr Clegg said . Nick Clegg tried to play down suggestions that he favoured a new coalition with the Tories - but then saved his biggest economic criticism for Labour. The Lib Dem leader is under pressure from party members to forge a power-sharing deal with Labour after the next election. The Independent on Sunday published a poll conducted by the website Liberal Democrat Voice, which found that 39 per cent of activists questioned would prefer a Lib Dem-Labour coalition after 2015, compared with just 15 per cent who favour another coalition with the Conservatives. But challenged over the role the Lib Dems would play working with either party, Mr Clegg claimed Labour left to run the country alone would 'wreck' the economy. But he suggested only that the Tories would not be fair. He told BBC's Andrew Marr programme: 'It is my genuine belief that if you go  back to the bad old days, not of coalition and balanced politics, but either the left or the right dominating government on their own, you will get a recovery that is neither fair nor sustainable. 'I think Labour would wreck the recovery, and under the Conservatives, who don’t have the same commitment to fairness that we do, you’d get the wrong kind of recovery. 'So our message is: coalition is good; what the Liberal Democrats have done in government is good. Let us finish the job, but let us finish it fairly.' But he turned his fire on the Conservatives, vowing to use his power to block tough immigration policies. Home . Secretary Mrs May says she wants to make the immigration system more . ‘selective’ and deter people from ‘overstaying’ once their visitor visa . has expired. In the long-term, she hopes to extend an Australian-style £3,000 bond scheme to also include foreign workers and students but they have become bogged down in coalition wrangling. Asked if he would block the idea, Mr Clegg told BBC1’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘Of course, of course. In a coalition I can stop things. ‘I am absolutely not interested in a bond which becomes an indiscriminate way of clobbering people who want to come to this country and in many respects bring great prosperity and benefits to this country. Of course not. ‘But on immigration let me be clear. Clearly to create a tolerant society people need to have confidence in the way in which the immigration system is run. ‘That’s why I have been outspoken in my view, not just in this coalition government but before we were elected that we have introduce exit checks for instance. ‘But we must at the same time say that an open economy such as ours open to the world has to be welcoming to those who want to come here. ‘They are certainty not going to go ahead on the basis of an indiscriminate bond being applied to all visitors to this country.’ The Lib Dem leader said he was willing to support a targeted bond ‘as an extra discretionary tool for customs officers so where they have doubts  about whether people are going to return  to their home country’. He added: ‘I think one way or another we need to give the public the confidence that if you give someone a visa and say you can be here for five years, two years, three years that is what it means. ‘Otherwise what’s the point of issuing those kind of visas?’ The Home Office has also sent vans displaying billboards warning overstaying migrants ‘Go home, or you'll be picked up and deported’ to tour six London boroughs in July. Tory ministers have made clear their desire to send the vans across the country. But Mr Clegg insisted he would also block that a nationwide campaign: ‘I thought they were a very silly idea, and I said so at the time. ‘I don’t think you inspire public confidence by aimlessly drifting around in vans in North London saying by the way can you go home please.’ The splits on immigration come after the Deputy Prime Minister last night denounced 'bizarre' Tory ideas about employment rights and said only the Lib Dems could speak credibly about creating and defending jobs. Mr Clegg pleaded with his party to unite behind him, as Lembit Opik made fresh calls for the Lib Dem leader to quit. Clash: Ex-Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said it was 'nothing personal' but Nick Clegg has to quit as Lib Dem leader . Writing for MailOnline, ex-MP Mr Opik warned that without a new leader the Lib Dems faced ‘destruction’. In . a damning assessment of the Deputy Prime Minister’s performance, Mr . Opik claims that if the party were a business ‘he’d have been fired a . long ago’. The searing criticism from one of the Lib . Dems’ best known figures comes after peer Lord Oakeshott warned the Lib . Dems could be reduced to just 20 seats at the next election and called . for Mr Clegg to quit. With the party stubbornly stuck at around . 10 per cent in the polls, behind UKIP, there are fears many MPs will be . lost at the 2015 election. Mr Opik, who has called for a new . leader before, warns the party will be lucky to retain half of its 57 . seats with Mr Clegg in charge. He writes: ‘I’ve got nothing against Nick Clegg personally.  It’s purely business. ‘And the truth is, if the Liberal Democrats were a business, he’d have been fired a long ago. ‘No . ‘Chief Executive Officer’ could survive such terrible performance . indicators: a catastrophic decline in membership, a virtual halving of . local Councillors, a dreadful deposit-losing London mayoral result and . the worst poll ratings in over two decades.’ Damning: Vicky Pryce says it is a 'myth' that taxing high value property could be a source of income for the Government . Nick Clegg stepped up calls for higher taxes on the wealthy, as he signalled soaking the rich will be a key demand of the Lib Dems at the next election. He said the party's commitment to a mansion tax on properties over £2 . million, raising £2 billion, sent a signal that 'even though we are . committed to deficit reduction' that would not be achieved entirely . through spending cuts. He told the BBC: 'Taxes and particularly taxes on people . who can afford it, have to play some role in the ongoing effort to . making sure that we complete the job of filling the black hole in the . public finances. 'If the Conservatives don't want to do . that then they need to tell people, and that's part of the debate we . will have to have over the next year-and-a-half, what they will cut - . schools or hospitals or pensions or police or the armed services - to . make up that £2 billion.' However Mr Clegg's plans for a ‘mansion tax’ have been savaged by Vicky Pryce – former wife of disgraced Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne. Ms Pryce says it is a ‘myth’ that taxing homes worth more than £2 million will be a ‘magic source of income’ for the Government. Ms Pryce, who will attend the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, dismisses the whole idea of a . mansion tax, which has been blocked by the Conservatives. In . an article for today’s Mail on Sunday, she says: ‘It is a tax that is . set at an arbitrary level with no  economic justification for that level . or the rate imposed – except to raise a certain amount of money’ and ‘a . mantra for those who feel there is a hidden reservoir of taxes just . waiting to be tapped’. Ms . Pryce also pointedly disagrees with her friend Vince Cable, the Business . Secretary, who has raised fears that Coalition plans for low-deposit . mortgages could lead to a new house price bubble. ‘There are concerns over a housing market bubble – expressed by Vince Cable no less – but I don’t share them,’ she says.","Lib Dem leader reveals coalition split on immigration policy .

A North Carolina police officer fatally shot an unarmed man seeking help after a car accident has been charged with voluntary manslaughter. Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University(FAMU) football player Jonathan Ferrell, 24, crashed his car down an embankment about 2:30 a.m. and then knocked on the door of a nearby residence looking for help, officials said. The homeowner opened the door thinking it was her husband. She closed the door and called 911 when she didn't recognize Mr Ferrell, according to reports. 'Killer': Authorities say Officer Randall Kerrick shot an unarmed man who may have needed help after an auto accident . The woman told police that Mr Ferrell was 'banging on the door viciously,' according to the Charlotte Observer. Arriving officers found Mr Ferrell a short distance from the home, he matched a description given by the homeowner, police said in a statement. Officers approached Mr Ferrell to investigate the original call.The marooned man was shot with a Taser as he ran toward the officers, the statement said. When the Taser did not subdue Mr Ferrell, Officer Randall Kerrick drew his weapon and fired multiple shots at the unarmed former football player - he was soon pronounced dead at the scene, the statement continued. Victim: Jonathan Ferrell, 24, may have been seeking help when he was shot by police . After discovering the wrecked vehicles, authorities determined that Ferrell was potentially seeking help from the homeowner when she called 911, according to WSOC. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Rodney Monroe said during a Saturday news conference that the accident was serious and Ferrell would have been forced to climb out of the back window of the vehicle, WSOC reported. He apparently walked to the nearest house and banged on the door. Officials do not think Ferrell made threats or tried to rob the woman, said Mr Monroe. 'I don't believe threats were made,' the chief noted. Mr Kerrick, 27, has turned himself in to face the charges, according to reports. Ferrell knocked on this door looking for help after being in a car crash, but the homeowner called 911 . 'He is pretty shook up,' Chief Monroe noted. 'He's devastated.' Mr Kerrick has been with Charlotte-Mecklenburg police since April 2011. Monroe said at a news conference that . Kerrick was in custody. Police say he was charged with voluntary . manslaughter after an investigation found that the shooting was . excessive. 'The investigation showed that the subsequent shooting of Mr. Ferrell was excessive,' police said, adding that 'Kerrick did not have a lawful right to discharge his weapon during this encounter.' Mr Ferrell has just recently moved to Charlotte after leaving FAMU, records showed. He played safety during the 2009 and 2010 season, according to interim athletic director Michael Smith. 'Our hearts and prayers go out to his family during their time of bereavement,' Mr Smith said. It is not clear what caused the crash, officials said, a separate investigation into the accident is still ongoing. Two other officers at the scene have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a probe into the shooting, according to the station.","Jonathan Ferrell appears to have crashed .

Across all 43 forces in England and Wales, a total of 249 officers and 171 civilian staff faced discipline for computer misuse. However, many forces would not say how many involved the PNC.

Five foolhardy thieves were today jailed for more than three decades after 40 anti-tank mines were stolen from a Ministry of Defence freight train. The raid was ‘opportunistic’ and the gang of six men soon realised they were ‘out of their depth’ when they discovered they had stolen a stash of powerful explosives in Cheshire, police said. The munitions - which were fortunately being transported without detonators - were on a train which left Cumbria at around 11.30am on October 24 last year. Jailed: Phillip Yates (left), 29, pleaded guilty to theft and possessing explosives. Leonard Ash (right), 50, of Birkenhead, was found guilty after a trial of handling stolen goods and possessing explosives and offences . Ten packages, each containing four mines, were reported stolen shortly after 7.30am the following day when the train arrived at Didcot, Oxfordshire - and an investigation was launched. Counter-terrorism officers were sent to various sites along the journey where the train had stopped Investigators searched a site in Dallam near Warrington, Cheshire. The train had made an unscheduled stop due to a red signal at 12.40am. It had stayed there for 16 minutes. When officers arrived to check the area, they had already been told of damaged fencing. CCTV footage was examined and showed three figures near to the fencing at 12.51am and a van which drove away at 12.58am, a sentencing hearing at Liverpool Crown Court heard. At 5pm on October 26, 28 of the 40 missing mines were discovered in undergrowth by a nearby rail embankment. Behind bars: Jason McKee (left), 27, of Merseyside, was found guilty of handling stolen goods and possessing explosives. Kris Black (right), 23, from Birkenhead, pleaded guilty to theft and possessing explosives . Information then came in to the police suggesting that Philip Yates from Birkenhead and Michael Hellon from Sheffield may have been involved in the theft. Sentenced: Michael Hellon, 31, of Sheffield, was found guilty of handling stolen goods and possessing explosives . When officers went to see the two suspects they admitted they knew about the theft but tried to deny their involvement. They were arrested and Yates drew a map for officers to illustrate where the missing munitions could be found. At 3.45am on October 29, officers went to an area near Storeton Woods on the Wirral. There, submerged in water at the bottom of a drain, specially trained Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) officers safely recovered 11 of the missing 12 mines. Further enquiries indicated that the last missing mine was at a garage on Quarry Bank in Birkenhead. When EOD officers arrived, they confirmed an attempt had been made to dismantle the mine, with explosive materials being cut up with a circular saw into more than a dozen different blocks. Police officers also recovered a handgun and ammunition. Enquiries showed that Hellon was researching the anti-tank mines as early as October 25, and passing information on to Yates, police said. Phillip Yates, 29, Kris Black, 23, both from Birkenhead, and David Ian Smith, 30, of Liverpool, all pleaded guilty to theft and possessing explosives.

Picture shows him looking on as he takes a picture of his daughter on the catwalk . The father of a beauty queen who disappeared without trace along with her mother was found hanged Monday in his French Foreign Legion barracks, judicial sources said. Francisco Benitez, chief warrant officer in charge of recruitment in the Foreign Legion, was discovered in the barracks where he worked in the southwestern city of Perpignan, a source close to the case said. His daughter Allison, 19, and his wife Marie-Josee Benitez, 53, disappeared on July 14 and have not been seen since, local assistant prosecutor Luc-Andre Lenormand said. Benitez, a Spaniard who was granted French nationality, left a letter and video behind, and also sent emails to his parents, bosses and friends to tell them he could not stand the suspicions weighing on him. He said he was innocent and declared his love for his daughter, sources close to the case said. The two women's disappearance was initially treated as a simple missing persons case - one of the tens of thousands such incidents that take place every year in France - especially as husband and wife were separating. But on Friday, authorities opened a judicial probe into their disappearance, admitting it had become a source of concern. 'We can imagine the worst,' Lenormand said. According to Benitez's previous statements to the police, the two women left their home on July 14 with suitcases, without any explanation. They said they were going to the nearby city of Toulouse. But from then on, their mobile phones were turned off and they took no money out of their accounts.

"By . Liz Jones . PUBLISHED: . 16:13 EST, 8 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:14 EST, 8 September 2013 . Switching on breakfast television last week, I was startled to see Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman discussing a 'school's initiative' of which she's part. At first, I thought that instead of jetting around the world attending fashion shows in new season heavily discounted or free designer gear, Ms Shulman herself would be making appearances at comprehensive schools the length and breadth of the land. But no, it turns out that all Vogue is doing is sending out a video and lesson plan to schools for teachers of Year Nine pupils (aged 13 to 14) to use in order to unravel, explain and put into context the smoke and mirrors that go into the making of its glossy pages. In Vogue: Kate Moss on holiday (right) and on the cover of the June issue . Or rather to peddle its wares in a scheme perfectly timed to coincide with the latest round of international fashion shows. Let me unveil just what Vogue's curriculum consists of. Shulman's lesson plan asks that teachers tell students that 'only a very small percentage of the population have the natural build and appearance of a model'. It details each stage of a fashion magazine shoot. It lists, too, for teachers to read out unquestioningly, the diverse, 'normal' people who have been shot by Vogue, including Adele - without mentioning that the magazine failed to show any other part of her body than her carefully airbrushed head! It is, frankly, laughable. What all this amounts to is not Vogue admitting that it needs to evolve, and respect its readers a little more. Instead, they are asking young women to change their response to what they see in Vogue - to change a response that is often visceral, emotional and unwitting. Shulman says the pictures in her magazine 'aspire and entertain', but she's being disingenuous. They are designed to sell things. If readers were to disbelieve the dream they were sold - that if they wear a certain dress, they, too, will look like a model, and get a boyfriend, and find happiness - then Vogue would go out of business. It's as simple as that. Laughable: Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman on breakfast TV last week - her 'school's initiative' reveals how little the magazine respects its readers . I don't buy Shulman's premise that what Vogue, and other magazines, designers, photographers and post-production studio wizards are doing is fantasy, and somehow to be separated from real life. Fashion is seductive and convincing. It chip, chip, chips away at our self-esteem. Not every young woman's self-esteem, of course. If you have a protective bubble of a loving family, and good friends, and eagle-eyed teachers, then you have a chance to repel these images, like a very good Burberry mac. But for Shulman to say 'the problem, if there is a problem, comes when people judge themselves against the models they see on the pages of a magazine and then feel that in some way they fall short' is staggering. I know from experience that even being fully aware of the reality behind these images - seeing first hand that models have thread veins and acne, that images can be airbrushed, with heads being placed on entirely different bodies (it's revealed in the short film that it takes 20 professionals to produce one photo) - does not help. It cannot reverse what has been affected in the deepest part of your brain, the reptilian cortex buried inside your head, that 'does not respond to talking therapies' (thank you, Janet Treasure, professor in psychiatry at Guy's Hospital). And the rational part of your brain, the bit that understands Kate Moss doesn't really look as she does on the June cover of Vogue, cannot override the subconscious that says you simply do not measure up. I was taught to hate my body by an industry that I loved, but that never loved me back. It's crushing to see my story being repeated, over and over again, by girls coming after me, who believe the same lies that Shulman repeats in this new film: oh, it's fantasy, you are not supposed to want to look like these cover girls, they are just an escape, not an aspiration. Yes, we do need education about this sort of thing in schools. But not from the gamekeepers, the very people who have so much to lose from opening our eyes to their sophistry. Small and quiet: Diane Von Furstenberg's shop scores well . The legendary Diane von Furstenberg is celebrating 40 years of the wrap dress next year with a new, capsule collection for spring 2014. Actually, the wrap dress was really born in 1972 (who says designers were ever good at sums). It was inspired by the needs of the feminist movement: light and made of unwrinkling silk jersey, the wrap worked in the office, was easily squished into a suitcase, and could be put on or stepped out of in seconds. 'Simplicity and sexiness, that's what people want. At a price that's not outrageous,' DvF told Vogue in 1976. When I visit, the shop is small and quiet, with polite, eager sales assistants, and a couple of customers whose faces have been pulled taut. The thing is, today the wrap dress - meant to be worn over a tan and cowboy boots, with Jerry Hall's hair and the sheen of youth - has instead been adopted by Everywoman, and can be frumpy if you don't accessorise it with killer heels. There are lots of variations on offer here, priced from £300 to £500, but the most ubiquitous seem to be in leopard or snake print. I like the fact a designer has a USP, and sticks to it: DvF's body con dresses and lace shifts work less well. And, of course, you can buy variations on the wrap everywhere, from Issa to Asos. DvF only loses one point  for the very pedestrian,  sub-LK Bennett shoes. LIZ'S VERDICT: 9/10 .","New 'school's initiative' to teach girls what goes into making glossy images .

It's as indicative of an English summer as the first swallow or the scent of mown grass. I have been looking forward to this new series - the fourth - as keenly as if it were a hot man and a first date. In fact, don’t even bother asking me on a date on a Tuesday night from now on, because I will be glued to the telly, lost in a safe, mummy world of greaseproof paper, icing sugar and floral fairy-cake cases. Home comforts: Bake Off judge Mary Berry, left, reminds Liz Jones of her mother Edna . The only challenge will be whether the oven was hot enough or the crème patissiere has curdled. Will Mary Berry be in an outrageous outfit from Topshop that will do more for the British economy than any amount of quantitative easing? Will her fellow judge Paul Hollywood have mellowed and managed to use less hair gel? The Great British Bake Off is like a drug, and I can't get enough of it. Already my head is brimming with palette knives, cake tins and different types of nut. But the thing is, I'm the nut. I have never cooked a cake on my own in my life. I have never owned a bag of flour or a wooden spoon. A rolling pin would be as unusual a sight in my immaculate home as a sofa from DFS. Food has been as absent in my life as a man who loves me and children. I am starting to realise that my life of abstention from calories is not entirely unrelated to the fact my life is now about loneliness. I am thin, but I am unhappy. I have a stainless steel kitchen island, but it is unscratched. A bit like me: pristine but sterile. In case you are unfamiliar with my neuroses, let me enlighten you. Can't cook, won't cook: Liz has never baked a cake in her life . I have been an anorexic since the age of 11 when my mum approached me with a breakfast in bed of warm, buttered toast and marmalade, and I shrank - fuelled by 19 magazine's calorie-counter - as if I were Superwoman faced with Kryptonite. I grew up on Cosmo magazine, believing women were supposed to have careers, not cookers. I have never owned a recipe book in my life, believing that my mum, who was a housewife and cooked everything for her seven children from scratch, was a martyr - a slave to mixing (the only appliance she owned was a hand whisk, with a handle she had to turn) and washing-up (we never owned a dishwasher or a washing machine). 'I vowed, aged 11, I would never cook a thing for myself, nor for a man. And, on the whole, I haven't' As a teenager, my mum would proudly parade fairy cakes, rock cakes, chocolate sponges and a Christmas cake with rough icing she said was 'a snowstorm', crowned with a Santa whose red trousers became more pink as the years went by. In return, I would lambast her every time she approached me with a floral plate and a teeny fork and an anxious face. Don't offer me that rubbish! I don't want to spend my life with a face flushed red from a range - I want a career! It is anti-feminist to own a pastry brush! And my mum and her morsels would retreat, deflated. I vowed, aged 11, I would never cook a thing for myself, nor for a man. And, on the whole, I haven't. Men would have to love me for who I am, what I do, not for how I filled their stomachs. Back on Tuesday evenings; Liz loves the eccentricity of the Great British Bake Off . I was too good to be covered in flour. I wanted to go to aerobics class and lift weights, not whisk and beat until my muscles ached. At school I even rebelled in domestic science, saying the tea towels smelled and turned my stomach. And, in any case, I was a vegan, and cream oppressed animals. Just as I was excused biology, for refusing to dissect a once-living creature, I was excused cooking and told to take extra sewing classes instead. Cooking, to me, spelled being fat, and that was the last thing I wanted to be. Cooking spelled mess, which, as an OCD sufferer, was as unwelcome as herpes to a hooker. Even today, faced with the choice of toast and crumbs or nothing, I will choose the latter. But somehow, I just cannot get my fill of the Great British Bake Off. 'Mary Berry, who oozes safety and forgiveness. Nothing bad could happen while she is in charge' Perhaps the fact that the hit BBC2 series is filmed in a marquee has something to do with my addiction. A marquee, with its unique smell and diffused light, reminds me of the horticultural shows of my youth, when I always entered the Dress A Wooden Spoon competition and failed. Or perhaps it is reminiscent of weddings where the groom loves the bride and doesn’t slope off to spend time with his mates before cheating on his new wife. Perhaps, too, I love this programme because of the contestants, who are hapless and normal, don't seem to care about their waistlines and have families to call excitedly with news after every triumph and failure. This programme to me is like porn: a fantasy world not of sex, but of families and normality and comfort and fires and messy kitchens. I never have anyone to call when things have gone wrong or right, or when I land at Heathrow Airport after yet another long, dusty, lonely assignment abroad. This programme reeks of home. Most of all, though, I love TGBBO because of Mary Berry, who oozes safety and forgiveness. Nothing bad could happen while Mary is in charge. Baker's dozen: The latest contestants are all 'hapless and normal' She reminds me so much of my mum, who spent her life baking but who is now so ill and disabled she can only be given syringed warm water from a pipette. I want my mum back, but in the meantime I have Mary. I want to tell my mum I am sorry I rejected her Victoria sponge in favour of fitting into a size six pair of brown trousers. 'Maybe I would be a nicer person, more content, if I owned an apron' I remember the Sunday afternoon she begged me to eat a Yorkshire pudding because I had been awake all night, delirious, unable to even form sentences, so emaciated was I, so insane from the anorexia, and I dashed the hot, fatty pan to the floor. She didn't admonish or berate me, but merely said she would fix me a poached tomato on Nimble bread instead. Does the new series of TGBBO disappoint? Is it as flat as a meringue that has been whisked too vigorously, or my own deflated breasts? The hell it is! The moment Paul says 'Welcome to yeast' to the eager contestants, you know that all is right in the world. There is a new baker's dozen of contestants to roll around the tongue. Summer fete feel: Liz loves the fact the show is set in a marquee . Among them are Ruby, the student with the startling blue eyes and a desire to please; Rob, who designs space satellites and is crowned master baker for the very first time; Deb, the dentist for people with special needs (was there ever a more holistic job description?); and Glenn, the sixth-form teacher who is as big as a house. The comfort, the normality, oozes from them. A cake is deemed to have 'gone a bit pottery class' because Mark the carpenter forgot to pre-heat the oven. But other than that, all is right in this big old scary world. Which surely makes a nice change. Meeting her heroine: Liz with Mary . For the opening show of this series, Mary was wearing last summer's Whistles floral blazer, which tells me she has her priorities in order, and, like my mum, was brought up during the war when there were more important things to worry about than being able to buy the new Willow bag from Mulberry. She is frugal, not vain. Just like my mum. And I learn stuff from the Bake Off: to 'temper' is to cool chocolate, not fly into a mood. Maybe I would be a nicer person, more content, if I owned an apron. Maybe when a man comes for the weekend I could get out the whisk. I might even contemplate buying a loose-bottomed tin and worry less about my own bottom. I might even download the recipes and dream of the perfect Angel Food cake. The Great British Bake Off works in the same way Downton Abbey does: it is a British fete on a warm afternoon. It's not cool, it's not PC, it's a bit cheesy. But it is fabulous. Even for women like me.","Liz has never baked but she loves the show .

A South Korean fisherman kidnapped by North Korea 41 years ago has managed to pull off a daring escape and has been reunited with his family in Seoul. No details of how Jeon Wook-pyo, now 68, managed to escape from the secretive North but most who have made it across the border - either by land or across a river into China - risk being shot by guards. It was in 1972 when Jeon was serving as one of 25 crewmen manning two South Korean boats that they were all captured by North Korean sailors in the Yellow Sea. Free: Jeon Wook-pyo wrote to President Park Geun-hye earlier this month asking for her help, telling her he had escaped because he misses his family and friends . A spokesman for the Abductees' Family Union, based in Seoul, said Jeon managed to flee from the North early last month. 'He is the only crewman from those two boats to have escaped,' said the spokesman, Choi Sung-yung. On his arrival in Seoul, Jeon was taken to a safe house by South Korean security officials and questioned about his life in the enemy North - what is expected to be the first of a series of debriefings. A black and white photograph released earlier this month by Choi Sung-yong shows a 1974 photo of 36 South Korean fishermen grouped together on North Korea's Mount Myohyang, among them Jeon Wook-pyo, whose name was also spelt as Chun. Thirty-six South Korean fishermen abducted by North Korea, including Jeon, pose together on Mount Myohyang in North Korea in 1974 . Revealing his escape from the . security of a 'safe country' - believed to be China - after he had . crossed over the border, Jeon wrote to South Korea's President Park . Geun-hye asking for help. He . told her he had risked his life to escape because he missed his family . and friends in the South more and more and wished to spent his remaining . years with them and be buried there. It . is believed that Seoul's security officials will want to firmly . establish that Jeon has not been indoctrinated with the mind-set of the . Stalinist North and will take every opportunity to spy on the South. They . would also want to ensure that the escaped man really was Jeon - and . not an elderly North Korean intelligence agent using his identity. People who have escaped from the North in the past have claimed that a large number of spies are operating in South Korea, some having been 'allowed' to escape in order to carry out their intelligence work. Seoul officials estimate that at least 3,800 South Koreans have been kidnapped by North Korea since the Korean War of 1950-53. The main purpose was to question them about the way of life in the South so that North Korean spies could easily infiltrate cities when on undercover missions. Mr Kim Hyung-suk, spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry confirmed today that Jeon had safely returned to the South, but gave no other details about his escape. Mr Choi, whose own father, a seaman, was kidnapped by North Korea in 1967 - never to return - says his family union group has managed to smuggle at least seven South Koreans back to their country via China.","Jeon Wook-pyo, now 68, is thought to have crossed the border to China .

Three friends of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges that they hindered the investigation into the deadly attack. Authorities allege that the friends went to Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth three days after the bombings, soon after the FBI released photographs of Tsarnaev and his older brother. The friends are accused in an indictment of removing several items from the room, including Tsarnaev's laptop computer and a backpack containing fireworks. Accused: Robel Philipos, second from left, and Dias Kadyrbayev, right, at their arraignment on Friday . One friend, Robel Phillipos, 19, of Cambridge, was indicted last month on two counts of lying to authorities while he was being questioned. His lawyers declined to comment after the brief arraignment in U.S. District Court but said in a statement that Phillipos 'had nothing to do whatsoever with the Boston Marathon bombing or destroying any evidence'. 'In the end, it will be clear that this prosecution should never have been brought in the first place,' Derege Demissie and Susan Church said in the statement. Authorities allege that 20-year-old Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan, 26, ethnic Chechens from Russia, planned and carried out twin bombings near the finish of the marathon on April 15. Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured. Hearing: Azamat Tazhayakov, center, and his attorney appear in court . Charges: Robel Phillipos leaves federal court, where he pleaded not guilty to charges that he hindered the Boston bombing investigation . Tamerlan died in a gun battle with police as authorities closed in on the brothers several days after the bombings. Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, both Kazakhstan nationals, are charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. All four men attended the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Robert Stahl, an attorney for Kadyrbayev, said his client was 'shocked and horrified' by the bombings and had 'no intent' to obstruct justice. 'I'm saying he didn't dispose of evidence, didn't understand it was evidence, and the rest will come out at trial,' Mr Stahl said after the arraignment. More than two dozen family members and friends attended the hearing to support Phillipos. During an argument for bail in May, his lawyer portrayed him as a frightened and confused young man who was subjected to intense interrogation. Tazhayakov's parents and sister were in . court during the brief arraignment. A translator said the family . traveled from Kazakhstan in April and plan to remain in the U.S. until . the case is resolved. Bomb suspects: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, left, and his brother Tamerlan, who died in a gun fight with police . Tazhayakov's attorney, Nicholas Wooldridge, said the government 'rushed into things' by charging his client. 'This is a witch hunt,' Mr Wooldridge said after his arraignment. All three men are due back in court on October 29. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Capin said he expects to call about 20 witnesses during a two-week trial.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:33 EST, 14 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:33 EST, 14 September 2013 . A new book makes shocking new claims that 'coked-up' members of the New York Knicks' 1981-1982 team fixed games for their drug dealer, who bet thousands of dollars on the team in the midst of their terrible season. Brian Tuohy's new book, Larceny Games: Sports Gambling, Game Fixing and the FBI, cites FBI sources who said they investigated whether three members of the team - who were said to be 'heavy users of cocaine' - were involved in a point-shaving scheme to benefit their supplier, who is identified only as 'one of the largest dealers on the East Coast.' According to Tuohy's FBI sources, the dealer was known as a degenerate sports gambler who typically bet $300 a game on NBA games. When it appeared he had his hooks in some of the Knicks players - in roughly January of 1982 - the dealer began upping his bets to $10,000, often betting against the Knicks to win or cover the spread. Cheaters: Brian Tuohy's book Larceny Games outlines an FBI investigation into whether Knicks players shaved points to help their drug dealer . By March of 1982, the dealer had won six of the seven large bets he'd made against the Knicks - all while continuing to bet his regular $300 on games in which the Knicks were not playing. 'Over...the last two months, all three [players] have given...tips on when to bet the Knicks to lose. This has occurred seven times and six of the tips were good,' according to FBI files citing two unnamed sources.' Simultaneously, the FBI began to suspect that the three Knicks players were 'betting against themselves,' with one of the men owing a 'large...gambling debt' to a bookie with the Luchese crime family. 'So many people say it’s impossible to fix a game because guys are paid so much money,' Tuohy told The New York Post. 'But you can see how easily they can get hooked on some drug, be gambling themselves and get in deep with a bookie.' Addict: Michael Ray Richardson is suspected of possibly being one of the players who cheated, a charge he denies . Banned: Richardson was banned from the NBA for life in 1986 but now coaches a Canadian team . Point-shaving in basketball involves a player intentionally playing bad to make the final score closer than it otherwise would be, which helps gamblers beat the spread and win the bet. At first, FBI agents didn't think the trio was actually shaving points, rather, 'extending a courtesy to their cocaine dealer regarding inside player information.' As the dealer continued to be successful, in about March of 1982, FBI agents noted that a 'source now believes that the players are actively engaging in ""shaving points"" and possibly even betting against themselves.' 'Source observed heavy betting by [redacted] toward the latter part of the season...on the Knicks to lose certain games. In each case, the Knicks did lose, or failed to cover the point spread,' the FBI file reads. The names of the players are redacted from the report, but one of those suspected of possibly being involved in the alleged point-shaving scheme is guard Michael Ray Richardson, who was banned from the NBA for life in 1986 for violating the league's drug policy three times. Coach: Some on the team attribute the poor performance to a lack of leadership from coach Red Holzman . Richardson averaged 18 points a game, despite a rumored cocaine problem. When the team finished in last in the Atlantic Division - after going 33-49 in the regular season - Richardson was quoted as saying 'the ship be sinking.' Richardson - who now coaches the London Lightning in the NBL in Canada - denies that he was ever involved in a point-shaving scheme, telling the Post 'hell no...we never did anything like that.' Others blame the poor performance on the leadership of coach Red Holzman, who players have said didn't do much to motivate his players. 'At times the coach was a little lax, and he didn’t put enough pressure . on those guys [to play harder],' said Alex Bradley, a Knicks rookie during the season in question. 'At certain times, when we needed to turn it up, it . just wasn’t there.' Tuohy, however, doesn't buy it. 'It was no coincidence,' he said when asked about other possible explanations for the teams atrocious season.","The FBI looked into whether three members of the Knick's 1982 team helped shave points to help their cocaine dealer win bets .

An 84-year-old dementia sufferer was left without food or water for five days when her operation was repeatedly cancelled. Irene Lowe was put on a strict nil-by-mouth regime as she prepared to undergo surgery on a broken shoulder. But when her surgery was cancelled five times she became so dehydrated that she ended up on a drip. Irene Lowe, 84, was left without food or water for five days at University Hospital of North Staffordshire (pictured). She was told she couldn't eat or drink before surgery but the operation was cancelled five times . The operation, at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, was put off because the specialist consultants due to carry it out were unavailable. The grandmother was still in hospital yesterday, 18 days after she broke her shoulder in a fall at her home in Longton, Staffordshire, on August 25. The operations were cancelled between August 30 and September 3 - she finally went under the knife on September 4. Her furious daughter, Christine Barnes, 52, has criticised hospital staff who left her feeling like the treatment was ‘a joke’. Ms Barnes, from Dresden, Staffordshire, said: 'The operation kept being cancelled because emergencies kept coming in from as far away as Wrexham. Mrs Lowe became so dehydrated that she eventually had to be put on a drip. Her surgery was carried out on the sixth day she was in hospital. She is now recovering . ‘I understand that, but why was an 84-year-old lady left with no food or water for so long, it made her ill. ‘My mother fasted from midnight on the Thursday, all the next day, only to be told the operation was cancelled at 7pm. Mrs Lowe's operation was cancelled repeatedly because her surgeons kept being required to deal with emergency cases . ‘On Saturday, they let her have a light breakfast, then she fasted again, with no food or water, but the same thing happened again. ‘On Sunday, it was the same and she had to go on a drip, because she was so dehydrated. ‘The same thing happened on Monday and Tuesday before she finally went had the operation on Wednesday.’ Mrs Barnes’ sister Caroline Knight, 58, from Trentham, Staffordshire, said: ‘My mother was distraught. ‘Even on the Wednesday the operation nearly didn’t happen. It only went ahead because we were complaining.’ Trish Rowson, associate chief nurse, said: 'Due to the complex nature of the surgery Mrs Lowe required it was necessary for a consultant surgeon specialising in shoulder surgery to be present. 'Unfortunately, our specialist consultants can be called to urgent cases at very short notice and this affects patients awaiting surgery. 'This unfortunate delay has thankfully not affected the clinical outcome for Mrs Lowe and we would like to wish her well with her on-going recovery. 'I would be very willing to meet with Mrs Lowe and her family to offer our sincere apologies regarding this delay and the timing of fasting.'","Irene Lowe, 84, broke her shoulder in a fall at home .

So imagine the shock of a walker who saw one as he strolled by a river ten miles from the sea. Jody Gibbons, 27, filmed the 5ft-long shark on his mobile phone as it circled in shallow water at the weekend. Thought to be a harmless smooth-hound shark, it probably swam up the River Stour from mouth of the estuary, where they are commonly found, before becoming trapped behind a sluice gate after the tide went out. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shark: Jody Gibbons spotted the creature, believed to be a Smooth-hound shark, while walking with his father along the River Stour in Essex . Jaws: Mr Gibbons spotted the shark when he saw a fin sticking out of the water . The 27-year-old marketing executive . grabbed his phone to capture video footage of the shark so his friends . would believed he had seen it in the village of Cattawade. He said: 'We walked past and saw a big fin sticking up out of the water and thought ""that must be a big fish"". 'That thought quickly became ""that's a massive fish"" and then I realised it was a shark. I really could not believe what I was seeing. 'We have walked along there so many times before but never had I seen anything like that before.' It is believed to be a Smooth-hound Shark, which is more commonly found in coastal waters around the country. Proof: Jody Gibbons (left) said he wanted to make sure he filmed the shark (right) because he feared his friends would not believe he had seen it . Coast: According to the Shark Trust there are 35 species of shark that can be found around the coastal waters of Britain . Mr Gibbons, of Lawford, Essex, spent more than an hour with his college lecturer father, 53, watching the shark on Sunday. There are more than 30 species of sharks which regulary inhabit the coasts of Britain. According to The Shark Trust, at least 21 of these can be found on the UK coastline all year round. Among those that can be spotted throughout the year are the Smallspotted Catshark and the Basking Shark. There have also been sightings of a range of other sharks, including just last week when a pack of killer blue sharks were seen off the coast of Cornwall. While the species is normally confined to the mid-Atlantic, diver Nick Robertson-Brown spotted the pack just five miles from the coast. Meanhwile, MailOnline has today also reported on fisherman Wayne Comben who battled for two hours to reel in one of the biggest sharks ever caught in British waters. Mr Comben, along with fellow angler Graeme Pullen, caught the 14ft thresher shark about a mile south of St Catherine’s Point on the Isle of Wight. He has given a 'conservative' estimate that the shark was at least 4ft long but thinks it could have been as long as 5ft. He . added: 'It was an amazing sight to see and I knew I had to film it, . otherwise my friends would not have believed a word I was saying. 'The water was quite shallow where we saw it and its fin was sticking out of the water - it was like a scene from Jaws. 'You do get people fishing here and there is a beach further up the river but it's surprising to find a shark.' Mr Gibbons informed the Environment Agency and the RSPCA of his sighting. He said: 'We got really close to it . and could see it was as long as some metal railings in the water so we . had a good gauge to work out how big it was. 'I really was shocked and amazed - I did not for one minute expect to see something like that in the river. 'It was just fascinating watching it swimming around.' David .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 04:38 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:25 EST, 22 April 2013 . Britain’s housing crisis could be solved by the humble bungalow, according researchers at David Cameron’s favourite think tank. Planning rules must be torn up to . encourage developers to move away from tiny box flats to investing in . low level living, Policy Exchange said. But today it emerged that government reforms designed to stimulate the construction industry had actually slowed down the planning system. Low level living: The popularity of the bungalow, like this show house in Maidstone in Kent, soared in the 1930s and 40s but just 300-a-year are now built . It is thought more single storey houses . would persuade older people to downsize, freeing up more family homes . and kick-starting the housing market. It could even stop people . emigrating from the UK. Almost a third of people say they would prefer to live in a bungalow but they account for just one in 50 of all properties across the country. Four years ago just 300 bungalows were built in the UK. Policy Exchange believes planning rules which demanded at least 30 homes be built on every hectare of land made bungalows unviable. It calls for councils to lose control over granting planning permission, instead allowing local people to decide what can and cannot be built in their town or village. Residents could be more willing to support a wave of new bungalows, because they are less likely to impact on views. In 1923 the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition featured a Bungalow Town, which took over a whole floor of the show . The government's attempts to shake-up the planning system have proven controversial. Moves to allow homeowners to buold larger extensions without permission hit the buffers after opposition from Tory MPs. Now figures show that fewer planning applications have been given the go ahead since the coalition introduced its new National Planning Policy Framework. Among developments of 10 or fewer homes, just 68 per cent were given approval within eight weeks in 2012, down from 71 per cent in 2011. For larger developments it has fallen from 60 per cent to 57 per cent for the target of approval within 13 weeks. Labour’s shadow planning minister Roberta Blackman-Woods told the Daily Telegraph: 'In reality planning applications are now taking longer to decide and, unsurprisingly given planning was never the brake on growth the Government claimed it was, the economy is still flatlining. 'Following the Government’s botched planning reforms we have a situation in which many areas are unprotected by local plans, Labour’s brown field first policy has been fundamentally weakened and key environmental protections are being ripped up. 'We were sold all of this on the basis that it would speed up planning and boost the economy.' The bungalow has been a regular feature at the Ideal Home Show in Olympia, Kensington since it began in 1908 . Now the government is being urged to encourage developers to build more bungalows to inject demand into the housing market. The idea of using bungalows to solve a housing problem is not new. The term is thought to date back to 1659, an anglicised version of a single-storey Indian hut called a 'bangala' used to house English sailors. Britain's first bungalow was built by Colonel Bragg who erected a lodge with Indian features in Norwood in London in the 1860s. In 1882 pre-Raphaelite artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti became one of the first people in England to die in a bungalow. They took off in the early 20th century in the UK and America when they were adopted by the Arts and Crafts movement. Fashionable for much of the first half of the century, they featured widely in the Ideal Home Exhibition. Bungalows became more popular in Britain after the First World War, with thousands of prefabricated properties built during and after the Second World War to house returning soldiers and their families. They were updated with more stylish designs in the 1960s and 1970s, which have not dated well. A best-selling book in the 1970s was Bungalow Bliss, a self-build guide by Frank MacDonald. Bungalows are said to be most popular in Wales, where up to 35 per cent of people say it is their dream home of choice. At the height of the 2007 financial crash it emerged that bungalows had held their value better than conventional houses. By June 2008 detached homes had dropped by 1.5 per cent and flats 2.9 per cent, but bungalows were down by only 0.6 per cent. Older people who are reluctant to move . out of family homes, even when children have moved away, could be . persuaded to downsize to bungalows as a preferred way of living, the . think tank believes. Alex Morton, head of housing and planning at Policy Exchange, said ‘What is needed is a grand bargain between the generations. ‘More homes, tailored to the needs of older homeowners, will help free up family sized properties for the younger generation. ‘It’s unsurprising that many of our talented men and women are making new lives for themselves outside the UK. We must reform the planning system to get Britain building more homes. ‘This has to include more bungalows which will allow older people to downsize to a property that suits their specific needs.’ The new study -  Housing and Intergenerational Fairness – points to a 2002 study which found that 30 per cent of people said they would like to live in a bungalow. ‘This preference is even stronger for older people,’ the report added. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment noted: ‘The majority of house buyers are unlikely to initially choose to live in higher density developments... Older people say they would prefer a bungalow.’ Surveys by Halifax also reveal bungalows to be Britain’s ‘happiest homes’, with people favouring the ‘facilities such as security, cleaning and ease of use’. The Policy Exchange report added: ‘If thirty per cent of people’s ideal home is a bungalow, and this preference is even stronger for older people, it make no sense to prevent construction of bungalows if we are interested in increasing the housing supply and a more efficient use of the existing housing stock. ‘Older people currently living in large family homes might want to downsize to a bungalow, which is smaller and easier to maintain, as well as being on one floor and offering outside space. ‘There are huge numbers of spare rooms in homes older people are currently living in. What are needed are the homes that older people like and so would like to move into. ‘But planning policy prevents these homes from being built – and this is before we even begin to discuss the fact that higher land prices caused by our planning system would in any case mitigate against building bungalows.’ The Prime Minister's official spokesman said he did not know if David Cameron's views on bungalows but insisted the government was committed to a raft of measures to boost the housing market. This Hallmark 'Sussex Bungalow' from 1963 was designed to recast the bungalow as being at the cutting edge of modern living . The Policy Exchange think tank believes a new wave of bungalows could help to solve the housing crisis, by encouraging older people who live in large family homes to downsize . A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘We are pulling out all the stops to get more homes built for all generations and we're determined that good design will be the cornerstone of that. ‘Our reforms are making the planning system much more accessible and by putting local decisions centre stage we are encouraging development that protects our countryside and responsible building. ‘The new neighbourhood planning powers we've introduced ensure that local communities decide on the homes they want in their area. These changes are already paying off with a number of plans looking to provide more homes for the older generation.’ Almost a third of people say they would prefer to live in a bungalow but very few have been built since the boom in the 1940s when prefabricated homes went up quickly . Bungalows are still popular on the Norfolk Broads and in large parts of Wales . The style of bungalows has been updated over the years, with many designed by owners as self-build projects . Last week the government was forced to u-turn on plans to overhaul the planning system. Homeowners will keep the right to complain about neighbours’ plans for large extensions. The move is a major climbdown after David Cameron last year promised ‘fast-track’ applications to kick-start the economy through building. Property-owners were to be given the right to extend as far as 26ft without planning permission or opposition from adjacent families, but Conservative and Liberal Democrat backbenchers warned it would pit ‘neighbour against neighbour’. A revised scheme means homeowners will still have to notify their local council.","More single-story homes would encourage older people to downsize .

A four-year-old has been diagnosed with a fatal brain tumour after falling over and bumping his head. After the accident, a precautionary hospital scan revealed that Jayden Wilson had not injured himself, but that he had a grade four tumour. His parents have been told that he has just a year to live. Jayden (pictured with his parents, Lou and Mike, and his sister, Ella) was diagnosed with a brain tumour after banging his head. He had a precautionary scan that showed a mass in his brain . Jayden was given the CT scan hours after a fall two weeks ago, and following the discovery of a mass on his brain, he was transferred to a hospital specialising in brain surgery. After an MRI scan and biopsy, doctors told his mother, Lou, and father, Mike, that he has cancer. After what they described as the ‘worst weeks of our lives’ the couple are now fundraising to make the rest of Jayden’s life full of special days. Not much has changed for the lively four-year-old since the fall on August 28. He has started at a new school, has played with his favourite Lego, and spent precious moments with his parents and older sister Ella, at their home in Basingstoke. Mr Wilson, a professional freerunner who has featured in films including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Pirates of the Caribbean, said: ‘We are staying very positive and are meeting doctors to decide the way forward.’ After his scan, Jayden was referred to Southampton Children's Hospital where he had an MRI scan and a biopsy. These tests showed that he has a grade four tumour . Jayden’s parents have also put out a ‘global appeal’ on Facebook for ‘energy and positive thoughts’. In just two weeks, it has been shared more than 12,000 times and messages of support have flooded in from around the world. The couple wrote: ‘On August 28 2013, our little boy fell resulting in a bump to his head, due to becoming unsteady on his feet.

A three-year-old was killed after his mother's boyfriend shot him apparently during a game that went badly wrong. Zachariah Grisham, of Michigan City, Indiana, is being held on preliminary charges of reckless homicide and neglect of a dependant after blasting Lance Wilson in the head. Police said Grisham, the live-in boyfriend of Lance's mother, was at home playing a shooting game with the youngster when he reached for his pistol. Grisham, who appeared in court to face charges yesterday, has said he didn't realise the weapon was loaded. LaPorte County Prosecutor Bob Szilagyi said Grisham and Lance often played a game where the boy would point his finger and say, 'bang bang'. Grisham would play along by pointing his actual gun at Lance and pulling the trigger. This time, however, there was a bullet loaded into the chamber. Police arrived at around 3.30pm on Sunday to find the boy dead inside the trailer where he lived with Grisham, his mother and at least one other child. He had suffered a single gunshot wound to the head. An account of the killing was given to officials by the boy's mother and Grisham, who is being held in La Porte County jail on a $100,000 bond.

A father-of-two with a rare cancer gene had his stomach removed despite being given the all-clear by doctors - and found he was in the early stages of the disease. Dan Taylor, 33, decided to have the procedure to make sure he would live to see his young daughters grow up. Doctors found he had the mutant E-cadherin gene which meant he had an 80 per chance of developing the aggressive stomach cancer that claimed the lives of two of his cousins. Dan Taylor (pictured with his wife, Anne) has a rare gene which meant he had an 80 per cent chance of developing stomach cancer. He had his stomach removed to ensure he would live to see his daughters grow up . They told Mr Taylor he had not yet developed the disease but he still underwent the major six-hour operation to remove his stomach. Medics then discovered he had been in the early stages of the disease after all and that the procedure had saved his life. Mr Taylor, of York, who inherited the gene from his father’s side of the family, said: ‘I have two adorable children and want to see them grow up. ‘The survival rates of stomach cancer are absolutely dire so it wasn’t a difficult decision to make. ‘To go ahead with an operation of that magnitude is a personal choice. One of the great things is the risk has gone and is never coming back. ‘I’m so glad I did it because I did have the early stages of stomach cancer. Mr Taylor (pictured with his wife, Anne, and daughters Abigail, five, and Edith, two) had tests which suggested that he did not have the cancer but he decided to have his stomach removed anyway . ‘I’d had an endoscopy and biopsies at the end of 2011 which came back clear for stomach cancer, but the risk was still there. ‘We were told endoscopies can be unreliable and biopsies can miss cancer by millimetres so I decided to take the drastic decision to have my stomach removed. ‘People say I’m really unlucky to have that gene but I feel incredibly fortunate I found out about it and had this treatment before I had to go through something much worse. After the operation, Mr Taylor discovered that he did actually have early stage stomach cancer so the surgery saved his life. He says he is relieved that the risk is gone . ‘Rather than a negative thing, I think it’s quite a positive.’ Mr Taylor and his wife Anne, who run a web design company, now face an anxious wait to see if their daughters Abigail, five, and Edith, two, have also inherited the cancer gene. The youngsters will have to wait until their early teens until they can be tested for the gene which they have a 50 per cent chance of carrying. Mr Taylor said: ‘We have the stress that one day our kids may go through something like this but that’s a long way off. Mr Taylor cannot store food now that he does not have a stomach so he has to eat a high-calorie diet and has lots of small meals every day . ‘The way medicine is progressing it could be something which is resolved without an operation.’ Mr Taylor made a speedy recovery after the operation and less than two weeks later was enjoying a couple of pints in his local. After six weeks he was back at work. The operation was possible as the stomach is mainly used for food storage and is not essential for digestion. As part of the procedure the bottom of Mr Taylor’s oesophagus was connected to the top of his intestines. Mr Taylor, who runs a web design company with his wife, says that he was amazed by how quickly he recovered after the operation . This has reduced his capacity for food and means he needs to eat little and often, with lots of high calorie meals. He said: ‘It’s not a different as you might think. I enjoy a diet most people would be jealous of and have a lot of biscuits and crisps at my desk. ‘I am always pretty optimistic but by my standards the recovery was quicker and easier than I thought and I feel better than I ever thought I would again.’ The E-cadherin gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps cells stick to one another. The proteins bind cells together so that they form organised tissues. The gene is also thought to act as a tumour suppressor, preventing cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way to form a cancerous tumour. Because this protein helps cells stick together, it may stop cancer cells detaching from a tumour and travelling through the bloodstream to other parts of the body. More than 50 mutations of the gene have been found in people with an inherited cancer syndrome called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. This disorder greatly increases the risk of a person developing cancer of the stomach lining. In these people, the cancer most commonly develops when they are in their 30s or 40s.","Dan Taylor, 33, had an 80% chance of developing stomach cancer .

"By . Charlotte Bradshaw . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 7 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:46 EST, 9 September 2013 . Treated well: Charlotte Bradshaw had micrographic surgery after he cancer diagnosis . There is an ever-widening variety of treatments for skin cancers – from lasers and light therapy, to creams, radiation and freezing. But one that is still proving most effective, according to experts, is also the most old-fashioned – and involves ‘mapping’ the tumours using a paper and pencil. The surgical technique, known as Mohs micrographic surgery, was first developed in the 1930s. I found out all about it when last year, a few months shy of my 40th birthday, I was diagnosed with a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) that developed in the centre of my forehead. I had a strange ‘ulcer’ that appeared from nowhere that would scab over but never fully heal. I . was worried about it, so sought the help of my GP. It took a while to get a proper diagnosis because I don’t fit the usual profiling. The risk of BCCs increases with age, and they most commonly affect those over the age of 60. I do however have risk factors – I have fair skin and have spent time abroad. A biopsy finally confirmed the result. After coming to terms with a cancer diagnosis, which did hit me hard though I was quickly reassured that it was not a life-threatening form, I started to research the best treatment options available. As well as wanting the cancer gone, in truth I was also concerned about the size of the scar I would be left with. Online, I discovered that during standard surgery, a 4mm margin is cut which would have left a significant mark on my face. It was during an appointment to discuss this with my GP that Mohs surgery was first mentioned. He had also recently been diagnosed with a BCC, which accounts for 75 per cent of all skin cancers. Mohs cures about 99 per cent of BCCs when treated for the first time. The success rate drops to about 95 per cent for previously treated BBCs that then return. And, according to consultant dermatological surgeon Dr Raj Mallipeddi, who heads up the country’s largest Mohs units at St Thomas’ Hospital in London: ‘In areas like the nose, ears and eyelids it will give a better cosmetic outcome.’ The Mohs procedure (it’s named after the surgeon who invented it, Frederic Mohs) begins with the removal of the visible portion of the skin cancer with a scalpel, along with a layer of surrounding skin. Once a layer of tissue has been removed, a map, or drawing, of it and its orientation to the face is made on paper to serve as a guide to the precise location of the tumour. The tissue is processed using stains to help highlight any cancerous material, which the surgeon will then examine under the microscope. If cancer is still present in certain areas, the surgeon will then remove another layer of tissue with a scalpel. The process is repeated until all cancer cells have been removed and only healthy cells remain. It is only then that the wound is closed. The procedure, is performed using only local anaesthetic, and can take up to six hours, although most of the time is spent waiting for results rather than being  operated on. Not all patients will automatically be put forward for this treatment. There are only a small number of units performing Mohs in the UK. St Thomas’, the largest provider, treated around 1,000 patients last year. There are about 113,000 new cases of skin cancer every year in the UK. The treatment is also suitable for another common type – squamous cell carcinoma, which accounts for 20 per cent of cases. Mohs can even treat certain forms of melanoma, the deadliest skin cancer. Depending on the diagnosis, the consultant may decide that a standard excision will have a higher chance of success  without the long operative time and cost  of Mohs. Other options include radiotherapy, the use of topical creams such as Imiquimod; or Photodynamic Therapy, which combines use of a special cream with exposure to a specific wavelength of light. However topical treatments are usually reserved for low-risk superficial tumours. High success rate: Using pencil and paper to map out the tumours has proven to be one of the most successful way to treating skin cancer . So what is it like? The operation day itself is a long one. During my first session, the surgeon removed the lesion and a layer of surrounding tissue, cauterised and bandaged the area while I returned to the waiting room. Once the anaesthetic was injected, the procedure was painless and relatively fast. I had about an hour’s wait, in which  I sat and read a magazine before being called back into theatre, where the surgeon explained there were two areas where cancer cells were still present. The most uncomfortable bit of the whole procedure was when the team cleaned  the wound and injected it again ready for more surgery. The area was again cauterised, burnt with a heated instrument to stem the bleeding, and covered in a large plaster packed with gauze and I returned for my final wait. After another hour passed flicking through magazines, I was called into  theatre by Dr Mallipeddi who said that as the margins were now clear the wound could be closed. It was an indescribable relief to hear that the cancer had gone. Then I had to get my brave face on for the final bit of surgery. More anaesthetic and a bit of tugging drew my skin together, and it took  about three weeks for the wound to heal properly. Four months on and the scar is about 3cm long. But people only notice it if I point it out. Make-up and a newly adopted fringe certainly help, but it is a small price to pay for a face free from cancer. If I have learned anything from the experience it is this: skip the sunbed, wear sunscreen at all times, wear a hat and cover your shoulders in the sun. And if you notice a patch of skin or an ulcer that doesn’t heal, report it to your GP. The sooner you catch a change, the better your chance of a full cure and  less scarring.","Charlotte Bradshaw was diagnosed with skin cancer at 39 .

Elderly residents at a care home were stuck in their rooms for months, starved and left in filthy sheets while their cries were ignored by staff who removed call buttons so they could sleep through shifts. Inspectors who visited the home in July were begged for water by residents, many of whom were suffering from Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. One told the inspectors that conditions were so bad he wanted to kill himself. Killed: May Ward was being moved from her chair to her bed by a sling and hoist when she fell to the floor, but instead of calling for help nurses but the bloodied pensioner back in bed . Three years ago another resident, 100-year-old May Ward, was accidentally dropped on her head by two carers who waited 40 minutes before calling for help. She died the next day. The horrific conditions have come to light after Care Quality Commission inspectors reported abuse they witnessed at the Meppershall Care Home near Shefford in Bedfordshire. The home closed last month after the inspection, but the company which ran it, GA Projects, maintains its residents were ‘happy’. It continues to manage two other homes for vulnerable elderly people. Inspectors found frail residents had been locked indoors for four months after a lift broke and was not repaired, leaving them distressed and isolated in their bedrooms. Inspectors found frail residents of Meppershall Nursing Home had been locked indoors for four months after a lift broke . They were starved and desperate for water but staff ignored their calls. Residents even had their call bells, used to alert staff in emergencies, removed from their rooms. A staff member told inspectors that carers slept on duty at night and removed the alarms so ‘they were not disturbed’. When inspectors entered the bedrooms they found residents in sheets ‘encrusted with faecal matter, dried urine, blood and dead skin’. The vulnerable pensioners were wearing soiled clothes and there was an ‘offensive’ odour throughout the home. One resident told inspectors they were ‘desperate’ for a drink and had called for a nurse, but nobody had come. When CQC officials asked a nurse to bring some water, the staff member twice ignored them. Asked if they were well cared for, the resident replied: ‘You must be joking.’ Care home of shame: Upon a visit, one elderly man told inspectors the conditions at Meppershall had made him suicidal . During one inspection, officials saw a care home worker pick up porridge from down the side of a chair, scrape it back into the bowl from which a resident was eating and wipe their fingers on it. Pies were served covered in mould to other residents suffering with dementia. The inspectors reported that staff lacked ‘compassion and the skills and competency required to deliver basic care safely to people’. They added: ‘People were left without food and fluids for long periods of time and their calls for help were frequently ignored by staff, leaving them in undignified and unsafe situations.’ Meppershall Care Home residents have since been moved to other homes. GA Projects also owns Wren Park Nursing Home in Bedfordshire and Tendring Meadows Residential Home in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex. A spokesman for the company said: ‘The situation at Meppershall Care Home has been grossly exaggerated to justify the authorities’ decision to enforce closure. The majority of residents were happy and the problems identified could have been resolved. ‘There was not a single resident who would have chosen to leave and many are still distressed by their relocation and sadly think they will return. Our other homes have received good inspection reports.’","Residents maltreated at Meppershall Care Home in Bedfordshire .

The Chillsner, developed by Orlando-based gadget company Corkcicle, looks like an icicle and sits inside the bottle in order to keep beer cold 'until the last sip'. Designed to fit any standard 9-inch long-neck bottle, the chiller contains a thermal gel which has to be frozen for at least 90 minutes before use. The Chillsner, developed by Orlando-based gadget company Corkcicle, is made from aluminium and looks like an icicle. It can be put inside drinks bottles to keep the beverages colder for longer. The Chillsner will be available from June and costs around £20. It will come with a freezer pack and two coasters . Festival-goers in South Africa this summer will be able to order beer from their smartphones and have it delivered by a flying drone dropping a can attached to a parachute. The drone has been developed by Darkwing Aerials and will be tested at the Oppikoppi music festival in the Limpopo province of South Africa this August. Customers will be able to place their drink orders through an iOS app that will send their GPS coordinates to the drone operators. The company claims it will then keep the drink cold 'until the last sip' - although the gadget is said to defrost fully within about 45 minutes. Once inserted, the Chillsner stays in the bottle, but does not prevent drinkers from taking a swig.

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 06:42 EST, 3 November 2011 . This is the shocking moment a trio are caught on camera viciously attacking a restaurant customer, while one of them swings wildly at the man with a machete. The group brutally attacked the lone victim inside U.S. Chicken in Paterson, New Jersey, as one of the men wielded the large blade and slashed at the helpless customer. At the end of the attack the three men flee from the restaurant, as the bloodied man lies sprawled across the restaurant. Scroll down to see the shocking attack . The barbaric attack starts when the victim scraps with bare-chested man thought to be Johel Gomez, 20, just inside the restaurant . Brutal: Seconds later Gomez is allegedly joined by machete-wielding Tyree Seegers and Omar Villota, who savagely attack the helpless customer . Wild: Seegers swings savagely at the man, who by now is off camera as the brutal assaults continues . And to complete the shocking attack, as the group leave one of the men lands a vicious kick on the victim's head. Police say the attack, as well as another assault carried out on a different customer minutes earlier, were both unprovoked. Officers believe Tyree Seegers, 22, hacked at the second man 14 times with a machete during the attack on September 10. His attack was so wild that at one point he chops into accomplice Omar Villota, 22, who is allegedly continually pistol-whipping the victim. Helpless: The customer is apparently beaten to the floor, while a man thought to be Seegers (in white) continues to slash wildly at him with a machete in his right hand . The beating eventually comes to an end when the two men leave, but not before Gomez allegedly delivers a brutal kick to his head as he lies prone on the floor . It is thought Seegers almost accidentally severed Villota's right arm while savagely slashing at the intended victim. The third man, Johel Gomez, 20, is allegedly seen on the video repeatedly punching the customer. Officers eventually tracked down the three men by following the blood trail left by Villota. Gomez, Seegers and Villota have all been arrested. Seegers was picked up early on Wednesday morning after turning himself in. Police last week revealed they have arrested Tyree Seegers, Omar Villota, Johel Gomez in connection with the machete attack . Caught: The trio were eventually tracked down from blood trails when they left the U.S. Chicken restaurant in Paterson, New Jersey . Amazingly, despite being subjected to the vicious assault, the victim was not seriously hurt, according to police. Paterson Police Capt. Heriberto Rodriguez, said: 'He’s doing alright. He was banged up... nothing life threatening, thank God.' Police say the only reason the customer avoided more serious injury was because Seegers was so wayward with the machete. Rodriguez added: 'The one time he swung it straight and effectively, he hit his own counterpart, his owns friend.' Police are still seeking the first victim and want him to come forward.","Attacker 'slashed at victim 14 times with machete' in chicken restaurant .

Gonorrhea has been classified as an urgent public-health threats in the United States after it has grown drug-resistant . Gonorrhoea has been classified as an urgent public-health threat in the United States after it has grown drug-resistant. At least 2 million people in the United States develop serious bacterial infections that are resistant to one or more types of antibiotics each year, and at least 23,000 die from the infections, according to a new report. They also include diaorrhea-causing superbug C difficile and a fast-growing killer 'nightmare' bacteria dubbed a known as CRE. It comes as experts warn we are fast approaching a 'post anti-biotic era' where the 'cushion of drugs' to protect us against diseases is gone. Overprescribing of antibiotics has been held to blame for the increase in drug resistance. Experts say it allows pathogens the opportunity to outwit the drugs used to treat them. And only a . handful of new antibiotics have been developed and brought to market in . the past few decades, with only a few companies working on drugs to . replace them. Dr Thomas Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which released the report, said: 'For organism after organism, we're seeing this steady increase in resistance rates. 'We don't have new drugs about to come out of the pipeline. If and when we get new drugs, unless we do a better job of protecting them, we'll lose those, also.' Steve Solomon, acting director for the epidemiology and analysis program office at the CDC told Bloomberg that bacterial resistance was identified shortly after antibiotics were first used in the 1940s, but that there had always been new drugs in the pipeline. But he said: 'The cushion of new antibiotics is gone. 'We’re right at the edge of this cliff where we’re approaching the post-antibiotic era.”' The first of its kind report was conceived to bring together as much information as possible about drug-resistant superbugs and how to slow their spread, with a hope of preserving the remaining drugs that still work, Frieden said. Drug-resistant . Neisseria gonorrhoeae, causes 246,000 U.S. cases of the sexually . transmitted disease gonorrhoea each year. The disease is increasingly . becoming resistant to tetracycline, cefixime, ceftriaxone and . azithromycin - formerly the most successful treatments for the disease. Gonorrohea . is especially troublesome because it is easily spread, and infections . are easily missed. In the United States, there are approximately 300,000 . reported cases, but because infected people often have no symptoms the . CDC estimates the actual number of cases is closer to 820,000. If . left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, . ectopic pregnancy, stillbirths, severe eye infections in babies and . infertility in men and women. 'The three organisms that have been . chosen as urgent are all increasing at an alarming rate to which . therapies are limited,'  said Dr Edward Septimus, an infectious disease . expert at HCA Healthcare System in Houston, Texas, and a member of the . Infectious Diseases Society of America's Antimicrobial Resistance . Workgroup. Septimus, who was not involved with the CDC report, . said the pathogens in the urgent and serious categories - which include . Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, and drug-resistant . tuberculosis - are 'certainly worthy of immediate response. I do . believe it's a looming public-health crisis,'  he said. The United States is not alone in raising the alarm over antibiotic drug resistance. Last March England's chief medical officer for England said antibiotic resistance poses a 'catastrophic health threat'. They also include diaorrhea-causing superbug C difficile (pictured) and a fast-growing killer 'nightmare' bacteria dubbed a known as CRE . That followed a report last year from the World Health Organization that found a 'superbug' strain of gonorrhea had spread to several European countries. The CDC report ranks the threat of drug-resistant superbugs into three categories - urgent, severe and concerning - based on factors such as their health and economic impacts, the total number of cases, the ease with which they are transmitted and the availability of effective antibiotics. Among the top three threats deemed 'urgent' is CRE, which Frieden last March called a 'nightmare bacteria' because even the strongest antibiotics are not effective against it. According to the report, CRE accounts for 9,300 healthcare-associated infections. The two most common types of CRE - carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella spp. and carbapenem-resistant E. coli - account for some 600 deaths each year. 'For CRE, we're seeing increases from 1 state to 38 states in the last decade,' Frieden said. And according to the report, C. difficile causes 250,000 infections and kills 14,000 people in the United States each year, adding $1 billion annually in excess medical costs. Deaths from C. difficile rose 400 percent from 2000 to 2007 due to the emergence of a drug-resistant strain of the bacteria.","Experts have warned antibiotics are becoming useless against diseases .

As Netflix continues to expand its market across the globe it has started looking to pirate websites to find out which shows are popular before the company buys them. Just this week the video streaming giant rolled out its services to the Netherlands where it hopes to build a large user base. Netflix Vice President of Content Acquisition, Kelly Merryman, says that their new presence in Europe is partly based on what shows do well on BitTorrent networks and other pirate sites. Unobtainable: Netflix has not been able to buy TV show, Game of Thrones, from HBO . Inspiration: Vice President of Content Acquisition, Kelly Merryman, says Netflix looks at pirate websites to see what is popular . ‘With the purchase of series, we look at what does well on piracy sites, Merryman says, according to TorrentFreak. One of the shows that Netflix acquired the rights to in the Netherlands is Prison Break, since it is heavily pirated locally. ‘Prison Break is exceptionally popular on piracy sites,’ Merryman says. The show, starring actor Wentworth Miller, was broadcast on Fox for four seasons, from 2005 until 2009. Prison Break: Netflix says the TV show, starring actor Wentworth Miller, is 'exceptionally popular on piracy sites' Popular: The Dutch are loving the TV show, Prison Break, says Netflix's Vice President of Content, Kelly Merryman . According to Netflix CEO, Reed Hastings, people who download content without permission via torrent sites is not necessarily a bad thing, as it also creates demand for the content Netflix is offering. Eventually these BitTorrent users may want to switch to Netflix as it’s a much better user experience than torrenting, according to the CEO. Through Netflix, consumers can still get cheap unlimited entertainment online, without the fear of being sued for illegally downloading music and movies. ‘Netflix is so much easier than torrenting. You don’t have to deal with files, you don’t have to download them and move them around. You just click and watch,’ Hastings says. A matter of time: Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix, says people who use pirate sites will eventually turn to Netflix . One goal of Netflix is to convert people who currently use pirate sites to get their fix, and there is some evidence that this is indeed happening. According to Hastings, there is evidence that BitTorrent traffic in Canada dropped 50 per cent after Netflix started there three years ago. The real challenge for the streaming service is to license as much content as they can, which is easier said than done. It might not be a coincidence that Game of Thrones is the most pirated TV show, according to TorrentFreak. Most popular: Game of Thrones is the 'most pirated TV show' Price they could refuse: Netflix was not able to buy Game of Thrones from HBO, no matter what they offered . After all, Netflix wasn’t able to buy the rights from HBO no matter what they offered. Premium cable channels are withholding their most popular series, including Game of Thrones and Dexter, because they are worried about losing subscribers if the content is available on Netflix's less expensive Internet service. Time Warner's Jeff Bewkes told The Verge that piracy was 'a tremendous word-of-mouth thing' as well. 'If you go around the world, I think you're right, that Game of Thrones is the most pirated show in the world,' he said. 'Now that's better than an Emmy.'","The internet video streaming provider says illegal downloading sites show what series are the most popular .

A woman has told jurors in Albuquerque how she heard gunshots and then realised that the Oklahoma couple she and two escaped Arizona inmates had carjacked less than two hours earlier were dead. Called to the witness stand in the capital murder trial of her cousin and boyfriend, John McCluskey, 48, Casslyn Welch, 47, said she then saw him come out of the trailer with blood on his clothes and shoes. He is facing federal carjacking and murder charges in the August 2010 shooting deaths of Gary and Linda Haas of Tecumseh, Okla., and if convicted he could face life in prison or the death penalty. Casslyn Welch, left, said she saw her lover John McCluskey with blood 'all over him' after she heard gunshots . The Haases' bodies were found incinerated in their burned-out travel trailer on a remote ranch in eastern New Mexico. The killings happened three days after Welch said she helped McCluskey and two other inmates escape from a privately-run, medium security prison near Kingman. One of the inmates was caught a day later in Colorado, but Welch, McCluskey and his former prison bunkmate Tracy Province sparked a nationwide manhunt. Their photographs were being flashed on the television news, the court heard. 'The stress level was absolutely beyond max,' Welch testified. She told jurors she and the fugitives decided to commandeer a truck and travel trailer so they could 'get off the grid' and go into hiding. Childhood sweethearts Gary and Linda Haas, both 61, were going camping when they were carjacked and shot . They spotted the Haases, a retired couple who had just stopped for lunch at a rest-stop near the Texas-New Mexico state line, on 2 August 2010. At gunpoint, the couple was forced to drive west until being ordered off Interstate 40 and onto to a lonely two-lane road. The truck and trailer stopped after turning around. Welch said she and Province were outside the trailer when the gunshots rang out. Prosecutors and testimony over the last three weeks of trial point to McCluskey being the triggerman. 'He had a lot of blood on him - his pants, his shoes, his shirt,' Welch testified. Casslyn Welch shortly after she and her lover McCluskey were arrested by a SWAT team in Arizona in 2010 . When asked if she looked inside the trailer, Welch said: 'Just couldn't do it.' She said she didn't need to, knowing the Haases were shot at close range and with a high-caliber pistol. Welch, who pleaded guilty last year to charges related to the 2010 killings and now faces life in jail, is expected to take the stand again today when the trial resumes. Jurors yesterday heard a series of recorded phone conversations between McCluskey and Welch in which the two spoke in code while planning the prison break. The calls often ended with the two declaring their love for one another. While the pair would refer to each other as husband and wife, they were not legally married. In one of the calls, McCluskey tells Welch she needs to do a better job of following instructions. 'If you don't, it's going to be a disaster,' he said. 'I don't think you understand the severity of it.' Welch answered: 'Yes I do. I can get killed. You can get killed.'","Casslyn Welch, 46, testified in John McCluskey's Albuquerque murder trial .

Another suit by local politicians like Republican State Representative Steve Drazkowski claims the public employees are accessing their info to dig up dirt on political foes . The suit states that in 2008, Miles received word that her driver's license info had been accessed. When she called the Driver and Vehicle Services department, a director Patricia McCormack assured her it was a one time breach by a 'curious' employee who had since been punished. But a week later, someone entered an area bank and was able to swap out Miles' bank card and gain access to her account by using her name. 'McCormack fraudulently concealed from Jessica the massive extent' of the data breach, according to the suit. Miles has declined to comment on the case through her attorney. In a statement, the DPS director of communications Bruce Gordon wrote: 'We can’t comment on pending litigation, and we have yet to see the lawsuit.' Last week, a state politician made headlines when he filed suit, along with 18 others, against Wabasha County police and other officials. The Pioneer Press reports that Rep. Steve Drazkowski and the other plaintiffs, all of them politically active, allege the groups accessed their data in order to dig up dirt.

On November 8, 1985, Tom Odle, 18, brutally murdered his parents and three siblings in an LSD-fueled rage in the small Illinois town of Mount Vernon. The mass murder shocked the nation, and Odle was sentenced to death by lethal injection. However, in 2003 his sentence was commuted to life in prison, prompting Odle to reach out to a neuroscientist to try and understand what had driven him to commit the horrific act. Odle teamed up with Dr. Robert Hanlon, a neuropsychologist from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who had examined him in the past. Convicted killer: Tom Odle, 47 (pictured in recent mugshot), is serving a life sentence for the 1985 murders of his parents and three younger siblings after his death sentence was commuted in 2003 . Their collaboration has resulted in the non-fiction book Survived by One: The Life and Mind of a Family Mass Murderer, which was published last month. According to Hanlon, the 47-year-old Odle, who is currently serving a life sentence at the Dixon Correction Center after spending 17 years on death row, is filled with 'extreme regret and guilt' over his crime. ‘Beyond that, he feels shame not only for what he did with is life and the murders of his family, but how it affected his community and other relatives, friends of the family and teachers,’ he told ABC News. ‘Everyone knew his family and the monumental crime.’ The book, for which Odle received no monetary compensation, is based on his letters to Hanlon and their therapy sessions, in which the inmate recalled suffering years of abuse at the hands of his 'sadistic' mother. According to Hanlon, Odle was driven by revenge when he went on a rampage in 1985. During the process of self-reflection and analysis, Mr Odle has revealed that his mother was physically and emotionally abusive, mostly tormenting him and his brother Sean, while their father idly stood by and did nothing to defend them. Gruesome murder: Tom Odle (bottom left) stabbed to death his mother Carolyn and father Robert (bottom center and right), and also murdered his two younger brothers and sister (top row) Diagram of death: When Robert Odle failed to show up for work, police came to the house and discovered the bodies in a bedroom and bathroom . A look back: Jailer Scott Scherer escorts Thomas Odle, 19, of Mt. Vernon on May 13, 1986 to jail from the Richland County Courthouse , where he is on trial for murder . Tom Odle's sibling was at one time removed from the home after he told school officials that he was often denied food and chained to his bed while his mother went out. Odle grew up to be a troubled teen, turning to drugs and petty theft. By 1985, his parents wanted him out of the house. On November 8, the 18-year-old was supposed to move out of his family's Mount Vernon home. Instead, Tom Odle took LSD and stabbed his 39-year-old father Robert to death with a butcher knife.  He then waited for his mother, Carolyn, to return home. As she entered the house, the son attacked her with a knife, stabbing her in the neck to death. Collaboration: Tom Odle teamed up with neuropsychologist Robert Hanlon to write a book about his case titled Survived by One: The Life and Mind of a Family Mass Murderer, which was published last month . Odle concluded the bloody rampage by murdering his 14-year-old sister, Robyn, and his 13-year-old brother Sean, and strangling to death Scott, 10. Dr Hanlon explained that Tom Odle exterminated his innocent siblings because he was in 'a homicidal state of mind' after killing his parents, comparing it to an out-of-control freight train. Unlike many other mass murderers, Odle was not suffering from a major mental illness, and according to Hanlon, he could appreciate that was he was doing was both morally wrong and criminal in nature. Police discovered the slain family when Robert Odle failed to show up for work that day. Tom was quickly tracked down to a nearby motel and arrested. The teen never denied killing his family. On May 29, 1986, a jury panel deliberated less than two hours before finding Odle guilty of five counts of murder. His court-appointed lawyer James Henson said during his closing arguments that his client was 'feeling sick and nauseated' as he was killing his family, but he could not stop. 'Something took hold of him,' he told the court. 'Something made him do it.' Henson cited testimony from psychologists and psychiatrists that Odle was a victim of years of abuse by a sadistic mother in a family setting where violence was the norm. 'His being forced to leave (home) was the ultimate rejection, the ultimate abuse and what pushed him over the edge,' Henson said. Expert opinion: Dr. Robert Hanlon, a neuropsychologist from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said that therapy sessions with Odle have revealed the inmate was filled with remorse and guilt . Odle was sentenced to death, but in 2000 then-Illinois Governor George Ryan imposed a moratorium on the death penalty. Three years later, Odle's death sentence was changed to natural life. According to Dr Hanlon, until that point the death row inmate was living in denial and repressing the memories of his crime because he believed that he was soon going to be executed. But following the commutation of his death sentence, Odle was faced with a future, which prompted him to contact Hanlon in order to understand what had driven him to murder his family in the hope of preventing other such tragedies.","Tom Odle, 47, was convicted of killing his parents, 14-year-old sister and two brothers, ages 13 and 10, in 1985 .

An executive for the largest sporting events security firm in the US has been outed as a vicious racist. Contemporary Services Corp’s Scott Dennison, 56, a vice president for special events, routinely sent hate-filled, profane emails calling African Americans everything from ‘scum suckers’ and ‘worthless,’ to n—-s. Easily recognizable to people regularly attending American sporting events or concerts with their yellow ‘CSC EVENT STAFF’ shirts or jackets, the company’s security guards are ubiquitous with major events across the US. Everywhere: CSC EVENT STAFF shirts and jackets are ubiquitous with US sports stadiums . ‘No African Americans please only limited quantities that have brains and can actually do a day’s work,’ Mr Dennison wrote Oct 1, 2009 in an email revealed by the New York Post. The email, according to the paper, was discussing recruits for the following year’s US Open tennis tournament – which holds its final in Arthur Ashe Stadium, named for the famed African-American tennis great. Not content to just insult blacks’ work ethic and intelligence, Mr Dennison took it a step further in a July 14, 2011 email discussing a trainer scouting for new security dogs. Vile: Scott Dennison's racist emails insulted African-Americans while recruiting staff for the US Open, which plays its finals in a stadium named after famed black tennis great Arthur Ashe . ‘If he likes what he sees he will fly the Dog to Denver. There he will do a great deal of bite work, off leash training and some n—-r eating exercises,’ Mr Dennison wrote, according to the Post. Mr Dennison also included a former black employee in mocking President Obama and the activist Rev. Al Sharpton in a July 22, 2010 email – this one supposedly hashing out details for a Craigslist post seeking security guards for that year’s US Open. Champion: Serena Williams has won the last two US Open tournaments, and five overall - her sister Venus Williams also won twice . ‘Yu sez brothurz, Mr. Gon allows the black man to be superior we run the place cuz we needs the money and Obama and Rev Sharpton allowed us to mix with the White Crackers at this event,’ Mr Dennison wrote, according to the Post. ‘Come on down we can cheat, steal, eat food and sleep. Just like our new govt allows us to do, to get back at the white man for Slavery,’ he continued. That employee, Sean Felder, 45 from Harlem, is suing CSC for discrimination and retaliation. The 2010 lawsuit was filed in federal court, records showed. Mr Felder did not return a message left by MailOnline seeking comment. Suing: Sean Felder, of Harlem, NY., is suing CSC for discrimination and retaliation . ‘The first thing I thought was: How stupid do you have to be to put this in writing?’ John Storer, the former CSC employee on the receiving end of Mr Dennison’s vile rants asked the paper. Mr Storer, 47, worked with CSC from 2009 to 2012. Mr Dennison could not immediately be reached for comment by MailOnline. There was no answer at CSC's New York office when called Tuesday during business hours. As VP in charge of special events, Mr Dennison also handles the AT&T Pebble Beach National-Pro-Am golf tournament and Barrett-Jackson Auction car shows, the Post reported.

A man who drove from Missouri to Maine in a car packed with weapons while on the hunt for his ex-wife has been convicted of interstate stalking. Stalker: Benjamin Lee, 52, was convicted Monday of driving 1,500 miles to stalk ex-wife Tawny Lee and her boyfriend . In Sept 2012 in a borrowed car filled with three loaded guns, two unloaded rifles, a bayonet, a machete, a folding knife, handcuffs, plastic sheeting, latex gloves and camouflage face paint, Benjamin Lee drove from Springfield, MO., to Limerick, ME., and drove back and forth in front of her house. The disturbed man was arrested a short distance from the home, charged with interstate stalking and convicted Monday after a five day trial, according to reports. Convicted by a jury of six men and six women in US District Court in Portland, Mr Lee, 52, faces up to five years in prison for his chilling 1,500 mile ride. Tawny Lee was notified by Stella Lee, one of Mr Lee’s sisters, that he had disappeared from Missouri and could be on his way to Maine to harm her, according to testimony. ‘Once he was well enough, he borrowed a car that Tawny would not recognize, that she would not be looking for,’ Assistant U.S. Attorney Darcie McElwee, said in her closing argument. The last two updates made April 26 to Mr Lee's Facebook page read only 'tawny lee.' Terrified: Ms Lee and now-husband Tim Mann called 911 while Mr Lee tormented them by pacing back and forth in front of their home in a white Cadillac . The horrified couple noticed a white . Cadillac pacing back and forth on their street soon after and . immediately called 911, they testified in court. Mr Lee chose to remain in custody until last week’s trial, according to reports. Prosecutors detailed to the jury repeated death threats made by Mr Lee to ex-wife Tawny Lee and then-boyfriend Timothy Mann in the immediate aftermath of her leaving him in April 2012, reports said. Ms Lee walked out on her ailing husband only one month after his accident – for a high school boyfriend, according to testimony cited by the Kennebec Journal, but those death threats were blamed  by the defense on Mr Lee’s altered mental state during his recovery. Horrifying: Mr Lee packed a machete similar to this one - as well as handcuffs, plastic sheeting and latex gloves - into the borrowed Cadillac . ‘The emails sent before that made no sense and were a product of Mr. Lee's extremely poor health,’ defense lawyer James Clifford argued. Witnesses testifying for the defense countered the troubled Mr Lee made those threats while under the influence of strong pain killers while undergoing several surgeries to repair his broken back after a car accident, according to the Journal. The accident was in March 2012. Also blamed for his erratic behavior by his defense were diabetes and a heart condition, the Journal noted. Explaining that the altered mental state was the result of ‘extremely low blood sugar,’ Dr Christine Irish said that ‘his diabetes was being poorly controlled during this time.’ The sickly Lee even went into diabetic shock May 20, 2012, causing him to lose consciousness, according to sister Linda Watson. ‘I didn’t think he would live,’ Ms Watson testified. Threatening: Mr Lee had a bayonet similar to this one packed into his car . Mr Clifford also argued that Mr Lee drove away under his own free will and was arrested five miles from the home, reported the Portland Press Herald. ‘Are we to believe that he drove 1,500 miles simply to drive by the house?’ Ms McElwee asked during her rebuttal to the defense's closing arguments cited by the Press Herald. ‘You can infer from other circumstances in the case that he intended to return to the home at a later point in time.’ The jury appears to have taken Ms McElwee’s advice, their conviction carries up to a five year sentence in federal prison. Tawny Lee married Tim Mann in the time between their terrified 911 call and the trial. Mr Lee has 14 days to appeal.","Benjamin Lee, 52, faces up to five years in prison for the 1,500 mile drive in a car filled with weapons .

Eileen Rockefeller sheds light on what it was like growing up in one of America's wealthiest and most powerful families, in her new memoir Being a Rockefeller, Becoming Myself. The youngest of David and Margaret Rockefeller’s six children, and great-granddaughter of oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, now aged 61, pushes the message that money doesn't buy happiness. She reveals that her during her childhood her mother battled severe depression, her billionaire father spent more time in the boardroom than at home and she struggled to find a sense of self-worth beyond her iconic family name. Revealing read: Eileen Rockefeller sheds light on what it was like growing up in one of America's wealthiest and most powerful families, in a new tell-all memoir, Being a Rockefeller, Becoming Myself . She told CBS: 'There is no question . that the privileges have way outweighed the responsibilities, the . difficulties. But where I think I feel common ground with everybody . watching is that we all suffer from something growing up. 'It . doesn't matter if we have money or don't have money; we suffer in our . own ways. And the net worth of our bank account is not nearly so . important, ultimately, as the self-worth.' Eileen, who split her time between lavish mansions in Manhattan, St Barts, Maine and New Jersey as a child, now lives a more rustic life on an organic farm in Vermont, with her businessman husband Paul Growald. 'It doesn't matter if we have money or don't have money; we suffer in our own ways' She told The Daily Beast that it was only until recently that she found a sense of identity. Her journey of self-discovery involved years of therapy and she gained further emotional support from her network of 22 cousins, many of whom have changed their names to avoid scrutiny. In the first chapter of her book titled, The Story I Didn’t Want to Tell, Eileen touches on how she constantly felt 'subsumed by the enormity of accomplishment' that had gone before her. Detached parenting: Eileen says that her billionaire father David Sr spent more time in the boardroom than at home when she was growing up . Indeed, her industrialist grandfather . founded the Standard Oil Company with his brother in 1870, which helped . him to amass a net worth of $340billion. Meanwhile her father David Sr, who celebrated his 98th birthday this June, made a name for himself as a leading New York banker, serving as CEO and chairman for Chase Bank. 'In high school where I attempted to write about my family I would just feel overwhelmed by how much had been accomplished' 'Every time in any high school paper, college paper, where I had attempted to write anything about my family I would just feel overwhelmed by how much had been accomplished and no matter what I did I would feel so small,' Eileen told The Daily Beast. In his memoir released in 2003, David Sr touched on how his late wife of 55 years suffered from bouts of acute depression. And in her account, Eileen reveals how her mother's unpredictable behavior impacted on her most formative years. Fond memories: Eileen would frequently visit Kykuit growing up, a 40-room National Trust house in Westchester County, New York, built by her oil tycoon great-grandfather, John D. Rockefeller . 'She was all sunshine. But when she got in her dark moods, she was very much removed, and could be angry,' she explained. But with her father focused on his finance career and her five 'highly competitive' older siblings - David Jr, Abigail. Neva, Peggy and Richard - ignoring her, Eileen said she had nowhere to turn. 'For two years I felt like an only child because I was really the only one at home. I certainly didn’t feel I belonged.' she recalled. 'Our name has extraordinary convening power. I could call up anybody and get a meeting' However, over the years she says she managed to find ways of bonding with her family. 'I say in the book, I taught [my parents] to hug at a time when hugging wasn’t yet fashionable.' Away from the boardroom she said that her father had a great love of the outdoors and a bizarre passion for collecting beetles. His collection includes 150,000 different specimens. Other favorite hobbies to this day include horse and carriage driving, sailing, art collecting and traveling. Eileen, who has two grown sons, is the first woman in her family to write a memoir about her world famous clan. Writing debut: Eileen's candid memoir took her six years to complete and features a picture of her father on the cover . It took her six years to complete and . features a picture of her father on the cover. Before going to print, all . of the people mentioned were given a copy to vet. 'There will be no surprises,' she said, adding that it’s probably a ‘more public [discourse] than some of them would choose.’ Writing aside, Eileen spends much of her time on philanthropy; one of her current causes is fighting global warming. Her key messages for the next generation, adopted from her husband, are to travel, 'because it will give you perspective', and to realize the importance of education. Today she says the fifth and sixth generations of the Rockefeller family are more weighted towards business, because the 'money can only spread so far' and private funds have become 'disbursed'. While she says that being a Rockefeller has been somewhat of a curse, she admits there are plus points and she decided to keep her name for many reasons. She concluded: 'It will get you through the door [and] has extraordinary convening power.

Jury selection began Tuesday in the murder trial of a Florida woman who appeared on several national television programs as a teen because of her out-of-control hiccuping. Judge Nancy Moate Ley told potential jurors in a Pinellas County courtroom that the trial of 22-year-old Jennifer Mee would probably wrap up by the end of the week. Miss Mee is one of three people accused in the 2010 killing of Walmart employee Shannon Griffin Jr during a burglary gone awry in St. Petersburg. Scroll down for videos . Back in court: Jennifer Mee holds her head after she looked at family members, as jury selection begins her murder trial Tuesday . Defense: Mee talks with her attorney Bryant Camareno at the Pinellas County Justice Center in Clearwater, Fla. Bleak prospects: Mee, 22, faces a life in prison if convicted in the 2010 murder of a Walmart employee . Relapse: Mee's lawyer said she has experienced periodic bouts of hiccups while in jail, and she is being treated with a drug called thorazine . Judge Moate Ley said in court Tuesday . that the prosecution and defense will have to choose a dozen jurors from . a pool of about 70, The Tampa Tribune reported. Two prospective members of the panel were excused . after explaining that they would not be able to be impartial. Two . other would-be jurors were also dismissed: one of them because Judge . Moate Ley had presided over her husband's divorce case, and the other . because she had to take care of her ailing mother. The . case has attracted widespread attention because Mee had gained . notoriety in 2007 when she had a case of hiccups that wouldn't stop. Videos . of her hiccuping up to 50 times a minute gained her national attention, . as did her attempts to quell the problem. She tried home remedies and . consulted medical specialists, a hypnotist and an acupuncturist, until . the hiccups finally stopped on their own. Media blitz: Mee and her attorney (right) were able to convince the judge last week to allow the 22-year-old to sit down for interviews with several media outlets before her trial began . Just over two weeks ago, Mee's . co-defendant Laron Raiford, 23, was sentenced to life in prison after . being convicted of first-degree murder. Mr Raiford was the first of the three suspects to go to trial. If convicted of murder, Mee could face a life sentence. At . issue is whether Mee was a bystander or the person who planned the . robbery — prosecutors say she played an active role in planning the . robbery, which lead to Griffin's death. Under . Florida law, a person can be convicted of murder if he or she committed . a serious felony crime — such as robbery — and someone was killed as a . result. John Trevena, . Mee's attorney, said his client suffered from Tourette's Syndrome, a . neurological disorder that can cause involuntary movements and speech . problems. He said that the hiccups were one symptom of Tourette's and said Tuesday that he will mention that during the trial. ‘It . won't be used as a direct cause for what occurred but it might help . explain her errors in judgment and her often thoughtless response to law . enforcement,’ said Trevena, who said that Mee did not participate in . the robbery. Charged: Jennifer Mee, 22, is accused of luring Shannon Griffin (right)into a robbery in 2010, which ended in him being shot dead . Co-defendnats: Mee's then-boyfriend Lamont Newton, right, is still awaiting trial, while his friend Laron Raiford, left, was sentenced to life in prison August 30 . He added that his client has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and that he plans to explain that to the jury as well. Trevena said Mee has been in jail pending trial since her October 2010 arrest — much of that time in isolation because detention deputies say she is a high profile inmate. Mee has experienced periodic bouts of hiccups while in jail, said Trevena, and she is being treated with a drug called thorazine. ‘It controls the hiccups,’ he said. During a tearful prison interview on . the Today show in 2011, then-19-year-old Mee blamed her short-lived fame . for taking her down 'the path of the devil' and drawing her into bad . company. In the spotlight: Jennifer Mee first appeared on television as 'hiccup girl' when she was 15 (left), and she was even invited on the Today show (right) When . Mee was 15 years old, she became known as 'hiccup girl' when she began . hiccuping 50 times a minute. Her condition left doctors baffled and . earned her international publicity. Three . years later, she appeared in the news again - this time charged with . first-degree felony murder after police claimed she acted as bait to . lure Shannon Griffin, 22, into a robbery. Mee . is not accused of firing the gun, but under Florida law a defendant can . be charged with murder if they willingly take part in a felony which . then leads to someone's death. She has been held in Pinellas County jail ever since she was charged. Talking from the prison, she told NBC's Amy Robach in 2011 she cannot bear to . think about the possibility she could spend the rest of her life behind . bars. Fifteen minutes of fame: Mee had gained notoriety in 2007 when she had a case of hiccups that wouldn't stop . Downward spiral: Mee is accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old victim to an empty house where he was robbed and killed . She said: 'I’m scared. I want to go home; I can tell you that. My . sisters are growing up, my mom is missing me. The teenager said at the time she thinks about Mr Griffin's death every day. Prosecutors claim Mee plotted with her boyfriend, . Lamont Newton, and his friend, Laron Raiford, to rob Mr Griffin. Newton is still awaiting trial for first degree murder. She is . accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old on October 23, 2010, to . a dark alley in St Petersburg, where the two men robbed then shot him, getting away with $50. Initially Mee told police the shooting happened because Raiford found out Mr Griffin had been romantically involved with his girlfriend in the past. But later she changed her story and allegedly confessed she lured Mr Griffin to his death. Defense strategy: Mee's lawyer said his client had suffered from Tourette's syndrome and didn't know what she was doing . Blame game: Mee contented that her short-lived fame led her astray and drew her into bad company . Mee left home at 17, two years after she became known as 'hiccup . girl'. She claims her short-lived celebrity 'went to her head' and made . her go off the rails. Months of incessant hiccups left her temporarily unable to attend school as she disrupted other students. She tried home remedies and consulted medical specialists, a hypnotist, a . chiropractor, and an acupuncturist, until the hiccups finally just . stopped on their own a few weeks later. Her lawyer, Trevena, said her hiccups stemmed from her Tourette's syndrome, a neurological disorder whichcan cause involuntary movements and speech problems. He said: 'If you really believe her story, she’s really not guilty of anything except poor judgement of who she associated with.'","Jennifer Mee, 22, is charged with murder in the 2010 killing of Shannon Griffin .

Ordinary low denomination bills are raking in thousands of dollars in an online trend that is centred on the eight-digit serial number which appears on each U.S. banknote. 'Unusual' bills are being bought, sold and hunted on the website CoolSerialNumbers.com,  with low serial numbers, from 00000001 to 00000100, being particularly sought after, a $1 bill with the serial number 00000002 going for $2,500. Mark up: A $1 bill with the serial number F00000001 C would be worth thousands of dollars . The U.S.-based site lists all the different notes that collectors are looking out for and allows serial number fans to get in touch with one another. There are categories such as 'solids' (where the digits repeat eight times), 'ladders' (12345678), 'radars' (01133110 - where the number reads the same left-to-right as right-to-left) and 'repeaters' (20012001 - the second half is the same as the first half). Then there are 'radar repeaters' (12211221), 'super radars' (20000002 - all the internal digits are the same) and 'super repeaters' (where the first two digits are repeated four times, such as 63636363). Big bucks: It may not be worth $99,999,999 dollars - but the serial number means this note is likely to go for a bit more than $5 . Prize money: 'Repeaters' and 'super repeaters are also highly regarded on the website CoolSerialNumbers.com . High stakes: If 'trailing nine' of 19999999 is worth $750 on the website, imagine what this prize specimen must have gone for . Dave Undis, the a Nashville musician and currency collector who runs the site, is happy to include some criteria that might go unnoticed to the untrained eye - such as a 'pi note' with the number 31415927. A $5 bill with the number 33333333 is currently up for sale for $13,000, while a set of nine $20 bills running from 00000010 through to 00000090 can be bought for $1,800. A Google+ link on the site allows you to scroll through a full catalogue of unusual serial numbers. The site gets about 5,000 visitors a year, according to Undis, who says he has been collecting currency with 'cool serial numbers' for about 30 years. The U.S. Government introduced numbers onto banknotes in 1928, and has always used eight digits. $1 E 99999995 A                                   $1,500 . $1 B 00000002 J                                   $2,500 . $1 P 00000004 E                                   $1,250 . $1 B 00000004 J                                   $1,000 . $1 S 00000003 D                                   $1,000 .

In 2009, a batch of 20p pieces that had been minted without the date mark were valued at £50 - with one eBay seller appearing to make £7,100 from the sale of just one coin.

But when 70-year-old player Neal Manning called a batsman on his team ‘not out’, the game turned hostile. After his team went onto win the game, he claims players from the other team, the Stradbroke Vikings, attacked him in the car park. He was confronted by players from the losing team, who accused him of cheating for his side. Following a heated exchange he turned to leave but was pushed over from behind. He fell to the floor and was left with grazes to his arm, leg and shoulder. Mr Manning, who has been playing for 50 years, said he was shocked by the reaction in the league ‘for players who’ve seen better days’. The incident on Saturday is now being investigated by local league officials in Suffolk and Essex. The dispute came after Mr Manning, who . was playing as a lower order batsman for Ipswich, took his turn as . umpire, as is normal in local cricket matches.

Mr Manning, a retired sports journalist of Kesgrave, Suffolk, said there was animosity after the game as his own side refused to have a customary drink with their hosts. He said: ‘This has never happened to me before and I’m saddened that this is what cricket’s coming to. Things are said on the field, but once you get to the bar everything is usually forgotten about. ‘I got off lightly, I could have got a head injury.

A spokesman for the league said: ‘I can confirm that an initial report has been submitted to the league. ‘It is normal procedure that once a report is received both clubs involved have seven days to submit a full report to the league and the disciplinary committee will then make a judgement.’ Richard Pierce-Saunderson, captain of Stradroke Vikings, said: ‘As far as I’m concerned both clubs have investigated the matter and the issue has been resolved.’ The Ipswich IVs declined to comment. Stradbroke is a small village with a population of around 1,500. It is around 25 miles north of Ipswich.","Neal Manning suffered grazes to his leg, arm and shoulder in Suffolk .

A human foot still wearing its athletic shoe washed onto a San Francisco beach Sunday morning. A black size 11.5 Puma sneaker contained the extremely decayed remains and no signs of the rest of the body were found. National Park Service personnel found the foot after a beachgoer called to report the gruesome sighting. Scroll down for video . Horror: This Puma containing a decayed human foot was found on a San Francisco beach Sunday. No sign of the rest of the body was found . 'What we have is a human foot, with some associated tissue, inside of a shoe,' Mark Powning, an investigator with the city's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, told the San Francisco Chronicle. The find at the city's Ocean Beach, while gory, is not all that uncommon. According to SFist, at least 13 or 14 such feet were found in the Pacific Northwest between 2007 and 2012. One theory about the origin of the feet--and their lack of a body--is that the shoe somehow protects the foot from being eaten or fully decomposing. Long gone: The gruesome discovery was made at Ocean Beach in San Francisco. Experts say the foot was likely rolling around on the ocean floor for a long time . As the body decays, the foot may detach and float away, eventually washing onto shore. This can even happen many years after death. Two feet that came ashore in 2011 were traced to a suicide in Vancouver from seven years prior. Mark Powning suggested something similar in the case of the San Francisco foot. 'It probably was rolling around the seabed for awhile,' he said.","The Puma was a size 11.5 .

A TV show contributor on Good Morning America was so scared of losing her job if she didn’t lose weight that she shed 72 pounds in one year. Entrepreneur and author, Tory Johnson, 43, has recently published a book, The Shift, about her quest to lose weight. She admits if she had not gone on a diet and lost weight, she would probably not be a contributor still on Good Morning America. Before and after: Tory Johnson, 43, lost 72 pounds because she was scared to lose her job on ABC's Good Morning America . Bigger: Johnson says she used to struggle with what to wear every time she went on Good Morning America . The moment that made her realise it . was a matter of ‘lose weight or lose your job’ was when she had her . first one-on-one meeting with ABC News’ highest-ranking woman, Barbara . Fedida. On that December morning in 2011, Johnson dressed herself in all black, hoping it would make her look slimmer for the meeting. The . two met at the ABC cafeteria where they talked about everything from . their kids and New York City public schools, to their husbands and the . ‘GMA’ ratings. But then the conversation changed, according to a personal column Johnson wrote in the New York Post. Slimmer: Now the TV star says losing weight has changed her life and helped her keep her job on the show . Inspiration: Johnson (left) says her conversation with ABC's Baraba Fedida (right), who hinted for her to 'lose weight or lose her job', did for her what doctors, family and friends never could . The Shift: Johnson's book on 'How I Finally Lost Weight and Discovered a Happier Life' ‘You don’t look as good as you could,’ Fedida told her. ‘I don’t think your clothing does you any favours.’ But instead of mentioning Johnson’s weight issue, she offered to connect her with a wardrobe stylist. At the end of the conversation, Fedida said: ‘I feel much better when I work out.’ ‘Not once did she call me fat, say I had to lose weight, or hint that my job was in jeopardy,’ writes Jonson in her column. ‘But what I did hear was, “Lose weight, or lose your job”,’ she writes. According to Johnson, the conversation she had with Fedida freed her to ‘finally tackle what I couldn’t ever do before’. By cutting carbohydrates, eating less and moving more, she lost 72 pounds — the basis for her new book, The Shift, which she dedicated to Fedida. Johnson says she is a ‘happier and healthier woman’ and for the first time in her life she now wears dresses. ‘Barbara did for me what doctors, family and friends never could,’ writes Johnson in her column in the New York Post. ‘Since then, friends have said they wish their bosses would tell them to lose weight because so far they haven’t listened to anyone else.’ Johnson added: ‘I’m forever grateful for her gentle grace during that difficult workplace chat that changed my life — may have even saved it.’ Apart from her work for the ABC, Johnson is also an entrepreneur and has built two multi-million-dollar businesses, Women For Hire and Spark & Hustle. She is also a New York Times bestselling author and has written six other books: Women For Hire: The Ultimate Guide to Getting a Job; Women For Hire's Get-Ahead Guide to Career Success; Take this Book to Work: How to Ask for (and Get) Money, Fulfillment, and Advancement; Will Work From Home: Earn the Cash Without the Commute; Fired to Hired: Bouncing Back from Job Loss to Get to Work Right Now; and her most recent book, Spark & Hustle: Launch and Grow Your Small Business Now.","Tory Johnson, 43, has published a book, The Shift, about how she lost weight .

Tropical Storm Manuel has swept onto Mexico's Pacific coast while Hurricane Ingrid swirls offshore on the other side of the country, and heavy rains and landslides caused at least 24 deaths and led authorities to evacuate thousands. Stormy conditions led some communities in affected states to cancel Independence Day celebrations planned for Sunday and Monday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Manuel began to weaken as soon as it made landfall near the port of Manzanillo on Sunday afternoon, but remains a threat to produce flash floods and mudslides. It is predicted to dissipate by Monday. Scroll down for video . Torrential: A couple wades in a flooded street in Acapulco following tropical storm Manuel which landed on the Pacific coast of Mexico on September 15 .

Evacuated: Inhabitants leave an area affected by floodings of Guamol river at Itsmo de Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, Mexico . In the southern coastal state of Guerrero, authorities said a landslide on the outskirts of Acapulco buried a house and killed six family members. Three people were swept to their deaths by a river, also on the edge of the resort city. A collapsing wall killed one person in the city. Elsewhere in Guerrero, six people died when their pickup truck skidded on a rain-swept highway in the mountains, and landslides killed two more people. The rains caused some rivers to overflow, damaging hundreds of homes and disrupting communications for several hours. Manuel had maximum sustained winds of about 40mph (65kph) and was moving to the northwest at 9mph (15kph) late Sunday afternoon. Its center was about 35 miles (60 kilometers) northwest of Manzanillo. Man power: Army soldiers work to pull their vehicle out of a flooded portion of road caused by Tropical Storm Manuel in the city of Chilpancingo, Mexico on Sunday . Rains from Ingrid caused landslides that killed three people in the central state of Puebla, and a woman died when a landslide buried her house in Hidalgo state. In the southern state of Oaxaca, which was affected by both storms, authorities said a child died after being swept away by a swollen river and a teenager was killed by a landslide. The hurricane center said Ingrid, the second hurricane of the Atlantic storm season, could reach the Mexican mainland by Monday morning. Manuel was expected to dump 10 to 15 inches of rain over parts of Guerrero and Michoacan state, with maximums of 25 inches possible in some isolated areas. Authorities said those rains would present an especially dangerous threat in mountains, where flash floods and mudslides were possible.

The September 15 and 16 celebrations commemorate Mexico's battle of independence from Spain. Officials in the Gulf state of Veracruz began evacuating coastal residents Friday night, and civil protection authorities said more than 6,600 people have been moved to shelters or the homes of family and friends. More than 1,000 homes in Veracruz state had been affected by the storm to varying degrees, and 20 highways and 12 bridges had damage, the state's civil protection authority said. A bridge collapsed near the northern Veracruz city of Misantla on Friday, cutting off the area from the state capital, Xalapa. A week ago, 13 people died in the state when a landslide buried their homes in heavy rains spawned by Tropical Depression Fernand. Officials in Tamaulipas state said 700 people have been evacuated from coastal communities.","Two storm systems are closing in on Mexico, causing mass destruction and claiming 24 lives so far .

The millionaire founder and CEO of the Panera Bread chain is currently attempting to live on just $4.50 a day as part of a campaign to show what it’s like for the millions of Americans who depend on food stamps. Ron Shaich, a keen advocate of large corporates giving back, started his low budget food shopping challenge on Saturday and has committed to doing to for an entire week. Shaich’s effort is part of the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) Challenge, designed to raise awareness that ‘nearly 48 million people receive food stamps and 16 million children go to bed hungry.’ Not many treats: Ron Shaich's shopping list for his week of living on $4.50 per day consists of a lot of carbs - pasta, lentils and chickpeas. He has almost $6 remaining for a sugar fix at some stage . As well as the millionaire businessman, 26 members of Congress - all democrats - are also trying to live on $4.50 per day. Blogging about the challenge on LinkedIn, Shaich wrote about the difficulties of trying to buy healthy food on a weekly budget of $31.50. To make his money stretch as far as possible, he visited an NSA Supermarket in Dorchester, Mass., to pick up food in preparation for the challenge. Shaich writes that he soon learned he was going to have to forgo meat, fruit, vegetables and his favorite granola and instead load up on filling, carb-heavy foods. Shaich's tight budget mean't he had to forgo his favorite foods including coffee, pistachios and granola . Shiach spent $25.95 on his trip to the grocery store and bought mainly pasta, lentils and chickpeas . In total, Shaich spent $25.95 - mainly on pasta, lentils and chickpeas - leaving him with just $6 for the rest of the week. He admitted there’s a good chance he’ll use his remaining amount on a sugar fix at some point during the week. ‘This isn't going to be easy. In fact, it’s going to be incredibly hard,’ he wrote last Friday. ‘I haven’t even felt the first pangs of hunger, and I’m already gaining a whole new perspective into challenges that so many people in this country face in dealing with food insecurity - from the embarrassment of having to leave items at the register to the diligence and ongoing calculation required to constantly prioritize and rank every purchase and potential purchase, big and small.’ The House of Representatives could vote this week to cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, by 5.2 percent. That would mean up to six million Americans would be forced off of food assistance, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Shaich says his intention is not to ‘trivialize anyone else’s experience’ but merely to help spread a deeper awareness of America's growing food instability problem. Panera Bread a $3 billion a year business with some 1,600 outlets in the U.S. Panera Bread operates five 'Panera Cares Community Cafes' where there is no cash register and customers pay with suggested donations . His restaurant chain is a $3 billion a . year business with some 1,600 outlets in the U.S. but at five of those . cafes customers are able to pay whatever they choose for what they eat. The . unusual concept is part of an initiative by the company to help some of . the millions of Americans who can’t afford to eat on a regular basis. The . five special restaurants operate under the ‘Panera Cares Café’ brand . and instead of cash registers, donation boxes sit on the counter, with . signs telling customers: ‘Take what you need; leave your fair share.’ When the cashiers take meal orders, they hand receipts to customers which show how much the food would normally cost, and then the customer decides how much to leave in the box or to take off their credit card. The concept of a pay-what-you-can restaurant isn't new, but Panera is the first major corporation to do it . The first cafe opened in the St. Louis suburb of Clayton in May 2010 and since then four others have . opened in Dearborn, Portland, Chicago and Boston. Between then, these five cafes are expected to serve more than a million people in 2013. The concept of a pay-what-you-can restaurant isn’t new, but Panera is the first major corporation to do it. Shaich thinks other major companies should start to do the same. 'Home Depot has the capability of . helping after major storms. The Gap could run thrift stores,' he told . Quartz earlier this year.

The heartbroken 6-year-old son of a Utah police officer looked on as nearly 10,000 people gathered in the Maverick Center outside of Salt Lake City to honor his father, who was senselessly shot last week in the line of duty. Ben Johnson and his mother, Shante Johnson, held flags in honor of their father and husband (respectively), as six Draper police officers escorted the flag-covered casket of Sergeant Derek Johnson - who authorities say was fatally shot by a pair of drug addicts on Sunday - to the front of an arena packed with fellow officers, family, friends and supporters. Meanwhile, 34-year-old former model Traci Vaillancourt - who lost her looks and was left hooked on painkillers after getting a rare blood disease - and her boyfriend, Timothy 'Troy' Walker, are recovering from their own, self-inflicted wounds in police custody.

Walker then turned the weapon on himself . and has been hospitalized alongside his long-term partner since. They . are both in a critical condition. According to the Salt Lake Tribune, Johnson’s wife, Shante Sidwell Johnson, wearing black, carried the couple’s 6-year-old son, ""little buddy"" Bensen Ray. Draper Police Chief Bryan Roberts, who . conducted the service, told the thousands filling the Maverik Center: 'It’s inspiring to stand here in front of you. Your support gives me . strength.' Police are waiting to speak to . Vaillancourt to hear her account of what happened and to find out if she . knew about her boyfriend's intention to kill. Officers suspect the pair were on drugs when Sgt Johnson spotted their car parked awkwardly. Speaking in response to the crime, Vaillancourt's sister Victoria King has revealed her sister's tragic demise from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman reliant on her violent boyfriend. Accused: Timothy Walker allegedly shot Sgt. Derek Johnson dead before turning the gun on his girlfriend and himself . After having her first child, Vaillancourt was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called Hereditary Angioedema which made her face, throat and limbs swell, her sister told KSL.com. She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30. 'It just went downhill from there,' King told the broadcaster. 'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.' 'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added. King last saw her sister and Walker, 35, the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behavior. 'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said. The couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister. Detectives are now waiting at Intermountain Medical Center, where the couple are being treated to question them about the shooting. They have a daughter together who lives in full custody of her paternal grandmother. Ms King told Salt Lake Tribune that her sister was not without remorse at what had become of her life but couldn't work her way out of the cycle of addiction. 'She would cry, ‘I never pictured my life turning out like this,’' King told the newspaper. According to King, Walker gave Vaillancourt attention and Vaillancourt 'was attached to him at the hip'. For more video, please go to KSL . Online: In this photograph posted by friends on Facebook they expressed dismay at what had become of the girl they loved, right . She says the pair have been living in and out of motels and were most recently living out of their car. She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago. My heart is absolutely bleeding for Derek Johnson’s family,' King added in the interview. 'I just want them to know I’m sorry'. Walker has a history of petty crime but nothing that would indicate the murder he is accused of carrying out on Sunday. Vaillancourt too has a record of theft and shoplifting but nothing violent.

'Understanding the risk, but wanting to protect he gave his life while on duty Sept. 1, 2013, at the age of 32.' He was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a 6-year-old son Bensen. 'He was the recipient of many awards, including Life Saving Award, Distinguished Service Award, and was the 2012 Community Policing Officer of the Year.

He loved his family, hunting, running, hiking and giving service. He was always up for a good challenge,' it reads. The police officer, promoted last year, tried to drive away after the shooting and crashed his patrol car into a field. The owner, Dan Smith, hung ribbons in his memory. 'There's no words that can explain it and make it ok,' Smith said. 'It obviously tugs at your heartstrings and you want to do something to show that it wasn't in vain.'

Cher has turned down the chance to open next year's Winter Olympics in Russia as a protest to the country's new anti-gay laws. The singer refused the offer in retaliation of legislation introduced earlier this year which makes it illegal to teach under 18s about homosexuality. The 67-year-old, whose son Chaz underwent gender transition surgery in 2010, is the latest celebrity to react against the laws brought in by Vladimir Putin's government in June. She said: ‘I can’t name names but my friend called who is a big oligarch over there and asked me if I’d like to be an ambassador for the Olympics and open the show. ‘I immediately said no. I want to know why all of this gay hate just exploded over there. He said the Russian people don’t feel the way their government does.’ Cher, who this year headlined at a Gay Pride concert in New York, admitted feeling ‘frightened’ after her daughter Chaz told her she was having surgery to become a man in 2008 .

Senior Lib Dems today slapped down Vince Cable for claiming the coalition could break up before the 2015 election. Treasury minister Danny Alexander dismissed his Cabinet colleague's suggestion that it is ‘a possibility’ that . the power sharing deal with the Tories will collapse before 2015. Business Secretary Mr Cable stunned colleagues by also indicating . that he has private ‘red lines’ that would prompt him to walk out of the . Cabinet. Row: Relations have soured between Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and Vince Cable in recent weeks as divisions emerged over the economy . The Lib Dem conference in Glasgow has been dominated by the increasingly erratic behaviour of Mr Cable, attacking Tory coalition partners and distancing himself from the government's economic recovery. Senior allies of Nick Clegg have grown irritated by what they see as disloyalty which risks undermining the key messages the party has on fairness and economic competence. The veteran minister also faced Tory . anger last night after dismissing his Conservative colleagues as . ‘nasty’, ‘callous’ and ‘ugly’ opportunists. Asked . at a fringe meeting at the Lib Dem conference whether anything would . ever compel him to quit the Coalition, Mr Cable made clear he has . privately considered quitting the Government. ‘I . think President Obama has just proven very eloquently in recent weeks . the dangers of parading your red lines in public,’ he said. ‘I am not going to do an Obama.’ Asked . whether the Government might collapse, Mr Cable said: ‘It’s certainly . possible. We are not at the stage of talking about that process. It is . obviously a highly sensitive one.’ But Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and a key ally to Mr Clegg, rubbished the idea the coalition would break-up. He told Sky News: 'This coalition will continue until the end of this Parliament, as we promised. 'We have a very big job to do to clean up the economic mess that Labour left behind and to entrench the recovery that we are starting to see. 'To make sure that we create the jobs in this country that need to be created, that we deliver the big tax cuts for millions of working people that we promised, that we continue the process of sorting out the financial system.' Mr Alexander added: 'We are not going to walk away from that job months or years before the end of the coalition Government.' Baroness Grender, former head of communications for the Lib Dems, said she also believes the coalition will last until the next general election. Asked whether the Government might collapse, Mr Cable said: ¿It¿s certainly possible' Allies of Mr Cable have privately . suggested that if there is a hung Parliament, he could become Chancellor . in a coalition with Labour and oust Mr Clegg as Lib Dem leader – a move . they call ‘Plan V’. In an . overture to Labour, Mr Cable said it was his ‘working assumption’ that . the Lib Dems should pick a future coalition partner based on the number . of seats, rather than votes, that they win – a formula that favours . Labour since the electoral system gives it an advantage. In his main speech to the conference in Glasgow, Mr Cable, a former member of the Labour Party, said Labour had ‘fallen asleep at the wheel’ in the run up to the financial crash. But he then launched an intemperate attack on the Conservatives, making clear that he holds them in contempt. Mr Cable said: ‘The Tories’ friends and donors were at the heart of the greed and recklessness which lay behind that disaster.’ Mr Cable directly contradicted Nick Clegg who has said the Coalition will survive until polling day . He accused the Conservatives of ‘callous’ behaviour towards immigrants, unions and benefit claimants and attacked the Tories’ election strategist Lynton Crosby, whom he labelled ‘an Australian Rottweiler’. Branding the Conservatives the ‘Tea Party Tories’, Mr Cable criticised what he called their ‘blinkered, small-state ideology’. He said: ‘Theresa May once characterised the Tories as the nasty party. After a few years of trying to be nice and inclusive it has reverted to type. ‘The list of people the Tories disapprove of is even longer than that. Public sector workers, the unmarried, people who don’t own property. We must not allow them to turn the clock back.’ He added: ‘That is not our kind of politics. It is ugly.’ Mr Cable even warned that Tory allies could spark a new financial collapse. He dismissed David Cameron’s depiction of him as Jeremiah – the Old Testament prophet of doom – saying ‘Jeremiah was right’ that ‘Jerusalem would be overrun by the armies of Nebuchadnezzar’. Mr Cable claimed: ‘Gordon Brown’s new Jerusalem was overcome by an army of estate agents, property speculators and bankers. ‘The problem we now have is the invaders are back and they have a bridgehead in London and the south-east of England, and they have got to be stopped.’ The Business Secretary’s outburst appalled even his own colleagues and was met with only muted applause from party members. One fellow Lib Dem minister dismissed his speech as ‘just awful’. Another said: ‘To say that I was unimpressed would be an understatement.’ Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘If Vince Cable dislikes his own government so much the honourable thing to do would be to leave it.’ His colleague Stewart Jackson branded Mr Cable ‘infantile’ and called for him to resign. He said: ‘I’m more than happy for Vince Cable to be in opposition to his own Government. Just give up salary, red boxes and the flunkies first. ‘Lib Dems forget that without the Conservative Party they’d still be a knit your own tofu pressure group rather than a responsible party of government.’","Business Secretary said it's possible that Tory coalition will end .

An unarmed man seeking help after a car crash over the weekend was shot 10 times by the Charlotte police officer who's now charged in his death, investigators said Monday. The release of the information supporting the voluntary manslaughter charge came at the end of a day that also included the first public remarks by victim Jonathan A. Ferrell's family. A family attorney and representatives of the NAACP questioned whether race played a role in the shooting of the black man by a white officer. Family: Willie Ferrell, left, talks about his relationship with his older brother, Jonathan Ferrell, as attorney Christopher Chestnut, center, his mother, Georgia Ferrell, right, listen . Ferrell's family said the former Florida A&M University football player moved to Charlotte about a year ago to be with his fiancee and was working two jobs. He wanted to go back to school and eventually become an automotive engineer. 'You took a piece of my heart that I can never put back,' said Ferrell's mother, Georgia Ferrell, as she clutched a stuffed Winnie the Pooh doll her 24-year-old son loved as a child. Officer Randall Kerrick fired 12 times at Ferrell early on Saturday morning while responding to a breaking and entering call, hitting him 10 times. Kerrick is scheduled for a first court appearance Tuesday on the voluntary manslaughter charge. Investigators revealed on Monday that officer Randall Kerrick, right, shot ex-FAMU football player Jonathan Ferrell, 24, ten times . NAACP leaders gathered on Monday to . both praise police for quickly filing charges and to complain about how . the shooting didn't surprise them considering portrayals of black men in . popular culture and previous instances of racially inflected violence. Ferrell family attorney Chris Chestnut wondered Monday what role race may have played in Saturday's shooting. 'The officer is white, Mr. Ferrell is black. This might be more of a reflection of where we are as a country,' he said. The . encounter was set in motion around 2:30 a.m. Saturday when Ferrell's . car ran off the entrance road to a sprawling suburban neighborhood that . was carved out of farmland about a decade ago some 15 miles from . downtown Charlotte. A sign near the crash site advertises a neighborhood . watch meeting in a few days. After . crashing his car into trees, Ferrell kicked out the back window and . walked half a mile up a hill to the first set of closely-clustered . houses he could see. Brotherly love: Jonathan Ferrell's brother Willie said. 'Jonathan was never the type of person to harm nobody' Bradfield Farm, 17 miles east of Charlotte, is a community of 1000 white . two-story homes, it also has four tennis courts, two swimming pools and a clubhouse. New and resale houses are . available in the $110,000 - $230,000 range. Ferrell then started 'banging on the door viciously' of a home to attract attention, Police Chief Rodney Monroe said. The . woman inside answered, thinking it was her husband coming home late . from work. When she saw Ferrell, she shut the door and called police. Monroe said he didn't think the unarmed Ferrell made threats. Officers responding to the breaking and entering call found Ferrell on a road that only leads to the neighborhood's pool. Ferrell . ran toward the officers, who tried to stop him with a Taser. Police . said he continued to run toward them when Kerrick shot him. Ferrell died . at the scene. Chestnut, who has spoken with police officials, said that Kerrick didn't identify himself as a police officer. A . small pot of flowers and red balloons were placed on the spot. Orange . spray paint was the only other indication of where Ferrell died. Lance . LoRusso, an attorney and former police officer, said it's unusual for a . police officer to be charged so quickly after a shooting. He said there . is generally a waiting period while investigators review the evidence. Upscale community: After crashing his car, Jonathon Ferrell climbed out the back window and made his way to Bradfield Farm, pictured . 'There . are a couple of reasons why police take their time. First of all it . takes time to develop things like the toxicology report to determine . what happened. 'You . have to wait until daylight to reconstruct the crime scene. You have to . interview all the people involved. And the officer is given the . opportunity to decompress before making a statement,' he said. Ferrell's mother said Kerrick had no business being a police officer if he couldn't react properly to a man who needed help. 'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said. His family painted a picture of a bright man with an 'infectious smile' who was always there for his brothers and sisters. 'He . was a role model,' said his brother, Frank. 'He had so much love in his . heart. And he was always concerned about his family.' What might have been: Georgia Ferrell holds a stuffed bear and talks of how she had promised to give the bear to her son's first born child . 'He . had dreams of being an automotive engineer. He wanted to design a car . from the very last bolt to the interior,' his brother said. He . said he didn't know where his brother was going that night, or why he . got into the accident. But he said his brother had never been in trouble . before. Several people in the neighborhood where Ferrell went after the crash refused to talk to a reporter on Monday. A . Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police car was in one driveway just up the hill . from Ferrell's wreck. No one answered the door at that home. Ferrell . was at least the sixth person to be shot by Charlotte-Mecklenburg . officers since the start of 2012. Four of them have died. Georgia Ferrell: 'I truly forgive him. I pray for him. And I pray that he gets off the police force,' Georgia Ferrell said. 'You took a piece of my heart that I can never get back' Charlotte . police investigate their own officers involved in shootings. The State . Bureau of Investigation can step in if requested, but they haven't been . asked to do so in any recent officer-involved shootings. In . the other shootings, prosecutors decided not to charge the officers . involved and an independent panel of citizens that investigates the . police ruled the shootings were justified.

Navy Yards where 12 people were shot dead and eight others were injured on Monday morning. A yet-to-be-released government audit reveals that federal oversight investigators concluded that the reduced security measures at the base left security risks unaddressed. A report by the Department of Defense Inspector General's office shows that they were concerned about the access that would be granted to outside contractors- like that of Aaron Alexis, the suspect who was killed by police during the Monday morning shooting. Scroll down for video . Gaining access: A yet-unreleased report shows that officials were aware of possible holes in security procedures at the Navy Yards, where a shooting spree on Monday left 12 victims dead as well as the shooter . Piecing together information: SWAT agents remained on the scene for much of Monday (pictured), hours after Alexis was shot by one of the responding officers . His target: The shooting took place inside Building 179 at the D. C. Navy Yards . The report states that the Navy 'did not effectively mitigate access control risks associated with contractor installation access' to the Navy Yards. Caught and killed: Aaron Alexis, 34, was identified as the shooter and had 'multiple engagements' with police firing shots at the officers during the shooting spree Monday . Time Magazine published excerpts from the report after having been read portions by an unidentified federal official who had access to the Inspector General's findings. The security risks are placed squarely on the Navy administrators who were trying 'to reduce access control costs'. The process of gaining access to the administrative facility- where about 3,000 people work- is under severe scrutiny. In a Monday night press conference, FBI assistant D.C. director in charge Valerie Parlave said that they concluded he had legitimately accessed the building as his status as a contractor would have given him sufficient credentials to enter unquestioned. 'He utilized a valid pass,' Ms Parlave said during the press conference. Alexis, 34, became a full-time Navy reservist in 2007 but was dismissed in 2011 following a series of 'misconduct' violations. As a contractor for a group working for a subcontractor used by Hewlett-Packard, Alexis had the proper identification to be allowed into Navy Yard's Building 179 where he began shooting. 'He did have a secret clearance. And he did have a CAC (common access card),' said Thomas Hoshko, CEO of subcontracting group The Experts Inc who employed Alexis. Worrying: FBI investigators determined that Alexis gained access to the facility legitimately, using the ID he was given as a sanctioned contractor who was working on the site . Collecting guns: Alexis reportedly brought only one gun with him to the Navy Yard and procured two others during the shooting spree . Asked when Alexis was supposed to . start work, Hoshko told Reuters that it was unclear when Alexis was . supposed to start his latest stint in the government facility: 'That's . what I got to find out, if he was supposed to start today ... It's not . clear to me.' 'We had . just recently re-hired him. Another background investigation was re-run . and cleared through the defense security service in July 2013.' Another . problem with Alexis that should have been flagged up by the security . access system is that he had two prior arrests- one in 2004 for shooting . someone's tires in an anger-fueled 'blackout' and another in 2010 when . he said that he accidentally fired into a neighbor's apartment while . cleaning his gun. The security assessment report cites the . fact that a number of people with criminal histories were able to . bypass the Navy Yard's security without any alarm. Time reports that the audit cited 52 instances where 'convicted felons received routine unauthorized installation access, placing military personnel, attendants, civilians in installations at an increased security risk.' The research into the security inefficiencies at Navy Yard began in September 2012 and carried on through August of this year. The final report will be published within the next 30 days.","Federal security assessment conducted over the past year pointed out that contractors were given too much access at the Navy Yards .

The $10million home recently bought by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is undergoing major renovations. In the Dolores Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, CA., the home is slated for over $1 million in improvements, according to city building permit requests filed by a contractor. The 5,542-square-foot, four-bedroom home was bought by Mr Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan last fall. Home away from home: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's second home, in toney Dolores Heights, is undergoing almost $2million in renovations . Close to the popular Dolores Park, the billionaire power couple’s home away from home is tucked neatly into the hilly neighbourhood on the edge of the Mission District, according to reports. The first family of Facebook also owns a mansion in suburban Palo Alto – near company headquarters. First reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, the repairs aim to transform the house. Additions to multiple floors, new windows, a new roof and custom landscaping are estimated to come in at a cool $750,000. A first-floor office, media room, half bathroom, mud room, laundry room, wine room and wet bar are estimated to cost $720,000. That permit also details remodelling of the second, third and fourth floors, as well as a new bathroom on the second floor. Milennial mogul: Mr Zuckerberg's worth is in the billions, making him one of the richest people in San Francisco . An overhauled kitchen and bathroom come to $65,000. To nurture someone’s green thumb, a $60,000 greenhouse. Finally, a new exterior wall and stairway, as well as further earthquake-proofing, are expected to tally about $30,000. All added up, the initial estimate is about $1.6million, but those initial estimates often rise. ‘Workers at the site tell us they wouldn't be surprised if the final tab comes to several million more,’ said the Chronicle, adding the gut renovation will take about a year. Stripped to the studs, the house’s garage is even getting an upgrade – with a turntable pad, the Chronicle reported. Lucky dog: Mr Zuckerberg, wife Priscilla and their dog own two homes in the Bay Area . Though not publicly discussed by the recently-married college sweethearts, the home’s new owners were confirmed to the newspaper by a local politician. Supervisor Scott Weiner leaked to the paper his knowledge of the home’s buyers, but lamented not running into them yet. The fixer-upper was ‘purchased through a holding company run by a lawyer who specializes in forming trusts for high-end clients,’ reported the Chronicle. Spokespersons for both Zuckerberg and Facebook declined to comment to the Chronicle and could not be reached by MailOnline.

She says the pair have been living in and out of motels and were most recently living out of their car. She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago.

A 23-year-old nurse who bumped into a man who allegedly tried to rape and kill her on a Mumbai train was overcome with fury and launched into a rage repeatedly slapping the man. The handcuffed man was held back by two policemen while the woman yelled at him and hit him, naturally being filled with rage at seeing her alleged attacker. The confrontation, which was captured on the police station's CCTV, comes just days after four Indian men were sentenced to death for the brutal bus gang rape of Jyoti Singh who eventually died of her injuries. Scroll down for video . Rage: A 23-year-old nurse who bumped into a man she accused of trying to rape and kill her on a train was filled with fury and began slapping the man . Anger and frustration among women in India has been increasing as violent attacks on girls are frequently being reported and the government has been forced to address the growing issue. Seizing the rare opportunity of having the upper hand, this nurse struggled to hold back these feelings, as she repeatedly hit her alleged attacker. According to NDTV.com, the nurse had been travelling on an early morning train in Mumbai on July 27 when a 'drunk man' boarded her carriage. The 27-year-old man tried to force himself on her. She alleges he tried to rape her; he has also been charged with attempted murder, the news service said. Outraged: The woman had gone to the police to report the alleged attack which happened on an early local train in Mumbai as she travelled to work . Police said she accused the man of boarding the train drunk and then trying to rape her . The woman raised the alarm and the man was arrested when he got off at the next station . The nurse raised the alarm on the train and when her attacker got off at the next station, the man was arrested by the local railway police. The woman went to the police station herself to report the crime and while she was there officers brought in her alleged attacker. They had just completed a medical examination on the man. Clearly extremely upset, and then outraged when she saw the man, the nurse confronted him. Police said she wanted to talk to him and give him a piece of her mind, but the exchange became  more heated. The news service says while no one should take the law into their own hands, the police understood her state of mind at the time, and she was still outraged at the alleged attack. There were at least three police officers in the room, watching, at times more people come and go. The news service points out that despite her lasing out, the woman 'bravely' continued to lodge her complaint. In India, many women have been too afraid to report such crimes, for fear of being shunned in public and due to police corruption in parts.

Guilty: Vinay Sharma (left), 20, and Mukesh Kumar, 26, have also been ordered to the gallows over the attack . NDTV.com also noted that every train in Mumbai should have a police constable on it patrolling the carriages, but on this occasion there was none, because he had apparently missed the train. A 'dereliction of duty' charge has now been registered against that constable. On average, a case of rape in India is reported every 21 minutes, but it was only after the horrific fatal gang rape and torture of Jyoti Singh last December received global media attention, that the government has has stepped up its reaction to the crime. The victim, who was raped for an hour and tortured with an iron rod on a moving bus, became a symbol of the dangers women face in a country. Noose: An Indian woman protestor demands the death penalty outside the court yesterday . After violent protests in several cities the government, initially caught off guard, introduced tougher rape laws in March, and for the first time opened conversation about gender crime in television debates, social media and even Bollywood. Still, sex crimes remain commonplace in India, and social commentators say patriarchal attitudes towards women have not been diluted by more than a decade of rapid economic growth.","Nurse, 23, couldn't contain her rage when confronted with alleged attacker .

Gary Warwick, 62, was snagged Thursday at a Portage, IN., restaurant by authorities from three separate agencies. He has been charged with murder in connection with the death of Joseph Henry Abernathy III, a one-year-old toddler found dead on Dec 30, 1972. Did he do it?: Accused baby-killer Gary Warwick, 62, was arrested for the death of a toddler over 40 years ago . Mr Warwick’s arrest was carried out by US Marshals, Portage Police and the St Clair County Sheriff, according to reports. The wanted man was long-suspected in the baby’s brutal beating death, according to BND. Long-since gone cold, the case was reopened last year by the Sheriff after seeing a YouTube video titled ‘Justice for Joey.’ A . subsequent investigation spanning Indiana and Arkansas led . investigators to arrest Mr Warwick at the Texas Roadhouse restaurant in . Portage last week, said the Times. Despite a history of not fleeing, the . accused baby-killer’s bail was set at a whopping $5million, according to . reports, to which attorney James Gomric vehemently protested. ‘Warwick lived in the same city for decades with his wife, children and grandchildren. He did not flee even though he knew charges were possible,’ Mr Gomric told BND. ‘The setting of a $5 million bail is inappropriate in this case,’ the lawyer said to BND, declining to comment further. An assistant softball coach with Purdue University, Mr Warwick initially faced murder charges over the toddler’s death in 1973, which multiple reports said were dismissed. Officials reportedly believed that the baby hit his head falling out of the crib, causing him to die, according to Northwest Indiana Times. End of the line: Mr Warwick was arrested Thursday at this Portage, IN., restaurant . ‘Back in 1972, if you told someone a baby fell out of a crib, then that's what people thought had happened,’ Sheriff Rick Watson told the St Louis Post-Dispatch, according to the Times. In the time since, Mr Warwick has seen his family grow to two married daughters and three grandchildren, according to the school’s website. Mr Warwick was not related to the baby, but lived in the same house as him at the time of his death. Investigators are still building their case against their man, but are confident. ‘It's finally been brought to closure, but it's never over. It's innocent until proven guilty, and that's why the investigation continues,’ the Sheriff told NWI.","Gary Warwick, 62, was arrested at a restaurant in Portage, Indiana .

Barclays will have to refund £100million next month after 300,000 customers were overcharged because of paperwork blunders. The bank admitted yesterday it had breached the Consumer Credit Act by wrongly charging interest to personal loan customers in a series of errors dating back to 2008. Up to 300,000 Barclays customers could be in line for a windfall of a few hundred pounds each as repayment for the errors, which relate to arrears notices and statements. Payout: Up to 300,000 Barclays customers could receive a few hundred pounds each . But the full extent of the errors is not yet known. The refunds will be given to personal loan customers, but the bank has . revealed it is now reviewing all its businesses – including Barclaycard – . to assess them for similar problems. This raises the prospect of even more refunds – Barclaycard has more than ten million customers in the UK. Buried on page 28 of its 10,000-word prospectus, Barclays said it had 'identified certain issues with the information contained in historic statements and arrears notices relating to consumers loan accounts. It is therefore implementing a plan to return interest incorrectly charged to customers'. Barclays says those affected will be contacted and that customers do not need to take any action themselves. The admission comes as Barclays faces a £50million fine over allegations it channelled more than £300million in secret fees to Middle Eastern investors during an emergency fundraising at the height of the financial crisis. The embattled lender said it is appealing against the huge penalty from watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, which has branded its behaviour ‘reckless’. News that it is facing another huge fine will come as a blow to beleaguered investors and chief executive Antony Jenkins, who is trying to both restore the bank’s reputation as well as get its finances in order. It follows the £59million fine levied on the bank last summer for rigging Libor interest rates by defunct regulator the Financial Services Authority. The allegations surround fees paid when Barclays went cap in hand to Qatari investors in June and October of 2008. Barclays . is accused of making improper payments worth £322million to oil the wheels of . the deal. This saw Qatar Holding, part of the state-owned investment . authority of Qatar, pump £5.3billion into the bank by snapping up new shares. Facing allegations: Barclays is accused of making improper payments worth £322million to Qatari investors . The deal, sealed at the height of the financial crisis, helped Barclays avoid going to the Government for taxpayer support. But it has come back to haunt the bank. It is accused by the FCA of acting ‘recklessly’ and breaching stock market rules by failing to disclose the fees to investors  in the prospectus issued at the time. The bank is battling the allegations and said the fees were paid for advice. It is also being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office as well as US authorities. Barclays said that adverse findings could lead to fines, ‘possible criminal liability’. The dispute could go to a tribunal and  take months to be finalised. The watchdog issued warning notices to Barclays last week, including notification of the financial penalty. A Barclays spokesman said of the personal loan blunder: ‘Barclays has proactively reviewed information it has historically sent to its customers relating to interest charges where we have found technical documentary errors. ‘As a result Barclays has identified certain issues with the information contained in some statements and arrears notices relating to consumer loan accounts. ‘Due to these notification errors, interest was not due on certain accounts during the period that Barclays made this mistake, and whilst no one has been mis-sold to, customers are entitled to have their interest payments returned. No customer will pay more than they were ever contractually expected to. ‘Barclays has notified the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) which is responsible for consumer credit issues and is implementing a plan to return interest payments to customers as swiftly and efficiently as possible. ‘Barclays is undertaking a review of all its businesses where similar issues could arise to assess any related issues.'","Blunders relate to personal loans dating back to October 2008 .

A corporate lawyer today revealed the moment she felt ‘pure terror’ when she discovered a fox licking her sleeping six-year-old daughter’s face after it sneaked into their London home. Jo Williams said she did a double take when she saw the urban scavenger on top of her daughter Ava’s bed on the fourth floor of the family’s £1.5 million house in Clapham, south London. Luckily, little Ava was not harmed after Ms Williams chased the fox around the house for 90 minutes before it escaped out a roof window. Intruder: This fox was found licking a six-year-old girl's face as she slept in her bed in south London before it was chased out by the girl's mother . Ms Williams, 40, was working in her office next to Ava’s bedroom when she heard a loud thud. She rushed into the room to find a fox licking around the girl’s chin and mouth as she slept. She said the fox may have been attracted by a fruit-flavoured moisturising cream applied to treat Ava’s dry skin. Ms Williams chased it into a spare room before calling on a neighbour to help get the fox out of the house because her husband was out. Mother-of-two Ms Williams said: ‘I went to check on her and saw this fox on top of her with its tail all puffed out, looking really scary. ‘It looked at me then took another lick of Ava’s chin. I had a few seconds of pure terror where I just froze to the spot. Unwanted house guest: Jo Williams, Ava's mother, called on people not to feed foxes in a bid to stop them coming close to residential areas . Left the door open: Ms Williams left the back door of the £1.5million family home in Clapham (pictured) open the night that the fox got into the house . ‘I rushed to pick Ava up and took her out the room, but it took another hour-and-a-half before I could get the fox out. It had messed all over the room. It was revolting.’ In 2010, nine-month-old twin girls Lola and Isabella Koupparis suffered horrific injuries when they were mauled by a fox as they slept in their cots at their family home in Hackney, east London after the patio doors were left open. Incredibly this time, little Ava slept through the latest drama and was not injured. Her mother believes the fox got in through the back door of the house in a leafy suburban street, near Clapham Common in south London, which had been propped open as it was a balmy evening at around 8pm on Tuesday September 3. She said: ‘I won’t be leaving it open again.’ Ms Williams called on people to stop feeding foxes as she believes attracts them into urban areas. She said: ‘A lot of people feed the foxes, but they forget they are vermin. ‘I think if people stopped feeding them there would be a lot less around and things like this wouldn’t happen. ‘You hear about the fox attacks on children and after the shock and the adrenaline you realise what a lucky escape we had. ‘When I walked in I just did this cartoon double take, I was like “what is this?” I was just so shocked. After I realised the fox had not mauled my child, the adrenaline just kicked in. But afterwards, of course I was terrified - you just keep thinking what could have happened. ‘My little girl does not know anything about it. She was asleep the whole time. After it happened I tried to wake her, but she was still in that first stage of sleep. I’m now glad she doesn’t know. Defence mechanism: Foxes are not naturally aggressive but do attack if they feel threatened (file photo) ‘Thankfully there have been no . ill-effects, but who knows what sort of diseases foxes carry? I’m just . so relieved it didn’t savage her.’ A spokesman for The Mammal Society said although foxes are not naturally aggressive they will attack when they feel threatened. She . said: ‘In this case the fox could indeed have been attracted by the . girl’s face cream, but he could have been licking her face in the same . way a dog would and had no intention to attack her. ‘When . a fox attacks it is purely a last resort defence mechanism. It’s out of . fear, not out of aggression, usually if they are approached by humans . or can’t find their way out of somewhere. ‘But foxes are becoming more habituated to human environments largely due to the abundance of food in urban areas. ‘People can unintentionally encourage foxes by leaving food out in the garden for other animals. Some people leave food scraps or cat food out for hedgehogs, for example. And foxes eat anything so they’ll go for it. ‘To minimise the chance of a fox getting in the house people should make sure their bins are well maintained and try not to tame them as they need to still be scared of you. If they lose that fear they become more bold and that’s potentially when they get into houses.’ While Ava was lucky to be left untouched by the fox, other children have been less fortunate. Earlier this year, five-week-old baby Denny Dolan was mauled by a fox in his family living room in south London earlier this year. His mother Hayley Crawley wrestled with the fox and fought it off but her son was left soaked in blood and had gashes to his face and a black eye where the fox hit him against the door frame. Bedside vigil: Denny Dolan lying in his hospital bed after he was attacked by a fox in his home in south London earlier this year.

Denny had to have his finger reattached . in surgery and needed stitches to his cheek, as well as treatment for . injuries to his face and head. Lola and her twin sister Isabella Koupparis fell victim to the fox in 2010 when it crept in through patio doors left open in the heat. Isabella, who was the more badly hurt of the pair with ‘life changing’ injuries to her arms. Their mother, Pauline, described the attack as ‘looking like something from a horror movie’. In January this year, terrified jogger Clare Laudy, 17, fought off a fox that sank its teeth into her leg after it leapt out of the darkness and bit her as she ran in Epsom, Surrey. Brave pet owner Vicky Reeves was forced to wrestle her two-year-old Chihuahua Lexi from the jaws of a fox in her back garden in Laindon, Essex in 2012. The 29-year-old heard screams and ran out to find the fox had jumped over the fence and was attacking Lexi - leaving the dog with severe bite wounds to her neck.

A brain-damaged former motorbike stuntman last night revealed he blamed himself for suffering humiliating beatings from his now-jailed wife. Father-of-three Eddie Kidd, 54, of Peacehaven, East Sussex, was kicked and strangled in front of carers by former stripper Samantha, 44, who told the daredevil he was ‘a f****** spastic’. Mr Kidd was one of the world's most famous stunt riders until he suffered serious head and pelvic injuries following a failed stunt jump in 1996 in Warwickshire which left him unable to walk. Shocking: Father-of-three Eddie Kidd (left), 54, of East Sussex, was kicked and strangled in front of carers by former stripper Samantha (right), 44, who told the daredevil he was 'a f****** spastic' He told The Sun on Sunday: ‘She had started drinking heavily and would just change. She would slap me in the face and punch me in the chest and arms, strangle me and say horrible things. ‘As a man, any man, to be beaten by your wife is desperately humiliating and, in a way, shameful.  I ended up blaming myself - thinking she had taken too much - or, that it was my fault. ‘I took on so much when I was riding. Then after all the stunts, all the fanfare, I am sat in a chair being beaten by my wife and there is nothing I can do.’ Mrs Kidd was arrested for domestic violence last December after her husband’s family reported her to police days after the couple split up. She was jailed for five months for four assaults last month. Dramatic: Mr Kidd jumps over five cars in a 1976 stunt. He was one of the most famous stunt riders in the world until he suffered serious head and pelvic injuries after a failed stunt jump in 1996 . Speaking in his first interview since her sentencing, some of Mr Kidd’s words were translated by one of his three carers. The crash left him unable to talk or walk unaided and he requires full-time care. Former James Bond stuntman Mr Kidd - who has three children from previous marriages - was left shaking and 'absolutely hysterical' by her actions, Brighton Magistrates' Court was told last month. Mr Kidd, who was previously married to dancer Debbie Ash and ex-Stringfellows nightclub waitress Sarah Carr, first met his wife in 1988. They met again at a party in Mayfair in 2004 and later wed. The court heard that Mrs Kidd, who once appeared in children’s TV show Byker Grove, assaulted her husband three times at their home and once in Southampton between July and October last year. Popular: Mr Kidd is pictured (left) with Page 3 girl Gina Charles in 1982 and (right) with singer-songwriter Lynsey de Paul in 1985. He has three children from previous marriages . In one incident, Mr Kidd rained a series of blows on him after she was woken up, a witness told the court. She was said to have told him: 'For f***'s sake, Eddie. How do you expect me to sleep?' 'After all the stunts, all the fanfare, I am sat in a chair being beaten by my wife and there is nothing I can do' Eddie Kidd . She continued with 'a barrage of abuse and swearing' before launching a quick succession of half a dozen blows to his face and head, the court was told. On another occasion, she was said to have kicked Mr Kidd in retaliation after a carer had difficulty helping him out of a car and into a wheelchair. In a separate incident, the court heard she slapped Mr Kidd's face in 'retaliation and frustration' at his hand coming off a rail and coming into contact with her. Traumatic: Former Bond stuntman Mr Kidd (right) was left shaking and 'absolutely hysterical' by his wife (left) District Judge William Ashworth said Mrs Kidd had committed an 'abuse of trust and power'. He added: 'These four assaults on Eddie Kidd represent a pattern of violent behaviour towards your husband which, taken together, are in the highest bracket for sentencing guidelines.’ He added: 'Whatever you felt about his disability, you didn't shy away from raining six punches on him or slapping, kicking and throttling him so much that you had to be pulled off him.' In his prime Mr Kidd was a hugely famous stunt rider. He first stunned spectators in December 1979, when he jumped 80ft across the gap in a derelict railway bridge in Essex on a 400cc Yamaha. Mr Kidd's achievements culminated in 1993 when he jumped the Great Wall of China and beat Robbie Knievel, son of Evel Knievel, to the stunt bike world championship.","Father of three kicked and strangled by former stripper Samantha, 44 .

This is the horrifying injury inflicted on a female civil servant by her ex boyfriend, who forced her to the floor, pushed his thumb in her eye socket and then bit the end of her nose off. A witness to the attack told a court hearing that there was a 'gaping hole where the nose should have been'. Surgeons repaired the nose by grafting skin from the victim's hip on to it. Hull Crown Court heard how Simon Brittle, 45, from Rotherham, launched the savage attack on Heidi Smith, 40, at the Motorcycle Action Group three-day ‘Into The Valley Rally’ at South Dalton, near Beverley on May 4. Horrifying: Heidi Smith, left, was left needing plastic surgery after her ex-boyfriend Simon Brittle, 45, right, bit off the end of her nose . The assault was preceded by a chilling Facebook message sent by Brittle to Ms Smith that read: ‘I am looking forward to f***ing you up.’ Crown barrister Philip Evans said that on the day Brittle became loud and aggressive, threatening to stab one man, and accusing a friend of sleeping with Ms Smith. He then punched and slapped her before twisting her arm, forcing her to the ground and straddling her. ‘He pushed his thumb in her eye socket,’ said Mr Evans. ‘That was painful. She screamed out for help, but other people thought it was a couple in an amorous embrace. But [witness] Sally Pearson heard a chilling scream. Others described it as blood curdling. Sally Pearson took hold of Mr Brittle’s shoulder and shouted at him. ‘The defendant was calm and Sally Pearson said he had a blank expression. She was told to get off. He lowered his head, as if they were going to kiss. Heidi Smith then let out an intense scream.’ Heidi Smith has said that despite surgery she 'doesn't feel like me' anymore and has been left traumatised by the attack . Ms Pearson said: ‘I realised at once her nose was gone. Her nose was missing. There was a gaping bloody hole where her nose should have been.’ Miss Smith, a civil servant for the office of public guardian, was left holding her hands to her face in a pool of blood. She was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary for reconstructive surgery where initial photographs shown to the judge were taken. The operation involved taking skin from Ms Smith’s hip and grafting it onto her nose. Ms Smith and Brittle had been in a turbulent four-month relationship that Smith was too frightened to finish, the court heard. Two days before the rally he had sent her a Facebook message that read: ‘I am looking forward to f***ing you up over the weekend. Take plenty of body guards. Hers [sic] to a happy rally season. You don’t know what I am capable of.’ Giving evidence in court, Ms Smith told the judge: ‘I hate my nose. It is pointy and witchy and it’s a different colour. I am grateful the surgeon did a marvellous job, but I am conscious of it all the time.’ She said: ‘I fear his reprisals. He has never listened to anyone before.’ In a victim impact statement she revealed she feels she will have to move from her home of ten years. She said: ‘I don’t feel like me anymore. I am really embarrassed by this I have had to relive the incident over and over again as work colleagues ask me what happened. I have tried to ignore it, but being my nose I cannot hide it or cover it up. I feel people judge me and think I have done something to deserve it. My family have been affected by this. ‘My mother had to deal with me screaming down the telephone. I cannot imagine having a boyfriend again. I have had interest from some guys, but had to decline them. I think it will be a long time before I can trust a man or be alone with them.’ Four months after the attack, Miss Smith still has problems with her arm movement where Brittle twisted it back. Because her nose is painful when it is cold she fears her hobbies of motorcycling and skiing will be affected. She added: ‘Having heard Brittle was looking for a knife, I feel lucky to be alive. I feel I have to move from the home I have been in for 10 years. This incident has changed my life forever.’ Defence barrister John Thackray said: ‘There is absolutely no excuse for his behaviour. He is disgusted in himself. He was drunk.’ He said his life spiralled down. ‘He has gone from being a loyal partner, a good father and working man. There was a break-down in his relationship. He lost his work, became a carer for his father and suffered from depression,’ added Mr Thackray . Brittle, of Middle Lane, Rotherham, pleaded guilty to a charge of GBH with intent. Sentencing Judge Mark Bury told Brittle: ‘You have pleaded guilty to this serious and bestial offence of grievous bodily harm with intent. On the day you had been drinking. You were loud and aggressive. Before this you threatened to stab someone and smashed two cans of lager together. You put your thumbs into Ms Smith’s eye socket. She was screaming out for assistance, but you did not stop there. ‘You then bit her nose off, completely off at the tip - a totally wicked and horrifying offence. She now says her nose is hideous pointy and witchy. She says not a day goes by when she does not think about it. She says her life has been changed and will never get back to the way it was. 'She was your partner, and a vulnerable victim. You must have realised she was scared. The use of your teeth was plainly the use of a weapon. This was not just in public. This was in full view of Heidi Smith’s friends.’ He jailed Brittle for eight years and imposed an indefinite restraining order on contacting Ms Smith. Smith, who left court on the verge of tears, declined to comment on Brittle’s sentence, but praised the Motorcycle Action Group activists and surgeons who could not do enough to help her.","Victim Heidi Smith was warned 'to bring bodyguards to the event'

Nick Clegg issued a blunt warning to David Cameron today that the Tories cannot claim credit for the government’s biggest tax cut. The Lib Dem leader revealed his fury that the Conservatives have produced a poster claiming the ‘tax cut for 25 million’ as their own. Mr Clegg, who earlier showed off his skills playing table tennis, vowed to bat away any attempts by the Tories to steal a policy which they had warned was unaffordable. Backhand: Nick Clegg, who tried his hand at table tennis today, hit back at Tories trying to claim the income tax policy was theirs . Parliamentary ping pong: Mr Clegg played against Greg Robertson, 14, at Scotstoun Sport Centre with members of Dunbarton Table Tennis club . The Lib Dem manifesto promised that ‘you will not have to pay any income tax on the ﬁrst £10,000 you earn’. During the TV leader’s debates before the general election, Mr Cameron told Mr Clegg: ‘I would love to take everyone out of their first £10,000 of income tax, Nick...We cannot afford it.’ But during coalition negotiations, Mr Clegg insisted on the policy being implemented and it will have been delivered in full by next April, making everyone £700 better off. A poster produced for the Conservative party conference later this month lists policies which the party says are ‘for hardworking people’. Alongside reducing the deficit, crime and immigration, it also boasts of ‘a tax cut for 25 million people’. Swipe: This Conservative party poster suggested the tax cut was a Tory policy . Speaking at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow, Mr Clegg told delegates they had to be vigilant to the threat of Tories stealing their policies. He said: ‘I saw on the news this afternoon that the Conservatives, when explaining what their top message is for their conference the week after next, (said) it's raising the income tax allowance,"" said Mr Clegg. ‘That was our manifesto commitment. It was not the Conservatives' commitment. David Cameron told me - and you can look it up on YouTube - in one of the leader's debates in front of millions of people, he said it can't be done. ‘We did it, not them. We did it. We must never, ever, ever allow the great progressive reforms that we are introducing in this Government to be appropriated by others.’ Taking part in a Q&A session, Mr Clegg suggested the Lib Dems will go into the next election promising to protect the NHS and schools budgets from further cuts. The Deputy Prime Minister said retaining the ring-fencing as fresh cuts were made to public spending would be an expression of Liberal Democrat values. The party would suffer at the polls if it was seen to be merely a 'passive recipient' of tough Tory fiscal discipline. Anger: Mr Clegg told delegates at the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow that they had to protect their policies from being stolen . Mr Clegg said he had fought after the last election for schools budgets to be given the same protection as the health service. 'We have done that between 2010 and 2015,"" he said. 'My personal view, and we will have to discuss it, but my personal view is we should do that again for 2015 to 2020. 'And make sure that one of the bedrocks of our approach, our Liberal Democrat approach, is that as we continue to make savings, as we clear the decks up to 2018, we do not make savings in the schools budget and the NHS budget - which I do not think is consistent with our views.' It is also increasingly likely that the Lib Dems would insist in any future coalition that a mansion tax would be introduced to ensure that anyone on the minimum wage paid no income tax.","Tories release poster listing Lib Dem tax cut as a Conservative policy .

David Cameron suffered a double blow yesterday with two new polls showing he is haemorrhaging support in marginal seats and among women voters. One survey found that Labour’s lead is widening in the 40 seats Mr Cameron must win because Tory voters are defecting to Ukip. In 32 seats where Labour is challenging the Conservatives, Ed Miliband’s lead has grown from 9 to 14 points over the last two years. That would put Labour on course for a majority of 60 in 2015, suggests the survey by former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft. A separate survey commissioned by the Mumsnet website suggests Labour is now 13 points ahead because women see Mr Cameron as too posh and ‘out of touch’. The poll, carried out by Ipsos Mori, found that 42 per cent of women would back Labour, compared with 29 per cent who would vote Tory. Among women aged 18-34 the gap widens to a 25-point Labour lead. Justine Roberts, chief executive of Mumsnet, said: ‘On the key issues of the economy and employment and particularly where the cuts have fallen, women feel like there is a lack of someone looking out for their interests. ‘One bit of the narrative [about Cameron] that stands up is this elitist Oxbridge-Eton man who doesn’t quite get women.’ Labour is even ahead even among professional women who traditionally back the Conservatives. In the 32 where Labour was second in 2010, there has been an 8.5 per cent swing from the Tories to Labour. That is enough for Labour to win all 32 seats and another 66 similar constituencies that Lord Ashcroft did not survey. Way with the ladies: Ed Miliband, pictured kissing wife Justine Thornton, is doing significantly better both in general polls and with women voters . Crucially, the poll reveals that since 2011, Labour has lost support in the marginal seats, but is benefiting from Tory defections to Ukip. Labour’s support has dropped 1 per cent over the last two years from 44 to 43 per cent, but Tory support has dropped six points from 35 per cent to 29 per cent and Ukip is now on 11 per cent. Lord Ashcroft said the Tories faced a ‘formidable’ challenge. ‘The tripling of Ukip’s vote share in marginal seats since 2010 threatens to put Ed Miliband in Downing Street in spite of Labour’s lukewarm appeal, ‘ he said. The results fuelled demands by some Tory MPs for the party to strike a general election pact with Ukip before the polls in 2015. One Tory MP said: ‘The doom and gloom has been replaced with complacency in recent weeks. ‘This should make Downing Street focus again.’ Yvette Cooper, the shadow minister for women, said David Cameron had a ‘blind spot’ with women. ‘Under this government, we have a cost of living crisis that is hitting women hardest – yet David Cameron and Nick Clegg don’t even seem to notice or care. These figures show women are fed up with how out of touch the Government is with their lives.’","Poll shows Conservative Party voters are defecting to UKIP .

Transport Minister Norman Baker said drivers should be hit with big increases in parking charges . Cars should be banished from town centres, a Liberal Democrat minister has claimed. Transport Minister Norman Baker said drivers should be hit with big increases in parking charges so they are ‘disincentivised’ from parking near high street shops. He renewed the Lib Dems’ war on motorists at a fringe meeting at his party’s conference in Glasgow. Mr Baker admitted that higher parking charges could ‘damage town centres’ but he then claimed that pushing people onto public transport and bicycles would help revive the high street. He told the meeting hosted by the CentreForum think tank: ‘I was in Southern Germany for a holiday a few years ago. 'I forget which town it was, but there were no cars in the centre at all. ‘The place was heaving with people spending money - and every single shop was occupied.’ Asked if that was his aspiration, he replied: ‘I think that can work.’ Mr Baker said he wants the government to give more cash to cycling schemes and public transport. ‘That works,’ he said. ‘Filling towns and cities with cars can’t work.’ Signalling that he would like to see swingeing rises in parking fees, Mr Baker added: ‘If we are doing everything to make sure towns are attractive for bikes and public transport, it’s right to say that cars should be disincentivised.’ Senior Tories made clear that Mr Baker has been agitating in government to ramp up parking charges but has been blocked by Conservative Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin. A senior government source said: ‘Norman has been pushing for higher parking charges for some time. Mr Baker said he wants the government to give more cash to cycling schemes and public transport . 'It has been blocked and it’s not going to happen under this government. We don’t want to get rid of cars from town centres.’ Tory MP Peter Bone dismissed Mr Baker’s plans as ‘stupid’ and ‘clueless’. He said: ‘In Wellingborough and East Northamptonshire we have kept our car parking free of charge because it has helped our businesses do well. ‘This is just the sort of madcap nonsense we have come to expect from the Liberal Democrats. 'I would congratulate Norman Baker on speaking his mind because it proves what stupid things his party says. ‘It must be very frustrating for sensible ministers to have to work with people who come up with completely clueless proposals like this.’ Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'Drivers will be flabbergasted. 'Parking charges already generate more than half a billion pounds of profit for English councils each year and now a minister is calling for them to be increased further to force motorists away from the High Street. 'Yet only last month ago Eric Pickles was calling for more town centre parking.

A Tory MP was under fire today after claiming Lib Dem Sarah Teather was a poor families minister because she did not ‘produce’ a child of her own. In remarks which were angrily condemned by the Lib Dems, Tim Loughton said his former colleague had made the Department of Education a ‘family-free zone’. Equalities minister Jo Swinson tore into Mr Loughton, branding him 'shameful, crass and frankly disgusting'. Conservative Mr Loughton, who was fired along with Miss Teather in last year’s reshuffle, tried to shrug the comments off joking ‘what am I being panned for now?’ Condemned: Ex-Tory minister Tim Loughton, who was fired in last year's reshuffle, criticised former Lib Dem minister Sarah Teather for not having a family of her own . Mr Loughton claimed Miss Teather, who is childless, ‘doesn’t really believe in family’. Speaking at a Tory event in Windsor, he said: ‘The person who was actually in charge of family policy amongst the ministerial team at the DfE was Sarah Teather. Which was a bit difficult because she doesn't really believe in family. ‘She certainly didn't produce one of her own. So it became a bit of a family-free zone. I think that is a huge disappointment,’ the father-of-three said, the Telegraph reported. Sarah Teather was Britain’s youngest MP – known as the Baby of the House - when elected in 2003 at the age of 29. But she has admitted a hectic schedule of debates in parliament and constituency surgeries gave her ‘no time’ for a love life. Born in June 1974, she attended Leicester Grammar School before pharmacology at Cambridge University. After working as an adviser to Macmillan Cancer Relief, she became a councillor in Islington before entering the Commons defeating Labour in a by-election in Brent. Speaking in 2004, she admitted that the pressure of being an MP took its toll on her social life. ‘It's very hard to meet up with friends,’ she told the BBC. ‘I'm trying to make an effort to routinely book people in, but I have to diarise it with them, because if I don't, it doesn't happen.’ Asked if lifestyle had put paid to thoughts of a boyfriend, she replied. ‘No time. Not currently.’ A staunch Catholic, she voted against the coalition’s plans for same sex marriage, to to anger of many fellow Lib Dems. The extraordinary remarks were immediately condemned by the Lib Dems. Liberal . Democrat equalities minister Miss Swinson said: 'Tim Loughton is . talking absolute rubbish. Sarah Teather was a brilliant minister. 'She . was pivotal in ending the disgraceful practice of child detention for . immigration purposes, she successfully won more money for schools to . help the poorest children, and her work to create a better system of . support for children with special educational needs has been widely . praised. 'She has a . ministerial record to be proud of. Using someone's lack of children as . an insult is shameful, crass and, frankly, disgusting. It reflects far . more on him than on Sarah.' A . senior Lib Dem source said: ‘'I know he's angry about being sacked, but . he needs to gather whatever dignity he has left and shut up. ‘Being a father appears not to have improved his own abilities as a minister, or a human being.’ The staunch defence of Miss Teather, 39, came after she criticised Nick Clegg’s leadership, announcing she was quitting as an MP after feeling ‘desolute’ at government policy on immigration and welfare. As the row erupted, Mr Loughton insisted he was referring to Miss Teather’s failure to produce a family policy. Writing . on Twitter, he added: ‘Hold on-if some journo distorting my comments on . LDem family policy in2 personal attack on Sarah Teather v sorry but not . intended & not fair. ‘Blimey-what . am I being panned for now? My criticism was lack of LibDem family . policy not of Sarah Teather personally who I always respected.’ Speaking . at the Conservative Renewal conference at the weekend, Mr Loughton . blamed the ‘herd instinct’ of rioters in 2011 on the number of children . borne out of wedlock. ‘Many . hard working traditional families have been facing some pretty tough . economic times, some pretty tough loss of benefits and tax-breaks at our . hands, and these by and large are our supporters and our people. ‘We have failed them to a large degree,’ he said.

Damning: Vicky Pryce says it is a 'myth' that taxing high value property could be a source of income for the Government . Nick Clegg's plans for a ‘mansion tax’ have been savaged by Vicky Pryce – former wife of disgraced Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne. Ms Pryce says it is a ‘myth’ that taxing homes worth more than £2 million will be a ‘magic source of income’ for the Government. Her intervention comes as Lib Dems this week prepare to reaffirm their support for the tax – which is also backed by Labour – at their annual conference in Glasgow. But Ms Pryce, who will attend the conference, dismisses the whole idea of a mansion tax, which has been blocked by the Conservatives. In an article for today’s Mail on Sunday, she says: ‘It is a tax that is set at an arbitrary level with no  economic justification for that level or the rate imposed – except to raise a certain amount of money’ and ‘a mantra for those who feel there is a hidden reservoir of taxes just waiting to be tapped’. Ms Pryce also pointedly disagrees with her friend Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, who has raised fears that Coalition plans for low-deposit mortgages could lead to a new house price bubble. ‘There are concerns over a housing market bubble – expressed by Vince Cable no less – but I don’t share them,’ she says. The remarks came as Mr Clegg last night opened the Glasgow rally with a plea for party unity. He sought to placate members over sharing power with David Cameron by branding the Tories the ‘fire at will’ party for wanting to cut workers’ rights. But respected Lib Dem peer Tony . Greaves accused Mr Clegg of trying to blackmail his party into sticking . with Tory-inspired austerity measures in a crunch vote tomorrow. The . Deputy Prime Minister will speak in a conference motion on the economy . in a bid to ensure members do not oppose Coalition spending cuts. But . Lord Greaves said: ‘Presumably they were frightened they were going to . lose – but it’s blackmail. It’s turning the debate into a vote of . confidence in the leader.’ Ex-husband: Pryce was married to former British Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne. The two were jailed in March after they falsely told police she had been driving when his car was caught by a speed camera . Unity: Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem Leader Nick Clegg called for party unity at the opening of today's conference . Vince Cable will tomorrow delight activists by vowing to crack down on ‘rotten’ company directors by beefing up the law. The Business Secretary will unveil plans to make it easier to ban rogue directors from running firms. He will also announce help for people to get compensation where they have suffered a financial loss from a director’s ‘reckless’ behaviour. Mr Cable, left, said: ‘For too long, a small rotten core [of directors] has got away with a slap on the wrist, a ban from working in the industry or a time-limited ban. I want to beef up the laws to ban them from running British companies.’","'Myth' that taxing homes worth more than £2m will be a 'magic source of income', Pryce says .

A dog walker sparked a major rescue operation involving more than 20 police officers after shouting out the name of her pet Yelp - which was mistaken for cries of 'help!'. A worried member of the public called police after hearing the muffled shouting coming from near a disused coppermine in woods above the Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire. Police sent a specialist dog handler and a team of officers to investigate while mountain rescue teams were also called in. Search: A team of 20 police officers spent eight-and-a-half hours scouring woodland after a dog walker heard cries of 'help!' - which were actually from a woman shouting for her dog Yelp . Emergency search: Police were told within half an hour that a dog walker had been shouting at her pet in the area - but they carried on searching for a further eight hours anyway . Officers spent eight-and-a-half hours combing a small area of woodland yesterday searching for the 'trapped' woman. But last night they were forced to call off their search after realising the cries were almost certainly a dog walker shouting the name of her pet. Officers arrived on the scene at around 8am yesterday, and 'fairly quickly' established that another woman regularly . exercised her dog in the area. She was contacted at around 8.30 am, and confirmed that she had been in the area, and had indeed been shouting for her pet. However, half an hour later, just as this . was beginning to look like the explanation, police received further . calls from two more people, insisting they had again heard a woman's . voice shouting 'help'. Police eventually abandoned the search shortly after 5pm last night after finding no evidence of an emergency. Hunt: The search went on in in woods above the Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, yesterday . A police spokesman said they were confident they had carefully searched the area, and had done all that could be done. Inspector Pat Scroggie, who led the operation, said the search had been treated as 'precautionary'. He said: 'We had teams search the hills accompanied with search dogs. 'We are very well versed in this type of thing. We are carried out systematic searches of all sections of the hill.' The Bridge of Allan coppermine was used intermittently from the 16th century until the early part of the 20th century. Probe: Three separate members of the public told police they thought they had heard cries of 'help!' yesterday . At one time, copper from the mine was used in the mint at Stirling Castle. No actual shafts exist, because the copper was extracted by drift mining techniques. The area above Mine Woods, Bridge of Allan, was the focus of extensive searches earlier in the year, after Stirling University mathematics student David O'Halloran, 18, went missing in January. His body was found in the spring, in open countryside, not far from the woods. Hamish McArthur, 63, who lives on the hill, said: 'I think perhaps people are more wary now when they hear things after the young student was found in the field not far from here.'","20 police officers, a dog unit and a mountain rescue team launched a major search after a walker heard muffled cries of 'help!'

There was the $700,000 (£440,000) life insurance payout he received after the 2008 death of his grown son, who was crushed when the pickup truck he was working under suddenly slipped off its jack. There was the $200,000 (£125,000) life insurance payout he received when his first wife died in a house fire nearly two decades earlier. And finally for Cindy Karlsen, there was the $1.2 million (£750,000) policy that her husband had now taken out on her life. Suspect: Karl Karlsen arriving for a court appearance at the Seneca County Courthouse in Waterloo, New York, last December . That's what prompted her to work with police, leading to second-degree murder and insurance fraud charges against Karl Karlsen in the death of his 23-year-old son, Levi. And New York and California authorities are now taking a new look at the circumstances of the 1991 death of his former wife, Christina Karlsen. Cindy Karlsen's cooperation evolved from an unnerving revelation a year before she came forward. She learned Karlsen had invested some of the insurance money from his son's death into a life insurance policy on her. ‘I would be worth $1.2 million dead to Karl,’ she testified during a pretrial proceeding. Wire-tapped: Karl Karlsen was recorded by his wife explaining how a truck his son was working on was precariously balanced . After speaking to sheriff's investigators last year, she agreed to wear a wire to secretly record her husband. She made several recordings, the first three using a digital gadget hidden in her bra. The final recording took place in a crowded restaurant in New York's picturesque Finger Lakes region in hopes of getting him to confirm her suspicions about the death of his son. ‘I led him to believe our marriage had a chance if he came clean,’ Cindy Karlsen said in a recent hearing, the husband she is now in the process of divorcing sitting in prison orange just a few feet away. ‘I told him he could trust me.’ The wire picked up Karl Karlsen . telling Cindy how he'd removed his truck's front tires and raised it on a . single jack before asking Levi to repair the brake and transmission . lines. ‘It was so wobbly,’ Karlsen said, according to a recording of the conversation, heard . against the backdrop of restaurant noise, played recently in court. Tell the truth, Cindy Karlsen implored. ‘It was never meant to be,’ he said. ‘It was never planned from Day One to ever go that way.’ A . week later, Karlsen would spend 9 1/2 hours being interrogated by . police. Seventy-five times Karlsen denied killing his son, his lawyer, . Lawrence Kasperek, said. Eventually, he signed a statement acknowledging . he had knocked the truck off its jack and walked away. In . the videotaped interview, Karlsen explained he would never . intentionally have caused the truck to fall. After years of taking pain . medication for various ailments, his mind was fuzzy, he told detectives. ‘In some ways, it's a blank.’ Karlsen . was immediately charged. The 52-year-old has pleaded not guilty to the . second-degree murder charge in advance of his trial scheduled for next . month. If convicted, he could get up to life behind bars. Levi Karlsen, father of two young children, was crushed to death by a pickup truck at his family's farm . Karlsen's . attorney is fighting to keep the statement and the restaurant . conversation with Cindy Karlsen out of trial. District Attorney Barry . Porsch calls them crucial to the case. In . an interview with The Post-Standard of Syracuse a month after his . arrest, Karlsen said his ex-wife's death, his son's death and even a . 2002 fire at his Seneca County farm that killed his Belgian draft . horses, for which he collected $80,000 (£50,000) in insurance money, . were all just coincidences. But . Art Alexander, Christina Karlsen's father, told The Associated Press . from his Murphys, California, home that he didn't think bad luck had . anything to do with it. ‘I . think it's a very greedy man with a very cold heart,’ said Alexander, . who has long suspected that his son-in-law and former business partner . was responsible for his 30-year-old daughter's death. Karl Karlsen has been charged with murdering his son and will be reinvestigated for a fire that killed his first wife. He collected insurance payouts on both occasions . The family farm in upstate New York where Levi Karlsen died. Karl Karlsen bought the property with insurance money paid out from a suspicious fire that killed his first wife . Christina, . Alexander was told, was trapped in the bathroom after spilled kerosene . was ignited by a faulty electric light. Although Karl Karlsen is . credited with getting Levi and their other two children out safely, . Christina was unable to escape through the bathroom window because . Karlsen had boarded it up from the outside days before, saying it was . broken. ‘Seventeen nails were in that board,’ Alexander, 73, recalls. The . insurance policy, he said, had been taken out just before Christmas. The fire happened New Year's Day. Karlsen's abrupt move to New York and . away from scrutiny further stoked the father's suspicions. Even . so, Alexander was surprised to hear of Karlsen's arrest in his son's . death, and relieved to learn the 1991 fire was getting a second look.

Giant pandas could advance the development of biofuels thanks to microbes found in their faeces. A pair of pandas at Memphis Zoo are contributing their waste in the name of scientific research, which aims to develop biofuels of the future. The pandas' contribution could be added to by others from Toronto Zoo as scientists endeavour to shift biofuel production away from corn and other crops that are grown to be eaten and to non-food plant material instead. A pair of Pandas at Memphis Zoo (pictured) are contributing their waste in the name of scientific research, which aims to develop superior biofuels of the future. Ya Ya and Le Le's faeces could help scientists work out how to shift biofuel production away from corn and other crops grown to be eaten . Ashli Brown, of Mississippi State University, who is leading the research told the 246th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society, said that the pandas are giving their faeces to the study. 'We have discovered microbes in panda feces might actually be a solution to the search for sustainable new sources of energy,' she said. 'It's amazing that here we have an endangered species that's almost gone from the planet, yet there's still so much we have yet to learn from it. That underscores the importance of saving endangered and threatened animals.' She has identified more than 40 microbes living in the guts of giant pandas at the Memphis Zoo that could make biofuel production from plant waste easier and cheaper. The research, Professor Brown added, also may provide important new information for keeping giant pandas healthy. Ethanol made from corn is the most common alternative fuel in the U.S. but many fear that wide use of corn, soybeans and other food crops used for fuel production may raise food prices or lead to shortages of food. Professor Brown pointed out that corn stalks, corn cobs and other plant material not used for food production would be better sources of ethanol. Scientists are keen on developing biofuels from non-food plants but tough stalks can be expensive to process. Professor Brown is examining bacteria that are highly efficient in breaking down lignocellulose and freeing up the material that can be fermented into ethanol and used in biofuels . However, that currently requires special processing to break down the tough lignocellulose material in plant waste and other crops, such as switchgrass, grown specifically for ethanol production. Breaking down this material is costly and requires a pretreatment step using heat and high pressure or acids. She and other scientists are looking for bacteria that are highly efficient in breaking down lignocellulose and freeing up the material that can be fermented into ethanol. Bacteria in giant panda digestive tracts are prime candidates. Not only do pandas digest a diet of bamboo, but they have a short digestive tract that requires bacteria with unusually potent enzymes for breaking down lignocellulose. Professor Brown explained: 'The time from eating to defecation is comparatively short in the panda, so their microbes have to be very efficient to get nutritional value out of the bamboo. 'And efficiency is key when it comes to biofuel production — that's why we focused on the microbes in the giant panda.' Working with scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, her team identified bacteria that break down lignocellulose into simple sugars, which can be fermented into bioethanol. As well as helping to advance biofuels, Professor Brown said understanding the relationships between the microbes and the pandas is important for the endangered animals' conservation. There are plans to expand the work to include samples from red pandas (pictured) at the Memphis Zoo, which also eat bamboo . They also found bacteria that can take those sugars and transform them into oils and fats for biodiesel production. Professor Brown said either the bacteria themselves or the enzymes in them that actually do the work could be part of the industrial process. 'These studies also help us learn more about this endangered animal's digestive system and the microbes that live in it, which is important because most of the diseases pandas get affect their guts,' she said. 'Understanding the relationships between the microbes and the pandas, as well as how they get their energy and nutrition, is extremely important from a conservation standpoint, as fewer than 2,500 giant pandas are left in the wild and only 200 are in captivity.' Additional plans include expanding the work to include samples from red pandas at the Memphis Zoo, which also eat bamboo.","Pandas from Memphis Zoo are are contributing their waste in the name of scientific research, which aims to develop biofuels of the future .

The computer searches of a 12-year-old girl who killed herself after being cyberbullied for two years has revealed that she was looking for ways to commit suicide. After Rebecca Sedwick's suicide, police looked at her computer and found search queries such as 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' and various ways to kill herself. One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track. Missed: Rebecca Sedwick died earlier this week after years of online bullying . She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.' And then, on Monday, she went to an abandoned concrete plant in Lakeland where she liked to hang out, climbed a tower and hurled herself to her death. Her body was found on Tuesday and now police are investigating as many as 15 girls to see who contributed to driving Rebecca to suicide. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls. 'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said. 'She appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigating is exceptionally disturbing.'

Last December, Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff.

Apple's shares fell more than 5 per cent on Wednesday, following the launch of its new iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. The share price ended at a . one-month low of $467.24 at midday after at least three brokerages . downgraded the stock. It is thought that investors were put off by the price of the handsets, especially the so-called 'cheap' iPhone 5C which starts at £469, claiming they weren't low enough for Apple to attract new customers, especially in emerging markets such as China. Apple's shares fell 5.4 per cent on Wednesday, following the launch of its new iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. The price ended at $467.24 before rising marginally to $467.71. Investors were put off by the £469 price of the iPhone 5C claiming it wasn't low enough for Apple to attract new customers . At an event in Cupertino on Wednesday morning, Apple's CEO Tim Cook and senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller unveiled two new handsets. The iPhone 5S is a high-end successor to the current iPhone 5 model and comes in gold, silver and slate, with a fingerprint scanner built into the 'home' button and starts at £549. The iPhone 5C, which before the event was rumoured to be Apple's first 'budget' handset, comes in a range of five colours and has the same screen and camera as the current iPhone 5 model. Cook also announced at the event that the firm would be discontinuing the iPhone 5 after the new handsets go on sale on 20 September. Rumours had suggested that the price of the bargain phone would be around £63, yet the handset price starts at £469, which industry experts claimed was still too expensive for low-end customers. Analysts also accused Apple of misleading customers by showing the handset costing $99 during the event, yet that price was on a two-year contract and monthly payments weren't announced. Around a third of the world's handsets are sold in China to half a billion people, yet only 12 per cent of these phones are made by Apple. Korean rivals Samsung is the leading smartphone manufacturer in the region, with Chinese brands including Huawei and Lenovo also popular. Apple is still a popular choice in China, but predominantly with the Chinese elite, and Carl Howe, vice president of Yankee Group's Consumer Research group told ABC News: 'Rumor has [Apple] that they make more money in any of the five stores in China than they do in the Fifth Avenue store in New York.' Apple phones in China cost around the same amount as the average person's monthly salary in urban areas, or three months wages for a bus driver, for example. The 5S is due to sell in China for 5,288 yuan (£547) and the 5C for 4,488 yuan (£464) and the handsets, which will be available from 20 September, will be launched in China at the same time as other major territories for the first time ever. Howe continued that although China is Apple's second largest market, there is a large percentage of the population that it is not able to attract. The phrase 'iPhone 5S' was the most popular search term on Sina Weibo, China's most widely used social network, on Wednesday, while 'iPhone 5C' didn't appear on the top searches list. Users questioned why anyone willing to fork out well over 4,000 yuan for a smartphone would not just pay a bit more for the premium 5S model. Apple's share of the China smartphone market slipped to five per cent in the second quarter, according to research firm Canalys, behind not just Samsung but also Lenovo, ZTE, Huawei and Xiaomi Technology. 'Even though Apple has a lower end iPhone now, its price is still considered mid-end in China and not low-end,' said Sandy Shen, a Shanghai-based analyst for Gartner. Around half of China's smartphone shipments are in the 700-1,500 yuan range, said Shen, but competing on those prices isn't an attractive prospect for Apple. 'Considering Apple's old rival Samsung and domestic players such as Huawei, Lenovo and Coolpad all have phones in that category, Apple will still lose out in market share in these key segments,' she said. No UK network operators have released contract pricing yet. 'Investors were put off that Apple's . price point didn't go low enough to attract a new market. It doesn't . have the same range in price that Apple's competitors have,' said Mark . Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in . Philadelphia. 'It doesn't have the same range in price that Apple's competitors have,' he added. 'We believe Apple is foregoing a valuable and relatively easy way to return to earnings growth.' Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, unveiled the iPhone 5C on Tuesday. In the U.S the device starts at $99 on a two-year contract yet experts have called this misleading because monthly costs weren't announced. When bought outright, the handset is $549, or £469 in the UK . Apple recently lost smartphone market share to main rival Samsung, dropping to 14 per cent - its lowest for three years - because of ‘lacklustre’ iPhone 5 sales and tougher competition from rivals. Analysts predicted that Apple would be looking to boost sales in emerging markets, such as China, and this was bolstered by the fact Apple held a mirror event in Beijing, and announced the iPhone 5S will also be made available in China at the same time as other countries for the first time ever. Rivals including Samsung and Huawei do well in emerging economies because their handsets are cheaper to produce, so cost less. To put this into perspective, the 5C will sell for 4,488 yuan (£464) in China, which is more than the average monthly urban income for the country.

Analysts predicted Apple would be looking to boost sales in emerging markets, such as China to rival Samsung and Huawei, yet the 5C will sell for 4,488 yuan (£464), which is more than the average monthly urban income for the country . If the drop in Apple's share price was to hold or remain low, the fall would be biggest single-day slide since 24 January. Still, . Apple's shares climbed 28 per cent between the start of July and Monday ahead of the launch as anticipation began building about the . company's next iPhone. Despite many investors being critical of the announcement, four others raised their target prices. Nomura Equity Research increased its target to $480 from $420, for example. Reaction among industry experts and consumers was mixed. Apple's profit for the quarter which ended on 29 June, fell 22 per cent as gross margins fell below 37 per cent from more than 42 per cent in the year-earlier quarter. UBS, which cut its rating on Apple's stock to 'neutral' from 'buy,' cited a survey of 35,000 Chinese consumers conducted by ChinaDaily.com that found only 2.6 per cent of respondents would consider buying the cheaper iPhone 5C. 'We worry that Apple's inability/unwillingness to come out with a low-priced offering for emerging markets nearly ensures that the company will continue to be an overall share loser in the smartphone market until it chooses to address the low end,' Sanford C. Bernstein analysts said in a note. MailOnline's Mark Prigg was given hands-on time with Apple's new iPhone 5S following Wednesday's launch: . 'Apple's iPhone 5S is without doubt an evolution rather than a revolution. 'Despite . this, the 5S is the best looking phone on the market, and the new . champagne cover is surprisingly nice - and thankfully not as bling as it . looks in some pictures.

An accidental discovery has led to the creation of the world’s thinnest sheet of glass - at just one molecule thick. The ‘pane’ of glass is so impossibly thin that its individual silicon and oxygen atoms are clearly visible using a microscope. The discovery may someday lead to a defect-free, ultra-thin material that could improve the performance of processors in computers and smartphones. Professor David Muller (right) and graduate student Pinshane Huang (left) are holding a structural model of the world's thinnest pane of glass, which is actually a 100 million times thinner in real life . The glass was identified by chance in the lab of David Muller, professor of applied and engineering physics at Cornell University. Professor Muller had been making graphene, a two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms, in a chicken wire crystal formation. He noticed some ‘muck’ on the graphene, and when he took a closer look, found it to be made up of the elements of everyday glass; silicon and oxygen. ‘When the first images came up on the computer screen we were just blown away,’ he told MailOnline. A picture of the atoms in the glass taken with our electron microscope, which is one of the most powerful in the world. The brightest dots are silicon . Glass has always been a mystery. The problem, for years, was that scientists had no way to directly . see it and so struggled to understand it. It behaves like a solid, but was . thought to look more like a liquid. In 1932 William Zachariasen published 'The Atomic Arrangement in Glass'- an article that is seen as the influential piece on the science of glass. In it, he drew a diagram of what he thought would be the correct theoretical representation of the arrangement of atoms in glass. The most recent work at Cornell University, proves that Mr Zachariase's theory was in fact correct. ‘The mystery atoms were the elements of everyday glass, silicon and oxygen. ‘But more amazing, their arrangement looked exactly like the cartoons proposed 81 years ago as to how atoms in a glass might be arranged so that it would be stable. ‘And here, for the first time, we were actually seeing that.’ It took the research team another year to understand how the glass might have grown. They concluded that an air leak had caused the copper to react with the quartz, also made of silicon and oxygen. This produced the glass layer on the would-be pure graphene. The work answers an 81-year-old question about the structure of glass. The image shows the atoms in the glass overlayed by a cartoon based on the model proposed in 1932 by William Houlder Zachariasen. The red dots are oxygen and the yellow dots are silicon atoms . Scientists, with no way to directly see it, had struggled to understand it: it behaves like a solid, but was thought to look more like a liquid. But what Cornell University found strikingly resembles a diagram drawn in 1932 by William Zachariasen – a longstanding theoretical representation of the arrangement of atoms in glass. ‘This is the work that, when I look back at my career, I will be most proud of,’ said Muller. ‘It's the first time that anyone has been able to see the arrangement of atoms in a glass.’ The discovery was made as part of a collaboration between Cornell University and the University of Ulm, and is now recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records.","David Muller made the finding after noticing some 'muck' on graphene .

Environmental health chiefs have recalled frozen lamb, beef and mutton trim supplied by a farm raided by police during the horsemeat scandal. The Food Standards Agency said that the meat products, supplied by the company formerly trading as Farmbox Meats in Aberyswyth, are believed not to have been subject to 'proper temperature controls'. The FSA said that all products of all dates and batch codes are subject to the recall as they do not comply with 'traceability requirements'. Recall: Beef trim from Farmbox Meats in Wales has been recalled after it is believed it didn't meat Food Standards Agency regulations (file picture) Farmbox Meats, based in Llandre, was raided by police and FSA officers back in February as part of the investigation into the horsemeat scandal. Production at the plant was suspended for a month as part of the inquiry into alleged mislabelling of foods. At the time, company owner Dafydd Raw-Rees insisted that there had been no cross contamination of meats. But burgers made by the award-winning Burger Manufacturing Company (BMC) in Builth Wells were reported to have been found with traces of British horsemeat in them and were said to have been served up at local schools and hosptitals. Allegations: Farmbox Meats was raided by the FSA and police after burgers made from meat it supplied were alleged to contain horsemeat . The company claimed that the meat used to make the burgers was bought from Farmbox Meats. Farmbox was allowed to re-open again the following month. There is no indication that today's recall is connected with the horsemeat scandal. 'Hygiene issues' meant that production at the plant was stopped again in April, allegations that were disputed by the firm's lawyers. Mr Raw-Rees threatened to take legal action against the FSA but the firm went into receivership back in June and is no longer trading. An FSA spokesman told MailOnline that the the recall is as a result of ongoing investigations surrounding Farmbox. The spokesman said that inadequate records held by the company means that officials cannot identify where meat was sent to from the site, so it has issued a recall in case any food manufacturers are still in possession of the meat.","Food Standards Agency recalls lamb, beef and mutton trim from farm .

The creators of Grand Theft Auto V have launched an investigation after copies of the eagerly-anticipated video game appear to have been dispatched days ahead of its official release. Online retailer Amazon has already sold out of the game which cost more to make than many Hollywood blockbusters and, in certain circles, generated a similar hype. Hundreds of fans are expected to queue up tonight to get their hands on the latest iteration in the Grand Theft Auto series which reportedly cost around £170 million to make and market - more than films such as Avatar. Scroll down for trailer.. The creators of Grand Theft Auto V have launched an investigation after copies of the eagerly-anticipated video game appear to have been dispatched days ahead of its official release . It will go on sale at midnight when stores across the country are expected to open their doors for special launch events. But some gamers claimed to have received their copies as early as Friday following Amazon deliveries. One fan took to Twitter to say: ‘I refuse to disclose whether Amazon has dispatched my pre-order copy of GTA early in case it prevents them from doing so again in the future. GTA maker Rockstar said it was looking into how any copies of the game may have been released early. The game will go on sale at midnight when stores are expected to open their doors for the launch event . ‘We are in the process of investigating early “sales” to determine how and why that is occurring,’ a spokesman told the Games Industry International website. In a message on its website, Amazon warned any orders placed after September 13 may not arrive until after tomorrow’s release date because of high demand. It said: ‘Grand Theft Auto V (Xbox 360)--Stock Update. Please note--due to high demand, orders placed for Grand Theft Auto V (Xbox 360) from September 13 will be shipped as soon as we receive inventory.’ Experts are tipping the game to smash sales records and estimates suggest it could generate £1 billion during its first year on sale when gamers are predicted to snap up some 25 million copies. Tom Butler, social media editor of gaming site IGN.com, said thousands of workers have taken the day off for the launch or plan on calling in sick. ‘Grand Theft Auto V will be the biggest entertainment launch of the year and possibly all-time with levels of consumer anticipation outstripping Harry Potter and Twilight,’ he said. Some gamers took to Twitter to say they received their copies as early as Friday following Amazon deliveries . According to its findings, around 46 per cent of people to buy the game said they booked Tuesday off as holiday . ‘With gamers queuing at midnight to be among the first to play and the developer boasting thousands of hours of game play, there’s no surprise that we’re likely to see an outbreak of GTA flu this September.’ The gaming site polled 10,995 readers to ask whether they would take time off work on Tuesday when the GTA V goes on sale. According to its findings, 5,059 readers- around 46 per cent- said they booked the day off as holiday. Another 2,012 (19 per cent) said they would phone in claiming to be unwell while 35 per cent said they would wait to get their hands on the game. The Grand Theft Auto series - which sees players buy virtual prostitutes - has accumulated sales of 135 million copies since its 1997 debut. ‘Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America,’ said Keza MacDonald, games editor at IGN.com. ‘It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It’s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. ‘No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem.’","Game is due for release at midnight with hundreds expected to que early .

Scottish scientists have developed synthetic speech to make it easier for people to hear public announcements in crowded, noisy places like railway stations . Everyone has been stuck in an airport or train station terminal listening out for critical announcements, only to find it is almost impossible to understand the booming voice that erupts from the public address system. But these annoying messages could become a thing of the past as Scottish scientists have developed synthetic speech to make it easier for people to hear public announcements in crowded, noisy places. Researchers have come up with a system that they claim make announcements quieter and clearer by creating software that can alter speech before it is broadcast over speakers. The study, led by the University of Edinburgh, looked into how speech is heard by listeners to improve upon the synthetic voice technology currently used. Dr Cassia Valentini Botinhao, from the university's School of Informatics, said: 'Noisy environments make it difficult to . understand what is being said and simply making speech louder isn’t the . smartest solution.' 'Our findings could offer an alternative, by making speech more intelligible without turning up the volume.' Researchers carried out tests to pinpoint the components of speech that are most easily heard by people in a noisy place. They found that in loud environments, listeners pay most attention to the parts of speech that are the clearest and easiest to hear, in order to fill in the gaps and decipher the whole content of a message. Dr Cassia Valentini Botinhao, said: 'Noisy environments make it difficult to understand what is being said and simply making speech louder isn't the smartest solution. Our findings could offer an alternative, by making speech more intelligible without turning up the volume' The scientists developed a mathematical computer program to analyse spoken word and enhance and clarify sounds that listeners pick up on the most, in a bid to make messages easier to understand overall. Testing the system, they discovered that listeners found the manipulated speech easier to understand than natural speech and in some cases the improvement was equivalent to lowering noise volume by five decibels. The scientists believe the research could also be used to improve smartphone voices and announcements on sat nav systems. The study was carried out with scientists from Greece, Spain and Sweden and the findings presented at the Interspeech conference in Lyon.

While the party’s own surveys show just 10 per cent of voters will back the Lib Dems in the 2015 election, only another 15 per cent would even consider backing them. ‘That’s our market and we are concentrating on them,’ a senior figure said. On the rocks? Nick Clegg is expected to distance himself from David Cameron at the Lib Dem party conference . The dire prognosis comes as a Lib Dem minister today warns that the party is courting electoral disaster by disowning Government policies.

The space agency said it has found three suitable asteroids, one of which it hopes it can put into lunar orbit using a robotic space lasso. Once in orbit, astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021. The space agency said it has identified three asteroids, one of which it hopes it can put into lunar orbit using a robotic space lasso. This artist's rendering shows what capturing an asteroid could look like . The asteroids are all between seven and 10m in size, but further tests will need to be conducted to determine their suitability, said scientists at a conference in San Diego, California. ‘We have two to three which we will characterise in the next year and if all goes well... those will be valid candidates that could be certified targets,’ said Paul Chodas, senior scientist at the Nasa Near-Earth Object Program Office. The mission hopes to gather useful information that will help protect the Earth from a potential hazardous asteroid collision, as well as the technology to enable for future human missions to deep space. Once in orbit, astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021 . NASA would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide. They would then tow or push it towards Earth so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon. In . 2021 astronauts would then use an Orion capsule - a manned spacecraft - . to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for . analysis. This asteroid would also, probably in the 2030s, be used as a stop-off point for astronauts on their way to Mars. Last month, the latest version of the plan was revealed in an animation. Exact details on how Nasa plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known, but the rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag. The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle. Though it bares a striking resemblance to the earlier Apollo Spacecraft, Orion can hold more crew and is far-more advanced, said Nasa. Up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid, compared to the maximum three in Apollo, in a trip that utilises both solar power and the Moon’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft, according to the video. After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object . Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows. After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loop around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video. The project, which envisions that astronauts could visit such an asteroid as early as 2021, is included in President Obama's £11.5 billion spending plan for the U.S. space agency for the 2014 tax year. It is intended as an expansion of existing initiatives to find asteroids that may be on a collision course with Earth, and as part of preparations for a human expedition to Mars in the 2030s. ‘This mission allows us to better develop our technology and systems to explore farther than we've ever been before - to an asteroid and to Mars - places that humanity has dreamed about … but has had no hope of ever attaining,’ Nasa administrator Charles Bolden said. Using a combination of solar power and gravity-aided thrust, the Orion will make the 10 day trip to the asteroid . ‘We're on the threshold of being able to tell my kids and my grandkids that we're almost there.’ Interest in potentially threatening asteroids sky-rocketed after a small asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia on February 15, shattering windows and damaging buildings. About 1,500 people were injured by flying glass and debris. The same day another larger asteroid passed about 17,200 miles from Earth - closer than the television and communication satellites that ring the planet. The incidents had created an imperative ‘to develop techniques and technology that will help deter or to keep an asteroid or other type of body from impacting Earth,’ Mr Bolden said. ‘One of the serendipitous results from this [asteroid-retrieval] flight we hope will be the demonstration of a capability to move an asteroid, to deflect it ever so slightly.’ Mr Obama is also requesting £535 million to support efforts to develop commercial space taxis in hopes of breaking Russia's monopoly on crew transportation to the space station by 2017.","Nasa plans to send a 7-10m asteroid into lunar orbit within the next decade .

The rising tones NASA observed are made by the vibration of dense plasma or ionised gas and were captured by the probe's plasma wave instrument. Speaking in a news conference, Don Gurnett, principle investigator for the Voyager plasma wave investigation, said: 'When you hear this recording, please recognise that this is an historic event. It's the first time that we've ever made a recording of sounds in interstellar space.' Scroll down for video . Somewhere out there: Voyager 1 spacecraft barreling through space. The space agency announced today that Voyager 1 has become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space, or the space between stars . Voyager 1's current mission, along with Voyager 2, is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond . NASA officials added: 'There were two times the instrument heard these vibrations: October to November 2012 and April to May 2013. 'Scientists noticed that each occurrence involved a rising tone. The dashed line indicates that the rising tones follow the same slope. This means a continuously increasing density.' A team still stays in contact with the two Voyager spacecraft every day but Voyager 1's extreme distance, currently around 12 billion miles from Earth, means a message takes 17 hours to reach us. Thirty-six years after it was . launched from Earth on a tour of the outer planets, the . plutonium-powered probe is more than 11 1/2 billion miles from the sun, . cruising through what scientists call interstellar space — the vast, . cold emptiness between the stars, the space agency said. Voyager 1 actually made its exit more . than a year ago, according to NASA. But it's not as if there's a dotted . boundary line out there or a signpost, and it was not until recently . that the space agency had the evidence to convince it of what an outside . research team had claimed last month: that the spacecraft had finally . plowed through the hot plasma bubble surrounding the planets and escaped . the sun's influence. While some scientists said they remain unconvinced, NASA celebrated. 'It's a milestone and the beginning . of a new journey,' said mission chief scientist Ed Stone at NASA's Jet . Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. Voyager 1 will now study exotic . particles and other phenomena in a never-before-explored part of the . universe and radio the data back to Earth, where the Voyager team awaits . the starship's discoveries. The interstellar ambassador also . carries a gold-plated disc containing multicultural greetings, songs and . photos, just in case it bumps into an intelligent species. This artist's concept shows NASA's two Voyager spacecraft exploring a turbulent region of space known as the heliosheath, the outer shell of the bubble of charged particles around our sun . It is 36 years since the twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where . nothing from Earth has flown before. Their primary mission was the exploration of Jupiter and Saturn. After . making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on . Jupiter's moon Io and intricacies of Saturn's rings -- the mission was . extended. Voyager 2 went on to explore Uranus and Neptune, and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets. The . current mission for both spacecraft, the Voyager Interstellar Mission, . is to explore the outermost edge of the Sun's domain and beyond. Voyager 1's odyssey began in 1977 . when the spacecraft and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched on a tour of . the gas giant planets of the solar system. After beaming back dazzling . postcard views of Jupiter's giant red spot and Saturn's shimmering . rings, Voyager 2 hopscotched to Uranus and Neptune. Meanwhile, Voyager 1 . used Saturn as a gravitational slingshot to power itself past Pluto. Voyager 1, which is about the size of . a subcompact car, carries instruments that study magnetic fields, . cosmic rays and solar wind. Last year, scientists monitoring . Voyager 1 noticed strange happenings that suggested the spacecraft had . broken through: Charged particles streaming from the sun suddenly . vanished. At the same time, there was a spike in galactic cosmic rays . bursting in from the outside. Since there was no detectable change . in the direction of the magnetic field lines, the team assumed the . far-flung craft was still in the heliosphere, or the vast bubble of . charged particles around the sun . Voyager is bathed in solar wind from the southern hemisphere flowing northward . The Voyager team patiently waited for . a change in magnetic field direction — thought to be the telltale sign . of a cosmic border crossing. But in the meantime, a chance solar . eruption caused the space around Voyager 1 to echo like a bell last . spring and provided the scientists with the data they needed, convincing . them the boundary had been crossed in August of last year. 'It took us 10 seconds to realize we . were in interstellar space,' said Don Gurnett, a Voyager scientist at . the University of Iowa who led the new research, published online in the . journal Science. The new observations are fascinating, . but 'it's premature to judge,' said Lennard Fisk, a space science . professor at the University of Michigan and former NASA associate . administrator who was not part of the team. 'Can we wait a little while . longer? Maybe this picture will clear up the farther we go.' Voyager 1 is capable of returning scientific data from a full range of instruments, with adequate electrical power and attitude control propellant to keep operating until 2020. What bothers Fisk is the absence of a change in magnetic field direction. Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan . McDowell was more blunt: 'I'm actually not going to believe it for . another year or two until it's been solidly outside for a while.' While Voyager 1 may have left the . solar system as most people understand it, it still has thousands of . years to go before bidding adieu to the last icy bodies that make up our . neighborhood. Voyager 2 trails behind at 9 1/2 . billion miles from the sun. It may take another three years before . Voyager 2 joins its twin on the other side. Eventually, the Voyagers . will run out of nuclear fuel and will have to power down their . instruments, perhaps by 2025.

Schiller reassured users that Touch ID is secure by explaining that 'all fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip' adding the prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud. Yet security researchers aren't convinced. John Hawes from Sophos Security wrote: In the past, [fingerprint scanners] have proven rather unreliable, plagued with security worries. The iPhone 5S scanner works by using a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger. It then uses a 'laser cut sapphire crystal' to take a high-res image scan and the Touch ID software in iOS 7 determines whether the print belongs to the owner or not . Apple's Phil Schiller, pictured, explained the scanner was secure because prints are saved to the chip, and not online. Yet security researchers are concerned that prints can be stolen from anywhere . 'Fingerprints are not secret: we leave copies of them wherever we go. Once someone devious has got hold of a copy, sensors can be fooled.' He continues that, unlike passwords, if fingerprint information is stolen it can't be changed. Marc Rogers, principal security researcher at Lookout agreed: 'PIN codes can be inconvenient meaning so many users fail to enable them altogether. 'In this case, fingerprint scanning is better than nothing at all, but it provides little added security over a four-digit code. 'Because fingerprints can be lifted and duplicated, they should not be used as the sole credential.' Speaking at a TechCrunch Disrupt event, Google's manager of information security, Heather Adkins, recently announced that the 'game is over' for passwords and that 'our relationship with passwords are done.' Fingerprint authentication has become common in high-end laptops from companies such as Dell, Lenovo and Toshiba. Motorola also added a fingerprint scanner to its Atrix handset. Paypal's chief information security officer predicted that the end of passwords was nigh in May but added biometric technology wouldn't take off until Apple introduced it to a handset. Neil Norman, founder of Human Recognition Systems added that the release of the iPhone 5S may be the 'catalyst' needed to make the technology mainstream and fuel the demise of the password further. Although the security features of Apple's Touch ID have not been fully tested, research from Blue Coat Systems said there is a danger in assuming 'fingerprint recognition alone will stop the deluge of data streaming to cyber criminals and competitors.'

However, Paypal's chief information security officer claimed the technology wouldn't become mainstream until Apple added it to a handset, like on the iPhone 5S, pictured . Research carried out by password experts Ping Identity found that many people suffer from what's been dubbed 'password amnesia'. The survey discovered that 34 per cent of consumers need to remember more than five different passwords on a daily basis. 21.6 per cent need to remember more than eight different passwords . The password easiest to remember is a Facebook login (34.5 per cent) ahead of work log-in (25 per cent), online retailer (10.6 per cent) and online banking (12.2 per cent) Stephen Ebbett, global director of gadget insurer Protect Your Bubble added: 'Being able to use fingerprint security login for iTunes purchases is a nice touch, if it works. 'But while biometrics are typically seen . as more robust than password protection – sweat, dirty pockets, hot and . cold environments, sun exposure, and other factors can affect the . sensitivity and working conditions of the sensor surface.' Ebbett also told MailOnline that one of the most common claims for accidental damage to iPhones is screens shattering and he voiced concerns that the phone's durability could be an issue, especially if the fingerprint technology is fragile. However, not everyone was as quick to dismiss the technology. Jonathan French, security analyst for AppRiver told MailOnline: I see adding this feature as a good move on the security side of things and I hope more manufacturers consider adding security measures due to how popular mobile devices are. 'Fingerprint readers for the most part, are a secure method of authentication.

'Crabs, like other crustaceans, are capable of re-growing limbs and claws if they lose or damage them in a fight.

For any boss wondering why half their staff has called in sick on Tuesday morning, this will be the reason. The fifth, and much hyped, episode of Rockstar Game's controversial and Grand Theft Auto series will be released at midnight on Monday. Anticipating queues of gamers snaking down high streets all over the country, Rockstar has allegedly allocated 3million copies for the UK launch alone. Bi-winning: Each mission can be completed in a variety of different ways using a huge array of tactics . Autos: Set in a satirically re-imagined Los Angeles the game will feature a huge set of vehicles from cars to boats and even jet planes . Huge: From urban sprawl to isolated wilderness the map for GTA V will be one of the largest ever . If they sell on day one GTA will smash the UK record for fastest selling game of all time, currently held by Call of Duty: Black Ops which sold 1.4million on day one back in 2010. Rob Crossley, associate editor of gaming news site CVG, told The Guardian: '3million is an astonishing figure. 'Put it this way, that launch allocation accounts for a quarter of all combined Xbox 360 and PS3 owners in the UK.' How times change: When the franchise started in 1997 the graphics were 2D and looked nothing like the new ultra-detailed version . Play your way: Players can build their own team of fellow criminals to do business with, opting for cheap and stupid or expensive and specialised . What's your leisure?: Players will be able to take part in a variety of activities including golf, quad-bike racing and scuba diving . The game will also feature a huge online multiplayer mode, allowing gamers to meet up and complete missions together, race against their friends in planes, or hang out together in a virtual apartment. Players can also create challenges for their friends to compete in, from shoot-em-up deathmatches to 18-hole golf courses. This means that, even once the expansive storyline has been completed, there will be virtually limitless opportunities to try out new content. Characters: GTA V will feature three main characters who come together to organise robberies. Trevor, an unhinged man from a trailer park, is one of them . Conflicted: Ex-bank-robber and family man Micheal is another one of the main characters trying to balance a respectable lifestyle with his criminal past . Franklin: an ex-street gangster, he is the third main character. The opportunity to switch between all three will bringing a whole new element of strategy to the game . As with any GTA game players will be able to equip themselves with an arsenal of different weapons, personalise their character with clothing from a range of different stores, and fill a garage with highly customised cars. Unlike previous games however, career criminals will have different ways of investing their hard-earned and ill-gotten loot. A full functioning stock market will allow players to invest in lucrative ventures in the hope of making more money, or those of a less risky persuasion could chose to invest in real estate instead.","Controversial game will be released at midnight on Monday .

Their children may be fluent in Mandarin and accomplished violinists, but pushy mums can expect little thanks. A study found that ‘helicopter mothers’ who hover over and control their children’s lives are resented. And the bossier they are, the more the discontent builds. Resentment: 'Helicopter mothers' who hover over and control their children's lives can expect little thanks in the future, a study suggests . Researcher Professor Jean Ispa, from the University of Missouri, said: 'Children flourish when they have opportunities to make choices about what they do, particularly in play situations.' The University of Missouri team studied videos of children playing with their mothers. 'Mothers who are highly directive do not allow that kind of choice. In our study, the children were playing with some toys, and the very directive mothers were making the decisions about how to play, what to play and how quickly to play,' the professor said. 'Children flourish when they have opportunities to make choices about what they do' Professor Jean Ispa, University of Missouri . More than 2,000 children were taped when they were aged one, two and three and again before they started school. The pushy mothers tended to correct their children, rather than simply allowing them to have fun. For instance, when a child tried to put a plastic cow into a toy barn through the window, the mother would show them how to put it through the door instead. Bossy: Mothers who constantly correct young children may be stifling their creativity . And if a child was playing with a pretend kitchen set, the controlling mother might not let the child touch the fake burners on the stove. Professor Ispa, an expert in human development, said that while mothers might think they are helping the their children by correcting them, they may instead be stifling their creativity. Their interference may also mean their children find spending time with them less enjoyable. However, warm and caring parenting cancels out some of the negative effects of bossiness, according to the report published in the journal Parenting: Science and Practice. Professor Ispa said: 'Even if mothers were very directive, if they were also warm, the negative effects of high directiveness lessened. 'We know that children, regardless of culture, need to feel loved. 'Children take in the meaning of what their mothers are trying to do, so if a mum is being very directive and is generally a very warm person, I think the child feels, ""My mum is doing this because she cares about me, and she's trying to do the best for me."" 'If that warmth is missing, then the child might feel, ""My mum is trying to control me, and I don't like it.""' She added that as the children got older, the mothers tended to become less bossy, perhaps because they trusted them more. British head teachers have warned of the peril of 'helicopter parents', saying that ambitious mothers and fathers are condemning middle-class children to years of stress and anxiety. And some parents are still hovering over their children when they leave school. Universities have complained about parents joining their sons and daughters for freshers' week, with some even sleeping in their children's dorms.","Bossy mothers risk stifling children's creativity .

Zachary Holly, 28, is accused of killing six-year-old Jersey after abducting her in the middle of the night and dumping her body in a vacant house two doors down from the home she lived in with her two-year-old sister and mother. Holly, his arm shaking, listened as rape was added to charges of capital murder, kidnapping and residential burglary. Zachary Holly is escorted to a hearing in Bentonville, Arkansas, on Wednesday, Nov. 28, 2012 to appear in front of a judge where he was charged with killing 6-year-old Jersey Bridgeman . Jersey, whose father and stepmother were jailed last year for chaining her to a dresser, disappeared from her bedroom in her home in Bentonville, Arkansas on Tuesday November 20th - after babysitter Holly had put her to bed. The little girl had just started kindergarten after moving back in with her mother DesaRae Bridgeman and died of asphyxia or lack of oxygen, and physical evidence also showed signs of her being sexually assaulted, according to court documents. Holly was ordered held without bond and assigned a public defender. Formal charges will be filed sometime before his next court date, scheduled for January 7th. He didn't say anything to reporters as officers escorted him to and from the courtroom in Bentonville, a community about 215 miles northwest of Little Rock that's best known as the home of Wal-Mart's headquarters. These undated pictures show Jersey Bridgeman, whose body was found in a vacant house two days before Thanksgiving in Bentonville, Arkansas . Zachary Holly's home in Bentonville, which is next door to the home of 6-year-old Jersey Bridgeman, who lived next door with her mother . This booking photo provided by the Benton County Sheriff's office shows Zachary Dwayne Holly, who was booked on Monday, Nov. 26, 2012, on charges of residential burglary, kidnapping and capital murder in the Nov. 20 death of 6-year-old Jersey Bridgeman . Jersey's death comes after a short life marred by abuse. Last year, her father, David Bridgeman, and stepmother, Jana Bridgeman, were arrested child abuse charges in the nearby town of Rogers. David Bridgeman told investigators that he restrained the girl to keep her from getting into medication and other things in the house. He is serving an 18-year prison sentence after pleading guilty in June to false imprisonment, permitting the abuse of a minor and endangering the welfare of a minor. The stepmother is serving a 12-year sentence, plus three years for a probation revocation, after pleading guilty to the same charges. Last week, Jersey's body was found in a vacant house adjacent to Holly's and two doors down from where the girl lived with her mother. The night before her body was found, Jersey had been next door, where Holly and his wife, Amanda Holly, would often baby-sit Jersey and her younger sister, according to the court document. The document said Jersey's mother, DesaRae Bridgeman, told police she went next door to visit the couple after she came home from work around 11 p.m. on Nov. 19. Tragic: Jersey pictured with her biological mother DesaRae Bridgeman. It is not clear where she was when Jersey was reported missing . 'Afterwards, Zachary Holly carried Jersey home to DesaRae's house, while DesaRae carried Jersey's younger sister, and they placed the two children in the same bed,' Bentonville Detective Sgt. Kris Moffit wrote in the court document. When DesaRae Bridgeman woke up the next morning, Jersey was missing from the bed where her 2-year-old sister was still sleeping, the court document said. DesaRae Bridgeman looked around the house and then asked Zachary and Amanda Holly to help her before calling 911 to report Jersey missing, according to the court document. Police searched the Bridgeman and Holly homes before an officer noticed the back door of a nearby vacant house was open. Officers entered the house and found the girl's body. During an interview with authorities that day, Zachary Holly denied having anything to do with Jersey's disappearance or death, police said in the court document. They said he was cooperative and agreed to give detectives swabs of his check for DNA tests. Tragic: Jersey Bridgeman was chained to a dresser last year by her father and stepmom before moving to live with her biological mother . Questions: Holly is due to appear in court today in Arkansas, U.S. He also agreed to give detectives the clothes he wore the night before Jersey's body was found, according to the court document. Bentonville Police Chief Jon Simpson didn't immediately return a phone message left Wednesday. Prosecutor Van Stone and public defender Jay Saxton declined to comment after Holly's hearing. Behind Bars: Bridgeman's father was sentenced to 18 years in prison for having chain the girl to a dresser as punishment. No one answered the door Tuesday at the mobile home where police say Holly and his wife lived, but Amanda Holly's family issued a statement through a lawyer Wednesday asking for privacy. 'Jersey was a very sweet girl who our children and grandchildren considered their best friend. Because of this, we ask for privacy. The children in our family are not dealing well with the loss of their friend,' the family said. Jersey made headlines last year when her father and stepmother chained her to a dresser as part of a punishment. In conversations with childcare specialists, the six-year-old said that she slept on the floor of her parents' room and that she was tied up for misbehaving. 'She said that Jana and David chain her to the dresser because she had gotten up and eaten some pies, cereal, and bread,' Rogers Police Detective Larry Taylor wrote in the court affidavit. He added that the girl 'stated that they put a belt around her waist so that she could not get up and get any food.' The woman who first contacted the police about possible child endangerment said she saw Jersey tied up to the dresser with a silver chain, which appeared to be a dog collar. Bridgeman's father David admitted in court that he did tie up his daughter with a belt but defended his actions by saying that this was to prevent her from getting into medication and other dangerous materials around the house. 'He said that he thinks she may be sleepwalking and that they discussed buying a child gate, but since he does not have a job, they could not afford to buy one at that time,' Taylor wrote in the court affidavit. Relatives carry the casket of 6-year-old Jersey Bridgeman to her gravesite at Bentonville Cemetery in Bentonville last week . The father added that he had first cut a belt to fit around his daughter's ankle and added a lock on it after she had broken free. Then after she complained about the pain in her leg, he chained her by the waist instead. 'It should be noted that the chain that David used was approximately one to two feet in length and appeared to be a dog choke collar,' Taylor added. Both Bridgeman's father and stepmother pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, permitting abuse of a minor and endangering the welfare of a minor. For their crime, the father is serving an 18-year prison sentence, while the stepmother was sentenced to 12 years.","Zachary Holly has been charged with capital murder, kidnapping, rape and residential burglary .

The discovery could lead to enhanced sun creams that provide extra protection against burning and so reduce the odds of skin cancer. Breakthrough: The discovery ofthe chemical that makes the skin painful and itchy after being in the sun could lead to sun creams that provide extra protection against burning and so reduce the odds of skin cancer . Most cases of sunburn are caused by the sun’s UVB rays.  In moderation, this type of light is beneficial, as it boosts the body’s levels of vitamin B. But in excess, it damages the skin’s outermost layers, ageing the skin and raising the odds of cancer. The research, from Duke University in North Carolina, focused on a molecule called TRPV4 which is present in large amounts in the skin’s outer layer. Using mice and samples of human skin, the scientists showed the chemical to be key to the pain and damage of sunburn. For instance, mice genetically-engineered to lack TRPV4 in their skin, suffered few effects when exposed to UVB rays. In contrast, normal mice were extremely sensitive to touch and their skin blistered. An experimental drug had the same effect. Applied to the animals’ paws, it blocked TRPV4 from working, and protected the fine skin on the creatures’ paws from UV rays. Research on human skin samples was also promising, the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reports. The researchers say more work is needed but envisage sun screens containing TRPV4-blockers to protect against burning. Wolfgang Liedtke, one of the study’s senior authors, said: ‘I think we should be cautious because we want to see what inhibition of TRPV4 will do to other processes going on in the skin. ‘I could imagine it being mixed with traditional sunblock to provide stronger protections against UVB exposure.’ 'Very interesting': Matt Gass, of the British .

British experts described the research as ‘very interesting’. Matt Gass, of the British Association of Dermatologists, said anything that cut the odds of skin cancer would have a ‘profound impact’. He added: ‘Clearly this research is at an early stage, but we would welcome further study into this area to substantiate this suggestion. ‘Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, and one of the fastest growing cancers in young people – any progress in helping to prevent it would be an important step.’ The research could also lead to new treatments for other types of pain, including the hard-to-treat pain often suffered by people involved in road accidents. Dr Liedtke, who works in a pain clinic that treats victims of car crashes and gun shots, said: ‘We have discovered a novel explanation for why sunburn hurts. ‘If we understand sunburn better, we can understand pain better because what plagues my patients day in and day out is what temporarily affects otherwise healthy people who suffer sunburn.’","Researched focused on molecule in skin known as TRPV4 .
Sun creams that block this molecule cut risk of skin cancer ."
