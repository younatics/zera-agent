"Dallas Cowboys running back Joseph Randle was arrested for shoplifting at an up-scale department store chain outlet on Monday, say Frisco Police. Police attended the Dillard’s store at Stonebriar Mall in Frisco, north of Dallas, at 8.17pm, after the young NFL star was detained by security staff. Randle, 22, who signed a four-year, $2.35 million contract last year, was charged with Class B misdemeanour theft of goods between the value of $50 to $500. Dallas Cowboys' Joseph Randle was arrested for shoplifting at a Dillard's department store in Frisco, Texas . Randle, 22, was arrested on Monday and released after posting £220 bail on Tuesday morning . A police spokesman told the Dallas Morning News that Randle tried to take a pack of two black Polo underwear valued at $39.50  and a small bottle of Gucci Guilty Black cologne priced at $84. Randle, whose base salary this season is $495,000, was released from custody on Tuesday morning after posting bail of $350, police confirmed. Although behind DeMarco Murray in the Cowboys' pecking order, Randle played a key role in their side's win over defending Super Bowl champions Seattle on Sunday.

"A 'pork' sausage being sold in a Londis store was found to be almost half made up of horse meat. The lukanka chumerna sausage, imported from Bulgaria to the store in Dartford Kent by a British firm, was discovered at the height of the horse meat scandal. The vacuum-packed product was  labelled as containing pork sausage meat, but was actually 46 per cent horse. A lukanka sausage like the one found in Londis to contain nearly 50 per cent horse meat . Dartford Magistratres Court heard an investigation after the test purchase in October last year found it had been imported by London-based Expo Foods Limited. Despite the large media coverage concerning the presence of undeclared horse meat in various food products in January last year, the court was told the company undertook no tests on the sausage, which was imported in September 2013. Expo Foods pleaded guilty yesterday to a charge under the Food Safety Act that the product was not of the substance demanded. The company was fined £5,000 and ordered to pay £2,500 in costs to Kent County Council, who brought the prosecution, and a £120 surcharge. The shop was found not to be in breach of any regulations and had co-operated fully in the investigation . After the court case, the council said the shop was found not to be in breach of any regulations and had co-operated fully in the investigation. Richard Strawson, the council's trading standards manager, said: 'We are obviously concerned that this product was found on sale in Kent. 'We are aware of the sensitivities amongst the public concerning eating horse meat and therefore feel our actions were necessary to ensure that they can have confidence that what they eat is accurately described.' Following the sample results Expo Foods instigated a voluntary withdrawal of the product in liaison with their local authority and the Food Standards Agency. John Barnes, the Food Standards Agency's head of local delivery, said: 'We are pleased that trading standards services continue to be vigilant to ensure food is correctly described to enable the public to make informed choices about what they eat. We fully support Kent County Council in the action it has taken.'","Lukanka chumerna sausage imported from Bulgaria by British Expo Foods .

"The father of a 21-year-old woman who was allegedly stabbed to death this weekend by her girlfriend, 22, is shocked since he considered the suspect family. Casey Baird, father of stabbing-victim Tawnee Maria Baird, says he considered Victoria Mendoza to be like 'his other daughter' and was even helping her buy a uniform for her new job as a security guard. The couple of five years allegedly got into a 'violent' argument while driving home from a friend's house early Saturday, when the row escalated and Mendoza pulled into a parking lot and stabbed her girlfriend, police claim. She then called a mutual friend, who rushed to the scene and dialed 911, it is said. 'She's going to pay for this. It's ruined my life. I don't take death very well,' Mr Baird told the Desert News. 'To lose my one and only, it's unbelievable. I love you Tawnee. I just can't believe she's gone.' Scroll down for video . A father's loss: Casey Baird (right) pictured with his daughter Tawnee (left) who was allegedly stabbed to death by her girlfriend on Saturday in West Ogden, Utah . However, Mr Baird says in recent weeks, he had noticed signs of potential domestic violence in their relationship. About a month ago, Mr Baird noticed that his daughter's front tooth was missing and that Mendoza had scratches on her face and an injured hand. He says he 'bought' their story, which was that they had been attacked at a party. 'I feel a lot of guilt I didn't dig into that tooth deal,' he said. 'I'm hearing little bits and stories from friends of Tawnee that Tawnee was living in fear of Vickie.' The two met five years ago, while in a youth treatment center, Mr Baird said. He says his daughter was admitted to the behavioral health treatment facility, after she was issued a ticket for possession of drug paraphernalia. Tawnee and Mendoza were a case of 'opposites attract', with Mendoza being 'very jealous' and protective of his daughter who 'joked around and was flirty, not that that's grounds for this heinous crime.' Alleged murder: Tawnee (left), 21, allegedly got into a 'violent' fight with 22-year-old girlfriend Victoria Mendoza (right) while driving home from a friend's house early Saturday . Couple: Mendoza and Miss Baird, who lived together in Holladay, met five years ago in a youth treatment facility . Officers arrived at the parking lot at 2484 East Avenue in West Ogden at around 1am, where they found both Mendoza and the victim in the vehicle. Miss Baird was pronounced dead at the scene. 'We were actually responding on a call of a murder or someone wanting to turn themselves in for a murder,' Ogden Police Lieutenant, Tim Scott, said. 'I can tell you [Miss Baird] was stabbed to death, I can’t give you the number of stab marks or stab wounds, that will be determined by autopsy.' He added he could also not yet say what the fight was about, but that it was a 'violent, tumultuous encounter' that did 'culminate and lead to this incident where Ms Mendoza did stab her partner'. Parking lot: As the row escalated, Mendoza allegedly pulled into this parking lot (pictured) at 2484 East Avenue in Ogden, before fatally stabbing her partner of five years. Miss Baird died at the scene . Happier times: 'We were actually responding on a call of a murder or someone wanting to turn themselves in for a murder,' said Police Lieutenant Tim Scott. Above, Miss Baird with a cat (left) and Mendoza (right) Following the grim discovery on Saturday, police arrested Mendoza on suspicion of murder and booked her into Weber County Jail, where she is currently being held without bail. According to Fox 13, Mr Scott said Mendoza has been cooperative during the investigation. Investigators are now running background checks to see if Mendoza and Miss Baird had any history of domestic violence during the five years they were in a relationship. Yesterday, Mr Baird wrote on Facebook that he was flying back to Salt Lake City from Alabama after hearing that his daughter  had been killed by a woman 'all of us tried to help'. 'I love my lady bug more than I love myself,' he wrote on Facebook, referring to his daughter - who was a student at Salt Lake Community College - as his 'best friend'. Speaking directly to Mendoza, he added angrily: 'Don't try insanity plea!!!! In fact I don't even want the death penalty!!!! I want you to sit in a prison cell and have plenty of time to rottttt!"" Mendoza will shortly appear in court charged with first-degree felony murder.","Tawnee Maria Baird, 21, and Victoria Mendoza, 22, were in a five-year relationship .

"Drivers in a village in south Wales are bemused and confused after workmen painted double yellow lines - in a layby. The lines were painted on Friday in the village of Cwmffrwd on the outskirts of Carmarthen. One driver spoke to one of the workmen, who admitted he had never put double yellow lines in a lay-by before. Isn't that what a lay-by is for? The double yellow lines lines were painted on Friday in the village of Cwmffrwd on the outskirts of Carmarthen . The community council requested the double yellow lines, citing obstruction to the driveways . He told the South Wales Evening Post: 'I just don't understand it. It's a big lay-by. It's pathetic.' Carmarthenshire’s executive board member for transport services Colin Evans said: 'The double yellow lines have been laid following request from the community council as a result of persistent obstruction and blocking of driveways. 'The order was subject to consultation and no objections were received.' In April a council was accused of painting Britain’s most pointless double yellow lines which measure just 18in - too small to fit a single tyre. Residents were stunned when the lines appeared in Kingston, south west London, curved around a corner kerb at a three-way junction - but barely big enough for a toy car or a unicycle. Residents were stunned when the lines appeared in Kingston, south west London, curved around a corner kerb at a three-way junction - but barely big enough for a toy car or a unicycle. In 2012, double yellow lines measuring just 21in also appeared in Canterbury, Kent . Motorcyclist Oliver English, who spotted the lines, said: ‘I think it's stupid and a bit pointless. The way they've made the access road look pedestrian is very dangerous for pedestrians and motorcyclists . The shortest double lines in the UK were painted in August 2013 between a taxi rank and parking bays in Central London, measuring just over 9in. Westminster Council said it was a mistake made by a contractor, and would be corrected. Earlier last year, double yellow lines stretching for just 13in were discovered on a street in Cambridge. The shortest double lines in the UK were painted in August 2013 between a taxi rank and parking bays in Central London, measuring just over 9in . Baffled families slammed these barmy new yellow lines which measure just 21in . Cambridgeshire County Council described the lines as 'common practice'. A spokesman said: 'The yellow lines are at either end of a disabled parking bay and are there to prevent vehicles parked either side from encroaching on the disabled bay'. Council bosses also laid down 18in double yellow lines on parking bays in Highbury Crescent, north London, in 2007. In 2012, double yellow lines measuring just 21in also appeared in Canterbury, Kent.","Lines were painted Friday in the village of Cwmffrwd, south Wales .

"A plastic surgeon has used his body sculpting skills to create his dream woman before proposing to her on their first date. Dr David Matlock met his bride Veronica, 38, in 2007 when she was 40lbs heavier and visited him seeking what is commonly known as 'designer vagina' surgery after giving birth to her daughter Isabella, now aged nine. As well as the vaginoplasty, Dr Matlock suggested that the beautiful brunette also undergo a 'Wonder Woman Makeover', involving liposuction of the chin, arms, and legs, and a Brazilian butt lift. Love at first knife: Plastic surgeon Dr David Matlock asked his wife Veronica to marry him during their first date after they met when she visited him for vaginoplasty surgery . Before: Veronica before any of her surgeries with husband David Matlock, although she had already had breast implants with another surgeon . 'I couldn't even look into his eyes . because of the reason I was there,' she said. 'I was so shy and bashful, but he says . it was love at first sight.' Dr Matlock then took the now Mrs Matlock out for a date, immediately proposed to her, and has been helping her to enhance her figure ever since. 'I didn't see her weight then, I just knew what I wanted to do,' he said of their first meeting. 'She opted for everything I suggested. Even marriage.' Happy families: Veronica Matlock met her husband David when she went for vaginoplasty surgery after the birth of her daughter Isabella, now aged nine . Prior to meeting her 49-year-old husband, full-time nurse Mrs Matlock had undergone three breast augmentations. She has since had a Brazilian butt lift, vaginal . rejuvenation, labiaplasty and G-spot shot, liposuction to her chin, arms . and legs and, most recently, botox injections. 'I feel like I'm a walking advertisement for him,' she said. And it is not just his wife who has gone under the knife in her own quest for physical perfection - Dr Matlock has himself undergone several procedures that utilise a fat-implant technique called Vaser High Def Liposculpting, which he pioneered. Trimming the fat: Dr Matlock shows off his liposuction instruments at his clinic in Los Angeles, California . Practice what you preach: Dr Matlock has himself undergone several procedures that utilise a fat-implant technique called Vaser High Def Liposculpting, which he pioneered . Man at work: David Matlock was immediately smitten with Veronica, and suggested she also have a 'Wonder Woman Makeover', involving liposuction of the chin, arms, and legs, and a Brazilian butt lift . Healthy living: The couple maintain their perfect physiques with a gruelling diet, fitness regime, and specialist body-sculpting procedures . Six pack: As well as taking an array of food supplements and vitamins to stay in shape, Dr Matlock has had liposculpting done on on his pecs, biceps, and triceps . Made up of live fat from the patient's body, the implants can be injected into the biceps, triceps, calves, or pecs to create a perfectly sculpted, muscular figure. He is also trialling a procedure that involves injecting blood plasma rather than fat for patients like Dr Matlock who have very little fat. Dr Matlock, who appeared on the E! reality show Dr 90210, has also had liposculpting done on on his pecs, biceps, and triceps, and Botox injections to enhance his look. He said: 'I just wanted to take my body to a point where, with exercise and diet, you couldn't get it there.' Under pressure: Mrs Matlock says that as her husband keeps himself looking good it gives her extra pressure to do the same . Before and after: Fitness fanatic Dr Matlock shows off the results of his 10 week training schedule . Dr Matlock, who treats bodybuilders from all over the USA, added: 'We take out the fat under ultrasonic guidance and inject it into the muscles. 'I can sculpt out the biceps, the triceps, obliques, abs, calves, whatever.' Both Dr and Mrs Matlock compete in bodybuilding competitions where they show off their flawless physiques, and Mrs Matlock admits that her husband's obsession over fitness and beauty keeps her motivated to look her best. She entered in the bikini division of her first bodybuilding competition in October, but did not place. In his first competition, David placed third in the 35 and older Men's Physique division, and fourth in the 45 and older division. She said: 'Because he keeps himself looking good, it's added pressure. So I feel like I have to look good, you know.' Pick me up: Veronica Matlock has recently had botox, as administered by Dr Alex Simopoulos . Keeping it in the family: Dr Matlock also gets a botox injection from Dr Simopoulos as his wife looks on . Joint enterprise: Both Dr and Mrs Matlock enjoy getting Botox injections . In . preparation for a competition, David and Veronica eat six carefully . planned meals per day, consisting of lean chicken, fish, rice, and . vegetables. David eats at least 200 grams of protein a day to build lean . muscle. Dr Matlock said: 'I always eat healthy. A lot of my business is fat, doing liposuction all the time, but I don't like fat. 'I tell people I watch my weight, and I watch my wife's weight too.' Mrs Matlock said: 'I know that David loves me for who I am.' But she added, laughing: 'There's a fat clause there.' Mrs Matlock said that although the couple are both fitness fanatics her young daughter was not a fan of the healthy food her parents love. She said: 'We're still working on Isabella, getting her to be more accepting of eating healthy. 'She eats what David cooks, but, if we tell her if she's eating healthy, she says, ""No, healthy food doesn't taste good"".' Mrs Matlock admits however that when Dr Matlock is out of the house she will treat her daughter to the occasional snack. 'Her and I, we will spoil ourselves. We get frozen yogurt,' she said. No train, no gain: The Matlocks work with personal trainer and nutritionist Michele Dagona, right, to get them ready for their bodybuilding contests . Preparation: Ms Dagona describes getting ready for a competition as a 'whole other level of fitness' Going for gold: In his first competition, David placed third in the 35 and older Men's Physique division, and fourth in the 45 and older division . Strength training: In preparation for a competition David eats at least 200 grams of protein a day to build lean muscle . And despite her parents' love of surgery, Isabella herself says she has no interest in going under the knife when she gets older. 'I would never really want to get surgery, because it's not really you, like I want to be myself,' said the schoolgirl. Despite the occasional cheat day, Mr Matlock works tirelessly to ensure that he and his wife stay healthy at home. 'We have scales in the house, basically in the master bedroom,' he said. Cooking up a storm: Isabella Matlock, nine, prefers macaroni and cheese to her parent's healthy dinners . Family ties: Isabella said that she would never get surgery because she prefers to be herself . 'I weigh myself, and I do it every single day, sometimes twice a day. 'We also have lot of mirrors around the house. A lot of times, just in the gym, I want to look at our muscles.' Personal trainer and nutritionist Michele Dagona works with both David and Veronica for up to two hours a day, six days a week to get them competition ready. Ms Dagona said: 'Competition prep, it's a whole other level of fitness. It's totally outside the box compared to traditional training or nutrition.' Home sweet home: The couple live in the exclusive Bel Air area of Los Angeles, California . Behind the scenes: An inside view of the vaginoplasty instruments at Dr Matlock's clinic .

"She's no stranger to a sharp suit thanks to a lengthy career in journalism and Queen Letizia certainly knows how to style one. Chic in a navy suit enlivened with a cerise top, Letizia was every inch the royal style icon as she toured the Valle Del Cicados Institute in Calahorra. Never one to be left behind in the style stakes, husband King Felipe, 46, also opted for a splash of pink, teaming his dapper suit - also in navy - with a tie that was a perfect match for the colour of Letizia's top. Matchy matchy: The  royal couple opted for identical ensembles of a navy suit enlivened with a flash of pink . In the pink: Letizia has made a habit of wearing pink of late, in this case teaming the hue with a navy suit . This isn't the first time the couple have been spotted in co-ordinating ensembles. Last week, the pair were seen touring a farm show dressed in matching grey suits and its not unusual to see Felipe match his tie to Letizia's dress. Indeed, the couple welcomed the president and first lady of the Honduras to the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid on Wednesday wearing matching ensembles, with Letizia choosing a fuchsia dress and Felipe sporting a tie in the same shade. Letizia has made a habit of wearing colours on the pink spectrum of late, choosing Felipe Varela dresses in similar shades for the Honduran presidential visit and for an evening engagement a day earlier. Nevertheless, as she demonstrated today, she remains a fan of the neatly tailored Armani suits that became her trademark during her journalism career. Meet and greet: King Felipe is all smiles as he makes his way into the Institute, followed by Queen Letizia . Matching: Last week, the couple welcomed the Honduran president in coordinating cerise ensembles . Favourite colour: Last week saw Queen Letizia opt for the same designer in similar colours two days in a row . Matching: The couple also opted for similar outfits for their visit to the International Cattle Fair in Zafra . Warm welcome: Letizia poses with a group of young engineers before meeting medical students . And the Spanish royal has had plenty of uses for her tailored wardrobe of late, courtesy of a busy schedule that has seen them travel all over Spain. Today's visit, to Calahorra in the semi-autonomous region of La Rioja in northern Spain, was a case in point, with the couple meeting students preparing for a career in nursing during their tour of the Valle Del Cicados Institute. The Institute, which is a further education centre, specialises in humanities and medical studies, with English, Spanish Literature, religion and music all on offer to students. Many had been waiting outside the Institute to meet the royal couple, with both Felipe and Letizia obligingly posing for photographs in a repeat of last week's crowd scenes at the International Cattle Fair in Zafra, a town in south-eastern Spain. There, despite looking less than impressed during a run-in with a bull and a frisky Andalusian horse, Letizia, 42, charmed the crowds and posed for selfies with well-wishers. She also drew cheers when she stopped to pick up a little girl, plucking her from the crowd for a cuddle - much to the delight of her parents.

'We want people to see not just a friend but a friend they know they are long overdue to see. 'We hope it really takes off and people go to see their long-lost friends while raising money for charity.’ He added: 'The most important things in life are not things at all, but family and friends.

"David Cameron's bid to legislate for a referendum on Britain leaving the European Union has been blocked by the Lib Dems, MailOnline can reveal. The Prime Minister is understood to have urged Nick Clegg to give the people a say on Europe, but the Lib Dem leader refused to give government time for the EU Referendum Bill to pass through the Commons. Mr Cameron has pinned his hopes on the promise of an in-out vote to win back Ukip supporters, but support for Nigel Farage's party has soared to a new record high. David Cameron urged Nick Clegg to clear the way for the EU Referendum Bill to become law, but the pleas were rejected, the Tories claim . The coalition is bitterly divided on the idea of staging a referendum on Britain remaining in the bloc of 28 European countries. Mr Cameron has promised that if he is still Prime Minister after the next election he will renegotiate membership of the EU before staging in an in-out vote by 2017. The Tories were hoping to use a backbench bill to pass the necessary legislation, but claim the move has been scuppered by Mr Clegg. The Lib Dems demanded that in exchange for support for the EU referendum the Tories had to allow a backbench bill to curb the bedroom tax to continue. Tory MP Bob Neill, who was taking the Bill through Parliament, told MailOnline: 'The Lib Dems have killed off our chances of putting into law, this side of an election, an in out EU referendum by 2017. 'They didn't have the guts to vote against an EU referendum in the House of Commons. Instead they have used Westminster tricks to try to deny the British people a say on their membership of the EU.' The row centres on the need for a money resolution to be granted to allow the EU Referendum Bill to make progress through the Commons. The Lib Dems granted the resolution for a similar Bill last year, but the Tories say it has been refused this time. It is claimed Mr Clegg demanded changes to housing benefit – dubbed the 'bedroom tax' – as a price for agreement to allow the EU Bill to continue. Tory MP Bob Neill, who was trying to pass a law for an EU referendum, blamed the Lib Dems for blocking its passage through Parliament . The Lib Dems say the Tories offered to grant a money resolution to Lib Dem MP Andrew George's Bill on the bedroom tax, but  demanded both a money resolution and government time for Mr Neill’s backbench bill on the EU referendum. Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Malcolm Bruce said: 'There is a completely reasonable deal on the table here – each party gets a money bill for a Private Member's Bill they feel strongly about.' A senior Liberal Democrat source added: 'But the Tories are putting forward a proposal they know for certain will be turned down by the Lib Dems – a completely unfair deal. 'They know we are not about to sign up to their bill being given government time when it is neither the Liberal Democrats position, nor the Coalition Government's, especially when they are not prepared to offer anything in return. The Coalition Government is a two-way street. 'The Liberal Democrats were never going to block their referendum bill. We were happy to allow them to try and get it passed in the House of Commons. 'But the truth is they have folded like a cheap deck chair and are trying to make us take the blame by adding ridiculous conditions they knew we would not and could not accept. 'The only logical conclusion that can be reached is that the Tories don't really want their bill to pass and are trying to set the Lib Dems up as the scapegoats. Why else would they put forward a proposal they know cannot be agreed?' The Conservatives say the Lib Dem policy to ease the pressure of the benefits changes would cost £1billion. But a senior Lib Dem source said it would only cost £300million. Mr Neill added: 'This is will now be a major issue at the general election. Two parties – Labour and Lib Dems – have done everything they can to stop a referendum. 'Ukip aren't able to offer a referendum and a vote for them makes the prospect of a Labour government led by Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who don't want a referendum, more likely. 'Only David Cameron and the Conservatives are offering a renegotiation followed by an in-out referendum by 2017 if we are returned to office after the general election.' A new poll today showed support for Ukip has surged to a record level of support in the wake of Brussels' demands for an extra £1.7billion from Britain. Ukip has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a ComRes telephone poll in June . Some 19 per cent of people now say they will back Nigel Farage's party, twice the level seen early last year. Mr Farage last night said the EU should be told to 'get stuffed' and said the demand had been a 'gift' to his party. The rise of Ukip has come at the expense of both the main parties, with Labour slumped at the lowest level of support since Ed Miliband became leader. The Tories and Labour are neck and neck on just 30 per cent, the ComRes survey for The Independent showed. Senior Tories have pleaded with even voters who want to leave the European Union to stay with the Tories. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'If you want change in Europe, if you want a referendum on Europe, if you are against Europe and want to leave, the only party that will give you that vote is the Conservatives.'","EXCLUSIVE: Cameron urged Clegg to back legislation, but was rebuffed .

In spite of being the most highly paid female executive on the list, the editors felt that her influence and power diminished over the past 12 months. Last year Sandberg, 45, published ‘Lean In’ which was her call to arms for women to achieve their full potential. Scroll down for video . Losing popularity?Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, has slipped from fifth place to 10th in Fortune's annual 'World's Most Powerful Women' list. She is the most highly paid exec on the list . But critics lambasted her as being out of touch and with no idea about the reality of the workplace given that she earns £23 million a year. To compile its list Fortune analysed the importance of each woman in the global economy and their business, the arc of their career and their cultural influence. This meant that even though Facebook’s profits jumped 2,730 per cent last year and it made major acquisitions like virtual reality firm Oculus VR for £1.2 billion, Sandberg’s personal value went down. Another big loser was Marissa Mayer who slipped from 8th to 16th amid lingering questions over the real value of Yahoo, of which she is chief executive and president. Succesful: Yahoo's Marissa Mayer (left) also dropped down the list, falling from eighth place to 16th, while Ginni Rommerty, (right) the chief executive of IBM, stayed at the top of the list for the third year in a row . Mayer, 39, also sparked huge controversy by telling staff they could not work from home because it was bad for the business. At the same time she built a nursery next to her office which made it easier for her to balance motherhood with her career. It later emerged she made the decision after spying on employee logins to see how much they were slacking off. The most powerful businesswoman in the world is Ginni Rommety, 57, the chief executive of IBM, according to Fortune. She took the top spot for a third year in a row even though IBM’s revenue fell.

"The mother of terminal cancer patient Brittany Maynard who chose to end her life on Sunday has given a glimpse into her daughter's vibrant life. Debbie Ziegler, 56, described everything from cartwheels as a child to volunteering in Nepalese orphanages that made her only child 'smart', 'charismatic', and 'driven'. A single mom, Ziegler raised Maynard alone in Orange County, California, where she worked as a science teacher. Scroll down for video . Tribute: Brittany Maynard's mother Debbie Ziegler (pictured) described how her daughter would cartwheel for hours on end until she could do it perfectly. It was a sign of the love and effort she put into everything, she said . Love: She respected Brittany's decision to take her own life, saying it was her job to 'love her through it' Last week Maynard cried in a parting message, describing the painful prospect of leaving her mother childless. But Ziegler insists she feels blessed to have the shared 29 years before her daughter contracted Glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive tumor in her brain. 'Early on, I told her, ""It would be my honor to take care of you, whichever way; if you need to be fed or diapered, it would be my honor,""' she said. 'And that was important for me, for her to know.' 'She was a smart, pretty and charismatic little girl, so she asked to do a lot of things and she generally excelled at all of them,' Ziegler reminisced to the People. 'If she took ice skating, she'd excel at ice skating,' she said. 'I can remember her doing cartwheels and my telling her, ""I could never do cartwheels,"" but she just worked and worked and worked until she perfected it,' she said. She describes doing everything she could to give Maynard a vibrant childhood without siblings or a father. 'Today I chose to die with dignity': According to friends and family of Brittany Maynard, she passed away in her Portland, Oregon, home after her condition worsened on Sunday. She was surrounded by family and friends . Enriched: Ziegler describes how Maynard, pictured between her mother and husband, felt so strongly about the orphanages she worked in. Even suffering from cancer, she understood she had a high quality of life . Promise: She has promised to go to Machu Picchu on her daughter's behalf after her passing on Sunday . Plenty of their holidays were camping trips spent in Oregon, where Maynard - who married and took the last name Diaz - moved to end her life by taking advantage of the state's dignity with dying laws. On Sunday, she administered her lethal medicine and died in her bed at home in Portland surrounded by family. Twenty years earlier, she was just miles away dreaming of weddings and playing with her friend. 'She had a girlfriend, and she'd make clubhouses in these shrubs – dig under the shrubs and make little chairs and take out my silver-plated wedding gifts and bury them in the dirt,' Ziegler said. In the years that followed, Maynard went on to become a straight-A student at high school before enrolling at UC Berkeley then working in orphanages across south east Asia. Ziegler said the prospect of her daughter traveling to Asia was frightening, and she was astounded by the way Brittany dealt with the horrific situations she witnessed. Even after contracting terminal cancer, Brittany maintained . Ziegler said: 'She'd call me and say, ""Oh mom, it's awful.""' Debilitating: A scan shows the Glioblastoma multiforme that would claim her life slowly within 14 months . Tearful: Brittany wept days before her passing as she described the pain of leaving her mother childless . 'She'd try to get supplies and she'd take them to the orphanage, but the supplies never got distributed, so my daughter went in there and demanded to see where her supplies were. 'She said, ""I want you to show me where you put the supplies I gave you yesterday. They are for the children.""' 'She made them give them all back to her, and she took them into the room and gave them to the kids.' Maynard said, in the weeks before her passing, her biggest regret is that she never got to have a family, having worked extensively with children. 'I'd say most of my sadness centers around how much I wanted a family,' Maynard told CBS This Morning. However, the experience in Asia had a dramatic effect on Maynard's perspective on life: 'She knows that even with her brain tumor, she's still surrounded by love,' Ziegler said. 'She's still surrounded by comfort and care, and there are societies where that it not at all ever the case.' Now mourning the loss of her child, Ziegler said she will one day travel to Machu Picchu in Peru. She made a deal with her daughter that, after her passing, Brittany's spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking Inca ruins.","Debbie Ziegler, 56, describes cartwheels, day trips, and volunteering in Asia .

"A sense of belonging to the middle class occupies a cherished place in America. It conjures images of self-sufficient people with stable jobs and pleasant homes working toward prosperity. Yet nearly five years after the Great Recession ended, more people are coming to the painful realization that they're no longer part of it. They are former professionals now stocking shelves at grocery stores, retirees struggling with rising costs and people working part-time jobs but desperate for full-time pay. Such setbacks have emerged in economic statistics for several years. Now they're affecting how Americans think of themselves. Scroll down for video... Fewer and fewer: Delegates watch as former President Bill Clinton addresses the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina Since 2008, the number of people who call themselves middle class has fallen by a fifth . Since 2008, the number of people who call themselves middle class has fallen by nearly a fifth, according to a survey in January by the Pew Research Center, from 53 percent to 44 percent. Forty percent now identify as either lower-middle or lower class compared with just 25 percent in February 2008. According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans who say they're middle or upper-middle class fell 8 points between 2008 and 2012, to 55 percent. And the most recent General Social Survey, conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago, found that the vast proportion of Americans who call themselves middle or working class, though still high at 88 percent, is the lowest in the survey's 40-year history. It's fallen 4 percentage points since the recession began in 2007. The trend reflects a widening gap between the richest Americans and everyone else, one that's emerged gradually over decades and accelerated with the Great Recession. The difference between the income earned by the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans and by a median-income household has risen 24 percent in 30 years, according to the Census Bureau. In decline and we know it: A Pew study found earlier this year that the percentage of Americans who self-identify as middle class has fallen significantly in recent years . Whether or not people see themselves . as middle class, there's no agreed-upon definition of the term. In part, . it's a state of mind. Incomes or lifestyles that feel middle class in . Kansas can feel far different in Connecticut. People with substantial . incomes often identify as middle class if they live in urban centers . with costly food, housing and transportation. In . any case, individuals and families who feel they've slipped from the . middle class are likely to spend and borrow less. Such a pullback, in . turn, squeezes the economy, which is fueled mainly by consumer spending. ‘How they think is reflected in how they act,’ said Richard Morin, a senior editor at the Pew Research Center. People . are generally slow to acknowledge downward mobility. Many regard . themselves as middle class even if their incomes fall well above or . below the average. Experts say the rise in Americans who feel they've . slipped below the middle class suggests something deeply rooted. More . people now think ‘it's harder to achieve’ the American dream than . thought so several decades ago, said Mark Rank, a sociology professor at . Washington University in St. Louis. Three . years ago, Kristina Feldotte, 47, and her husband earned a combined . $80,000. She considered herself solidly middle class. The couple and . their four children regularly vacationed at a lake near their home in . Saginaw, Michigan. Part-time woes: Jeremy Horning lost his job at a warehouse and then went back to school. Now he works part-time at a call center . Constant searching: Rob McGahen of Pensacola has been searching since 2011 for a job that pays as well as his last position as a purchasing agent for Boeing . But in August 2012, Feldotte was laid off from her job as a special education teacher. She's since managed to find only part-time teaching work. Though her husband still works as a truck salesman, their income has sunk by more than half to $36,000. ‘Now we're on the upper end of lower class,’ Feldotte said. Americans' self-perception coincides with data documenting a shrinking middle class: The percentage of households with income within 50 percent of the median — one way to define a broad middle class — fell from 50 percent in 1970 to 42 percent in 2010. The Pew survey didn't ask respondents to specify their income. Still, Pew has found in the past that people who call themselves middle class generally fit the broad definitions that economists use. Roughly 8.4 percent of respondents to the General Social Survey, last conducted in 2012, said they consider themselves lower class. That's the survey's highest percentage ever, up from 5.4 percent in 2006. NORC is a social science research organization at the University of Chicago. Tom Smith, director of the survey, said even slight shifts are significant. Class self-identification ‘is traditionally one of the most stable measures’ in the survey, he said. By contrast to the most recent recession, the severe 1981-82 downturn had little effect on class self-identification in Smith's survey. Why do so many no longer regard themselves as middle class? A key reason is that the recession eliminated 8.7 million jobs. A disproportionate number were middle-income positions. Those losses left what economists describe as a ‘hollowed out’ workforce, with more higher- and lower-paying and fewer middle-income jobs. Rob McGahen, 30, hasn't yet found a job that paid as well as the purchasing agent position at Boeing's defense division that he left in 2011. Nervous about the sustainability of that job because of government defense cuts, McGahen quit after buying a bar near his St. Louis home. The bar eventually went bankrupt and cost him his house. He and his wife moved to Pensacola, Fla., where he's had little luck finding work in defense contracting. Now, he works in the produce section of a supermarket. His wife earns the bulk of their income as a speech pathologist. Their household income has been cut in half, from $110,000 to $55,000, and he and his wife have put off having children. ‘It's definitely been a step back,’ McGahen said. Now living in an apartment, he misses the couple's three-bedroom house on a quiet cul-de-sac in a St. Louis suburb. Home ownership is among factors economists cite as markers of middle-class status. Others include being able to vacation, help children pay for college and save for a secure retirement. Yet stagnant middle-class pay, combined with steep price increases for college, health care and homes, have made those expenses harder to afford. Median household income, adjusted for inflation, hasn't budged since 1996, according to the Census Bureau. Average college tuition has soared 174 percent in that time. Many of the formerly middle class are still struggling with student debt. McGahen, who has an MBA, estimates he'll be making $600 payments on student loans each month for the next decade. Feldotte, with two master's degrees, says she has ‘lots and lots of debt.’ And she isn't prepared to help her children pay for college. ‘There's no money to help them,’ she said. Some people feel they've fallen out of the middle class even as their incomes have remained stable, because their costs have risen. One is Richard Timmerman, 66, a retired postal employee in River Falls, Wis. He's been living off his pension since retiring five years ago. His wife, a sales manager at a hotel and conference center, hasn't had a raise in that time. The recession hammered the hotel's business, though it's slowly recovering. Yet his cost of living has risen in the past decade or so. Gas prices have surged over that time. So has food. And only this year did the value of Timmerman's retirement savings regain its level of six years ago. ‘I see my position in the social structure having gone down a notch,’ Timmerman said. He considers himself lower-middle class, compared with middle class a few years ago. A slowly improving U.S. economy could lift some people back into the middle class. Still, the recession and slow recovery have left permanent scars. McGahen and his wife are trying to rebuild their savings. They no longer have credit cards. Timmerman travels much less than he thought he would in retirement. ‘I have really beat myself up a lot over the last 2½ years,’ McGahen said. ‘Until I get myself up and going again and in a good place ... it is tough.’","The Great Recession has greatly widened the already growing gap between the richest and everyone else .

"A nurse has been sacked from a hospital after she was seen taking money from a patient's wallet - by a relative who was watching on the other side of the world on Skype. New dad Nick and his wife, Chrysa, were on a Skype call to family in Greece when they stepped away briefly to check on their baby in the nursery at Melbourne's Epworth hospital. Their family waited on the line, watching the live feed of the new parents' empty hospital room. Scroll down for video . Chrysa's husband Nick had money stolen from his wallet in her hospital room just after the birth of their baby . A female nurse was sacked from her job at Epworth Hospital in Victoria after being spotted on Skype stealing $20 from a patient's room . 'My husband came back first and his dad asked him ""where's your jacket and your wallet?"" because, he said, a lady came into the room,' the new mum told Fairfax Radio on Tuesday. 'She went to the chair - and my husband's jacket was there - she took the wallet, opened it and she took something.' The same nurse later visited the room as part of her duties. 'My father-in-law was still on Skype he confirmed that it was that person,' Chrysa said. An Epworth Hospital spokesperson said that theft in hospitals was a rising problem and the facility would now introduce security cameras in public areas to try and deter theft from patients . 'It wasn't much, it was only $20 but that is not right from a nurse.' 'We're very upset, we don't know why the lady did that, myabe she had problems?' Chrysa told Nine News. A hospital spokesperson said a nurse was dismissed for theft and she was required to hand the cash and a written apology to the family. 'Epworth confirms that a staff member was identified a few weeks ago on Skype stealing money from a patient's room,' Epworth media manager Colleen Coghlan said. 'Epworth took swift action and the staff member left Epworth's employment immediately.' Chrysa told ABC Radio that she wished that the nurse would not lose her job but did not want the same thing to happen to others. Chrysa said she was upset by the theft and said maybe the woman was struggling financially . Alan Kinkade, Epworth Health CEO, described the situation as awful, and said he believes other staff would be horrified by the incident . Mrs Coghlan said theft in hospitals was a rising problem and Epworth would introduce security cameras to public areas to deter theft from patients' rooms. 'The issue for public and private hospitals has been identifying the perpetrator,' she said. 'I'm shocked. I think it was a horrible experience for the patient concerned and it's not something that anybody expects to happen when they come in to be cared for in a hospital.' Alan Kinkade, Epworth Health CEO echoed this when speaking to Nine News. 'It's awful, awful. I think for our other 5000 staff they would be horrified that this has occurred.' he said.","Nurse caught out stealing money while the patient was out of her hospital room checking on her new-born baby .

"The wife of  Alex Rodriguez's cousin has branded him ‘evil’ for urinating on a wall at their house in a bid to  keep them quiet about his  use of performance enhancing drugs. Carmen Sucart blasted Rodriguez for allegedly committing the foul act at the couple's Miami home and criticized him for accusing her deathly ill husband of trying to extort him. Her husband Yuri Sucart is Rodriguez's cousin and alleged to be his steroid mule, but she told The New York Daily News: 'He [Rodriguez] is the devil. He is evil.’ Scroll down for video . Disgusting: Carmen Sucart's husband is Yuri Sucart, A-Rod's estranged cousin and alleged steroid mule . Foul: Sucart, seen here, blasted Rodriguez for allegedly committing the foul act in the couple's Miami home . Career blow: New York Yankees superstar Alex Rodriguez admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs in an interview with federal agents, the Miami Herald reported on Wednesday . She said Rodriguez paid them a visit at their Miami home -which he bought for them -  and warned them against going public with information about his use of performance enhancing drugs. She said  he then urinated on the wall and the patio in a move to show them that he was serious. Sucart said: ‘He peed on the floor. He was so arrogant, he came into my house like he thought he was a god.’ She said her husband, who used to work for Rodriguez, was on call for him 24 hours a day, seven days a week, but the superstar treated him like a ‘slave, a servant.’ Despite this, her husband was very fond of Rodriguez and even helped to raise him after  his family abandoned him as a child. Now, her husband is so ill that he is bed bound and surrounded by a breathing machine and pill bottles. He can barely walk, and one of his legs could be amputated, his wife said. Her husband has been in poor health  following open-heart surgery and operations on both of his legs. He is also diabetic and suffers from high blood pressure. He was arrested on August 5 and held in jail until August 17, his wife said, and then taken to a hospital because his condition worsened. She found him there August 21, she said. She said: ‘Yuri may not survive and the family don't care,’ adding that A-Rod mocked her husband for being out of shape and called him the ‘N’ word. Breaking the rules: The 39-year-old allegedly purchased hormone-filled syringes and creams from the now-defunct Miami-area Biogenesis clinic . ‘(He) made fun of him for being overweight and because his teeth are bad and falling out. His teeth are bad because he is on blood thinners for his heart.’ Yuri Sucart is currently fighting seven federal felony charges and is scheduled to go on trial in February when Rodriguez could be called to testify. Furthermore, Sucart claims that Rodriguez lied when he told Drug Enforcement Administration agents that a lawyer representing her husband sent him a letter asking for cash  in 2012. She said he made the allegations last January, when he agreed to cooperate with federal agents prosecuting Anthony Bosch and his Biogenesis doping clinic in exchange for limited immunity from prosecution. He told agents that his cousin sent him an ‘extortion letter’ demanding $5 million for his silence on his relationship with  Bosch. But Jeffrey Sonn, the Miami attorney  who represented Sucart at the time and wrote the letter, said he sought a settlement because Rodriguez had broken his promise to employ his cousin for life. Sonn said that the superstar had told his cousin that he would look after him after he got him involved  in 2009 when he denied steroid use. Top of his game: The Yankees star was the American League's most valuable player in 2003, 2005 and 2007 . ‘This was a simple case about breach of contract,’ Sonn said. In 2013, Rodriguez entered into a confidential settlement with Yuri Sucart  agreeing to pay him one $700,000 payment for his silence. This was arranged along with three more payments made to Sucart that totalled $200,000, according to court papers filed in Miami last week. However, it has been revealed that the superstar player did admit using performance-enhancing drugs in an interview with federal agents. Details of the bombshell revelations were obtained by The Miami Herald who gained access to the documents as prosecutors pursue criminal charges against Bosch and six others  including Yuri Sucart. Rodriguez admitted to buying and using hormone-filled syringes and creams from the clinic, the Herald reported, citing a 15-page summary of the meeting. He injected human growth hormone into his stomach and described to federal authorities how the owner of the now-defunct clinic gave him tips on evading Major League Baseball's doping tests. Rodriguez could face even more legal woes if he is found to have steered players to Bosch.","Carmen Sucart is the wife of Rodriguez's estranged cousin - Yuri Sucart .

"Daniel Thrower has been jailed at Leeds Crown Court for causing serious injury to JJ Kichalowski, two . A drink-driver who caused a head-on crash which left a two-year-old boy paralysed for life after driving on the wrong side of the road while banned has been jailed for 18 months. Daniel Thrower, 34, left JJ Michalowski with horrific injuries in the crash in Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, which happened just hours after the toddler had walked upstairs for the first time. Leeds Crown Court heard the little boy's injuries were so severe that he will never walk again, and he requires a ventilator to help him to breathe while he sleeps. JJ's family, including mother Katy and father Igor, who had been driving the vehicle at the time, were at court today, to hear Thrower will serve just 18 months for the crime. The court was told that on the evening of the incident, father-of-two Thrower drank around four cans of beer before taking his girlfriend's car from the house they share, despite having no valid insurance and a revoked licence following a drink-drive incident six years ago. While driving the wrong way down the A628 bypass in Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, he encountered Mr Michalowski, 30, who was behind the wheel of a Peugeot 407, with his children JJ, Llacia and Leah as passengers. Their mother Katy, 27, had been asked to swap her shift at the nursing home where she worked, so her husband dropped her off, but because of the time they had to take her, their three children went with them. 'The children were in their pyjamas and JJ slept on the outward journey,' said Michael Smith, prosecuting. 'She has been dropped off at work just before 10pm. 'Mr Michalowski joined the A628 travelling just under 60mph.' However, it was then that Thrower began to drive towards them, forcing Mr Michalowski to swerve to the side of the road. 'There were no other oncoming vehicles and no reason why the vehicle was in the wrong lane,' said Mr Smith. Mr Michalowki told police that 'it felt like everything exploded, the airbags went off and there was a smell of battery acid and fuel everywhere'. The court heard Mr Michalowski managed to force his door open and get the two girls out of the vehicle before going back for JJ, who 'tried to say daddy but his cries were strange and he was then sick'. Thrower, 34, left JJ Michalowski (pictured with his mother Katy) with horrific injuries in the crash in Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, which happened just hours after the toddler had walked upstairs for the first time . Mr Smith said: 'Although all the family suffered some injuries, the greatest injuries were suffered by JJ. 'There were severe injuries to his spinal cord. In essence he had been paralysed from the trunk down.' Evidence from a doctor's report read out to the court said: 'It's highly unlikely, in reality almost impossible, that he will walk again in the future. 'He will require a wheelchair for many activities in his daily life.' During the hearing, a victim impact statement written by JJ's family was read out, in which they revealed they have not been able to give him a proper cuddle since the incident on March 8 this year. It read: 'There was no need for any of this to happen, but we're now left to pick up the pieces of the actions of someone who has devastated our family. 'JJ should have been able to run around and have a normal happy childhood, but this has been cruelly taken away. 'He had only just walked upstairs. He may never be able to walk or appreciate what it was like. 'He's still fighting but he's not the same and will not be able to do what his sisters do. Leeds Crown Court heard the little boy's injuries were so severe that he will never walk again, and he requires a ventilator to help him to breathe while he sleeps . 'He's been robbed of being a happy and healthy little boy.' The court heard that Thrower, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, was also taken to hospital following the crash, but was 'uncooperative with hospital staff' and had to be handcuffed to a bed. He had been taking medication for depression following the breakdown of an 18-year relationship. Mr Smith said staff at the hospital reported him to be 'unaffected and unphased by the gravity of the situation'. Richard Davies, defending, told the court that Thrower had previously taken a car without the owners' consent in 1999 and had his licence revoked in 2008 for driving with excess alcohol. He also said Thrower had been taking medication for depression following the relationship breakdown, and had been offered a new job the day before the crash. Jailing Thrower for three years for causing serious injury by dangerous driving and aggravated vehicle taking, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: 'This was no momentary piece of bad driving. 'You decided to drive even though you knew you had no permission, no insurance, no driving licence, and you must have known you were in no fit condition to get behind the wheel of a motor car. JJ's family, including mother Katy (right) and father Igor (left), who had been driving the vehicle at the time, were at court today, to hear Thrower will serve just 18 months for the crime . 'Unhappily, JJ was strapped into the car seat in the back and suffered severe spinal injuries. 'At this time he had just started to walk. He's now paralysed from the trunk down and there's been no detected volume of movement in his legs. 'The sentence I impose upon you is not intended to be a measure of the devastation and misery you have imposed upon his family.' Following the hearing, JJ's family, of South Elmsall, West Yorkshire, spoke of their ordeal. Igor said: 'I don't think it's ever going to be enough of a sentence for what he's done. 'The horrors just won't go away. 'We want to focus on JJ's future and getting him better and getting as much out of him as we can, while keeping him happy. 'The roads at least will be a lot safer for the next 18 months.' JJ's grandmother, Lesley Liddle, said: 'We hate him. I hope everyone knows him for the scumbag he is. 'He made a conscious decision to get behind the wheel of a motor vehicle when he had been drinking.' And his aunt, Lynne Clifford, said: 'He should never be given his licence back. 'The laws don't protect innocent people. The laws need to be changed.' Thrower was also disqualified from driving for three years, after which he must pass an advanced driving course before he can re-apply for a driving licence. JJ's family are now aiming to raise money to buy specialist equipment, including a joystick-controlled wheelchair, to give him back some independence.

"A woman who appeared on TV claiming that no one would give her a job because she was too fat was caught shoplifting cakes just hours later, it emerged today. Jay Cole was interviewed on ITV's This Morning last month, complaining that employers discriminated against her because she is 22st. But later that same day, she was caught stealing baked goods, champagne and deodorant from her local branch of Sainsbury's. Police apparently recognised her on CCTV footage after watching her TV appearance earlier in the day. Scroll down for video . Arrested: Jay Cole has been given a caution for stealing food from a supermarket after appearing on TV to complain she was too fat to find work . Cole, 24, told presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that she had never had a full-time job because of her size. The single mother, from Tonbridge in Kent, complained: 'I have gone for everything. Cleaning jobs, retail, nursery nurse. But when I go to interviews you can see the disappointment automatically. 'They think that fat people are lazy and not capable and cannot do what normal sized people can do.' Former Apprentice host Katie Hopkins also appeared on the programme, and told Cole: 'I would never employ somebody of your size.' Criticism: Cole was joined by Apprentice contestant Katie Hopkins, who said she would not employ her . Soon after the broadcast on February 27, Cole visited a branch of Sainsbury's near her council house and stole £42 worth of food and other products. She was later arrested given a police caution for the theft, as well as for another shoplifting incident earlier in the month which saw her steal around £20 worth of goods. A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'A 24 year-old woman accepted a police caution following two reports of theft from Sainsbury's in Tonbridge on 19 February and 27 February. 'Items reported stolen included bakery items, energy drinks, champagne and deodorant. The woman was arrested on 1 March.' Shoplifting: Among the goods stolen by Cole were pastries, cakes, champagne and deodorant . Despite claiming she is regularly applying for jobs, Cole has only attended 12 interviews in five years, but insists she is keen to get off benefits. She has been given a two-bedroom council flat and has her council tax paid, claiming a total of £227 a week in benefits. Cole's benefits allow her to get clothing vouchers for job interviews, free prescriptions and discounted Tube travel.","Jay Cole, a 24-year-old single mother, claimed employers were prejudiced .

"A postman helped steal £141,000 from Royal Mail customers by swiping letters containing personal bank details, a court heard today. Archie Johnson is accused of targeting post addressed to recipients in London's W1 postcode, encompassing the upmarket West End district, to steal personal financial information. This was then used by accomplices to impersonate account holders and defraud their bank accounts, the court heard. 'Position of trust': Archie Johnson is accused of abusing his role as a postman to steal personal financial information from letters addressed to recipients in London's upmarket W1 post code area . Prosecutor Warwick Tatford said: 'Post men are given positions of trust - they look after the mail and they are entrusted to deliver it to the right address and also not to steal it. 'Sadly the Crown's case is that this defendant did steal mail and he didn't just steal things like DVDs or books or money in birthday cards - nothing like that - what he stole was financial information.' In a scam running between 2008 and 2012, Johnson felt envelopes for bank cards then passed them on to fraudsters higher up the chain, prosecutors alleged. Jurors were told Johnson was 'acting on orders' from other people. Prosecutors said there is 'clear evidence' Johnson stole 'a lot of items'. Bank cards were found in his car, the court heard. 'What he did was target financial documents, in particular bank statements, debit cards and PIN numbers,' said Mr Tatford. 'It is probably pretty obvious to anybody that a hard rectangular shape in an envelope is some kind of bank card. 'Bank statements also are obvious pieces of post and you will know if you have bank accounts that PIN numbers come out in the post as well a few days after cards are sent.' Johnson was 'a cog' in a wider fraud that hijacked bank cards in the W1 postcode of London, prosecutors said. Other members of the gang would allegedly impersonate the card holders to empty the accounts of cash. 'What happened in this case, and the defendant was a vital cog in this conspiracy, is that criminals were pretending to be owners of cards and they answered security questions,' said Mr Tatford. 'They have derived a certain amount of information to be able to answer security questions and they created a situation where the card was sent out to the owner.' Johnson then intercepted the private post and the cards were rinsed of cash before the account owners noticed and alerted their banks, jurors were told. Place of work: A Royal Mail worker steps out of a van at the Rathbone Place depot, where Johnson worked and carried on the scam between 2008 and 2012. File image, there is no suggestion this man was involved . The total losses to Santander from the allegeldy hijacked data was £93,853. Barclays suffered losses of £47,550 from the alleged fraud, the court heard. 'The defendant was a cog in the machine, he didn't, it would appear, profit greatly by this,' said Mr Tatford. 'Perhaps it is the nature of many criminal conspiracies - those in a safe position are ones that keep most of the money. 'A postman may be able to give useful information to his leaders, the people further up the chain, because the postman finds out a lot about people. 'It may well be that the reason those fraudsters were able to answer security questions is that they were able to be fed personal information that the defendant discovered simply by being a postman to this particular address.' Johnson worked at Royal Mail premises in Rathbone Place near Tottenham Court Road in central London. He was arrested after investigators linked his postal rounds with the stolen details, the court heard. Johnson, of Stoke Newington, north London, denies conspiracy to steal. The trial continues.

"Jailed: Duncan Schwier, pictured arriving at Isleworth Crown Court today, stole from the world's largest musical corporation for more than a decade . A music executive who admitted to stealing almost £650,000 from record label giant Universal Music Group - whose artists include U2 and Prince - was today jailed for three years. Duncan Schwier, the company's former head of global production, swindled the world's largest musical corporation with false invoices for more than a decade. The 52-year-old claimed that he had given most of the money to his colleagues and to charity after a series of medical conditions left him behaving erratically. The con only came to light when Schwier was promoted and his successor raised the alarm after noticing scores of invoices paid to non-existent companies. Schwier, from Twickenham, west London, pleaded guilty earlier this month to one count of stealing £643,697.35 between December 31, 2001 and December 31, last year, from Universal - where he had worked since 1984. The French-owned multinational represents artists including U2, Eminem, 50 Cent and Jennifer Lopez. Prosecutor Olu Phillips told Isleworth Crown Court that an enquiry and investigation had revealed that the defendant had stolen the money by paying invoices for two 'fictitious' companies. He said: 'Once the transactions were authorised the payments were made and funds went into one of his bank accounts.' Shwier spent £400,000 on staff bonuses, parties and gifts - with one colleague getting an expensive guitar as a leaving present - and gave £100,000 to charity, the court heard. Schwier, who put his six-bedroom detached Edwardian house on the market for £1.75million last year, admitted the theft immediately and repaid all the money soon after, the court heard. Lawrence Selby, defending, told the court how the longstanding employee of Universal Music Group had been rendered irresponsible because of his condition. The executive’s poor health, which began with a diagnosis of Graves disease in 1998, left him with impaired judgement, he claimed. The disease can lead to hyperactivity in suffers, although a judge allowed precise details of his medical record to be withheld. Mr Selby said: 'It is a fairly depressing read that unfortunately nobody was able to effectively diagnose Mr Schwier. 'He reacted badly to medication and things went badly from one thing to another. 'It’s the sort of decade that those would not want to experience either personally or through those closest to them. 'He was working in a pressure cooker industry, unable to cry for help, unaware he was suffering in the way that he was, and these acts were a release for the stress and pressure.' He claimed that he gave away £400,000 to his own staff in gifts and bonuses and £100,000 to various charities. Shwier, pictured, spent £400,000 on staff bonuses, parties and gifts - with one colleague getting an expensive guitar as a leaving present - and gave £100,000 to charity, the court heard . The first staff gift was an expensive guitar for a colleague who was leaving and the bonuses, parties and dinners followed. The court heard how the theft came to an end when he was diagnosed with cancer, believing it was terminal. Mr Selby said: 'This was not theft that was motivated by greed or personal gain... it is theft more like someone who is addicted to something, who needs satisfaction of that addiction to survive.' He said Mr Schwier did not spend the money on himself or his family, whose lives remained the same throughout the con. Universal Music Group initially dealt with the theft internally before alerting police. Schwier admitted the theft immediately and repaid all the money soon after, Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) heard . He had driven the same 'clapped-out' Volvo for 15 years and 'displayed no signs of an ostentatious lifestyle', the court heard. Universal Music Group initially dealt with the theft internally before alerting police. Schwier admitted the theft immediately and repaid all the money soon after, the court heard. Judge Aidan Marron, QC, said a custodial sentence was unavoidable. Jailing the executive for three years, he said: 'I accept that on the medical evidence put before me that throughout this period you suffered from serious medical disability that impacted on your judgement and ability. 'But at the end of the day the serious breach of trust over more than a decade I’m afraid that a custodial sentence is inevitable.'","Duncan Schwier admitted to stealing money over more than a decade .

"Fined: Robert Thielen discovered earlier this year that his 30-year-old fiancee, who was named only as Diana, was a high-class escort . A financier has been ordered to honour a £862,000 cheque that he gave his ex-fiancee before finding out that she was an international prostitute. Private equities boss Robert Thielen, 52, had proposed to the Russian call girl, identified only as Diana, two years ago. A court in Monaco heard he handed her a cheque for one million euros – the equivalent of £862,000 – as an ‘unconditional financial security’ to be cashed after they were married. But Mr Thielen, who was born in the Netherlands, discovered earlier this year that his 30-year-old fiancee was a high-class escort. The court heard that she was selling sex in London, Moscow and the French Riviera. It was even claimed that the wealthy property tycoon had been paying for her flights as she jetted across Europe servicing her clients. Mr Thielen swiftly called off the engagement and demanded that she return gifts and jewellery including a £60,000 diamond engagement ring. His ex-lover refused, and when the one million euro cheque was bounced by Mr Thielen’s Monaco bank, the call girl took him to court to demand the money. Thielen told the Monaco correctional court: ‘As soon as I found out about her job, I broke off the engagement and demanded the return of both the jewellery and the cheque.’ A Monaco court has ordered a wealthy London businessman to pay one million euros to his ex-fiancee that he promised her before learning she was a prostitute . But the prostitute told the judge: . ‘He told me the cheque was a guarantee of security to avoid having any . kind of marriage contract, and we agreed I would cash it after we were . married.’ Mr Thielen, who has invested in . multi-million-pound property in London, was told to honour the cheque . and pay a £860 fine, but intends to appeal the ruling. His spokesman called the case ‘a very unpleasant matter’.

"Patients are waiting more than 12 hours in A&E due to a lack of hospital beds, NHS figures show. Last week nearly 4,500 were in casualty for at least four hours in need of a bed, including 13 people who were there for more than 12 hours. Figures also show that the NHS has missed its target for ensuring patients are dealt with within four hours for the fourth week in a row. Nearly 4,500 were in casualty for at least four hours in need of a bed last week, including 13 people who were there for more than 12 hours. Casualty departments are normally less busy during the summer and early autumn but the latest figures suggest they are under surprising pressure. Many hospitals are having to cancel non-urgent operations to free-up staff and ward space for patients coming in from A&E. The NHS is meant to ensure that 95 per cent of patients are dealt with in A&E within four hours and either sent home or admitted on to a ward. But the latest weekly figures show that only 94.7 per cent were treated within this timeframe and the target has not been met since the end of August. A total of 4,467 patients were in A&E for more than four hours after doctors had decided they needed to be admitted to a ward. This does not include the numbers of patients waiting in A&E who were then sent home – the NHS does not publish this information. The NHS is meant to ensure that 95 per cent of patients are dealt with in A&E within four hours . Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘A&E is getting worse by the week. ‘Under this Government, we have seen the emergence of the summer crisis in A&E. David Cameron must get a grip on this.’ An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Over the last three years, frontline staff have made an incredible effort to ensure standards of care remain high. But it is clear the NHS is under pressure.’ Chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said GP waiting times are a ‘national disgrace’. She warned that many patients were giving up even trying to get an appointment, meaning serious illnesses could be missed at an early stage.","Patients are waiting more than 12 hours in A&E due to a lack of beds .

"A girl has overcome cruel bullying at school to succeed at the usual combination of both kickboxing and as a beauty queen. Charlotte Rowlett, now 23, from Sheffield, was living in fear  at school so took up karate to protect herself from vicious attacks from other students. As a teenager, she competed in one-on-one fights outside the classroom and took up kickboxing to boost her confidence. Charlotte is skilled at the unusual combination of pageantry and mixed martial arts . Charlotte took up karate to protect herself from vicious attacks from other students (left) but has now turn her hand to the world of beauty pageants (left) After training with her partner Danny, also 23, she went on to become a mixed martial arts expert, she turned her hand to pageants and was thrilled to be crowned Miss British Empire South Yorkshire 2014. Charlotte, who works as a nail technician and trains at Marsdens All Styles in Hillsborough, was often tripped and kicked by fellow school pupils. But she claimed gold and silver medals at various interclub competitions for fighting and performing technical katas (choreographed routines). Charlotte said: 'I wasn't what you'd call a cool kid in school. 'I was quiet and had a small close group of friends. 'It started off with name-calling in primary school but in secondary school it got much worse - people started shoving and tripping me and locking me out of classrooms. 'I remember being spat on and people putting chewing gum in my hair or on my seat - it was awful. 'After a few sessions of karate I really started to enjoy it - it really boosted my confidence. To marry her two hobbies, Charlotte has to abstain from fighting properly for around six weeks before a beauty contest to avoid getting any unsightly bruises or cuts . 'Bullies always look for an easy target which I no longer was - I walked with my head held high. 'Then I started a school yard relationship with Danny and I've never looked back since.' Two years ago, Charlotte swapped her boxing gloves for nail polish when her mother Alison, 49, entered her into the Miss Chesterfield competition. She went on to win her first crown and after this year's event in her home town of Sheffield is preparing to compete in the national Mrs Galaxy event next year. Thrilled Charlotte married her kickboxing partner Danny, an engineer, in June after being together for 10 years. Charlotte says doing pageants have helped boost her confidence . She said: 'It's a complete contrast to be fighting one minute then dressing up for a beauty pageant a few weeks later. 'But I really love doing both and they've really helped me beat the bullies and show people what I can do. 'I don't fight properly for around six weeks before a beauty contest because there'd be nothing worse than turning up to a competition covered in cuts and bruises. 'I still do some training with Danny at home but we make sure we don't go all guns blazing in the build-up to a competition. 'It's a great way for us both to let off steam and I know he'll always help me with my technique to make sure I'm getting the most out of it. 'The pageants have helped me build my confidence even further - I never realised the amount of good work they do with charities - it's very rewarding.' Grateful Charlotte has thanked her mother, Alison, 49, and long-term partner Danny for helping her beat the bullies. The beauty queen said: 'I never wanted to go out and fight with people - it was just a way for me to feel safer if something did happen.' Charlotte - who is the current Mrs Sheffield Galaxy - will compete at the national finals in February next year and if she wins will represent the UK in Florida. The Mrs Galaxy event forms part of the United Kingdom Galaxy Pageants which specialises in allowing married women to compete. Charlotte is sponsored by Sistachic Hair Extensions and Beauty and her dress sponsor and creator is KMR bespoke Bridal and Occasion Design.","Being kicked and tripped at school prompted Charlotte to start Karate .

"Every Saturday night, we can expect the same, soggy X Factor weather forecast. A hurricane of hurt, closely followed by a tear-nado ripping across Cheryl’s carefully applied make-up, causing widespread disruption of her mascara. Yes, there will be the occasional showers in the vicinity of Mel B. Sometimes even Louis looks a bit damp near coastal areas — and Simon certainly seems slightly overcast when he reads the latest viewing figures. Yet the full-scale flooding alert remains in place only over Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, with further tears expected to fall on already saturated ground and the prospect of even more to come at the judges’ houses stage this weekend. Scroll down for video . Episode 10: As Andrea Faustini warbles away, Chezza weeps so much you've got to wonder if her false eyelashes are welded on with a new strain of water-resistant superglue . Episode One (left): Cheryl starts as she means to go on during Amy Connelly's audition and (right) during episode two Cheryl wells up as vocally-challenged Linzi Martin from Nineties band Girl Thing gets a no . What is wrong with Cheryl, who has been sobbing since the very first episode? She cries when contestants are good, she cries when they are bad, she cries whenever she feels like it, which appears to be most of the time. For the returning Geordie judge, much of this series of the Blub Factor has been a three-hankie weepie, a two-tissue sobfest, a one-woman show of emotion in a never-ending ugly bug bawl. It is understandable if the poor contestants, especially the rejects, burst into tears while holding their head in their hands, moaning softly. But why-oh-why, particularly given how much she gets paid, should Cheryl be so distraught? Yet since the first episode of this series, the newly-married 31-year-old has been weeping like an open wound. By now, we all know the warning signs that signal a Cheryl sob storm is imminent. The wobbly lip and chin. The promise to some poor, warbling misfit that they are ‘just my cuppa tea’. That photogenic, misty look into the middle distance. Episode three: Monica Michael sings a syrupy self-penned tribute to her little sister, reminding Cheryl that she also has a sister and (right) Cheryl reaches for the tissues during Jake Quickenden's performance during episode four . And then the brimming eyes as Cheryl realises that the auditionee reminds Cheryl of a younger Cheryl; of a time when Cheryl herself was a struggling Cheryl and not the millionaire-popstar, professional-mime-artiste and flogger-of-hairspray-and-perfumes Cheryl that she is today. Blub! She’s like sequined semtex. Anything can set her off. In the very first episode, Cheryl was weeping as she hugged a contestant she had briefly met years ago. This seemed an unlikely wellspring of emotion, but never mind. A silvery teardrop trickled down her face, like a rivulet of ice melt inching down a beige glacier. At her side, Mel B went to pieces during an audition by Jay James, expertly flicking away her tears with windscreen wiper fingers. A week later, Cheryl is squeezing out some salty ones over Monica Michael’s performance. Why? Because Monica sang a song she had written about her sister — and this reminds our Chez of her own little sister, who apparently writes her poems, too. Episode five: Comeback queen and Essex girl Amy Connelly gets Cheryl's vote, but no one else is impressed . Episode nine: Time to pick who goes through to the judges' house round and the pressure is on . This time it’s double bubble: twin tracks from both eyes as our girl manages to somehow look stricken yet devout, like a nun who realises she has forgotten to wear her underpinnings to mass. Look at St Cheryl of the Snivellers, Our Lady of Sobs! Oh, it’s all getting too much. In episode five, she is welling up again as Amy Connelly sings the Whitney Houston classic, The Greatest Love Of All. What’s heated her gravy up this time? Perhaps someone has just told her that Bambi’s mother really did die, and she’s struggling to cope with that news in a very flattering, soft focus kind of way. Last weekend, the return of Monica Michael threw Cheryl into yet another tizzy. In this episode, she puts her hands over her damp eyes so often, cynics wonder if she’s just using her emotion as an excuse to flash her ginormous engagement ring. Stranger things have happened at sea. Speaking of which, the following night, Cheryl hoists the howling mainsail and climbs aboard the good ship Soggy Kleenex on her biggest voyage of tears to date. What on earth has happened now? Has somebody died? Even worse, has Simon cut her Christmas bonus? No. A young man from Italy called Andrea Faustini is wearing tragically turned-up jeans, bearing his patterned socks to the world. That’s enough to do it. Screaming blubs!! He is also singing rather nicely, which is what one would hope for in a singing contest, but somehow, this tips Cheryl into full diamond-ring-flashing, wrist-buckling meltdown, with Mel B joining in on sobby backing vocals. Later, in the arena auditions, a singer called Helen Fulthorpe makes Mel B have a deep weep, while an unusually dry-eyed Cheryl jokes to the bewildered singer that she ‘made Scary Spice cry’. Hark at her. People cry for different reasons. We cry because we feel sad and bad, we cry for all the suffering in the world, we cry because sometimes it’s the only human response that seems appropriate. Cheryl’s showbiz tears only serve to dilute real emotion and if she is like this with this Niagara of nobodies, what is she going to be like during the live finals? Meanwhile, the terrible news is that she has forecast stormy squalls of tears tonight. In the past, Cheryl has said the judges’ houses stage, where she personally has to tell her hand-picked contestants that their X Factor journey is over and send them home, is the most emotionally wrenching of all. For her, not them. Hankies aloft, you have been warned.","Cheryl Fernandez-Versini seems to burst into tears during every episode .

"A study found that those who ate raw garlic were significantly less likely to get lung cancer, even if they smoked . Eating raw garlic just twice a week can almost halve the risk of lung cancer, new research shows. A study carried out in China found adults regularly consuming raw garlic as part of their diet were 44 per cent less likely to suffer the disease. Even when researchers allowed for whether people smoked - the biggest single cause of lung cancer - they found garlic still seemed to reduce the dangers by around 30 per cent. Around 40,000 people a year are diagnosed with lung cancer in England and Wales alone. Smoking is thought to cause at least 80 per cent of cases and fewer than one in ten sufferers are still alive five years after their diagnosis. Previous studies have suggested garlic can protect the lungs against various conditions, as well as ward off other malignancies such as bowel cancer. One study at the University of South Australia suggested the popular herb could slash the risk of bowel tumours by nearly a third. In the latest investigation, scientists at Jiangsu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention compared 1,424 lung cancer patients with 4,500 healthy adults. Each one was quizzed on their dietary and lifestyle habits, including how often they consumed garlic and whether they smoked. The results, published online in the journal Cancer Prevention Research, showed those who ate raw garlic at least twice a week were significantly less likely to get lung cancer, even if they smoked or were exposed to high-temperature cooking oil fumes, thought to be another trigger for the disease. Around 40,000 people a year are diagnosed with lung cancer (pictured in red) in England and Wales alone. Smoking is thought to cause at least 80 per cent of cases and fewer than one in ten sufferers are still alive five years after their diagnosis . It's not clear whether cooked garlic would have the same effect. But previous research suggests the key ingredient seems to be a chemical called allicin, released when the clove is crushed or chopped. It is thought to dampen down inflammation in the body and act as an anti-oxidant, reducing damage from so-called free radicals to the body's cells. Other studies have found it may help ward off the common cold, hospital superbugs and even malaria. In a report on their findings the researchers said: 'Garlic may potentially serve as a preventive agent for lung cancer.'","Study found that eating raw garlic reduced the risk of lung cancer by 44% .

The watch was also calibrated so that Mr Graves could tell the time based on the exact position of the sun at his New York home. The watch features 24 horological complications - or features. They include a perpetual calendar, moon phases, a power reserve and an exact replica of the night sky as seen from Central Park in Manhattan, showing the exact position and magnitude of stars across the Milky Way. Tim Bourne, Sotheby's Worldwide Head of Watches, and Daryn Schnipper, Chairman of Sotheby's Watch Division, said of the watch: 'The list of superlatives which can be attached to this icon of the 20th century is truly extraordinary. 'Indisputably the 'Holy Grail' of watches, The Henry Graves Supercomplication combines the Renaissance ideal of the unity of beauty and craftsmanship with the apogee of science.' The Graves watch retained the title of the world's most complicated watch for 56 years and even then was only surpassed by technicians working with the aid of computer-assisted machines. In 1999 Sotheby's sold the Graves watch for £6.8 million, breaking the record for the most expensive timepiece ever sold at auction. Next month, to coincide with Patek Philippe's 175th anniversary, the watch is again being auctioned in Geneva by Sotheby's, who expect it to sell for over £10 million. A number of other Patek Philippe and Rolex watches will also be sold. Henry Graves was the son of Henry Graves Senior, a founder and partner in the Maxwell & Graves baking firm, and made millions of dollars in banking and the rail roads. As well as being an avid art collector, Mr Graves had a passion for fine watches, and was a patron of Patek Philippe. Henry Graves Junior commissioned the watch in 1925, after car manufacturer James Ward Packard sought to have the most complicated watch ever made - Mr Graves invested almost five times as much in his watch . The gold pocket watch was first commissioned in 1925 by banker Henry Graves Junior, who is considered the greatest watch collector of the 20th century, and took eight years to deliver . The timepiece, made by famed watchmaker Patek Philippe, is the most complex ever made without the use of computer technology . It was a competition with car manufacturer James Ward Packard, that saw him commission the Supercomplication pocket watch. In 1927 Mr Packard commissioned what he thought was going to be the most complicated watch ever made only be be trumped by Mr Graves who spent almost five times as much having his own custom watch created. After Mr Graves death in 1953, the watch was held in the Museum of Time near Chicago from 1968 until December 1999 when it was sold by Sotheby's to anonymous bidder in New York. Until Sotheby's again announced it had the famed timepiece for sale, it had been on display at the Patek Philippe Museum in Geneva.

"Coleen Rooney has seen off a bid to build 15 new homes overlooking her sprawling £5million neo-Georgian palace after saying the development would ‘ruin the village’. She complained to planning bosses saying the development - which included five affordable homes - would damage the ‘special landscape’ around the mansion she shares with Wayne in Cheshire. But the WAG has been accused of hypocrisy after she bulldozed the original 1930s Prestbury mansion and replaced it with 'Waynesor Castle' - complete with pink-interior swimming pool. She was backed by almost 60 neighbours, including former Manchester United defender Wes Brown's wife Leanne and ex-Slade rocker Noddy Holder's wife Suzan. Scroll down for video . Coleen Rooney objected to 'affordable' houses being built near to her eight-bedroom mansion in Prestbury . The proposals were rejected by Cheshire East Council’s planning committee on  Friday. In a letter, Mrs Rooney, 28, said: ‘Let’s not ruin our village. The development would be in direct conflict with the national policy to protect green belt land. 'The development will mean more car journeys into the village, which is already congested and unsuitable for the increased traffic. It will damage the special landscape, character and appearance of the area.’ The plans, put forward by Harvey Wood Investments, included five 'affordable' homes, with one of the builds visible from the end of her drive. Coleen, wife of England and Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney, wrote an angry letter to the council about the plans . Grecian columns and gold bath taps are said to grace the interior of the Rooney's house and the  20 acres of grounds are surrounded by high perimeter walls studded with security cameras. The three-storey mansion also boasts a swimming pool, Jacuzzi, gym, cinema. Richard Morris, a surveyor who advised developers Harvey Wood, says: ‘There is a contradiction. The Rooneys’ house is like a mini office building and it seems slightly strange that they should object to what is a very sympathetic development on adjoining land.’ Mrs Rooney grew up in rough area of Croxteth in Liverpool with a her mother who worked as a nursery nurse. The plans to build 15 new homes were rejected by Cheshire East Council's planning committee . The plans, put forward by Harvey Wood Investments, included five 'affordable' homes, with one of the builds visible from the end of Mrs Rooney's drive . Slade rocker Noddy Holder's wife Suzan also complained to the council, saying it was necessary to preserve the character of the historic village. The Holders are long-standing residents of Prestbury and live on the same secluded cul-de-sac as the Rooneys. Mrs Holder said: 'I can see no 'very special circumstances' that would be the only way to justify the destruction of this green belt area for the purpose of building any number of new houses. Prestbury is an historic village and we need to preserve its character and setting.' The Cheshire village, a few miles north of Macclesfield, is one of the richest places outside the South-East of England - part of a triangle of wealth formed with the nearby settlements of Wilmslow and Alderley Edge.

"A Florida officer was arrested Thursday for the alleged rape of a 20-year-old woman at gunpoint on duty, police said. Officer Stephen Maiorino, 35, is accused of demanding oral sex from his victim under threat of arrest and pinning her to the hood of his police cruiser while he sexually assaulted her. An eight-year veteran of Boynton Beach police who once starred in an episode TruTV's 'Most Shocking,' Maiorino met his victim after the driver of the car she was in was arrested for a DUI, the Sun Sentinel reports. Scroll down for video . Most shocking: Stephen Maiorino, 35, an eight-year veteran of Boynton Beach police who once starred in an episode of TruTV's Most Shocking, is accused of raping a woman at gunpoint . Maiorino was called to pick up the woman early on the evening of October 15 and take her to the police station, where family members were waiting, according to the police affidavit. When the two arrived at the station, Maiorino 'grabbed her wrist and told her to perform oral sex on him to avoid being arrested herself' for DUI 'even though she had done nothing wrong', she claims. The woman told investigators she complied out of fear, the affidavit goes on to state, but Maiorino still didn't let her go. He drove off to a secluded area in a field, and ordered the woman to strip before he pinned her down to the hood of the police cruiser with his right hand, she testified in the report. The victim said that during the alleged assault, she turned to look back to see Maiorino holding a gun in his left hand. Afterwards, as she got dressed, she said that Maiorino pointed the gun at her and threatened to kill and her family if she told anyone about the assault, according to the affidavit. Disturbed and disgusted: Boynton Beach Police Chief Jeffrey Katz said the department had suspended Maiorino and said he would be fired . Police received a complaint six hours later and began investigating the claim the next morning with the help of the woman. Investigators found a condom wrapper and condom allegedly used by Maiorino in the secluded area that the woman led them to. Police also reviewed radio communications from Maiorino and found 54 minutes elapsed between when he picked up the woman and when he dropped her off. At 6:36pm, he called over the radio saying he was bringing her to the police station, and at 7:30pm dropped her off, said police. The woman was originally stranded only 20 blocks from the station. Maiorino did not speak to investigators but consented to a DNA swab and handed over clothing, a police report said. Early testing indicates that DNA found on the condom, the condom wrapper and Maiorino's underwear matches that of the woman, the affidavit states. Maiorino, who records indicate is married, turned himself in on Thursday. Police Chief Jeffrey Katz said he is currently on administrative leave and 'will be fired.' The cop was also charged with armed sexual battery, armed kidnapping and unlawful compensation or reward for official behavior. 'I would like to say that I am both disturbed and disgusted by the nature of the complaint, the findings of the investigation, and indeed the very prospect that a law enforcement officer could possibly exploit this trust in such a vile and inexcusable way,' read a statement from Katz. A personnel file released by the city showed that Maiorino began having disciplinary problems starting in 2011. He was suspended for two days that year for unsatisfactory performance and for mishandling evidence. He was suspended again in 2012 for violating prisoner transport and pursuit policy. The department also noted his patrol car was also involved in several crashes, and earlier this year struck a fire hydrant.","Officer Stephen Maiorino, 35, surrendered to police and was arrested for armed sexual battery .

"A mother who suffocated her three disabled children before trying to kill herself was yesterday told she will not face trial for their murder. In the wake of the killings, Tania Clarence left a note for her husband, a wealthy banker, which read: ‘Gary, I don’t want to be saved please. I can’t live with the horror of what I have done.’ Prosecutors have now accepted that the 42-year-old was overwhelmed by depression when she killed her four-year-old daughter Olivia and three-year-old twins Ben and Max, and wanted ‘a way out of their joint suffering’. No trial: Tania Clarence, has admitted killing her twins three-year-old sons Max and Ben (pictured with father Gary) and their older sister Olivia, four, but will not face a murder trial , a judge said today . She has pleaded guilty to their manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Now having psychiatric treatment, Clarence is said to ‘bitterly regret’ her children’s deaths. Although his wife did not appear in court, Mr Clarence, 43, a director with City bank Investec, attended the short hearing, but made no comment. Clarence, 42, (who attended an earlier court hearing under the cover of a coat, above) had killed her children 'to end their suffering', the prosecution said today . A neighbour said yesterday that Mr Clarence was supporting his wife in hospital, adding: ‘They are still very fond of each other. He told a neighbour they loved each other to pieces.’ Another neighbour said Mr Clarence visited his wife every day. Accepting the mother’s plea, the Crown Prosecution Service agreed that Clarence was ‘unable to form a rational judgment’ at the time of the killings. Bereft: Her husband Gary Clarence (pictured at the Old Bailey today) was in South Africa with the couple's eldest child when the deaths occurred . Prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC told the Old Bailey: ‘Although the term “mercy killing” has no legal or psychiatric definition, it is clear Mrs Clarence killed her three children because she wanted to end their suffering. ‘At the time she committed the act she could not see any alternative or any other way out of their joint suffering – both her suffering and the suffering of her children.’ All three children had type 2 spinal muscular atrophy, a degenerative muscle-wasting condition, which usually leaves sufferers unable to stand or walk unaided. It does not affect the mind, meaning children of normal intelligence are trapped in weak bodies and face progressive loss of control over movement and mobility. Most sufferers live into their teenage years or adulthood, according to charities. Olivia was diagnosed with the condition while Clarence was pregnant with the twins, who were then diagnosed after birth. Clarence, who is originally from South Africa, gave up her job as a graphic designer to care for the children, and the family spent around £1million on their £2million home in New Malden, south-west London, equipping it with a lift and ramps. Neighbour Joy Devis, 87, said they had seemed ‘a very happy little family’, despite the children’s disabilities. At the time of the killings, Mr Clarence was in South Africa visiting relatives with the couple’s eldest child, now eight, who does not suffer from the condition. After the children’s nanny and a neighbour became concerned when they didn’t see any activity at the five-bedroom home, they found Clarence weeping and bleeding from her wrist in an upstairs bedroom. She had left a series of notes in the house, including one in Afrikaans warning her husband not to allow their daughter into the children’s bedrooms, where their bodies were found. Police were called and she immediately confessed to the killings, telling an officer: ‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry ... I killed them. I suffocated them.’ Clarence’s lawyer Jim Sturman QC told the court: ‘This is a truly tragic case. Anybody who reads the evidence cannot fail to be moved. ‘This offending did occur while Mrs Clarence was suffering from an abnormality of the mind. ‘She was manifesting stress throughout the life of the children with the pain they were suffering. ‘Caring for three children in that condition was exhausting, distressing, debilitating and turned out to be overwhelming, and Mrs Clarence couldn’t see any hope for the future and any way of continuing. ‘Now she bitterly regrets her actions, the deaths of the three children and the impact upon her surviving daughter, who is cared for by Mr Clarence.’ Clarence is due to be sentenced next month. Admission: Clarence, pictured in a prison van, confessed to the triple killing to a female police officer at the scene, saying: 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry.' Asked why she was sorry, she said: 'I killed them. I suffocated them' The bodies of the children were found at the couple's £2million family home (above) in New Malden, south-west London, on April 22. All three were in their pyjamas in bed and are believed to have been smothered to death .","Tania Clarence, 42, admitted manslaughter of her three disabled children .

"For years, Bridget Harris had listened intently to her mother's stories about her late grandfather's experiences in World War II - but during their last conversation, there was one titbit she'd never heard before. After surviving the D-Day assault in Normandy, her grandfather, Staff Sgt. Paul T. Lipari, had left Europe with a secret stash of souvenirs - including images of Adolf Hitler as a young man. 'Wait. What?' Harris, a photo editor at Time, wrote in an article for LIFE.com. 'My ears pricked up... Snapshots of Hitler? Now this was a story I hadn't heard before.' Harris sat in amazement as her mother fetched the never-before-seen pictures, which had been stored in a box with other photos, maps and letters upstairs in her parents' California home. Scroll down for video . Discovery: Time photo editor and producer Bridget Harris found a stash of photographs of Hitler as a young man in her parents' home during a recent trip. This one is captioned: 'The Führer is a friend to animals' The images - Nazi propaganda - attempt to depict Hitler as a kind and respected leader. In one image, he pets a fawn with the caption: 'The Führer is a friend to animals.' Another shows him shaking hands with grinning workers, while another shows him meeting wounded SA soldiers. An even earlier image shows him alongside comrades at  hospital in Berlitz. Hitler had spent almost two months at the hospital after being hit by a shell in the Battle of the Somme in October 1916. There were also photos showing waving supporters at rallies and children marching in the street as part of the Hitler Youth. Younger years: Hitler is pictured back row, second from right during his stay in the hospital in Berlitz. He was treated there for two months after suffering injuries from an explosion during the Battle of the Somme . Celebration: Hitler is pictured in an airplane on his birthday in 1932. Harris said she learned the photos were part of a set that supporters would collect by using coupons found in cigarette packets . 'Man of the people': Another image in the collection shows him greeting workers . Harris discovered that each photo came with a patriotic caption. 'Drums which call German freedom,' one image of a parade read. 'Chancellor and workers hand in hand,' another says. The photos are rare because, after 1945, German governments enforced a law making it illegal to deal in Nazi propaganda and literature - leaving few collections like this behind. The images had been taken for a cigarette picture book entitled 'Germany Awakes: The Growth, Struggle and Victory of the NSDAP', Harris reported. Most of the photographs were made by Heinrich Hoffmann, the official photographer of the National Socialist German Worker’s Party. The party collaborated with the German Cigarette Picture Service to work on the collection. They prepared books containing  text and empty spaces for the photos, and smokers would then find coupons for the images inside their cigarette packages. They would send the coupon to the company and, in return, get the photos. Leader: Hitler (pictured in the 1930s in an image not found in the collection) appeared on the cards for Nazi propaganda, but after his fall, it was illegal to trade the images - making them extremely rare in Germany . 'In effect, Third Reich trading cards,' Harris wrote. Her article explains that soldiers have long been 'liberating' souvenirs from foreign lands, but she has many unanswered questions about the images found by her grandfather, who died 15 years ago. 'If my grandfather were alive today, I would have so many questions to ask him,' she wrote. 'Where did he find these cards? What caused him to pause and pick them up, and why did he bring them back home? 'I can't help but wonder if he shared the same instinct that I have when I come across pictures like these: namely, a deep curiosity, as well as a desire to know more and to share that knowledge.' Her full article and photo gallery can be seen at Life.com.","Time photo editor Bridget Harris was shocked when her mother mentioned images of Hitler that her late grandfather had brought back from Germany .

It was really hard. 'I couldn't imagine a world without Cass. I mean, she'd done so much for me.' Cass Nascimento's cancer returned on the same day Carrasco was cleared . Every day for two years, Nascimento would visit him and through it, they formed a special bond . Nascimento was 16-years-old when she had three brain operations, chemotherapy and radiation but despite her own battles, she wanted to share her experience and help give Carrasco strength. 'Personally I didn’t find this strength on my own. It was the quality that grew from my support network and my friendship with Cass,' he posted on Mamamia. 'It was that text message asking how I was; it was those countless hours she spent with me holding my hand reassuring that this too would pass.' 'She would say things like ‘I wish I could take your pain’ but her presence made me feel invincible. Anything was possible as long as we were together,' he told Sunday Night. Appearing on Channel Seven’s Sunday Night on Sunday, Carrasco reveals the heartbreaking story of an inspiring girl who lost her battle . Cass Nascimento had relapsed with another brain tumour and sadly passed away in November last year . The pair decided to film their journey together 'in the hope people could form relationships like ours through their own battles' Despite their cancer battle, Carrasco revealed he had always appreciated Nascimento from afar and told all his friends that she's the 'hot girl' but  was too shy to approach her. 'She was one of those girls who you could never talk to face-to-face because she was too hot,' he told Sunday Night. But since her death, Carrasco said she had 'touched many people's lives' and her 'experiences will go on to help others'. 'I thank you for everything you’ve ever done for me. I am so sorry, Cass, I couldn’t save you like you saved me. I really am.' Nascimento wanted to share her experience with Carrasco (pictured) when he was battling cancer . The pair became ambassadors in a bid to build cancer wards for young adults between 16-24 in Australia . The pair decided to film their journey together 'in the hope people could form relationships like ours through their own battles'. Nascimento said in one footage before: 'Being diagnosed and going through everything, kind of learned that life's so short and you could be gone at any moment. While children are treated in their own cancer wards, Nascimento revealed how difficult it was when the pair were treated alongside older patients. But two years ago, the pair became ambassadors for the Sony Foundation's youth cancer program, You Can, in a bid to build cancer wards for young adults between 16-24 in Australia. The first You Can Cancer Centre opened at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth a year ago. Nascimento went to America for an experimental treatment but in October last year, she collapsed after a scan revealed the cancer had spread throughout her brain . The pair decided to film their journey together 'in the hope people could form relationships like ours through their own battles' Nascimento went to America for an experimental treatment but in October last year, she collapsed after a scan revealed the cancer had spread throughout her brain. The doctors told her family and friends that she didn't have much longer to live and she lost her brave battle at 19 on November 11, 2013. 'Towards the end Cass couldn't do much and I wanted to make her laugh, make her feel better,' he told Sunday Night. 'She used to say to me that, every night she would hear her mum in her room crying and that she never used to say anything or never used to complain because she loved her mum so much that she didn't want her mum to be in anymore pain. 'I honestly believe the reason why Cass was the way she was, and dealt with everything was because of the example her mother set for her. 'With my battle over, now I just want all young people to have the chance to be that Cass for someone. To save other people lives, just like Cass saved mine,' he told Mamamia.

"The photographs taken by a British explorer that ignited worldwide debate over the existence of the Yeti in the Himalayas are to be auctioned. During the 1951 Everest expedition, Eric Earle Shipton CBE used an ice pick to give the footprints in the snow at the Memluk Basin some scale. The footprints measure between 12 and 13 inches long. The photographs came more than 25 years after photographer and member of the Royal Geographic Society N.A. Tombazi claimed to have made the first European sighting of the mythical beast. Eric Shipton used an ice pick to give scale to the footprint, which some believe to be that of a Yeti, captured during a 1951 Everest expedition; the picture is part of a set being auctioned . The collection of photographs taken by Mr Shipton, and an envelope which states they are pictures of the 'abominable snow man's feet' He wrote: 'Unquestionably, the figure in outline was exactly like a human being, walking upright and stopping occasionally to pull at some dwarf rhododendron bushes. 'It showed up dark against the snow, and as far as I could make out, wore no clothes.' Mr Shipton's photographs are part of Christie's ‘Out of the Ordinary: The Online Edit’ auction which will run until September 10. They are being sold for between £2 and £3,000. Since the photographs were taken critics, paranormal investigators and academics have scrutinised and debated their authenticity. A climbing boot is used to give the footprint, believed to measure between 12 and 13 inches, scale . This picture, which shows footprints leading up the mountain, is part of the Christie's auction called Out of the Ordinary: The Outline Edit, which runs until September 10 . One of the Everest expedition group is pictured during the 1951 ascent; the images are being auctioned for between £2 and £3,000 . Some claim Mr Shipton’s photographs offer the best evidence yet of the Yeti’s existence, while others suggest the footprints belong to a known creature and were elongated by melting snow. There was a further potential encounter with the Yeti by Sir Edmund Hilary, the first man to scale Mount Everest, in 1952 on a pass between the Ngojumba and Khumbu glaciers. In his book, Hillary, High Adventure, Sir Edmund wrote that his group were climbing a steep pitch when one of the party found a 'tuft of long black hairs'. Sir Edmund said it was 'thick and coarse' and looked more like 'bristles than anything else'. Sir Edmund Hillary, pictured here with his sherpa Tenzing Norgay, once wrote of finding what some in his expedition group thought was a tuft of Yeti hair, and later returned to Everest to find further proof . The men who made the discovery, were certain of what it was, calling out  'Yeti, Sahib! Yeti!'. Sir Edmund wrote: 'I couldn’t help being impressed by their conviction, and it did seem a strange place to find some hair. 'We were well over 19,000 feet and the Abominable Snowman was obviously no mean rock climber.' In 1960 Sir Edmund mounted an expedition to collect and evaluate evidence of the Yeti's existence, but it proved inconclusive. Last year, British climber Mike Rees, 73, took a photograph of a footprint in the Himalayas and Yeti experts believe it offered further proof of the creature’s existence. This is the second time Mr Shipton's photographs have been offered for sale. They sold at auction in London in 2007 for £3,500. Mr Shipton was a distinguished British Himalayan mountaineer who explored Africa and the Himalayas throughout his life. He died in England in 1977, age 69, after falling ill during an expedition in Bhutan the previous year. 1832: A book on trekker B.H Hodgon's experiences in Nepal recalls the sighting of a tall, bipedal creature covered in long dark hair.

"Its devotees emerge dripping with sweat, exhilarated after a challenging workout in searing heat. But new evidence suggests that Bikram, and other types of hot yoga, is no better for you than normal yoga. And worse, for its many fans who believe it helps them lose weight, it doesn't burn any more calories than traditional yoga. Bikram or other hot yoga, which is performed in rooms heated up to a sweltering 40.6C/105F, may not burn more flab than regular yoga, a new study has claimed . A new study at an American . university has found that while performing hot yoga is not harmful if . done properly, it does not make the body work harder than any other type . of yoga. Dr Cedric Bryant, chief science officer of the American Council on Exercise (ACE) said: 'The benefits are largely perceptual. 'People think the degree of sweat is the quality of the workout, but that's not reality. 'It doesn't correlate to more calories.' ACE sponsored a small study at the . University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, in which researchers who monitored . two dozen healthy adults during regular and hot yoga classes found no . difference in the increase in core temperature or heart rate between the . two 60-minute sessions. Dr Bryant said that people enjoyed hot yoga because it allowed them to feel more flexible. But . as far as physical benefits, including muscular strength, endurance, . flexibility and balance, you can get those from a standard yoga class,' he said. Celebrities including Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow, left, and Coleen Rooney, right, have practised Bikram yoga . He added: 'An increase in core temperature would suggest the person is storing heat, and depending on how high, would be at risk for heat injury. 'We didn't find that.' For the study, the hot yoga was conducted in an average temperature of 33C (92F). Bryant said in classes, including the popular Bikram style, where the temperature rises to 105 Fahrenheit (40.5 Celsius) or higher, further study is needed. 'Many folks want to know what happens in that really extreme class,' he said. 'Our study says you don't have to be at those extreme temperatures to get all those benefits.' 'Evidence on the scales after a Bikram yoga class can be mistaken for fat burn rather than fluid loss but the sweating alone does not burn fat.' - Claire Finlay, founder of London's Transition Zone studio . Doing yoga in temperatures of up to . 40.5C (105F) or higher is increasingly popular, and has been practised . by celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow, Madonna, Coleen Rooney and . Wimbledon winner Andy Murray. Its fans believe that exercising at such high temperatures forces the body to work harder, and the sight of the sweat dripping off them encourages the belief they are burning the flab. London yoga teacher and personal trainer Claire Finlay, who runs the Transition Zone studio in south-west London, agrees with the findings of the study. She said: 'To burn calories, your body requires oxygen. The harder the exercise, the more oxygen you require and the harder you breathe. 'Your heart may need to work a little harder to keep your muscles oxygenated (and to cool the body down) in a Bikram class, but this would be no different than in many other yoga classes particularly a dynamic Power yoga session, which can be quite cardio-driven and very hot and sweaty. 'Evidence on the scales after a Bikram yoga class can be mistaken for fat burn rather than fluid loss, but the sweating alone does not burn fat. 'If it did, we could all sit in the sauna and melt away the fat.' Lifestyle guru Bikram Choudhury, 67,  invented the eponymous Bikram yoga in which poses (which he's trademarked) are held in high temperatures . Devised by and named after . 67-year-old Bikram Choudhury, Bikram yoga is based on regular hatha yoga, but . performed in sweltering temperatures and with a high (40 per cent) degree of humidity. Its fans claim that not only does it . leave them stronger and more flexible than standard yoga, it also helps . them shed weight fast. Choudhury began practising yoga in Calcutta at the age of four, spending up to six hours a day perfecting his poses. At 13 he won the National India Yoga Championship and went on to devise the 26 'asanas' (poses) and two breathing methods that form the core of Bikram yoga. In 1973 President Nixon invited Choudhury to the US to help him improve his health, and soon Nixon was the darling of American celebrities, with clients including Michael Jackson and Madonna. Bikram copyrighted his 26 poses and franchised his exercise methods, and the craze spread from America's West Coast to the UK in 2000, when Brit Michele Pernetta set up the country's first Bikram studio in north London. Choudhury says Bikram works because the 40C/105F heat loosens the muscles, helping them to go further than they would otherwise. Yogis perform the series of poses, pushing their bodies to the limit, and are encouraged to drink vast quantities of water to replace that lost by sweat. Teachers say that if it gets too much for they, they should lie on the floor or leave the room for lower temperatures. New York hot yoga teacher Taj Harris said: 'People like to sweat, they enjoy the way their body feels after a nice heated stretch. 'I have had the pleasure of watching some students work through tightness, strains and pains with a regular hot yoga practice.' Students, who carry a towel to mop up their sweat, are taught to watch out for danger signs including nausea, lightheadedness and dizziness.","US university research shows physical benefits same as in regular yoga .

"Amazon is launching a new same day pick up service allowing customers who order before 11.45am to pick up their parcels from local newsagents from 4pm . Amazon is launching a new attack on traditional high street stores from today with its first ever same day pick-up service. Shoppers who order an item before 11.45am  will be able to collect it from 4pm onwards at any one of 500 named newsagents and convenience stores. The new ‘Pass My Parcel’ service will initially be free to subscribers to the Amazon Prime service, while others will have to pay £4.99. Traditional bricks and mortar stores have been under unprecedented attack from web retailers, who have been able to undercut them on price because they have much lower costs. Until now, the high street has had one key advantage in that shoppers could make an instant purchase, while people using the web had the expense and delay involved in waiting for a delivery. However, Amazon believes it has been able to overcome this hurdle with the same day service. Workers who need something urgently, perhaps a birthday present for a loved one, will be sure they arrive home with the item without having to leave their desks to browse the shops. There is also an ‘Express Morning’ service which will  allow shoppers to order an item at any time up to 7.45pm in the evening with the option of picking it up at some time between 6am and 9am the following morning. It might be a new dress or tie for an important business meeting or essentials needed for a sunshine holiday. Customers are notified by email when the item is ready for collection and they are given a unique code which authorises the store to hand it over. The service is being offered in a collaboration with Smiths News and will utilise its fleet of vans which normally deliver newspaper and magazines to tens of thousands of retailers across the UK. Initially, the Amazon same day service will be available from 500 stores which will carry the ‘Pass My Parcel’ banner in their shop windows, but it is likely to be rolled out to many more. Amazon already offers shoppers the option to collect purchases from any one of 6,000 points, including stores carrying the Collect + logo and secure Amazon Lockers, but orders generally take a day or so to fulfil. It is thought the move could draw more customers away from the high street and into online shopping . Christopher North, Amazon’s UK managing director, said: ‘This is our fastest pick-up service yet. ‘We know that Prime customers love fast delivery and the convenience to pick up their order at a time and place that suits them best. This new service brings together both of those great benefits.’ He added: ‘We have recently added Birmingham International Airport and a number of London tube stations to our ever-expanding list of pick-up locations. ‘Our intention is to keep rapidly adding to the many thousands of existing pick-up locations to ensure that customers all over the UK are provided with as much choice as possible when it comes to the delivery of their Amazon order.’ Mark Cashmore, Group Chief Executive, of Connect Group, said: ‘We are delighted to be working with Amazon at the launch of Pass my Parcel. ‘Because we visit thousands of local retailers every day, we are uniquely placed to deliver a twice daily pick up service that is second to none in speed and convenience.’ The online firm will despatch parcels from one of its warehouse centres to any of 500 newsagents around the country from today . The same day collection service will be free to subscribers to Amazon Prime, which costs £79 a year, until the end of this year. Prime members also get free one-day delivery on over seven million items, access to 500,000 Kindle books to borrow and unlimited streaming of more than 15,000 movies and TV episodes through Prime Instant Video. The ability to offer same day delivery is the Holy Grail for web stores. In the USA, the company has launched the AmazonFresh in some cities, which offers the same day delivery of fresh and frozen groceries. There are long-standing rumours that the company wants to bring the service to this country. The vice president of Amazon UK is Doug Gurr, who previously ran Asda’s food home shopping service. He has hinted at the expansion of AmazonFresh, saying: ‘We have just started rolling that out across America. ‘Our model tends to be to take something and to try really hard to make it work and then, when we think we have got it right, start rolling it out.’ This week Google announced it is expanding a delivery service for online purchases in the USA which is called ‘Google Express’. Google will charge $10 a month, or $95 a year, for unlimited same-day or overnight delivery on orders over $15. Non-members will pay $4.99 an order, or $7.99 if the order costs less than $15. Google Express, lets customers place orders online for products from physical stores run by retailers including Costco , Staples and Walgreen. The service, which initially covered parts of San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York is being extend to Washington, D.C., Boston and Chicago.","Website will send parcels ordered in the morning to convenience stores .

"A 67-year-old piano tuner who has worked for Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett is fighting to keep a beach house owned by his late parents against organizers of a major Atlantic City development who are trying to tear down. Charlie Birnbaum has refused a buyout from the state agency in charge of redeveloping the ailing resort city's shrinking casino industry. The 93-year-old home sits down the street from the failed $2.4 billion Revel Hotel Casino, which will close for good this weekend. The state agency hope to transform the casino and its surrounds into a  a two-and-a-half-block tourism district, but need to purchase the properties currently sitting on the land, including Birnbaum's. Scroll down for video . Not without a fight: Charlie Birnbaum, 67, who turned his love for the piano into a job tuning pianos in Atlantic City's casinos, is fighting the state's attempt to take his home in the shadows of the failed Revel Casino Hotel through eminent domain . Failed: Charlie Birnbaum on the roof of the home where he was raised in Atlantic City, N.J., near the Revel Casino Hotel, which will close this weekend . Rdevelopment: The three-story brick home where Charlie Birnbaum was raised (center) is seen Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2014. The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority wants to take the home where Birnbaum parents lived, and where his mother was killed, even though the Revel casino is closing next week . The three-story brick house belonged to his holocaust survivor parents and represents a great deal of family sentimentality. 'This building gave (my father) dignity. It was his refuge,' Birnbaum said. 'As it was for my mom when my dad passed away. Because of this building, my dad didn't die in a nursing home.' Not even the killing of his mother there during a 1998 robbery diminished Birnbaum's beautiful memories of what the house meant for his family. It's those memories that keep him from accepting a buyout. Even with the hulking glass structure down the street preparing to sit empty after Revel closes this weekend, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority says it still wants to redevelop the nearby land where Birnbaum's house sits. Birnbaum's lawyer and an attorney representing other tenants affected by the redevelopment plans met Thursday with a judge who is deciding whether the CRDA has the right to force them out through eminent domain. The judge heard arguments from both sides in May and scheduled another hearing for October 6. Though Birnbaum does not live at the house, he still goes there almost daily. He uses the first floor for his business tuning pianos played in the city's casinos, and to play the piano still in the living room, which is surrounded by pictures of his family. 'The building has been my refuge in a similar way,' he said. 'I've been able to continue making a living and doing what I do.' Clientele: Charlie Birnbaum taught himself how to tune pianos as a child and went on to work with numerous stars in Atlantic City, including Frank Sinatra (pictured here in 1954) The building is one of a few inhabited properties that dot the landscape, surrounded by patches of grass and undeveloped lots with for-sale signs. His parents, Holocaust survivors, bought the house in 1969 for $13,000 when Birnbaum was in college, and he still rents out its two apartments. According to The New York Times, Birnbaum's parents were Polish Jews who escaped the Nazis by hiding out in forests and joining the partisans. His mother, Dora, lost her first husband and a three-year-old daughter to Nazi slaughter, and his father, Abe, lost his wife. The pair married and in July 1944 Dora gave birth to the couple's first son, Sam, who she delivered herself during the war. The family moved to San Francisco to live with a relative in 1952 before relocating to Philadelphia. When Birnbaum suffered a psychotic breakdown while studying music at Temple University, his father decided to move the family to Atlantic City, buying the home at 311 Oriental Avenue in 1969 for $13,000. Robert McNamara, an attorney representing Birnbaum from the Virginia-based Institute of Justice, said the CRDA doesn't have any concrete plans to redevelop the area and is out to 'destroy Charlie's family home'. 'They're just moving forward no matter what to create more vacant land in Atlantic City,' McNamara said. Determined: Charlie Birnbaum said his commitment to keeping his Atlantic City house was to honor his parents . Elaine Zamansky, a spokeswoman for the redevelopment agency, said she couldn't comment on Birnbaum's case, but that the agency is 'accumulating land that makes it attractive for developers to buy'. The opening of Revel two years ago had inspired plans for the surrounding South Inlet area, including a $75 million entertainment complex proposed by a group that includes former NBA star Shaquille O'Neal. The CRDA had planned to use its share of revenue from Revel — 1.25 percent of gambling winnings — to pay for a $50 million bond to buy and clear several blocks. But Revel's struggles led the agency to use a more modest $8.5 million to remake the neighborhood. Birnbaum, who lives 30 miles inland in Hammonton and has made a living by tuning pianos at the casinos for Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and others, said he was offered fair market value for his family's house, about $240,000. He said he would leave if he was given a detailed reason on what the city wants to do with the land. 'I was hoping that my parents would see some turnaround and some progress, and now I'm hoping and praying that I'll be the one that sees the turnaround and progress in spite of Revel and in spite of Showboat and (Trump) Plaza, because we've gone through some tough times,' he said. 'And if it means going through more tough times, so be it.'","Charlie Birnbaum, 67, was a piano tuner in Atlantic City, working for the likes of Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett .

"Winger Teddy Thomas scored a hat-trick on his international debut to help France overwhelm Fiji 40-15 on Saturday, the hosts running in five tries to restore confidence ahead of a sterner test against Australia. Flyhalf Camille Lopez scored 13 points as France ended a four-game losing streak including a disastrous summer tour of Australia in which they were whitewashed by the Wallabies. France were quickly into their stride with a try in the opening minute after turning over possession. Lopez's cross-kick to the corner was caught by Thomas, who touched down for his first international try. Teddy Thomas made the perfect start to his international career, scoring just a minute into his debut . The new France winger had a debut to remember, running in three tries against a powerful Fijian side . Three penalties by Lopez took France into halftime 14-0 ahead, highlighting their dominance as the Fijians struggled to create a scoring chance. 'The players were able to let themselves go without asking too many questions, which is what you need to do in games like this,' French captain Thierry Dusautoir told broadcaster France 2. 'The level will be a lot higher next week, but we can be satisfied with what we did tonight.' Despite the comfortable final score line, Fiji came out with more bite in second half and converted a penalty before lock Leone Nakarawa burst past Thomas and fed Alipate Ratini to cross the line. But the Fijian fightback galvanised a French team driven forward by South African-born fullback Scott Spedding who twice set up Thomas to score. Damien Chouli and Pascal Pape combine to stop Manasa Saulo as France took complete control . Nicola Mas rumbles forward during a performance which captain Thierry Dusautoir described as only the start . Fiji perform their haka before the game, but they scarcely troubled their hosts in the first period . 'I am French,' Spedding told France 2. 'I hope there are a lot more nights like tonight.' Pascal Pape dived over in the 67th minute after a well-worked French maul and Wesley Fofana crowned the victory four minutes with his 10th try for his country after a clever chip over the top by substitute Remi Tales. Fijian replacement Timoci Nagusa scored a memorable converted consolation in the dying seconds, running almost the length of the pitch to take the South Pacific islanders into double figures. Timoci Nagusa goes over for his excellent try but it was only a consolation for Fiji in Marseille . The win will be a relief for France manager Philippe Saint-Andre France who has come underfire after a string of poor performances amid concerns he is failing to find the right blend with less than a year until the World Cup. France face Australia at the Stade de France on Nov 15 and Argentina on Nov 22, also in Paris.","Teddy Thomas begins scoring with first minute try .

"Receiving a bouquet of flowers at work is one of the top five most desired gestures . Surprises may be the key to everyday happiness, according to new research. Two thirds (64 per cent) of Britons say thoughtful gestures make their day. And more than half (51 per cent) say that when someone does something nice for them, it makes them feel loved. The nation's top five surprises include being cooked for, being made a cup of tea and a surprise note or letter left under a pillow. More than two fifths (43 per cent) believe it puts them in a good mood for hours, and a quarter of us (27 per cent) say it has a 'pass it on' effect on us. We feel the urge to do something good and make a surprise gesture for someone else as a result. Even just a surprise mug of tea can evoke the same feelings of positivity and happiness as a grand gesture like an extravagant gift. Eight in ten (81 per cent) of the population say they would feel just as pleased with a warm cup of tea. Professor Neil Frude, consultant clinical psychologist at The Happiness Consultancy.co.uk, commented on the findings. 'Psychologists have studied the positive effect of pleasant surprises for many years,' he said. 'What they have found is that when something delightful and unexpected happens it gives people a real boost. 'Pleasant surprises have a biological effect, a psychological effect and a social effect. 'And because emotional states are contagious, when a surprise makes someone happy then their friends, family and colleagues also benefit, so a surprise for one person really can 'spread a little happiness'.' The survey also revealed that we're a generous nation. More than three quarters of people (77 per cent) have received a surprise in the last six months, with the majority coming from romantic partners. Furthermore, two thirds (65 per cent) have performed a spontaneous gesture for someone 'just because' during the last month, proving you don't have to wait for an occasion to give a special surprise. Someone completing a household chore before you come home from work is also popular . 1) Someone cooking a surprise meal when I get home from work (24 per cent) 2) Being made an unexpected cup of tea on a bad day (17 per cent) 3) A surprise note or letter tucked into a bag, or under a pillow (16 per cent) 4) Someone completing a household chore for me before I come home from work (15 per cent) 5) Receiving a bouquet of flowers at work (11 per cent) When it comes to giving, 45 per cent said that performing a spontaneous gesture for someone makes them feel good with a further 40 per cent saying it makes them feel like they have done their good deed for the day. Nearly half (45 per cent) of people also said they felt happier giving treats rather than receiving them (12 per cent). However, it's not all good news. One in five (20 per cent) admit a lack of desire to take part in any spontaneous gestures, so it comes as no surprise that a third of us believe nice gestures are on the decline compared to a decade ago. The majority of people attribute this decline to the pressure people feel to spend money on expensive gestures, a lack of time and laziness. The survey of over 2,000 people comes as the world's largest flower delivery network, Interflora, launches a partnership with ITV's Surprise Surprise, which will see Mark Wright hand deliver  bouquets to deserving loved ones across the UK from October 22. The Surprise Someone Special campaign gives people the chance to recommend a friend or family member to receive a surprise visit from Mark and be presented with an Interflora bouquet by visiting www.interflora.co.uk/surprise during September.

"One of China's leading film directors is being investigated for allegedly fathering seven children, violating the country's strict policy of one child per family. Zhang Yimou, who directed the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is said to be facing a 160million yuan fine (£17million) for having children from his two marriages and two further relationships. Online reports of the breach this week have led to the authorities investigating the filmmaker, who directed the 2011 film The Flowers of War, starring Christian Bale. Zhang Yimou is accused of fathering seven children with four women and is under investigation by Chinese authorities . The celebrated filmmaker, pictured with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica at the 2012 Marrakech International Film Festival, could face a fine of 160million yuan (£17million) 'We are trying to confirm the online . rumors,' said a woman at Wuxi city's family . planning committee, a department under the municipal government in eastern Jiangsu province. The woman, who would not be named, said she couldn't reveal any other information until . authorities had finished investigating. Social media users in China criticised . Zhang and drew distinctions between how the ruling Communist Party . treats the elite and ordinary people. 'However many children a person has is . their basic right, but in a twisted society, basic rights have become a . privilege,' Beijing resident Liu Weiling, who works for a media . company, wrote on Sina Weibo. 'Why is China unable to win the world's respect?' asked author Christopher Jing. 'Rich people with groups of mistresses, old celebrities changing wives, Zhang Yimou getting so many privileges. Zhang masterminded the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which began with spectacular fireworks over the Bird's Nest stadium . 'Four women and seven kids, if this . was an ordinary person they would have killed you or fined you an . unreasonable amount of money, but he is fine ... he is no better than . ordinary people, such an unfair world will never gain respect.' Zhang's film credits also include A . Simple Noodle Story, an adaptation of the Coen brothers' 1984 movie . Blood Simple, and Under the Hawthorn Tree, a love story set in China's . decade-long, ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution. His film Ju Dou was the first film from mainland China to be nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign Language movie in 1990. Zhang's Los Angeles-based agent has not responded to requests for comment. The Oscar-nominated director counts the Flowers of War, starring Christian Bale, among his credits . The Flowers of War, set during the Second Sino-Japanese War, was nominated for a Golden Globe . Earlier today, the website of the People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, said Zhang's second wife, former actress Chen Ting, was from Wuxi. China's one-child policy applies to most urban couples. Rural families are allowed two children if their first-born is a girl. The government introduced the policy in 1979 as a temporary measure to curb a surging population, but it is still in place despite being reviled by many citizens.","Zhang Yimou directed the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics .

"A wedding ring accidentally dumped into a trick or treater's candy bag on Halloween has miraculously been found and returned to its rightful owner. When children from the Chicago suburb Naperville voraciously dug through their Halloween candy they noticed an item that wasn't quite like the others. The Carlin children had been trick or treating in their uncle's town of Plainfield where worried resident Jennifer Vasek was desperately searching for her wedding ring after accidentally dropping it into a candy bag. Found: Jennifer Vasek's diamond wedding ring was returned to her after a kind family from a neighboring Chicago suburb spotted it in their Halloween candy . Returned the treat: David Carlin and his sweet kids returned the Wedding ring to a tearful and overjoyed Vasek the next day after they spotted her fliers reporting her ring had been missing . 'At first, I thought it might be a toy ring,' David Carlin, who works for the state treasurer's office, told the Chicago Tribune. 'I took a photo of it and text-messaged my brother, saying we're going to want to come trick-or-treating in your neighborhood every year from now on.' Carlin told the Chicago Tribune that he enlisted the help of his two daughters aged 6 and 8 in solving the mystery of the ring. 'The girls immediately got very excited about the prospect of solving the mystery,' he said. Over in Plainfield,Vasek noticed the diamond inlaid band of her wedding band was missing right before she hopped into the shower that night. Jennifer Vasek and her husband Joe celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary on October 23 just days before. 'I'd been giving out handfuls of candy,' said Jennifer Vasek. 'I knew my ring was a little loose, but not to the extent that it might fall off.' Vasek reported her ring missing to Plainfield police and the next day the Carlins made flyers to post around the town in the hopes they would find the owner of the ring. 'We woke up the next morning, made fliers on the computer, printed them off and jumped in the car to go out there,' Carlin said. While they were on the way to post their signs David Carlin's brother who lives in Vasek's town saw a saw a sign  saying, 'Lost, wedding ring in trick-or-treat bag.' Carlin's brother text messaged him of a sign the Vaseks posted and he called Vasek straight way. Married: Joe and Jennifer Vasek celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary just one week before Halloween . 'I pulled off to the side of the road, called the number and told her: 'We have your ring.' All she said was ""I'm going to cry!"" ' Vasek said she was extremely grateful and was in tears when her ring was returned. 'I was in such joy and shock, I did not find out more information ... as I would like to thank them in some way,” she wrote. 'We always hear about so many negative things happening in today’s world, I really wanted to spread this positive, as I am truly blessed by this awesome selfless family,' Vasek told the Plainfield Patch. Vasek tried to give them a reward but the Carlins would not accept. 'Her reaction was the best part of all of this,' Carlin said. 'It lets you know you did the right thing.' Carlin said he believes in Karma and paying it forward. He referenced a woman from Mesa, Arizona who lost her wedding ring but has yet to get it back. Loss: Brooklin Yazzie, from Mesa, Arizona is desperate to find her wedding ring after she accidentally gave it away with the Halloween candy on Friday night . 'I don't know if it helps, but maybe if people out there hear about our story it will help encourage that ring to be returned,' Carlin said. Brooklyn Yazzie from Mesa accidentally gave her ring away in Halloween candy. Yazzie said the ring is not necessarily expensive but has sentimental value. She was only 20 years old when she married her husband 10 years ago, and says she couldn’t afford a fancy ring at the time. ‘If you were to try and pawn it or sell it you could probably get $50 for it. It's not an expensive ring,’ she said. ‘It’s my wedding ring, you know? I mean you could replace it but it’s not the same.’ Yazzie has created posters to try and alert people to the lost wedding ring. She has plastered them all around the area where she lives in the hope that someone has it.","'At first, I thought it might be a toy ring,' said David Carlin after his children spotted the diamond in their Halloween candy .

"The New Zealand businesswoman who said she fell prey to an alleged group sex attack in Sydney after meeting a man on the dating app, Tinder, has retracted her statement. Police are no longer investigating the incident. They would not comment on why the woman withdrew her allegations. The 28-year-old, who was visiting Sydney on a business trip, had alleged she met up a with a man of Maori or Pacific Islander appearance at a restaurant in the Kings Cross nightclub district. Scroll down for video . Police warned that Tinder-users should take extra caution when meeting people from online as they are of 'sexual predators out there who use modern technology to find potential victims' This comes after a New Zealand woman met up with a man at Kings Cross, Sydney's inner city, on Saturday night after speaking to him through mobile dating app Tinder . The pair then headed to a bar in Martin Place, it was claimed, and soon after she began to feel dizzy and numb. The woman said she woke up at a property in Botany on Sunday, unaware of where she was. She later told colleagues and reported the incident to a hospital, and then police, on Monday. Sex Crime Squad investigators believed at least three men were involved with the incident. But as of Thursday, they had not identified any suspects. Police said yesterday the victim was 'struggling'. 'It's a very emotional time for her,' Detective Inspector Michael Haddow told reporters. 'A very difficult incident, the whole matter.' The woman has since returned to New Zealand and was being supported by family. The incident provoked police into issuing a warning to online daters to be cautious when meeting strangers for the first time. Inspector Haddow told reporters a persona on a dating app may differ from their real life identity. 'The message is not to not use sites like this, but ... to do so with a degree of caution,' he said. Scroll down for video . Police say the pair then moved on to a bar in Martin Place where they were joined by the man's friends . A New Zealand woman was sexually assaulted by three men after she met a man on the mobile dating app, Tinder . He further advised that those thinking of meeting someone from dating websites or apps should bring a friend on the date. 'We strongly advise people that if they decide to meet a person they have been introduced to via the internet, then ensure the meeting is in a public place and take a friend along with you.' 'Having a friend there ensures that one of you can always keep an eye on your drink, and you have someone to turn to who can help you out should you feel threatened or uncomfortable.' 'If it's not possible to bring a friend with you, then, at the very least, stay in regular contact with a family member or friend, keeping them abreast of how the night is going and where you may be heading to,' the inspector said. Last month a New Zealand tourist Warrienna Wright, 26, fell to her death from a Gold Coast apartment balcony hours after meeting a man she matched with on Tinder. Gable Tostee, a 28-year-old carpet layer, has been charged with Ms Wright's murder. There's been no comment from the dating app, Tinder, as yet. Police said they will not provide any further comment.","Woman behind Tinder gang rape allegations retracts her statement .

"The family of Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Vinson have hired a powerful attorney with a history of high-profile legal cases after angrily denying she was 'careless' in flying to Ohio and back while carrying the virus. Amber Vinson, 29, who works at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas caught Ebola after helping to care for 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan. Billy Martin is a D.C.-based trial lawyer who has represented Wesley Snipes during his tax case, NFL player Michael Vick while he fought dog-fighting charges and the mother of Monica Lewinsky during the Clinton sex scandal. Scroll down for video . The family of Ebola-stricken nurse Amber Vinson (left) have hired DC attorney Billy Martin (right) after coming to her defense against the CDC . Hazmat workers help each other put on protective clothing before entering The Village Bend East apartment complex where Amber Vinson lives. Some 153 people are being monitored - and three are under quarantine - in Ohio as a result of a visit Vinson made while unknowingly carrying Ebola . In a statement released by Miss Vinson's family on Sunday, they said the nurse would never 'knowingly' put anybody at risk, was vigilant in testing herself for signs, and followed all the relevant protocols. The statement attacked any suggestion that she ignored medical or government guidelines. The statement added: 'In the interest of Amber and our family, we have retained esteemed attorney Billy Martin to provide us with legal counsel during this unfortunate and troubling time.' Miss Vinson flew from Dallas to Cleveland on October 10 and flew back on October 13. She was hospitalized with the virulent illness hours after her return last week. In the wake of the nurse's trip to plan her upcoming wedding, 153 people are being monitored for signs of the disease, and three are in quarantine. Medical staff who care for patients with Ebola are allowed to fly provided they were wearing protective gear while dealing with the virus. The statement said she reported her body temperature three times before boarding her flight home last week. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged Miss Vinson checked in repeatedly and was cleared for travel. Cleveland station WOIO reported the family's statement and said that they feel public comments and media outlets 'mischaracterize Amber and her actions'. It said: 'Suggestions that she ignored any of the physician and government-provided protocols recommended to her are patently untrue and hurtful. 'Although the majority of the correspondences we have received since her diagnosis have been positive, we are troubled by some of the negative public comments and media coverage that mischaracterize Amber and her actions . 'To be clear, in no way was Amber careless prior to or after her exposure to Mr. Thomas Eric Duncan. She has not and would not knowingly expose herself or anyone else.' Three people have been quarantined in northeast Ohio following Vinson's visit to Cleveland to prepare for her wedding. None of the three, quarantined after new monitoring guidelines by the state, has exhibited Ebola-like symptoms. Police keep watch over the house in Ohio last week where Miss Vinson stayed with her stepfather last weekend after flying to her hometown from Texas . 'Patient zero': Thomas Eric Duncan was the first person to die of Ebola in the United States. He brought the virus over from Liberia and died on October 8 . Every day, the Ebola sufferers in the United States and their caregivers produce an astonishing eight 55-gallon barrels of medical waste PER DAY. Masks, gloves, linens, utensils, medical instruments--everything the patient contacts must be destroyed and the garbage is piling up. While one surefire way to destroy the pathogen is to incinerate the waste, some states have already said 'no way' to requests they accept the tainted garbage. Missouri's attorney general has even made moves to bar Ebola-contaminated waste from being destroyed at a St. Louis facility, reports the LA Times. Earlier this month, a Louisiana waste disposal site refused to accept the ashes generated when a Thomas Eric Duncan's belongings from his apartment were incinerated and a judge even signed an order temporarily blocking the disposal in the state. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said during a news conference that the virus is not considered to be hardy in the environment and that incineration and chemical treatment of the infected waste is sufficient to remove any risk. Initially, only Vinson's stepfather had been quarantined, in his home in suburban Akron. The two others, in Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, and in Summit County, were quarantined after. Ohio governor John Kasich ordered the new guidelines, which include travel restrictions, on Saturday. A state health official said the guidelines are meant to remove any chance of Ebola spreading. 'As we've seen, travel is a potential problem,' state epidemiologist Dr. Mary DiOrio said. 'It's why the people of Ohio are dealing with the situation we have right now.' Under the guidelines, anyone who has had direct contact with the skin, mucus membranes, blood or bodily fluids of someone diagnosed with Ebola must be quarantined for 21 days. Anyone who did not have direct skin contact but reported spending more than an hour in close proximity to an infected person is not to travel commercially for 21 days. Such people also are to seek permission to travel outside the health jurisdictions where they live. People who were in the same enclosed space as an Ebola carrier are not to travel outside the U.S. Ebola is spread through bodily fluids. Someone who is infected does not become contagious until he or she shows symptoms of the disease. Health officials have said Vinson exhibited some symptoms while in Ohio. There are 153 people being monitored in Ohio because of contact or potential contact with Vinson. They include people with whom Vinson had direct contact, those who visited the Akron bridal shop where her bridesmaids tried on dresses on October 11 and those who were passengers on the flights she took. Vinson is being cared for at a specialized unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Her family said she is a 'deeply committed nurse driven by a fundamental passion for helping others'. One of Miss Vinson's Dallas hospital colleagues, 26-year-old nurse Nina Pham, also is being treated for Ebola.","Billy Martin is a D.C.-based lawyer who represented Wesley Snipes during his tax case, NFL player Michael Vick while he fought dog-fighting charges .

Mr Browne said the mating ritual battle, which is commonly seen at this time of year when the weather gets warmer, ends when the weaker, and usually smaller one of the two snakes back down. Mr Browne said there would have been a female snake nearby even though he searched the roof but couldn't find her. He warned not to go near snakes even if it was to contain them until a snake handler arrived. 'Unless you are really sure whether they are dangerous - you should never go near them because it could be a red belly or a brown snake which would not end well,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Just keep an eye on them from a distance while you call us.' Carpet pythons are not venomous although they about 100 teeth to give you a decent bite. 'I've been bitten by them - they hurt a bit and bleed a lot but they are not dangerous,' he said. 'It's the pets you've got to worry about like small cats and dogs.' 'Guinea pigs are a common one because people don't seal the cages properly,' he said. 'The snake gets in the cage and eats the guinea pig but can't get out because it has a full tummy - the same things happens with chicken coops.'

"A frog has survived being swallowed whole and then spat out by a snake in north Queensland. Zoologist and snake catcher Lauren Dibben says the one metre-long tree snake regurgitated the green tree frog in an attempt to make a quick getaway when she tried to remove it from a yard in Weipa, western Cape York. 'I just picked it up and then realised it was about to regurgitate something,' she told AAP on Monday. 'I thought maybe it had eaten a rat but it then vomited out a green tree frog backwards. This frog survived an incredible ordeal after it was swallowed by a snake and escaped alive in one piece . 'It just popped onto the ground and it was covered in spit and other snake stomach juices.' To her surprise, the frog then started to move. 'The frog then took a breath. So I rinsed it off and it pretty much looked like a brand new frog,' she said. 'He sat there a little bit stunned and I think he went and sat somewhere quiet for a while.' Ms Dibben, who has been working as a part-time snake catcher for the past two years, believes the snake regurgitated its meal so it could make a quick getaway. The snake (not pictured) vomited up the frog which to zoologist Lauren Dibben's surprise started to move . 'I guess it's easier to do that on an empty stomach,' she said, adding that she released the snake in nearby bushland after the ordeal last Saturday. Ms Dibben says the frog may have survived because it can hold its breath for a long time and it's likely it had only been inside the snake for a couple of minutes. It was also lucky because the snake wasn't venomous and eats its prey alive. 'I think the frog will survive but I think the snake was a bit disappointed he lost his breakfast,' Ms Dibben said.","The green tree frog was swallowed whole by a snake in Cape York .

Model behavior: Ms Crawford also looked stunning with make-up when she stepped out with husband Rande Gerber at a West Hollywood event last week . She recently shared her skincare regime with Violet Grey, revealing, 'I’ve been getting microdermabrasion facials with Cristina Radu for 13 years, and that’s been great for my skin.' She continued: 'I’ve been working with the dermatologist Jean-Louis Sebagh on my skin-care line - also for 13 years - and he knows what he’s doing. Dr. Sebagh is not about damaging your skin with lasers and peels to make it look better.

Naomi Campbell looked gorgeous in her early morning picture as she is part of a host of celebrities taking part in the #WakeUpCall selfie campaign . 'I use SPF day cream every day, cleanser every day and night. I definitely use the night cream, eye cream and the Crème de Serum from my line. What I think is true is that [results are] cumulative. When a 35-year-old starts taking care of her skin, she won’t look different. It’s when you’re my age that you start seeing the payoff.' In June, she announced that she's already planning to celebrate her 50th birthday with a coffee table book that will feature photos as well as the secrets of her success. 'It'll come out in the fall before I turn 50, so it's kind of a way to celebrate 50 as opposed to dreading it,' she said.","The 48-year-old supermodel posted the picture to her Instagram account .

"Missouri police have been brushing up on constitutional rights and stocking up on riot gear to prepare for a grand jury's decision about whether to charge a white police officer who fatally shot a black 18-year-old in suburban St. Louis. The preparations are aimed at avoiding a renewed outbreak of violence during the potentially large demonstrations that could follow an announcement of whether Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson will face a criminal trial for the Aug. 9 death of Michael Brown. Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed since the shooting, which prompted a national conversation about race and police tactics. Missouri police have been brushing up on constitutional rights and stocking up on riot gear to prepare for a grand jury's decision about whether to charge police officer Darren Wilson, who fatally shot a black 18-year-old in suburban St. Louis . Images of officers in riot gear and armored vehicles confronting protesters have drawn widespread criticism. Many protesters want Darren Wilson indicted for murder. Grand jury proceedings are secret, but legal analysts say recently leaked information about Wilson's testimony to investigators may be an attempt to prepare the public for the possibility that he might not be charged. The decision could be made public within the next month. In the meantime, law officers have adjusted their tactics for interacting more peacefully with protesters while also honing their procedures for quick, widespread arrests. They plan to have a large contingent of officers at the ready, but have been meeting with clergy, community leaders and students in hopes of building relationships that could ease tensions on the streets. 'I know there's a lot of anxiety, there's a lot of fear, anticipation' about that announcement, said Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who was put in charge of security in Ferguson in the days after Brown was killed and is now part of a coordinated command with local police. But 'I have a lot of hope.' Law enforcement officers expect to receive at least a day's notice before a grand jury announcement. That should provide time for them to execute security plans but may also allow demonstrators to prepare. Potentially large demonstrations could follow an announcement of whether Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson will face a criminal trial for the death of Michael Brown (pictured) 'The moment I learn that there is, in fact, a non-indictment, then there's going to be an organized protest,' said Eric Vickers, a black St. Louis attorney and civil rights activist. Brown was unarmed when Wilson encountered him walking in the street with a friend. A scuffle ensued and Brown was shot multiple times. Witness accounts of what happened varied, with some people saying they saw Brown raise his hands as if in surrender. Wilson told investigators he felt threatened while fighting with Brown from inside a police SUV, where an initial gunshot was fired, according to information provided to several news outlets by people described as familiar with the investigation, but otherwise not identified. After Brown fled the vehicle, Wilson said Brown turned around in threatening manner, prompting the officer to fire the fatal shots, according to those accounts of his testimony. Wilson's description of events was leaked recently, as was an autopsy report that showed Brown had marijuana in his system and was shot in the hand at close range. Wilson has alleged Brown was trying to grab his gun in the SUV. 'It appears that it may be calculated to soften the blow if there is no indictment,' said Peter Joy, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who directs the school's Criminal Justice Clinic. But, he said, 'it's conceivable that if the leaks are from law enforcement that perhaps there may be an indictment and this is calculated to garner public sympathy for officer Wilson.' Amnesty International has accused police of violating citizens' rights by intimidating protesters using riot gear, aiming high-powered weapons at people, using tear gas, firing rubber bullets and flash-bangs, and setting curfews . Wilson's attorneys have denied being the source of the reports. The shooting stoked long-simmering racial tensions in Ferguson, a predominantly black community with an overwhelmingly white police force. Protests have continued for two months in the St. Louis area, often peaceful but sometimes devolving into clashes between police firing tear gas and demonstrators lobbing rocks and bottles. Law enforcement agencies have declined to say whether they will proactively line the streets with more officers as the grand jury announcement is made or position them in strategic locations to react as needed. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said he's learned it works better to let sergeants and lieutenants retain their normal place in the chain of command, instead of supplanting them with higher-ranking officers. 'We've also learned we have to have a dialogue with our demonstrators, so they know what to expect from us, and we know what to expect from them,' Belmar said. Amnesty International on Thursday released a report documenting what it described as human rights abuses by police during the protests following Brown's death. The report accuses police of violating citizens' rights by intimidating protesters using riot gear, aiming high-powered weapons at people, using tear gas, firing rubber bullets and flash-bangs, and setting curfews. Protests have continued for two months in the St. Louis area, often peaceful but sometimes devolving into clashes between police firing tear gas and demonstrators lobbing rocks and bottles . Police are attempting to better document events and handle widespread arrests more efficiently. To ensure it's at full strength, the state Highway Patrol is limiting trooper vacations around the time of a potential decision, and local police may be put on longer shifts. After the initial clashes with protesters, the state Highway Patrol purchased more shields and equipment for its officers. St. Louis city police recently spent $325,000 upgrading helmets, sticks and other 'civil disobedience equipment,' said Police Chief Sam Dotson. More than 350 St. Louis officers now have been trained in civil disobedience tactics. St. Louis County police and state troopers also have undergone training, focused largely on ensuring they understand protesters' constitutional rights. Belmar, Johnson and other law officers have been meeting frequently with clergy, students and community leaders. Pastors, in turn, have been preaching messages of non-violence. Earlier this week, Democratic state Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, of St. Louis, intentionally got arrested for refusing to leave the street in front of the Ferguson Police Department. Even that was an act preparation. Nasheed said she wanted to show others that 'you can peacefully protest, but you don't have to be violent under the banner of justice for Michael Brown.'","Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed since the shooting .

"Remember, remember the fifth of November. For that was the day Benedict Cumberbatch broke a million hearts by declaring himself engaged to be married to his girlfriend, Sophie Hunter. The 38-year-old actor’s crisp announcement came in the Forthcoming Marriages section of the Times newspaper, one line of nuptial intent that sent fans into meltdown. First, the ultimate bachelor George Clooney gets married — and now Sherlock in wedlock shock? Well, I am afraid so, ladies. The bad news just keeps on coming. Scroll down for video . Benedict Cumberbatch, 38 (left), admits himself that he looks like an otter (right) but he still inspires breathless devotion among his loyal fan base . In the streets and in the houses, and all across the wastes of cyberspace on both sides of the Atlantic, there was a great wailing and gnashing of teeth. Benedict has found true love after a whirlwind romance? Please, please, say it’s not so! ‘I feel like crying,’ tweeted one fan. ‘How could he?’ said another. Yet, from the sidelines, millions more looked on in bemusement, wondering what on earth all the fuss was about. For even though Cumberbatch was dubbed one of Britain’s most eligible bachelors by Tatler magazine in 2012 and regularly appears on Sexiest Man Alive lists, not everyone is bowled over by his odd, vulpine features and singular charm. Indeed, many men grumpily wonder exactly what it is about this lanky toff with the gingery tinge that inspires such breathless devotion among his loyal fan base. Even by Cumberbatch’s own admission he looks like an otter — or a ‘muppet otter’, as some of his more delirious fans insist. Those who don’t feel the Cumber-love believe he might actually be an alien who lives in an underwater cave. And that he is cold-hearted and sinister, with tiny halibut eyes and a freckled, cadaverous mien. Closer examination would quite possibly reveal webbing between the Cumber-toes and a secret, collapsible shark fin on his Cumber-spine — an aquatic aide that is unfurled only when he goes Cumber-swimming. The actor sent his fans into meltdown after announcing he would be marrying his girlfriend Sophie Hunter. The pair are pictured together at the French Open earlier this year . Cumberbatch even flew to Edinburgh to visit his girlfriend’s mother, especially to ask for a parental blessing and permission to marry his Sophie, whom he has known for five years but has been dating for five months . Then there are others, like me, who totally understand his appeal. Benedict — as I like to call him — may not be classically handsome, but handsome he undoubtedly is. That high, broad forehead; those kindly eyes; the strange lips that look as if they were painted by Picasso and would leave a diamond-shaped imprint on your neck, a brand of love that gently burned into your skin like a . . . where was I? Oh, yes. So these are the traits that women respond to, that have made the former public schoolboy an international heartthrob. More than this, there is also something unquenchably noble about Cumberbatch, an inbuilt sense of grace and the strong suspicion that whatever the right thing is to do, he would selflessly do it in a heartbeat. Nick Clegg he is not. Intelligent and self-deprecating, the Cumber-Ben-person is a trumpet among today’s celebrity tin whistles, a he-giant in a world of lost boys with gelled hair and silly shoes. A proper grown-up, he even flew to Edinburgh to visit his girlfriend’s mother, especially to ask for a parental blessing and permission to marry his Sophie. So darling! He is the kind of man who would swirl his Burberry Mackintosh over a puddle so that a lady — any lady — did not get her feet wet. No wonder his devotees are so upset. When the news broke, thousands of them got together on social media to agree that their lives were ruined, shattered, not worth living any more, basically over, kaput, kill me now, it is the end of days. The actor’s devoted fangirls, the hardcore obsessives who call themselves the Cumberbitches, plunged through the five stages of grief in various public forums. Cumberbatch was dubbed one of Britain’s most eligible bachelors by Tatler magazine in 2012 and regularly appears on Sexiest Man Alive lists . I must say, it was quite entertaining. There was denial (‘Nooo!’), anger (‘I hate him now’), bargaining (‘Does he secretly still love me?’), depression (‘I have no tears left to shed’) and a kind of acceptance (‘Let us now grief-eat in an orderly fashion’). They were mourning a man whom they had never met but with whom they had somehow convinced themselves they had a shot. Then he went and got engaged to someone who wasn’t them, just like that snake George Clooney did. Within the boundaries of the fragile, fairytale relationship that exists between star and fan, it almost makes it worse that both these hugely eligible stars chose ordinary women — or, at least, women who were not red carpet-ready Hollywood actresses — to share their lives with. It feeds the Cinderella myth and adds fuel to the notion, however fanciful, that it could have been a Cumberbitch up there with Benedict’s ring on her finger. Except it wasn’t. Not that there is anything ordinary about human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, with her gazelle legs and international rescue mission to save the Elgin Marbles. By marrying Clooney, she’s already got her hands on a fabulous old artefact. Isn’t is just plain greedy to want another one? Fans have been avidly following Cumberbatch since his 2010 breakthrough in the BBC series Sherlock, in which he stars with Martin Freeman . And beautiful bluestocking Sophie is very far from ordinary, too. A former actress who first met Cumberbatch on the set of the 2009 film Burlesque Fairytales, she is better known as an award-winning opera and theatre director who writes plays in her spare time. Gah! If anything, the 36-year-old Oxford graduate is even posher than he is, which is, as Bananarama once pointed out, really saying something. How romantic that both of them had been in long-term relationships before, had known each other through work for five years but only started dating earlier this year and quickly realised they were in love. My dear Watson, when you know, you just know . . . The fans, who have been avidly following Cumberbatch since his 2010 breakthrough in the BBC series Sherlock, will just have to get used to the new status quo and accept that the guillotine of reality has sliced down on their Cinderella daydreams. As far as BC is concerned, the glass slipper has been smashed for ever. The 38-year-old actor’s crisp announcement came in the Forthcoming Marriages section of the Times newspaper, one line of nuptial intent that sent fans into meltdown . However, there are consolations. Benedict Cumberbatch may be off the market, but he will be in the spotlight more and more. He is incredibly talented, so much so that I am hoping he is going to be the next James Bond. Why not? He is the quintessential quirky Brit, someone who can project the necessary nerves of steel, courage of a lion and chip of ice lodged in his dark, English heart. Who else would you want to be snuggled up to in a foxhole under fire from the enemy? Cumberbatch is his own man, he goes his own way. Uniquely, he is a very old-fashioned sort of matinee idol; a man who knows how to wear a tuxedo and to shoot his cuffs. And perhaps the most curious thing about him is that despite his other-worldly appearance, he always looks just right in any time zone, from futuristic sci-fi films to playing a World War I officer in War Horse. So what next for the Cumberbitches? They will recover. They will have to recover. They can always join the queue at Madame Tussauds to pay homage to, and take selfies with, Cumberbatch’s new wax effigy. Unveiled last month and depicting the actor in a pose of typically roguish grandeur, it has already proved hugely popular with those who come only to worship and cry. But some Cumberbitches can also be selfless. ‘Who wants Benedict Cumberbatch to go home to an empty house at night?’ one tweeted through her tears this week. Who indeed?","The 38-year-old actor shattered hearts when he announced he was engaged .

"A US Airways passenger jet travelling between Brussels and Philadelphia was forced to turn back after developing a technical fault over Ireland. Flight US751 was passing Shannon in the West of Ireland when the captain decided to abandon his trans-Atlantic crossing after the Boeing 757-200 developed a fault. Unfortunately for the passengers and crew on board the Boeing 757 is unable to dump fuel so the captain was forced to enter a holding pattern west of Brussels for several hours. Scroll down for video . The US Airways jet, pictured,  developed a rudder problem as it was about to cross the Atlantic this afternoon . The Boeing 757-200 was unable to dump fuel and was forced to return to Brussels and circle for several hours while it came down its maximum landing weight and arrived safely after more than six hours in the air . The aircraft took off from Brussels en-route to Philadelphia but was forced to turn around as it passed the west coast of Ireland after developing a fault and circled for several hours near Ghent before landing safely . The jet landed safely after 16.30 after spending more than six hours in the air. It is understood the captain was forced to circle Brussels as he was over his maximum landing weight and needed to reduce the amount of fuel on board. The narrow bodied aircraft has a capacity to carry a maximum of 204 seats, with 18 people in business class and 186 in economy. The aircraft was almost 90 minutes into its flight when it developed the fault and returned to its original departure point. It is understood the aircraft descended to 19,000ft and and slowed to 380kts while it waited to land. A spokesperson for the Irish Aviation Authority said: 'Our Air Traffic Controllers at Shannon were notified about a problem with the aircraft and we facilitated its turnaround.'

"A cash-strapped police force paid a member of staff £7,500 in compensation after she suffered 'discomfort' because her headset was too loud. Figures revealed by Staffordshire Police show the force shelled out over £134,000 to regular officers and PCSOs in just four years. One 46-year-old female officer pocketed £4,400 for a strain caused by an 'ill-fitting protective vest' in January 2009 while another received £6,262 when she tripped in an unlit area . In total Staffordshire Police paid out £134,000 to 27 officers and PCSOs between 2009 and 2013, including £2,000 to one 43-year-old officer for falling over a curb in February 2012 . A 43-year-old PC also got £2,000 for falling over a curb in February 2012, and a male PC got £10,000 for a spinal injury caused by a fall on ice from a burst water pipe in December 2010. Another got £1,850 for falling over a pothole in February last year while one employee received a whopping £14,474 for slipping on an 'untreated' surface in June 2011. A Freedom of Information request revealed in total the force have paid out £134,100 for 27 claims by officers and members of staff between 2009 and 2013. Cases were submitted for injuries including broken bones, cuts, whiplash, and stress from incidents like road traffic collisions and training exercises. One 39-year-old female member of staff's case is still ongoing after she complained of multiple bruising for a fall due to a 'lift not being level when stopped' in 2011. Ray Egan, 75, a former officer from the neighbouring West Midlands Police from 1967 to 1993, described the payouts as 'embarrassing'. Police officers have sought huge sums for controversial claims. Among them are: . WPC Fiona Clark sued for £400,000. She hurt her back lifting boxes of stationery. WPC Kelly Jones demanded £50,000 from the owner of a petrol station where she tripped on the kerb during a call-out. Detective . Inspector Brian Baker won a £7,000 payout after he claimed exposure to . cannabis fumes made him snore and caused problems in his marriage. WPC Louise McGarva sued for £500,000 after claiming she developed a fear of sirens following a riot-training exercise. PC John Franklin won £108,000. He was injured by handcuffs on a safety course. PC George Smillie was awarded an estimated £10,000 after he hurt his knee playing football on a training course. WPC Lesley O’Shea sued for £200,000 after slipping on a banana skin. He said: 'It's all to do with this claim culture, it's like a disease and people are jumping on the bandwagon. 'Back in our day we knew being injured in the line of duty was a risk - but we got on with it because we wanted to protect the public. 'It was part and parcel of being a copper. I don't know where it is going end. It is embarrassing for all forces involved at a time when they are looking to save cash. 'It's costing the country a lot of money, it could be spent on policing and put to much better use. 'It's crazy really. They can't stop people claiming, it's just going to go on and on. I'm just glad I'm retired and out of it.' Andy Silvester, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, added: 'Some of these claims are clearly ludicrous. The force must do a better job protecting taxpayers.' Not all of the claims were approved, however. Among those turned down was a female officer who applied for compensation for bruising sustained whilst entering a police car in January 2009. Another female member of staff received nothing after claiming she received a spinal injury by adjusting a chair in June 2010. And several officers' claims were rejected for cuts or wounds sustained as a result of being bitten by a police dog. Andy Adams, chairman of the Staffordshire Police Federation said long-running disputes over pensions and pay could be to blame for the 'claim culture'. One female officer was paid £7,500 for 'discomfort' because her headset was too loud. Another  case is ongoing after she claimed for bruising after a fall from a lift because the floor was not level (stock image) He added: 'I think for some officers the goodwill has gone from the job, and they feel battered from the changes to pay and pensions, so maybe when in the past they wouldn't have made a claim for injuries they're now feeling unloved and feel they need to claim.' Mr Adams also defended officers who receive payouts after being injured in traffic collisions or when trying to arrest offenders. He added: 'Some of the claims are a bit bizarre, and I do wonder why people are claiming for injuries they might have caused themselves. 'But for officers injured performing an arrest, on a high speed pursuit or similar incidents, then I've absolutely no problem with that.' The figures follow on from a claim for £50,000 in damages by WPC Kelly Jones after she tripped over a curb at a petrol station in March last year, claiming she had been put at 'unnecessary risk'. Petrol station owner Steve Jones called the police after the alarm began going off at the Nuns' Bridges Service Station and WPC Jones went to investigate. She eventually dropped her claim, but only after sending Mr Jones a three-page solicitors letter outlining her claim, leaving him seething with anger. In November, PCSO Pauline Harrison, 53,injured herself after falling over while investigating a break-in at a property firm. She was awarded £4,000, but solicitors took £57,000 in fees.","Staffordshire Police paid total of £134,000 to 27 officers from 2009 to 2013 .

"In a move to boost sales and promote a healthier image, beverage giant Coca-Cola Amatil has launched a new 250ml slimline can for Australian consumers on the run. In what Coca Cola says is its biggest product launch since Coke Zero, the 'perfectly small' cans will cost no more than $2 and will be sold at convenience stores and petrol outlets Australia-wide. The company believes the availability of smaller cans of its Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta drinks will increase sales by appealing to consumers watching their hip-pockets and their waistlines. Perfectly small: Coca Cola hopes its new slimline can will boost sales of the iconic soft drink . Coca-Cola says its multimillion dollar 'perfectly small can' campaign is its biggest since the launch of Coke Zero . 'We've listened to what consumers want and we're getting serious about smaller portion sizes,' a Coca-Cola Spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. 'This is really about providing consumers with more choice and the point of difference is that you'll be able to buy these  small cans from more convenient outlets, giving people the option to grab a taste of their favourite drink on the run.' Coca Cola says the smaller cans are one part of the company's commitment to a 'healthier Australia'. 'Last year we launched a series of commitments across our food and beverage products to help address the problem of obesity in Australia and portion sizes was certainly a part of that plan,' said a spokesperson for the company.' Changes also include offering a wider selection of low-kilojoule beverage options and providing transparent nutritional information in more places, including vending machines. 'We believe Coca-Cola has an important role in providing more beverage choices, including more choice in serve sizes and low-kilojoule options, clearly communicating the kilojoule content of our products and supporting community-based physical activity programs,' said Phil Roberts, Commercial and Franchise Director of Coca-Cola South Pacific last year. Coca-Cola says its new small cans are part of the companies commitment to address obesity in Australia . Coca-Cola Amatil is Australia's largest beverage company, with 60 per cent of the soft drink market. But last year, the company posted a 16 per cent fall in profits as consumers moved away from sugary fizzies towards healthier options like juices and coconut water. Coca-Cola, who are launching a multimillion dollar 'small' marketing campaign say the new 250ml cans have been popular in other markets. 'People still love Coke, it's been around for 128 years and there's nothing that will replace it,' said a Spokesperson for the company. Coca-Cola already sells 200ml 'mini-cans' in multi-packs in supermarkets for about $1.09 a can. The average price of a regular can of coke is about $3. Jeff Rogut from the Australasian Association of Convenience Stores says the new 250ml cans may help smaller retailers compete by being able to offer a cheaper, more convenient product but he doesn't believe they will 'revolutionize' sales. 'The product is the same. The price may change and the value equation may change but consumers are interested in having something really new and different,"" he told Fairfax. 'How many ways can you package Coca-Cola?.'","Soft drink giant launches new slimline cans for $2 in Australia .

"Caroline Foxley, 58 (pictured outside Gloucester Crown Court), has been convicted of falsely claiming benefits while having £308,000 in a bank account . A middle class mother-of-two who claimed welfare benefits in Britain despite having more than £300,000 in a Swiss bank account and sending her children to top fee-paying schools has been told she faces jail. Caroline Foxley, 58, of Cradley, near Malvern, Worcestershire, who was described as 'greedy' and 'thoroughly dishonest' throughout her trial, has been convicted of falsely claiming benefits between 2007 and 2009. After the jury found her guilty at Gloucester Crown Court today, the judge bailed her for three weeks for pre-sentence reports and warned her: 'You are in danger of going into custody.' During the trial, the court heard how Foxley had received £306,000 from the sale of a Cotswolds house in 2007 but deposited the money into a Swiss bank account. She went on to claim income support and Jobseeker's Allowance from the Department of Work and Pensions, as well as council tax and housing benefits from Cotswold District Council. Such allowances are available only to people with less than £16,000 in capital assets but she did not declare the house proceeds and said she only had £100 in a Lloyds TSB account. Foxley claimed she did not regard the £306,000 as her own money and felt it was in a trust for her German ex-partner Dr Kurt Mayer and her two children. However, her explanation was rejected by the jury of seven men and five women in less than an hour. Mr Leathley, applying for bail for Foxley, said she had recently been without a permanent address and some places she could stay were no longer available because friends had seen publicity about her case. He said she had a month's use of a house in Cradley, Malvern, which a potential employer had leased for her, but the offer of the £30,000 job as his housekeeper was later withdrawn because of the publicity. Judge McGrigor bailed Foxley to the Cradley address on the condition she surrenders her passport and reports once a day to Malvern Police, pending her sentencing on November 13. Foxley, formerly of Mickleton, Gloucestershire, had denied four charges of dishonestly failing to report a change in her circumstances affecting her entitlement to benefits and dishonestly making false representations to obtain benefits between March 2007 and March 2009. Stephen Mooney, prosecuting, told the jury at the start of the trial: 'The case involves her making a calm, calculated and rational decision to top up her already quite substantial income by making false claims for benefit. 'It is the prosecution case that this is a thoroughly dishonest woman who decided to get money she knew she was not entitled to in the hope and expectation, and arrogance, that she would not be caught. Foxley was warned she faces jail by the judge after being found guilty  at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) 'Greedy people bank on not being caught but this was a gamble in respect of which this woman failed.' Until March 30 2007, Foxley did qualify for benefits but she then sold the house which netted her £306,000. She used some of the money to pay outstanding fees to three schools attended at different times by her children Freddie and Miranda - Cheltenham Ladies College, Malvern College and Bloxham School in Banbury. 'These are not cheap schools,' Mr Mooney said. 'Between 2007 and 2009 when she was claiming poverty and penury she paid in the region of £48,000 to Bloxham School. 'This was a woman who had certain high expectations and standards for her children and a sense that she was entitled to a particular standard of living and she was going to have it come what may.' While claiming benefits, she sent her children to private schools including Cheltenham Ladies College (above) Referring to a £200,000 deposit she made at Habibson's Bank, he said: 'No doubt she was taking advantage of the notorious and well-documented reluctance of the Gnomes of Zurich to give out information about their bank accounts. The money went back to Zurich, spirited away, no doubt, to be used by Foxley. 'What we have here is a woman who has been caught out and frankly she doesn't like being caught out. 'She regards it as rather an affront that those perhaps less clever than her, less sophisticated than her, and less entitled than her, should have the right to pursue her. 'And all this at a time when the poorest in society are having their entitlement to benefits cut from beneath them because of the austerity which affects all of us - but not her. 'This is a case of someone using the benefits system as their own pocket money to help finance an already wealthy lifestyle.'","Mother Caroline Foxley, 58, convicted of falsely claiming welfare benefits .

"A new mother was found shot dead  Wednesday night, after family received a call to check up on her at home. Family members arrived at the Mars, Pennsylvania home of 42-year-old Tara Sherri Bouie around 11:30om Wednesday night and found her lying dead next to her 5-month-old baby who was sitting in a high chair. It appears Bouie suffered a gun shot wound to her head, but her young child was left unharmed. Investigators believe the baby could have been left unattended for more than 11 hours. Tara Bouie (right) was found shot dead in her western Pennsylvania home Wednesday night, next to her 5-month-old baby who was left unharmed. Police suspect foul play in the mother's death . Bouie's body was discovered by family who went to check on her late Wednesday night. It's estimated that her daughter could have been left alone for as long as 11 hours . Above, a police investigator takes pictures at the scene in Mars, Pennsylvania . Bouie had only been living in the home for a few months, and Pennsylvania State Police Lt Thomas Dubovi said in September it had been the scene of a raid where a man was arrested in connection with a homicide investigation. However, Lt Dubovi could not give more details on the SWAT activity since neighbor State Police or Adams Township Police were involved. 'This is a quiet neighborhood, a rural but affluent neighborhood. Most people around here work and have jobs. We don’t see large amounts of drug activity or anything like that. So, this is unusual,' Lt Dubovni told KDKA. Family told the station that the woman has a boyfriend, but that he doesn't live with her. Police continue to investigate the murder and so far have not made any arrests. 'The circumstances right now are leading us to believe there was foul play involved,' Lt Dubovni told WPXI. Bouie's child is now being cared for by family. An autopsy was set to be performed on Thursday. Bouie allegedly had a boyfriend who did not live with her. Her baby is now being taken care of by family.","Tara Bouie was found shot in the head at her Mars, Pennsylvania home on Wednesday .

"Pakistan is set to outlaw cannibalism following a gruesome case of two brothers who robbed graves to make ‘human curry’. Despite several incidents, cannibalism is still legal under Pakistani law, but lawmakers have now filed a bill banning the exhuming of a corpse for consumption or ‘use for magical purposes’. This comes after the re-arrest of convicted cannibal brothers Mohammad Arif Ali, 35, and Mohammad Farman Ali, 30, who allegedly dug up more than 100 corpses from the local graveyard in order to eat them, in April this year. Scroll down for video . Gruesome: Pakistan is set to outlaw cannibalism following the case of Mohammad Arif Ali and Mohammad Farman Ali  pictured at their April arrest, said to have robbed up to 100 graves to make ‘human curry’ Two bills have been filed in the Pakistani National Assembly this week, banning exhuming a human body ‘with intent to cook, eat, sell or to use for magic purposes’ and making consumption of human flesh punishable. Robbing graves for such purposes would see perpetrators facing a mandatory jail sentence of ten years to life, and at least seven for eating human flesh. Earlier this year the Ali brothers were re-arrested after the head of a three-year-old boy was discovered in their home in the small town of Darya Khan in Bhakkar District in the Punjab. The pair had previously served two years after police found that the corpse of a 24-year-old woman had disappeared from its grave in 2011. Reoffenders: The Ali brothers were only jailed for two years after their first conviction in 2011 and reoffended just months after they were released . Pakistani villager Mohammad Arif Ali is seen next to an officer at a police station in Bhakkar district in April, 2014, after the head of a three-year-old boy was found at his home -- three years after he and his brother were jailed for the same offence . Further investigations led officers to the brothers' house where they found a cooking pot containing meat curry. At the time, local police said the two men had dug up more than 100 corpses from the local graveyard and eaten them. District police chief, Ameer Abdullah, said officers swooped after residents complained of a bad smell coming from the brothers' home. 'Residents informed police after a stench emanated from the house of the two brothers,' he said. Abdullah added: 'We raided the house on Monday morning and found the head of a young boy.’","Pakistan is set to make cannibalism illegal after case of cannibal brothers .

"A criminal has been awarded a £19,000 taxpayer funded compensation payout after he hurt himself clambering over a gate during unpaid work. The settlement is part of  an estimated £500,000-per-year of compensation payments made to offenders who slip and fall during their community service. The unnamed criminal in West Mercia was handed a compensation cheque for £19,773 when he was injured in a fall as he tried to climb over a wooden gate while doing his unpaid work. An estimated £500,000-per-year of compensation payments have been made to offenders who slip and fall during community service . While in Humberside a total of £2,400 was paid to an offender who fell off a ladder and then claimed he hadn't been given proper instructions on how to use it. Probation services can be made to pay out if it is shown that they were negligent in that they didn't supervise the criminals properly, such as warning them about dangers or providing them with appropriate equipment. In South Yorkshire a criminal doing community service was paid £1,300 after he hurt himself lifting equipment onto a trailer. The legal costs in the case added another £8,250 to the bill for the probation service. An offender doing a work placement in London was paid £11,000 after a heavy concrete object fell on their foot. The criminal won their case on the basis that probation workers didn't provide enough supervision. There were also payouts of £4,000 to an offender by York and North Yorkshire Probation Trust and £10,500 to a criminal by Wales Probation Trust for injuries sustained while doing community payback work. £19,773 - fall  climbing over a gate . £2,400 - ladder plunge . £1,300 - lifting equipment onto a trailer . £11,000 - concrete block fell on foot . Probation staff also managed to sue their employers for damages when things went wrong. One claimed £12,000 after being attacked by an offender while in Wales £11,000 was paid to a member of staff hurt while at work. Devon and Cornwall Probation Trust paid £150,000 to a former staff member who successfully said that working conditions had caused them psychiatric damage. The Trust also paid £6,000 to another employee who hurt their knee getting out the back of a van. In a previous year it was reported how one criminal picked up £73,000 in compensation after they sprained their ankle while clearing brambles. Across the whole country it is estimated around £500,000-per-year is being paid by probation trusts to settle compensation claims brought against it by criminals and employees. The Ministry of Justice have said that they 'robustly' defend all claims for compensation from offenders . Peter Cuthbertson, Director at the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: 'Victims will be sickened by some of these payouts. 'Already community service is usually an expensive waste of taxpayers' money, failing to protect the public or stop re-offending. It is morally obscene if it also becomes a way for criminals to cheat the taxpayer of thousands.' A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'This Government has no intention of paying compensation when there is no good reason to do so and robustly defends all cases, as far as the evidence allows. Vexatious claims are always challenged and any payments are only made following clear legal advice. 'Community Payback is there to ensure that offenders make reparation to the community for the crimes they have committed.'

"Members of America's 'Greatest Generation' have descended upon Washington D.C. from all over the country - many for the first time - to visit the memorials dedicated to their service and sacrifice. Veterans from World War II, Vietnam and the Korean War started touching down in the nation's Capitol from Thursday, in an emotional trip that allowed them to reminisce their service days - and be appreciated for them. For many of the soldiers, it was their first look at the now 10-year-old WWII Memorial.

"With a fleet of fast cars, a vast property empire and income of £1million a month, drugs baron John Clark had grown accustomed to living in the lap of luxury. So when he was charged with money laundering, Clark promptly fled the country in his £150,000 Bentley Continental with a suitcase full of designer clothes to seek refuge in his plush Tenerife villa. Yesterday he was finally behind bars after the National Crime Agency found the 35-year-old fugitive holed up at a luxury hotel in Morocco. John Clark moved more than £1million worth of Class A drugs around Britain, while he lived in Spain . The criminal kingpin went on the run to Tenerife after he was spotted with a huge amount of cash, but was brought back to Britain and jailed for 25 years today. This picture of a villa was found on his mobile phone by police. On Clark's phone officers found pictures like this one of him in his Audi R8 Spyder, which is worth £120,000 . Officers covertly watched Clark hand over a bag containing £113,860 to a money launderer at a service station on the M6 in October that year - the cash was later seized . The father of two was jailed for 25 years after admitting money laundering and conspiracy to supply class A drugs as details emerged at Bolton Crown Court of his extraordinary lifestyle. When police raided his three-storey, seven-bedroom mansion in Waterfoot, Lancashire, they found shoe boxes stuffed with £77,000 of cash, money counting machines and a ledger recording deposits of £11.25million in just nine months between March 2012 and January 2013. The Honorary Recorder of Bolton, Judge Timothy Clayson said some of the transaction sizes were ‘astonishing’, with £1.35million racked up over just 40 days from supplying vast amounts of cocaine, heroin and amphetamines smuggled in from the Continent. With the proceeds from a drugs empire which stretched from Scotland to London and Merseyside to Lincolnshire, Clark splurged on a £1.2million farmhouse with stunning views over a 22-acre plot, which included 19 stables. Advertised as ‘enjoying a rare degree of privacy’ with a private gated driveway and a CCTV and alarm system, estate agents boasted the property also offered ‘phenomenal secure garaging facilities for the most ardent car enthusiast/collector’. Clark soon set about filling the garages with a £120,000 Audi R8 Spyder, a £150,000 Bentley Continental, a £250,000 convertible Bentley Azure, a £44,000 Audi RS3 and his and hers £65,000 Range Rover Sports, with a black model for himself and white one for his glamorous wife Angela, 30 . Clark's £1.2million farm in Waterfoot was raided as part of a probe into members of a money-laundering gang . During the raid on Clark's farm investigators found £77,000 in two shoeboxes as well as documents showing Clark had an impressive property portfolio and had recently purchased a new Audi R8 Spyder worth £120,000 . Police also found a ledger which detailed just nine-month's worth of illegal transactions - in which Clark's gang had moved £11million worth of drugs . He lavished thousands on refurbishments, decorating his home with zebra print wallpaper, chaise longues, signed boxing memorabilia and jacuzzi baths in five en-suite bathrooms. He also snapped up a further eight rental properties across Lancashire worth as much as £200,000 each, as well as several luxury villas in Spain and ‘an impressive property portfolio throughout Europe’, police believe. But his lifestyle attracted the attention of the NCA. They spent months with the Serious and Organised Crime Group of Greater Manchester Police carrying out surveillance and saw Clark hand over bags of cash to his cohorts at an M6 service station in 2011. Over the coming months, his henchmen were caught smuggling heroin, cocaine and amphetamines worth more than £11million into the UK. Fearing the net was closing, Clark fled while on bail in January last year, driving his Bentley to France and taking refuge at his Tenerife villa. Officers investigating the case found Clark had amassed a fleet of luxury cars, including this Range Rover . Clark (left) was jailed for 25 years today. Brian Fletcher (right) got 16 years for conspiracy to supply drugs . A police raid on Clark's found plenty of incriminating evidence including cash and documents . Investigators eventually tracked him down in June 2013 after they followed his wife to the five-star hotel in Morocco where he was staying. Clark later moaned about spending 316 days in a crowded Morocco jail before being extradited to Britain. Hugh Barton, defending, told the court how Clark lived in ‘appalling conditions’ having to share his cell with up to 60 other inmates. But the judge was unsympathetic about the plight of Clark, who had previously been jailed for four years for supplying cocaine in 2003. Malcolm Tidyman (left) got 16 years imprisonment and Andrew Hodson (right) was sentenced to 13 years, six months . Humphries (left) was convicted of a number of drug offences following a trial and sentenced to nine years. David Green (right) got 13 years, four months . Clark (pictured in one of his luxury cars) lived a 'playboy' lifestyle with the money he earned from running the multi-million pound drugs gang . Judge Clayson told him: ‘This is an instance of money laundering on a very large scale, all related to the vast profits flowing from your drug dealing operations. In my view your culpability is clearly high as you had a leading role.’ Eight other members of the gang were sentenced last October for a combined total of 88 years. Jim Cook, lead investigator for the National Crime Agency, said: ‘Clark’s lavish lifestyle is over. Not only has he been deprived off his freedom, he now faces losing his criminal assets. ‘We have restrained nine properties so far including his luxury multi-million pound family home. Our financial investigation is ongoing.’","Criminal gang trafficked more than £1million worth of drugs every month .

"Allegations: Cecily McMillan, 26 (pictured arriving at a hearing earlier this year) appeared in court to face allegations she threatened to kill a police officer's family during an incident on the New York subway . An Occupy Wall Street activist has been accused of threatening to kill a plain-clothed police officer's family during an incident on the New York subway. Cecily McMillan, 26, who was jailed for three months earlier this year for elbowing an officer during the 2012 demonstrations, allegedly made the threats when two fare-dodgers were being arrested. The graduate student from the New School appeared in a Manhattan court on Monday, charged with obstructing governmental administration during an altercation in Union Square station last December. Officer Luis Castillo told the pretrial hearing that he heard McMillan accuse his partner, officer Brian Rothermel, of being a 'male chauvinist pig',The Guardian reported. He claims she then said: 'And he probably doesn't have any kids or a wife, but if he did, I'd kill them.' McMillan has denied the misdemeanor charge which carries a year prison sentence if convicted. According to her supporters' website, McMillan was 'arrested again' by the NYPD for filming the police as they arrested two people inside station. The post reads: 'Cecily saw two plainly dressed men begin to abusively confront and interrogate a young couple. 'When she began to question them about the harassment, it turned out the men were police officers who then arrested them. 'Cecily followed them to the subway precinct, watching to make sure they were not further abused, and began to take a video of the arrest process from outside the precinct doors. McMillan, dubbed the 'queen of non-violence', was found guilty in May of assaulting a police officer during a demonstration two years before. As the verdict was read out and she was led away from the court room, her supporters shouted: 'Shame! Shame! Shame!' The student, who was 25 at the time, was sentenced to three years but served around eight on Rikers Island in New York. Her defense team maintained throughout the trial that she was startled and knocked the officer accidentally after he groped her left breast from behind. Activist: The graduate student was jailed for three months earlier this year for elbowing a police officer as she was led away from the Wall Street demonstrations in March 2012. She served eight weeks of the sentence . During the subway incident, McMillan was said to have grabbed the officers hand when one of the fare-dodgers tried to hand over his ID. As the pair were taken away, she continued to film the incident on her phone. Throughout the altercation, she claimed she was a lawyer, and when they reached the precinct doors, she tried to force her way in. According to officer Castillo, she then started shouting and screaming before she was arrested and handcuffed. A trial will begin when a jury has been selected while the judge ruled that her previous assault charges must not be mentioned by the prosecution. McMillan was one of 56 people to be convicted at trial for the demonstrations in March 2012, while another 11 people have been acquitted. The city had evicted Occupy's Zuccotti Park encampment four months earlier, but activists gathered there to celebrate the six-month mark. McMillan (pictured outside a Manhattan court in May) denies the charges, saying she was only filming two plain-clothed police officers arresting two fare-dodgers at Union Square station, New York .","Cecily McMillan, 25, interfered when she saw plain-clothed officers arresting a couple at Union Square station in December .

"When Samuel Johnson's sister set him the challenge to unicycle more than 15,000km around Australia to raise awareness for breast cancer, there was no way he could refuse. The 36-year-old former Secret Life of Us actor, who currently lives in Melbourne, had spent his whole life supporting his sister Connie, 37, who has battled cancer on three separate occasions. But Connie, a mother-of-two who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and given only six months to live, had more in mind than just simply raising $1 million for the Garvan Institute of Medical Research – she wanted to save her brother. Samuel and Connie Johnson started the Love Your Sister campaign in an effort to raise money for breast cancer research and encourage women to check their breasts . Connie also designed the campaign, which would see her younger brother unicycle around Australia, to make sure Sam, who had been suffering from depression and addiction, was OK when she died . 'Connie designed Love Your Sister not just to raise awareness for breast cancer, but to put me on the right track before she died – it was her devious attempt to fix me up,' Samuel told Daily Mail Australia. Samuel, who had lost his girlfriend to suicide in 2006, was suffering from depression and addiction when Connie was told that her breast cancer had spread to her liver, pelvis, spine and knee. 'I've always been her problematic brother and I suppose I wasn't doing too well when she got sick,' he said. 'I just wasn't the happiest I can be and I wasn't trying to be the best person I could be - I was kind of just distracted by the miscreant in me and her terminal diagnosis was a great wakeup call and she was determined that I find some of the happiness that she found in life,' he said. As far as siblings go, Connie and Samuel were like two peas in a pod, despite Samuel describing their childhood relationship as 'a tempestuous bond'. Connie's whole life has been dominated by cancer since she was first diagnosed with a rare aggressive bone tumour at 11-years-old . At 22, she was diagnosed with cancer again after a tumour was found in her womb. Four years ago, the mother-of-two found out she had breast cancer which had spread to her liver, pelvis, spine and knee . Together, they've been through more than most. After losing their mother to suicide at a young age, Connie was diagnosed with a rare aggressive bone tumour at 11-years-old. At 22, she was diagnosed with cancer again after a tumour was found in her womb. After beating both illnesses, Connie was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago and, after initial tests said she had won that fight too, later assessments revealed that the cancer had spread all over her body, rendering her condition 'terminal'. 'My childhood memories kick in on the day my dad told me that my sister had cancer - I don't really remember a time when Connie wasn't fighting cancer. It has dominated her life,' Samuel said. The campaign saw Samuel break the world record for the longest distance travelled on a unicycle . Samuel farewells Connie before his Australia-wide trip: The 36-year-old rode over 15,000km around the country in just under a year and raised over $1.9 million for cancer research . 'After decades of fighting and winning, she's been told now that she's going to lose after all that effort. 'Luckily, Connie has always had a great thirst for life. In the immediate aftermath of her terminal diagnosis, she decided she wanted to prevent other young mums from experiencing exactly what she was going through.' And so the Love Your Sister campaign was born and Samuel found himself breaking the world record for the longest distance travelled on a unicycle by riding over 15,000km around the country in just under a year. Sam said he 'cycled into every town, jumped on my pink soapbox and screamed the message out to anyone that would listen' - from juvenile justice centres, nursing homes and bikie gangs to the more standard fare of schools, community events, gala balls and grass-roots fundraisers . The duo have also released a book, a part memoir for Connie, about Samuel's adventures and Connie's life-long cancer battle . He raised over $1.9 million for breast cancer research during the campaign, in which he says he 'cycled into every town, jumped on my pink soapbox and screamed the message out to anyone that would listen' - from juvenile justice centres, nursing homes and bikie gangs to the more standard fare of schools, community events, gala balls and grass-root fundraisers. Connie and Samuel have also written a book about their life adventure together, a part memoir for Connie, which was released just last week. But they're not done yet. The siblings have admitted that they are currently concreting plans to unicycle around New Zealand while also planning a secret fundraiser in Australia that Samuel describes as 'an epic fundraiser that would no doubt trump our efforts on the unicycle'. The siblings say they are currently concreting plans to unicycle around New Zealand to raise $10 million for cancer research, while also planning a secret 'epic' fundraiser in Australia . 'If Anh Do is reading this, I really want to unicycle New Zealand with him,' Samuel said of the Vietnamese born comedian and actor. 'He can even come on a two-wheeler, but I get bored out of my brain on that thing eight to nine hours a day and can't think of a better bloke to ride with.' Since completing his challenge, Samuel admits that he considers himself a changed and lucky man, especially as his sister managed to buy some time with a hormone treatment that temporarily stabilised her condition. 'I've got a great hunger for life now, my curiosity has been reactivated and I'm finding great joy and optimism in saying ""yes"". I'm a better person because of my sister's illness and what she's decided to do about it,' Samuel said. 'Connie has experienced a great year of stability, but the cancer is active again so things are going downhill a little. Obviously we are all, as always, alert and trying not to be alarmed.' Love Your Sister, the book, can be bought by visiting www.loveyoursister.org.","Samuel Johnson rode 15,000km around Australia on a unicycle to raise $1.9 million for cancer research .

"An award winning 'small house' built above a garage in a back lane of Sydney's Surry Hills sold for $1.88 million last night, nine days before its planned auction. The five-story home, which has been called the 'house of millimetres' in the design world, was constructed in 2010 on a 44-square metre car park on a street corner just three car spaces wide. Designer and previous owner Domenic Alvaro said the sale was 'the end of an amazing journey' for he and his wife, who have decided to move to a bigger home after having their second child. 'The project has a lot of love and a lot of passion in it and I hope the buyer will feel that,' Mr Alvaro told the Daily Mail Australia. 'It's just a gem of a house in the best part of town.' At almost $43,000 per square metre, it is also one of Sydney's most expensive. Scroll down for video . The five-level Small House in Surry Hills was built above a garage three car spaces wide on the corner of this inner-city laneway in Sydney's Surry Hills . Selling agent Ivan Bresic said the price was a record for a one-bedroom property in Surry Hills and that this was due to its designer build. A close comparison, he told the Daily Mail Australia, was a similar 100 square metre one-bedroom property in Printers Lane in Sydney's Darlinghurst which went for a recent $1.1 million. But according to property expert Ross Elliott of the Residential Development Council, 'there's really not many Big Small sales like this anywhere else in Australia.' The compact design, which won Alvaro a string of architecture awards, including the World Architecture Festival's World House of the Year in 2011, was inspired by architects in Tokyo and other parts of the world who work with small spaces using prefabricated concrete that can be assembled on site in a matter of days. The rooftop terrace of can be used as another living room and enjoys uininterupted city views . Alvaro said he was on the lookout for a challenging inner-city space to work with when he came across the car park in Belmore Lane. He bought the site back in 2008 for $230,000. 'I definitely wanted to dabble in developing unconventional land because that's where my skills are; in taking blank sites and transforming them into beautiful, liveable homes,' said Alvaro, a Principle at Architecture Firm Woods Baggot. The one-bedroom Small House covers 200 square metres over five floors and includes  a rooftop terrace, two bathrooms and a garage. It has living areas on  three levels and enjoys panoramic city views from the top floor and luxury interior features like a marble kitchen and basalt stone floors. Alvaro said the small house philosophy is to build upwards rather than outwards and to create spaces which are flexible enough to be used in different ways. Domenic Alvaro and wife Sue in the 'Small House' open plan kitchen . Large north facing windows fill each level of the small house with natural light . The use of commercial prefabricated concrete in tight  residential sites was something relatively new in Australia when the house was built in 2010. 'It enabled a really solid construction that we were actually able to  put together in just four days', said Alvaro, even though he spent about eight months on the actual designs. 'It takes a lot of effort and conviction to design, plan and deliver something so unconventional like this; we really pushed the boundaries,' he said. 'I now look back and go ""bloody hell, did I really do this?""' The Small House has also featured on Grand Designs Australia and has won a number of  local awards including Residential Architecture (Houses) and Small Project Architecture at the NSW Australian Institute of Architects Awards; and New House under 200 square metres at the annual Houses Awards.

What's next for the award-winning architect? Alvaro recently completed a cottage for a friend in New Zealand and says he has plans for a row house for his family in Sydney's Inner West. 'Professionally, I'm focusing on small apartments, mostly in Sydney,' he said, adding 'I can't share too much as  plans are still a bit under wraps.' 'But It's a really exciting time to be working in this space,' he said. 'New legislation is now permitting a smaller apartment market. We've been saying for a while now: ""Look, a one-bedroom or studio apartment can actually be much smaller if it's designed well; they can have a level of luxury and joinery and quality finish but in a small offer that is more affordable and practical for inner city living.' Multi-function rooms make the most of tight spaces in the Small House . Luxury interior finishes including marble benchtops and basalt stone floors set this award-winning home apart .

"The full extent of George Osborne’s stealth tax raid on pensioners was laid bare yesterday. Around 700,000 people turning 65 next year will be hit the hardest – losing £323 annually with the end of age-related income allowances. In all, the ‘granny tax’ will take £3.5billion from the pockets of more than 4.4million pensioners. Senior Tories have denounced it privately as the Chancellor’s biggest blunder. Burden: Around 700,000 people turning 65 next year will be hit the hardest - losing £323 annually with the end of age-related income allowances . The new rules are so arbitrary that some OAPs will lose far more than others born a day before them. Ros Altmann of Saga said: ‘Middle-class pensioners are outraged. My inbox is full of angry emails from those who did save for their future but are now hit. ‘The message of this Budget is, don’t bother to save for the future and if you’re too old to work any more you don’t count.’ The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Chancellor should have given advance notice of his plan to freeze the £10,500 tax-free allowance for the over-65s. Lord Tebbit described it as an assault on pensioners who have put money aside. ‘The freezing and gradual abolition of the age-related tax allowance is an error,’ said the Tory grandee. ‘It hurts those who have saved enough for modest pensions. It is unfair and lousy politics.’ Part of the justification for the move was the promise of a more generous state pension of around £140 a week. But this is not expected to be introduced until 2016 – and even then only for those who hit pension age at the time. That means that those who retired between these dates would lose both a higher allowance and the better pension – a double attack on their incomes. This will affect around 2.8million pensioners – 700,000 a year for four years. Existing pensioners are likely to be forced to see out their days living on the current state pension which, from April, will pay £107.45 a week. Senior Tories have denounced the so-called Granny Tax privately as the Chancellor's biggest blunder . The IFS found that all pensioners with incomes of between £10,800 and £26,200 turning 65 next year would lose out on £323 as a result of the Budget. They will be part of the 4.4million to be punished, with average losses of £83. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘The most unfair part of George Osborne’s tax raid on pensioners is the effect on people turning 65 next year. ‘How can it be right that someone born a day too late loses over £300 with little advance warning? Just as on his botched changes to child benefit, the Chancellor has simply not thought through the effect of his policies on ordinary people.' The poorest pensioners are not affected since they do not pay income tax and the richest pensioners do not get the allowance in any case. In Wednesday’s Budget statement, the Chancellor said no one would be out of pocket as a result of his changes since the tax allowance for the over-65s would be frozen rather than cut. He boasted that it was an attempt to simplify the tax system. But Paul Johnson of the IFS said Mr Osborne ‘should have avoided dressing up what is clearly a tax increase as merely a simplification’. He suggested that, for the change to be presented as a reform rather than a tax hike, it should have been delayed until personal allowances reach £10,000 – expected to happen in 2014 or 2015. But in a rare boost for the Chancellor, the IFS said there was a justification for making cuts on pensioners because they had done better than younger people from the Government’s austerity measures. Mr Johnson said: ‘Our analysis shows that they have lost considerably less from recent tax and benefit changes than any other demographic group. And over the past decade and more pensioner incomes have risen faster than those of the working age population. ‘This looks like a relatively modest tax increase on a group hitherto well sheltered from tax and benefit changes.’ David Cameron dismissed claims that pensioners were going to be hit, calling it a ‘fair Budget for all our people’. Speaking to reporters in Bradford, the Prime Minister pointed to the future increases in the state pension. ‘The first thing is that every granny around the country is going to be benefiting from the biggest ever increase in the pension that comes in in April – an extra £5.30 a week. ‘And at the same time, the Budget also delivered a tax cut for 24million people in our country, and also we’ve now taken 2million of the lowest paid people out of tax altogether. It’s a good Budget for our economy and it’s a fair Budget for all our people.’ A Treasury spokesman said: ‘This is an important simplification. It’s sensible to have a single tax-free personal allowance for everyone. ‘The poorest half of pensioners will still pay no tax in 2013/14 and nobody will pay more tax in cash terms than they do today. ‘Compared to the plans the Government inherited, an existing pensioner with a full basic state pension will gain more from the triple lock in each of the next three years than they will lose from the age-related allowances freeze.’ Mr Cable said the major feature of yesterday’s Budget was the large increase in the personal tax allowance to £9,205 from April 2013. He said: ‘We are giving people the freedom to choose how to spend their own money, not taking it from them and then giving it back in a complex, means-tested system of tax credits.’ And defending the changes to pensioners’ tax allowances, Mr Cable said the Budget was transferring £1.7billion to pensioners –against £360million taken away by the allowances changes. He said pensioners on lower incomes would benefit from the growing personal tax allowances under the simplified system, while increases in the basic state pension would give cash in real terms. The Business Secretary said: ‘There is a small group of people, frankly my contemporaries, who have high retirement income and considerable asset wealth and it is right in principle they should pay a bit more. There is a group of people who are not wealthy, on not particularly high income, and who could be affected to a limited extent as a result of inflation eroding the value of the allowances. Those people will benefit enormously from the increase in the basic pension.’ Mr Cable accused Labour of failing to fix the state pension system, ensuring the value of the pension fell back further and further from incomes. Mr Osborne stuck to a previous promise to increase the allowance to £10,500 for those aged 65, and £10,660 for the oldest pensioners. This meant the over-65s appeared to be gaining an extra tax break. But what he didn’t make clear was that by freezing allowances after this, any pensioner who already pays tax will get only 80p for every £1 increase in their pension. This is because the amount they can earn tax free will not change and, as a result, every extra pound in income above the allowance is taxed at the basic rate of 20 per cent.","Around 700,000 people turning 65 next year will be hit the hardest .

"Sandwiched between a Starbucks and a charity shop and filled with overflowing rubbish bins, this dank and dingy alleyway is far from the perfect home. But the unusual south London plot captured the imagination of one buyer desperate for a place in the city and fetched £260,000 at auction. The narrow lane, which measures 900sq. ft, on Northcote Road in Battersea was snapped up for more than five times its guide price of £55,000 when it went up for sale earlier this week. Cramped: The passageway is between a Starbucks and a charity shop on Northcote Road in Battersea. The narrow lane, which is partially covered, fetched more than five times its original guide price at auction . Filthy: The alleyway, which sold for £260,000 at auction is currently used as a dumping ground for rubbish . Dingy: A view of the road from inside the alleyway reveals just how dark it is beneath the brick archway . Neat and narrow: This site plan from Wandsworth Council shows the alleyway, circled, wedged between two other retail sites. Planning permission allows for the construction of a first-floor extension . The new owner will be hoping to transform the dark passageway into something more appealing. Planning permission included in the price means that it can be converted to a comfortable residential space and there is even suggestion that it could be used as an artist's studio. And while the neat site does not come with any outdoor space - the bustling south London road is just a short walk to both Clapham and Wandsworth Commons. In an online description, Savills Auctions said: 'Local amenities are available along the length of Northcote Road, including its popular street market.' Planning permission granted by Wandsworth Council allows for the construction of a first-floor extension beneath the covered portion of the alleyway that can extend out to the open-air rear. The building work means that the new owner could build a comfortable 900sq. ft home, a spacious artist's studio - or a combination of the two. To keep the new property on the busy south London road safe, the planning permission also allows for the installation of entrance gates and a ground-floor lobby. Chris Coleman Smith, director of Savills Auctions, told the Evening Standard that he was only a 'little bit' surprised by the amount the alleyway sold for as it had 'attracted a lot of interest'. He said: 'This is a classic example of a property finding its value in the auction room. The area around the property is red hot. 'We have sold all sorts of stuff over the years but this is maybe one of the most unique lots.' At £260,000, the partially-covered alleyway comes in at just £15,000 less than the average current value of a home in the UK - which comes in at £275,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. For the same price, property-hunters could buy a five-bedroom detached home in picturesque Yorkshire or a spacious four-bedroom semi-detached home in Suffolk. The purchase of the narrow street is the latest in a string of extraordinary London property deals. Last month, Britain's smallest home, which is less than half the size of an average train carriage and measures just 188 sq. ft, was sold for more than a quarter of a million pounds. Video courtesy of London Live. Room to improve: The new buyer will be allowed to develop both the area beneath the archway and the small open-air section at the back of the service package, seen in the picture above . Rubbish real estate: Disused cardboard boxes and waste from nearby businesses line the floor of the alleway . Dank: In this picture taken of the alleyway this week, the property looks far from a comfortable place to live . The tiny flat in Islington, north London - which is so compact that the front door opens underneath the bed - went on sale for £275,000 and was bought after an extraordinary amount of interest. And earlier this month, a one-car garage off the King's Road in Chelsea, central London, measuring just 11ft by 7ft, became the UK's most expensive garage when it sold for £550,000. For the same price, property hunters could buy a pretty semi-detached home with a garden in Suffolk. The quaint vine-covered house boasts four bedrooms and a 'cottage-style garden'. Further north, £260,000 would fetch a five-bedroom detached home in a picturesque Yorkshire village. And the buyer would have enough money leftover to make sure that upgrades could be made. While those looking to maintain a metropolitan lifestyle could look at the outskirts of Manchester - where £260,000 is enough for a four-bedroom family home with a garage and beautiful conservatory. Or, if the potential buyer wanted to stay closer to London, £250,000 could buy a two-bedroom bungalow in the popular commuter town of Woking, Surrey - less than an hour from central London by train.

"Two dedicated dog owners have created a tear-jerking video that shows the incredible resiliency of man’s best friend and their dedication and love for their cancer-stricken companion. Viewers are taken on an emotional journey as Sheridan the dog loses a leg to cancer yet remains the same playful and happy-go-lucky pooch that he was before his life-altering surgery. Sheridan still loves to roll in the sand, leap into pools, obey commands for dog biscuits and chase his owner’s remote-controlled drone at their home on the Caribbean island of Grenada. Happy-go-lucky: Sheridan the dog leaps into the pristine waters on the Caribbean island of Grenada . Last July, Sheridan was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, the most common bone tumour found in dogs. His right forelimb had to be amputated to slow the spread of cancer and prevent pain. Despite having cancer Sheridan looks like a normal, healthy dog when the six-minute video begins with a look at his life before his leg was amputated. He runs on the beach, swims at a waterfall with one of his owners and plays with another dog in the sand. But the video takes a heart-wrenching turn as viewers are taken into the operating room while veterinarians remove the loveable dog’s right front leg. Sheridan was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, the most common bone tumour found in dogs, last July . Veterinarians sedate Sheridan before amputating his right forelimb . After surgery Sheridan underwent six treatments of chemotherapy and scans . His owners, Morgan and Zach, who are originally from Indiana, were granted access as they are attending veterinary school at St George’s University. After the surgery the video shows the heart-warming moment three-legged Sheridan – with a massive surgical scar – is greeted by his owners and leaps out of his cage to return home.

"It’s one of the nation’s hottest export success stories – hundreds of tons of chillies grown on British farms are being sold to countries renowned for their fiery cuisine. Already this year, well over 600 tons of chillies produced by UK growers have been exported to countries that include Pakistan, India, Mexico and Brazil. This year’s chilli exports are expected to be double last year’s, bringing £1.3million into the economy, according to official figures. Burning ambition: Grower Gerald Fowler tends to his super-fiery chilli crop . Gerald Fowler, who runs the Chilli Pepper Company in Cark-in-Cartmel, Cumbria, said: ‘It’s gone crazy and I’m selling to every corner of the Earth. I’d never have believed I’d be selling to India, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil and America. ‘It’s going to be our best year ever. We are selling seeds and chillies and all they want is the hottest. No one is interested in a mild chilli.’ The growth in the popularity of spicy foods in the UK has prompted growers to experiment with different varieties, creating some of the hottest and most sought-after chillies in the world. At the Conservative conference last week, Mayor of London Boris Johnson praised British ingenuity for growing ‘weapon-strength chillies’. Already this year, well over 600 tons of chillies produced by UK growers have been exported to countries that include Pakistan, India, Mexico and Brazil . And Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Chefs from Delhi to Texas are reaching for British chillies to put the spice into their curries and their Tex-Mex. It’s an extraordinary testament to the skill, creativity and can-do attitude that make our food and farming industry world-leading. Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss has praised the country's chilli growers . ‘People may not think of chillies as a traditional British crop, but it’s increasingly hot business. This is fantastic news and it’s further proof of the reputation British producers are gaining around the world for high quality and innovation.’ The Chilli Pepper Company was started by Mr Fowler’s father 20 years ago from one chilli grown in a pot, and today makes £250,000 a year in a business based around a tiny 16ft by 8ft greenhouse. ‘I think chilli is the new garlic,’ said Mr Fowler. ‘Chefs are helping to make it popular and they are putting it in all of their concoctions. ‘We’ve also being helped by the internet. When we first started, people sent postal orders and cheques in the post to buy a plant. Now, it’s online orders. We’ve expanded and employ five people here and another ten people grow chillies for us around the country.’ The firm gained an international reputation in 2010 when its Naga Viper chilli pepper was judged the hottest in the world. The record-breaking chilli scored 1.35 million units on the Scoville heat unit scale (Shus). This measures the heat of a chilli by the presence of the chemical compound capsaicin. It has now been replaced as the world’s hottest chilli by the Carolina Reaper, grown in the US, which scores 1.5 million Shus. ‘We’re hoping to beat that,’ Mr Fowler said. ‘I’m trialling a cross between a Carolina Reaper and a Naga Viper, but the project is going to take another two or three years.’ Meanwhile, the Dorset Naga is ranked as the world’s third hottest chilli. It was developed by Joy and Michael Michaud, who run Sea Spring Seeds, near Bridport. Mrs Michaud said: ‘We sell online and our chillies and seeds are sent all over the world, particularly to South America. ‘It has really taken off.’","More than 600 tons of chillies produced by UK growers exported this year .

"Sales of the iPhone 6 may have broken records globally but this was not the case in Australia. The manufacturer of the smartphone, Apple, said it sold more than 10 million iPhone 6s in the first weekend of its September 19 launch, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. But this September's sales figures in Australia for Apple in-store and online fell short of meeting last year's in the same month by 300,000 units. iPhone 6 sales broke records around the world but this was not the case in Australia . Data collated by Pocketbook showed Apple made more than 60 per cent of its annual revenue from its the selling of its gadgets in the first four months after a new product is released. In December alone, spending on Apple devices is more than five times as much as any month from January to August. Chief executive of the smartphone manufacturer Tim Cook said he was confident global sales of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus would have been higher if supply could meet demand, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. Apple was also hit with a record number of pre-orders, amounting to four million on September 12 when the option became available. According to Pocketbook, sales for Apple products fell in September this year compared to last year in the same month . The launch of the iPhone 6 in Australia - the first country to start selling the new products - saw thousands line up for hours to get their hands on the smartphones. It also emerged many people who had lined up for days to be among the first in the world to buy the new iPhone 6 say they planned to sell them in China for triple the price they paid. But the staggered release of the iPhone 6 meant it was not available in some countries - including the world's largest mobile market, China, where Apple is yet to announce a release date. The basic model iPhone 6 16GB sells for $869 in Australia. It had appeared on Chinese e-commerce sites, such as sea.taobao.com - where it is selling for 12,000 renminbi, or around $2,175,00. Customers outside Apple's flagship store in Sydney told Daily Mail Australia on September 19 Chinese buyers are paying up to three times the retail price for the top of the line model iPhone 6 Plus 128GB - just 50 were released at the George Street Apple store.","Apple sold more than 10 million iPhone 6s in the first weekend of its launch .

"Pennsylvania's attorney general has blamed a former female prison worker for her own rape after she was attacked in jail by a dangerous criminal. The 24-year-old victim was attacked by Omar Best inside Rockview Prison, Pennsylvania. During her 27-minute long ordeal, Best strangled his victim until she was unconscious before raping her. CCTV footage showed that Best left the room where the attack occurred of his own accord. Prison staff later found the victim unconscious on the floor. Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane, left, is defending the case claiming that the female prison worker victim was partly responsible for being raped by violent attacker Omar Best, right . The victim is suing the state and the former prison superintendent for damages. However, in response to the claim, the attorney general's office filed a 13-page document citing 'contributory negligence' on behalf of the victim. Best, 36, was jailed for life following the attack. He was in prison serving a rape sentence at the time of the attack and had an earlier conviction for attempted rape from 1996 which had been reduced to indecent assault. The victim's lawyer, Clifford Rieders, of Williamsport, criticised the tactic on Wednesday. He said: 'It's total bunk. It's throwing something out there so they can have it on the record. They have no evidence of that.' 'It has no substance, but it's just the way some lawyers litigate. He added that it's 'insulting to women generally who face rape cases only to be told that it's their fault'. According to testimony at Best's trial and her suit, the rape victim was hired to work in the prison's central office on June 10, 2013. Best, pictured, attacked the woman after entering the prison office to empty a rubbish bin . Best, pictured, was serving a sentence for raping a woman at the time of his latest attack . By mid-July she had told prison officials that inmates sometimes entered hallways and stairs that led to her office and, specifically, that she was uncomfortable when Best entered her office. Though Best wasn't specifically assigned to work there, he would sometimes enter to empty the trash before he finally raped her on July 25, 2013. According to court documents filed by Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane: 'Some or all of the damages plaintiff have alleged are in part, or substantially due, to the acts of third parties other than the answering defendants, and/or plaintiff acted in a manner which in whole or in part contributed to the events which led to the damages plaintiff has alleged in her complaint.' Best was jailed for life on September 12 under the three-strike rule. According to the Centre Daily Times, Best's criminal history went back 23 years, including several violent attacks against women. The victim's lawsuit claims that Best had been transferred to Rockview after assaulting a female prison worker at another institution.","Omar Best attacked the 24-year-old woman inside the office of a prison .

"A 17-year-old girl is recovering  after a buck struck her car while she was driving and impaled her jaw bone with its antler. High school senior Tori Henry needed five-hour surgery after the freak accident in Jonesboro, Arkansas last Wednesday but is expected to leave the hospital today. The teenager was driving on one of the city's busiest streets when the five-point buck tried to jump over her car - but smashed into the driver's window and impaled her face with its antler. Despite the terrifying experience, Tori stayed surprisingly calm, her mother told KAIT. Scroll down for video . Injuries: Tori Henry is pictured after a deer smashed into her car window and impaled her jaw with its antler .

"A group of women, outraged that a couple's gay wedding had been ruined by a homophobic bigot invited the happy couple back to California for a second ceremony. Gary Jackson and Oscar De Las Salas tried to get married on Cononado Island near San Diego almost two months ago when a man roared abuse at them from an apartment window. When a group of local women, described as 'The Island Ladies', heard about the incident, they emailed Jackson and De Las Salas and invited them back to their community to make amends.

Better still, the ladies arranged a new wedding ceremony for the couple and 300 guests, with local businesses donating towards the good cause. De Las Salas told NBC Los Angeles 'I hear [the heckling] and then he grabs me by the hand and said it’s alright we're ok,.' According to Jackson: 'The ceremony was over, taking photos all we could think of was that guy and those condos where that person was staying.' Local lawyer Alissa Kerr heard about the abuse and decided to act as she felt the homophobic abuse had no place in a community like Coronado. She established a Facebook page where local businesses made donations for the 'do-over ceremony'. De Las Salas added: 'What we're experiencing today is the biggest expression of love someone can have, the biggest expression of a community gathering themselves together to make it right.' The second ceremony was held at the Loews Coronado Bay Resort in front of 300 guests - many of whom did not know the happy couple before the event. The couple, pictured, from Phoenix, Arizona, said they had no idea what to expect on their return to Coronado .","Gary Jackson and Oscar De Las Salas married in Coronado in August .

"'Miracle man': Jonno Miller, 68, battled liver cancer for four years after being told it was terminal . A father-of-three who was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer died in a car crash on the same day he was given the all clear. Jonno Miller, 68, was hailed by doctors as a 'miracle man' after defying the disease for four years. He was killed last week when a lorry smashed into his car on the A30, near Tolvaddon Downs, Cornwall - before he could read the letter that told him he was cancer-free. Mr Miller and his wife Angie, 48, were driving back to their home in Mount's Nay, near Penzance, Cornwall, last Friday when their green Ford Galaxy was in collision with an HGV lorry on a layby. Mrs Miller, who was driving, survived the accident with minor injuries but Mr Miller, who was sitting in the front seat, was killed instantly. The lorry driver was unhurt. Mrs Miller later arrived home to find an unopened letter from the hospital, addressed to her husband, that said his body was cancer-free. The couple, originally from Northampton had remote Mount's Nay after Mr Miller's diagnosis because he did not want his three children and two stepchildren to see him dying. He became a patient of specialist Dr. Harry Dalton at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Treliske who decided to persevere with his treatment, despite his terminal diagnosis. Mrs Miller said: 'Jonno became known as Dr Dalton's miracle man. His team at Treliske gave me another four years of love and happiness for which I'm eternally grateful.' The Millers' lodger and close friend Ciaran Cardell, a fisherman, said: 'He was such a genuine, nice person - he would go out of his way to help anybody. 'He was the nicest bloke I've ever met and I'm more proud than I can say to call him father - he called me son and I called him dad.

"When chef David Nicholls was called to see his 18-year-old son lying in a hospital bed paralysed, he made him a promise that all the doctors advised against, he said he would fix it. But now Mr Nicholls, who can name Heston Blumenthal and Nigella Lawson among his friends, may be one step closer to realising the dream for his son. A foundation set up by the chef to support spinal research has just funded pioneering surgery to enable Darek Fidyka, a Polish firefighter who was paralysed after he spinal cord was severed when he was stabbed, to walk again. The surgery - hailed as world first hailed more impressive than putting a man on the Moon - could mean that spinal injuries previously deemed incurable could be cured and people left paralysed, like Mr Nicholls' son, could one day walk again. Scroll down for video . David Nicholls (left) and his son Daniel who was paralysed in a swimming accident in Bondi Beach in 2003 .

Darek Fidyka (right) was completely paralysed from the waist down and is now able to walk again after surgery . Daniel Nicholls has not walked for the last ten years after he hit his head on a sandbank while swimming in the sea off Bondi Beach in Australia in 2003 during what was meant to be a celebration after finishing his exams. The accident severed his spinal cord and left him with a broken neck, meaning since then he has been unable to walk or feel his legs. He also has limited movement in his arms. His father told The Times: 'It was the most devastating thing in my life, seeing a fit, healthy, lean, good looking 18 year old boy in bed unable to move.' Against the advice of doctors who criticised him for giving the teenager false dreams, Mr Nicholls promised his son he would find a solution. Mr Nicholls, a former chef, set up the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation to fund research into spinal cord injuries . Daniel Nicholls pictured with his girlfriend Hayzee, Daniel had become paralysed after the accident in Australia . The 40-year-old fireman from Poland was paralysed from the waist down after being stabbed four years ago leaving him paralysed below the waist . The former chef set up the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation and managed to raise £1m by producing a cookery book with the help of celebrity chefs including Lawson and Blumenthal. He set up the foundation to raise funds exclusively for basic medical research in the hope that a way of treating spinal injuries could be found. He met Geoffrey Raisman, of University College London, who had previously managed to reverse paralysis in rats by transplant cells from the nose to their spines. This graphic shows the steps making up the procedure, which allowed Mr Fidyka to walk again. Scientists transplanted olffactory ensheathing cells into the damaged part of the spinal chord, to grown new nerve cells . Scientists from University College London (UCL) pioneered the breakthrough procedure. It was designed to enable Darek Fidyka to walk again, after his spinal cord was sliced in half during a stabbing four years ago, leaving him paralysed below the waist. The procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or OECs – from the nose to the spinal cord. OECs assist the repair of damaged nerves in the nose that transmit smell messages to the brain. The cells were transplanted into the  spinal cord, using 100 micro injections across the site of the injury. A small piece of nerve tissue, which was taken from the ankle, was grafted onto the 'gap' in the spinal cord to act as a scaffold for the spinal neurons to extend, as guided by the OECs. This enabled the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together – something that was previously thought to be impossible. Three months after the operation, Mr Fidyka began to gain muscle in his left leg and regained sensations in it,  such as hot and cold, and pins and needes. A year later, he is able to walk again, with the aid of parallel bars. Mr Nicholls was alerted to the research going on in Poland by Prof Raisman and decided to use the money to find a trial led by Powel Tabakow, a Polish neurosurgeon. He said the success has left him hopeful for the future. Daniel has not benefitted from the foundation but if a cure is developed in future based on the trial, Mr Nicholls hopes his son will be 'near the front of the queue.' Mr Fidyka, 38, had been paralysed after he was stabbed  in 2010 leaving him with severed spinal nerves. He had suffered damage similar to that of actor Christopher Reeve, whose spine was severed from his skull after he fell off a horse in 1995. While some victims of partial spinal injury have recovered, a complete break was generally assumed to be irreparable. His condition had not improved after six months of physiotherapy and he was put forward as a candidate for the trial. The team worked with Mr Fidyka and removed cells from his nose, which communicate with the brain. The procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or OECs – from the nose to the spinal cord. OECs assist the repair of damaged nerves in the nose that transmit smell messages to the brain. Two weeks later, the cells were transplanted into the spinal cord, using 100 micro injections across the site of the injury. A small piece of nerve tissue, which was taken from the ankle, was grafted onto the spinal cord to act as a scaffold for the spinal neurons to extend, as guided by the OECs. This enabled the ends of severed nerve fibres to grow and join together across the 'gap' – something that was previously thought to be impossible. A few months later Mr Fidyka started developing muscle and sensation in his legs. Two years later he is able to walk outside the rehabilitation centre in Wrocklaw with the aid of a frame and can drive a car. Professor Raisman said: ‘The observed wisdom is that the central nervous system cannot regenerate damaged connections. I’ve never believed that.’ He stressed that what had been achieved was a leap forward beyond ‘plasticity’ – the re-wiring of the remaining connections. He compared that method to motorists finding other routes around a closed section of motorway, adding: ‘What we’re doing is repairing the motorway.’ Speaking on BBC Radio Four's Today Programme, Professor Raisman said: 'This [procedure] opens the door, which I had always been knocking at - to see that our nervous system has the ability to repair itself. ‘This is the beginning of a repair for spinal injuries and other types of injuries - including stroke. ‘The idea that the nervous system can repair itself in rats and in one man - there’s no reason to restrict this to just the spinal cord. It opens the door to a future which is terrifyingly large. ‘We’ve climbed two mountains and we are now at the foot of the (next) mountain. We have knowledge which could be of great value, we can’t stop now.' While the trial will need to be repeated with other patients and could take up to ten years before it becomes an accepted therapy, Mr Nicholls is hopeful for the help it could offer his son. The procedure involved transplanting olfactory ensheathing cells – or OECs – from the nose to the spinal cord where they allowed nerve cells to regrow and bridge the 'gap' in the severed spinal cord . Professor Geoffrey Raisman had met Mr Nicholls and told him about the trial in Poland to treat paralysis . He added: 'When you realise you could be on the verge of realising your ambition, that's unique. 'We must never be arrogant or cocky about what we've done, but it's quite remarkable.' Professor Geoffrey Raisman, whose team at UCL first discovered the technique, said: ‘We believe that this procedure is the breakthrough which, as it is further developed, will result in a historic change in the currently hopeless outlook for people disabled by spinal cord injury.’ He described Mr Fidyka’s recovery as ‘more impressive than man walking on the Moon’. Professor Raisman, whose work is also published in the journal Cell Transplantation today, said: ‘[Mr Fidyka] can get around with a walker and he’s been able to resume much of his original life, including driving a car. 'He’s not dancing, but he’s absolutely delighted.’ He continued: ‘The number of patients who are completely paralysed is enormous. 'There are millions of them in the world. If we can convince the global neurosurgeon community that this works then it will develop very rapidly indeed.’ Dr Pawel Tabakow, of the Wroclaw Medical University in Poland, said: ‘We estimated that without this treatment, our patient’s recovery chances were less than 1 per cent. 'However, we observed a gradual recovery of both sensory and motor function that began four months after the surgery.’ The scientists hope to treat up to 10 patients in the next few years if they can secure funding. The research, funded by the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation and UK Stem Cell Foundation, will be featured in a Panorama programme on BBC 1 tonight.","David Nicholls set up the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation to fund research .

"Steve Backshall has finally met his match - in his Strictly Come Dancing partner Ola Jordan . He's wrestled poisonous snakes, dived with great white sharks and been bitten by a rampaging reptile. So it might surprise you to learn that adventurer and children’s TV star Steve Backshall has finally met his match – in his Strictly Come Dancing partner Ola Jordan. The muscle-bound presenter has lodged a complaint with the BBC, claiming she ‘bullied’ him in gruelling practice sessions. The pair have been assigned a chaperone to follow them around after he refused to be alone with the 32-year-old Polish-born dancer. The programme’s bosses were forced to step in after he alleged that she had dented his confidence with her ‘rude and impatient’ manner. Last night a source close to the show explained: ‘Steve is a very bouncy personality, up for any challenge, but Ola’s harsh treatment has flattened him and made him lose confidence. ‘She was very rude and impatient when he found it difficult to master the shapes for last Saturday’s Charleston. ‘Her choreography and tuition was so tough, Steve resorted to asking other people to show him what he had to do. 'Ola is a cold and very distant personality, who refuses to mix with Steve’s family and friends,’ the source added. It is understood that Mr Backshall complained directly to one of the Strictly producers after last Saturday’s Halloween-themed Charleston. Bosses called Mrs Jordan in for a meeting this week and agreed that she and Mr Backshall will be accompanied at all times while they remain in the competition. Even before his complaint, there were signs that Mr Backshall, 41, was struggling to keep up with the demanding pace set by Mrs Jordan. Last week they were placed near the bottom of the leader-board and the judges remarked on how hard she appeared to have pushed him. After the wildlife presenter performed a series of forward rolls, complicated lifts and a cartwheel, Darcey Bussell said he was ‘over-challenging’ himself. Bruno Tonioli criticised Mrs Jordan’s routine for being ‘over-ambitious’ and Len Goodman added: ‘I think you need guts to do that, I really do. You kept going wrong.’ Ever since the competition started, Mr Backshall has struggled with the physical demands of the series. Last month, he told the Daily Mail he is unable to point the toes of his left foot because his ankle was fused in a near-fatal climbing accident in 2008. The action star, who was once bitten by a caiman, a reptile similar to a crocodile, revealed he was in ‘constant pain’ during training and took painkillers every day, adding: ‘It has absolutely broken me. 'You are training all day long on hard wooden floors wearing dance shoes that have no give in them at all, and no cushioning. The impact travels straight all the way through my body and I’m just falling apart.’ He also complained that the constant training affected his social life, saying: ‘I’m actually a little bit disappointed about the fact I’m supposedly in this incredibly high-profile position and I haven’t even got a minute to see my oldest and dearest friends, let alone to go on a date. ‘So it’s been rubbish for that. My dance partner is very, very happily married, so there is certainly no chance of me getting involved like that. 'And outside of that, not a chance. I have had zero social life.’ A show insider said: ‘Ola is a strict taskmaster. She sees real potential in Steve and thinks he could go the distance in the competition. 'She took the trophy with Chris Hollins and would love to win again – and with the mums’ and kids’ votes behind them, Steve is a real contender.’","Steve Backshall and Ola Jordan dance partners on Strictly Comes Dancing .

"As slow-moving lava approached a cemetery in a rural Hawaii town, Aiko Sato placed flowers at the headstone of the family plot she's tended to over the years, thinking it would be the last time she would see it. 'I made peace with myself,' Sato said Monday of visiting the Pahoa Japanese Cemetery on Oct. 23. A few days later, when lava smothered part of the cemetery the family believed the headstone was covered. But a photo taken Oct. 28 by a scientist documenting the lava's progress showed the headstone engraved with the Sato name standing in a sea of black lava. But a photo taken Oct. 28 by a scientist documenting the lava's progress showed the headstone engraved with the Sato name standing in a sea of black lava . 'I feel like it's a miracle,' Sato, 63, said. 'I know subsequent breakouts could cover the grave but at least I know it survived like a first round.' The lava's flow front stalled over the weekend and on Monday morning remained about 480 feet from Pahoa Village Road, which goes through downtown. A breakout of the flow remained about 100 yards from a house. Residents in the area have left or are preparing to leave. Sato's aunt, Eiko Kajiyama, 83, said she was heartbroken when she heard lava covered the cemetery. When she got the photo from the scientist, she hugged and thanked him, she recalled. The Hawaii Volcano Observatory wouldn't normally release such photos out of respect for the family of the deceased but provided the Sato family with a copy after a chance encounter between the family and an observatory scientist, observatory spokeswoman Janet Babb said in a statement. The Sato headstone  stands in a sea of black lava in a cemetery in Pahoa, Hawaii . 'During their conversation, the scientist recalled that he had just seen the family headstone the night before and was able to provide information about its status,' the statement said. 'Days later, while looking through HVO's photos, he realized that this particular image showed the Sato headstone and offered to provide a copy to the family.' Kajiyama said it feels like Pele, the Hawaiian volcano goddess, spared the headstone. 'We're so thankful we know the tomb is still there.' Her sister and brother, who died as infants, are buried there, along with the urns of her parents. Kajiyama knows a breakout of the flow could later cover the cemetery. And while her home is not in the lava's path, she bracing for the possibility it could reach her house. 'I'm just waiting day by day,' she said. 'With the lava, you don't know what's happening.'","A photo taken Oct. 28 by a scientist documenting the lava's progress showed the headstone engraved with the Sato name standing in a sea of black lava .

"Hannah Graham's parents have issued an emotional plea for help to find their daughter as police have found no trace of the 18-year-old more than three weeks after she went missing. Sue Graham thanked authorities for their efforts that have seen Jesse Matthew, the last person seen with Hannah on September 13, charged with abduction. But despite a large-scale investigation by multiple agencies and thousands of citizens, their daughter is still missing. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Distraught: Sue Graham cried and her husband John embraced her as they appealed for information . Search: Wearing badges with their daughter's face on them, they urged people to contact police with tips . Missing: Hannah Graham, 18, went missing on September 13 and police have found no trace of her since . 'Somebody listening to me today either knows where Hannah is, or knows someone who has that information,' Mrs Graham said today sitting beside her husband John, holding back tears. 'We appeal to you to come forward and tell us where Hannah can be found.' Two weeks ago, John Graham addressed the media, tearfully describing the 'nightmare' of not knowing where their only daughter is. Wearing badges with her daughter's face, Mrs Graham said today: 'John has already said that this is every parent's worst nightmare. 'That is true, but it is also a nightmare for our son, James, for Hannah's grandparents and other members of our family, as well as for all of Hannah's many friends here in Charlottesville and beyond.' She then implored anyone with information that has yet to be shared to call the police: 'Please, please, please help end this nightmare for all of us. Please help us to bring Hannah home.' 'Someone knows': Mrs Graham launched a direct appeal to someone listening who knows where she is . Nightmare: They thanked the thousands of strangers, friends and relatives that have supported them so far . Family: They explained how Hannah's disappearance has affected their son James (pictured) and others . A $100,000 reward has been offered by the University of Virginia and the city of Charlottesville, Hannah's hometown, for information that leads to the university student's return. Police have received thousands of tips, Mrs Graham informed reporters, expressing thanks from the family. She added: 'We would also like to thank the many, many kind people who have supported our family during this terrible ordeal through words, deeds, thoughts and prayers.' Matthew has been charged with abduction with intent to defile 18-year-old Hannah Graham, who disappeared after a night out with friends. He has also been linked to the murder of Alexis Murphy, 17, who was last seen in Nelson County, Virginia, on August 3, 2013. He has not been charged in the case, for which another man was found guilty. Charged: Jesse 'LJ' Matthews has been charged with abduction and attempt to defile Hannah Graham . Linked: Matthews has now been linked to the murders of Morgan Harrington (left) and Alexis Murphy (right) Matthew was scheduled to appear in court Thursday on the abduction charge and reckless driving charges after authorities said he sped away from a police station Sept. 20. The cases were postponed until December. Matthew was arrested in Texas last week after fleeing Virginia when police tried to question him in the disappearance of the 19-year-old University of Virginia student. The UVA nurses's assistant was the last person seen with Graham the night she went missing from downtown Charlottesville. Now investigators are looking into Matthew's movements over the last 12 years, focusing in on the more than six months he attended Christopher Newport University when two other young women disappeared without a trace. Search: The University of Virginia and City of Charlottesville have offered a $100 reward for information . No trace: Search teams have been patrolling the area for more than three weeks, even using drones . Matthew transferred to the Newport News school after being kicked out of Liberty University in Lynchburg in 2002 following allegations of rape.

"Still got it: North Pond Hermit Christopher . Knight, 47, in his Kennebec County Jail booking photo, has received a marriage proposal since his arrest . Three decades of sylvan solitude . haven't done any harm to Christopher Knight's mojo. The North Pond . Hermit has already received one marriage proposal since his arrest for . robbery earlier this month. Despite spending 27 years in the woods . of Maine with virtually no contact with other people, he's had plenty . trying to get close to him since bursting onto the headlines, officials . said. The offers Knight has received from . total strangers have prompted authorities to hike his bail by 5,000 per . cent, out of fears unscrupulous characters may try to exploit him. Someone called the jail where he's . being held with a marriage proposal while a man Knight didn't know . showed up on Saturday night offering to pay his $5,000 bail, The . Kennebec Journal reported. Worried Knight could be the target of . someone looking to capitalise on his notoriety, authorities charged him . with two additional counts of burglary and theft and increased his bail . to $250,000. Maine State Trooper Diane . Perkins-Vance told the Journal: 'My job is to ensure he does appear in . court. But there's a lot of people out there trying to exploit him.' District Attorney Maeghan Maloney said the big bail increase is unusual, but then this is an unusual case. 'The first concern is he might be a . flight risk,' she said. 'The second concern is the group of people who . are interested in posting bail for Mr Knight who are not from our state . and not members of his family. 'I will remain concerned for Mr Knight until he has an attorney helping him to navigate what is a new world to him.' Police said Knight may have been . responsible for as many as 1,000 burglaries over the years, raiding . cottages and campsites for food, cooking gear, sleeping bags, tents and . other goods to help him survive.

"A mother of five whose two-year-old son could die at any moment without round the clock care has told how she 'cried with happiness' after her campaign to stop her son’s help being cut was successful. Sarah Walton pleaded with the South Australian Government after they announced they were going to take away the highly-trained nurse who helps look after her son Zackary one day a week. Zackary has Treacher Collins Syndrome and also has a tracheostomy, which means his airway is compromised and could be obstructed at any moment. ‘We have to monitor him around the clock. It's already highly stressful and exhausting, and the one day of respite care allowed us to get by,’ Mrs Walton wrote on a change.org petition that has been signed by over 37,000 people. Two-year-old Zackary Walton has a tracheostomy, which means his airway is compromised and could be obstructed at any moment . Zackary is feed with a tube and his mother Sarah has to monitor him 24 hours a day . The 27-year-old found out on Friday morning that the National Disability Insurance Scheme will reinstate Zackary’s nurse after public outcry about the decision to cut his help. The family live in Mannum, in South Australia, about an hour and a half from Adelaide, and living rurally means their local hospital isn't trained to deal with emergencies for people with a tracheostomy. Mrs Walton, who also looks after her four other children at home while her husband works long hours to make ends meet, said the response has been ‘overwhelming’. ‘I cried I was so happy. It just means so much. It means I will be able to manage, to look forward to things and plan things again,’ Mrs Walton told Daily Mail Australia. On Mrs Walton’s moving change.org petition she wrote: ‘It's a scary weight to carry around, knowing that it's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive' Mother Sarah Walton pleaded with the South Australian Government after they announced they were going to take away the carer who helps look after her son Zachary one day a week . ‘I can do all the things everyone takes for granted again – one day a week - now without worrying about equipment or life or death. ‘I can get in the car and just breathe,’ she said. Mrs Walton is looking forward to being able to continue to take her other children, Patience, Imali, Briella and Kynan, to the movies and the beach one day a week in the school holidays. ‘Zackary can’t go anywhere like that so the other kids miss out,’ she said. ‘And I can get my hair done and go food shopping, pay the bills, get in and out of the car, have coffee and have time to organise birthday presents - just the little things.’ The mother described how Zackary ‘absolutely adores’ the nurse who looks after him one day a week and is ‘very particular with people’. Having a nurse for Zackary means Mrs Walton can take her four other children, Patience, Imali, Briella and Kynan, to the cinema and the beach in the school holidays . Zackary 'absolutely adores' the nurse who looks after him one day a week, Mrs Walton said . Over the next few years things are only going to get harder for the Walton family as Zackary begins major re-constructive surgery. The relief Mrs Walton feels knowing that a nurse will be there to help – at least for the foreseeable future – is palpable. ‘If anything it will get worse, not him but the issues he faces. For example he doesn’t get head colds, it goes straight through his lungs… he will be starting kinder soon and the more he goes out the more he gets sick,’ she said describing the challenges ahead. Treacher Collins syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of the head. It prevents the skull, cheek and jawbones from developing properly, causing facial defects and hearing loss. About one child in every 50,000 is affected. Problems range in severity from mild to very severe. In most cases, the child’s intelligence is normal. ‘He will also have some big surgery. From next year he will have a jaw… they will break it at the back and slowly turn it millimetres per day to bring it forward. He will also have his checks rebuilt and the surgery will go into adulthood. ‘There is no guarantee that he’ll ever not need a feeding tube.’ On Mrs Walton’s moving change.org petition she wrote: ‘It's a scary weight to carry around, knowing that it's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive. It's a weight parents of children with tracheostomies shouldn't have to bear just because they live in a rural area. ‘That's not right. We can't easily just move. We own our home, we'd need to uproot our other children, we have family here, we have hopes and dreams and aspirations for our future in this town. We just want to safely be able to include our son in that future.’ The family are still calling for more training about tracheostomy patients for doctors and nurses in rural hospitals. ‘This is my son's life at stake. It's also the lives of many other children with tracheostomy who are being ignored and neglected. Right now it seems like only a matter of time before the unthinkable happens, and someone like my son dies because of the lack of training and help the government is giving to rural tracheostomy patients,’ she wrote.

"As autumn sweeps in, so too do spiders hoping to cosy up in warm corners of your home as they search for a mate. And this year, experts have warned that these eight-legged creatures have got even bigger due to a mild summer and plenty of prey. Now scientists have created an app to help arachnophobes better understand the larger-than-usual creatures that are invading their homes. Scroll down for video . Scientists have created an app to help arachnophobes better understand the larger-than-usual creatures that are invading their homes. The Spider in Da House app, for Android and Apple, provides information and photos on the 12 most common spiders . The Spider in Da House app, for Android and iOS, provides information and photos on the 12 most common house spiders. This includes the rare spitting spider, a pale straw yellow arachnid with black markings and an extremely large domed head. Its method is unusual, in that it constructs no web and moves extremely slowly and it is only seen in older houses and rarely active in the daytime. Its enlarged head contains a set of modified poison glands that have evolved to produce a sticky glue. This is fired at the spider's prey, pinning it to the ground. The app, created by Gloucestershire University and the Society of Biology, also helps users to identify whether the spider's sex. A common spider is the Salticus, or 'jumping spider'; often found on the walls of houses. The jumping spider is easily recognised by its squared off head and two very large eyes that almost fill its 'face' Professor Adam Hart from the University of Gloucestershire said: 'By eating flies and other insects, spiders are not only providing us with a pest control service, but are important in ecosystems. Spiders are growing far larger in the city than in rural environments, researchers have said. They found that rather than thriving in areas with lots of vegetation, golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of Sydney, Australia, were larger and had more babies. The said an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame. 'City-dwelling orb-weaving spiders grow larger and could produce more offspring than their country cousins our research shows,' said Elizabeth Lowe of the University of Sydney, who led the research. This study shows invertebrates are sensitive to urbanisation but that not all species are negatively affected by living in cities. 'They often feed on the most common species, preventing a few species from becoming dominant. A more common spider is the Salticus, or 'jumping spider'; often found on the walls of houses. The jumping spider is easily recognised by its squared off head, and two very large eyes that almost fill its 'face'. It has the best vision of all of the spiders: seeing as well as we do and often looking up to examine humans. Unlike in most mammals, female spiders are often larger than males. The app, created by Gloucestershire University and the Society of Biology, also helps users to identify whether the spider's sex. Males are readily distinguished from females because males have what look like a pair of long thin 'boxing gloves' protruding from the front of their head end. These pedipalps, often just called palps, are used to transfer sperm into the female. Experts have warned that we'll be seeing more large spiders in our homes in the coming months. One of the spiders featured is the rare spitting spider, a pale straw yellow arachnid with black markings and an extremely large domed head (pictured) The mild summer has meant the eight-legged creatures have had plenty to eat, and very few have perished. With temperatures set to fall, experts from Sydney University have said the larger-than-usual house spiders will be heading indoors in the coming weeks to find a mate. Mr Lawrence Bee of the British Arachnological Society told the MailOnline that people often notice larger spiders this year as the cold weather drives them inside, with males hunting for females. But he agrees that the particularly mild summer we've had, not too hot and not too cold, will have given spiders access to more prey. 'So they are appearing a little bigger than average perhaps,' he says. He explained that there is a maximum size that most spiders reach, and its unlikely spiders in the UK will surpass this. Experts say larger-than-usual house spiders will head into UK homes soon. Professor Hart of the University of Gloucestershire said that the mild summer meant that more prey was available than usual. This means more spiders could grow to a larger size . However it may be that there are a larger quantity of large spiders, rather than a select few spiders being abnormally large. 'I think it's more a situation where they are active this time of year,' he continues. 'People are seeing them when they are obvious, and there might be more of them because last winter was quite mild. 'The conditions have been better so there may be more around, and it's just the fact people are seeing them more and being aware of them more. This is particularly the case for house spiders. ' A mild summer has given spiders more prey than usual (pictured is an Araneae spider spinning a web). Spiders often head inside at this time of year as males hunt for females. But Professor Hart said there is nothing to fear because they are a 'free pest control service'","'Spider in Da House' app has information on 12 common house spiders .

"They say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. But try telling that to this man, who used the front of his house to share a very public message to his ex. Robin Baker, 45, tied a homemade sign from an upstairs window after finding his estranged wife had stripped the property of all their belongings. The truck driver is in the process of divorcing his wife of 22 years, Jeanette Baker, 47, with whom he has three grown-up children. Acrimonious: Lorry driver Robin Baker, 45, has publicly vented his feelings towards his estranged wife on a homemade sign on the front of his house . A man scorned: The angry message was painted in bold black letters and hung up outside a house near Coalville, in Leicestershire . He said the pair mutually agreed to . end their relationship in April last year.But he claims he came home . last week to find the semi-detached property in Coalville, . Leicestershire, empty – with even the curtains and curtain rails . missing. Mr Baker said even the plants in the back garden of their £127,000 home had been uprooted and removed by his soon-to-be ex-wife. So, in an act of revenge, he used thick black paint to scrawl a message on a 6ft by 4ft sheet. The sign, which he has hung on the . front of the three-bedroom house, declares: ‘Woman you stripped this . house bare. I proved you a liar in court. Your [sic] getting **** all.’ He said he put up the banner to ‘inspire’ other men who have found themselves in the same situation. And he insisted he would rather have the home repossessed than see part of its value going to his estranged wife. When the former couple agreed to split, Mr Baker continued to live in the property and his wife moved out. But last week, he was shocked when he . returned home to find that the house had been completely emptied.

"Lorraine Bayless, an 87-year-old woman who was being cared for at the Glenwood Gardens retirement facility died after a nurse at the facility refused to perform CPR on her . Officials at a California adult living facility where a 87-year-odl resident has died after being denied CPR say that the woman who refused to revive the patient was not a nurse. The deceased, identified as Lorraine Bayless, collapsed in the dining room of the Glenwood Gardens independent senior living complex in Bakersfield on Tuesday. A staffer who identified herself as a nurse quickly called 911 from her cell phone, but refused to administer CPR, citing it was against company policy. Ms Bayless was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. 'Is there anybody that's willing to help this lady and not let her die,' dispatcher Tracey Halvorson asked on a dramatic seven-minute 911 tape released by the Bakersfield Fire Department. 'Not at this time,' said the woman, who didn't give her full name and said facility policy prevented her from giving the woman medical help. Christopher Finn, a spokesman for Brookdale Senior Living, which owns the Glenwood Gardens facility, told the Los Angeles Times that the unnamed caller was 'serving in the capacity of a resident services director, not as a nurse.' Finn would not say if the director was licensed as a nurse. It was later revealed that Ms Bayless . had no Do Not Resuscitate form on file. However, it is against the policy of . the retirement home to give CPR to residents of the independent living complex. The executive director at Glenwood, Jeffrey Toomer, said in a statement: ‘In the event of a health emergency at this independent living community, our practice is to immediately call emergency medical personnel for assistance and wait with the individual needing attention until such personnel arrives. ‘This is the protocol we followed,’ he said, adding that there would be an internal review of the incident.' Unlike nursing homes, independent living facilities like the one where Bayless had lived resemble senior apartment complexes and generally do not provide medical care. According to Toomer, all potential residents are informed about and agree to the facility's policy regarding CPR before they move in. Scroll down for video . Life choice: Ms Bayless's family have now reveal;ed she would not have wanted to be resuscitated . At the beginning of the Tuesday . morning call, the woman asked for paramedics to come and help the 87-year-old who had collapsed in the home's dining room and was barely breathing. Halvorson . pleaded for the caller to perform CPR, and after several refusals she . started asking her to find a resident, or a gardener, or anyone not . employed by the home to get on the phone, take her instructions and . help the woman. NBC affiliate KGET reported that Ms Bayless, a resident of Glenwood Gardens’ independent living facility, collapsed in the dining room Tuesday morning. The staffer previously believed to be a nurse, who identified herself as Colleen, called 911 and was patched to the Bakersfield Fire Dispatcher. The dispatcher begged for her to give the woman CPR, even though it was against her wishes and against the retirement community policy. Halvorson even requested the nurse to pass the phone to anyone else in the room – another senior citizen, or a gardener. The woman refused, saying: ‘I can’t do that.’ Policy: The director for Glenwood Gardens said the woman had signed a DNR form, and that it was against policy to administer CPR in independent living facilities . Obviously frustrated, the dispatcher . said: ‘I don’t understand why you’re not willing to help this patient… I . understand if your boss is telling you you can’t do it. ‘But…as a human being… you know…is there anybody that’s willing to help . this lady and not let her die,’ Halvorson asked. By the time EMT workers arrived on the scene about seven minutes after the 911 call was placed, Ms Bayless had no pulse and was not breathing. She was taken to Mercy Southwest Hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her daughter, who is a nurse, later told KGET that she was satisfied with the retirement home’s handling of the incident. First responders said that CPR often does not work on elderly patients, and even if they do survive, many end up suffering from severe health complications. Sgt. Jason Matson, of the Bakersfield Police Department, told Fox News that an investigation into the incident so far had not revealed criminal wrongdoing, but the probe is continuing. Reports of the tragedy have sparked outrage among advocates for the elderly, prompting calls for legislation to prevent this from happening in the future. Asemblywomna Mariko Yamada, chair of the California Assembly Aging and Long-term Care Committee, called Bayless' death a 'wake-up call.'","Lorraine Bayless, 87, collapsed in dining room of retirement facility .

"A gang of drug dealers have been jailed for more than 60 years after a huge police operation caught them moving high-purity cocaine in and out of the north of England. The 12 men were caught after the police surveillance operation - code-named Skyhawk - resulted in 200 officers raiding homes across County Durham and Merseyside in February last year. Gang boss Timothy John Lister, 40, was jailed for 16 years at Teesside Crown Court yesterday, while Sam Turnbull, 36, received 11 years and two months and Alan Crawford, 42, was sentenced to nine years. Gang boss Timothy John Lister, 40, (left) was jailed for 16 years at Teesside Crown Court, while Sam Turnbull, 36, (right) received 11 years and two months. They were both convicted of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs . Alan Crawford, 42, (left) was sentenced to nine years in prison for his involvement in the plot to move 'pure' cocaine in out of the North, while Ian McCabe, 43, (right) was sentenced to five years and four months . All three faced charges of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs after police seized three separate 1kg consignments of almost pure cocaine during the course of the operation. Detective Chief Inspector Victoria Fuller, head of Durham Police's specialist crime operations unit, said the gang had operated across the North East and North West. Almost £125,000 in cash and 24kg of Class B cannabis resin were also recovered from the gang, described as 'at, or very near, the top of the supply chain'. The cocaine's packaging and purity indicated they were 'wholesalers' selling 'virtually pure product in bulk'. The court heard how the business was directed by Lister who had links to the North West, West Yorkshire and Humberside. Gang member Gary John Kays, from Liverpool, who acted as a middle-man moving drugs between the North East and North West, was jailed for three years and five months. Police seized three separate 1kg consignments of almost pure cocaine (above) during the course of the operation and said it's packaging and purity indicated the gang were 'wholesalers' selling 'product in bulk' Police also seized almost £125,000 in cash (above) and 24kg of Class B cannabis resin from the gangs' homes . Kays was previously jailed for seven years in 2008 after helping Sean Mercer destroy evidence linking him to the murder of 11-year-old schoolboy Rhys Jones. The tragic killing made headlines when Rhys was shot in car park of a pub in August 2007. Stephen John Golding, 33, from Liverpool, was jailed for five years and six months yesterday, while Ian McCabe, 43, from County Durham, will also serve more than five years. The other members of the gang received either prison terms of two years or less, a suspended sentence or community order. One man has yet to be sentenced and will be dealt with by the court on Monday next week. Detective Chief Inspector Fuller said: 'The sentences given by the court demonstrate very clearly that those who choose a life of organised crime will be caught and dealt with. The gang members were sentenced to a total of 60 years in jail when they appeared at Teesside Crown Court . 'The men we arrested were, quite simply, horrible people who only cared for themselves. At no stage did they give a single thought to the misery their offending inflicted on communities or the innocent people caught up in their activities. 'This is not just about the damage drugs themselves may cause but the associated crime which can badly affect communities, not just in our area but others as well. 'Our aim is to keep the communities of County Durham safe, and the fact we arrested people from Merseyside, Humberside and the Greater Manchester area as well as the North East shows how this type of crime cuts across boundaries.'","Gang members jailed after huge police operation caught them with cocaine .

"An 85-year-old grandmother died after accidentally being given tablets that were three times stronger than her regular medication, an inquest has heard. Betty Gough, from Longlevens, Gloucestershire, had been taking the stronger pills for a month before she  had a fall at home, fracturing eight ribs and puncturing her lung. An inquest at Gloucestershire Coroner's Court heard that the overdose of anti-depressant pill Dosulepin could have caused her to lose her balance, and become unsteady or disoriented. Betty Gough, 85, was given a box of pills that were three times stronger than her regular does - and had been taking them for a month before she fell over suffering eight fractured ribs and a punctured lung . Lloyds Pharmacy in Longlevens admitted giving her a box of 75mg pills, but with a label printed on the front saying 25mg - her usual dosage. Mrs Gough had been taking the same medication since 1984 with no problems and had no history of falls before her accident. Patients are being urged to go pharmacies for treatment to cut visits to overburdened GP surgeries. NHS England is today launching a campaign to urge patients with minor ailments to make better use of the 11,500 high street chemists across England. A survey by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said treating patients in pharmacies could cut A&E visits by 650,000 a year, and reduce GP consultations by 18million. Sheila Reade, Mrs Gough's daughter, said: 'I noticed that my mum was not at all herself - she became confused and forgetful  - and I thought she was beginning to suffer from dementia.' After Ms Gough's death Lloyds Pharmacy sent the family a letter admitting to the blunder, saying the shop had been 'busy' that day. The company apologised for the error, adding that the pills had been handed out by a trainee, with the box checked by a supervisor. Mrs Gough's son, Sydney, told the inquest that his mother called him at 3am on April 28 to say she had fallen, hitting her side on a cabinet. He said he went to her house and put her into bed, before calling for an ambulance. She was taken to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital where she received a CT scan and an X-Ray. Doctors confirmed she had suffered eight fractured ribs, a punctured lung, and internal bleeding. Despite attempts to save her, she died on May 6. Assistant Coroner David Dooley Dooley said: 'The medication was dispensed in error and possibly contributed to her instability.' Lloyds Pharmacy in Longlevens, Gloucestershire, sent the family a letter apologising for the blunder - saying the shop had been 'busy' on the day she collected the pills . Giving a narrative verdict, Mr Dooley said: 'Mrs Betty Gough was an 85-year-old lady with no history of falls. 'On April 28, 2014 she fell against a cabinet at her house resulting in her sustaining multiple rib fractures and subsequent internal bleeding from which she deteriorated and died at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital on May 6, 2014. 'Erroneous dispensing of her regular antidepressant prescription for Dolsulepin at thee times the appropriate level was considered a possible contributory factor in recent problems with balance which first became apparent as being suffered by Mrs Gough in mid-March, 2014.' After the inquest Sydney Gough added: 'We are of course taking this matter further and are considering legal action against Lloyds Pharmacy but decided to wait for the inquest first.'","Betty Gough, 85, given box of anti-depressants with incorrect label on front .

"Magic Johnson's son underwent the gastric sleeve surgery he announced he wanted on Saturday's #RichKids of Beverly Hills season finale back in August, E! News reports. EJ Johnson, 22-year-old NYU student and self-appointed 'diva,' reportedly underwent the surgery shortly after filming the last episode of season two of the show.

Many celebrities struggling to lose weight, such as Rosie O'Donnell, have opted for gastric sleeve surgery. The Examiner reports that O'Donnell went under the knife in 2013 after numerous health scares and a heart attack caused her to worry about her weight. During the operation, about 80% of the stomach is removed, shrinking what's left of the organ to a tube the size of a banana. Johnson announced he was planning on getting the surgery on the season two finale of #RichKids of Beverly Hills. The show stars the offspring of several wealthy families in Beverly Hills. Joan Rivers had EJ Johnson as a guest on Fashion Police last year and asked him about his relationship with his father, the legendary Lakers point guard who won five national championships with the team.

"Wanted terrorist Mohamed Elomar could have appeared in an Islamic State propaganda video alongside a Sydney teenager. On Tuesday, video surfaced of Abdullah Elmir, 17, who fled Australia back in June to join the terror group in Syria, telling his mother he was going fishing. In the video posted on YouTube, Elmir - going by the name of Abu Khaled – makes threats to Australia and the rest of the Western world and also takes aim at Prime Minister Tony Abbott. Wanted terrorist Mohamed Elomar could have appeared in an Islamic State propaganda video alongside a Sydney teenager . But a day later, speculation about the identity of a man who appeared alongside the teenager mounted and The Sydney Morning Herald reported intelligence officers were now looking closely at the video to determine if the man seen standing to the right of Elmir is the notorious extremist. When asked by Daily Mail Australia if he thought the man in question was Elomar, Dr Jamal Rifi - a friend of the former boxer's family - said: 'I believe he is.' Dr Rifi also added he had not spoken with the Elomars. 'They are overseas and I have no way in contacting them,' he said. Intelligence agencies are looking to confirm if Elomar (pictured) appears in the 1.43 minute video . Fairfax Media has been told intelligence agencies were inspecting the video and chief among their concerns was the man standing closest to Elmir is the wanted terrorist who has close ties with another extremist, Khaled Sharrouf. Earlier this year, Sharrouf caused a worldwide stir when he posted photos on Twitter of his son proudly holding up a severed head in Syria. Warrants for the arrest of Elomar and Sharrouf were issued by the Australian Federal Police in July. In the recently emerged footage, Elmir is flanked by his Islamic State comrades with the well-known black and white flag and brandishing a weapon. Elomar is one of two notorious extremists the Australian Federal Police have put arrest warrants out for in July . The jihadist claimed IS were going to put a 'black flag on top of Buckingham Palace' and the White House. 'We will keep on fighting and we will fight you and defeat you,' he stated. As his hate-filled diatribe finishes he begins chanting in Arabic and the fighters around him join in. Throughout, the man believed to Elomar alternates his gaze from Elmir and in front of him. His face remains expressionless and the only time he shows any emotion is when he joins in chanting with his brothers-in-arms at the conclusion of the video. The man holds a rifle in front of his body with both hands.","A video surfaced of Sydney teenager Abdullah Elmir, 17, on Tuesday .

"An abandoned village in Connecticut, the unfulfilled vision of an 'eccentric' aerospace engineering executive, is up for auction the week of Halloween. The old twine mill town of Johnsonville, in East Haddam, hasn't allowed visitors in decades. It may again, as the 62 acres of land and assorted abandoned Victorian buildings are for sale, with bidding starting at $800,000. Scroll down for video . Keep out: An abandoned village in Connecticut, the unfulfilled vision of an 'eccentric' aerospace engineering executive, is up for auction the week of Halloween. The buildings haven't been used since Raymond Schmitt died in 1998 and have closed to curious guests . Jim Kelly of brokerage firm RM Bradley says he planned the auction to fall around Halloween to play up the more mysterious aspects of the town, as ghost stories abound and the property has an ethereal feel. Johnsonville began in the 19th century as a mill town built around an active twine mill operation on the Moodus River. In 1972, Raymond Schmitt, who Kelly describes as a 'very eccentric' owner of aerospace part corporation AGC Incorporated, bought the property after a lightning strike destroyed the mill. Chapel: Schmitt worked to find buildings, like this old chapel, to fill a 19th century tourist destination that sadly never boomed . Decay: After Schmitt's death in 1998, most of the buildings fell into disrepair, though the property changed hands and was set for development at several times . Schmitt decided to create a Victorian-era tourist attraction and traveled around the northeast buying up entire buildings and shipping them to Johnsonville. A post office, schoolhouse, chapel, general store and the original homestead of the mill owners give Johnsonville the air of a vibrant yet abandoned town. Schmitt even purchased a paddleboat from the World's Fair in the 1960s and brought it to Johnsonville, where he hoped to use it to ferry passengers around the lake in the middle of the property. But although Schmitt allowed visitors onto the grounds, and weddings were occasionally held at the Swiss chalet-styled restaurant the town never truly became a bustling hub for tourists and Schmitt died in 1998. Even the paddleboat began sinking into the lake. Homestead: Large home tracts are laid out throughout the village, which never became the destination Schmitt was quite hoping it would . Flashback: The show Abandoned shot an episode about Johnsonville, which was a quiet tourist destination starting in the 1970s, but was later abandoned . Origins: Johnsonville was originally the home of a twine mill, and pictured here in this photo posted to the town's Facebook is the original Neptune mill, which was struct by lightning in 1972 and burned . No Trespassing signs hang now warning off curious travelers, and Damned Connecticut calls the grounds 'a weird dead spot' in an otherwise populated town. The auction takes place October 28 and Kelly says visitors have viewed the auction page more than 700 times. As for bidding, Kelly says he doesn't know how high the final price will be, but that the 62 acres stand to sell for a high price. '$800,000 just gets you in the game,' he added. Tranquility: In spite of never becoming a vacationer's paradise, some report going fishing at the pond and even having their wedding on the Johnsonville before it was closed . Vintage: The old General Store gives the village a timeless feel that may or may not be preserved by the new owners .","Johnsonville, in East Haddam, was originally a twine mill town before the mill was destroyed by lightning in 1972 .

"Female celebrities whose nude naked images were hacked are threatening to sue Google for $100 million for allegedly  'making millions from the victimization of women'. Top Hollywood lawyer Marty Singer, who represents over a dozen of the women affected by the leak, has written a letter to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, accusing them of 'blatantly unethical behavior'. The letter, which also reached executive chairman Eric Schmidt and the company's lawyers, alleges that Google failed 'to act expeditiously, and responsibly to remove the images'. Kate Upton (left) and Jennifer Lawrence were two of the actresses affected by the leak. But it is unknown which women Marty Singer is representing . It compares their alleged lack of action to the NFL leadership's handling of the Ray Rice affair, Page Six reports. Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, Amber Heard, Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Cara Delevingne were among the female celebrities affected by the leak when images were hacked from iCloud accounts. But it is unknown which women Singer represents. The letter, exclusively seen by Page Six claims in knowingly accommodating, facilitating, and perpetuating the unlawful conduct, Google is making millions and profiting from the victimization of women'. Singer claims his firm Lavely & Singer sent a notice to remove images four weeks ago - and several more since - but many of the images are still on Google sites BlogSpot and YouTube. He writes: 'Google knows the images are hacked stolen property, private and confidential photos and videos unlawfully obtained and posted by pervert predators who are violating the victims' privacy rights… Yet Google has taken little or no action to stop these outrageous violations' Actress Amber Heard, fiancée of Johnny Depp, is one of the victims - with over 50 pictures surfacing . Reality star Kim Kardashian (left) and singer Rihanna (right) were hit by the celebrity hacking scandal . The letter continues: 'Because the victims are celebrities with valuable publicity rights you do nothing - nothing but collect millions of dollars in advertising revenue … as you seek to capitalize on this scandal rather than quash it.' Singer then compares Google's behavior to the NFL's handling of the 'Ray Rice affair' - an incident in which a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City elevator . 'Like the NFL, which turned a blind eye while its players assaulted and victimized women and children, Google has turned a blind eye while its sites repeatedly exploit and victimize these women,' it says.

"School and law enforcement officials in New England say they are dealing with an unusually high number of bomb threats that have forced the cancellation of classes just weeks into the new academic year. Nearly a dozen schools and colleges in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut have received the threats, forcing evacuations and cancellations in many of the schools this past week. Local school and law enforcement officials say they aren't sure if they're dealing with a coordinated effort or a number of copycats. But the sheer number of threats in such a short amount of time is concerning, they say. Ross A. Lurgio Middle School (pictured) in Bedford, New Hampshire, was one of the schools evacuated last week . 'Something unusual is taking place here,' said Thomas Scott, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents. 'To have it at the very beginning of the school year and to have this many is an anomaly.' He said school districts tend to see bomb threats throughout the school year, including around exam time in June. The communities of Bedford, Mass. and Bedford, New Hampshire were both forced to cancel classes at their high schools when they received threats on Oct. 1. Sandy Hook Elementary School's temporary home in Monroe, Connecticut, was also evacuated that day after receiving a bomb threat by phone, putting a community still reeling from the December 2012 massacre that killed 26 children and teachers on edge. And campus police at Harvard University tightened security over the weekend after hundreds of students and people affiliated with the Ivy League school received an email threatening a mass shooting on campus. Sandy Hook Elementary School - relocated to the former Chaulk Hill School building in Monroe, Conn (pictured) - also had a bomb threat last week . The latest threats came Monday when school officials in the affluent Boston suburb of Winchester cancelled high school classes after receiving an emailed threat and the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts was temporarily evacuated when police received a 911 call claiming there were multiple bombs on the western Massachusetts campus. Many of the threats remain under investigation. The FBI's Boston office said Monday it is aware of the bomb threats and is offering assistance as needed but leaving local officials to take the lead in the investigations. Scott says the bomb threats are causing significant disruptions early in the school year, taking away from valuable class time, causing scheduling headaches for working parents and forcing schools to expend limited resources to cover staff and administrative costs. In New Hampshire, Bedford Police Chief John Bryfonski said responding to the threats, many of which had been unfounded, hinders local department's ability to handle other emergencies.  'Thankfully, we do not receive many threats in Bedford, but we do treat each one as a serious matter that demonstrates we will vigorously investigate these cases and prosecute those responsible,' he said. In Winchester, Christian Nixon, a parent and school committee chairman, says he appreciates the district's 'quick and decisive action' to cancel classes and the 'thoroughness' of emergency responders. 'Regardless of any perceived pattern, our primary focus as a district is on the safety, security, and welfare of our students, teachers, and staff,' he said. John Guilfoil, who handles public relations for some of the Massachusetts police departments that have dealt with the bomb threats, expects departments in the coming weeks will be reminding officers to continue to treat each incident seriously. 'No one is going to fault a police department for deciding to cancel school because of a threat,' he said. 'It's much, much more responsible to do something out of an abundance of caution than to put young people in harm's way.'","Nearly a dozen schools and colleges in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut have received threats the past week .

"A study has claimed that religious Jewish teens exhibit less suicide-risk behaviour than their secular Jewish peers. The research suggests that observing Judaism helps to protect adolescents against suicide - despite still being depressed. The conclusion was drawn by surveying hundreds of adolescents and their mothers in Israel. A study led by Tel Aviv University has claimed that adolescents who practice Judaism (stock image shown) are less likely to commit suicide than their secular peers. They claim that religious Jewish teens exhibit 45 per cent less suicide-risk behaviour than non-religious teens . The study by the Israeli Health Ministry was published in the journal European Psychiatry. Home interviews of 620 Jewish adolescents aged 14 to 17 and their mothers were carried out in the survey. It assessed sociodemographic characteristics and mental health, including suicidal thoughts and behaviours. Participants were asked to define their degree of religiosity as 'secular,' 'observant,' or 'ultra-Orthodox,' the three main categories of Judaism in Israel. Researchers from the University of Vienna have found a correlation between sunshine hours and suicide rates. They discovered that suicides increased when a day was particularly sunny. However if the preceding 14 to 60 days were sunny the rate dropped. The former was more noticeable in females, and the latter in males. While a cause is not known sunlight is thought to alter levels of serotonin, which is known to affect peoples' moods. And the results showed that religious Jewish teenagers exhibit 45 per cent less suicide-risk behavior, including attempted suicide, than their secular Jewish peers. The researchers say this suggests that religious observance helps protect Jewish adolescents against suicide. 'Death by suicide is one of the most common causes of death in the adolescent population, and it is potentially preventable,' said one of the study's authors Dr Ben Amit from Tel Aviv University's Sackler School of Medicine . 'This has led us, like many other researchers, to try to better understand the reasons leading to adolescent suicide - to reduce its occurrence.' He added: 'Recognising the risk factors and mechanisms associated with self-harm and suicide is important in the prevention of adolescent suicide. 'As this is the first study demonstrating a protective effect for religiosity against suicide in Jewish adolescents, we believe it may provide valuable insight for both clinicians and policymakers dealing with Jewish adolescents, in Israel and worldwide.' In the research 620 Jewish teens were asked to define their degree of religiosity as 'secular,' 'observant,' or 'ultra-Orthodox'. And it was found that those who weren't secular had less suicidal thoughts (stock image shown), despite still being depressed . In the US suicide ranks behind only accidents and murder as a leading killer of 15-to-24 year-olds, according to the National Institute for Mental Health. Israel's suicide rate, on the other hand, is among the lowest in the developed world. 'For many of these teens, suicide is simply about losing hope,' said co-author Dr Gal Shoval, also of Tel Aviv University. 'We know from working with suicide survivors that even when they were 99 percent sure they were going to kill themselves, they still sought hope. 'Jewish faith and community may be their most important source of hope.' Dr Amit added: 'Using statistical tools, we demonstrated that the protective effect of the practice of Judaism was not associated with a decreased risk of depression. Instead, it enhanced effective coping mechanisms. 'This stands in direct contrast to studies of religious Christian teenagers who reported feeling less depressed than their secular peers.'","A study led by Tel Aviv University has claimed that adolescents who practice Judaism are less likely to commit suicide than their secular peers .

"A pediatric nurse accused of molesting a six-week-old boy who was born prematurely allegedly sent indecent photos of the baby to a counselor. Michael William Lutts, who is also a foster parent, brought the infant to his home on August 4 and texted Stephen Schaffner, saying 'Hey I have a baby for us', court documents show. Lutts, a nurse at Kaiser Permanente care group, sent several images and videos of a sexual messages to Schaffner, a counselor from Greensboro, Maryland. Pediatric nurse Michael William Lutts (right), 50, allegedly molested a baby and sent pictures to counselor Stephen Schaffner (left), 34 . Schaffner, who was charged yesterday with conspiracy and nine counts of sexual exploitation of a child, replied with messages including, 'That's hot' and 'nice pic'. Lutts sent the images and messages to Schaffner, 34, immediately after being granted care of the baby and the two made plans for the nurse to abuse the child, according to federal prosecutors. Lutts, 50, was arrested in August and is charged with sexual molestation. Court documents read: 'It was the object of the scheme to employ and use [the infant] to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual depictions of such conduct.' Schaffner was a licensed clinical counselor in Maryland until his permit was suspended in June, prosecutors said. He had previously worked as a counselor in Arizona, Fox 5 reported. He will face between 15 and 30 years in prison for each count, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Prosecutors said arrests were made following an investigation of an email address of someone who was allegedly distributing child pornography. Lutts was identified as a recipient. FBI agents later searched Lutts’ home and found a cell phone that allegedly included the text messages, photographs and videos.

"A plasterer stabbed his identical twin to death in their parents' kitchen on New Year's Eve before fleeing barefoot and partying with friends until 2am. Robert Cerqua was found guilty today of murdering his brother Christopher after the drunk 31-year-olds began arguing about the past at the family home in Hythe, Hampshire. As the tussle escalated, their parents called 999 and pleaded with police to break up the fight, before the operator heard their father cry: 'He's stabbed him'. Guilty: Robert Cerqua (left) murdered his twin brother Christopher (right) with a kitchen knife in a New Year's Eve argument, then fled their parents' home barefoot and went to a party until 2.20am with his girlfriend . Force: When police found the knife in the kitchen sink its handle had been broken, the court heard . Robert Cerqua insisted he acted only in self-defence, but the jury of nine men and three women took 16 hours to find him guilty of murder. He showed no emotion in the dock at Winchester Crown Court, where the verdict was met with a cry from the public gallery. His murder trial heard an 'extremely drunk' Cerqua left barefoot after stabbing his brother with a kitchen knife, leaving a seven-inch wound in his stomach. He joined his girlfriend at a New Year's Eve party and turned off his phone so he could not be reached, while his father Peter was left trying to stem Christopher's bleeding with a tea towel. The professional carpenter had a cardiac arrest less than an hour later and was declared dead in hospital. Police found Robert at a party in nearby Totton at 2.20am and told him what he was being arrested for - to which he replied: 'Murder?' Distressing: The twins' parents Denise and Peter, pictured outside court, called 999 for help . He then fell asleep in the back of a police car on the way to Southampton Central Police station, the court heard. When he woke up, he said: 'Is he dead? You are lying, he cannot be'. While being taken to his cell, he added: 'Was it me? Was it me? I cannot remember. Honestly, is my brother dead?' And when he was told the charge against him the next day, he allegedly said: 'I killed my f****** brother. I don’t want to be here any more. 'Nine times out of ten it would be all right. [That’s] just my luck, he had to die on me.' Prosecutor Nicholas Haggan QC said the brothers had spent a 'happy and relaxed' evening drinking at their parents’ terraced house from 6pm on December 31 last year. Robert sent a string of texts to his girlfriend, Joelle Mansfield, which revealed how the mood deteriorated. An earlier message from Cerqua read: 'I cannot wait to marry you!!! xxx', followed at 6.30pm by: 'Yes sexy. Chris wishes happy ‘New Year! xxx'. But at 7pm he wrote: 'Me and Chris are going at it. Talking about past. We got things to sort out but all good. Enjoy your night my lovely, I love you'. At 8:10pm he added: 'There might be a fight in a minute. This is my life!! Don’t want this but what can I do. Had enough. Sorry but this is what I have got to put up with and I hate it. This is my life. Sorry, but blokes. Want to f*** off anywhere but here'. Mr Haggan told the jury of nine men and three women: 'This is a tragic case. In a nutshell, it was New Year’s Eve last year and both brothers had been drinking. 'Shortly before 9pm an argument started between the two brothers and that argument appears to have turned into a tussle. Punches may have been exchanged. 'At some point, this defendant picked up a kitchen knife and he used it to stab his brother. 'The defendant inflicted just one wound, but the tract of that wound was quite long, about 15 - 17 centimetres or approximately six or seven inches, and it punctured the aorta, the principle artery which runs down a person’s trunk. Guilty: Robert  (left) had denied killing Christopher (right) deliberately, insisting he was acting in self-defence . Murder scene: The fatal argument broke out at the twins' parents' house in Hythe, Hampshire (pictured) Argument: The row escalated and Christopher was left bleeding to death on the floor of the kitchen (pictured) 'That injury caused major internal bleeding and Christopher’s subsequent collapse.' A post mortem showed Christopher had 230 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, around three times the drink drive limit. Traces of cannabis and antidepressants were also found. His face was bruised from a punch and where he fell to the ground. Robert told police he had drunk six cans of lager and two glasses of red wine before leaving the house. In interviews, Robert Cerqua said his brother had been threatening him with the knife and he had either taken it, or picked up another, in a bid to defend himself. The kitchen knife said to have been used - its handle broken and the blade bent - was discovered in the kitchen sink. DNA found on the knife matched both the defendant and his brother because, as identical twins, they shared the same DNA profile. Argument: The pair chatted in a friendly way at this table but the talk became heated as the night wore on . Difficult: The pair's parents Peter and Denise (pictured) watched many of the hearings from the public gallery . In his first police interview on New Year's Day, Robert described his relationship with Christopher as 'fiery' and said drink could make him 'nasty' and 'short-tempered'. He added: 'We started arguing, I do not know about what... All I can remember is he picked a knife up and walked towards me and I sort of panicked. 'I do not remember much. I punched him - I had a knife in my hand. He yelped and I ran out of the door.' In a later interview he said he had not intended to kill his brother but had 'just reacted'. Christopher Cerqua was described in tributes as 'thoughtful and caring', and had recently got back together with girlfriend Lisa Harfield, 40, a receptionist. The couple had previously dated for six years and her son and three daughters described him as a ‘father figure’. Sentencing is due to take place at Winchester Crown Court tomorrow.","Robert and Christopher Cerqua were at parents' home in Hythe, Hampshire .

"Police missed opportunities to intervene in the months leading up to a controlling husband shooting dead his estranged wife, an independent watchdog has found. Christopher Parry shot his wife Caroline twice in the back and then turned the gun on himself in a botched suicide attempt, in Newport, South Wales. A court heard she had decided to end their marriage after being fed up of his controlling and domineering ways. Parry's trial at Newport Crown Court heard in the weeks leading up to the tragedy, Mrs Parry had contacted police three times over fears about her husband's behaviour. Christopher Parry shot his wife Caroline twice in the back and then turned the gun on himself in a botched suicide attempt, in Newport, South Wales.  Now a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Gwent Police needed to make improvements to the way it handled stalking and harassment cases . Now a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Gwent Police needed to make improvements to the way it handled stalking and harassment cases. It made four main findings - saying officers responding to incidents involving the couple did not have 'all the relevant information' about their past history. It also said police should have given greater consideration to Parry's coercive behaviour and carried out more checks on his firearms license. IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: 'This was a callous, brutal murder that devastated Caroline's family and friends. 'Our investigation found weaknesses and shortcomings in how Gwent Police handled this case and it is not the first time the IPCC has raised concerns over how the force responds to domestic abuse cases. 'The force has given a higher priority to domestic abuse cases, but I am urging senior officers again to ensure they take all necessary steps to improve their performance. The shooting took place on August 8, 2013. Mrs Parry had been living in the city after moving out of the home she shared with her husband six miles away in Croesyceiliog, near Cwmbran. But despite being told on April 12 their relationship was over, Parry refused to accept his marriage had ended and was 'convinced' she still had feelings for him. He kept his wife under surveillance and was described as a man 'not prepared to let go'. In the weeks leading up to tragedy, he repeatedly texted, phoned and even followed his wife. On the day in question, Mrs Parry was leaving for work when something suddenly caused her to stop and open the boot of her red Toyota. It was then her estranged husband got out of his Ford Focus and pulled the trigger three times. Neighbours later found the couple's bloodied bodies lying side by side on the road. Mrs Parry was pronounced dead at the Royal Gwent Hospital. Parry, who put the shotgun under his jaw, survived - but with substantial injuries. The IPCC said its report looked at how Gwent Police had dealt with three incidents in the run up to the murder. It highlighted that officers had failed to make referrals to the Firearms Licensing Department, which might have led to Christopher Parry's firearms licence being withdrawn before the fatal shooting. Pictured here is the scene after the shootings.  A report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said Gwent Police needed to make improvements to the way it handled stalking and harassment cases . The IPCC's investigation concluded one officer had a case to answer for misconduct. Gwent Police said they had 'already dealt with the matter' It also said a risk assessment should have classified Caroline Parry as being 'at high risk of serious harm' and more consideration 'should have been given to Christopher Parry's coercive and controlling behaviour'. Another problem the IPCC found was the way in which it had a ratings system called 'firearms warning markers'. The watchdog said: 'Markers only appeared on incident logs if the report was made from the address to which the firearms certificate was registered. 'Victims of domestic abuse who are estranged from their partners will invariably live at a different address, and so may not benefit from the degree of protection given by such markers which are important in alerting officers to a potential risk.' The IPCC's investigation concluded one officer had a case to answer for misconduct. Gwent Police said they had 'already dealt with the matter'. Parry was handed a life sentence with a minimum of 26 years. When eventually eligible for parole in 2040, he will be 76-years-old. Sentencing judge Mr Justice Wyn Williams told Parry: 'By your actions you have deprived your wife of her life, your daughter and son of their mother, and brought grief and unhappiness to very many people, and your own life is in ruins.'","Christopher Parry shot his wife Caroline twice in the back after she left him .

"A man serving 26 years for a murder he claims he did not commit could possibly be set free if one high-profile attorney has her way. Mario Casciaro, of Johnsburg, Illinois, was convicted last year in the 2002 killing of Brian Carrick, even though a body was never found and the prosecution admitted he never laid a finger on his victim. Now, lawyer Kathleen Zellner thinks she has evidence that won't only set Casciaro free, but also reveal who killed Carrick. Scroll down for video . Mario Casciaro is serving 26 years in prison for the murder of Brian Carrick . Carrick (left) was last seen on December 20, 2002, and in 2010 Casciaro (right) was charged with his death . She revealed her new findings last night on an episode of 20/20. Casciaro and Carrick were both employees at Val's Grocery, the last place Carrick was ever seen alive on December 20, 2002. His blood was found in the produce cooler at the grocery store, but no one was ever arrested or charged with his murder or disappearance. Then, a story began to circulate that Casciaro was dealing drugs, and had Carrick working for him. People started to say he had the boy killed over a debt of $400 to $500, including Carrick's father. At this point the FBI was also investigating the death, but found no truth to any of these rumors. Everything changed however in 2010, when Shane Lamb, who also worked with the boys at Val's, was arrested on cocaine charges. He told prosecutor Michael Combs that Carrick did owe Casciaro money and he was called in to 'take care of him.' Lamb says he punched the 17-year-old Carrick and knocked him out, killing him. Casciaro then said he would take care of the body. New evidence suggest that Casciaro might be set free . And so Casciaro was charged with first-degree murder with intimidation, while Lamb received no charges as part of his plea bargain and a reduced sentence for his cocaine charge. Lamb is now saying he lied and was coerced by Combs. 'I was following what [Combs] wanted me to say. They just wanted to close the case,' Lamb said. He also claimed that Combs was determined to charge one of the two boys with murder. 'I was like, ""If you, you know, you brought me into this. My family doesn’t have money to pay for a lawyer. They don’t have money to bond me out like yours does.""' Lamb said he told Casciaro. “ . 'You know, I’m like, ""They were trying to indict me for murder,"" and I’m like, ""I didn’t have money to fight this case.""' Lamb, however, is not who Zellner thinks killed Carrick, but rather another young man working at the store with the boys - Rob Render. Render's fingerprint was found in Carrick's blood splatter and one store employee, Jacob Kepple, says he saw the two boys fighting over drug money on the night he died. 'Brian had told Rob, ""If you don't have it by Friday, it's 60,”' Kepple recalled. 'And to me, that meant, ""If you don't have the $30 you owe me for weed by Friday, then it's double.”' Old video shows Shane Lamb speaking with prosecutor Michael Combs . lamb now says he lied on the stand, and that Combs coerced him . Render was also missing for almost two hours that night, between 5 pm and 7 pm, which is when Carrick disappeared. And there's more. An employee later found underwear soiled with blood hidden in the ceiling of one of the store's bathrooms, underwear that was never tested for DNA or admitted as evidence in the trial. Zellner is convinced that DNA will prove Render was the killer. Render did not testify in the first trial, and died of a heroin overdose before Casciaro's second trial. His first trial ended in a hung jury. 'The only person that really dislikes Brian Carrick is Render. The only person … that owes money to Brian Carrick is Render,' Zellner said. 'The only person who's ever described wanting to jump him with a weapon is Render, and the only person in that back hallway is Render.'","Mario Casciaro was arrested in 2010 for the 2002 murder of Brian Carrick, and charged with first degree murder by intimidation .

Lamb has now said he lied at the urging of prosecutors about what happened .
Furthermore, the fingerprint of another man, Rob Render, was found in Carrick's blood splatter ."
"Two of the biggest beer makers in the world have posted details of what goes into Budweiser and Miller Lite after pressure from a food blogger. Anheuser-Busch and MillerCoors detailed the ingredients of some of their most popular brands on Thursday, and promised to be more transparent in the future. The announcements come a day after blogger Vani Hari posted a petition on FoodBabe.com to get major brewers to list what goes in their beverages. Info on tap: Food blogger Vani Hari managed to get two major breweries to disclose their ingredients . Because the Treasury department rather than the Food and Drug Administration oversees alcoholic beverages, no law exists to force brewers to list the ingredients they use. Since Hari highlighted the discrepancy, Anheuser-Busch listed ingredients for . its two top-selling brands on its website, tapintoyourbeer.com. It . lists the same ingredients for Budweiser and Bud Light: water, barley . malt, rice, yeast and hops. The company, which also makes Beck's, Busch . and Michelob beers, said it will list the ingredients for all of its . other brands online 'in the coming days'. Thursday's disclosure was the first time . Anheuser-Busch had detailed the ingredients of its beers. MillerCoors posted the ingredients of Miller Lite, Coors Light and six other brands on its Facebook page. Most are made from water, barley malt, corn, yeast and hops, the company said. 'We also value transparency and are happy to comply with the request for additional information,' MillerCoors said in a statement. The company says that consumers can call to ask what ingredients are in their beer, and it will also put more information online 'in the days ahead'. Its other brands in the U.S. include Peroni and Redd's Apple Ale. Both companies said that they are not required to list ingredients, but are doing so voluntarily because customers want it. Hops to it: The makers of Budweiser listed what goes into its drinks after an online campaign . An online petition, started Wednesday by Hari, has more than 44,000 signatures. Hari has become a powerful voice in the food industry. She is the same blogger who successfully pushed sandwich chain Subway to remove an ingredient in its bread that is also used in yoga mats. She chose to petition beer makers because her husband drinks beer, and she wants to be able to see what she is buying. Representatives from Anheuser-Busch invited Hari and her family to visit its brewery in St Louis to see how its beers are made. Hari said she is working with the company to schedule a visit.","Budweiser and Miller Lite agree to reveal what goes in popular drinks .

"Sam Ayodele Ogunnoiki, from St Austell, Cornwall, came back from a three week trip to find his employer Stout Security LTD told him he could not work for a three week incubation period . A security guard was shocked after returning from a holiday to visit his mother in Nigeria to find he had been banned from work because his employers feared he had Ebola. Sam Ayodele Ogunnoiki, 46, from St Austell, Cornwall came back from a three week holiday there on Saturday to find a letter from his boss saying several members of staff had raised concerns about working with him following his trip. That came despite Nigeria being officially declared free of the deadly virus. Mr Ogunnoiki, who has worked for Stout Security LTD for eight years, was told by director Trevor Mannell that he had to allay colleagues' fears that he was carrying the Ebola virus back with him and could not allow him to return to work until he had been back in the UK for at least three weeks. The letter told Mr Ogunnoiki: 'You have been in my employ for several years and I have always done my very best to look after you, frequently helping you out when you called on me for assistance. 'With our friendship in mind, I have spoken to you and expressed my very deep concerns about your trip to Nigeria. 'Several members of staff have now voiced their concerns about the possibility of your carrying the Ebola virus back with you and have made it very clear that they are extremely reluctant to work with you on your return. 'One member of staff has even written a clear and concise letter stating the concerns of your work colleagues. 'In this case I have to support their concerns - especially as I have already voiced them personally to you. 'In order to allay any fears that you are a carrier for this deadly virus, I feel I cannot allow you to return to work until you have been back in the United Kingdom for three weeks - which is the incubation period. 'I must also request that you visit your doctor on your return and get a clean bill of health before you can start work with us. 'I am very sorry about this Sam but everyone works in close proximity together and I have to put the concerns of the majority first.' Nigeria was declared disease-free on October 20 after a 42 day waiting period following a small outbreak of twenty cases of Ebola, which saw eight deaths. Mr Ogunnoiki was told to stay away from his zero hours contract job with Stout Security in Pendennis Dockyard . Director Trevor Mannell of Stout Security LTD (whose HQ in St Austell, Cornwall, is the mustard coloured building on left) wrote to Mr Ogunnoiki supporting 'concerns' of his colleagues Mr Ogunnoiki might have Ebola . On Monday Mr Ogunnoiki, who works as a security officer at Pendennis Dockyard in Falmouth was told by Mr Mannell that the company had sent him an email stating they did not want him or anyone who had been in contact with Mr Ogunnoiki since his return from the country working at the site. Ironically the Government has tried to reassure locals in Falmouth over the imminent arrival of a ship in Falmouth Docks from Ebola hit Sierra Leone. Mr Ogunnoiki described his employers' dramatic move as unbelievable and said he had been tested in Nigeria for the disease before leaving the country which had come back negative. He said his wife who is employed by the same company had been allowed to work despite having been in contact with him since he returned back from Nigeria, which made no sense. The letter Stout Security LTD had written to Mr Ogunnoiki telling him to avoid his workplace for three weeks . 'It's just discrimination,' said Mr Ogunnoiki. 'I have worked at Stout since moving to Cornwall in 2006 when I married my wife, who is English. 'I went to the Port Health Authority and they told me there was no problem with visiting my mother in Nigeria so I went and came back on Saturday. 'I then got the letter and a text from Mr Mannell saying he couldn't allow me to return to work in case I had Ebola. 'I was scanned for Ebola in Nigeria and everything came back fine. 'But my boss told me I must be in quarantine for 21 days and cannot come to work. Mr Ogunnoiki received a text message from Stout Security LTD saying it was 'a problem' he travelled to Nigeria . 'Nigeria does not have Ebola but he said I have to be cleared. There is this stigma surrounding me now. It's just ignorance and a nightmare because I cannot work. I'm a British citizen. 'My wife does the same job as me and I saw her at the weekend and she has been allowed to work, but if she has been in contact with me she would have Ebola too. 'There is no justification for this at all.' Mr Ogunnoiki added that it was unlikely Stout Security LTD would rehire him to work again at Pendennis Dockyard in Falmouth. He said he has now been put on a zero hours contract. 'I doubt I'll get any more work at the security firm. 'It's a problem. I don't know what I'm going to do for work now. 'I don't want to go on benefits. But I doubt I'll get any more work at the security firm. It's a problem.' A medical professional takes part in an eight-hour national Ebola breakout exercise in October to test Britain's readiness for an outbreak, but Nigeria, to where Mr Ogunnoiki travelled, has been declared free of the virus . A spokesman from Falmouth and Truro Port Health Authority confirmed that no restrictions had been placed on Mr Ogunnoiki as Nigeria had been declared Ebola free last month. They said: 'A gentleman who has just returned from Nigeria contacted us with an inquiry and asked if we are imposing any requirements on him. 'We said Nigeria is free of Ebola, so the answer is no.' But defending his decision to ban Mr Ogunnoiki from working, Mr Mannell said: 'I did send Sam a letter saying anyone returning from any African countries for safety reasons cannot work for three weeks afterwards. 'I know Nigeria is Ebola free but I don't know where he's travelled. Staff load component of an Ebola treatment centre on to an aid plane bound for Sierra Leone where the deadly virus is killing thousands, but Mr Ogunnoiki had not travelled there but 1,800 miles away in Nigeria (file photo) 'My problem is that Pendennis shipyard, which I have a contract with, sent me an email saying they cannot have anyone working there that's been in contact with Sam. 'It's causing me a problem because I have got so much work down there and I need Sam to work.' Mr Mannell also confirmed that Mr Ogunnoiki's wife had been allowed to work - but said he did not know if she would be able to now. He added: 'I have to be so careful with this and securing my work at Pendennis as they said they did not want him working or anyone else who's been in contact. 'I am taking legal advice and have told Sam to do the same.' A spokesman from Pendennis Shipyard denied sending an email to Mr Mannell telling him that Mr Ogunnoiki and anyone who had worked with him from Stout Security could not work at the site.","Sam Ayodele Ogunnoiki came back to find his colleagues were 'concerned'

"The family of a 'brainwashed' British teenager who loved the X Factor and KFC today demanded to know why airport officials allowed her to fly on a school day when she  fled to Syria to join ISIS. Yusra Hussein, 15, left home in September but instead of going to class went to Heathrow where she caught a flight to Turkey. She boarded a plane with a 17-year-old British girl she met online and the two are now believed to be in Syria, and may have married jihadist fighters. Speaking today her family called on the young girl to return home - and asked why she was allowed to fly. Scroll down for video . Appeal: Sucdi Ali, left, the aunt of  Yusra Hussein, 15, right, has asked how she was able to flee Britain for Syria . Sucdi Ali, Yusra's aunt, said on ITV's This Morning: 'How did she manage to proceed through an airport on a school day, on a school hour? 'She should be in lessons, rather than just getting on a flight and going to Turkey like she is going on holiday. 'Yusra, if you are watching this, we love you we miss you and your mum and dad needs you back home no matter what. 'Just come home to us. Just remember we love you and miss you.' Yusra went missing in September and it is believed she fled to Syria to join Isis after she became radicalised online. Ms Ali said: 'She is a typical teenager who watches the X Factor and loves KFC. But in September she just disappeared. 'The night before she he told her mum she was going on a school trip and said to tell dad not to pick her up and not to make her a packed lunch. 'She went to bed early at 8pm and woke up early morning, left on a coach at Bristol from 7am . 'She never said anything about going away. She was afraid of everything, would not go out in the dark and her father would pick her up from school, which is a ten minute walk from her home. Nothing to say that she is unhappy, or that she was angry about Syria or Gaza'. Worried: Ms Sucdi and family spokesperson Anira Khokar fear the British teenager has been 'brainwashed' Hunt: Police leave Yusra's home in Bristol, where she fled telling her parents she was off on a school trip . Since the girl from Stapleton, Bristol, has been missing, she has been in touch with friends on social media but has failed to contact her family. She has said she is angry that her family are making public appeals for her to return. Yusra was able to meet another Somali schoolgirl Samya Dirie, 17, at Heathrow and board an aircraft to the Turkish capital Istanbul with her at midday. The two teenagers are not thought to have met before and only knew each other from chatting online. Police failed to stop a schoolgirl feared to be travelling to Syria from boarding a flight despite being told she had run away with her passport. Three hours after Samya Dirie’s panicked parents alerted officers that she was missing, she was allowed to fly from Heathrow to Turkey with another teenage suspected would-be jihadist. The two girls are believed to have met online and arranged to travel together to Syria, apparently intending to join Islamic State militants. Samya, 17, appeared to be a dedicated A-Level student who loved her life in Britain and dreamed of becoming a lawyer, her distraught family said yesterday (Tue). She has not contacted her parents since disappearing, but has told a cousin she is ‘somewhere far away’ and fears what the police will do to her if she returns to the UK.","Yusra Hussien, 15, may have become a 'jihadi bride' after travelling to Syria .

Question marks have been raised about the Gloucester winger's ability to score on the international stage but he answered those with aplomb just four minutes into the encounter at Twickenham. The 24-year-old received the ball 30 yards from the tryline but he completely burned Israel Dagg for pace on the outside before brilliantly finishing in the corner. No-one has ever doubted his pace and ability but there had been concerns about whether or not he had the mental capacity to be a Test finisher. Saturday's try will have given May plenty of confidence and ensures the tricky runner will be given more time to develop into an international-standard wing. Jonny May scores a sensational solo try for England after three minutes at Twickenham . May celebrates after his superb try against the All Blacks that saw England take an early lead . May and Danny Care celebrate the opening try of the match between England and New Zealand . 2) England's semi-reserve side can push the All Blacks all the way . Lancaster's side had been ravaged by injuries this autumn and it was a semi-reserve XV who took to the field at HQ on Saturday. Despite that, England came extremely close to beating the All Blacks and were certainly the better side in the first half. Once George Kruis replaced the injured Courtney Lawes, England had their fifth and sixth-choice second rows from last season on the pitch - and neither looked out of place. Dave Attwood was magnificent and Kruis also showed he has a lot to offer this side. With the likes of Joe Lauchbury, Manu Tuilagi, Marland Yarde, Alex Corbisiero, Tom Croft, Mako Vunipola, Dan Cole and Tom Youngs to return - not to mention the possible integration of rugby league convert Sam Burgess in the future - then England have an extremely competitive squad which runs deep with talent. You need a squad to win a World Cup, and England most certainly have more than 30 players worthy of being in the side next year. England had lots of injuries heading into the game yet they still matches the New Zealanders toe-for-toe . Stuart Lancaster's squad has plenty of strength  with George Kruis (right) coming on in the second row . 3) Chris Robshaw again proved he is certainly worth his place in the side . He has so many critics but the England captain was magnificent in defeat once more. The Harlequins flanker got through an astonishing amount of work and was certainly not out-shone by opposite number McCaw. Yes, Robshaw is not your archetypal 'openside' but he does a tremendous and tireless job for England at No 7. With Tom Wood doing the dirty work and Billy Vunipola the bulk of the carrying, England's back three complement each other extremely well and should retain their places against South Africa next week. England captain Chris Robshaw proved again that he is a class operator and deserves his place . Robshaw (centre) led from the front and got through a tremendous amount of work for his side . 4) Lancaster's men need to be more clinical when they are on top . What will frustrate Lancaster and his coaches - as well as the players - more than anything else was that England did not take their opportunities when they were presented with them. England were tremendous in the first half, particularly in the opening 20 minutes, but they only came away with one try to show for it. New Zealand did not make that mistake and, most notably, Robshaw and his troops can look to their opponent's third try as something to learn from. The All Blacks worked through 22 phases before replacement prop Faumuina bundled over the line. That is the art of clinical finishing - keep the ball alive and make sure you take your chances. This is something England need to rectify during the Six Nations to build confidence leading up to the World Cup. New Zealand were clinical, like for Charlie Faumuina's (centre) try, and England must learn from this . A spell of pressure for New Zealand saw Richie McCaw gather the ball and drive over the line at Twickenham . 5) The Red Rose's scrum can be a potent weapon going forward . In the last 10 minutes England utterly destroyed New Zealand at the set piece. The replacement front row of Rob Webber, Matt Mullan and young Newcastle Falcons prop Kieran Brookes - who was playing on the opposite side to where he has been deployed all season - bullied the All Blacks in the scrum. A penalty try eventually ensued, albeit too late for England to win the match, such was their dominance in this area. With so many front rowers missing through injury, including the destructive Corbisiero, Lancaster and scrummaging coach Graham Rowntree can continue to hone England's scrum and ensure it will be a useful weapon next autumn. England were dominant in the scrum and won penalties even when their reserves came on . Going forward England scrum coach Graham Rowntree will be pleased with the scrum's success .","England lost 24-21 to New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday .

"First home buyer activity has hit a new low with recent research showing August recorded the lowest levels in 15 years. There were 6,054 first home buyers committed to housing finance over the month, according to RP Data research which used housing finance data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. This is the lowest month reading since June 2000, outside of the seasonally low months of January and February. The dramatic decline since then was caused by rising property prices, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, and the changes made to the availability of First Home Buyer grants. Scroll down for video . Recent RP Data research shows 6,054 first home buyers were committed to housing finance in August - the lowest since June 2000 . Lavish properties like this Mediterranean-style home in Sydney's most expensive street in Point Piper - in the eastern suburb - seem well out of reach for first home buyers . The palatial home, which boasts 270 degree views of Sydney Habour, is on Wolseley Road and sold for more than $37 million earlier in the month . The price set a nationwide record for a non waterfront home and was the highest priced sale recorded so far in 2014 . RP Data research director Tim Lawless found the ABS housing finance data underlined a severe lack of first home buyer participation in the market. He says that the broad slowdown in first home buyer demand can probably be attributed to a few factors. 'With dwelling values rising at a time when average wages aren't rising anywhere near the same pace, affordability constraints are dampening first home buyer demand,' he said. 'This is particularly the case in Sydney and Melbourne where dwelling values have risen substantially.' Mr Lawless adds that The First Home Buyer Grant has had a huge impact on the market over the years. He says the grant boost of $14,000 in 2009 increased the number of active first timers in the housing market, reaching a record high of 18,744 in May. 'When the ""boost"" to the First Home Buyers Grant was scaled back in October 2009 and then removed in January 2010 we saw first home buyer numbers virtually fall off a cliff,' Mr Lawless said. This trend has followed suit over the years with changes to either stamp duty concessions or eligibility to first home buyer grants. A director of the research says affordability constraints are dampening first home buyer demand and changes to the availability of First Home Buyer grants also caused the record low . Mr Lawless says more first time buyers are purchasing investment properties, which doesn't include them in the Bureau of Statistics first home buyer figures. RP Data Research director Tim Lawless . 'Where a first home buyer isn't eligible for a grant or concession they may simply be flying under the radar and not being counted,' Mr Lawless said. 'For many first home buyers, the areas where they would like to live are simply too expensive for them to buy into, so they purchase an investment property while renting in an area closer to where they work and play.' The states and territories showing the most severe first home buyer trends are NSW, Victoria, Queensland and the ACT. While stronger first home buyer trends and conditions were recorded in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. However that trend has remained stagnant since mid-2013 in South Australia and Western Australia but has remained quite active in Tasmania, Mr Lawless says is reportedly the most affordable state for housing.","Recent RP Data research shows 6,054 first home buyers were committed to housing finance in August .

"Making a dinner reservation over the phone often takes longer than it should. After being put on hold one too many times, a former Facebook manager decided to take matters into his own hands. California-based Dave Morin, the founder of the social network Path, has revealed the service now allows anyone to text businesses to make complaints or handle reservations. To use Places, you first need to have the Path Talk app. The latest version will have a Places tab from which users can select nearby locations or businesses into a search field. Once a company is selected, the user can then type in a question, such as 'can I make a dinner reservation tomorrow?' The free service, named Places, is the first standalone product from Morin's 'Path' social networking business.

In most cases, this is done within 10 minutes . A new app is now making it possible for people to sell experiences that have long been priceless: a top place in line, a prime spot at a busy beach, or a dinner reservation at a five-star restaurant. Shout allows individuals to request or offer up any desirable 'spot' - physical or virtual - for a price, and the app has already been used to sell tickets to musicals, movies, operas the Tribeca Film Festival -- and even to pass off Cronuts for $30 (£18.50) a pop. 'We are striving to create an environment, a community, where two people can connect and trade seamlessly at a moment's notice,' the app's website explains. Some are worried, however, that Shout's users will start to hold these things hostage, and drive up prices. 'It's just going to perpetuate bad humanity,' said one user, who asked to remain anonymous.

And people can use Places with any business, even if they're not in the map. 'You're not at all limited to what you can see here,' said Ms Samanian.

"A New York marketing executive claims her iPhone 4S battery melted this week oozing acid that destroyed her handset, but Apple are refusing to offer her any compensation. Marketing manager Shibani Bhujle told Quartz.com the concerning meltdown occurred when the phone was turned off and sitting on her coffee table. Despite her claims, Apple are refusing to replace the handset and have told her she needs to pay $200 for her insurance to provide a new phone. Meltdown: Shibani Bhujle, a marketing manager from New York, claims her iPhone, pictured, spontaneously started melting while placed on her coffee table. There was a sudden smell of burning, she said . Beyond repair: Bhujle took the handset to a New York Apple store but was told they would not replace it for free despite the alleged battery malfunction . The New Yorker's iPhone 4S unexpectedly turned on in the incident and gave off a strong smell of burning, according to Bhujle. 'Within a minute, there was a very strong smell—it smelled like something was burning,” she told Quartz.com. 'I picked up my phone and it was very, very hot. It wouldn’t turn on. In the following minute. I couldn’t hold it because it was too hot to touch. I was panicking. I expected it to explode or something.' She was able to open the back of phone and found the lithium battery had melted of its own accord. She said she suffered some burning to her fingers when reporting the incident to her local Apple store. Bad PR? Shibani Bhujle said she couldn't understand why Apple were dealing with her case so negatively . Fifth generation: Bhujle's iPhone 4S was purchased in December 2011.

"Security firm G4S has advertised for a cleaning supervisor who can speak Polish so they can 'communicate with other members of staff'. The private contractors said candidates who speak both English and Polish would be preferred for the vacancy at Harrogate Magistrates' Court. In the advert, which was posted on its website, G4S wrote: 'Candidate who can speak both English and Polish is preferred to be able to communicate with the other members of staff.' Scroll down for video . Private contractors G4S have advertised for a cleaning supervisor who can speak Polish so they can communicate with other staff members . The advert, posted on the G4S website, says a candidate who speaks both English and Polish 'is preferred' for the vacancy at Harrogate Magistrates' Court (pictured) It says a key requirement is that the ideal candidate will also have a GCSE or equivalent in Maths and English, as well as previous cleaning experience, good communication and interpersonal skills. The advert offers £7.50 per hour - £1 more than the minimum wage - for the part-time role. A stated 'preference' on a job advert is not against employment laws because it can be argued that the preference does not stop those without the quality from applying. But the advert - which has been branded as 'discriminatory' by one politician - could raise questions over how common it is for low-skilled workers to be required to speak a foreign language. The advert for the vacancy in Harrogate came to light after a constituent complained to David Simister, the Ukip Parliamentary candidate for Harrogate and Knaresborough, that he felt the advert was discriminatory against those who only speak English. Mr Simister told MailOnline: 'This man was an experienced cleaner and thought it would be the perfect job for him. But he has decided not to apply for it - because he feels he will never get the job. 'What it says to me is that G4S is happy to employ people who cannot speak very good English, meaning they then have to employ a supervisor who speaks Polish. 'It is discriminating against those who only speak English. They are saying someone without having Polish as a language can apply - but who is going to? Last time I checked, Harrogate was an English-speaking part of the world and that should not be the case.' He added: 'I think G4S do, in the future, need to look at how they advertise jobs. I think the Ministry of Justice should also look at how its supplier is advertising for jobs. 'It is an issue that needs flagging up. UKIP is not afraid of political correctness.' A spokesman for the GMB union, which counts thousands of cleaners among its 700,000 members, said: 'GMB does not like stipulations like this that discriminate against workers. 'If there are practical communications difficulties in any workplace employers should offer the option of English language training support to existing and prospective employees.' The union is currently in a legal wrangle in Northern Ireland over a case in which a worker was allegedly not given an interview for a job on the grounds he could not speak Portuguese. The advert also says that successful applicants must have a GCSE or equivalent in English . GMB is representing David Pryle, from Co Meath, who applied for a job as an overhead electricity power linesman in 2009. The job notice specified that knowledge of Portuguese was a preferred requirement. Mr Pryle did not speak Portugese and was not invited to interview. GMB has taken the case to court, claiming it was discriminatory for the firm to request that Portuguese was preferred. Meanwhile, TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said the furore highlighted the value of equality legislation. She said: 'A case like this highlights the value of equality legislation, but if it’s scrapped then a candidate who believes they have been the victim of discrimination would not be able to do anything about it.' A G4S spokeman said: 'English GCSE is required for this role, other languages are desirable but not essential. 'As with any role, we are looking for the best people with a variety of skillsets. 'Should any candidate feel that they are suitable for a role, we'd encourage them to apply and engage with the relevant resourcing representative.' The UK-based group became unpopular with ministers after it overcharged the Government for tagging criminals. Earlier this year, the embattled firm agreed to repay more than £130m following an audit showing that taxpayers had been routinely charged for tags on criminals who were in jail, living abroad or even dead. Costs of cleaning up the scandal helped pushed the company - a member of the FTSE 100 index - to an annual loss. The controversy came after a string of other blunders by the firm. In 2011, G4S staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over Birmingham Prison Workers and put an electronic tag on a criminal's artificial limb. A year later, the firm failed to train enough guards for the London Games which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave. And in March 2013, a G4S guard at Heathrow ordered Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse to change out of her uniform before flying to the US because it was 'offensive'.","The  contractors would prefer candidates who can speak English and Polish .

"Adrian Sutil has revealed he didn't eat for two days in a desperate attempt to meet new Formula One weight regulations this season. The 31-year-old German, who is among the tallest and subsequently heavier drivers in the paddock, raced without a drinks bottle at the heat-sapping grands prix in Malaysia and Bahrain earlier this season, to keep his weight to a minimum. The limit of car and driver has been raised to 692 kilograms this year to accommodate the heavier 1.6-litre turbo engines. Weighty issue: Adrian Sutil, speaking to Lewis Hamilton, revealed he did not eat for two days earlier this year . But the sport's heaviest drivers remain at a disadvantage with every extra kilo of weight believed to cost half-a-tenth of a second. And speaking ahead of round five of this year's championship in Spain, Sutil admitted he avoided eating for 48 hours in a bid to lose weight. 'I was testing it a little bit here and there. Two days, no food, only drink. I tried,' Sutil said. 'It was not easy but interesting what the reaction is. I'm eating now again and it's better.' Smiles better: Jean-Eric Vergne, speaking to the media on Thursday, was hospitalised earlier this season . Sutil's revelations come after Toro Rosso driver Jean-Eric Vergne admitted he was hospitalised after the season opener in Australia due to a strict diet regime. Sutil added: 'I couldn't do much sport because the power was missing. I do it because I want to go on the limit just to make sure I did my maximum. I don't want to be in the car and say, ""Oh, I could have done more"". 'I could feel there was a limit where I hadn't the power anymore, the strength in my mind - you get stressed quite early - and you don't want that. It's just important to know your body quite well.

But Xu now believes that one of the needles had actually broken in half. Xu said: 'At first, I didn't feel anything, my stomach pain had gone and all was good. 'But over the years I began to feel increasing discomfort in my back and in my chest. 'Every time I went to a doctor they said it was just old age.' Eventually the pain became so bad doctors decided to X-ray him. Xu said: 'They told me there was a foreign body in my stomach and I just panicked thinking it was cancer. 'You can imagine my shock and relief when they told me it was the acupuncture needle.' Doctor Ye Lin, who carried out the surgery to remove the 3cm-long needle, said: 'It was really quite a surprise for all of us. 'The needle which was stuck in his intestines had turned black and was very thick because of decades of oxidation.' The doctors added that the needle had probably been working its way through the man's body as he moved, pushing it slowly to different positions before finally being identified 40 years later. Xu said: 'Luckily, it's now out and my pains have completely gone. And I don't have cancer so I'm a winner all round.'

"George Osborne's best man is among the employees of a hedge fund company that is set to make millions for its investors after landing a £50million stake in Royal Mail. Peter Davies is a member of the management committee at Lansdowne Partners, which saw the value of its Royal Mail shares rocket by £18million after just one day of trading. Around 36,500 people who tried to buy shares received nothing at all, while 93,000 were given the minimum offering of £750 worth. Lansdowne Partners has seen the value of its Royal Mail shares rise by £18million as prices jumped 38 per cent . In contrast 300 City firms were able to buy two thirds of the stock put on sale, bidding a whopping total of £37.3billion for just £1.7billion worth of shares. Mr Davies has been friends with the Chancellor since they met at Oxford University and was his best man when Osborne married Frances Howell in 1998 at St Margaret's Church, next to Westminster Abbey. In the first hour of trading 102million shares were bought and sold, . driving the initial price of £3.50 per share up to £4.55 at the close of . trade, leading to criticism that the service was under-valued. The Labour Party also highlighted the connection between Osbourne and Mr Davies as part of its criticism of the Royal Mail privatisation. The Chancellor met Mr Davies when they were both at Oxford and Davies served as his best man when he married Frances Howell in 1998 at St Margaret's Church, next to Westminster Abbey . A Labour source told The Telegraph: 'By selling off the Royal Mail on the cheap the taxpayer was short changed while hedge funds and friends of the Chancellor are set to rake it in. 'Once again this government puts the wrong people first.' A Conservative spokesman said the allegations were ""completely untrue"". ""At no point was George involved in, or even made aware of, the allocations,"" a spokesman said. A spokesman for Lansdowne said: ‘To be clear, it is not Lansdowne who directly benefited from these investments, rather British pension funds, charities, universities and others who entrust their money with the firm. ‘Lansdowne is a highly respected, long-term investor in UK and international businesses on behalf of our clients which include numerous UK pension funds. 'Our commitment over many months to this long-term investment opportunity, and the process followed, have been identical to those in many other IPOs. Our interaction has only been with the company management and its advisers.’ The sale has been criticised by Labour for under-valuing the business and benefiting 'the wrong people' Lansdowne Partners made a reported £100million from the financial crash in 2007 by betting against troubled bank Northern Rock in a practice known as short-selling, which has been widely criticised. Sir Paul Ruddock, Lansdowne's former chief executive, was also awarded a knighthood last year after donating £500,000 to the Conservative Party. Sir Paul has denied that his knighthood was connected with the donation and insisted it was for his services to the arts, while also downplaying the profits from short-selling. In another criticism of yesterday's sell-off, leading fund managers raised concerns that British funds had lost out to overseas investors. Sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Singapore and Norway are thought to have been allowed to invest.","Peter Davies met the Chancellor at Oxford University .

"A Melbourne man accused of murdering his neighbour over a barking dog hatched a plan to place an inflatable kangaroo on the road to send his neighbour's car swerving into a gum tree. Joseph Drago, 69, is charged with murdering Anthony Richard Dockerty, by running the 63-year-old over with his car, ending a dispute that began over Mr Dockerty's rowdy dog. But before Mr Dockerty's death, Drago had contemplated a series of bizarre revenge plots that ranged from setting a possum loose in his roof to murder, a court has heard. Police say they found plans on Drago's computer to put an inflatable kangaroo on the road at night so Mr Dockerty would crash his car into a gum tree . Police found an 'action plan' of sabotage plots against Mr Dockerty on Drago's computer, including a plan to put an inflatable kangaroo on the road at night in the hope of causing Mr Dockerty to crash. 'Hopefully crashing into a big gum tree,' the retired civil engineer wrote on his computer. He also contemplated lifting a section of the roof to put an angry possum in Mr Dockerty's house and blocking his downpipes to trigger a flood. During a bail application in the Victorian Supreme Court on Friday, Drago's barrister Constantine Helliotis QC said while the initial feud between the Balwyn North neighbours was over a barking dog, it escalated in an ongoing tit-for-tat conflict. The hearing at the Victorian Supreme Court heard there had been a feud between the neighbours over a barking dog . He said Drago never carried out any of the plots in his action plan. 'It's clearly a man who had retired having too much time on his hands,' he said. Mr Helliotis argued Drago's depression and a 14-month wait for a trial were grounds for his release. But prosecutor Andrew Tinney SC said the 'vindictive and bizarre' ramblings on Drago's computer proved he was a danger to the community. Joseph Drago and Anthony Richard Dockerty lived in Melbourne suburb of  Balwyn North . 'This indicates a person who had developed a very powerful grievance toward the person who ended up dying,' he said. 'What's to say he might not form a set against another person?' Drago had driven to the Thornbury factory where Mr Dockerty worked on December 2, 2013 to take photos of his neighbour. The pair had an altercation before Drago climbed into his car, while Mr Dockerty stood in front of the vehicle to block his escape. CCTV footage played in court captures Drago accelerating over Mr Dockerty, dragging him under his car some 116 metres down the road. Justice Paul Coghlan adjourned the application to allow further psychological testing on Drago.","Melbourne man Joseph Drago is charged with murdering neighbour Anthony Richard Dockerty because of his rowdy dog .

"A storefront in Manhattan's lower East side is advertising a bar just for pregnant women. Whether or not it's a hoax or viral marketing stunt, it's got New York residents birthing anger. The name of the so-called bar is Gestations and it's located on Fifth Street and Avenue A where pregnant women can supposedly get their alcohol fix for two, reports The New York Post. 'All you mothers-to-be should come check out our trimester specials and our 9-month happy hour because now you’re drinking for two!,' reads the storefront that has people fuming. Too much?: This advertisement for the first ever pregnant bar in Manhattan's Lower East Side has some enraged . Marketing: The campaign is pregnant with baby jokes like one they posted on their Twitter that reads, 'Never thought we'd see our baby come to life, especially with a billboard in Time Square! ‪#‎gestationsny‬' Birthing humor or hatred?: Jokes like this had critics fuming, some of whom who took to Facebook and Twitter to bash the campaign for being offensive and insensitive . The Facebook page offers a titillating image of a woman, who appears to have a photo-shopped pregnant belly, popping a champagne bottle. The Facebook page points out the fact that both pregnant women and men can drink more because they have bigger bellies. 'The bigger the belly, the more you can drink. True for men and pregnant women. #gestationsny' says a slogan for what might be a viral marketing stunt. '#gestationsny will have free pregnancy test kits when you buy a pitcher. Check out our profile on #BARTRENDr to see what else we’ll carry,' the Facebook page says. According to the website Vocativ.com, the racy new bar concept is likely a viral marketing campaign for the bar finding app Bartendr. Despite the attention grabbing technique being successful, it's a bit of a miscarriage with critics who find the campaign distasteful and offensive. It seems some may not have realized that the campaign is a farce. For real?: This is the location where the Gestations bar will allegedly be opening soon . Critics: Some angry readers didn't catch on to the fact that the campaign may be a hoax . Concerned for health: This woman voiced her concerns about the health dangers for the unborn child  associated with drinking while pregnant . 'This is really sick, a real disparate, how would you entice a pregnant woman to drink alcohol which will take effects on the unborn, this is really ridiculous. I would call on the Dept of Health, to close this stupid peoples door business that are endangering the health of the unborn. umbelievable ..!!!!!!,' writes Vallejo Rafael on Facebook. Facebook user Angela Holkmann also had a bone to pick with the campaign. 'You are promoting actions that are dangerous to the health of an unborn child. Unfortunately, many babies are born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome that produces learning and behavior disabilities as well as physical ones as well. Everyone know, that excessive drinking is equal to using drugs while pregnant. WHY would you promote this kind of behavior, and I hope that this is a joke?,' she wrote. Some however thought the campaign was funny and wrote things like, 'What a perfect place to find women already on the ­perfect birth control!' The Post reports that Community Board 3 Leader Susan Stetzer says that the bar hasn't applied for a liquor license yet so chances are it isn't a real thing. 'They’re saying it’s a bar, but they haven’t applied for a liquor license. At this point it’s nothing . . . Maybe it’s going to be a milk bar or a juice bar,' she said. 'When possible patrons call the business a voice mail of a woman says, 'visit us on October 25 at 504 East Fifth Street before that water breaks.' The campaign is pregnant with baby jokes like one they posted on their Twitter that reads, 'Never thought we'd see our baby come to life, especially with a billboard in Time Square! ‪#‎gestationsny‬' Even though patrons of the bar are meant to be expecting, no one knows what to expect from Gestations.","A storefront in Manhattan's lower East side is advertising a bar just for pregnant women called Gestations .

"Drivers in Russia were treated to unusual sight as they negotiated a busy motorway in the city of Kemerovo on Saturday night. An object, thought to be a meteor, blasted through the sky above a busy road before disappearing into the darkness. One motorist managed to catch the unusual phenomenon on a dashboard camera, showing the glowing ball shoot across the sky at high speed. Eyewitnesses in the cities of Kemerovo, Novokuznetsk and Osinniki spotted the UFO on Saturday night. They claim the alleged meteor fell silently at a high speed and became extinct shortly afterwards. The short video shows a bright light appear on the upper left area of the sky before arcing towards the right of the screen in just four seconds. It is still unknown what exactly the ball of light was, although eyewitnesses said they believed it was a meteor. Driving: The occupants of the car  in the Kemerova region film the road moments before the meteor appears . In View: The meteor comes into view just above the nearest lamp post on the left of the photograph . Moving: The meteor moves across the sky with great speed in the Kemerova region of Russia . It is not the first time this month that members of the public have reported seeing unusual objects in the sky. Earlier this month, eyewitnesses in the US reported seeing a a bright object that broke apart into three separate pieces with red glowing streaks. A glowing 'rocks' were visible from New Mexico to Montana. Visual: eyewitnesses in the cities of Kemerovo, Novokuznetsk and Osinniki claimed to have seen the meteor . Military experts believed the UFO was a Russian spy satellite, although Russia denied the claim. The object probably was a piece of Russia's Cosmos 2495 reconnaissance satellite, launched in May, said Charles Vick, an aerospace analyst with military information website Globalsecurity.org. Cosmos 2495 was designed to shoot reconnaissance photos and send the film back to Earth in capsules.","Footage was captured by the occupants of a passing car in Kemerova .

"Ronald Davies has been left 'devastated' after the death of his wife Brenda who was 40st and Britain's fattest woman when she suffered a heart attack . Britain's fattest woman who weighed 40st died of a heart attack aged 44 after being unable to walk out of her house for six years. Doctors warned Brenda Flanagan-Davies to 'lose weight or die' when she became bed-bound at her home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, after consuming more than 6,000 calories a day. But just four hours after a check-up in July 2013, where she returned home via an ambulance, her husband Ronald Davies found her foaming at the mouth and in pain. He called an ambulance, and four paramedics used a blanket to carry Mrs Flanagan-Davies to the vehicle, but she died on her way to hospital after suffering a heart attack. Mr Davies, 68, who had been with his wife for five years, now wants to warn people about the risks of obesity after he was left 'devastated' following her death. The retired labourer and water inspector, said: 'She was alive one minute and dead the next. 'I think the heart attack was down to her weight and her health. It could have happened at any time. 'I don't know what to do. When I used to sit in the living room I would talk to her. 'I still find myself speaking to her in the other room since she died but obviously there is no answer as she's not there. 'I want to warn other people to look after after themselves and not to decline help if anyone wants to give you a hand. 'I wouldn't want what happened to Brenda to happen to other people.' Mrs Flanagan-Davies was so addicted to food that she had a fridge next to her bed, crammed full of chocolate and fizzy drinks, and would get regular deliveries from the butchers, fish and chip shop and local Tesco supermarket. Brenda, pictured in 2012 before her death, was addicted to food and consumed over 6,000 calories every day . She would get regular deliveries from the butchers, fish and chip shop and local Tesco supermarket to her bed . She also kept a fridge packed full of Coca-Cola and chocolate for her convenience. She was offered a gastric band on the NHS if she could lose enough weight to prove she wanted the operation but she failed to do so . She was unable to walk just a few steps to the shower or the living room without getting out of breath. Mr Davies, who said he had worried about his wife's health, added: 'She spent most of her time in bed, she had a telly beside her but she didn't watch it. Sometimes she would have music on without the picture. 'She couldn't walk very far. She had to get assisted to get to the shower. It took two of us, myself and her carer. 'I felt sad for her. I didn't feel sorry for her, I felt sad for her. 'I did worry about her health but I didn't like to tell her in case it made her upset. I wanted her to lose the weight so she was healthy.' She was offered a gastric band by doctors if she lost enough weight to prove she wanted the £12,000 operation and when she didn't the operation was offered to somebody else. Mr Davies said: 'The doctors were telling her to lose weight. But she wasn't showing them that she was losing the weight - I think she was a bit frightened of having the operation. Her widower, Ronald Davies, says he wants to warn people about the dangers of over-eating after her death . 'She did lose quite a bit of weight so she must have been thinking about it but she didn't go through with it. 'It must have been a relief to not have the operation and she went back to her old self. 'Maybe if she had taken the help her situation would have been different.' The couple met five years ago at a community centre in Gateshead - in that time Mrs Flanagan-Davies put on 11 stone. He said: 'I thought she was a smashing girl. I never once looked at her and thought she was fat. 'A lot of men used to fancy Brenda. They would ask me if she had a boyfriend and I would say yes me. 'We broke the bed that's for sure when we first got together! 'We used to go our local pub for Sunday Lunch but I didn't notice her putting on weight. 'We had to put up with a lot of rubbish off people looking at her in the street. One day we were sitting in a car park and I was smoking. This couple were passing by staring at her, it was ridiculous. Ronald (left) and Brenda (right) had been together for five years - in that time she had gained 11 stone in weight . 'I said to Brenda, ""You would think they had never seen anybody smoke before,"" and she said ""thank you"". She knew I would support her whatever her size. 'I only wish she could have lost the weight so she could still be with me now.' Since her death last year, Mr Davies has now changed his lifestyle and his diet. He said: 'I have realised since Brenda's death that is is important to be healthy. Being healthy stands you in good stead as you get older. I feel much healthier now I am eating better. 'Brenda loved kebabs and sausages. We would get steak and kidney pies sent up from the butchers and fish and chips delivered. 'Now I have stopped getting takeaways and fatty goods delivered. 'Brenda couldn't walk, she would get out of breathe and she needed help when getting showered. 'I think if she had still been here she could have went into schools and warned children about the dangers of obesity. 'I want to make sure other people do not go down the same path as Brenda.' Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: 'There are literally ten of thousands of people who eat too much who have no idea what a danger they are placing on their health. 'At the best, disease acquired from becoming obese, such as diabetes, cardiovascular problems can not only be very unpleasant, need lifelong treatment and lead, as is the case of this lady, to a very premature death. 'If people were told that they could lose limbs to amputation or go blind just from diabetes, I cannot believe that they would overeat. It's a no-brainer: eat moderately, exercise regularly and not unnecessarily cut your life short.'","Brenda Flanagan-Davies was bed-bound at her home in Tyne and Wear .

"Every day in Britain, two people die waiting for a donor organ - and some experts believe this tragic situation needs a radical solution. Currently you have to join a register if you wish to be an organ donor, an 'opt in' system. But even if a person is on the register, some bereaved families still refuse to give permission. But from December 1 next year, Wales is changing to an 'opt out' system, where doctors will presume people have agreed to donate their organs after death, unless they have registered an objection and specifically chosen to opt out. Opt out, or 'presumed consent' systems can either be 'hard' - where the wishes of close relatives aren't considered, as in Austria, or 'soft' - where families can refuse organ donation if they think the person wouldn't have approved, as in Spain. England has no plans to follow Wales's lead. Here Caroline Scott talks to two people affected by the issue. Carla Gair had cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle . NO says Carla, although she could die waiting for a new heart . Carla Gair, 38, is waiting for a donor heart. She's divorced and lives in Southampton with her children Mai chi, 13, and Tylan, ten. She was a hairdresser before she became ill. My heart consultant told me in February that I won't be here in two to three years' time without a new heart. I've since had the most devastating conversations with my daughter. She says: 'Mummy, who's going to look after me when you die?' I just say: 'I can't promise you 100 per cent they'll find me a new heart in time, but we're 100 per cent hopeful they will.' I can't lie to my children. They already know so much: they know I have cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle that means eventually it won't be able to pump blood round my body. They know I've almost died once - I collapsed, and my heart had to be shocked back into a normal rhythm. You can't pull the wool over children's eyes. All three of us have cried together. Until eight years ago, I was fit and healthy. I danced, sang in a pop choir, had great friends, two wonderful children and loved my job. Then, in March 2007, I went to a nightclub with a couple of friends and collapsed on the dance floor. I was in intensive care for ten days and in hospital for seven weeks. I was fitted with an internal defibrillator, which shocks my heart back into a normal rhythm if it starts racing too fast, and everything seemed well. But one morning in spring 2012, I suddenly felt so ill - clammy, sick and shaky. I saw my heart consultant and I'll never forget his words: 'I think we should get you on the transplant list.' Since then I've had four calls from the hospital, with a possible donor heart. On each occasion, the organ was either diseased or not a good match. The last call was just last week. The ambulance arrived for me within an hour and I was prepped for surgery, but at the last minute they decided the heart wasn't a good enough tissue match. I rarely cry but it hit me a few days later and then the floodgates opened because I don't know how long I have left. I'm only 5ft 1in and my chest cavity is small, so if the tissue type was the right match, technically, I could take a child's heart if a small adult heart wasn't available. It's horrible and devastating even to say those words. And the only way I could take a child's heart - or anyone's heart - is if I felt the family would get a smidgen of comfort from knowing they had given me more time. That's why, even though I am desperate to go on living for my children, I think donation has to be a gift - a personal choice - rather than an obligation. I don't want anyone to feel their loved one's heart was 'taken'. What if someone meant to opt out but didn't get around to it, so I got that heart against their wishes? For me, that really matters. Carla Gair is chronically ill and is waiting for a heart transplant . In Wales the system will be 'soft', so families have a clear right of objection. But they are already dealing with the worst thing to happen to them, and the bedside of a dying relative is no place to have this conversation. I would be haunted for ever by that family's feelings. But if my donor had signed up to the donor register or expressed a wish to donate their organs, my conscience would be clear. To join the NHS organ donor register, go to organdonation.nhs.uk or call 0300 123 23 23. And don't forget to tell your family of your wishes. Most importantly, I don't think presumed consent will result in more organs becoming available. If relatives haven't had the conversation beforehand, then in the horror of the moment they will simply say no, as they do now. For me, it would be better to focus on raising awareness so more people choose to join the register. Death is still such a taboo subject and not enough people know the facts about organ donation to make an informed decision. I've met people who feel even talking about it is somehow tempting fate. Registering as a donor won't make you more likely to die, but it might help someone after you're gone. I think about death every day, but I still don't feel comfortable with the idea of an opt-out donor register. Tor was diagnosed with cystic fybrosis . YES says Tor, who owes her life to a double lung transplant . Tor Tremlett, 27, runs cake makers Scrumdiddlyumptious from her home in Romford, Essex, where she lives with her parents. She had a double lung transplant on October 10, 2011. When I was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis I was just two-and-a-half. The condition causes a build-up of sticky mucus in the lungs and digestive system, which has to be dislodged with daily physiotherapy and exercises. It dominated my childhood - Mum was told I'd probably die in my early 20s. When I was 16 my lung function began to seriously deteriorate; by the time I was 20 I couldn't move or even talk without getting breathless. At that point, I was put on the transplant list. I waited four years for donor lungs, and I can't describe how hard it was getting through every day. My back and chest felt broken from the effort of trying to breathe and I was virtually housebound. My friends were going to university and travelling, and all I could do was watch - not knowing if I'd survive the next few months. I was on a lot of morphine, and breathing with a machine. I was fed via a naso-gastric tube, and Mum had to do everything - from washing to dressing me. One day a doctor asked: 'Have you thought what you'd like to happen if you don't get a call?' She meant I needed to think about where I wanted to die. In September 2011, the doctors told Mum it was unlikely I'd make it to Christmas. Then, on October 10, I woke up to the sound of the phone ringing. There were some donor lungs, and the genetic match was as close as it could be. I went down for surgery at 4pm and came round the next evening. It took a while for me to breathe on my own, and I was terrified. But I remember looking at my nails and realising they were pink instead of blue for the first time, because oxygen was circulating properly. The transplant coordinator told me my lungs came from a young man. I couldn't stop thinking about what he'd been like and what his family was going through at the same time my family was celebrating my chance of living. Tor pictured a few days after her double lung transplant at Papworth Hospital three years ago . People I've talked to have the most bizarre reasons for not being a donor. Some fear that doctors won't fight hard enough to save their life, or that their organs might be taken before they're dead. But more often, people just haven't got around to it. So we miss a huge number who'd happily consent to give their organs - and that's why I think an opt-out system would be better. But presumed consent isn't a quick fix. There'll need to be more doctors, more beds, more transplant coordinators and more retrieval teams. And there has to be a more open discussion so people are aware they can opt out. You can sign up for an NHS donor card . If even one more person gets their transplant as a result, I would rather have that one person saved. I have lots of friends who died waiting due to the lack of suitable donors. Every year, on the anniversary of my donor's death, I write to his family through the coordinator. Sometimes I tell them something I've done, but usually it's just: 'I'm so grateful and I'm thinking about you.' I never receive a reply - and I don't expect one. But I hope the family gets some comfort from the fact I'm able to keep going because of something my donor did. I feel a responsibility to live my life not just for myself but for him - and for my friends who died waiting. There is a campaign to raise awareness of organ donation at livelifegivelife.org.uk.","Currently, you have to join a register if you wish to be an organ donor .

"A patch of land which was once worth $300,000 is set to turn a group of Melbourne family and friends into multi-millionaires. The 108ha farmland in Sunbury, northwest of Melbourne, was bought in 1982 and was considered 'the middle of nowhere' which has now transformed into a prime housing development site - worth $70 million. Ten investors, among them five brothers, told Nine News they had to borrow funds to place a deposit on the property as they were destitute at the time. The 108ha farmland in Sunbury, northwest of Melbourne, was bought in 1982 for $300,000 and is said to be worth $70 million . The ten blocks of land, ranging in size from 6.25ha to 19.59ha, is expected to be rezoned and developed into 2000 properties to create a new suburb - South Sunbury. The investors put the property on the market when they realised nearby farmland was being turned into residential areas. The sale will be divided up among them, based on the size of the blocks each investor owns. The property has ten investors, five of them brothers who are now set to make a small fortune . The ten blocks of land are expected to be rezoned and developed into 2000 properties to create a new suburb, South Sunbury . They include tradesmen, aged in their sixties and seventies, who say the property sale will help them enjoy their well-earned retirement. 'For me and my wife... we didn't have much holidays, because working hard, now we try to enjoy a little bit more than we did before,' one co-owner told Nine News. The Croatian immigrants hope to share their earnings with their family and also take trips to their home land. One of the co-owners said he will give some of the money to his grandchildren, but he and his wife will also visit their homeland in Croatia . Real estate agent Joseph Ngo said the property, which is set to officially hit the market next week, has already generated interest from buyers in China and Sweden . 'I got a grandchildren, a little bit for them and a little bit for me too,' said another co-owner. If the hobby farm is sold for $70 million, current owners will earn about $65 per square metre. Real estate agent Joseph Ngo said the property, which is set to officially hit the market next week, has already generated interest from buyers in China and Sweden. 'They do have in the pipeline a train station, of course a school, a park,' he said.","The 108ha farmland in Sunbury, northwest of Melbourne, was bought in 1982 for $300,000 .

Emery, 12, was found alongside her brothers and parents. The bodies were found shortly before 8 p.m. in the parents' bedroom . The medical examiner's office provided no time frame for the release of results of laboratory testing. The bodies were found shortly before 8 p.m. in the parents' bedroom by an older son, who is believed to be 18, according to neighbors. Their son returned home and knew something was wrong because of how quiet the house was, said Springville Police Chief J. Scott Finlayson, reported Deseret News. He then went to his grandparents' home nearby to question their whereabouts, and returned with his grandmother to find the bodies. Caron said someone either saw or talked to the family Saturday morning, but he was unsure about the last person to make contact with them. While a test of air in the house by firefighters did not find any carbon monoxide, investigators have not ruled that out as the cause of death. A police vehicle sits outside the house this week. The duplex where the family lived is located on a road leading to a high school in the city of 30,000 located just south of Provo . The front door of the house was open and the back door was cracked open before firefighters arrived, Caron said, and the gas could have ventilated before the test. The family's pets were all fine. Asked whether foul play has been ruled out, Caron said, 'I don't rule out anything ... We haven't ruled out anything except there was no violent trauma. We're going to look at everything. 'I do know when I was in there (house) I didn't see anything that would suggest a struggle ... I saw nothing like that,' he added. A Facebook tribute page has been set up to remember the family.

"A cocoa buyer examines bean in Ivory Coast, which borders Ebola-hit Liberia . Chocolate prices could soar by up to 20 per cent as a result of the Ebola outbreak in Africa, experts have warned. The cost of cocoa beans is already up 18.5 per cent year on year and there are fears the health crisis could spark further increases over the coming weeks. Manufacturers of chocolate will decide how much of the price hike they pass on to the consumer, but it is inevitable that prices of products on shop shelves in Britain will rise. The problem is the fear factor, according to analysts as the crop is good, supply is high and the countries which produce most of the world's beans have not been hit by Ebola. But these nations - Ghana and Ivory Coast mainly - do have borders with countries like Liberia where most of the 4,000 deaths to date have been recorded, said analysts Mintec. This affects transportation links in the area, migrant workers from disease affected countries but, mainly, the fear that Ebola could spread to cocoa producting nations. Around 60 per cent of the world's cocoa is farmed Ivory Coast and Ghana. Already the international market price of cocoa beans has risen 18.5 per cent in the last 12 months to £1,891 a tonne, Mintec told trade journal The Grocer. Some of that is a result of growing demand from countries like China whose consumers are fast developing Western-style tastes for chocolate that they never used to have. But signs that traders fear further increases have been shown with falling share prices for companies like Nestle in recent weeks. Cocoa butter, a key ingredient for some chocolate products, is also up year on year but only by 7 per cent so far. This all comes when good weather has produced a bumper crop, up 10 per cent this year on last to 4.3 million tonnes. Around 60 per cent of the world's cocoa is farmed in Ivory Coast and Ghana - prices of the crop have soared amid fears that Ebola could spread to the countries . Manufacturers of chocolate will decide how much of the price hike they pass on to the consumer, but it is inevitable that prices of products on shop shelves in Britain will rise . Mintec analyst Yuliya Nam-Wright said: 'Prices have been pushed up in recent weeks despite better than expected supply due to good demand and concerns the (Ebola) outbreak may spread. 'With the main harvest in progress, concerns have risen that the spread of Ebola will disrupt ban shipments as West African regions have already seen some transportation disruption.' West African countries supply around three quarters of the world's cocoa for chocolate production and for them it is also their major export. It means the crisis could affect hundreds of thousands of livelihoods in the region. Cases of Ebola have been emerging in developed countries around the world in recent weeks. Around 60 per cent of the world's cocoa is farmed in Ivory Coast and Ghana . Today, there were mixed reports that two possible Ebola patients have been quarantined at New York City's Bellevue Hospital after falling ill following their return from an Africa trip. The pair, who are believed to be adults, both have symptoms consistent with the virus, and were transported to the hospital from a New York City address, according to the New York Daily News. A US nurse has also contracted Ebola while treating 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan – the man who brought the deadly virus to America. Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas, was one of the team of medical staff who treated Mr Duncan at the Dallas Presbyterian Hospital before he died from the dreaded virus last week. The nurse, who had been monitoring her condition following her contact with the Ebola patient, admitted herself to hospital on Friday after her temperature spiked – one of the first symptoms of the deadly virus. Her condition was described as 'clincally stable' on Monday. The price of chocolate has already risen dramatically in the last year and the Ebola crisis is set to cause another surge upwards (Graph shows market price of cocoa, per metric tonne, in the last ten years .","Ghana and Ivory Coast farm 60 per cent of the world's cocoa beans .

"Britain's universities have slipped in a global league table of top learning institutions amid fierce competition from the Far East, according to a new set of international rankings. A number of the UK's universities have fallen down the world pecking order, with the nation's key centres of excellence now found in the 'golden' triangle of London, Oxford and Cambridge, it claims. Experts say the rankings are evidence of a 'power shift' from West to East with many Western universities 'starved of vital public funding' and 'losing ground'. Scroll down for video . A number of the UK's universities have fallen down the world pecking order, with the nation's key centres of excellence now found in London, Oxford and Cambridge, new rankings have revealed (file picture) The rankings show that overall, the UK is holding its position with 29 institutions in the top 200, more than any other country except the United States. But according to the latest Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2014/15, this is also two less than last year. And universities in China, Hong Kong and South Korea have made inroads this year while Germany has two more institutions in the the top 200. Experts say the rankings are evidence of a 'power shift' from West to East with many Western universities 'starved of vital public funding' and 'losing ground'. Three UK institutions have fallen out of the top 200 - Reading University, Dundee and Newcastle, according to the rankings, while St George's, University of London makes a first appearance, moving into 196th place. London has four universities in the top 40 - more than any other city in the world, and a total of seven in the top 200 - the same number as France, and more than Japan, China, Sweden and Korea, the rankings say. These are - Imperial College (9th), University College London (UCL) (22nd), London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) (34th), King's College London (KCL) (40th), Queen Mary, University of London (107th), Royal Holloway, University of London (118th) St George's, University of London (196th). While some UK universities have slipped down the rankings, including UCL, Oxford, LSE, KCL and Durham, others have risen, such as Imperial, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol and Glasgow. Oxford University (pictured), has slipped down the global rankings from second to third . The rankings rate universities worldwide on 13 measures including teaching, research and international outlook - such as numbers of overseas students and staff. In first place overall was the California Institute of Technology in the US, holding on to the top spot for the fourth year running. Harvard was second and Oxford took third place, down one from joint second last year. Rounding out the top five was Stanford University in the US in fourth, followed by Cambridge, which has moved up two places to fifth. A total of 24 Asian universities now appear in the top 200 of the rankings - up from 20 last year. Two of these - Tokyo University and the National University of Singapore - are in the top 25. Phil Baty, editor of the rankings, said: 'East Asia's top universities continue their strong upward movement in the rankings, on the back of strong government financial support, strong leadership and a strong commitment to excellence in higher education and research.' He added: 'At the same time, many Western universities, in many cases starved of vital public funding, are losing ground. 'There is much talk of a power shift from West to East, but these new world university rankings provide hard evidence of the phenomenon. 'There is little doubt that key East Asian nations have emerged as powerhouses in global higher education and research, while traditional leaders including the UK, Canada and the US, risk losing significant ground in the global knowledge economy.' Mr Baty said that the UK is continuing to 'punch above its weight' on the rankings, with elite universities still highly competitive. A number of Britain's top universities have slipped in the global rankings but the nation still has 29 institutions in the top 200 - more than any other country except the United States. The UK universities in this year's top 200 are shown below with last year's ranking in brackets. Oxford - 3rd place (2) Cambridge - 5th (7) Imperial College - 9th (10) University College London - 22nd (21) London School of Economics and Political Science - 34th (32) Edinburgh - 36th (39) Cambridge University, pictured, has gone up two places in the global rankings from seventh to fifth . King's College London - 40th (38) Manchester - 52nd (58) Bristol - 74th (79) Durham - 83rd (80) Glasgow - 94th (117) Warwick - 103rd (141) Queen Mary, University of London - 107 (114) St Andrews - 111th (117) Sussex - 111th (121) York - 113rd (100) Imperial College, pictured, is another British institution to have crept up the global pecking order . Royal Holloway, University of London - 118th (102) Sheffield - 121st (112) Lancaster - 131st (137) Southampton - 132nd (146) Leeds - 146th (139) Birmingham - 148th (153) Exeter - 154th (148) Liverpool - 157th (169) Nottingham - 171st (157) Aberdeen - 178th (188) St George's, University of London - 196th (201-225) East Anglia - 198th (174) Leicester - 199th (161) But he warned: 'Overall, the UK's representation among the world's leading universities is declining - three leading names fell out of the top 200 this year, and two others occupy 198th and 199th place. Five UK universities lost their top 400 places. 'This loss of power and influence is not good for the UK's overall competitiveness in the global knowledge economy. 'Also, the UK's power is increasingly concentrated in the South East of England - the five top UK institutions in the world are all from the South East 'golden triangle' of Oxford, Cambridge and London. 'Indeed, of the nine English universities in the world top 100, six are from London and the South East.' Professor Alice Gast, president of Imperial College London, said: 'One need only look across the campuses of universities in the top ranks of these league tables to see that great education by definition is global, with brilliant students flocking to them from all corners of the world. 'They are attracted to the likes of Imperial, not only because of the opportunities created by excellent teaching and research, but also because of the thriving intellectual and entrepreneurial atmosphere on offer. 'At Imperial, about half of our students come from outside the UK, as do almost as many of our academics. Their presence creates ties that span disciplines, cross national boundaries and endure for lifetimes. 'Just as students benefit from a university environment that represents the global spectrum of cultures and values, so does research: it is interesting that such a fiercely competitive endeavour benefits so greatly from international collaboration, essential to building the best and most competitive research teams. 'We compete better when we collaborate effectively with our competitors, and quality and impact rise.'","A number of the UK's top universities have fallen in a global league table .

"A talented unicycle rider races against a jeep in a a thrilling high speed race down a mountainside in rural Austria. Specialist unicycle rider Gerald Rosenkranz from the Graz region in Austria was chosen to ride the unicycle against the jeep as a result of a novel idea by 19-year-old Martin Gruja. Mr Gruja said he had always wanted to film a unique event that people would always remember. Daredevil rider: Specialist unicycle rider Gerald Rosenkranz raced against the jeep in the video . The teenager subsequently organised a race involving the unicycle and the  jeep which was filmed on Schöckl Mountain in Graz. Two of Mr Gruja's friends Philipp Neubauer and Moritz Wehr assisted him with the film-making process. Countryside: Mr Rosenkranz races down the mountainside as he attempts to outpace the jeep . Challenge: The jeep races through a waterlogged country road during the memorable race . Speaking about why he wanted to create the entertaining video the teenager said the unusual element of the race appealed to him. 'I think the idea with the pickup truck challenging the uni-cyclist came because I love the unusual, and I wanted to create something unique that makes people all over the world watch this and say wow,' Mr Gruja said. 'I've never seen something like that in my life, that was crazy!' During the video the unicycle is seen racing cross-country down the mountainside while the driver of the jeep takes a more conventional route on the mountain road. Bar: The unicycle rider travels through a bar and lands on a table startling drinkers during the unique race . Off again: Moments later the unicycle rider sprints off downhill again . Shortly afterwards while the confident jeep driver has pulled in for a break and a cold drink on the side of the road the uni-cyclist emerges from the bushes and rushes past the vehicle. The uni-cyclist also comically enters a bar and emerges through the other side before moving his uni-cycle up on a table which is surrounded by astonished drinkers and beer glasses. Moments later Mr Rosenkranz dashes off into the countryside again and he subsequently manages to beat his opponent in the jeep by the slenderest of margins. Mr Gruja said he was very happy that they managed to shoot the entire footage in a single day. The shoot took place between 5am and 10pm on the day of the shoot while the editing and post production took about one month.

"Wonga's founder trousered almost £1million last year despite the firm lending to thousands of people who could not afford to pay their loans back. Errol Damelin's £970,000 package - up more than a quarter on 2012 - is understood to have included a payoff of almost £700,000 for 'loss of office'. The revelation is set to heap fresh embarrassment on the firm, which authorities ordered last week to refund debts worth £220million to 330,000 of its customers. Scroll down for video . Big payoff: Wonga founder Errol Damelin pocketed almost £1million last year - despite the firm lending to thousands of people who could not afford to pay their loans back. It included £697,000 for 'loss of office' Straight talking? Wonga's TV adverts, which feature 'pensioner puppets', have been criticised at least twice by the Advertising Standards Authority. The latest came today after a complaint by the Citizens Advice Bureau . The Financial Conduct Authority found the firm had given loans to customers without enough checks to ensure they could pay them back. The regulator's action prompted Labour MP Stella Creasy to warn a million borrowers could be affected, telling MailOnline: 'Wonga is not the bad apple - the industry is a rotten barrel'. South African Mr Damelin's pay was revealed this week in Wonga's annual accounts. Despite leaving the day-to-day running of the firm in November, as the highest-paid director Mr Damelin is understood to have received a basic package of £273,000. He is also understood to have received £697,000 for 'loss of office', bringing his total pay to £970,000. Campaigning MP Stella Creasy (left) told MailOnline: 'Wonga is not the bad apple - the industry is a rotten barrel'. Mr Damelin (right) left the day-to-day running of the firm in November last year and quit in June . Payout: Wonga was ordered last week to repay £220million in debts to customers who could not afford them . By comparison, all of Wonga's other directors put together earned £252,000 last year. And Mr Damelin's pay packet saw a 29 per cent increase on 2012, when he was handed £754,000. The entrepreneur founded Wonga only seven years ago, but the firm shot to prominence with controversial TV adverts which used cartoon-like 'pensioner puppets'. In April the Advertising Standards Authority ruled an ad had confused the public about Wonga's interest rates - which were a representative APR of up to 5,853 per cent. And today the ASA banned another ad for the payday lender after the Citizens Advice Bureau complained it did not include the controversial APR rate. Entrepreneur: Mr Damelin founded Wonga in 2007 and it quickly shot to a billion-pound business . The TV ad showed a man anxiously jotting down figures on a napkin before looking at his phone calculator and seeing the amount of £153.79. An elderly lady than said: 'You appear to be in a financial quandary, young fellow. At Wonga you choose exactly how much to borrow and for how long.' She added: 'You can even pay back early and save money.' A Wonga spokesman said 'we take any ruling from the ASA seriously', but added the advert had not been on screens since June when the 'pensioner puppets' were withdrawn by the firm's new chairman Andy Haste. Mr Damelin quit as a director in June. It was claimed recently that he pocketed another £4million by selling a one per cent stake back to the company when he left its day-to-day running in November last year. Wonga declined to comment on all matters surrounding Mr Damelin's pay. Last week it emerged Wonga's profits nosedived by 53 per cent last year as it counted the cost of the 'fake letters' scandal, which was revealed in June. The firm had sent letters to thousands of its customers from non-existent law firms threatening them with legal action if they did not pay their loans back. Lending fell in Britain, from £1.17billion in 2012 to £1.15billion last year, halving profits from £84.5million to £39.7million. The decline came despite a huge increase in staff - with the wage bill soaring from £15.4million to £26.1million. And the firm opened a new office in London in October last year, expanded its office in Cape Town and signed a ten-year lease on two floors of an office block in Dublin. Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned for several years against payday lenders, told MailOnline this week: 'Wonga is not the bad apple - the industry is a rotten barrel. 'There have been 5million people borrowing from payday lenders and it was about a fifth of Wonga customers that were affected. 'I would be gobsmacked if the Financial Conduct Authority weren't applying the same lessons that they've already done to other lenders.' Highly-paid: Mr Damelin's earnings were almost four times those of all Wonga's other directors put together . The £2.8billion industry is facing its latest clampdown tomorrow, when another watchdog will set out how it should be reformed to inject more competition into the market. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has already estimated that a typical payday loan customer could be up to £60 a year better off if it was easier to shop around. Tomorrow it will set out a provisional decision on what measures it thinks should be put in place. When the £220million payout to customers was revealed last week, Wonga's new chairman Andy Haste said: 'When I joined Wonga I was made aware of concerns the FCA had already expressed around affordable lending, concerns which I shared. 'I committed to ensuring our lending is conducted in a responsible and transparent manner, delivering the best outcomes for our customers. 'I also said this would lead to a tightening of Wonga’s lending criteria and we will now be accepting far fewer applications from new and existing customers.' Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said he was 'delighted' the church withdrew its stake in Wonga . April 9: Advert banned . The Advertising Standards Authority watchdog rules a Wonga ad confused the public about its interest rates - which were a representative APR of up to 5,853 per cent. More than 30 complaints were received about the advert, which Wonga denied was misleading. June 25: Fake law firms scandal . The City watchdog orders Wonga to pay £2.6m in compensation after it sent customers who were behind with their debts letters from non-existent law firms between 2008 and 2010. July 11: Support from the Church vanishes . The Church of England announces £75,000 it had invested indirectly with Wonga is no longer with the firm. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby (right) said he was 'absolutely delighted'. July 14: A new leader promising reform . Andy Haste is announced as the replacement for founder Mr Damelin, who quit as a director in June. He vowed to repair the firm's reputation and ditched its 'pensioner puppet' mascots. September 30: Nose-diving profits . Wonga announces its 2013 profits fell by 53 per cent to £39.7million. It blamed extra costs from the fake letters scandal and compensation to 200,000 customers overcharged due to a technical hitch. October 2: £220million of debts written off . The Financial Conduct Authority orders the firm to write off the debts of 330,000 customers who took out loans while unable to pay them back. Campaigners warn up to a million borrowers could be in a similar dilemma across the industry, not just those with Wonga. October 8: £1million for founder and another advert banned . The firm's accounts reveal Errol Damelin pocketed £970,000 in 2013 - on the same day the Advertising Standards Authority rules against another 'pensioner puppet' advert which had already been withdrawn in June.","Errol Damelin was paid £970,000 including £697,000 for 'loss of office'

"Fearless Joachim Low says Germany do not fear Leo Messi and Argentina because they have a generation of players who can make World Cup history and stay on top of the world game for years to come. Low, who leads Germany into their first World Cup final since 2002, where they can become the first European side ever to lift the trophy in South America, is confident the restructuring of German football over the past ten years will build to a victorious climax at the Maracana. ‘We don’t have any fear whatsoever,’ said Low. ‘We have the necessary level of self-confidence and the respect for our opponents’ strength, but we are convinced if we impose our game, we will win. VIDEO Scroll down to preview the World Cup Final and recap on an emotional tournament . Technique: Joachim Low shows his players how it is done in Germany training ahead of the final . Relaxed: Germany forward Lukas Podolski mounts a late challenge for the number one jersey in training . In sync: Germany players stretch during training before their showpiece final against Argentina in Rio . ‘We can write history. In the past, . Latin Americans have dominated in South America all the time. This would . be considered an additional joy for us if we were to win as Europeans . on Latin American soil.’ The . German FA restructured its administration and coaching after failures . at Euro 2000 and 2004, with Low joining the coaching staff ten years . ago. He suffered World Cup semi-final defeat in 2006, as assistant, and in 2010. But the ruthless way in which Germany ripped Brazil apart in the semi-finals sent shockwaves through world football. Toni . Kroos, Thomas Muller, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Sami Khedira were all . outstanding - as was 23-year-old Andre Schurrle, who came off the bench . to score a fine brace. If the Germans win again to lift the World Cup on Sunday, Low is convinced it will not be the last time his players do so. Running riot: Germany scored four goals in six first-half minutes during Tuesday's semi-final against Brazil . Midfield battle: Germany's Sami Khedira was brilliant against Luiz Gustavo in the centre of the pitch . With . an average age of 26, this Germany squad is the sixth youngest in . Brazil. And two of their rising stars - Ilkay Gundogan and Marco Reus - . are both missing through injury. Low thinks the potential is there for . Germany to dominate world football - just as Spain did when they won . three successive major trophies, starting with Euro 2008. ‘We have players at . their peak, but we also have young players in the squad and others who . aren’t even here, players with a fantastic future,’ said Low. ‘Ilkay . Gundogan, Marco Reus, Mesut Ozil, Andre Schurrle, Thomas Muller can go . on to play on top of the world for a good few years yet, with young . players coming in to reinforce the team.’ Planning: Low and Schweinsteiger talk in training ahead of Germany's World Cup final against Argentina . Skills school: Low controls a ball with his hamstring as he joins in during Germany's training session . Multi-tasking: Schweinsteiger prepares for the final at Germany's training base in Rio . Low . has warned his team not to obsess about the threat of Messi, though . many observers see the game as a chance to elevate the Barcelona . superstar to the level of the legendary Pele and Diego Maradona if he . wins the World Cup. Low, whose side beat Argentina 4-0 in the quarter-final four years ago, said: ‘This team is not only about Messi. 'If . you believed it was, you’d be making a mistake. They have Angel Di . Maria, Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain. Their team is better organised . than in 2010 as they’ve shown over the tournament. After . their 7-1 demolition of Brazil in the semi-final, Germany are big . favourites to beat Argentina and win the World Cup in Rio. If . they are successful, it will be fourth time they have won the famous . trophy - but it will be the only occasion they have triumphed on South . American soil. Indeed, no European nation has won the tournament on this continent in four attempts. Czechoslovakia . and Holland reached the final in 1962 and 1978 respectively, but Low . hopes his team can go one better in Brazil this weekend. Sweet sixteen: Miroslav Klose became the World Cup's all-time top goalscorer with his strike against Brazil . Focus: Low stands in the middle of the group and gives instructions to his squad on the eve of the final . Ever since Germany hammered Portugal 4-0 in the group stages, they seemed destined to make Sunday's final. Their . only scare came in the second round when they needed extra-time to beat . Algeria, one of the surprise packages of the tournament. Low's optimism is also born out of the fact that he has done everything possible to get his team ready for Sunday's game - both physically and mentally. The Germany coach and his backroom staff scoured the planet on scouting missions well before the tournament began and they have been working on a plan to defeat the Argentinians ever since they swept Brazil aside in Belo Horizonte. 'Over the last few years we've travelled . and watched international football, in Europe and South America, and . we've tried to learn little things that can influence matches,' Low . said. Disciplined: Germany were ruthless against Brazil in their semi-final, scoring five in the first half . Pre-match press conference: Germany coach Joachim Low is positive of his side's chances in the final . 'We've taken on the new-fangled things that are being done. We have looked at Spain and we've looked across the border at what the Dutch are doing - how they train individual players.' That planning extends to penalty preparation too. Manuel Neuer has been tirelessly studying Argentina's penalty takers so he is primed and ready should they match go beyond extra-time. Germany have one of the best penalty records in history, but Low hopes his team win in normal time. 'We hope and expect to decide the match before,' he said. 'Penalty shoot-outs depend on so many things. 'They're an additional pressure. But all the goalkeepers are ready for that potential. We have tried to analyse the situation.' Calm: Germany's first-choice goalkeeper Manuel Neuer is confident if the final goes to penalties on Sunday . Germany and Argentina share a rich history when it comes to World Cups. Germany defeated the South American nation to win Italia '90 and four years earlier Diego Maradona captained the Argentinians to World Cup glory after a 3-2 final win over West Germany. 'It will be a gripping final between two teams who have had fascinating duels in the past,' said Low.

"David Beckham is thrilled to see Lionel Messi feature in the World Cup final and is backing the Argentina star to lead his team to victory. Messi has often faced criticism that he has not reproduced his Barcelona form on the international stage, but has played a key role as the Albiceleste progressed to Sunday's final against Germany. 'He's amazing,' Beckham said in an interview on Adidas football's YouTube channel. Impressive: Lionel Messi has helped Argentina reach the World Cup final against Germany . 'He gives people so much pleasure with the way he plays and what makes him special is he plays as a team-mate as well, a good team player. 'He's got great individual skill, but winning means everything to him. If other team-mates score goals he's the first one there to celebrate with them and I think that says a lot about him. 'Playing for Argentina, I'm sure there's a certain amount of pressure, but going as far as they've gone is incredible. It means so much to him, his family and everyone else around the world, the fact Messi's going to be playing on this stage.' Having been reluctant to offer a prediction for the final, Beckham - who will be at the game with his children - eventually tipped Argentina to triumph 3-1. He said: 'It's just amazing that these two teams have come together. 'Germany came to the tournament with great experience, people are not too surprised they've got as far as this. There's no particular star, they've just a great group that play well together. Respect: David Beckham embraces Barcelona's Lionel Messi after Champions League game . 'Argentina have a group of talented players who play with a lot of passion, but Lionel, I'm just excited to see him play.' Reviewing the tournament as a whole, Beckham relished the emergence of new teams and players on the world stage - none more so than Colombia and James Rodriguez. 'It's been a great World Cup. The fact you've seen teams like Costa Rica and Colombia perform the way they have and some great young players coming out of the competition, it's been great to see,' he said. Rodriguez was included among the nominees for FIFA's player of the tournament award after scoring six goals in Colombia's five games, most memorably a superb volley on the turn against Uruguay in the last 16. Beckham said: 'His goal for me was one of the best of the tournament - as a young player, to have that thought, the way he moved into the ball, the way he turned and struck the ball. 'I've heard about him quite a few times and people told me he was a great talent, but to come on to the world stage at his age and play the way he's played, says how talented he is. 'I think he's got a great future. He's such a talented player and he's a good-looking kid as well, he's got the whole package.'","David Beckham thrilled to Argentina star Lionel Messi in World Cup final .

"A man who was finishing his cup of coffee got more than just a caffeine buzz when he discovered what was lurking in his coffee cup. Ron Morais of Fredericton in New Brunswick in Canada removed the lid from his McDonald's morning brew to discover a dead mouse laying at the bottom.

Yuck: Ron Morais from New Brunswick said the mouse 'left a few presents in his drink'! The customer added that it looked as though the mouse had been in the cup for a while and left 'a few little, shall we say, presents' in the drink. His co-worker, Jennifer LaHaye was with Mr Morais at the time of the shocking discovery. ''Oh my God, there's a mouse in my coffee,' is what he says. I turn around and look at him,' she told the station. 'The first time I looked, I actually looked and it's real, he's not joking.' Morais said the idea of drinking an entire cup of coffee with a mouse in it made him feel a little ill. 'I kind of had a little queasiness in my stomach,' he said .

The Frenchman appeared to accept coming . third behind winner Ronaldo and second-placed Lionel Messi at the award ceremony in Zurich last Monday, even claiming that individual awards were not important to him.

"AN RSPCA whistleblower killed herself after publicly accusing the charity of killing thousands of healthy animals, an inquest heard yesterday. Animal welfare officer Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, was dismissed after arguing with her manager and later accused the organisation of putting down pets that could not be re-homed. Just five months after she helped reveal how the RSPCA had destroyed 53,000 animals in a year, the mother-of-four was discovered dead at home. Praised: Dawn Aubrey-Ward is given a certificate for rescuing a lamb while working for the animal welfare charity as an inspector . The inquest heard she was suffering . from depression after her partner Rob Colclough took his own life in . October 2011. She was also experiencing financial difficulties and had . issues with alcohol when she hanged herself at her home in Martock, . Somerset, on May 8. In a . statement read to the inquest in Wells, Somerset, her father Dennis . Aubrey said she was ‘deeply distressed’ by the whistleblowing furore. Summarising . the statement, coroner Tony Williams said: ‘Following time at the RSPCA . she was increasingly frustrated with her line manager. That led to . incidents and her being dismissed by the RSPCA. Animal lover: Ms Aubrey-Ward, 43, was found hanged at her home in Somerset in May . ‘She started a new relationship. She moved in with a new man in her life along with her children. 'Sadly in October 2011 he had himself taken his own life. 'He himself was battling with depression and that Dawn herself was devastated by that and became depressed and needed the support of family and friends around her.' Allegations: Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, said she was forced to put down healthy pets during two years working for the charity . Miss Aubrey-Ward publicly accused the charity of unnecessarily killing animals in an interview with The Mail on Sunday, published in late December last year. She had described her horror, during her time as an RSPCA inspector, at having to euthanise what she called ‘healthy animals’. Mr Aubrey added: 'Dawn expressed she was greatly distressed by that sequence of events.' She worked for the RSPCA between 2008 and 2010 and had a number of arguments with her line manager before she was dismissed. While details were not heard in the inquest, it was reported that Miss Aubrey-Ward was rebuked for refusing to issue a formal 'caution' to a devastated pensioner whose cat had contracted emphysema and was dying in his lap. She was also allegedly reprimanded for the theft of a tortoise, which she claimed to have taken home for safekeeping. She went public to tell of the horror she faced putting down animals because there was not enough room to house them in shelters. The RSPCA vigorously denied her claims and issued a statement seeking to discredit her account. In a statement issued in January, it said: 'Please be aware that Dawn Aubrey-Ward is a disgruntled former employee of the RSPCA who was subject to a disciplinary investigation for alleged theft of animals. She left the organisation with matters still pending.' Her mother Jean Newport wept as she heard about her daughter's final hours and was supported by her husband Michael and Dawn's father Dennis. Simon Ward, her husband, was also in court. The pair split up many years ago but were still married. The inquest heard her car had broken down and she had called her daughter from her first marriage Aimee Redfern-Ward, and asked her to pick up her two younger daughters from school. Meanwhile a friend gave her a lift home. She was also experiencing financial difficulties and had issues with alcohol when she took her own life at her hom . When Aimee arrived at the house with her two half-sisters, she discovered her mother's body. The inquest heard her suicide followed months of visits to her doctor, who prescribed anti-depressants and cognitive therapy sessions. Community mental health nurse Dee Holbourne said Miss Aubrey-Ward was struggling with bereavement, her finances, alcohol issues and a lack of sleep and appetite. She also thought she might be suffering from bi-polar disorder, she added. Recording a conclusion that she took her own life, coroner Mr Williams said: 'All of these pressures that were on her at the time and all of these issues for me go to that question of intent. 'Whilst I absolutely accept that in accordance with Mrs Newport's evidence that Dawn has acted on the spur of the moment without any formulated plan, I am satisfied that it is appropriate to conclude that Dawn did take her own life.'","Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, went public with her concerns about the charity .

It read: ‘As you know, as the number one democrat of the Democratic Party, I do not get in the middle of campaigns between two democrats. However, let this letter be my wink and node [sic].’ But it quickly raised red flags because it contained spelling mistakes such as the word accommodate and  the word 'Democrats was' spelled in lower case.

The unemployment rate fell from 6.1 per cent in August and is now close to 5.5 percent, which many economists consider a healthy level. U.S. employers added 248,000 jobs in September, a burst of hiring that helped drive down the unemployment rate to 5.9 per cent, the lowest since July 2008 . The percentage of unemployed who have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer fell to 32.8 per cent and average unemployment duration decreased to 33.5 weeks . The lower rate, combined with the . surge in hiring, could ratchet up pressure on the Federal Reserve to . raise its benchmark interest rate earlier than expected. Most economists . have predicted that the Fed would start raising rates in mid-2015. The job gains were broad-based and included many higher-paying industries. Professional and business services, which includes engineers, accountants and architects, added 81,000 jobs, the most in seven months. Construction companies added 16,000 jobs, manufacturing 4,000. Economists noted, however, that average hourly wages didn't budge last month, a surprising trend in light of the healthy job growth. Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist for the consulting firm McGladrey LLP, suggested that more jobs in better-paying industries haven't yet translated into higher pay because employers still have so many applicants to choose from. Stock futures rose after the news was released, a sign that investors are optimistic about the U.S. economy. The improved job growth comes after President Barack Obama touted his administration's economic achievements in a speech Thursday. The Labor Department report Friday also showed that employers added a combined 69,000 more jobs in July and August than the government had previously estimated . The economy is the top issue in voters' minds as the November elections near. The number of unemployed fell in September by 329,000 to 9.3 million. Most of them found jobs. But nearly 100,000 stopped looking for work. Their exodus lowered the percentage of Americans working or looking for work to 62.7 per cent, the lowest proportion since February 1978. Friday's report will likely intensify debate among Fed policymakers over how close the job market is to full health. Fed Chair Janet Yellen has said she is tracking many other gauges besides the unemployment rate, most of which still show scars from the Great Recession. For example, there were 7.1 million people working part-time jobs last month even though they would prefer full-time work. That figure is up from just 4.6 million before the recession. And there are 3 million people who have been out of work for more than six months. That figure has declined steadily in the past three years but is still more than double its precession total. The number of unemployed fell in September by 329,000 to 9.3 million. Most of them found jobs. But nearly 100,000 stopped looking for work . A broader measure of unemployment that includes part-time workers who would prefer full-time jobs, as well as those who have stopped searching, fell to 11.8 per cent last month from 12 per c ent in August. September's job gain means that more Americans are earning paychecks and can spend more. The annual pace of economic growth is expected to remain above 3 per cent for the rest of the year. Business investment is picking up, and consumer spending is growing at a steady if modest pace. Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank, notes that productivity — the amount of output per hour of work — is rising 1 per cent annually. LaVorgna thinks the economy is expanding at a 3 per cent annual pace and that hiring should grow roughly 2 per cent a year. That would translate into 230,000 jobs each month, he calculates. Just 287,000 people sought unemployment benefits last week, not far from a seven-year low reached in July. The number of people receiving benefits has reached an eight-year low, a sign that companies are confident enough in their customer demand to retain their staff levels. Business investment in equipment and buildings rose 9.7 per cent in the second quarter, the second-highest figure in the past three years. And orders for capital goods, a sign of future business spending, rose in August. Americans have generally spent cautiously this year, held back by sluggish wage growth. Average hourly pay has barely kept up with inflation in the past three years. A broader measure of unemployment that includes part-time workers who would prefer full-time jobs, as well as those who have stopped searching, fell to 11.8 per cent last month from 12 percent in August . But Americans spent more in August. When adjusted for inflation, spending that month rose at the fastest pace in six months. Still, there are weak spots. Home sales slipped in August as investors cut back on their purchases, and higher prices have made homes less affordable, particularly for first-time buyers who face tighter credit standards. Fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in August, the National Association of Realtors said this week. That suggests that  home sales could slip again in coming months.","The unemployment rate is now close to 5.5 percent, which many .

"A primary school teacher who molested pupils in front of other youngsters as they read out passages from a book in class was today jailed for four years. Anthony Kerr, 70, would fondle victims after he beckoned them to the front and encouraging them to sit on his knee during English reading lessons. He got away with his crimes for over three decades before nine former pupils at a primary school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, came forward to say they had been abused when they aged ten or under. At Minshull Street Crown Court, the retired Kerr, pleaded guilty to 29 offences of sexual assault and was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life. Kerr was jailed for four years after the abuse, which occurred between 1979 and 1982, was discovered by police when nine former pupils came forward claiming they had been abused . Greater Manchester Police said the offences between 1979 and 1982 related to seven different victims. Victims said Kerr, from Oldham, would ask boys to sit on his knee at the front of class while reading out load. He would then sexually assault them as they sat on his knee. Detective Constable Sue Chadwick, based at Oldham Public Protection Investigations Unit, said: 'Kerr's shocking and blatant abuse of innocent children has left a lasting scar on all his victims. 'Not only did he sexual abuse young boys, but he did it in front of the whole class. 'This added an extra element of humiliation to his crimes as the abuse was common knowledge among classmates. Minshull Street Crown Court, where Kerr first admitted to 29 sexual assault offences . 'Without the bravery of all his victims - particularly the first one to come forward - we would not be in a position to see Kerr finally receive his punishment. 'Their courage should hopefully encourage any other victims of sexual abuse to now come forward and speak to the police.' Detective Inspector Rick Collins of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This case shows that when people come forward, regardless of the time that had elapsed, we can track down and prosecute offenders successfully.

"A study has found that a quarter of teenagers in America have received explicit pictures on their cellphones (posed by models) Almost four in ten teenagers in America have received explicit pictures on their cellphones, new research reveals today. The study, by the University of Utah, also found that a fifth of youngsters have also sent a nude picture of themselves to someone else on their smartphone. This has prompted researchers to warn that the practice could be more widespread in schools and colleges than first thought. And they added that although the survey took place in the US, experts believe that the findings are applicable in most western countries where smartphones are widely used. The study surveyed 1,130 undergraduate students about their experiences of sending x-rated snaps in high school. Nearly 20 per cent reported they had sent a nude photo of themselves to another via cellphone while 38 per cent had received such a picture. Of the number who had received one of these messages, nearly one in five had forwarded the picture to someone else. Professor Don Strassberg, who conducted the study, said the risks of using a mobile phone to send intimate messages goes well beyond that of sharing print photographs as a form of flirting. He said: 'Nothing has changed in that realm - except that the technology makes it easy and thus, more vulnerable to misuse. 'You lose control of the image the moment you push send. 'From there the risks, which can be especially grave for teens, range from embarrassment and humiliation to unwanted sexual advances to cyberbullying and blackmail, and though rare, possibly to felony charges for pornography trafficking because they are minors.' The research was published online in the journal Computers in Human Behaviour and was conducted over a three-year period. Participants were students enrolled in undergraduate psychology classes and queried about their experiences of sending explicit messages during high school - after 2007, when it became more commonplace. Though the research was completed at a single, public institution, a quarter of the students surveyed attended high school outside Utah, and seven per cent outside the United States, providing a measure of economic and geographic diversity. The researchers have also warned that the practice of sending explicit pictures is more widespread in schools than first thought . Prof Strassberg added: 'Sexting is far from a rare occurrence and the ability of a recipient to forward on a sext to others can be problematic, especially for young women who share an explicit photo. 'Because once a sext has been sent, the sender has no control over who, or how many, will eventually see that picture. Other than the adolescent mentality that overestimates benefits over risks, we don’t yet know why teens are choosing to put themselves at risk.' The research also found that both men and women send explicit messages but significantly more males had received an initmate picture on their mobile phone. Professor Strassberg concluded that there are still a number of important questions about teen sexting that need reliable answers before adults can decide how - or even if - they should respond to the popular phenomenon. He said further study is needed to better understand teen motives, get a clearer sense of their appreciation of possible consequences of sexting and whether sexting increases or decreases initiation of physical sexual interaction, among other issues.","Researchers find a quarter of teens have received explicit pictures .

"A 15-year-old froze to death just yards from his home after police failed to conduct a thorough search following reports of screams at 2am, an inquest heard. Leon Cudworth was discovered in an alley in Oldham, Manchester at 7.30am on February 15 after braving temperatures of three degrees celcius wearing nothing but a flimsy jacket, T-shirt, jeans and shoes following a night out drinking with friends. His cause of death was ruled as hypothermia and acute alcohol intoxication by Home Office pathologist Dr Philip Lumb. Neighbours had awoke at 2am to hear a boy crying and shouting 'Dad, Dad' and called police. But responding officers admitted they did not examine the area fully telling the inquest that in hindsight 'we should have done more.' Leon Cudworth (pictured) was found dead on February 15, just yards from his home, after he is believed to have succumbed to hypothermia following a night out with pals . The tragedy occurred on Valentines Day this year after the popular schoolboy went for a night out at Aspins and Danielles bars in the Lees area. The teenager spoke with his father Michael at around 11.30pm telling him he was in a wine bar and would be home around midnight. But one of his neighbours on Ripponden Road, Oldham awoke in the early hours of February 15 and heard noises coming from the back of her house which overlooks an unlit alleyway. Tracy Royal said that she had heard a number of bangs adding: 'It was like a punching bang and I woke up. It was quite loud. I heard a young boy and he was shouting 'dad dad.' 'At first I thought it was someone who had been locked out, left their keys and been locked out and trying to get in. I did get up and look through the blinds and I could still hear the shouting, he was crying and sounded tired. 'I got up again to have a look at about 2.40am and looked out the window again but I didn't see anything. I thought he had got in the house. I felt awful because I could have phoned the police.' But another neighbour Sarah Collins was so concerned she phoned the police after believing she could hear a female screaming. Floral tributes were left at the scene where Leon was found on February this year after telling his dad he was at a wine bar and ""wouldn't be long"" after speaking with him on the phone . She told the inquest: 'I heard a screaming or shouting noise. I sleep with my bedroom window open so it was quite clear. Originally I thought it was some animals like foxes screeching. 'It carried on and carried on it sounded like a person. Screaming and screeching but also like mumbling noises, it sounded like a couple of people. 'That continued for quite a while and it was about 2am. I got up out of bed went downstairs and made a drink. I got back in bed after about 10 minutes and I could still hear it. 'At that point I phoned the police. I was concerned that somebody was being attacked - the volume and intensity of the noise and the length of time it was going on. The location where the schoolboy was found on the morning of February 15 this year, just yards from his home in Oldham, and a signed Manchester City football club shirt left at the scene . 'It's not unusual to hear noises but unusual to hear noises of that nature. 'It was pretty consistent at that time. I had looked out at the window but couldn't see anything.' She said she stayed up and watched the police arrive around five to 10 minutes later. She added: 'I think there were two I think one was in the car. One got out with the torch and I think one was in the car. He didn't really go far. 'He stayed quite close to the car. I know that he only looked at the land directly behind.' The patrolmen left a few minutes later. The hearing heard  PC Steven Norris, who searched the area in the hours before Leon was found dead, had got out of the patrol car but had no working torch while his colleague PC Andrew Peters, who did have a torch, had only looked in one direction and had wandered into a field. 'With hindsight we should have extended the search,' said PC Norris. 'We should have done more. What we did at the time, I thought it was sufficient.' Ripponden Road, in Oldham, where neighbours reported hearing a young lad calling out 'dad dad' while another had initially assumed that the shouting and screeching noises had been animal . PC Peters added: 'When I think back on my actions I believe that I should have checked to the right as well. At one point I heard a noise it sounded like a female, very briefly, but it was quite a distance away. If I believed the noise was coming from anywhere nearby I would have investigated.' Leon's father told the hearing he had made contact with his son who said that 'he wouldn't be long.' He then went to bed and although he was a 'light sleeper' woke up the following morning at at 9am realised that Leon wasn't in his bed and tried calling him on his phone. He said: 'I spoke to a couple of his friends who he was with the night before to see if he was there, both were surprised that he wasn't home.' He told the inquest that he was to see a police cordon close to his home and received a text message from a friend saying that police had found a body. He added: 'I said Leon hadn't come home. I just needed to know - my mind was all over the place. I went back up and spoke to the police.' Floral tributes were left at the scene where Leon was found after it is feared he succumbed to hypothermia . The hearing at Heywood Coroner's Court, was told Leon was the youngest of four children and that he had grown up to be 'lively and fun' and a popular sportsman, playing both football and rugby and riding BMX bokes. Tests showed he suffered from hypothermia and would have been more than twice the legal limit for driving. Toxicology tests revealed Leon's blood alcohol level was 173 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit for driving is 80mg. Home Office pathologist Dr Lumb said it was very difficult to determine when Leon had died. He added:  'One of the main risk factors in this case is alcohol it can cause significant risk of hypothermia developing, judgement could be poor, may not realise that getting cold. 'Alcohol concentration was high it may have affected judgement hypothermia can develop relatively quickly. The cold can kill within minutes hypothermia causes confusion as well.' The inquest continues.","Leon Cudworth was found by a passer-by yards from his Manchester home .

"The always opinionated Rosie O'Donnell has come under fire for defending a statement made by another opinionated woman - Chrissy Teigen. As the shooting in Canada's Parliament was underway Wednesday morning Teigen wrote on Twitter, 'Active shooting in Canada, or as we call it in America, Wednesday.' O'Donnell defended Teigen's statement as an astute observation on American gun culture, and when she did experienced some major backlash. Scroll down for video . Coming to her defense: Rosie O'Donnell (left) has come under fire for defending a statement made by Chrissy Teigen (right) about the shooting in Ottawa yesterday . Good observation: Teigen wrote a tweet (above) meant to comment on the wide number of shootings that happen every day in the United States . Don't got her back: Even O'Donnell's co-hosts on The View (above) would not agree with her thoughts . 'I thought it was brilliant and on-point, but some people thought it was insensitive,' O'Donnell said of Teigen's tweet Thursday morning on The View. She also brought up the fact that many shootings are the result of mentally ill individuals getting their hands on guns, and not terrorism, something her co-host Nicole Wallace took her to task for. 'I know it's important to you that mental health is always raised as a possible, unaddressed cause. It's also possible that he was an evil terrorist, OK?' said the former adviser to failed vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. 'So I don't want that to get lost.' O'Donnell responded by bringing up the fact that 86 people a day are killed in America because of guns. 'I think she's saying: I'm an American, I live here. I see two people shot this week in Canada and the entire country of Canada is in mourning,' she explained. 'However, in America this happens on a daily day basis and we don't even pay attention anymore.' Shooter: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (above) killed a solider and opened fire on Parliament before being shoot dead himself . Backing up her thoughts: Teigen refused to back down after coming under fire on Twitter (above) Sorting things out: A short while later she composed a tweet trying to explain her thoughts (above) That's when the tweets started rolling in attacking the 52-year-old, who has never been shy about sharing her thoughts and beliefs. 'What Rosie said on the view today about Canada was not okay. Terrorists are terrorists and it's not just a typical shooting,' wrote Kylie Briggs on Twitter. Angela Woodward said, 'I don't think someone attacks your president everyday Rosie O'Donnell. I've changed the channel today.' Even Teigen, 28, tried to explain what she was saying, writing after her first tweet, 'Sorry you don't understand that is a knock at america and our issues with gun control. No one is minimizing the Ottawa shooting.' She also said of her statement, 'That's not a joke. It is a fact.' Nice hubby: Teigen and her husband John Legend (above) recently celebrated their first anniversary . Horrific behavior: Earlier today Teigen signed off from Twitter (above) after receiving numerous death threats . The model and television host, who is married to singer John Legend, got it even worse than O'Donnell however, as the popular fixture on social media announced she was leaving Twitter following a barrage of death threats over her statement. One person went so far as to write on Twitter, 'I hope someone murders someone you love, like your fa**ot husband.' That seems to have been the final straw. 'I feel sick. Bye Twitter.

Captain Carlo Montu was flying a single-engine bi-plane at a height of just 18 feet on a bombing run over Tobruk in 1912 when a solider shot him, making him the first airborne casualty. Fortunately Cpt. Montu did not crash, and instead made it back to base where the bullet was extracted and made into a pendant, which he wore around his neck. Captain Carlo Montu (front) was one of five pilots who formed the first wartime squadron, carrying out reconnaissance missions and bombing raids during the Italian-Turkish War of 1911-1912 . The Italian-Turkish War, which lasted from September 29, 1911, to October 18, 1912 and saw the Italians capture Tripoli, featured the first use of aircraft in conflict. Cpt. Montu was one of five pilots who made up the first ever wartime squadron under to command of Captain Carlo Piazza. Italian forces were ordered to attack Tripoli, which was then in Libya, and the pilots took a consignment of nine early wooden bi-planes and monoplanes with them. The aircraft had almost no armour to speak of, and travelled at only a few miles an hour when fully loaded with pilots and weapons. Among the craft were the Etrich Taube, which was commonly used during the First World War, and an early version of the Nieuport 10, which was later taken up by the Royal Naval Air Service. The planes were mostly used for intelligence gathering, and had cameras which could be fitted, but for bombing runs relied on hand-held devices which the pilots would drop over the side. Captain Piazza became the first pilot to use an aeroplane during a conflict at 6.19am on October 23, 1911, when he took off to survey enemy positions. Captain Riccardo Moizo became the first pilot to take damage after discovering a base filled with 6,000 Turkish troops who opened fire, putting three hole in his wing, while Second Lieutenant Giulio Gavotti became the first pilot to drop handheld bombs on the enemy. While Cpt Montu was the first pilot to be injured, the first pilot to die was another man named Piero Manzini, and the first to become captured was their commander Cpt. Piazza. Cpt. Montu (far right) became the first pilot ever to be injured after he was shot by a rifleman while flying at just 18ft over Tobruk in 1912. He survived, and had the bullet taken out and made into a pendant (left) He was forced to land behind enemy lines in 1912 after his plane developed engine trouble, and was not released from captivity until November the following year. Montu was born in 1869, and before he rose to fame as a pilot, he also had a football career with International Turin, playing between 1891 and 1898. By the end of the war Montu was known as a pioneering airman, and went on to serve during the First World War, where he was highly decorated for his bravery. Cpt Montu also served during the Second World War, though did not fight and instead advise dleaders on how best to deploy aircraft in battle. Montu would later go on to be involved in both politics and sport, becoming a proponent of the Olympic movement, and serving as Vice President of the Olympic Committee in 1915. He also used his experience as a pilot to teach flying lessons, and wrote books about his life. The archive includes letters commenting on Montu's early aviation course and an autobiography for which mentions his war-wounding and lists his achievements and awards  in civil aviation. The collection also includes letters from Montu to Contessa Caproni, the wife of aircraft manufacturer Gianni Caproni, who established Italy's first aircraft museum in 1927. It will be sold by Dreweatts & Bloomsbury Auctions at their auction house in Mayfair, London, on November 13 and is expected to fetch up to £6,000.","Captain Carlo Montu was first pilot to be wounded after being shot in 1912 .

"A pensioner was stabbed to death with a World War One bayonet because he had refused to buy another drinker a pint, a court heard. Brian Kemp, 71, was sitting quietly at a table at the Black Horse pub, when Nicholas Jamieson struck 'out of nowhere'. Mr Kemp, from Nottingham, was on holiday in Sidmouth, Devon, when he was attacked. Exeter Crown Court heard Jamieson went back to his drink and smirked after the unprovoked incident, and then offered to help the dying man. The pub's CCTV system captured footage of Mr Kemp's ordeal. It was due to be played in court today, but the judge intervened to say playing the 'shocking' video was not necessary. Jamieson, 43, denied murder but admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility – a plea that was accepted by the Crown. The court heard Brian Kemp, 71, was stabbed to death by Jamieson in the Black Horse pub, pictured, in Devon. He denied murder but admitted manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility . Prosecutor Simon Laws QC said: 'This was a completely unprovoked killing of an elderly man by the defendant with a serious psychotic illness.' He said Jamieson, who lived opposite the Black Horse pub in the seaside resort, had bought the long bladed bayonet in April 2013 for £90. He added that neighbours heard Jamieson 'throwing it into the floorboards' in his flat and spent time sharpening it on a sharpening stone and using a cloth to oil it. Mr Laws said Jamieson told doctors that 'he could see the death it caused and the deaths it would cause'. He said he could see 'both its past and its future'. Neighbours complained that heavy drinking Jamieson played loud music at night and shouted and swore loudly to himself. Jamieson used the pub and was seen by staff and customers as being 'strange' but not violent or physically aggressive. But in the night in question, in September, Jamieson had drunk least five pints during the day and evening. Mr Kemp was on his own and noticed that Jamieson was pestering a woman at the bar who he wanted to talk to but she had told him to go away. Mr Laws said: 'Mr Kemp expressed his disapproval at what he was doing at one stage by tutting. It is not clear whether Jamieson noticed that.' He said that Jamieson then asked Mr Kemp to buy him a pint, but the pensioner politely told him 'no'. Exeter Crown Court, pictured, heard Nicholas Jamieson attacked the pensioner 'out of nowhere' and after the incident, smirked and then asked if he could help . Jamieson replied 'that's f***ing rude' to Mr Kemp. Mr Laws said: 'As Mr Kemp nursed his pint at 10pm Jamieson removed from his jacket his bayonet. He moved purposely to Mr Kemp and stabbed him in his chest. 'Nobody could have predicted it, coming out of nowhere. Brian Kemp did not see it coming at all. 'Mr Kemp slumped to his knees and Jamieson went back to his bar stool with a 'smile or smirk on his face' and carried on drinking. 'He did not acknowledge what he had done, said the landlord, and as a doctor and nurse tried to help the fatally injured customer Jamieson asked 'if he could do anything to help'. 'A customer replied he had done enough.' Mr Kemp's family paid tribute to 'a quiet, gentle character' who kept himself to himself. 'We are saddened and bitter that this has happened as Brian was having a pint, minding his own business,' they said. Judge Francis Gilbert made a hospital order and said: 'It was a horrific crime. Mr Kemp was a stranger to the defendant. 'Mr Kemp entirely reasonably declined to buy him a drink.' Forensic psychiatrists agreed that Jamieson was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and backed the S37 hospital order and restriction order. Detective Inspector Gregg Dawe added: 'This was a particularly vicious and senseless attack on an innocent defenceless man. 'It was also very distressing for those who were present and witnessed the incident at the time.'","Brian Kemp, from Nottingham, was attacked by Nicholas Jamieson, 43 .

"A father-of-four claims he could have been decapitated when he crashed into a 'booby trap' while riding his dirt bike on a popular bush track. Craig Billiet saw the barbed wired strung across the track between Little Creek and Emmerdale, north of Brisbane, Queensland, just in time as he was riding at speed on Tuesday at around 12pm. Mr Billiet, 34, said the barbed wire was at neck height on the track and he saw it just in time to stick his arm up to protect himself. 'I'm lucky I saw it before it hit me and was able to put my arm up - it got the brunt of it, ' Mr Billiet told Daily Mail Australia.

"Sales of Ebola 'survival packs' are soaring amid fears the pandemic will soon spread further around the world. Some of the packs on sale online include everything from boiler suits and face masks to hand santisers and information books. Scores of companies and sellers are now advertising the kits for sale - with some products being offered for as little as £2.99. 'Recommended': A spokesman for the firm selling the masks said they had sold 'hundreds' since the outbreak . Products for sale include a £37.50 'liquid-tight coverall' and a £2 book on how to survive the outbreak . The spending spree has been fuelled by fears the virus could soon come to the UK. Above, staff at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, take part in a drill to practise treating suspected ebola cases . Face masks are among the many products people are  buying in a bid to protect themselves from the virus . One of the packs, including a 'Honeywell liquid tight safety coverall with integrated gloves', is being sold for £37.50 on Amazon.co.uk in medium, large and extra-large. Another 'personal protection kit' is advertised for £9 on eBay as being able to defend against Ebola. It includes a hooded coverall, face masks, gloves, a hair net, heavy duty PVC shoe covers, protective glasses, disinfectant wipes and a clinical waste bag. Amazon users can also buy a pack of 10 face masks 'recommended' by the World Health Organisation for 'protection against Ebola'. The £2.99 product is being sold by a Rochdale-based seller named Nightingale Nursing Supplies. A spokesman for the firm said: 'We have sold hundreds since the Ebola outbreak, they are selling quite well, sales are increasing.' British firms have reported a surge in demand after a similar products, like the ones above, were sold in the US . But others are trying to cash on the outbreak with sick T-shirts making fun of the killer virus . Sales of kits like this one, at mtrsuperstore.com, are soaring online, as people rush to protect themselves . The spokesman added: 'They are going out to people across the country, some nurses, but mainly members of the public.' Other masks sold on the two websites include one which comes with a visor and another described as a gas mask costing £149.90. A book by author Steven King called Ebola Survival Guide 2015: 10 Things You Must Know To Survive The Coming Ebola Outbreak!, is also being offered on Amazon as a Kindle download. The Ebola outbreak is thought to have started in Guinea in December last year. Deaths from the virus then rose rapidly in West Africa this summer and now top 4,000. World Health Organisation director-general Margaret Chan said the Ebola outbreak has proved 'the world is ill-prepared to respond to any severe, sustained, and threatening public health emergency'. In a statement to a regional health conference in the Philippines, she said: 'I have never seen a health event threaten the very survival of societies and governments in already very poor countries.' Hand sanitisers and disinfectant sprays citing Ebola in the product descriptions are also on sale. But other suppliers are selling sick products which mock the disease, which has already claimed 4,000 lives. They include a T-shirt which reads 'Ask me about Ebola' but can then be pulled over the person's head to reveal an image of a gas mask. Another sick t-shirt states 'keep calm it's only Ebola' and a car sticker featuring a 'hazardous' sign with the words 'Ebola is coming' printed on it is also on sale. News of the boom in sales comes after London mayor Boris Johnson said he fears the disease will soon move to Britain, with the capital the first city hit. The World Health Organization today called the Ebola outbreak 'the most severe, acute health emergency seen in modern times'. It added that economic disruption can be curbed if people are educated so they don't make any irrational moves to dodge infection. WHO Director-General Margaret Chan, citing World Bank figures, said 90 per cent of economic costs of any outbreak 'come from irrational and disorganised efforts of the public to avoid infection.' 'We are seeing, right now, how this virus can disrupt economies and societies around the world,' she said, but added that adequately educating the public was a 'good defense strategy' and would allow governments to prevent economic disruptions.","Packs including boiler suits, sanitisers and safety goggles for sale online .

"England are aiming to run away with the game against South Africa and out-pace the Springboks this weekend - with the help of sprint legend Michael Johnson. Johnson, who won four Olympic and eight world championship golds, was snapped alongside England full back Mike Brown and Red Rose centre Kyle Eastmond on Tuesday.

Michael Johnson (centre) met with England stars including Mike Brown (left) and Kyle Eastmond on Tuesday . England succumbed to a 24-21 loss to New Zealand last weekend but host South Africa on Saturday . The Northampton forward posted on Twitter in jest: 'Exchanged some scrum and sprint tips with the man Michael Johnson today. Pleasure to meet one of the greatest @MJGold.' Known as 'The Man with the Golden Shoes' after the bold and brash footwear Johnson sported during his home Olympics at Atlanta 1996 - when he won the 200m and 400m titles - the American track and field sensation has studied sprinting technique since retiring from the sport. He has also provided sprinting advice to the likes of the England football team, as well as Arsenal and other Premier League sides. Meanwhile Brown, who has arguably been England's standout player of the last 12 months and is among the leading full backs in world rugby, accompanied the photo with the caption: 'Great to meet this legend of sport today!

"Sebastian Vettel is hoping a chassis change will speak volumes when it comes to kickstarting his Formula One title challenge this year. Red Bull confirmed Vettel will drive with a new chassis throughout the Spanish Grand Prix weekend, that begins with practice on Friday. Although the chassis in question is not brand new as it was used in pre-season testing, it is new for a grand prix weekend given the 26-year-old claimed the old one 'isn't talking to me'. On the up? Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel is hoping a chassis change helps kickstart his season . Vettel currently trails Mercedes' Nico Rosberg by 46 points after a tough start to the defence of his fourth championship, in particular twice being asked to allow by team-mate Daniel Ricciardo. Vettel concedes he is struggling to adapt to the new car that has been altered dramatically in light of the new regulations that came into force at the start of the year. 'We all have our own style as to how we like to drive the car, how to set up the car,' said Vettel. 'In general I don't mind when the rear of the car is moving, that it suffers with oversteer. 'But when . the car slides too much, you find yourself correcting more than actually . being able to push or get the maximum out of it and it slows you down. That has been part of the problem so far. 'There . are lots of reasons behind it. It would be nice to have just one . problem and one fix, but obviously the car is a lot more complex this . year. There are a lot more factors than just the car set-up. 'We've already improved a lot, but there's obviously a lot to do, and we are still learning.' In . Vettel's mind the reason behind the chassis change is to cover all . bases and to ensure there is fundamentally nothing wrong with them. Man on top: Sportsmail's Nico Rosberg leads the drivers' championship and is ahead of Vettel by 46 points . Fine margins: Vettel insists there isn't an awful lot wrong with his car but it needs minor tweaks . 'We concluded after China, where we were quite a little bit behind, to change the chassis,' added Vettel. 'It's actually not a new chassis, it's an old one we used in testing in the winter, and we have some experience with it. 'It's more a sanity check rather than a real problem with the other chassis. It's just to try everything we can and basically reset and start again. 'As I say, there is still a lot of work ahead of us as I'm not as happy as I want to be. But it's a long process, a lot of things have changed we need to be patient.'","Red Bull driver hopes chassis change will kickstart season .

'I wouldn’t have allowed that because I would have gone out to talk about it and clarify the issue a bit so that it didn’t get blown out of proportion and so that people knew the problem.

Diego Costa celebrates scoring the winner for Chelsea after being left out of the Spain squad . ‘It’s difficult to set rules, there always needs to be an element of tact on matters like these.

"Lewis Hamilton has punctured sport’s boom industry — the vogue for psychologists. The championship favourite was reacting to the revelation that his Mercedes team hired Dr Ceri Evans, who prepared the All Blacks for their rugby World Cup triumph in 2011, to work at the last race in China. VIDEO: Scroll down for Hamilton in Mercedes' simulator testing ahead of the Barcelona GP . Confident: Lewis Hamilton insists he has no plans to use a sports psychologist . Mobbed: The crowds flocked to get a glimpse of Hamilton on his arrival at the circuit . Evans, 50, was in the garage to see how engineers and mechanics coped with moments of stress. He did not, however, count drivers Hamilton and Nico Rosberg among his patients. And nor will he ever — at least in Hamilton’s case. Asked if he had thought of engaging a mind coach, Hamilton said: ‘Never. Never needed one and will never have one. So we’ll never speak of it again unless I start going crazy. In form: Hamilton is in search of his fourth-straight win at the weeekend . ‘(Evans being in China) had zero impact on me. I don’t speak to anyone like that. ‘Since I was 10 I’ve won pretty much every championship I’ve competed in. I’ve never had a mind coach, so why change it?’ Hamilton is seeking his 26th career victory — and fourth consecutive win — here in Barcelona on Sunday, but said: ‘To come in here and say, “four in a row and if I get that then I’ll win the championship” is a load of bull.

"Reality TV star Frankie Essex has put an end to her yo-yo dieting, which she says has plagued her for the last 10 years. Until now, the TOWIE star had been unable to break out of the 'big horrible' cycle which has seen her weight shoot up and down. She embraced a new healthier lifestyle two months ago - working out with a personal trainer four times a week and eating a clean diet - and it's certainly paid off. Scroll down for video . New woman: Frankie Essex, who found fame on The Only Way Is Essex, has shed two stone, taking her to her ideal weight of 10st 7lb after embarking on a healthy new regime . Since then, Frankie, who is 5 ft 7in, has lost two stone - slimming down to her ideal weight of 10st 7lb. And she is sure that this time she will keep off the weight for good. She feels so much slimmer and sexier that she is now planning a second breast augmentation - having previously had implants taking her up to a 32G. Frankie, 27, said: 'I do feel like a new woman. I was panic-stricken when I first started working out with the trainer. 'I didn't think I would be able to cope and there were times when I was so worried about it that I had difficulty breathing. 'But once I got into a regular routine, I could really feel my life turning around. I now feel so much more confident and healthier.' Before and after: Frankie blames her stint on TOWIE, where she would eat takeaway and drink wine at 10am, for gaining weight and after years of yo-yo dieting, she is finally happy in her body . Looking to the future: Frankie says that she feels so much slimmer and sexier that she is now planning a second breast augmentation - having previously had implants taking her up to a 32G . Frankie dates her yo-yo weight problems back to her mother Tina's suicide 14 years ago. Tina, who was 38 at the time, hanged herself after suffering from depression and Frankie and her TOWIE star brother Joey, 24, were brought up by their father Donny, 53, who works at Billingsgate fish market in London. Frankie said: 'I started to put on a lot of weight. My dad was amazing bringing us up but cooking wasn't his strong point. 'I used to live off microwave meals and I started piling on the pounds.' Frankie went on her first crash diet at 18 when her weight peaked at 12st 7lb. She lost three stone very quickly but it left her with sagging skin around her tummy and arms. Great loss: Frankie says that after her mother Tina, who was 38 at the time, hanged herself after suffering from depression, Frankie would live off ready meals . Bright future: Frankie quit The Only Way Is Essex last year after nine series. She is now a successful businesswoman with her own haircare range . She explained: 'I lost the weight too quickly and without embracing a healthier lifestyle. I was way too skinny and it left me with a lot of loose skin, particularly around my tummy. 'It was embarrassing because people mistakenly thought I'd previously had a child and the sagging skin was baby fat as a result of the pregnancy. 'It wasn't at all - it was just down this diet. I’ve never had a child.' Frankie continued on this destructive cycle of losing weight and then putting it all on again through binge eating and partying. Feeling insecure: Frankie said it was embarrassing that people mistakenly thought she had previously had a child and the sagging skin was baby fat as a result of the pregnancy . She knew she had to make a permanent lifestyle change to end the nightmare. That happened when she signed up with celebrity weightloss trainer Ian Guildford, who has helped Binky Felstead and Luisa Zissman lose weight. They started working out four times a week and Ian recommended Frankie started using Forza Supplements' Raspberry K2 capsules. Frankie said: 'The Forza K2s made a big difference. They gave me more energy before my sessions with Ian and they sped up my metabolism. 'I'd often forget about food because I simply didn't feel hungry. This was the first time that I have really got to grips with a proper exercise regime. 'I'm addicted to it now and won't go back to my old lifestyle. I love the feeling of wellbeing it gives me. 'The days of my weight yo-yoing are over.' Hard work pays off: Frankie signed up with celebrity weight loss trainer Ian Guildford, who has helped Binky Felstead and Luisa Zissman lose weight . Frankie quit The Only Way Is Essex last year after nine series. She is now a successful businesswoman with her own haircare range and lives with her boyfriend John Lyons, 28, a painter and decorator, in Buckhurst Hill, Essex. She had a breast enhancement two years ago - going from 32D to 32G, but she is now thinking of having a reduction or possibly new implants to make her bust smaller. She doesn't miss the ITV show that sky-rocketed her to fame - and says it wrecked her diet plans. She said: 'I'd had enough in the end. We lived off Domino's Pizza and we'd be eating and drinking at all the wrong times. I'd be drinking glasses of wine and filming nightclub scenes at 10am!' She was proud to be one of the  'real girls' along with Lauren Goodger, another of the show's stars who has struggled with her weight. Frankie said: 'I remember going away to Miami with Lauren and we were both pictured on the beach looking absolutely awful. I looked at the magazines and thought: ""Oh my God, what the hell do we look like"". 'We both promised that we would lose weight after seeing the pictures and we both did get thinner. The trouble was the weight went back on a few weeks later.' Despite her weight loss, she knows she will always be curvy 'I have got hips and I am not offended at being called pear-shaped - that is the way I am. 8am breakfast - two poached eggs and smoked salmon . 10am Forza Rasberry K2 supplement . 11am - 90 minutes fitness training . 1pm lunch - grilled chicken and salad . 6pm dinner - grilled monkfish and asparagus . 'I love my curves and have always been comfortable with my figure. Kim Kardashian has done a lot to make curvier women feel good about themselves. She showed you don't have to be stick insect like Kate Moss to look good.' Frankie admits being overweight left her feeling depressed. 'You look at pictures of yourself and you think, ""I am disgusting,""' she said. 'You end up hating yourself and getting into a real hole. It is not healthy.' Frankie envies her brother Joey, who is stick-thin yet eats what he likes. She said: 'We are very different in that respect. I only have to look at a cake and it appears on my thighs. 'Joey is very lucky - he has always had an amazing body without even trying. He lost three stone when he was in the jungle on I'm A Celebrity. He was dangerously thin when he came out but he soon recovered and got his old zip back.' As well as taking the supplements, Frankie says she has lost weight by using a smaller plate. She explained: 'I hate leaving food and always like to clear my plate. I find it helpful to use a smaller plate - psychologically the meal seems bigger if it is piled up on a smaller plate rather than spread out over a bigger. 'You feel fuller when you have finished it - it works for me!'

"From bad fashion choices to an undying devotion to boy bands, writer Alison Perry, 35, took a trip down memory lane in a recent blog post as she remembered the highs and lows of being a teenager in the 90s. The post had some members of the FEMAIL team crying with laughter, while the younger writers looked blank at the mentions of Live & Kicking or a trip to Blockbuster on a Saturday night. Here we have reprinted 15 of our favourites, to read the full blog post and more from Alison visit her blog notanothermummyblog.com. It was acceptable in the 90s: Alison Perry lists the things most 90s teenage girls will have experienced . 1. It wasn’t Saturday afternoon without a visit to The Body Shop to spend your pocket money on a kiwi lip balm. Or if you were splashing out, White Musk perfume. 2. You were addicted to playing Tetris on the GameBoy. And you may have owned a Tamagotchi. 3. You went to see Titanic at the cinema three times – and cried when Leo died, every time ('Jack! Come back!') 4. You decided if you ever got a tattoo, it would be Mark Owen's dolphin or Mel C's celtic arm chain. Both totally amazing. Virtual friend: A Tamogotchi was a girls best friend as a 90s teen . Style icon: Tattoo inspiration would have come from none other than Mel C, whose chain arm band was the envy of many teenage girls . 5. School holidays were spent watching Saved By The Bell (you really wanted to be Kelly Kapowski), listening to Pulp, Blur and Oasis on your Walkman and avoiding any homework or revision. 6. Thanks to Neighbours and Home & Away, you thought Australia was the best place ever, and you perfected your Aussie accent by saying phrases like 'Let's jump in the ute!', 'Have you fed the chooks?' and 'Strewth, mate!' 7. You had to wait until 6pm to call your friends, to get the cheaper call rate. Then you'd spend at least an hour chatting to them, despite having seen them that day at school. 8. You cried when Robbie left Take That. And actually considered calling the helpline set up for distraught fans. Heart breaking: For many teenage girls, the crisis of their youth came when Robbie Williams left Take That . Cult classic: When it came to film choices, Clueless was always up there . 9. Your hair didn't thank you for the perm. Or the Sun-In bleach you sprayed on it. The Wella Toners and Shaders were much kinder to it. But the bright blue hair mascara just looked ridiculous. 10. Going to the video shop on a Saturday night was the highlight of the week. You'd spend at least ten minutes deciding whether to rent Clueless, Wayne's World or Speed. 11. Why would you use a normal hair bobble when you could use a scrunchie? 12. You knew all the words to Let's Get Ready To Rhumble by PJ & Duncan. And at least two verses of Coolio's Gangsta's Paradise. 13. Friends was something that was only on TV once a week. And every episode you watched was brand new! Oh happy days. 14. You pretended you were too old for it, but Saturday mornings were all about sitting in your PJs, watching Going Live or Live And Kicking. Trev and Simon swinging their pants, Gordon the Gopher, Edd the Duck, Andi Peters – all heroes. 15. You saw Mel Blatt from All Saints perform onstage with her baby bump hanging out of her crop top and cargo pants, and thought it was a look you'd definitely copy when you were grown up and had babies . Saturday mornings: As much as you didn't want to admit it, the start to your weekend always involved watching Live and Kicking . No repeats: Friends was only on once a week, and every episode was brand new . Top tunes: Knowing the words to PJ & Duncan's Let's Get Ready to Rhumble was crucial .","Writer and blogger Alison Perry has written about things 90s females will have experienced .

"Public hospitals in New York City are concerned enough about Ebola that they've secretly been sending actors with mock symptoms into emergency rooms to test how good the triage staff is at identifying and isolating possible cases. A small hospital in the Ohio countryside has hung up signs, imploring patients to let nurses know immediately if they have traveled recently to West Africa. And across the U.S., one of the nation's largest ambulance companies has put together step-by-step instructions on how to wrap the interior of a rig with plastic sheeting while transporting a patient. Scroll down for video . Ready: New York Hospitals have been tested by actors pretending to have Ebola. Pictured is Bellevue Hospital Center, displaying an isolation room which could be used for an Ebola patient . Protected: The workers wear helmets and layers of protective gear to fend off any potential infection . Ebola has yet to infect a single person on U.S. soil — the one confirmed case here involves a man who contracted the virus overseas. But health care providers are worried enough that they are taking a wide variety of precautions. It isn't yet clear whether those preparations are overkill, or not nearly enough. But medical officials and health experts say that, at the very least, the scare is giving them a chance to reinforce and test infection control procedures. 'The attention has been, in a sad way, very helpful,' said Dr. Richard Wenzel, an epidemiologist at Virginia Commonwealth University and a former president of the International Society for Infectious Diseases. He said even small hospitals far from hubs of international travel should be reviewing their protocols and screening questions now, and potentially buying protective equipment such as face masks and protective suits, to avoid a repeat of the problems that occurred at a hospital in Dallas, where a man with Ebola was sent home — only to be readmitted two days later. Screening: Passengers from the Ebola heartlands in West Africa will now be tested on arrival at airports including New York's JFK (pictured) 'The debacle in Texas should stimulate improved awareness and responses,' Wenzel said. Hospitals around the country are already getting ample opportunities to test their infection control procedures due to a growing number of false alarms. In New York, 24 patients have been put into isolation over the past eight weeks in city-owned hospitals because of fears they might have Ebola, according to Dr. Ross Wilson, the chief medical officer at the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. None had the disease (some patients had malaria and one had typhoid), but Wilson said the point has been to isolate possible cases quickly so there is no chance for the virus to spread. 'We're taking this very seriously,' he said. Safety first: Staff at Laguardia airport put on protective gloves after being given classes on dealing with Ebola . Some staff has been retrained on how to properly put on and remove protective gear. At the city's flagship public hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center, technicians are assembling a lab that will exclusively handle Ebola blood tests so that samples won't contaminate equipment in other parts of the hospital. A small number of beds have been set up in an isolation ward for taking confirmed cases. So far, nobody has had to use it. City 911 operators have been told to ask certain people calling for an ambulance whether they've been to West Africa recently. That question is also becoming the norm at AMR, which operates private ambulances in 40 states. It has told its staff of 19,000 paramedics and EMTs that patients with certain symptoms should be asked about travel to certain parts of Africa. If they answer yes, emergency service workers are supposed to don extra protective gear, including shoe coverings, a mask and goggles, and alert health authorities that the patient might have Ebola. 'We don't want to respond with a presumption that everyone in the field has Ebola,' said Dr. Ed Racht, AMR's chief medical officer. But he said extra precautions are warranted. 'The idea is, if the travel question is positive with the symptoms, it gives us a yellow flag ... It doesn't mean immediately putting on the space suits.' First U.S. victim: Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who flew to Texas, died of Ebola this week . Missed the warnings: Texas Health Presbyterian hospital failed to act when Mr Duncan first showed up exhibiting Ebola symptoms . That said, the company has also put together a guide for transporting patients who have tested positive for the virus. It includes step-by-step instructions on how to use plastic sheeting, garbage bags and duct tape to protect the ambulance and the driver from contaminants. Step No. 2: 'Place sheeting on the floor of the rig and affix to bench seat, jump seat and walls to create a bowl affect in an effort to channel any body fluids toward the center of the floor causing fluids to collect in one area.' A more commonplace precaution has popped up at the Mercer County Community Hospital in Coldwater, Ohio, a village of 4,400 people near the Indiana state boarder. Nicole Pleiman, an infection prevention and control nurse, said the hospital posted signs at entrances about a month ago telling patients to notify the staff immediately if they've traveled recently to African countries hit by the outbreak. Other hospital protocols are under review, she said. 'We will definitely revisit that to see if we need to do anything additional,' she said. Three major hospitals in Dallas have established isolation units and consulted with staff members about how to handle the next Ebola patient, if one arises. With eight children sent home from school because they had direct contact with the lone confirmed Ebola victim, Children's Memorial Hospital in northwest Dallas is preparing to treat any pediatric Ebola patients. Doctors at the other two facilities, Parkland Memorial Hospital and Baylor University Medical Center, have identified doctors and nurses ready to treat any Ebola patient. As has become commonplace nationwide, the Dallas hospitals are screening incoming patients to see if they've traveled to West Africa within the last three weeks. Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, while urging providers to be prepared, also have repeatedly said that they don't believe the country is likely to see the type of outbreak that has killed thousands of people in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Mortality rates are likely to be much lower in the U.S., due to more sophisticated care, experts say. Ebola also isn't nearly as contagious as illnesses such as the flu, which can be spread through the air, or HIV, which can be transmitted by people who have no symptoms. Still, there is concern in some quarters that not enough is being done. National Nurses United, a union that says it represents about 185,000 nurses nationwide, has been distributing a survey on Ebola preparedness to its members. Union spokesman Charles Idelson said many respondents have said they don't feel nurses at their hospital have gotten enough training about how to handle a patient who might have the virus. Many of the nurses said they weren't even aware of whether their hospital had protective gear, he said. 'It's not enough to post a link to the Centers for Disease Control on the hospital's website,' he added. Wenzel, the infectious disease specialist at Virginia Commonwealth University, said that to truly be prepared against the virus, officials may want to think beyond health care facilities. For instance, he suggested that cab drivers might be given pamphlets urging them to ask sick passengers on the way to the hospital the same question being posed now by ambulance drivers and triage nurses: Have you traveled to West Africa lately? 'I wouldn't put it in terms that are going to make people panic,' he said. But he said that, at the very least, drivers should know that cleaning up a mess left by a sick passenger could carry a health risk.","Public hospitals in NYC have been employing the tactic to make ready .

"Once known for breaking the news, Queen Letizia of Spain is now more accustomed to making it but it seems she hasn't forgotten her reporting roots. Already a patron of a number of Spanish charities dedicated to the Press, the Spanish Queen last night showed her support for the profession once again - this time by attending a journalism awards ceremony. Resplendent in a shimmering sequinned top and a neat pair of tailored trousers, the 42-year-old looked wonderful as she arrived at the Ritz Hotel for the Francisco Cerecedo journalism awards on the arm of her dapper husband King Felipe, 46. All smiles: Letizia, 42, a former journalist herself, has long been a supporter of charities dedicated to the Press . Letizia, whose father Jesús José Ortiz Álvarez and stepmother Ana Togores are both journalists, enjoyed a lengthy career in TV and newspapers before marrying Felipe in 2004. After a stint at Asturian daily paper, La Nueva España, she went on to work for ABC, a popular national newspaper that enjoys the third largest circulation in Spain. Next came a stint at Spanish news agency EFE before a move to Guadalajara in Mexico saw her take on a role on local paper, Siglo 21. Back in Spain a year later, she worked for the Spanish version of Bloomberg, a news channel and agency specialising in economics, before moving to CNN+. Support: The royal couple were visiting the Ritz Hotel in Madrid for the Francisco Cerecedo journalism awards . Former journalist: During her reporting career, Letizia worked for Bloomberg and CNN as well as Spanish TV . By the time she met her husband-to-be, Letizia was working for popular TV channel 24 Horas, where along with anchoring the popular Telediario 2 evening news bulletin, she reported on a wide range of breaking news events, among them the 2000 US presidential elections and the 9/11 attacks. Perhaps as a result of her reporting background, Letizia is one of the most enthusiastically pro-newspaper royals in Europe and regularly turns out for journalist charities and awards ceremonies. By contrast, Prince Philip is notoriously mistrustful of the media and once quipped to the matron of a Caribbean hospital he was visiting: 'You have mosquitoes. I have the Press!' When asked by Guardian journalist Polly Toynbee whether he read the paper during a Buckingham Palace reception, an affronted Prince Philip allegedly replied: 'No fear!' Family business: Letizia's father and stepmother are both well-respected journalists . Good look: Letizia was glamorous in sequins for the event and showed off a pretty plaited up-do . Dislike: Prince Philip is notoriously mistrustful of journalists and once likened the Press to mosquitoes . Privacy concerns: Prince William is extremely protective of his wife and son's privacy . Others to complain about the Press include Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - all of whom have run into difficulty with the international media. Prince William, who recently threatened a pair of photographers with legal action after they were spotted taking photos of Prince George, is fiercely protective of his - and his wife's - privacy. Although the British media has agreed to follow guidelines set by the Palace, foreign newspapers have printed a slew of controversial images, among them one taken as a gust of wind blew the Duchess' skirt up in Australia. Most notorious of all was an incident in which a French paparazzi photographer took photos of a sunbathing Duchess as she relaxed outside a secluded farmhouse from a road a mile away using a long lens. The resulting pictures, which were then published by the French version of Closer magazine in September 2012, left Prince William furious and he later took legal action against the offending photographer for invasion of privacy.","Spain's Queen Letizia joined journalists for an awards ceremony in Madrid .

"A graphic designer was left paralysed from the neck down and fighting for his life after catching a common cold. Derek Ledingham, 41, has spent the past seven months in hospital after developing the rare nerve condition Guillain-Barre syndrome. The illness, which only affects one in two million people, attacks the body's peripheral nervous system after a viral or bacterial infection such as the common cold. Graphic designer Derek Ledingham, 41, has been left paralysed  in hospital for seven months after developing the rare nerve condition Guillain-Barre syndrome . The paralysis was caused by his body overreacting to a common cold, and then attacking the nervous system. Mr Ledingham has recently managed to take his first few steps . He has only recently taken his first steps and has set his sights on being back home in Aberdeen by the end of the year. Mr Ledingham said: 'This year has been a write-off for me. 'I came into hospital and it was winter time and I'll leave in winter time.' He came down with a severe cold last New Year and was unable to shake it off for months. But after playing in a local football match in March, he woke the following day unable to move his legs. When he arrived at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for emergency treatment, doctors were initially baffled. He had the symptoms of a severe stroke, but his heart was fine. Within days he had lost control of his arms, was struggling to breathe and was transferred to intensive care, where his condition worsened until he was almost totally paralysed. It was then that specialists realised he had Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare condition where the body's immune system attacks the nervous system. The nerves become inflamed and stop working, which can lead to pain, tingling, muscle weakness, unsteadiness and lack of co-ordination. Guillain-Barre syndrome (pronounced Ghee-lan Bar-ray) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body's senses and movements. It affects about 1,500 people in the UK every year and is slightly more common in men than women. It causes the immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) to attack these nerves, causing them to become inflamed. The exact cause of GBS is unknown, but most people - around 60 per cent of sufferers - develop the condition shortly after having a viral or bacterial infection. The symptoms of GBS usually develop between one and three weeks after a minor infection. They often start in your hands and feet before spreading to your arms and legs. Initially a person suffering the condition may experience: . - pain, tingling and numbness . - progressive muscle weakness . - co-ordination problems and unsteadiness . Weakness is likely to affect both sides of the body and gets worse over several days. Around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months, and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage. Source: NHS Choices . In rare cases such as Mr Ledinghams, the muscle weakness can lead to paralysis as well as difficulty breathing and speaking. Mr Ledingham said: 'I had a cold last New Year and I couldn't shake it. 'Eventually my runny nose stopped, but I kept on coughing. I started to feel really tired every single day and couldn't place why. 'I thought I maybe just needed a good weekend to catch up on my sleep. 'On the Sunday morning it started I woke up and felt like I had a dead leg. 'It was bizarre, but I didn't think anything of it.' He went to his football team's match and pulled on his kit and played, despite feeling under the weather. The next day he woke up paralysed. He said: 'On the Monday morning I woke up and both my legs were just gone. 'On the Tuesday morning when I woke, I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't move my arms, I couldn't eat.

"More than 100million Royal Mail shares were traded within 60 minutes of the former monopoly floating on the stockmarket yesterday. Their price jumped instantly from £3.30, the sale price set by ministers, to £4.50, allowing critics to say the Government had chronically under-valued the business. The price closed at £4.55 – a 38 per cent increase on the opening price. The 378-year-old company looks set to join the FTSE index of Britain’s 100 biggest listed companies, joining household names from BP to Prudential and Vodafone to Diageo. Scroll down for video . Surge: Shares in Royal Mail soared by more than a third in early trading as the government faced claims it had under-valued the firm ahead of the controversial privatisation . Success: David Cameron, on a visit to Belfast, hailed the sell-off as a success and brushed off criticism that the firm had been under-valued . Last night, the company, which had been valued by the Government and its advisers at £3.3billion, was worth £4.4billion. While . the clampdown on small shareholders subscribing for shares was . described as ‘unwise and unfair’, it emerged that some of Britain’s . richest people tried to buy huge amounts. It is understood 41 people who asked for £1million or more of shares were among 36,500 applicants who were given nothing. Of . the 690,000 people who bought shares in the business, many had sold . within minutes of receiving them, making an instant pre-tax profit of . about £250. The . ‘unprecedented’ interest from private investors triggered meltdown at . one leading stockbroker yesterday with its website working only . intermittently because of the sheer weight of demand. Despite installing a new server to bolster its computer system, Hargreaves Lansdown said the demand was ‘off the scale’. The . number of people working on its helpline desk was increased ‘six-fold’ to handle the calls from people, most of whom wanted to sell, rather . than buy. Ian Gorham, chief executive of Hargreaves Lansdown, said the . number of shareholders wanting to trade shares had ‘gone off any . conventional scale’. Some . angry customers are understood to be demanding compensation over the . technical problems. Last night, Hargreaves Lansdown said it took all . customer complaints ‘seriously’. Steven . Fine, managing director of another broker, Peel Hunt, said he had . ‘never seen anything like it’ and described the number of people trading . Royal Mail shares as ‘extreme’. The . demand would have been even higher, but shareholders who used the . Government’s website to buy shares can not trade until their share . certificate arrives next week. Business . Secretary Vince Cable stood his ground yesterday, dismissing the sharp . jump in the share price as just ‘froth and speculation’. He said: ‘It is . of absolutely no significance whatever.’ David . Cameron also dismissed fears that the company had been sold at a . bargain price. He said: ‘First of all, we should celebrate the success . of the privatisation of this business. ‘It . is not only good for its employees, who have become shareholders, it is . not only good for the shareholders who now own this company, it is good . for the company itself. ‘As . for price, let’s see what happens in the days and weeks ahead. What . really matters is this has got off to a very good start.’ But Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘It’s a fire sale of a great institution at a knock-down price.’ Ralph Bartholomew had never bought shares in a company in his life – until this week. The 44-year-old from St Albans, Hertfordshire, who is married with two young children, said the chance to buy shares in Royal Mail seemed like too good an opportunity to miss. He said: ‘It was my first-ever foray into the stock market. ‘As far as I could tell, it was going to be difficult to lose out.’ Mr Bartholomew, who works for University College London as a web designer, tried to buy £1,500 of shares but ended up with only the minimum amount of £750. He was relaxed about not getting the full amount as he had worried that he might end up with nothing. Yesterday morning he had not made up his mind whether or not to hold his shares or to sell them. But as he watched the share price climb, he decided to sell at lunchtime. He said: ‘It shot up so much, it was too enticing to not be more than £200 richer. ‘I knew I would not regret taking the money that was on the table.’ Mr Bartholomew sold his shares, which he bought for £3.30, for £4.30, making a tidy profit of £1 each. He made £227 before trading costs. Protests: Communication Workers Union members gather outside the London Stock Exchange to protest against the floatation of the Royal Mail on the stock market . Robbery: Some protesters dressed as burglars to accuse 'fat cats' of stealing profits which should go to the taxpayer . Dr . Tim May, chief executive of the Wealth Management Association, which . campaigns for small shareholders, criticised the way that the shares . were allocated. Everybody who applied for up to £10,000 worth of stock . got at least 227 shares, but anybody who applied for £10,001 or more got . nothing. But ministers . insisted it was the fairest way of dealing with the unexpected tidal . wave of interest from private investors for a company which is one of . the best-known brands in Britain. The . scale of the interest in Royal Mail shares was eye-watering. About . £37billion, including £4billion from private investors, was chasing just . £1.7billion of shares. Row: CWU postal union boss Billy Hayes accused Business Secretary Vince Cable of making 'one of the most stupidest decisions about our postal services' The . Government triggered controversy by excluding any private investor who . had asked for more than £10,000 of shares. Instead, it gave 227 shares . to everybody who had applied for £10,000 or less, equal to about £750 . worth of shares at the original price of £3.30. Even the government was surprised by the level of interest in the privatisation of Royal Mail. More than 700,000 people applied for shares, making it seven times over-subscribed. Shares . were initially priced at between 260p and 330p, but the stampede from . investors means ministers have opted for the top price of 330p, which valued Royal Mail at around £3.3 billion. However, as shares leapt to £4.50 in early trading, the government was accused of undervaluing the firm by more than £1billion. The government is selling 52.2 per cent of the company, arguing private money is needed to ensure its future survival. Royal Mail has had to adapt to changing demands, as we post fewer letters but more parcels as we shop more online. 'Conditional share dealing', where City institutions can buy and sell the shares, begins today. Full trading will begin next Tuesday, October 15, when all investors including individual members of the public can buy and sell shares in Royal Mail. Yesterday . unions continued to bitterly oppose the privatisation, with a strike by . postal workers expected to be announced next Wednesday. Billy . Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers’ Union, said the . free shares given to workers, equal to 10 per cent of the business, had . not changed their minds. He added: ‘Shares will make no scintilla of . difference to postal workers who are far more concerned about their . jobs. We expect our members will vote to protect their terms and conditions in our strike ballot next week.’ Small . shareholders will have to wait until as late as October 21 to get their . money back if they subscribed for more shares than they actually . received. They will not . receive a penny in interest on the money, but the Government will . benefit from the interest paid on the enormous cash pile, estimated to . be £3.4billion. Mystery . surrounds the identity of City institutions who were allowed to buy . shares. Like private investors, many lost out, with 500 of the 800 who . asked for shares being rejected. Shareholders do not have to disclose . their stakes unless they own 3 per cent or more of a publicly-listed . business. In a move which . will help Royal Mail keep its investors under the radar, not a single . institution went over this threshold. Mr Cable said only ‘stable, . long-term investors’ were offered shares, with names such as Fidelity, . Standard Life, BlackRock and Threadneedle known to have been successful. David . Jones, from financial spread-betting firm IG, said it was ‘somewhat . archaic’ that so many of the shares had been sold to City institutions. Of the 522million shares sold by the Government, 33 per cent were sold . to private investors, but 67 per cent went to City institutions, such as . pension fund managers and insurance firms. He . said: ‘Based on the interest in Royal Mail, it may give the Government . pause for thought if and when they come to sell off chunks of Lloyds . Banking Group in the future. 'There is demand from individual investors . out there and maybe they should be offered a bigger piece of the pie.’","More than 700,000 people applied for shares in controversial privatisation .

"A threatened stag will be given round-the-clock protection by former soldiers to protect it from hunters. Red, an eight-year-old red deer, is one of just nine stags left on the Quantock hills in Somerset. The League Against Cruel Sports will fund the cost of protecting the animal, the Sunday Times reports. A threatened stag, called Red (pictured) will be given round-the-clock protection on the Quantock hills in Somerset by former soldiers to protect it from hunters . The red deer stag is Britain’s largest mammal and can live to be 18. They weigh up to 30 stone and are mainly concentrated in the Scottish Highlands, Dumfriesshire, Lake District, East Anglia and the south-west of England. Deer have a set of antlers which are regrown every summer, rather than permanent horns on the head. Females are often attracted to the stag with the loudest roar. Under the 1991 Deer Act, the hunting of deer is allowed only with the permission of the landowner. Several red deer stags have, however, been killed in recent years. Among them was the Monarch of New Forest, which was shot by illegal hunters trying to snatch its antlers  and the Exmoor Emperor, which is believed to have been shot by a licensed hunter in 2010. To combat this threat, security guards will patrol the area of land where Red lives with a herd of female red deer, using cameras and security equipment to monitor its location. During the current rutting season, stags are more visible than usual. The League Against Cruel Sports will fund the cost of protecting the animal in Quantock hills (pictured) Joe Duckworth, chief executive of the league told the paper: 'We own sporting rights and sanctuaries to provide safe havens for wildlife away from hunts so that animals can come and go as they please. 'Putting the lives of the animals residing there in danger will not be tolerated, which is why we have taken the decision to employ extra protection for Red.' Red was recently chased by a hound from a hunt, the organisation said. Paul Tillsley, the League’s head of investigations, said there was 'no doubt' that hunting had contributed heavily to the decline in stag numbers in the area. He said: 'Red has become a symbol of the animals that suffer prolonged and terrifying deaths as a result of the hunts that are determined to continue hunting animals in the name of sport. 'It is more than 8 years since the Hunting Act came into force, but the three red deer hunts in the West Country continue to hunt and kill deer.' There are an estimated 2million deer in Britain of which about 360,000 are red deer.","The red deer is one of just nine stags left on Quantock hills in Somerset .

"Peter Surman was found unconscious while surfing at Kuta beach . Indonesian authorities have identified the Australian man on holiday in Bali who died after collapsing while surfing as Peter Surman. The 56-year-old, from Adelaide, was found unconscious about 12.30pm on Friday at the Kuta Reef surfbreak after suffering a 'suspected medical episode', according to Adelaide Now. Lifeguards on jetskis rescued Surman and he was taken to  Bali International Medical Centre for treatment by medical staff but died two hours later. Tributes are flowing in on social media, with family, friends and the community paying their respects on Sunday. Pauline Coulson posted: 'I am so sad at the news about Peter. My heart goes out to you, Jan, Lee and of course Louise and Peter' family. I have many many childhood memories of Peter. My love prayers + thoughts to you all.' Amelia Raven posted: 'Thinking of you Grandfather. Love Nathan & Amelia. Xxxxx' Shane Ince: 'Will be sadly missed and condolences to his family at this very difficult time' Dani Mayes: 'RIP, Missing you already Pete! My thoughts are with you Louise and your family' Karen Schoneweiss: 'RIP to a lovely man - the south coast community have lost a very caring & passionate man.' Denpasar water police chief Wayan Redip said Surman had been surfing when he appeared to faint or fall unconscious suddenly. 'We can't confirm where he was surfing, because he could have floated and been carried by the waves to that position from several different Kuta surfing spots,' Redip told Fairfax Media. Police believe he may have been suffering from an already existing health condition. An Australian man, 56, from Melbourne has died after collapsing while surfing in Bali (stock image pictured) 'The beach lifeguard then evacuated the victim by jetski to the beach,' Redip told news.com.au. 'He was taken to BIMC (Bali International Medical Centre). But after two hours treated, his life can’t be saved.' The head of the Bali's lifeguard, I Made Suparka told Fairfax Media that by the time Surman was rescued, he was 'already blue, with foam coming out of his mouth and no pulse'. 'They tried to resuscitate him and he was immediately taken to the ambulance,' Suparka said. Surman worked as a business manager with Minda, a disability support organisation in South Australia. The organisation has posted a tribute to their official Facebook page on Sunday afternoon, saying: 'The Minda community is in shock at reports of the sudden passing of employee Peter Surman while on holiday in Bali. 'In his almost four years at Minda, Peter was a much-respected and valued member of staff in his role as a Business Manager and will be remembered by colleagues for his friendly and caring nature. 'A genuine and compassionate man, the aspirations, dignity and rights of the individuals Minda support were always at the forefront of Peter’s mind and he will be sorely missed. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Louise, and his family at this immensely difficult time.' The organisation has posted a tribute to their official Facebook page on Sunday afternoon . Surman and his wife Louise had been staying at a Kuta hotel for the past four days. She was not with him at the time of the incident. The family is receiving assistance from the Department of Foreign Affairs is providing consular advice to the family. Surman's body is now at Sanglah Hospital in Denpasar, which the head of Sanglah morgue said they received at 3pm.","Peter Surman was found unconscious while surfing at Kuta beach .

"The number of deliberately staged 'crash for cash' incidents are at an all time high due to scams carried out by organised gangs. Insurance companies have seen a 21 per cent increase in fraud claims so far this year compared with 2013 - and Birmingham and Greater London are the worst affected areas. Bogus claims have added £400million to motorists' insurance premiums - or about £14 for each driver, according to Britain's biggest insurer. Insurance companies have seen the number of deliberately staged 'crash for cash' incidents at an all time high . Aviva warns more than half of its motor injury claims fraud is now organised, while it currently has more than 6,500 suspicious injury claims linked to known fraud rings. Fraudsters set up an 'accident' by deliberately crashing two of their cars into each other in private or by braking in front of an innocent motorist, causing them to go into the back of their car. Sometimes the criminals will remove their brake lights to give the unsuspecting victim no warning that they need to stop in time. Over the years methods have become increasingly sophisticated, involving more than one participant, decoy vehicles and fake witnesses. Crimestoppers claims that the proceeds of organised insurance fraud is used to finance other crimes, including drug dealing, supply of illegal firearms, money laundering and people trafficking. The charity explains that a 'supply chain' exists within the gangs including drivers and middlemen to stage crashes, claimants to submit claims and professional who can be duped into helping present what looking like a genuine claim. Fraudsters either drive in front of each other and stage a crash privately or brake in front of an innocent driver . 'Criminal gangs rely upon key individuals and organisations such as recovery and storage companies, motor engineers, car repair body shops, hire car companies, doctors and solicitors – so-called ‘professional enablers',' it added. Aviva also revealed other blackspots for so-called 'accidents' include Luton, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford and Slough in Berkshire. The most notorious areas in Greater London include north and north-west London such as Uxbridge and Harrow, while fraudulent claims in Birmingham totalled more than £4.7million in August alone. Manchester had been the city with the most claims but the figure has been reduced due to the number of successful operations and prosecutions. Tom Gardiner, head of claims fraud for Aviva's UK and Ireland general insurance business, said: 'Crash for cash is not just a financial problem - it's a serious social problem. No other form of insurance fraud puts the public at risk of serious injury. Source: Crimestoppers . 'Imagine you're driving the kids to school when the car in front slams on their brakes without warning, leaving you no chance of avoiding a crash. 'These deliberate accidents are on the increase, putting innocent motorists at risk simply so the driver in front can get cash compensation. He added: 'We are asking the Government to consider compensating short-term whiplash with rehabilitation, instead of cash. 'Would crash for cash exist if there was no money in it? We don't think so.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'It’s worrying that these scams are now attracting the criminal equivalent of big business. 'Industry figures show some kind of fraudulent car insurance claim is made every nine minutes. Worryingly, cash for crash swindles don’t just have a financial cost but also risk life and limb.' In August, a 'crash for cash' leader was given a four-year prison sentence for his involvement in seven collisions across the Thames Valley and Metropolitan Police areas. Nasir Mahmood, 32,along with accomplices Aniela Chaudhry, 39, and Bernie Bautista, 43 - all from Reading - would drive two vehicles in convoy. The first vehicle would make an erratic manoeuvre, causing the second vehicle to brake suddenly and an innocent driver collide with the rear of it. Officers discovered paperwork that suggested the organisation of a further 76 collisions. Investigating officer, Det Con Russell Prentice of the Thames Valley Police Economic Crime Unit said: 'Crash for cash fraud has an impact on the safety of everyday road users when fraudsters chose to deliberately cause traffic collisions for their own financial gain.'","Insurance companies have seen a 21% increase in fraud claims this year .

"A father has told how his toddler son bit into a fruit loaf and choked on a piece of blue plastic that had been baked into it. Daniel Hall, 29, from Blackheath, south east London, said he noticed his one-year-old son, Nathan, struggling as he tucked into a slice of Marks & Spencer luxury fruit loaf. He took a closer look and said he was 'horrified' to discover that there were two large pieces of blue plastic apparently baked into the bread which his son had been chewing on. Little Nathan Hall of Blackheath, London, choked on this piece of blue plastic in his Marks & Spencer fruit loaf . Daniel Hall, 29, saw his one-year-old son struggling to eat a piece of M&S fruit loaf that had plastic in it . Mr Hall, a stay-at-home father, pulled the plastic from Nathan's mouth and called the shop to complain. He said his wife then wrote to complain, asking for a refund and for an investigation into how the plastic had ended up in the bread. Also, as instructed, she took the £1.40 loaf back to the Blackheath Simply Food branch where they had bought it. The food chain sent the couple a £10 voucher, but Mr Hall said he felt as though Marks & Spencer were fobbing them off. He told the Evening Standard: 'We wrote to M&S, complained anything could have happened, and said it is disgusting that two large pieces were found in there. They got back and sent us a letter with a £10 voucher, like it is no problem to them. 'I want a bigger gesture than that.' The Halls took the £1.40 fruit loaf back to their local Simply Food store but were angry to be given a £10 token . A spokesman for Marks & Spencer said: 'We’re sorry to hear about Mr Hall’s complaint. 'Quality is extremely important to us and we’ve been working closely with our supplier to investigate what has happened. 'We will continue to keep in touch with Mr Hall and update him on our findings.'","Daniel Hall, 29, noticed his son Nathan was struggling as he chewed bread .

"A 21-year-old Australian man is trapped overseas after an accident landed him in hospital, unable to fly home because his insurance policy was voided when the company discovered he had been drinking before the incident. Jordan Darney, from Marcoola on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, returned to his hotel room with after a night out with friends in Prague, when he stepped out of a window to smoke a cigarette and fell three storeys to the ground. Jordan suffered a broken pelvis, two broken elbows, facial lacerations and bruising, and woke with little memory of the accident but with a recorded blood alcohol level of .114%. Jordan suffered a broken pelvis, two broken elbows, facial lacerations and bruising . Jordan woke with little memory of the accident but with a recorded blood alcohol level of .114% . His family claim that his travel insurance company, Southern Cross Travel Insurance, refused to pay for medical treatment when they found out the reading, leaving Jordan stranded in a foreign country and without aid. His mother Sue flew out on the first available flight when her son called her and her husband Craig to tell them what had happened. 'Jordan rang from hospital and Sue answered and asked, 'Is dad there with you?' Craig told Daily Mail Australia. 'He told us both to sit down in a really low, horrible voice. I was assuming the worst, but then I realised that if he was ringing then he must be alright,' he said. 'After we got off the phone we broke down and tried to console each other and then it was a mad thing of 'what do we do, ring the insurance company, get some flights.' Jordan had been prepped for surgery when he was informed that his insurance company was refusing to pay the medical bills because he had been drinking. 'Sue had to max out her credit cards to get him the surgery, and since then it's cost us $6,000 a week just for him to stay in hospital,' said Craig. 'He's going to be there for at least another six or seven weeks, and I'm not sure where we're going to get the money from.' 'Money doesn't mean anything to me. If I have to live in a hut for the rest of my life, I don't care. That's why you have kids. I just want Jordan home.' In order to get Jordan home, his family need to raise the $60,000 needed to pay for a specialised medical team to assist him on a flight home. As a result of his injuries, Jordan is unable to sit up for take off or landing, and so will need to lie on a stretcher throughout the flight. His family claim that his travel insurance company, Southern Cross Travel Insurance, refused to pay for medical treatment when they found out the reading, leaving Jordan stranded in a foreign country and without aid . The family are trying to raise the $60,000 needed to fly Jordan home to be with family . Desperate to get his son home, Craig is attempting to release his superannuation early. In order to do this, he has to prove that he is experiencing significant hardship, which means getting staff from the hospital in Prague to sign a form attesting to Jordan's condition. The form needs to be translated, which is more money, before it can be looked at by the staff- and in the meantime Jordan is languishing in the hospital with only his mum by his side. 'It's like drawing blood,' Craig said. 'I know there are processes and I understand that, but it takes time and we don't have time.' 'When he went in for the operation I said to Sue that I wished it was me, and not him. I don't think there's anything wrong with the hospital, but who wants their son half a world away?' Craig is juggling running the Surf Club apartments which he and his wife manage with supporting his family long distance and frantically trying to raise the money they need to come home. 'I know there will be some people out there saying, what a drop kick, he was drunk, but he'd blown the equivalent of three glasses of wine.' 'The thing I keep saying is that it could be anyone's kid, which is scary'. Local Hannah Chapman, who knows the family well and started the fundraising page for Jordan, said that she couldn't believe that the policy was void simply because he'd had a few drinks. 'Jordan is such a vivacious and bubbly person, a really out there character,' said local Hannah Chapman . 'Everyone in the town knows him, he's been the local barista since he was 15, has made everyone their coffee,' Hannah said . 'I did the whole Europe thing, I did so many stupid things, and I had no idea that if something had happened to me I would have been in the same situation. 'This could happen to anyone. How many people travel and think they'll be covered, and how many parents aren't aware that their children might not have access to the medical help they need?' 'The family has already spent more than $20,000, where are they meant to get the rest?' Southern Cross Travel Insurance have been contacted for confirmation of their policy details, something which Craig has quizzed them on. 'I posed a hypothetical question to them, and asked that if I was overseas and shared a bottle of wine with my wife, and looked one way before crossing but forgot to look the other, and was hit by a car, would I be covered?' he said. 'They couldn't answer me. But that's the same level alcohol as Jordan. I just don't know what the world is coming to.' The Darney's are hoping to raise the funds they need to bring Jordan home through the their crowdfunding page. 'The response has been amazing, and everyone has been so supportive,' said Hannah. 'I think it's because Jordan is such a vivacious and bubbly person, a really out there character.' 'Everyone in the town knows him, he's been the local barista since he was 15, has made everyone their coffee,' Hannah said. 'He's very well loved in our tight-knit community. We just want him home for Christmas.'

"Inventions from the Wright brother’s flying machine to Apple's iPod are some of the most instantly recognisable in the world and define entire eras. Now a group of artists have sourced the patents for the game-changing gadgets and recreated their designs in a collection of stylish blueprints to celebrate the iconic designs. They include inventions as simple as the Lego brick and other more complex designs, such as the first typewriter or a Harley Davidson motorcycle. A group of artists have sourced the patents for iconic objects and recreated their designs in a collection of stylish blueprints. They include the print for Nintendo's Game Boy (pictured) which together with the later Game Boy Colour, sold almost 119 million units across the world . The designs were the idea of the Florida-based art company Oliver Gal Artist Co, whose works feature not only the intricate designs of the objects, but also the history behind each. The company hopes that in a world where inventions that are becoming ever more complex, the images will stand as a reminder of the thinking that went into each of the classic designs. The reworked blueprints include some of our favourite toys such as the Lego brick, which was awarded it’s for U.S. patent for a ‘toy building brick’ in 1961 – and has now expired – meaning that anyone can copy it. Another design featuring in the series includes the first iPod, which was released on October 23, 2001, just over eight months after iTunes was released. It had just 5GB of storage and because it was expensive and only compatible with Macs, sales were pretty slow until 2004 . World-changing inventions such as the gun and first flying machine are also included in the series of blueprints. One of them (pictured) shows the firing mechanism of the revolver handgun, which was patented on December 6, 1881 . Since the Danish company began making its interlocking bricks in 1949, around 560 billion have been produced. The blueprints also feature another childhood favourite - the Slinky - which was patented in 1947. The toy was invented by naval engineer Richard James in 1943 and was a sell-out hit when it launched for $1 two years later. In 60 years it has sold over 300 million units and has been used as a toy, teaching tool, wartime radio antenna and even as a physics experiment by Nasa. Blueprints of the Rubik’s Cube go some way as to explain its fiendish difficulty to solve. In a classic Rubik’s Cube each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers in white, red, blue, yellow, green and orange and an internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently to mix up the colours. The way we listen to music has changed dramatically over the decades. A re-designed blueprint for the phonograph record is pictured left, and another for the tape - a symbol of the 1980s - is pictured on the right, showing its intricate method of feeding film between rollers . The retractable ballpoint pen is pictured. Ballpoint pens have been around since 1888 and dispense a viscous ink from an internal reservoir through the rolling action of a metal ball at its point. The mechanism was originally developed as a cleaner and reliable alternative to fountain pens and millions are manufactured and sold every day . Sewing machines were invented during the first Industrial Revolution to decrease the amount of manual sewing work performed in clothing companies. Since the invention of the first working sewing machine, generally considered to have been the work of Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790, there have been many designs, including the Wheeler & Dial model (pictured left).  The classic and intricate design of the typewriter is pictured on the right . World-changing inventions such as the gun and first flying machine are also included in the series of blueprints. One of them shows the firing mechanism of the revolver handgun, which was patented on December 6, 1881. The ingenious structure of the Wright brothers’ flying machine was patented in 1906 by the two American aviation pioneers who built the world’s first successful airplane and made the first controlled and powered human flight in a machine heavier than air, in 1903. The Slinky was patented in 1947 and was invented by naval engineer Richard James in 1943. It was a sell-out hit when it launched for $1 two years later. In 60 years it has sold over 300million units and has been used as a toy, teaching tool, wartime radio antenna and even as a physics experiment by Nasa . Photographic viewfinder apparatus by H.A. Bing is included in the collection of re-worked blueprints, (pictured left) along with the design for a compact camera with a zoom, which was awarded a patent in 1932, pictured right, - despite looking more modern than the 1960s design on the left . Blueprints of the Rubik's Cube (pictured) go some way as to explain its fiendish difficulty to solve. In a classic Rubik's Cube each of the six faces is covered by nine stickers in white, red, blue, yellow, green and orange and an internal pivot mechanism enables each face to turn independently to mix up the colours . It is easy to forget that items we take for granted, like the tennis racket, were invented and designed by someone. The method for stringing the racket (pictured left) was patented in 1907 and the design of boxing gloves (pictured right) was patented in 1923 . In more modern times, objects such as the vinyl record, the iPod and Nintendo Game Boy are easily recognisable and are part of the series of artwork based on their original blueprints. The U.S. patent for Nintendo’s Game Boy was awarded in 1993. It was Nintendo’s second held-held games console and together with the Game Boy Colour, sold almost 119million units across the world. The console has been a huge success since its launch, when it sold its entire shipment in the U.S. within a few weeks. One of the most recognisable guitars in the world, the Gibson Les Paul is a solid body electric guitar that was first sold in 1952. Versions of the famous model have been played by guitar legends including Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townsend, Jimmy Page, Slash and Eric Clapton. A patent of the boom box, which became a must-have of the 1980s and 1990s, is pictured right . The re-worked blueprints include some of our favourite toys such as the Lego brick, which was awarded it's for U.S. patent for a 'toy building brick' in 1961 - and has now expired - meaning that anyone can copy it . While CDs were not widely adapted until the late 1980s, and became the main music format in the 1990s, a patent for the technology (pictured left) was filed in 1960. A patent for the forward lean adjuster mechanism for ski boots is pictured on the right . The iPod might have spawned a hundred imitations, but the original AppleMP3 player was patented as recently as 2008. The first iPod was released on October 23, 2001, just over eight months after iTunes was released with 5GB of storage but because it was expensive and only compatible with Macs, sales were pretty slow until 2004. Since then there have been six generations of iPod, the largest of which has 160GB of storage, as well as more compact iPod Minis, Nanos and Shuffles and the iPod Touch, which has a touch screen much like the iPhone. Berliner Gramophone was an early record label, the first company to produce disc 'gramophone records' pictured playing on this intricate gramophone (left) and a version of the 1887 blueprint for an old camera pictured right . The ingenious structure of the Wright brothers' flying machine (pictured) was patented in 1906 by the two American aviation pioneers who built the world's first successful airplane and made the first controlled and powered human flight in a machine heavier than air, in 1903 . There have been many tweaks to bicycle design over the years, but this blueprint of the velocipede (pictured left), patented in 1890 still has classic appeal. The yo-yo was patented in 1866 and was first made popular in the 1920s but it was first invented in ancient Greece . Harley Davidson Inc was founded in the first decade of the 20th century and was one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression. The motorcycles (pictured) are known for the tradition of heavy customisation that gave rise to the 'chopper' style of motorcycle . It is hard to believe that Apple's first personal compute, which was patented in 1983, (pictured left) led to the development of the company's super slim offerings like the iPad and MacBook Air today.  The blueprint for an elaborate cash register with beautiful art nouveau style detailing is pictured on the right .","The designs were the idea of the Florida-based art company Oliver Gal Artist Co, whose works feature not the intricate designs of the objects and their history .

BJP leader Satish Upadhayay and Shazia Ilmi both armed themselves with brooms to take part in the cleaning outside the India Islamic Centre in the country's capital city. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Swachh Bharat national cleanliness campaign on October 2 this year by grabbing a broom and cleaning the road himself. According to the Times of India, it is the country's biggest ever cleanliness drive and at least three million central government employees will be working nationwide on the campaign. The prime minister has set the ambitious target of complete sanitation in the next five years, which includes getting rid of open defecation and improved management of both solid and liquid waste.

"A 21-year-old unemployed man has become an internet sensation after he recorded an All About That Bass spoof in his little sister's bedroom, singing about his love for cakes. Tyler Moffat decided to produce the video All About the Cakes, singing about his love for the sweet treats and chicken thighs, as he dances in front of the camera. The video has become an internet hit after it was watched more than a million times on Facebook and 20,000 times on YouTube. Mr Moffat, who did not expect the three minute video to become so popular, includes comic lines such as: 'Every part of me is jelly from the bottom to the top.' Scroll down for video . Tyler Moffat recorded the spoof video 'for a laugh' and never expected it to become such a hit on the internet . Mr Moffat, 21, dances throughout his three minute spoof of All About That Bass posted on Youtube . He also says: 'Yeah, its pretty clear I eat a cake or two but if I’m really hungry it could be 22.' 'It's absolutely nuts how much attention it has got,' Mr Moffat told MailOnline. 'I never ever expected it to be like that.' He dances throughout the video, with a lipstick kiss mark on his neck, and looks to his friend laughing. He added: 'I just made the video for a laugh because I was bored. I put it on Facebook and it got a million views, and I thought, are you kidding me? It feels like a lifetime achievement.' Some of the lyrics see Mr Moffat dissolve in laughter, particularly as he sings the chorus 'Mama told me not to worry about my thighs. The 21 year old Scot said he was surprised when lines that he sang during the video rhymed . Mr Moffat would like to be a comedian and said one of his greatest ambitions was to appear on Big Brother . 'She said if you are still hungry go down and make yourself some chicken fries.' It also has a typically comic end as the music apparently stops, leaving Mr Moffat to explain what would have been his finale to the camera, before he eats a cake. Mr Moffat, who has been making comic videos since he was 16, has been caring for his mother, who has rheumatoid arthritis and sciatica for the last couple of years. 'I'm all about the cakes, about the cakes, the cakes, no trifle, I'm all about the cakes . Yeah, it's very clear I can eat a cake or two but if I'm really hungry I might eat 22. I got the boom boom and all the shots, all the right s*** in all the right places. I see that Burger King working up all those shops. I know that food they make, try and make it stop. You got booty booty, just make it stop. Every burger that you give me, I will try and stuff them up. Mama told me don't worry about my thighs. She said if you are still hungry go downstairs and make yourself some fries. No, I won't be no stick figure, won't eat no salad bowls. So if that's what you are offering then I will get you f****** told. Because you know it's about my thighs, about my thighs (repeats) I'm bringing brownies back, go ahead and tell those skinny b****** that. So you think you're fat? Every part of me is jelly from the bottom to the top . Mama she told me don't worry about your size. She said go down the shop and buy yourself some chicken thighs. No, I won't be no stick figure, or silicone barbie doll. So if that's what you want, go ahead, move. Because you know it's all about the cakes, about the cakes, no trifle (repeat) [music stops] . The finale was going to be a nice sweet cake for myself. F*** it. Eat cakes you all.' He added: 'She doesn't want to have home help and is more comfortable if I'm here with her. So I'm often here, there and everywhere on the way back and forth to hospital appointments.' The video is a spoof of Meghan Trainor's video All About That Bass, which includes the line 'Mama told me not to worry about my size.' It has been liked thousands of times since Mr Moffat uploaded it on YouTube on September 24. He said he would like to become a professional comedian but was unsure how to achieve it. He said he has also been the victim of internet trolls which used to affect him, but following the success of the video he feels he can stand up to them. He added: 'I've had trolls on Facebook for years. I've had to learn to ignore it. If they are talking about me at least they are leaving someone else alone. 'I would love to do something to do with comedy in the future and I would love to go on Big Brother. My whole family love it. But I can't because I'm here for my mum.'","Tyler Moffat, 21, recorded 'All About the Cakes' in his sister's old bedroom .

"The estranged wife of embattled actor Stephen Collins has taken him to task for starring in a new short film about a pedophile priest, it was revealed today. Collins, 67, who is being investigated for allegedly molesting three girls in the 1970s and 80s, appeared in Jeff Wolfe's 11-minute short titled Penance, which was filmed last year and premiered in March. The movie follows David Lyons as a tormented man who visit Collins' pedophile priest to ‘clear his conscience and discover exactly what it means to find forgiveness...or give it.’ Scroll down for video . Under fire: Actor Stephen Collins has found himself embroiled in a child abuse scandal centering around his alleged confession . Art imitating life: A year before the allegations against Collins came to light, he starred in a short film titled Penance playing a pedophile priest . Award-winning flick: The 11-minute movie premiered in March and won a prize for Best Narrative Short at the Los Angeles International Underground Film Festival . In one cringe-inducing moment in the film, Collins is seen looking at school pictures of young children. Wolfe's independent flick was shown at the Catalina Film Festival on September 27, less than two weeks before TMZ released an audio recording in which a man believed to be Collins could be heard confessing to molesting three girls, among them a young relative, during a couple's therapy session. According to the gossip site, two weeks after the film's debut, Faye Grant sent her husband a sternly-worded email titled 'IS THIS SOME SORT OF JOKE?' blasting him for taking on the role of the perverted clergyman. ‘You sexually molested a child using your role as a minister to engender trust. YOU ARE BEGGING TO BE INCARCERATED, STEPHEN,’ Grant reportedly wrote. The actor’s wife had previously accused the TV star of using his best-known role as a pastor on the long-running show 7th Heaven to gain the trust of a couple whose child he later allegedly molested. In an interview about the film given in April, Collins described the experience playing the fallen clergyman as 'very  intense' Creepy: At one point in the film, Collins' priest looks at school photos of children (pictured) Confrontation: Collins starred in Penance opposite David Lyons (left) as a tormented man who visit the pedophile priest to face off against his demons . Jeff Wolfe, the Emmy Award-winning stunt coordinator who directed Penance, told TMZ he knew nothing about Collins' alleged exploits when he tapped him for the role. In another interview with People Magazine, the filmmaker stated: ‘I found the recent allegations particularly shocking, as my film is meant to speak to victims of abuse and the idea that the effects of abuse never really go away.’ Wolfe has vowed to donate all the proceeds from the film to the James Storehouse Foundation - a non-profit organization dedicated to helping abused children. Speaking to entertainment website Nerdacy at WonderCon in April 2014, Stephen Collins called the experience of playing a priest in Wolfe’s film ‘very intense,’ Us Magazine reported. ‘We got a chance to do something so different from what we do,’ he gushed. ‘It's probably going to be in a bunch of festivals next year. It's very intense, very quiet in a different way.’ According to a Facebook page dedicated to Penance, the flick, which won a prize for Best Narrative Short at the Los Angeles International Underground Film Festival, has been pulled from two movie showcases in Denver and San Jose. Wife's wrath: Collins' wife Faye Grant (left) allegedly sent Collins, who also played a priest on 7th Heaven for many years (right), a stern email excoriating him for taking on the role of a pedophile cleric in Penance . Small-screen star: Collins is best known for his role as the pastor dad on '7th Heaven' series. Here the actor is pictured with his TV family in 1999 . Ron Truppa, director of the Catalina Festival, told Inside Edition that the bombshell revelations about Collins left everyone stunned. ‘It's just one of those things that are really uncanny, when art imitates life like that,’ he said in a recent interview. Collins has not been charged with any crime, but after the release of the taped confession last week he was dropped from the upcoming comedy Ted 2 and the drama series Scandal.","Collins, 67, appeared in Jeff Wolfe's award-winning 11-minute short Penance, which was filmed in 2013 .

"An extra £100million will be made available for homeowners to get cheap new boilers and double glazing, the Lib Dems announced today. The extra money will allow more families to apply for grants of  around £8,000 to improve their home’s energy efficiency. Those who have moved home in the past year, meanwhile, are likely to get up to £500 under the ‘Green Deal Home Improvement Fund’ - although the exact details are yet to be agreed. The big six energy firms have also been ordered to slash the time it takes for people to switch to cheaper rivals, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said today. Scroll down for video . Energy Secretary Ed Davey announced an extra £100million would be made available for families to get cheaper boilers . Mr Davey, speaking to the Lib Dem conference in Glasgow today, said the moves were designed to ‘deliver cheaper greener energy’. He also confirmed plans  for families to get £100 off their council tax bill if they make their property more energy efficient and told delegates that the Lib Dems would seek to bring in laws to ban coal being used to generate electricity from 2025 should they be in government after next year's general election. But Mr Davey's set piece announcement was the £100million boost to the Green Deal. He said: ‘Today I can announce an extra one hundred million pounds to help people cut their energy bills. ‘We will extend the Green Deal Home Improvement Fund that proved so popular earlier this year. New boilers. Double glazing. Better insulation. So people can permanently cut their bills.’ Replacing an inefficient boiler and insulating cavity walls costs about £4,000, with an average energy bill saving of £200 to £300 a year. Solid wall insulation costs between £5,000 and £10,000, but can save households up to £400 a year on heating bills. Insulating a loft and installing solar panels costs £6,000 and saves about £200 a year. Mr Davey claimed the energy market was in a ‘real mess’ under Labour. He said: ‘Ed Miliband, Labour’s last energy minister, left an energy market dominated by the “Big 6”, with over 99 per cent market share. ‘Miliband had refused to take on these big business interests. Miliband was happy with Labour’s Big six. ‘Well, Liberal Democrats weren’t. We could see the dangers to people’s energy bills from Labour’s weak approach to energy competition. After all, fuel poverty had rocketed under Labour. ‘So we set out to grow new competitors to Labour’s Big 6. To make it easier and quicker for people to switch their energy supplier. ‘And it’s worked. We’ve nearly trebled the number of smaller firms. Two million people have switched from Labour’s big 6. ‘And prices are now being frozen – or better, in many cases, cut. And despite that success, I want to go much further. ‘That’s why I support the first ever independent review of Britain’s energy markets – a review Ed Miliband rejected three times when he was doing my job. ‘That’s why I can announce today that I am delivering on my promise to halve switching times this year. Every major energy firm is on schedule to deliver the faster switching I have demanded.’ The Lib Dems want more onshore wind farm turbines - like this one next to the coal fired Drax Power Station at Selby, North Yorkshire . Mr Davey attacked the Tories for wanting to ‘frack every square mile of Britain’ – but warned activists that the ‘real enemy’ was not shale gas but coal. He said: ‘Coal is the climate destroyer. That’s why I’m pleased to announce that if the Liberal Democrats are in government after the election, we will legislate to ban the generation of electricity from coal from 2025. ‘But renewables cannot quickly replace all of the electricity we currently get from coal without carbon, capture and storage. We will need gas, as a bridge to a zero fossil fuel future, at least for the next two or three decades. That’s reality. ‘And I’d far rather use Britain’s gas, than Putin’s gas. Or even Middle East gas. ‘Our own gas is much more secure. And, thanks to our tougher environmental regulations, and not having to ship it round the world, our own gas is better for the climate. ‘As North Sea gas production falls, we simply cannot afford to turn our back on our own, home grown gas supplies. ‘But I have had to hold back the Tories’ desire to frack every square mile of Britain. Ensuring that gas exploration is safe. Protecting our national parks, areas of outstanding beauty and world heritage sites. Stopping a Tory free-for-all on fracking.’","Families can apply for around £8,000 to improve home’s energy efficiency .

"The North-South divide in property prices has widened in the six years since the financial crisis began. While homes in London have increased in value by almost 50 per cent, those in swathes of England and Wales are still worth less than they were before the recession. But the chance of those prices recovering is receding, with further evidence that the market across the country is beginning to slow. Property prices in London have soared since the recession while the north has seen stagnation . Property values in the West Midlands, East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, North West and Wales have still not reached pre-crisis levels, LSL Property Services claims. But prices in London have soared by 47.3 per cent over the same period, with the average home jumping from £392,629 at the previous peak in February 2008, to £578,377 in September. If Greater London and the South East are excluded, average house prices across England and Wales grew at just 4.5 per cent. If they are included, they grew at 10.6 per cent. The figures highlight the stark North/South divide among UK homeowners, and come amid further evidence that the property market across the country is beginning to slow. David Newnes, director of Reeds Rains and Your Move estate agents – part of LSL Property Services – said: ‘For six years regions of the UK, average property prices achieved on completion are yet to match their pre-crisis score – and a North/South divide in the field remains evident in the race back from the debris of the financial crash.’ The south west in September became just the fourth region in the UK to ‘scramble out from under the shadow of the financial crisis’, says the report - after London, the South East and East Anglia. The sobering evidence of the mixed fortunes of homeowners in different parts of the country comes amid fresh evidence that the recovery in the housing market has started to fizzle out. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has described 'excessive household debt' as a major economic risk . The Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday revealed that lending dropped 8pc to £18.1billion in August, compared with £19.1billion in July – although lending is up 9pc over the year. Separate figures released by the Bank of England earlier this week showed that lenders reported the biggest fall in credit they were able to supply since the last three months of 2008, when Lehman Brothers collapsed. It attributed this to stricter lending rules introduced in April, as well as concerns about the outlook for house prices. But it said mortgage lending is likely to pick up again in the remainder of the year. Experts have said fears of an imminent hike in interest rates have also poured cold water on the property market as people have become more nervous about buying a house or remortgaging. According to the Bank, mortgage lending in August fell to a three-month low, and major mortgage lender Nationwide has reported that house prices fell in September, the first month-on-month drop in 17 months. Paul Smee, director general of the CML, commented: ‘The lending climate had a glass half full, glass half empty feel about it in August. Overall, these figures give no support to any fears of a developing bubble in housing.’ Bank of England governor Mark Carney has decribed excessive household debt as the ‘greatest risk to the domestic economy’ and has introduced measures to restrict big home loans.

"In a painful reminder of the tsunami that left a trail of destruction in Japan, devastating flooding has caused 28 deaths and forced around 250,000 people in the south-west of the country to flee their homes. Most were able to return home today, although the danger from record rainfall has not fully passed, with more downpours possible later. Thousands of homes and hundreds of roads were damaged, and hundreds of landslides were reported. Wreckage: Rescue workers search for missing people at the scene of a landslide in Aso, Kumamoto prefecture . Suffering: A sick elderly woman is carried on a stretcher be airlifted to a hospital in Yame, south-west Japan . The military has airlifted food by helicopter to stranded districts. News reports said 28 people have died and police were searching for four missing people in the three prefectures of Kumamoto, Oita and Fukuoka, after heavy rainfall that began on Thursday. Nationwide tallies of the dead and missing are not immediately available. Weather officials warned people to be careful even in areas where rain had subsided because the land was still mushy and prone to landslides. Even as some of the water subsided, homes and farms on the southern island of Kyushu, hardest hit by the flooding, were still getting food shipments, although mostly by land, local officials said.

"Miranda Lambert has reached new heights as a female country performer: The fiery singer is the most decorated female artist in the 47-year history of the Country Music Association Awards. Lambert's four wins on Wednesday night give the 30-year-old a total of 11 CMA trophies throughout her career, putting her ahead of any other female act. Lambert's fifth consecutive win for female vocalist of the year Wednesday beat a record set by herself, Reba McEntire and Martina McBride. Scroll down for video . Queen of the night: On Wednesday night Miranda Lambert took over the CMA awards in Nashville, Tennessee as she won in her three most important categories . Lambert also took home album of the year for Platinum, single of the year for Automatic' and music event of the year for We Were Us with Keith Urban. 'It's really unbelievable,' she said backstage. 'I felt like this whole night was about really celebrating music.' Lambert lost the night's top award to Luke Bryan, giving the 38-year-old his first CMA. The win for entertainer of the year marked a shift in the genre, which has shunned the party-boy singer who is the leader of the contemporary pack of bro-country performers, which includes acts like Florida Georgia Line. 'I have longed and sought after to get one of these in my hands. ... To get the respect of the CMA board ... is a ginormous deal,' a happy Bryan said backstage. 'I am really humbled. I think about the hard work it took to get here. I am so blessed this is from the CMAs and I will never take it for granted.'

Bryan beat out George Strait, Blake Shelton and Urban for entertainer of the year, and his successful year included the top-selling album 'Crash My Party,' a string of hit songs and a top-grossing tour. Bryan also was named last year's entertainer of the year at the Academy of Country Music Awards. He was snubbed when the Grammy Awards revealed their nominees last year, but his CMA win could help him earn some love from the Recording Academy when it announces its nominations next month. Lambert, too, could be bringing home some Grammy gold since she was the reigning queen of Wednesday's awards show. She stole the night with fashion choices that were winners, too, and performances. She sang twice onstage, including a country-tinged version of All About That Bass with breakthrough singer Meghan Trainor, where Shelton looked up and bopped his head.

The theme of the CMAs seemed to be paired performances: Shelton sang with Ashley Monroe; the Doobie Brothers performed with Lady Antebellum's Hillary Scott, Jennifer Nettles and Hunter Hayes; Strait and Eric Church performed 'Cowboys Like Us'; and pop diva Ariana Grande sported a mini top and skirt as she sang the hit Bang Bang alongside Little Big Town, who won vocal group of the year. But the night's best collaboration was pregnant Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley. The white-hot duo, hosting the CMAs for a seventh time, earned laugh after laugh for jokes that ranged from Ebola to Taylor Swift to Underwood's baby bump. Swift's switch to pop from country was referred to as Postpartum Taylor Swift Disorder, or PPTSD. Big set: The duo sang up a storm onstage . His turn: Kenny Chesney had a hippie vibe for his number . Presenting: Steven Tyler turned from rocker to host at the CMAs . 'President Barack Obama doesn't care about PPTSD!' Paisley yelled. Underwood followed with: 'I'm pretty sure it's why the Democrats lost the Senate.' Underwood and Paisley sang a version of Dolly Parton's Jolene, calling it Quarantine.' Paisley also earned roaring laughter when he noted that the ABC series Black-ish, which airs Wednesdays, would not be airing because of the CMAs. 'If you were expecting to see the show `Black-ish,' this ain't it ... I hope you're enjoying `White-ish,'' he said. But the biggest bomb Underwood dropped on Wednesday night was a few hints regarding the sex of her unborn baby. As she bantered with her co-host Brad Paisley, the two discussed whether she is expecting a boy or a girl. Their turn: Hillary Scott, Charles Kelley, and Dave Haywood perform during the 48th annual CMA Awards . All that glitters: Kimberly Perry wore a sequinned number as she performed with The Band Perry . Singing with a legend: Kasey Musgrave got a smooch after performing with Loretta Lynn . After Brad pressed her, she whispered in his ear, prompting the proud declaration: 'I know something you all don't know. Suck it TMZ!' Later, however, he appeared to let slip his newly acquired secret. The pair were discussing Garth Brooks presenting duties that night when Paisley blurted out that Carrie could name her child after Garth. 'What are you doing,' Carrie, 31, quipped. 'Well, you kept that secret for a whole two minutes.' Winner, winner: Kasey won for song of the year . Singing out: Keith Urban got the crowd going as he riffed on his electric guitar . Debut: Brett Eldredge won for New Artist Of The Year . Of course it could all be a part of their schtick, but it appeared to be an admission that the country star is expecting a boy with husband Mike Fisher. Kacey Musgraves, meanwhile, who won two Grammy Awards earlier this year, won song of the year for Follow Your Arrow, which she co-wrote with Brandy Clark, who is openly gay and was among the contenders for new artist of the year. Follow Your Arrow features the lyrics, 'So make lots of noise, kiss lots of boys, or kiss lots of girls, if that's something you're into.' She's electric: Ariana Grande lit up the stage for a performance midway through the night . Beautiful presenters: Martina McBride and Connie Britton handed out an award . Winners: Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard won for best vocal duo . 'For a song that I was told could never, and would never, be a single, it just blows my mind,' Musgraves said. 'It's just an anthem for all kinds of people so I could not be more proud.' Musgraves switched gears backstage, closing with a story about a malfunction before her performance Wednesday night. 'Just so y'all now, my panties totally came off,' she said as reporters laughed. 'They were the stick-on kind. Look at this dress, there's not much to work with.' Harmonizing: Jimi Westbrook and Kimberly Schlapman of Little Big Town, Ariana Grande, and Karen Fairchild and Phillip Sweet of Little Big Town perform onstage .

"Internet shoppers could soon be hit with a new sales tax, making online purchases up to 11 per cent more expensive. Congress is considering new legislation that would allow states to force sales tax on internet purchases, which would help make up states' budget shortfalls. Meanwhile Amazon, the world's largest internet retailer, is making deals with individual states to collect sales taxes regardless of what Congress decides. New tax: Internet shoppers are likely to be hit with a new sales-tax as the proposal boasts strong support from both Democrat and Republican senators . Currently, online shoppers enjoy a 5 to . 10 per cent ‘discount’ thanks to no sales-tax, which is implemented on . goods brought at bricks-and-mortar stores. If the new legislation – the Marketplace Fairness Act – is passed, states could potentially rake in $23 billion each from online sales tax collections, burgeoning their financial health. An LG high-definition TV costing $560 on online retailer Overstock.com will cost internet shoppers varying amounts depending on their states' sales tax. The TV will cost: . $602 in Florida (sales tax - 7.5%) $620.48 in California (sales tax - 10.8%) $609.84 in New York (sales tax - 8.9%) $588 in Maine (sales tax - 5%) $624.40 in Illinois (sales tax - 11.5%) Internet retailers could have to pay . sales taxes to any state from which an Internet user placed an order, . even if the company is entirely located in other states. The amount of sales tax applied to online goods will vary according to individual state’s tax codes and sales tax rates, which range from less than 1 per cent to more than 10 per cent. The internet sales tax in each state will be set at the same amount as the state's sales tax. Due to the different rates, New Yorkers will pay about $1.8 billion more while Californians will shell out $4.2 billion. The average U.S. online shopper will soon be spending $1,700 annually so the new tax will cost each person approximately $125 every year, according to Forrester Research, reported NBC news. Costly: The average U.S. online shopper will soon be spending $1,700 annually so the new tax will cost each person approximately $125 every year . As supporters of the legislation have keenly pointed out, adding a sales tax to online purchases will balance out the playing field for retailers where internet shopping has threatened or killed off smaller, independent bricks-and-mortar stores. The Marketplace Fairness Act would require online retailers to collect and pay sales taxes to states even where they have no physical presence. This list of State's sales taxes, from lowest to highest, includes any local surtaxes. Delaware 0%New Hampshire 0%Oregon 0%Montana 3% general sales tax = 0%, a few surtaxes apply at 3%Hawaii 4.7%Maine 5%North Dakota 5%Virginia 5%Wisconsin 5.6%Arkansas 6%Connecticut 6%D.C. 6.0%Idaho 6%Kentucky 6%Maryland 6%Michigan 6%South Dakota 6%West Virginia 6%Massachusetts 6.3%Alaska 7%Iowa 7%Nebraska 7%New Jersey 7%Rhode Island 7%Vermont 7%Wyoming 7%Florida 7.5%Ohio 7.8%Minnesota 7.8%Colorado 8.0%Georgia 8%Pennsylvania 8%Nevada 8.1%North Carolina 8.3%Texas 8.3%Utah 8.4%Oklahoma 8.5%New Mexico 8.6%Kansas 8.7%New York 8.9%Indiana 9%Louisiana 9%Mississippi 9%South Carolina 9%Missouri 9.2%Washington 9.5%Tennessee 9.8%Alabama 10%Arizona 10.6%California 10.8%Illinois 11.5% . Source: Tax Foundation . In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that retailers can only collect taxes in states where they have a physical presence. The internet sales tax proposal, which boasts bipartisan support, has gained momentum recently with a Senate hearing on Wednesday. Amazon's vice president Paul Misener came out in support of the bill on Wednesday night as the world’s largest internet retailer gradually adds sales taxes across the nation. Amazon is establishing a physical presence in more states by building warehouses. This physical presence means Amazon customers will be charged with sales tax regardless of whether new legislation is passed so the company has less reason to fight internet sales tax, as it used to. Texans have already starting paying it and, in September, Californian residents will also be taxed. By next year, ten states will be taxed, reported NBC. Furthermore, because internet retailers will potentially have to spend time and resources complying to different state’s tax codes they may well rise the prices of goods to cover this extra work. Although consumers  presently do not pay a sales tax on online purchases they are meant to pay a ‘use tax’ later to the state. However, . hardly anyone knows about or pays this ‘use tax’, which is set at the . same rate as the state’s sales tax, and it is rarely enforced. This . ‘use tax’ means supporters of the proposal can argue that the . legislation allows for collection of money the state is already owed. The . onus on paying the tax is transferred from the customer to the retailer . where the businesses would have to file a tax return for every state . they sell in and could be subject to audits in those states.","Congress considering new Marketplace Fairness Act to allow states to force tax on internet sales .

"Few taxpayers know they're expected to pay sales tax on online purchases, so a new law likely to pass in Congress Monday will help states force retailers to pay up, thus forcing the retailer to charge its customers tax. The Senate is expected to pass a bill Monday making it easier for states to collect sales taxes for online purchases. Some of the nation's largest retailers are rejoicing. But small-business owners who make their living selling products on the Internet worry they will be swamped by new requirements from faraway states. Scroll down for video . Cheats: Internet retailers like Sarah Davis are supposed to collect sales tax and shoppers are supposed to pay it even if they don't, but states have trouble enforcing the laws few follow . ‘It's a huge burden for a company like ours,’ said Sarah Davis, co-owner of Fashionphile.com, a California-based company that sells high-end pre-owned handbags and purses. ‘We don't have an accounting department, we've got my father-in-law.’ Davis started the company in 1999 and now runs it with her brother-in-law. They have 26 workers and three stores, in Beverly Hills, San Diego and San Francisco. Last year, Fashionphile.com did $10 million in sales, the vast majority of it online, Davis said. Fashionphile.com sells bags directly from its website and on eBay. The company collects sales taxes from customers who live in California, but not from people who live in other states, Davis said. Under the law, states can only require stores to collect sales taxes if the store has a physical presence in the state. That means big retailers, such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target, with stores all over the country collect sales taxes when they sell goods over the Internet. But eBay, Amazon and other online retailers don't have to collect sales taxes, except in states where they have offices or distribution centers. As a result, many online sales are essentially tax-free, giving Internet retailers an advantage over brick-and-mortar stores. Worry: Small e-commerce retailers like Davis and Ben Hemmnger worry how they'll cope with a new law regarding online sales tax due to pass Monday . But the purchases aren't really tax free under the law. In states with sales taxes, if you buy something from an out-of-state retailer and don't pay taxes, you are supposed to pay those taxes when you file your state tax return, said Neal Osten, director the Washington office of the National Conference of State Legislatures. Only Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon have no sales tax. Alaska has no state sales tax but does have local ones. Unpaid sales taxes are usually referred to as ‘use taxes’ on state income tax returns. Use taxes apply to purchases made over Internet, from catalogs, television and radio ads and purchases made directly from out-of-state companies. State officials, however, complain that few people pay these taxes, Olsten said. ‘I do know about three people that comply with that,’ says Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., the main sponsor of the Senate bill. Enzi's bill would empower states to . require businesses to collect taxes for products they sell on the . Internet, in catalogs and through radio and TV ads. Under the bill, the . sales taxes would be sent to the states where a shopper lives. Businesses with less than $1 million a year in out-of-state sales would be exempt. Burden: Kurt Zentmaier poses with the guitars he sells online. He agrees that small businesses will be unduly burdened by stricter online tax laws . The Senate is expected to pass Enzi's bill Monday. Already, the measure has survived three procedural votes. President Barack Obama supports it, but the bill faces an uncertain fate in the House where some Republicans consider it a tax increase. Supporters say the bill is about fairness for local businesses that already collect sales taxes, and lost revenue for states. Many governors, both Republicans and Democrats, have lobbied the federal government for years for the authority to collect sales taxes from online sales. The issue is getting bigger for states as more people make purchases online. Last year, Internet sales in the U.S. totaled $226 billion, nearly 16 percent more than the previous year, according to Commerce Department estimates. States lost a total of $23 billion last year because they couldn't collect taxes on out-of-state sales, according to a study by three business professors at the University of Tennessee. About $11.4 billion was lost from Internet sales; the rest came from purchases made through catalogs, mail orders and telephone orders, the study said. The study was done for the National Conference of State Legislatures. ‘This is a sales and use tax which is on the books,’ said Michael Kercheval, president and CEO of the International Council of Shopping Centers. ‘This isn't a tax issue. It's a tax collection issue.’ Kercheval's group is part of a broad coalition of retailers that supports Enzi's bill, including Internet giant Amazon, which says it wants a uniform national policy for collecting taxes on Internet sales. Supporters say the bill makes it relatively easy for Internet retailers to comply. States must provide free computer software to help retailers calculate sales taxes, based on where shoppers live. States also must establish a single entity to receive Internet sales tax revenue, so retailers don't have to send them to individual counties or cities. Big money: State legislators hope new laws will help recapture tax revenue lost when consumers makes billions in purchases a year from sites like Amazon . ‘The same software that allows people to figure out shipping costs by ZIP code can figure out what the taxes are,’ Kercheval said. Opponents say the bill doesn't do enough to protect small businesses. EBay wants to exempt businesses with less than $10 million in sales or fewer than 50 employees. ‘Complying and living under the tax laws of 50 states is a major undertaking because the process of complying with tax law goes far beyond just filling out the right forms,’ said Brian Bieron, eBay's senior director of global public policy. ‘You have to deal with the fact that all of these government agencies can audit you and can question you and can actually take you into court and sue you if they think you are doing something wrong.’ Davis, the co-owner of Fashionphile.com, said even with free computer software, her business doesn't have the manpower to separate sales taxes for each state and meet each state's deadline to send in the money. ‘We collect and pay sales tax here in California and we're happy to do that. We receive benefit from that. We can influence lawmakers locally on how those taxes are spent and how much those are and how they're collected,’ Davis said. ‘I don't feel the same about Indiana.’","The U.S. Senate is expected to pass a new law Monday making it easier for states to enforce online sales tax .

"Two police officers pleaded not guilty to assault charges on Wednesday in the violent beat-down of a teenage marijuana suspect who prosecutors say never put up a fight. David Afanador and Tyraine Isaac sat expressionless as defense attorney Stephen Worth entered the plea for them at an appearance in state court in Brooklyn. Afterward, Worth said a widely watched security video of the encounter was misleading. 'It's only damning because it lacks the context which the officers and the other evidence in this case will provide,' Worth said. Charged: New York police officers David Afanador, left, and Tyraine Isaac, right, leave state court following their arraignment on Wednesday where they plead not guilty to assault charges . Defense: Attorney Stephen Worth holds a press briefing on the arraignment of his clients, New York police officers David Afanador and Tyraine Isaac on Wednesday . Prosecution: Amy Rameau, right, attorney for Kahreem Tribble, speaks with reporters following the arraignment in state court of New York police officers David Afanador and Tyraine Isaac . He said the teen marijuana suspect was 'noncompliant' throughout the encounter. Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson, speaking to reporters at his office, took a different view. He called the video convincing evidence of police brutality. 'We had a 16-year-old boy with his hands up, seeking to surrender, who was attacked by members of the force who are supposed to protect him. ... He was defenseless,' Thompson said. 'We've all seen the video. It speaks for itself.' In the video, 16-year-old Kahreem Tribble is seen running away from the officers in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant about 2am on Aug. 29. After a brief chase, Tribble stops running and turns around to face the NYPD cops in apparent surrender. That's when one of the officers, later identified as Tyrane Isaac, approaches the teen and punches him in the head, according to DNAinfo New York. A few seconds later, Officer David Afanador catches up to Tribble — as he raises his hands  — and whacks him in the teeth with the pistol, breaking a front tooth and chipping another, according to the news site. Officer Isaac then later punches the teen again, the website reported. Afanador, who leaves momentarily to find the black bag that Tribble allegedly threw out when he saw the cops, comes back a few minutes later. He waves the bag in the teen's face and smacks him with it. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Officer Tyrane Isaac is seen here punching Kahreem Tribble, 16, just seconds after he stops and surrenders . Officer David Afandondor catches up to Tribble and is seen pistol whipping the teen in the mouth . The two cops began chasing Tribble near 1311 St. John's Place when they spotted the 16-year-old looking through the window of a parked vehicle, according to DNAinfo New York. Police say Tribble tossed out a small black bag before taking off and officers feared he had a gun, the news website reported. Tribble was arrested with 17 small bags of marijuana, court records show. He was also charged with disorderly conduct. The NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau began investigating the arrest and tracked down the video after the teen complained about a mouth injury. Medical records showed that he lost at least two teeth. News of the excessive-force investigation surfaced last month amid an uproar over the death of an unarmed man, Eric Garner, during another videotaped arrest in July on Staten Island. The medical examiner ruled that a banned chokehold used by one of the arresting officers contributed to Garner's death. A grand jury is hearing evidence to consider whether there should be criminal charges brought in the Garner case, with a decision expected before the end of the year. Union officials insist the officer used an authorized takedown move, not a chokehold. Afanador, 33, faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of felony assault. Isaac, 36, faces up to a year if convicted of misdemeanor assault. Both have been suspended from the police force. Police Commissioner William Bratton has said he's eager to identify abusive officers and kick them out of the nation's largest police department.","Officers David Afanador and Tyraine Isaac pleaded not guilty to assault charges on Wednesday in the violent beat-down of a teenage suspect .

Courtney Roth's son Tripp was born in 2009 with only a small blister on his head.

Roth, 27, chronicled her struggles in a blog, as she cared for a newborn doctors told her would not be long for this world. Courtney Roth struggled to keep her newborn son Tripp healthy as he suffered from the debilitating effects of the 'butterfly' condition . Despite constantly suffering damage to both his skin and organs, Tripp survived for two years and eight months . Parents say the condition forces children to endure more suffering in one day than most people do in a lifetime . Even Tripp's internal organs blistered, making malnutrition and loss of fluid and infection common. Mothering . him was a case of trial and error, because every wound would be . different and there was no way to tell how fast they would heal, if in . fact they healed at all. Still, Tripp survived longer than doctors expected, dying only four months shy of his third birthday in 2012. 'These moms and these parents, they're yearning for somebody that's . going through the same situation,' she said. 'It's probably one of the . cruelest, hardest things to have to go through, to watch your child . suffer like that knowing you can't do anything about it.'

'The simplest of things, like dental cleaning or . brushing her teeth, is enough to rip the inside of her mouth open. Yet . this kid gets up and goes to school every day with a smile on her face.

Painful cuts: Little Lizzy Hendrickson suffers from painful cuts on her body if her skin is rubbed . Her real friends, she said, accepted her feeding tube and the full-time nurse by her side without making her self-conscious. Scientists have hope that they can someday find a way to replace the missing protein. In . 2007, University fo Minnesota cancer researchers Dr. John Wagner and . Dr. Jakub Tolar began clinical trials to transplant stem cells in bone . marrow they believed could produce the missing protein. They've since . done two dozen transplants, and their first patient is still alive. 'You could actually see the skin repairing by just looking at the kid,' Wagner told ABC News. To . test the results, Tolar attempts to blister a patient's arm with a . negative vacuum device. A normal patient would take an hour to blister . while a person suffering from the 'butterfly' condition would see . blisters in just minutes. After . Rafi underwent a bone marrow transplant, it took her skin more than 20 . minutes to blister. It's a significant improvement but not a cure. But . the surgery remains controversial after other doctors called him a . 'witch doctor' because bone marrow had no history of affecting skin, . Wagner said. And four patients who underwent a cord blood transplant . after a bone marrow match could not be found died after the transplant. Lizzy Hendrickson, a little girl from Phoenix, Arizona, has also recently been diagnosed with the disease, 12 News Phoenix reports. She can't do simple tasks . without putting herself at risk and to run, play and fall like other . children would likely necessitate a trip to the emergency room. She . can't be showered because of the pressure of falling water and wears . layers of ointment and bandages around her legs - the worst affected . parts of her body. Changing her out of her diapers as a baby was a two person job - her parents told the website. One . had to focus on holding her down and stopping her from wriggling so she . didn't break her skin from the movement while the other removed the . diaper gently with two hands to ensure it didn't tear her by sticking to . her body. 'There’s nothing that I can do, as a mother, to make her pain go away,' Kristin Hendrickson told the local website. 'You . just hope that it ends quickly. But that kind of makes me feel like a . failure as a mother, that I have this child that is in pain or gets hurt . and I can’t protect her.' 'It’s a horrible feeling as a parent. You feel totally out of control.' The . incurable disease affects around 1 in 50,000 and can vary in severity . with most cases at the very mild end of the scale, a much less serious . illness than Lizzy's. Blisters: 3-year-old Lizzy Hendrickson has . painful blisters on her body from her condition, particularly on her . legs, pictured. They have to be constantly bandaged to protect them from . every touch . On the other end some children . are unable to eat solid food as their throats and tongues are affected . with food tearing at their bodies from the inside. Lizzy is able to wear normal clothes but anything sharp like a zipper is strictly banned. Her arms can go un-bandaged but are still sensitive and she often gets blisters on her face. Her parents use ice packs to relieve the pain but are daily forced to pop large blisters that form across her body. Her mother, Kristin, 40, a nurse said the diagnosis was heartbreaking. 'I . can’t possibly describe how I felt at the time,' she told the website. 'I thought my child had a death sentence. It was unthinkable to me. It . was unbearable.' Her father Rob, a teacher, 49, recalls looking up the disease when she was first diagnosed. 'Boy, was that a mistake,' he said. The couple have developed a close relationship with their specialist Dr Ronald Hansen. The . head of dermatology at Phoenix Children’s Hospital discovered her . condition by simply rubbing his pencil eraser on the remaining skin on . her leg - soon it was tearing . 'We . had a number of very interesting conversations with Dr. Hansen very . early on,' Rob said. 'What do we do with her? Do we put her in a bubble? Keep her safe? Or do we make her a normal kid and deal with the . consequences'. The family . were able to count their small blessings that their little girl wasn't . suffering from one of the very extreme types of the disease. Her eating . isn't affected so she can go to school so long as she, and everyone . around her, is extremely careful. Building a normal life: Things are getting easier for Lizzy as she and the people around her learn to live with her condition . Although she can't get into the rough and tumble of the playground her parents want her to have as normal a life as possible. 'I didn’t want to mummy her, keep her like a mummy,' Kristin said. And . the gift of independence is helping. Lizzy now changes her own . dressings and when asked about her condition in school has been known to . reply - 'I'm beautiful'. 'She’s very much a little captain. She’s in charge. She’s a very savvy little girl,' Dr Hansen says. 'But . we kind of always tell (EB) parents, like, this should be their . computer kid. She can’t be the soccer kid, because she just can’t stand . any kind of friction. It causes blisters every time she touches . anything.' 'Having said that, Lizzy will go off and kick a soccer ball. 'She’s going to be a rambunctious, active girl. But she pays for it. Every time. She pays for it with blisters.' The couple, meanwhile, fund-raise to try and help advance research into the disease and hopefully find a cure. 'Will . it be five years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now? We . don’t know,' Rob said. 'We know a cure is coming. We feel that in our . hearts.' Brave: The Hendricksons pictured are fundraising to allow research into their daughter's condition.

"Women desperate to have a baby now have access to a national sperm bank. The centre, based at Birmingham Women’s hospital, will be open to both NHS and private patients undergoing fertility treatment. They will be able to choose a donor from an online catalogue which contains detailed information about the male donor’s height, hair colour, ethnicity, career and hobbies. It will charge between £300 and £400 per sample, although some women will be able to get this for free on the NHS if their local area agrees to fund it. The bank – which has received £77,000 of money from the Department of Health – aims to address a national shortage of donors. A new national sperm bank has opened offering single women, gay couples and those left infertile by cancer treatment the chance to conceive . The centre, which is based at Birmingham Women's Hospital, has received £77,000 in funding from the Department of Health and aims to address the national shortage of donors . This has partly been brought about by a growing demand from single women wanting to start a family without a male partner and lesbian couples. But it also includes those whose husbands or boyfriends have undergone cancer treatment rendering them infertile. Some women who want to have a baby using donated sperm have been routinely waiting for up to two years, with many eventually forced to ‘import it’ from donors abroad. And the majority of men are white which has left women from other ethnicities struggling to find a donor. Until now, sperm has been banked locally at fertility clinics, leading to a patchy service and waiting times of up to two years in some areas. This has led to some women going abroad for treatment while others have gone online to find a donor, putting themselves at risk to HIV and other infections. The national sperm bank aims to have recruited donors 1,000 donors within just three years, who will be paid £35 per donation. Dr Sue Avery, the director of the Birmingham Women's Fertility Centre, said: ‘The idea of the campaign is to focus on sperm donation as a tremendously positive thing to do and that the men who do this are very special. Women can browse the sperm bank's database to choose their done. It will cost around £300 to £400 per sample, while some local health authorities will fund treatment . ‘They're helping to build families. ‘We're spending this money to start something that we hope will grow to the point where nobody has to import sperm.’ Figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority show that fertility clinics in Britain are increasingly relying on importing sperm from abroad. The numbers of overseas sperm donors registering to provide samples each year has increased from less than 50 in 2005 to just under 200 last year. Meanwhile the number of British men registering fell last year from a peak of 450 to 400. Dr Allan Pacey, the chair of the British Fertility Society said: ‘We are importing as a nation more and more sperm from overseas, without being xenophobic it kind of just doesn't feel right, it's a problem that's not going away. ‘Also I think there will always be some patients who, with regards to sperm donors, will want an individual that is more closely related to them in culture and language and outlook.’","Centre at Birmingham Women's Hospital open to NHS and private patients .

"Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to die of Ebola on U.S. soil, succumbed slowly and painfully to the disease, losing bodily functions and eventually the ability even to move. The day after Duncan, a Liberian who flew to Texas, had been admitted to hospital with the deadly disease he begged staff to wrap a diaper round him because he was too exhausted to make it to the toilet. By the time the Liberian national, 45, had been settled down in a hospital bed at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, Dallas, he was projectile vomiting and suffering explosive diarrhea.

Oct 7: Family continue to watch Duncan via close-circuit cameras . Oct 8: Early in the morning Duncan's heartrate slows to less than 50 beats per minute. At 7:51am he is pronounced dead . Family who came to visit him in his final days said that he looked dead already. The harrowing details of how the deadly Ebola virus ravaged Duncan's body were revealed by his 1,400-page medical documents, which his family released to the media. They also reveal small signs of hope Duncan showed before his body began to shutdown. One entry tells how Duncan was 'feeling better' and asked to watch an action movie. Another shows him regaining the semblance of an appetite, managing to eat a few saltine crackers and drink a mouthful of Sprite. But despite attempts to 'stay strong' as he fought the disease, all the signs showed Duncan's body shutting down in the face of Ebola's relentless attacks on his organs. At the end, despite a last-minute dose of experimental drugs, his heart rate slowed and eventually vanished. He was pronounced dead at 7:51am on October 8. Grieving and angry family members wonder whether Duncan, whom they called Eric, might have survived had he not been sent home when he first went to hospital on September 25 with early symptoms. DAY-BY-DAY, HOW EBOLA TOOK HOLD . September 25: Fever, headache, missed signs . Duncan arrived complaining of a headache and abdominal pain. His temperature spiked to 103 at one point, and on a scale of one to 10, he rated his pain as an eight. Doctors ran tests, decided it must be sinusitis, sent him home with antibiotics and told him to follow up with a doctor the next day. A nurse's note said Duncan told her he recently had arrived from Africa. That information did not make it to the attending physician. Victim: Thomas Eric Duncan died of Ebola in Dallas on October 8 after a horrific and painful decline . September 28: Second visit, alarm raised . Three days later Duncan was back, only this time his symptoms included vomiting and diarrhea. His temperature was 103.1 degrees. This time, the nurse's notes made it clear that Duncan had 'just moved here from Liberia.' This time, the doctor got the message. 'I followed strict CDC protocol,' wrote Dr. Otto Javier Marquez-Kerguelen, referring to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for treating potentially infectious patients. Wearing a mask, gloves and full gown, Marquez-Kerguelen began his examination and took a history. 'Pt states he has not been to any rural areas or funerals recently,' he noted. 'Pt denies any sick contacts. Pt denies chills. The pt does not do (sic) any other associated signs of sx (symptoms) at this time.' Among the possible diagnoses: malaria, gastroenteritis, influenza and Ebola. Grief: Nowai Korkoyah, Duncan's mother, speaks to reporters on October 7 - the day before Duncan died. When she saw him hooked up to the machines, barely clinging to life, she wept: 'My son is dead!' In minute detail: Josephus Weeks, Duncan's nephew, sits by a huge stack of his medical records, which the family has released to the media . September 29: 'Ebola should be high on the list' Duncan was put into isolation. The nurses notified county officials; the doctor called the CDC. By evening, Duncan was suffering from explosive diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and projectile vomiting. Efforts to bring down his fever failed. Because Duncan had recently traveled from Liberia, Dr. Gebre Kidan Tseggay noted, 'Ebola virus disease should be high on the list' of differential diagnoses. Missed signs: Nurses at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, Dallas, sent Duncan home when he first arrived at the hospital . Shortly before noon on Monday, September 29, Duncan asked the nurse to put him in a diaper, 'because he feels too tired to keep getting up to the bedside commode'. His fever spiked again to 103, and Duncan was wracked with chills. September 30: 'Patient has tested positive' Blood tests showing damage to the liver and kidneys, and fluctuating blood sugar levels kept doctors scrambling. Tests ruled out influenza, hepatitis, parasites and C-diff, the germ notorious for spreading diarrhea in hospitals and nursing homes. Finally, at 2pm on September 30, doctors received the confirmation that all had been dreading: 'Patient has tested positive for Ebola ...' October 1: False hope, 'patient is feeling better' By October 1, sepsis had set in - but Duncan tried to remain upbeat. 'Pt requested to watch an action movie,' the doctor noted. 'States he is feeling better.' Duncan told his nurse he wanted to try solid food, then refused his lunch tray. The next morning, Duncan told his attendants that his abdominal pain had lessened. He said he was 'trying to keep up good spirits and 'stay strong.'' Vigil: Well-wishers in Dallas gathered at the Wilshire Baptist Church to pray for Duncan after he died . But there was now blood in his urine. Worried about his lung function, doctors added advanced antibiotics to Duncan's medication. That afternoon, he ate his crackers and drank less than 2 ounces of Sprite. October 3-4: Emergency drugs requested . By October 3, the situation had turned dire. Physicians contacted Chimerix, a small pharmaceutical research firm based in Durham, North Carolina. They wanted to try the firm's experimental antiviral drug, brincidofovir. The Food and Drug Administration gave its blessing. Just after midnight October 4, Duncan went into multiple organ failure. By morning, a shipment of brincidofovir arrived and Duncan got the first dose. Deadly disease: Ebola, which is pictured above under a microscope, is infectious and deadly. Duncan, and many of his possessions, were incinerated after his death in a bid to destroy all trace of the virus . October 6: 'His face is like a mask' Monday morning, Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, was picking his way across Louisiana in a hail storm. Riding with him were his son, Josephus Jr., Duncan's sister, Mai Wureh, and Duncan's mother, Nowai Korkoyah. After more than a week of listening to his uncle's failing voice over the phone from his home north of Charlotte, North Carolina, Weeks decided it was time to go to him. That evening, hospital staff escorted the family members to a room in the basement of Texas Presbyterian. The only way they would be allowed to see Duncan was via closed-circuit television. 'My son is dead!' Korkoyah cried out when she saw him. To Weeks, the immobile, expressionless face was 'like a mask.' October 8: Confirmed dead . Wednesday morning, nurses found Duncan's heart rate had dropped into the 40s. They administered drugs, but he was beyond help. 'No palpable pulse,' they noted, 'time of death called.' It was 7:51 a.m. As infectious in death as he was in life, Duncan's body was cremated.","Duncan, a Liberian, flew to the U.S. carrying Ebola and died on October 8 .

"It's the sort of item that you'd more commonly associate with Ancient Egypt, but the sarcophagus is making a comeback as London runs out of burial space. Erith Cemetery, in Bexley, south-east London, opened in 1894 but has been closed to fresh earthen burials for 20 years after it ran out of space. However, it has now opened a new memorial terrace. This has created room for 600 new graves at the site, with the construction of a series of stone mausoleums and sarcophagi on a north-facing slope too steep for conventional burials. Unusual: Erith Cemetery, in Bexley, south-east London, has opened a new memorial terrace, creating room for 600 new graves with the construction of a series of stone mausoleums and sarcophagi on a north-facing slope . Motif: A former construction engineer who have opted to be laid to rest in a sarcophagus helped design his - and has had the Parachute Regiment insignia carved into it . Purchase: Local resident Doug Taffs, 70, has paid about £35,000 for a 75-year lease on three raised grey granite sarcophagi for he and his family . Doug Taffs, 70, is among those who have opted to be laid to rest in a sarcophagus. He has paid about £35,000 for a 75-year lease on three raised grey granite sarcophagi for he and his family. The grandfather-of-five, who served as a paratrooper in the Middle East, the Far East and Northern Ireland, said: ‘Before I would have had to go to Welling to be buried. I don't know Welling. ‘I haven't got a clue about Welling and I don't want to go where I'm not used to. I know it doesn't matter by the time you get in there and it seems a bit macabre but I'm delighted with what I've got.’ The former construction engineer has helped design the sarcophagi and has had the Parachute Regiment insignia carved into the central one. Grandfather-of-five: Mr Taffs served as a paratrooper in the Middle East, the Far East and Northern Ireland . Cemetery structure: The memorial terrace was built by sarcophagus and mausoleum specialists Welters . It's a first: Bexley Cemeteries Officer Jo Pardon (pictured) said Erith Cemetery is the first in the borough to feature above ground burials . The sarcophagus was used in Ancient Egypt as a stone case for a linen-wrapped mummy. When a wealthy person died, they were buried in an elaborate and colorful sarcophagus. Sometimes a mummy would be placed into a series of sarcophagi that fit inside one another. The golden sarcophagus of pharaoh Tutankhamun . Ancient Egyptians saw the sarcophagus as being a surrogate body for the dead. Through the ages sarcophagi have most often been designed to remain above ground, but in Egyptian times some were concealed in tombs. In royal tombs they were surrounded by food and riches to help the deceased in the afterlife. Sarcophagi were carved out of wood in the Early Dynastic period (3100 BC to 2686 BC), and stone materials thereafter. The structure will house him and his wife of five decades Jean, 68, and their daughter Toni, 47. The others are for son Matthew 44 and his wife Claire, 37, and daughter Rebecca Inwood, 36, and her husband Gary, 44. The Taffs family plot is next to one reserved for the sisters of the La Sainte Union convent, based in Bexleyheath. Mr Taffs added: ‘I've got a few villains on one side and some nuns on the other so I'm in good company.’ Bexley Cemeteries Officer Jo Pardon said Erith Cemetery is the first in the borough to feature above-ground burials. The memorial terrace was built by sarcophagus and mausoleum specialists Welters. Mrs Pardon added: ‘People appreciate they put their own individual slant on the design. Those who have a connection to the cemetery have now been given an opportunity to be laid to rest where they want to be.' Last month MailOnline reported how the first Neolithic-style burial chamber built in Britain for 5,000 years was set to open - and 45 customers had already paid for their ashes to be stored there. With space initially for 2,400 ‘customers’, people could reserve a slot for £1,000 each. The tomb, designed by farmer Tim Daw, was positioned to let the midwinter sunrise shine right down the length of the chamber where people’s ashes will be placed in urns set into the walls.","Erith Cemetery has been closed to fresh earthen burials for 20 years .

"Jim Dunbar has been late for work, holidays, meals with friends and even snuck into funerals after they've begun . A man who has been late for everything in his life - from funerals to first dates - has had his chronic tardiness diagnosed as a medical condition. Jim Dunbar has been late for work, holidays, meals with friends, left women waiting on first dates and even had to sneak into funerals long after they’ve begun. The 57-year-old said that his poor timekeeping is down to a medical condition that he was diagnosed with at an appointment at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee - which he was 20 minutes late for. Mr Dunbar, of Forfar in Angus, still struggles to arrive on time despite his diagnosis of chronic lateness. It is thought that the condition is caused by the same part of the brain affected by those who suffer from Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and means Mr Dunbar cannot properly gauge how long things take to complete. Mr Dunbar said: 'The reason I want it out in the open is that there has got to be other folk out there with it and they don’t realise that it’s not their fault. 'I blamed it on myself and thought ""Why can’t I be on time? I lost a lot of jobs. I can understand people’s reaction and why they don’t believe me. The 57-year-old has said that his poor timekeeping is down to medical condition which he was diagnosed with at an appointment at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee - which he was 20 minutes late for . 'It’s depressing sometimes. I can’t overstate how much it helped to say it was a condition.' It . is thought that the condition originates in the same part of the brain . that is affected by those who suffer with Attention-Deficit . Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In fact, many ADHD sufferers complain they struggle to keep time. Some psychologists believe that chronic lateness could be a symptom of an underlying mood disorder such as depression. A recent study of more than 200 people at San Francisco State University showed that 17 per cent were chronically late. Those . unable to be punctual displayed similar patterns in behaviour including . anxiety issues, and trouble with self-control. Researchers said the problem -- whether it affects a person personally or professionally -- is not irreversible, however. Psychologists . recommend those affected to work to make deadlines . non-negotiable, monitor how long it takes to perform certain tasks and . always plan to be early. Mr Dunbar recently tried to go to the cinema and knowing it could be a problem getting to Dundee’s DCA cinema for a 7pm showing, he gave himself an 11-hour head start. But he still managed to arrive 20 minutes late. Mr Dunbar said: 'I got up at 8:15am to go to a David Bowie film at the DCA that started at seven o’clock. 'That gave me 11 hours to get ready. I knew I was going there - and I was 20 minutes late. 'I get down about it and it’s disturbing for other folk when you arrive late.' The former Dundee City Council worker has a special clock in his living room which uses radio frequencies tuned to a national transmitter to make sure that the time it displays is always exactly right, down to the second but it doesn’t help. He has tried wearing a watch, setting his clocks fast but still hasn’t found a solution. Mr Dunbar has tackled this problem his entire life and can remember being late for school as a five-year-old and until his diagnosis last year, blamed himself. He said: 'My family don’t believe it and think I’m making excuses. 'I’ve been late for funerals and slipped in and hid at the back of the hall. I arranged to pick my friend up at midday to go on holiday and was four hours late. 'He was furious because we had booked a ferry and everything. A friend invited me for a meal and I was more than three hours late. 'It has affected my entire life.' But some experts are sceptical about Mr Dunbar's diagnosis. 'The condition isn't in the DSM5 (the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) so I'm not sure you can really call it a condition,' said Dr Sheri Jacobson, psychotherapist and director of Harley Therapy Clinic in London. 'Repeated lateness is usually a symptom of an underlying condition such as ADHD or depression but it can also just be habit. 'I think making everyday human behaviour into a medical condition is unwise.'","Jim Dunbar has been late for work, .

"Living in the heart of Tornado Alley - people from Kansas have learned how to prepare for the worst. But the state's governor, Sam Brownback, appears to have taken this practice to new limits after officially declaring October 'Zombie Preparedness Month'. The Republican politician, 58, will sign a formal declaration today encouraging Kansans to ready themselves for all disasters including an invasion of the walking dead. Warning: Kansas's governor, Sam Brownback, has named October 'Zombie Preparedness Month' (above, a woman takes part in a zombie gathering world record attempt in Sydney) At the end of the month Kansans could get the chance to put their plans into action as Halloween descends on October 31 - bringing it with it a high chance of zombies. Citizens are being told to arm themselves for a zombie invasion in much the same way they would for a typhoon, flood or other natural disaster, TIME reports. A spokesman from the governor's office said: 'We came up with the idea of Zombie Preparedness Month because it is an engaging way to get people on board with emergency preparedness. 'If you’re equipped to handle the zombie apocalypse then you’re prepared for tornadoes, severe storms, fire and any other natural disaster Kansas usually faces. 'If you’re prepared for zombies, you’re prepared for anything.' Ready yourselves: Kansans have been told to stockpile supplies which they could survive off for three days in the event of an invasion of zombies, like those pictured above from hit TV show The Walking Dead . A spokesman for the governor (above) said: 'If you’re equipped to handle the zombie apocalypse then you’re prepared for tornadoes, severe storms, fire and any other natural disaster Kansas usually faces' Nearly three million citizens are being asked to ensure that they have survival supplies which would last them three days in the event of a zombie uprising. Speaking to The Telegraph, the state's Deputy Emergency Operations manager said: 'You want to make sure you have all the food and water you need. 'You need to work on your zombie alerts. Of course if you look like a zombie you may be able to escape from them. You may want to avoid cemeteries. At the end of the month Kansans could get the chance to put their plans into practice as Halloween descends on October 31 - bringing it with it a high chance of zombies (scene from The Walking Dead, above) 'Good cardio fitness is useful if you want to run away and have good running shows. Ladies should get rid of their high heels.' Preparing for a zombie uprising appears to be one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans can agree on as it is believed a 31-page document has been produced, outlining the strategy if the worst was to happen. Kansans are being offered the chance to learn more about zombie preparedness at a lecture in Topeka tomorrow - where a free disaster pack will be given to the first 300 people. Using zombies as a hypothetical worst-case scenario is not unheard of in the U.S. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ran a zombie awareness campaign of its own while the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also had an initiative in 2012.","Sam Brownback made bizarre announcement in Kansas statehouse today .

"A Florida mother has been granted an emergency motion to prevent her son's circumcision. Heather Hironimus gave birth to her son Chase, who is three-and-a-half, with Dennis Nebus in October 2010. In December 2011, she signed a parenting agreement, court records obtained by the Broward-Palm Beach New Times show. Not my son! Mother Heather Hironimus, seen here with son Chase, was granted an emergency motion preventing his circumcision . That agreement, which was rendered in January 2012, said Nebus would be responsible for scheduling and paying for his son's circumcision. Two years later, Hironimus changed her mind about the circumcision. Last Wednesday, she testified in court that she did not want Chase to 'undergo requisite general anesthesia for fear of death,' records show. Urologist Dr. Charles Flack said in court that though circumcisions are not necessary, 'penile cancer occurs only in uncircumcised males and uncircumcised males have a higher risk of HIV infection than uncircumcised males,' according to records. In his ruling last Friday, Judge Jeffrey Gillen said 'there is no reason' why the circumcision shouldn't take place. That ruling also said that Hironimus 'shall not in any way lead [Chase] to believe that she is or was opposed to his being circumcised, whether or not she accompanies [him] to the procedure.' Mother: Heather Hironimus, pictured, signed a parenting agreement in 2011 which said that Chase's father, Dennis Nebus, would arrange and pay for the circumcision . Hironimus, on a GoFundMe page to 'Save My Son from Circumcision,' says only Chase, whom she describes as 'fully aware,' should be able to decide whether or not to have a circumcision. 'I am pleading with fellow intactavists [sic], parents and all others to help me save my son, his foreskin, his rights and hopefully other children from allowing the ""system"" to make these decisions,' she says. As of this writing, Hironiums has raised $5,228 of her $10,000 goal. On Wednesday, a West Palm Beach court granted Hironimus an emergency motion to stay.","Heather Hironimus, mother to son Chase, signed a parenting agreement approved in 2012 that said his father Dennis Nebus would arrange and pay for the circumcision .

"Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell has slammed Mama June for bringing the man who molested her as a child into contact with her two younger siblings, Honey Boo Boo and Pumpkin. 'It's Mama's fault!' Anna said through tears in an exclusive interview with Entertainment Tonight that will air on Thursday. 'She has to live with it. She brung the past back.' The emotional interview comes after photographs emerged showing June Shannon with Mark McDaniel, 53, who served 10 years behind bars for sexually abusing Anna when she was just eight. 'I feel betrayed,' Anna told ET correspondent Nischelle Turner. 'He did this to me. Why would you let him come around the girls, knowing what he did?' Scroll down for video . Devastated: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell sobs in the arms of Entertainment Tonight correspondent Nischelle Turner as she talks about how hurt she is that her mother has been seen with her molester . Distraught: Anna, who will appear in the interview on ET on Thursday, was sexually abused when she was eight . She added that she now fears for her sisters, nine-year-old Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson and Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14. The interview comes after a police report revealed that Pumpkin was forced to watch as Anna was sexually abused by McDaniel - then her mother's live-in boyfriend - in 2002. According to Spalding County Superior Court documents obtained by RadarOnline, Lauryn was just three when she witnessed McDaniel attacking her sister, then eight, on at least one occasion. 'Anna…stated that her sister, Lauryn, is in the bed with them when this is going on,' the report noted. For her part, Lauryn has taken to her Instagram page to slam what she calls 'false' stories. Anger: Anna is a married mother-of-one and has said her mother is not allowed contact with her daughter . But the police report from 2003 shows how, after revealing the abuse to her elementary school teacher in 2003, Anna told the officer that McDaniel molested her in June's bedroom while she was at work. She told authorities that she had done the 'S word' with Mark McDaniel, the report shared by RadarOnline reveals. She also told police that her mother's boyfriend touched her inappropriately, made her touch him inappropriately and forced her to perform a sex act on him. When she told him to stop, he would not, the grand jury heard. The molestation was carried out multiple times between April and October 2002, according to the report. It took Anna months to speak out about the abuse because McDaniel had threatened to kill her if she told, RadarOnline reported. 'Anna stated that Mark told her not to tell because he would not like her anymore,' the police report said. 'Anna advised she got tired of holding it in and had to tell.' Sickening: Mark McDaniel, pictured, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for child molestation. Anna said he repeatedly abused her in 2002 and threatened to kill her and her family if she told anyone . Back in her life: Mama June is pictured beside her nine-year-old daughter Alana, also known as Honey Boo Boo, and her former boyfriend Mark McDaniel (back), who was jailed for assaulting her older daughter . Speaking to the National Enquirer in 2012, Anna's ex-boyfriend added: 'Anna told me that McDaniel threatened that if she ever told her grandparents what happened to her, he’d kill them and her.' In June 2003, McDaniel was indicted for child molestation, aggravated child molestation and aggravated sexual battery in Henry County but the case was soon dropped. Denial: Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14, has denied that her mother has been seeing McDaniel again . He was then indicted in Spalding County for rape, child molestation, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes and aggravated sexual battery. McDaniel was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He left prison in March and has reportedly been seeing Mama June again. Earlier this week, Anna revealed to People magazine that when she told her mother what McDaniel had done to her, June did not believe her. 'A week or so after it happened, I talked to Mama and she was upset, crying and saying, ""I don't believe you, I don't believe you, why would you do this to me?""' she remembered. 'And I was like, ""Mama, he did that to me and I can't do anything about it. You were never there to see it. You were always at work"".' Anna, who appeared on 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' before TLC canceled the show in light of the allegations that Mama June has let the pedophile near to her children, is now married with a two-year-old daughter. She said she will not let the couple near her child. Mama June has denied that she is dating the child molester. 'The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue,' she said in a video posted at the weekend. 'I would not ever, ever, ever, ever put my kids in danger.' But photographs have emerged showing June and McDaniel looking for houses in Griffin last month, while another image shows him touching her daughter, Alana, who is just nine. Despite Mama June's protests, TLC has announced that they were cancelling the series because of Shannon's relationship with McDaniel. Moving on: Anna, left with her husband and right with their daughter, said she is hurt by reports that her mother could be back together with her abuser - and that they will not be allowed to come near her child . And a friend of Alana's father, Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, told MailOnline that he is gearing up for a custody battle after learning that Mama June has allowed McDaniel to come into contact with her. McDaniel is not the only sex offender she has dated. She also went out with Michael Anthony Ford, 37, the father of her 17-year-old daughter Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon. After the pair split, he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet in 2005 and remains on the sex offender registry. According to prison records, Ford is currently behind bars on a separate child abandonment charge. The fathers of Shannon’s other children also have criminal records but rather than being sex-related their crimes included arson and burglary.","Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, 20, spoke out about her anger towards Mama June in an emotional interview that will air on Thursday .

'I don’t know if we will ever know exactly why everything happened the way it did,' sheriff’s spokeswoman Debbie Carter told the Tampa Bay Tribune. However, the report did reveal several seemingly small issues that could have mounted to something more, inspiring Campbell to commit the shocking annihilation of his family. Those issues include some financial stress, trouble at Campbell's work and in his marriage as well as reports of strict parenting concerning son Collin's baseball prospects and new bruises appearing on daughter Megan's body. Remains: Investigators say the family had some debts but appeared to be financially solvent for the most part. They were up to date with rent on the $1.6million mansion they rented from former tennis professional James Blake. A picture of the home after the incident last May, above . Investigators say that the Campbell family had some outstanding debt, which mounted at the beginning of the year, but it appeared the family's finances were mostly solvent, since they were up to date with rent and maintained a $4,000 average balance in their checking account. 'It is obvious that some financial distress occurred after the first of the year,' the report reads. 'Those balances that would normally be paid off, were not and then carried forward after January 2014. Also, bills that were paid by Kimberly began being partially paid by Darrin or not paid at all.' Kimberly's friends said she seemed to have no trouble spending money on a nice hotel in Nashville, Tennessee the weekend before her murder, at which point she also shelled out for a pair of $250 shoes. However, there did seem to be troubles in her marriage. Blaze: The week before her murder, Kimberly went on a girl's trip with her friends scheduled the weekend of her anniversary. She allegedly told her friends that she and her husband 'don't talk much anymore' Stocking up: It appears Campbell planned the murders and his suicide. He purchased the gun used in the attack, and cans of oil and fireworks to burn down the house in the weeks leading up to May 7 . 'Kim said it was their anniversary, but that her and Darren don’t talk much anymore.' friend Amy Jordan told investigators. An investigator concluded in the report though that they 'did not get the feeling that there was anything going wrong in the relationship between Darrin and Kim.' Landlord: Above, former American tennis professional James Blake. Blake owned the house where the Campbells were living at the time of the murders . While Campbell was described as a caring and involved father, his children allegedly told friends about his strict and controlling behavior. Collin's high school baseball coach says Campbell had unrealistic expectations about his son's college prospects, and that he became upset when the average player only got an offer to play at a Division II college, instead of a larger Division I school. In the weeks leading up to the attacks, daughter Megan's friends began noticing fresh bruises on her body which the 16-year-old attributed to dance injuries. Friends say though that Megan had been dancing for years and they had never noticed the injuries before. The night of her death, Megan was supposed to spend the night at a friend's house, but she cancelled at the last minute saying her dad was making her stay at home for 'family time' - something he had allegedly never done before. And it appears Campbell planned the murders some time in advance. He purchased a .40 caliber handgun, fireworks and oil in the weeks before the shooting and just two days before asked for a leave of absence from his work where he was the chief operating officer of a digital services company. That request led one employee to text Campbell to ask if he was ok. Campbell responded to that message two days later with a 'no' sent at 3:25am the morning of the murders. Just a few hours later, firefighters responded to reports of a  fire at the home.","Darrin Campbell shot dead his wife and their teenage son and daughter last May before setting their house on fire and turning the gun on himself .

"Former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, 93, is now in hospice care with Alzheimer's. Pictured: 2013 . Former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee's wife says her husband is receiving hospice care after his health has declined over the past two months. Bradlee's wife, Sally Quinn, said in a television interview broadcast Sunday that the 93-year-old  has suffered from Alzheimer's disease for several years and that his health has recently deteriorated. The Washington Post reports that Quinn says Bradlee sleeps 20 hours a day and doesn't eat much. Quinn, who is a journalist and met Bradlee at the newspaper, says her husband began hospice care at the couple's home in Washington in mid-September. She said her husband of over four decades still sleeps at home in their bed next to her and still knows who she is. 'We spent a lot of time together and we hold hands and he knows me and he loves having me there and it is just extremely rewarding to be able to be there for him now,' she said. In the C Span interview Quinn, 73, says it became obvious Bradlee had the condition about two years ago. Bradlee was the editor of The Post from 1968 and 1991, during the newspaper's coverage of the Pentagon Papers and the Watergate scandal, which helped lead to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Bradlee is currently vice president at large of The Post and until recent months he used to go back to the newspaper and have lunch with his former colleagues.

Quinn says she did not tell Bradlee about actress Lauren Bacall's death in August straight away due to his condition. On 12 August, when Bacall died, Quinn tweeted: 'So so sad about the death of Betty Bacall. 'I almost lost Ben to her, the only acceptable person. As he would say,she was a spectacular dame.' She then wrote a piece in the Washington Post which she posted on Twitter which was headlined 'How would you like to compete, as I did, with Lauren Bacall for a man?'

The article details how Bradlee and Bacall first met at a fireworks party in Amagansett and the pair disappeared for an hour . 'Ben and I had only recently gotten together, and now I was about to lose him to the sexiest movie star alive. It was at least an hour before they emerged from the dunes, laughing and talking as though they had no concept of time. 'Ben looked so pleased with himself I could have belted him. He was a bit sheepish when he joined me, and I looked hawkishly for signs of dishevelment, lipstick on the collar. I found nothing, but still. 'It was no consolation when Betty came over to me as we were leaving and confided in me that Ben was the only man who had ever reminded her of Bogey. (Bogey, of course, being her first husband, Humphrey Bogart.)' Co-incidentally Bacall’s second husband, actor Jason Robards, played Bradlee in the 1976 Watergate movie All The President’s Men.

"The government's multi-billion pound home loans scheme is not pushing up property prices, the Bank of England insisted today. Governor Mark Carney said Help to Buy does not pose a risk to financial stability and has not driven up house values by increasing demand. It is a major boost for Chancellor George Osborne, who has faced calls to rein in the mortgage guarantee scheme to only cover homes worth less than £260,000. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne has faced calls to limit the Help to Buy Scheme to much cheaper homes, but has been backed by the Bank of England . Under the £3.5billion equity loan scheme, introduced in April last year, first-time buyers and home movers can get help to buy a property worth up to £600,000. More than 35,000 homes have been bought using it so far, amid claims Britain is not building enough houses to cope with rising demand. In August, the head of the OECD global economic think tank called for the price limit to be more than halved to prevent a new property price bubble. But now Mr Carney has written to the Chancellor to say the £600,000 house price cap, and the fee charged to lenders who use it, 'remain appropriate'. He added the Help to Buy 'does not pose material risks to financial stability'. The intervention comes after first annual review by the Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) of the scheme. Bank of England governor Mark Carney  has written to the Chancellor to say the £600,000 house price cap, and the fee charged to lenders who use it, 'remain appropriate' Latest figures from the Natonwide building society showed that house prices actually fell by 0.2 per cent last month, in the latest sign that the property market is cooling. However, prices are still dramatically higher than a year ago, ranging from 21 per cent in London to 4.3 per cent in the north of England. Mr Carney said that while there had been steep house price growth, Help to Buy 'does not appear to have been a material driver of that growth', with weak take-up in London where rises have been strongest. On Help to Buy, Mr Carney said the scheme had seen a return of lenders to the high loan-to-value market - representing mortgages of 90 per cent or more of a property's value. But the level of these remained relatively small compared with before the financial crisis, accounting for 9 per cent of mortgages in the year to date compared with 25 per cent in 2007. 'Looking ahead, and based on uptake of the scheme so far, we expect the volume of HTB loans to grow, but to become only a modest proportion of lenders' mortgage books over the life of the scheme.' In response Mr Osborne said: 'I was pleased to see the committee's conclusions that the scheme does not pose material risks to financial stability in the UK and has not been a material driver of recent house price growth.' The average house in the UK costs to £188,374, edging down from the all-time peak of £189,306 recorded in August, according to latest figures from Nationwide . The Bank's request for new powers to rein in risky home loans comes after Mr Osborne offered them earlier this year - beefing up its current ability to offer recommendations for controls on the market. It said the availability of powers of direction rather than just recommendation could allow it to skirt the need for time-consuming consultation 'where urgent implementation is required'. 'This can be an important consideration in a market like housing, where quick implementation may be necessary to prevent lenders and borrowers bringing forward transactions in anticipation of policy changes, putting more pressure on the market.' The Bank is asking for powers of direction over LTV ratios as well as debt-to-income (DTI) ratios.","Mark Carney said Help to Buy does not pose a risk to financial stability .

"A patriotic  couple insists the 'Australian flag stays' after being told to remove it from their front yard because of the 'current political climate'. But body corporate Castle Real Estate in Darwin, Northern Territory has denied the order was because of the political climate and said the couple failed to apply for permission. Homeowners Paul and Julie Lucas completed their renovations to their Stuart Park property by erecting the flag pole to a fence. Scroll down for video . Paul Lucas appeared on Channel 9's program Sunrise on Monday. He said the flag will stay after body corporate ordered him to take down the Australia flag that is flying outside the block of units . They say the order is unjust and insist there are no laws against flying the Australian flag on a property, the NT news  reports. It’s not there to upset anyone, (but) why do we have to be like this in our own country? People come here because they like the way we live,' Mr Lucas said. Patriotism in the Lucas family goes back three generations - he, his father and his grandfather all served in the Australian Defence Force. 'We’re patriotic people, I’m proud of my forefathers and what people continue to do for us in this country,' he said. Both Mr and Mrs Lucas were shocked when body corporate told to remove the flag and said they thought it was a joke. Mr Lucas believes this demand is 'political correctness gone mad' and the flag was raised to embrace multiculturalism in Australia . Mr Lucas insists raising the flag was a tribute to Australia's multiculturalism and is a way to welcome people of all kind. He said the demand is 'political correctness gone mad'. 'In this country at the moment everyone is scared to be Australian – if you look at America for instance they are so patriotic and proud of their country - why shouldn't Australians embrace it', Mr Lucas said on Monday's program Sunrise on Channel 7. Mr Lucas told Sunrise there were discussions offline that eluded to the belief the removal order was because of the current political climate. He contends the body corporate called him the next morning the flag was raised and told him it is a 'politically sensitive thing'. According to Mr Lucas, the phone conversation went on to discuss planning and regulations but Mr Lucas insists he and his wife were told they could conduct any renovations because it 'was not attached to the building'. 'If someone mentions political before anything else well it's not the pole - it's political', he said. But Daniel Ferguson,  Managing Director at Castle Real Estate, said this order has nothing to do with Australia's political climate, instead insists the structure is in breach of body corporate. Mr Ferguson said the Lucas' had to ask for permission for a flag to fly at the block of units. A statement from Castle Real Estate highlights the company's stance on safety and regulations. ‘Attaching the flag pole to the fence that forms part of the swimming pool barrier may contravene the swimming pool safety act 2014. 'Members of the body corporate are waiting to receive and discuss an application from Paul and Julie Lucas to erect a structure on the unit,' it reads.

"Jailed: Cheating mother-of-two Lynne Keeling swindled £41,000 in incapacity benefit . A lying mother who swindled £41,000 in benefits claiming she needed to wear a neck brace at all times and use a walking stick  was caught lifting a heavy suitcase into a car and working as a teaching assistant. Cheating Lynne Keeling, 51, said it took her between three and five minutes to walk just 20 to 30 metres and that she needed help going to the toilet and was prone to falling over. But undercover investigators discovered she worked 25 hours a week as a teaching assistant at a primary school and that part of her job included pushing disabled pupils around in their wheelchairs. Keeling had initially been entitled to incapacity benefits but she failed to inform . the authorities when her health improved and continued to pocket the state . hand-outs. Over a seven year period between November 8, 2006 and July 13, 2013 she fradulently claimed £41,789.85 in incapacity benefits. Keeling was jailed for 27 weeks at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday after . pleading guilty to dishonestly failing to notify a change of . circumstances in relation to her claims for disability living allowance. Judge . Paul Glenn said: 'This offending is serious. Benefit fraud is very . prevalent. It is very easy to commit and very difficult to detect. 'The . victims are hard-working taxpayers and those involved in worthy causes . who can’t obtain public funding because people like you limit the amount . of funds available. 'Just . three months after you made the claim you were working five days a week . in a school and you stayed there for over six years. 'Your . duties at the school were such you could not possibly have performed . them if you were anything like as incapacitated as you purported to be. 'You perpetuated this fraud for close on seven years, a very significant period.' The court heard Keeling worked 25-hours-a-week at Maple Court Primary School, in Bentilee, Staffs., from November 8, 2006. After being made redundant on December 31, 2012 the married mum began attending Stoke-on-Trent College. Scroll down for video . Caught out: Benefits cheat Lynne Keeling is pictured lifting a heavy suitcase into her car despite claiming she needed to wear a neck brace at all times and could barely walk . It . was there where investigators filmed Keeling getting out of her . mobility car and walking without any difficulty on March 6 and March 27, . 2013. Prosecutor . Joanne Wallbanks said: 'She seemed to be walking perfectly well with no . neck brace or sticks. She lifts a case out the boot and carries it with . ease.' The mother-of-two, from Bentilee, was interviewed on July 5, 2013 and claimed she was in constant pain. The . court heard she has since appealed and has been allowed a ‘lower rate’ of benefits, although the matter has not been fully resolved. Stuart Muldoon, defending, said: 'Mrs Keeling has had difficulties with her health over the years.' On the go: Keeling, who has been jailed for 27 weeks , is pictured casually strolling down the street with two other women . No sweat: Keeling hoists the heavy suitcase into the air.

"China has sent two fighter jets to investigate US and Japanese military planes’ entry into a disputed area of the East China Sea. Tensions in the volatile region have mounted since the Chinese Air Force stated that it ‘escorted’ foreign warplanes out of its newly-declared air defence identification zone (ADIZ). The zone covers islands which are the subject of a bitter territorial dispute with Japan – sparking fears that it could lead to an unplanned military incident. Two Japanese F-15 fighter jets: China scrambled jets today in response to U.S. spy planes and Japanese aircraft - including F-15 fighters - entering its new air defence zone over the East China Sea . Last week Beijing declared that all . aircraft crossing through airspace must file flight plans and identify . themselves or face unspecified ‘defensive emergency measures’. But the . US, Japan and South Korea have all defied the ruling over the past few . days. In an intensification . of the spat, China yesterday launched fighter jets into the area at the . same time as foreign military flights. Chinese . Air Force spokesman Colonel Shen Jinke said warplanes had been . scrambled to monitor two US surveillance aircraft and ten Japanese . planes, including an F-15 fighter jet, crossing through the ADIZ. He was reported by state media as saying that the jets had tracked and identified the planes. Ministers . in Tokyo declined to give details of the flights but said the Japanese . Air Force was on routine operations and had encountered no ‘abnormal’ incidents. China announced the creation of the zone last Saturday. Overlapping claims: This map shows the respective air defence and economic zones claimed by China and Japan and with the islands in the East China Sea that the two countries have been disputing highlighted . It covers a vast area of the East China Sea, including a region where gas has been discovered. The row centres on airspace over three uninhabited outcrops called the Senkaku Islands by Japan and Diaoyu by China. Taiwan . also has a claim to the islands – bought by Japan from private sellers . in 2012, much to the anger of China – and South Korea maintains an . interest in a submerged rock in the zone known as Ieodo. The US called . the establishment of the ADIZ a ‘destabilising attempt to alter the . status quo in the region’. Baroness Ashton, the EU foreign policy envoy, expressed concern about the diplomatic flare-up. She . said: ‘This development heightens the risk of escalation and . contributes to raising tensions in the region. The EU calls on all sides . to exercise caution and restraint.’ Worth fighting for? An October 13 file photo shows a Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force patrol plane flying past one of the unoccupied disputed islets in the East China Sea claimed by both China and Japan . But her intervention was mocked by China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang. ‘Madam . Ashton should know that some European countries also have air defence . identification zones,’ said Qin. ‘I don’t know if this leads to tensions . in the European regional situation. European countries can have air . defence identification zones. Why can’t China?’ International . analysts claim Beijing is engaged in a long-term strategy to boost its . claims to the disputed islands, rather than displaying a military show . of force. June Teufel . Dreyer, a security specialist at the University of Miami, said the . policy was aimed at placating the domestic audience.

"A young mother died of cervical cancer despite being seen by doctors fifty times in six years, her family claimed today. Luisa Guerra, 35, from Kent, was so desperate for answers she paid for a private scan and then found out tumours had spread throughout her body. Her sister says she first visited her local GP complaining of back pain but was sent home and told to take paracetamol. The pain failed to go and she continued to visit the surgery over the course of three years but it was not diagnosed and  blamed on 'stress' and early menopause, her family has claimed. Tragedy: The family of young mother Luisa Guerra claim that she was seen 50 times by doctors who failed to properly diagnose the cervical cancer that killed her . It was only when she paid for a private scan that the real reason for her deteriorating health became clear - she had tumours in her cervix, lymph nodes, back and neck. She was finally diagnosed with cervical cancer but it was too late and, despite  chemotherapy, the mother-of-two died aged 35. An official complaint has now been made and will be investigated by the local NHS Trust on October 27. Luisa's sister Diana, 22, claims she 'could have been saved' if doctors had acted quicker. Diana said: 'I am devastated that I lost my sister. Knowing that she would still be here today if doctors had taken her seriously makes me very angry. 'They had more than 50 opportunities over six years to help her, but they never did. She was so young.' Interior designer Luisa was just 29 when she started suffering from back pain, headaches and irregular bleeding. Over the course of three years she visited her local doctors at City Way Surgery, in Rochester, Kent, but was diagnosed with early menopause and stress. Her family say she was never offered a smear test by medics, despite all women over 25 being entitled to one on the NHS. Claims: Luisa's family say doctors at City Way Surgery, in Rochester, Kent, diagnosed her with early menopause and stress during her initial cancer and then relapse . In 2010 Luisa, then aged 31, paid £300 for a consultation at a private clinic where she was immediately diagnosed with cervical cancer. In June 2011 she started a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and by December was given the all clear. But she was forced to return to City Way Surgery when her back pain began again. Her family claim the same GPs again dismissed her symptoms and prescribed her morphine for the pain. By the time she underwent a scan ten months later she was told she had a tumour the size of a tennis ball in her lymph nodes, as well as cancer in her neck and bowel. This time there was nothing doctors could do, and Luisa died in February this year. It is also alleged that Luisa's aunt Teresa Paiva, 43, visited the same surgery in January 2013 complaining of stomach pains and was simply told to 'take vitamins'. She claims the mum of two begged doctors to help her for six months before she was diagnosed with gall stones and had an operation to remove them. But Teresa's symptoms did not ease and more than a year after her first visit to the GP she found a lump in her breast. Feeling let down by her local health service she flew out to Portugal, where she was born, and paid for private screening. She was diagnosed with stage 3B breast cancer and is now being treated in Portugal. Diana said: 'Not only did I lose my best friend and sister at such a young age because of someone else's negligence, but now the same thing appears to be happening again. 'I believe my sister and auntie didn't get the correct care because it's too expensive to send patients for MRIs and CT scans. 'I will fight with everything I have to get justice for my girls.' Luisa's family met bosses at the City Way Surgery to express their concerns but were told to put their complaints in writing. NHS England, Kent and Medway, said 'We are sorry to learn of this very sad case. If NHS England receives a complaint of this nature we will always follow it up appropriately.'","Luisa Guerra, 35, had her cancer diagnosed as stress and early menopause .
