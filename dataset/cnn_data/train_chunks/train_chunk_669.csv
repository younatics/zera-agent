Rapist: This Sept. 12, 2013 file photo released by the Montana State Prison shows Stacey Rambold, a 54-year-old teacher who is serving a 30-day sentence in prison for raping a former student who later killed herself . Prison officials have today released former high school teacher Stacey Rambold, 54, the man sentenced to just 30-days behind bars even after admitting raping a 14-year-old girl. His lenient punishment for the 2007 rape of Cherice Moralez, who killed herself three-years later, was handed down to him by District Judge Todd Baugh and the comments made by Baugh about Moralez sparked national outrage. Rambold, who was 48 when he committed the crimes in 2007, left the Montana State Prison in Deer Lodge at around 9.30am local time. State prosecutors are appealing the sentence, saying Rambold should have received a minimum of two years. But barring new offenses, the former teacher has served his time and will stay out of prison pending the appeal.Rambold was picked up at the prison by a family member and was expected to return to Billings, prison spokeswoman Linda Moodry said. He has been registered as a level 1 sex offender - meaning he's considered a low risk to re-offend- and will remain on probation through 2028 unless the original sentence is overruled.Moralez's mother, Auliea Hanlon, said Rambold's release shows he is ""still skating"" justice six years after he assaulted her daughter. He served his month-long sentence at the Martz Diagnostic Intake Unit, a prison facility adjacent to the main prison grounds in Deer Lodge where new inmates are screened before being placed in a more permanent housing unit. It is understood he served his sentence with no incidents and there was no record of disciplinary issues. Ms Hanlon spoke on Tuesday of her hopes that the Montana Supreme Court would overturn Judge Baugh's decision and re-sentence the former Billings high school teacher. Indeed, the prosecutors in the case have appealed the sentence, claiming it is illegal and on Tuesday the Montana and Pennsylvania chapters of the National Organization of Womenfiled a complaint with a judicial review board on behalf of more than 140,000 who signed a petition against the sentence. The case attracted international attention when Baugh handed down a one-month sentence to Rambold and said that Moralez, 'seemed older than her chronological age"" and she was ""as much in control of the situation.' Hanlon told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she wants to avoid Rambold. 'I never saw him until we were in a courtroom all those years,' she said. 'I hope I never see him again. Blocked: . Montana Supreme Court voted 4-2 barring Judge Todd Baugh (pictured) from holding a hearing to possibly amend rapist's 30-day sentence' Disgusted: Auliea Hanlon told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she never wants to see Stacey Rombold, the man who raped her daughter and that she is yet to see justice for her daughters sexual assault . Earlier this month, Montana's highest court ruled today that a state judge does not have the authority to amend a controversial 30-day sentence he handed down to Rombold. The lenient jail term and the judge's provocative argumentation sparked widespread outrage among women's groups and victims’ advocates. Amid public outcry and growing pressure from the persecution, who vowed to appeal the sentence, Judge Baugh apologized earlier this month for his earlier remarks and called a hearing to re-examine and possibly amend Rambold's sentence - a move the state attorney general challenged as being outside Baugh's legal authority. On Friday 6th of September, Montana . Supreme Court agreed, ruling 4-2 against Baugh's planned unilateral . action, and paving the way for prosecutors to file an appeal. ‘We . conclude that the stated intent of the District Court (Baugh) to alter . the initially imposed oral sentence in today's scheduled hearing is . unlawful and that the proceeding should be arrested,’ the court ruled, . without commenting on the validity of the sentence itself. Horror: Cherice Moralez, pictured, shot herself dead in her mother's bed after being repeatedly raped by a teacher who will serve just 30 days in jail . The decision came down just hours before the state judge was to convene the hearing to reconsider the sentence. In a bizarre twist, the defense joined the prosecution in opposing the scheduled hearing , saying that it would be 'without legal authority.' The prosecution said the 54-year-old disgraced educator probably should have received a minimum of two years in prison instead of the 15-year-term with all but a month suspended that Baugh had given him. Earlier in September, Judge Baugh caused further outrage by claiming that his paltry sentence ‘actually upped’ the convicted rapist’s ‘debt to society’. In a written addendum to his sentence handed down in Billings District Court Monday the judge stated: ‘Had the defendant pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury three years ago, he would have had a basis from which to argue for a minimum sentence.’ Victim Cherice Moralez committed suicide on February 6, 2010. She shot herself in her mother’s bed just three weeks before her 17th birthday. Teacher: Rambold, 54, lost his house, his job, his teaching license and his wife as a result of the charges. His lawyer suggested, and the judge seemed to agree on Monday, that he had been 'punished enough' According to her mother, Auliea Hanlon, the pending trial of teacher Stacey Rambold - 49 when the rapes were committed - and trauma of the abuse were ‘major factors’ in her daughter’s death. Speaking to MailOnline Mrs Hanlon said that her daughter had been ‘in hell,’ shunned by classmates and bullied following the revelations of the abuse. Her death complicated the prosecution of former Billings Senior High School teacher Rambold, now 54, who was arrested and charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent in 2008. Prosecutors who had sought to put Rambold behind bars instead settled for a three-year deferred prosecution. According to the terms of the agreement the case would be dismissed after this term if Rambold pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent and entered a three-stage sex offender treatment program. But in December 2012 the case was revived when it transpired that Rambold had violated the terms of the program, having contact with minors and engaging in a sexual relationship [not with a minor] without informing his counselor. In his written explanation Judge Baugh maintained that these violations were ‘not significant’. He stated: ‘There were violations of the treatment program, but involved no violence, no inappropriate sexual conduct, and no new criminal activity. ‘Defendant’s old treatment provider recommended that the Defendant still be assessed as a low risk offender and treatable in the community. Critic: Auliea Hanlon, Cherice's . mother criticized the judge's apology as 'meaningless' ‘Knowing that the Defendant had enrolled in another sexual offender treatment program, the Court is faced with deciding if the Defendant should go to prison for relatively minor infractions.’ Judge Baugh went on to state that there was other information that could not be publicly released but had played a part in the court’s decision: a July 2013 pre-sentence report from the Department of Corrections, an August 2009 psychological/psychosocial evaluation of Rambold, and two interviews with the victim in 2009. Judge Baugh was forced to apologize for his comments in court, in which he claimed that the victim was ‘older than her chronological years’ and ‘in control of the situation’ in which she was raped in Rambold’s car, his then marital home and on school premises. Similarly he drew fierce criticism when appearing to diminish the crime as, in defending his sentence, he said: ‘I think people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape ... but it wasn’t this forcible, beat up rape.’ In his addendum he conceded: ‘Rape under any circumstances is a horrible violent offense. Some involved physical beatings, broken bones. Others, as here, involve young victims legally not capable of consenting. All are traumatic and all are crimes.’ Though he stated that he believed a prison sentence to be ‘appropriate’ in this case Judge Baugh   stood by his decision to suspend all but 31 days of Rambold’s 15 years plus one day’s credit for time served. He said: ‘Based on all circumstances, the Court upped Mr Rambold’s debt to society from the almost expired three years Deferred Prosecution Agreement to the 15 years suspended sentence.’ Rambold’s sentence puts him on probation for 15 years and requires him to finish sex-offender treatment and to register as a convicted sex offender. Yellowstone County prosecutor Scott Twito is still reviewing the sentence with a view to finding some legal grounds for appeal, and Judge Baugh’s explanation and defense of his decision will do little to silence the voices of those clamoring for his resignation. 'Bad form': Judge Baugh is running for re-election next year. Protestors vowed to ensure he doesn't receive a fifth term . Tens of thousands have signed an online petition calling for him to be removed from his post and yesterday hundreds protested his sentence outside Billings District Court House. Speaking to MailOnline Cherry’s mother said: ‘Rambold took away everything beautiful in my life and he just gets to walk away. He confessed. He did it. ‘With this sentence the judge just lets everyone off – he lets the school off and he lets him off.’","Montana teacher Stacey Rambold, 54, was sentenced to 30 days in prison for raping a 14-year-old girl last month .

Lazy: Two thirds of Brits are putting themselves at risk of heart disease and strokes by not doing the recommended daily amount of exercise . Two thirds of Britons are putting their health at risk by doing less than the recommended amount of exercise. The World Heart Federation says 67 per cent fail to achieve the suggested 30 minutes a day of brisk walking, while 29 per cent do less than nine minutes a day, putting themselves at risk of premature death. It warns that inactivity increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. A study by the group ahead of World Heart Day on Sunday suggests Britain is among the least active countries. In contrast, 48 per cent of people in Spain walk briskly for more than 30 minutes a day, while 54 per cent of Brazilians and Indians do the recommended amount. Meanwhile, the least active part of Britain is the Midlands, with 74 per cent not doing enough and a staggering 35 per cent walking for less than nine minutes per day. Scots are the most active - 39 per cent do the recommended amount of exercise and one in six do more than an hour a day. The study found one in three Brits questioned had no idea how much time they spend walking. The World Heart Federation is now urging people to increase their physical activity to protect their health. Chief science officer Dr Kathryn Taubert said: 'Awareness is the first step to a healthy heart. Paying attention to how much we walk should be as simple as watching what we eat. 'On World Heart Day, we are urging people to take action to protect their hearts. 'By reaching the recommended minimum 30 . minutes of  moderate exercise, which includes brisk walking, at least . five days a week, many premature deaths can be prevented.’ The World Heart Federation recommends 30 minutes of brisk walking a day. Spain, India and Brazil are all ahead of Britain in the exercise stakes . The study also found men are the lazier sex, with 72 per cent doing less than the required 30 minutes of ‘brisk walking’ five days a week, compared to 63 per cent of women. Having children may encourage us to get out and walk more, as 37 per cent of those with young kids do at least 30 minutes of exercise each day, compared to just 32 per cent without. The World Heart Federation and healthcare group Bupa are launching a free walking app in a bid to encourage people to get moving.","Brits are failing to achieve 30 minutes of brisk walking each day .

Five-year-old Sumatran tiger Melati gave birth to the cub on Sunday evening after a six-minute labour. The pregnancy, which lasted around 105 days, was kept secret by zookeepers who kept a careful watch on the first-time mother through hidden cameras so they would not disturb her. Scroll down for video . Watchful eye: Hidden cameras captured the moment Sumatran tiger Melati gave birth at London Zoo . Up on its feet: The cub is the first to be born at the zoo for 17 years and staff said they were 'over the moon' The cub was born six months after the opening of the new 'tiger territory' at London Zoo, designed to encourage breeding of the critically endangered sub-species of tiger. Zookeeper Paul Kybett said everyone at the zoo was 'over the moon' about the birth. 'We were nervous about the pregnancy, as it was Melati's first cub and we didn't know how she'd react. When it came to her due date, we were all watching our monitors with bated breath. 'The actual birth happened very quickly and Melati's maternal instincts kicked in immediately as she started licking the cub all over and it soon began wriggling around - we couldn't have asked for a smoother birth.

'It's still very early days, so we're leaving Melati to take care of her adorable baby, and our cameras allow us to watch them both from a distance. 'So far she's proving to be a doting mum,' he said. Zookeepers do not know the sex of the cub, which is in the exhibit's cubbing den with its mother. The zoo plans to keep the baby out of the public eye for several weeks until Melati is ready to show the youngster off to the world. The cub is the grandchild of the zoo's last tiger cub, Hari, the father of Melati.  The cub's father is five-year-old Jae Jae, who is playing no part in taking care of the new arrival.","Sumatran tiger Melati gave birth to a cub on Sunday after six-minute labour .

With her striking red hair and model’s cheekbones, it is impossible to imagine that  pop star Carmit Bachar as anything other than beautiful. As a member of the international chart-topping band Pussycat Dolls, she won legions of fans and wowed audiences around the world. But her face – and life – has  not always been so perfect. For Carmit was born with a cleft lip and palate, a common birth defect that leaves babies with the upper lip and the roof of the mouth  split apart. It took a string of gruelling operations to correct, meaning that Carmit’s childhood was punctuated by annual surgery from the age of just six months until she was 16. In between the difficult recovery periods, she found herself bullied for the way she looked. But her  pop career gave her the chance to show people that physical imperfections can be overcome. Carmit took to telling audiences about her cleft lip and palate during performances while she stood on stage with bandmates including  X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger. ‘I’d say, “Hi, I’m Carmit. You may not know I was born with a birth defect but growing up I felt different and not pretty. I’m sure everyone has something that makes them feel different, and I invite you to embrace that because that’s what makes you special and unique.” ‘There’d be this huge cheer and  I’d get fan mail saying thank you because this person or their daughter had a cleft lip or palate.’ The 38-year-old adds: ‘People need to know that beauty isn’t just on the outside – it’s on the inside. It’s kind of crazy that I was in a pop group that revolved around image when for so long I had this defect that could have held me back.’ The condition is now rarely seen  in children in the UK because it is  corrected soon after birth, but it remains the most common facial birth defect. One in every 700 babies in the UK is born with a cleft. The type and severity varies widely. Some are born with either a cleft lip or a  cleft palate, but around half of those affected have both. It was Carmit’s love of performing that helped her become resilient.  By the age of ten, she was having lessons in dance, piano and drama, and she also took up rhythmic gymnastics. Eventually she was selected for the US national team. But despite countless operations, her face remained marked throughout adolescence – and she was even told by one talent agent not to get her hopes up about a career on stage because of her appearance. Scarred youth: Carmit, pictured as a toddler, went through annual operations throughout her childhood and suffered from bullying as she grew up . After a major operation at the age of eight, which took a piece of bone from her thigh to build the hard palate in the top of her mouth, Carmit had to have more surgery to correct the appearance of her scar. ‘I’d be so excited, thinking this operation would fix it, and then I would be disappointed as my lips still looked different,’ she recalls. Carmit also developed an underbite, a common complication of  cleft lip and palate as jaw growth can be disturbed by the recurrent surgery. Her underbite worsened from the age of 12 until it reached the point where she didn’t recognise herself, and at 16 she underwent major surgery to correct that too. The repeated operations meant that she had to learn how to use  her voice again. ‘I had to relearn where your tongue is supposed to  go and where the different sounds are. I taught myself how to whistle again too. But there are still sounds I can’t make.’ Carmit’s final operation took place when she was 18, when bone was taken from her head to build a bridge in her nose. Thankfully, treatments have improved dramatically since then. Nigel Mercer, consultant cleft surgeon at the South West regional cleft unit in Bristol, says: ‘The UK leads the world in cleft care, and while 30 years ago children would have 17 or 18 operations, we avoid that now.’ Doll domination: Carmit, far right, with her Pussycat Doll band-mates Kimberly Wyatt, Melody Thornton, Jessica Sutta, Nicole Scherzinger and Ashley Roberts at the 2005 MTV Europe Music Awards . These days, there are only three ‘must-have’ operations during childhood. The first is  a lip repair, usually done at three months, which also fixes the hard palate in the roof of the mouth. The second is a soft- palate repair at the back of the throat at about nine months. Then, at around eight years,  bone is taken from the patient’s hip or shin and put into the gap  in the top of the mouth. Orthodontic work is needed in the early teenage years to align the teeth properly. The condition may also cause ear problems – children under three need monitoring for glue ear, which can affect hearing and impede speech. Half of all British children with the condition will need speech therapy. A final operation can take place on the nose between the ages of 18 and 20 as patients sometimes have problems breathing through the nostrils. Despite the excellent treatment, cleft lip and palate – which can  be detected in foetuses at the 20-week scan – remains grounds for abortion in the UK. Carmit was horrified to find that was the case. ‘I can’t believe a doctor would perform an abortion when this is correctable with no residual physical disability, especially now we’ve come so far in this field,’ she says. She did not even take the cleft palate scan when she was pregnant with her daughter, Keala Rose, who is now 18 months. ‘I was terrified she’d have to go through what I went through, so I was overjoyed when I looked at her for the first time. She was amazing – perfect in every way.’ Carmit is an ambassador for the Cleft Lip and Palate Association.

The figures reveal exercise has a direct correlation with the risk of high blood pressure . Little more than half an hour of exercise every day could cut your risk of high blood pressure by almost a fifth, say researchers. Doing just four hours a week of physical activity during leisure time could make the difference between a healthy blood pressure and having to take drugs for life. New findings from the American Heart Association (AHA) suggest the more recreational physical activity you get, the more you are protected from developing high blood pressure. Researchers pooled results from 13 studies on the effects of physical activity on blood pressure in a report in the journal Hypertension. The studies involved 136,846 people in the United States, Europe or East Asia who initially had healthy blood pressure. More than 15,600 later developed high blood pressure during follow-up periods ranging from two to 45 years. People who exercised more than four hours per week in their leisure time had a 19 per cent lower risk of high blood pressure than those who exercised less than one hour per week. People who had one to three hours per week of leisure exercise had an 11 per cent lower risk than those with under an hour of activity. An estimated 16 million people in the UK have high blood pressure, including the third who do not know they have it. It is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Every day there are 350 preventable strokes or heart attacks in the UK due to high blood pressure. A high blood pressure reading is one that exceeds 140/90 millimetres of mercury (mm Hg). The first figure, the systolic pressure, corresponds to the ‘surge’ that occurs with each heart beat. The condition typically has no symptoms, so it goes undetected or untreated in many people. In developed countries like the UK, the lifetime risk of developing high blood pressure is now 90 per cent and six million Britons take drugs to control it - usually for life. People with hypertension - the medical term - are routinely advised to change their lifestyle and eat less salt, lose weight, drink less alcohol, eat more fruit and vegetables and exercise more. 16 million people in the UK have high blood pressure, including the third who do not know they have it . Difference: People who exercised four hours a week noticed almost 20 per cent lower risk in the experiment . But the latest research show the benefits in preventing blood pressure from rising are much bigger than expected. Dr Wei Ma, study co-author and associate professor at the Shandong University School of Public Health in Jinan, China, said ‘Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular and kidney disease -- thus, it is important to prevent and control hypertension. ‘To try to lower your risk of high blood pressure, you should exercise more in your leisure time.’ Researchers didn’t find a solid link between physical exertion at work and risk of high blood pressure. Dr Bo Xi, research co-author and lecturer at the Shandong University School of Public Health in Jinan, China, said health guidelines advising more exercise don’t distinguish between activity at work and for leisure, but ‘given the new findings, perhaps they should.’ Experts said the findings do not confirm the link but show that 'ten minutes here or there will count' Physical activity on the job, such as farm or industrial work, can involve exertion like heavy lifting, prolonged standing and repetitive tasks. The researchers said recreational exercise may affect several factors tied to high blood pressure -- helping people keep off extra pounds, improving poor insulin sensitivity or reducing the blood vessels’ resistance to blood flow. However, the findings don’t prove that taking exercise can prevent hypertension because people who exercise for fun may have healthier lifestyles, warned Dr Xi. In the UK people are advised to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise including playing sport, running or aerobics every week. Three out of four Britons fail to achieve this. Doireann Maddock, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘The benefits of physical activity on heart health are already well known and this study goes a long way to reinforcing that evidence. ‘Current guidelines recommend that adults do at least two and a half hours of moderate intensity activity each week. 'You could aim for a minimum of 30 minutes on five days a week, but even ten minutes here or there will count. ‘Keeping active doesn’t necessarily have to mean joining a gym either. A brisk lunchtime walk with a friend or getting off the bus a few stops earlier can make a difference, too.’","New report shows the more physical activity, the more you are protected .

Statins taken by millions of Britons could lead to  memory loss, researchers have warned. In tests, one of the widely- prescribed drugs cut the ability to form new memories and recall information. The medication, called pravastatin, was found to have an adverse effect on rats. Bristol University researchers say their study tallies with reports of statin patients feeling ‘fuzzy-headed’ and ‘befuddled’. The team also said it was ‘highly likely’ other statins affected memory loss. But other experts dismissed the research and insisted the benefits of statins outweigh any side-effects. Statins, which lower levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol in the blood, are the most widely prescribed drugs in Britain and are taken by up to eight million people. Used to treat those at risk of heart problems and strokes, they are credited with saving thousands of lives a year and some doctors believe that everyone over the age of 50 should be given them. However, a range of documented side-effects includes muscle and liver problems, blurred vision, fatigue and difficulty sleeping, leading some  doctors to argue they should be reserved only for those at risk of heart problems. The Bristol neuroscientists looked at the effect of two of the most commonly prescribed statins – pravastatin and atorvastatin – on the memory of rats. Rodents given pravastatin found it more difficult to learn where a sugary treat was hidden, they discovered. They also struggled to recall an object they had seen before. This behaviour was likened by researchers to someone knowing that they have car keys, but not being able to remember where they left them. It is thought statins may be reducing levels of cholesterol in the brain or affecting its nerve cells directly. A quarter of the body’s cholesterol is found inside the head, where it aids the transmission of signals between brain cells. The . problems vanished shortly after the animals were taken off pravastatin. Atorvastatin did not affect memory, according to a report in the . journal PLoS ONE. It is . unclear why pravastatin affected memory, as the drug is not thought to . be able to cross into the brain and atorvastatin is. Pravastatin (pictured), with the brand name Pravachol, has adverse effects on working and recognition memory. However, atorvastatin, with the brand name Lipitor, does not have any effect . The . Bristol researchers said patients on statins should take note of the . findings and warned that it is ‘highly likely’ other statins may also . affect memory. Professor . Neil Marrion said: ‘If you notice you are suffering cognitive problems . or people around you  recognise you are suffering problems, go back to . your GP and ask for a different statin and you might find the problem . disappears.’ Others have described the advice as ‘total overkill’. Consultant . cardiologist Kausik Ray, a member of the British Cardiovascular . Society, said large-scale studies on frail and elderly people had failed . to find any evidence that statins damage memory. ‘I don’t do rat research, I do large-scale population research,’ he said. ‘There is a reason that people are on statins – and that is to reduce the risk of heart disease and strokes.’ The . drugs watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory products Agency . (MHRA), said memory loss is already listed as a potential side-effect . of statins. A spokesman . added: ‘The benefits of statins are well established and outweigh the . risk of side-effects in most patients who take them.

The RCN explained many nurses questioned reported sickness absence policies at their place of work were so punitive they had no alternative but to attend work despite feeling unwell . Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the RCN, said: 'In the aftermath of the Francis Inquiry, it is clearer than ever that working cultures in the NHS and beyond have a direct and serious effect on the level of care that staff can provide to patients. 'Our whole care system is currently facing the huge challenge of delivering care at a time of increased demand and scant resource. This is the reality which nurses face in every working day. 'There is much that managers and employers can do, and should be doing, to support staff and keep patients safe. 'By ensuring there are enough staff to deliver care, and enabling staff to raise concerns safely, the positive working culture which exists in many places could be the reality everywhere. 'Worryingly, this report shows that rather than an environment which supports staff, some employers are instead adopting panic behaviours. 'Staff report being intimidated and blamed, and feel they have no way of speaking out about threats to patient care. Individual nurses are clearly going the extra mile to make sure the job is done, however, the risk of burnout is very real, and very widespread.' A Department of Health spokeswoman said: 'The staff working for our NHS are our health service's most precious resource. Nurses are working extremely hard and continue to provide a high quality of care in the face of rising healthcare demands. 'We want to support nurses as much as possible and are already investing in technology and training, while looking at cutting bureaucracy by a third to allow nurses to focus on patients and not paperwork. 'Recent reports have shown clearly that we need safe numbers on wards and a supportive culture in the NHS. We have already introduced some major changes, such as a Chief Inspector who will take action on staffing levels.'","Poll finds 80% of nurses have gone to work in the past year when feeling ill .

"By . Lucy Elkins . PUBLISHED: . 16:54 EST, 30 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:04 EST, 30 September 2013 . When rower Sir Steve Redgrave won his fifth Olympic gold medal in Sydney he had a secret stash on-board with him. Sellotaped to the inside of his boat were some sachets of sugar. This wasn't just in case he got hungry. It was there if his blood sugar dropped too low. For just three years earlier, in 1997, Steve, who at the time was an impressive 6ft 5in and 16st, was told he had type 2 diabetes. 'I suddenly thought, “What if something happens out there” - sugar was the only thing I could grab quickly,' he recalls. Heroic: Redgrave saluting his support after winning his fifth consecutive gold medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. Sir Steve stashed sugar on board with him . 'As it turned out I didn't need it and I forgot all about it until the boat was packed up and brought back to a museum here, and the guys who unwrapped it called me asking why there was sugar there.' Type 2 diabetes is normally associated with obesity and a couch potato lifestyle - not heroic athleticism. Even now no one can tell for sure why he developed it - but it could be that it was unlucky genes. 'My paternal grandfather was diagnosed with it in his late 70s but died soon after of an unrelated matter,' says Sir Steve. 'It seemed to skip a generation, because neither of my parents got it - it just seems to be me.' There are 3.8 million people with diabetes in Britain and 90 per cent have type 2 diabetes like Sir Steve. While type 1 is caused when the cells that produce the hormone insulin are destroyed, type 2 diabetes occurs when the insulin produced becomes less effective - normally as a result of being overweight and inactive. The body needs more and more insulin to try to keep blood sugar within a normal range. Although the biggest risk factor for type 2 diabetes is weight, genes can also have an important role. 'Genetics are more important in defining your risk of type 2 diabetes than in type 1 diabetes,' says Professor Anthony Barnett, emeritus professor of medicine and consultant physician, University of Birmingham and Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust. 'If one parent has type 2, then you have a 30 per cent chance of developing it. If both parents do, then that risk is 50 per cent. It is possible to develop type 2 diabetes even if you are of a normal weight - just because of the genetics you inherited.' Diabetic: Sir Steve's paternal grandfather was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, but the only other person in the Redgrave family to get it thus far has been Steve . Diabetes UK estimates that as many as 850,000 people have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes and seven million people in this country are at risk of type 2 diabetes and don't know it. 'Unfortunately, at the moment 50 per cent of people have a complication of the disease by the time they are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes,' says Libby Dowling, a clinical adviser to charity Diabetes UK. The condition causes complications such as nerve damage, heart disease, kidney damage, stroke, sight loss and amputation - diabetes is the leading cause of amputations and blindness in Britain. And these don't just strike people who fail to manage their condition; they affect even the most vigilant of patients. A few years ago Sir Steve lost a friend to the disease. 'He stepped on a thorn and his foot went black and rather than tell anyone he kept his socks on at night so that even his wife wouldn't see,' he says. He had to have his lower leg amputated and ultimately it killed him.' Professor Barnett adds: 'Unfortunately most people - even if their condition is well controlled - will have some complications.' Now Sir Steve is just starting to suffer from complications. 'I get my eyes checked every year,' he says. 'I am told there is just the beginnings of a slight change to my eyesight.' This damage is thought to have been caused by high blood sugar levels damaging vessels in the eye. 'I'm not aware of it yet and it's nothing that will cause any problems in the near future, but it's something that I need to be aware of,' he adds. But he does have signs of nerve damage. 'I go to see a diabetic specialist every six months and have tests on my feet, and they are not as sensitive as they used to be,' says Sir Steve. 'There's a slight sensation of numbness - a bit like when the anaesthetic wears off after you have been to the dentist. 'I feel that if you stuck something sharp in my toe, I would not feel it as keenly as if you stuck it into my hand. Complications of this are something I worry about, but I think it's better to keep aware of them.' The disease tends to come on slowly and many ignore the early symptoms. 'Most of the early symptoms are vague and non-specific - such as increased thirst, passing more urine than usual, excessive tiredness and slow-healing cuts and grazes,' says Libby Dowling. Sir Steve was diagnosed 16 years ago after feeling unusually thirsty one day after training. 'I drank around four to five pints of fluid and still didn't feel as if my thirst was quenched and I thought, “That's a bit strange”,' he recalls. 'I get my eyes checked every year. I am told there is just the beginnings of a slight change to my eyesight. I'm . not aware of it yet and it's nothing that will cause any problems in . the near future, but it's something that I need to be aware of.' He'd been given dip sticks to check for sugar in the urine as part of a team medical check. 'They'd always come back negative. I thought I'd check it again and this time it was positive - so I phoned my wife, who is a doctor, and she said, “You better go to your doctor.” ' A further blood test confirmed that his blood sugar reading was sky high - 32 - more than three times what it should be. He saw a specialist later that day. 'I was thinking that my career was over. I was being quite matter of fact about it - I thought, well I have got four gold medals, that's pretty good,' says Sir Steve. 'Then I went to see the specialist who said, “I can see no reason why you can't continue with what you want to do for three years”. What I didn't know was he had no idea how we were going to do that.' Normally, diabetics are advised to follow regular eating patterns and try a standard low glycaemic index (GI) diet - i.e., foods which release energy slowly. However, Sir Steve's lifestyle made this extremely difficult. 'I needed around 7,000 calories a day to keep me going through four or five training sessions a day and used to eat a lot of carbohydrates, and things like doughnuts,' he says. 'On this new low-GI diet I would wake up feeling great, then my energy would suddenly run out - it was like switching a light off. So my specialist put me back on my old diet.' This meant experimenting with his insulin levels - he injected eight to ten times a day after meals - and it took months before he got it right. While training in South Africa he hit a low. 'There were 16 of us there and each session we did I was coming bottom out of everyone - I had never  been bottom in my life before. Fatigued: On Sir Steve's low-GI diet, he would wake up feeling great but then his energy would suddenly run out . 'I called my wife who had wanted me to retire after the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and said, “I can't do this, I'm coming home”. But she surprised me by saying, “Yes you can, we will find a way”.' Sure enough he did - with the sugar stash just in case. But after winning his fifth gold at the 2000 Games he quit professional sport and had to change the way he managed his diabetes again. 'It was like starting all over again,' he says. 'I wasn't burning off the blood sugar like I had been and I had to take a lot more insulin.' Six years ago he switched to a pump which is occasionally used by type 2 diabetics. The size of a pack of cards, it is usually worn on a belt and contains insulin which runs down a tube with a needle on the end. The needle is inserted into a fatty part of the body - in Sir Steve's case the abdomen. He inserts the needle himself. 'It's great - you only have to inject yourself once every three days when you change the insulin and you can take if off when you go into the shower,' he says. Sir Steve's attitude to his diabetes has always been 'it lives with me, I don't live with it'. He says: 'You don't have to be wrapped up in cotton wool. Yes there are jobs you can't do - you can't be a pilot and you can't join the Armed Forces - but you can still reach your goal like I did. 'OK, I would prefer not to be checking my blood sugar all the time and wearing this pump, but I have no choice - I just have to get on with it.'

Faisal Latif (pictured) has been jailed 21 years after starting the fire which killed a mother and her 16-year-old son in a dispute over unpaid rent . A landlord who killed a mother and her teenager son in a house fire has been jailed after fleeing the UK and going on the run for 21 years in America. Faisal Latif, 44, fled the country after starting the fire which killed Marilyn Cook, 40, and son Nicky, 16, on April 9, 1992, following a dispute over unpaid rent. Nicky died after an explosion gutted the family’s home in Middleport, Stoke-on-Trent, while Marilyn passed away in hospital nine days later. Her partner Stephen Hillman suffered smoke inhalation and burns in the fire but survived. He died of an unrelated condition in 2006 aged 55. Latif escaped to Pakistan less than 38 hours after the fire and assumed a new identity before eventually settling down in America. He escaped capture for 21 years until January this year when police used fingerprints and a driving licence photo to trace him to a suburb in Dallas, Texas. Officers found Latif owned several businesses and had even married, though his new wife had no idea about his past crimes. In February this year, he was extradited to the UK and appeared in court charged with causing the deaths of Ms Cook and her son. He pleaded guilty yesterday at Stafford Crown Court to two charges of manslaughter and a third charge of arson with intent to endanger life. He was sentenced to 15 years for manslaughter and 10 years for arson with intent to endanger life, to run concurrently. Marilyn Cook (left) and her 16-year-old son Nicky (right) died following the fire at their home in Middleport, Stoke-on-Trent . Despite spreading ten litres of fuel around the home, Faisal said he didn¿t realise how fierce the inferno at the house (pictured) would be . Jailing Latif, Judge Simon Tonking told him: 'Having set fire to the house you fled in the hope that you would never be brought to justice. 'Members of Marilyn and Nicholas Cook’s family suffered very gravely as a result of your killing. Most grievous is the fact Marilyn’s daughter and brothers saw her in the terrible physical state. 'Marilyn and Nicholas are two people who are still sorely missed by their family who until today have had to endure the emptiness and uncertainty of a case unresolved.' The court heard Latif, from Manchester, had repeatedly tried to force Marilyn and Stephen out of the house due to rent arrears and allegations of alcoholism. Speaking outside court after the verdict, Ms Cook's daughter Maxine Podmore (centre), 41, gave an emotional statement on behalf of the family . He changed the lock on the property’s . back door days before the fire and kept the key so he could enter at . night and douse it in petrol. Despite spreading ten litres of fuel around the home, Faisal said he didn’t realise how fierce the inferno would be. Neighbours were woken by an explosion on the street at 2.30am, and fire engines arrived three minutes later. Nicky Cook died after the explosion at the family home in 1992 . When they got into the home crews found Nicky was already dead, while unconscious Marilyn was pulled from the home and rushed to hospital. She never regained consciousness and died on April 18 - nine days after the fire. Stephen Hillman recovered from his injuries but died in 2006. Speaking outside court after the verdict, Ms Cook's daughter Maxine Podmore, 41, gave an emotional statement on behalf of the family. She said: 'No sentence given to this man could ever bring my mum and brother back and to me it will always be murder. It is a small piece of comfort knowing that someone has finally been made accountable. 'He deprived me of a mum and brother. All those precious moments we should have shared were taken away from me that night. 'They never saw my wedding or my children, and my children and their children never knew them. 'I suffered mentally and emotionally and still do today. My dad lost a son and the chance of being a grandad. 'No prison sentence can ever bring them back and there’s not a day that goes by when we do not think about them. Let’s hope now that Marilyn and Nicky Cook can rest in peace.' Chief Inspector Sarah Wainwright, of Staffordshire Police, said: 'In 2010 attention shifted to the U.S. and officers came by information that linked a possible suspect to an area of Dallas with the name Faiz Ali. 'Following months of work, Ali was confirmed to be Latif and was identified by his photo driving licence and fingerprints. We were then able to go for extradition. Ms Cook's partner partner Stephen Hillman (pictured) suffered smoke inhalation and burns in the fire but survived. He died of an unrelated condition in 2006 aged 55 . 'He may have created a new life with a new identity, living thousands of miles away from the devastation he caused in Middleport, but he is now starting the sentence he deserves.' Kiernan Cunningham, from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'In 1990, Faisal Latif purchased 25 Travers Street, and began to rent it out. 'Two years later, his final tenants would be Marilyn Cook, her partner and her 16-year-old son Nicholas. Rent arrears accrued and as a result Latif decided to evict them. 'But rather than instigating legal proceedings, he sought to use illegal methods, asking acquaintances for their assistance in evicting them. 'When those acquaintances refused to help, Latif turned to more sinister tactics with tragic consequences.'","Faisal Latif fled UK after starting fire which killed a mother and her son .

The Kenyan mall massacre has sparked fears the atrocity was a warm-up for an attack on Britain, with David Cameron calling for 'permanent vigilance' against terrorism in the UK. The Prime Minister said he has no intelligence of plans for an 'imminent' attack in Britain but acknowledged that there was a 'worry' that British-based Somalis trained by the extremist Al-Shabaab group in the east African country might return to the UK with the intention of committing a similar atrocity. He said that he had chaired meetings of the Government's Cobra emergency contingency committee over the past week to discuss the implications of the Westgate mall attack. Concerns: Prime Minister David Cameron today admitted there was a 'worry' that British-based Somalis trained by extremist group Al-Shabaab in Kenya may return to the UK with the intention of carrying out a similar attack to the Kenyan mall massacre . Mall massacre: A soldier carries a child to safety as armed police hunt the gunmen who went on a brutal shooting spree at Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi on September 21 . At least 67 people, including six Britons, were killed after a group of militant gunmen launched an attack in the upmarket shopping centre in Nairobi on September 21. Contingency plans have already been put in place in the period following the similar attacks in Mumbai, India, in 2008, he said. Mr Cameron told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'We have been looking at this for a long time because of the appalling attack that happened in Mumbai in India. 'I have personally chaired a whole series of meetings years ago, but again actually this week, to check that we have got everything in place to prepare for those sorts of attacks. 'We don't have intelligence that something is about to happen, but it pays to be very, very prepared, very, very cautious, and to work out we have everything in place we can to deal with awful events like this.' Plans: But Cameron told Andrew Marr on his breakfast show, pictured, that contingency plans for such an attack were put in place following the Mumbai attacks in India in 2008 . Asked whether he was concerned that British-based Somalis might export terror from the African state to the UK, Mr Cameron said: 'There is always a worry of that and there is a hotbed of terrorism in Somalia that spills over into other countries, and we are concerned about that and follow that. 'What it shows I think is that we have to keep going against Islamist extremism, whether that is people that are home-grown in our own country or whether it is extremism that is fomenting either on the Horn of Africa or in West Africa or in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 'It goes to this whole argument about why we need well-funded intelligence services, why we need to be engaged in the world, we need to share intelligence with others and why we have to be permanently vigilant. 'I take these responsibilities incredibly seriously, I chair the Cobra meetings myself and I make sure that everything from ambulance to fire to police, that everything is prepared. 'We don't have intelligence about anything imminent, but of course when that Mumbai attack happened and you see what happened in Kenya, any responsible government would look at its own processes and procedures, and say how would we cope with something like that?'

Judy Weaver worked tirelessly to get to the bottom of what happened on the rainy June day in 2005 when her son Ronnie Johnson, 34, was fatally injured. She was told he died after falling off his bike and hitting his head on a curb but that explanation didn't add up. This week, thanks to her detective work, Jason Gailey, has been arrested and charged with Johnson's murder. Police now say he struck Johnson in the head with a handgun when he tried to stop a fight.

Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. 'I'm just kind of numb. I'm very much relieved,' Weaver told ABC News. Eyewitness accounts that are now considered to be false claimed Johnson died after he was doing tricks on his bike and slipped, hitting his head on the curb. But Weaver inspected the bike and saw no scratches or damage, and also learned there was no curb in the area that her son could have slammed his head against. Suspicious, Weaver managed to pinpoint Gailey as a suspect just days after the incident, while her son was still clinging to life in a coma. Weaver and her daughter, Deborah . Murray, spread the word that Johnson was recovering in hospital and . giving details about what actually happened. 'This is how we got people to talk... Ronnie didn't actually speak to anybody,' Weaver told ABC News. Nine days later, he was taken off life support and passed away on July 6, 2005. Fight: Eyewitness accounts that are now considered to be false claimed Ronnie Johnson, left, died after he was doing tricks on his bike and slipped but police believe Jason Gailey, right, hit him in the head with a handgun . But the ploy worked and Weaver got a partial confession from Gailey who admitted to hitting Johnson with his fist, though he said it was an accident. He added that 'Ronnie was getting back up to beat him up, so he ran.' 'I think he was trying to deflect, pinning all fault on the others,' Murray said. Weaver went straight to the police with the information but they refused to believe her son's death may not have been an accident. Determined not to give up, Weaver and Murray carried on their own investigation for the next eight years, keeping careful notes. 'We worked good as a team,' Weaver . said. She said once she had done the leg work, Murray helped . her find the names, numbers, and locations, necessary to piece it all together. But . the break they needed came in June 2012 when Lt.

Murder: Gailey, pictured left and right, has been charged with second degree murder. He has yet to be arraigned and has not entered a plea . Relief: Weaver is relieved that her tireless detective work has paid off and Gailey will be tried . Without realizing who he was, she began talking about her son's case to the officer, stirring his interest and the investigation was soon reopened. 'I knew if we got the right people, eventually it would be solved. It's getting the right person and eight years later, we got that right person,' Weaver told ABC News. 'I never gave up.' Now with the cold case reopened, police determined that the witnesses who said they saw Ronnie fall off his bike had changed their stories. One critical witness had suffered a stroke in the intervening years, and the health scare compelled him to come forward with the truth, feeling he owed it to himself and his family. Police now say there was a fight between Gailey and another man identified as Harry 'Cowboy' Taylor and Johnson was trying to stop it when Gailey struck him in the head with a handgun and fell to the ground, hitting the concrete. 'My son was a good Samaritan and he lost his life,' Weaver said. 'If he had to lose his life, I'm proud he lost his life doing a good thing. I think he is looking down on us and just so proud that we never gave up, that we got to the bottom of this. I feel him around me, and when I see him again, we will rejoice.'

Members of a high school marching band in Texas experienced a rather unfortunate, but extremely funny, pile-up during a recent performance. The six sousaphone players from Lake Travis High School in Austin were walking backwards while playing at the same time when one of them tripped over his own feet and fell. Before: The band is playing to their heart's content, until... One man down!: The second-to-last sousaphone player trips over his own feet as they are walking backwards . Whoops: The next player goes down . Third domino: And then another trips over the first two who are on the ground . All six: One by one they trip over each other . And they all fall down: Six players and their brass instruments on the ground . Scramble: They quickly grab their instruments and compose themselves before running back into the line . Wait for me!: One player is seen running off quickly to join the others . Because they couldn’t see where they were going, five other sousaphone players tripped over him and each other like domino pieces. And down they went, ending up in one giant heap of brass instruments and band uniforms. No one was hurt in the incident, and they are seen jumping up and running back into formation within seconds. The six were part of the Lake Travis Cavalier Band, which performs at all the school’s football games and other events. The sousaphone is a brass instrument related to the tuba and helicon.

In 1940, when Ralph Miliband was swearing to be ‘faithful to the workers’ cause’ while enjoying life in this country, which offered him a home and safety, my beautiful, brave mother, as a young woman, was starting two years of slavery in the Soviet Union which people with the professor’s ideological views had endorsed. She was taken away from Poland — along with about two million other Poles — and forced to work in terrible conditions in the fields and forests in northern Russia, near Archangel. Fortunately, she was blessed with courage and intelligence, and with the kindness and generosity extended to her by ordinary Russians, she survived. Family: Ed Miliband and father Ralph Miliband, pictured in London in 1989 . In her view, anyone who thinks Marxism is the answer has either never experienced life within that system or is, quite simply, mad. Danuta Okarmus, London W5. The Mail says Ed Miliband’s father hated the Royal Family, the Church and the Army, and wanted a workers’ revolution. What he probably meant was he hated the Royal Family for the fake tyrannical institution it has always been, and the Church, as he was an atheist. And not the Army personnel, but rather the military armament complex that sucks the wealth out of all but a few, as even Eisenhower warned. And what is wrong with a workers’ revolution? It’s long overdue. I don’t like Ed Miliband, but I am now an admirer of his father, who would certainly get my seal of approval. Pete Cresswell, Enniskillen, Co. Fermanagh. The Mail was quite right to highlight the nature of Ed Miliband’s father. The Left describes him as a ‘socialist’. He was a Marxist. The nature of Miliband’s parents is relevant. The Left does not hesitate to attack the Tories as posh, and their parentage and background. Attacking the Mail for doing what the Left does is pure hypocrisy. But generally the Left hates having done to it what it does to others. It hates having its tactics used on it. United: Both Labour leader Ed, left, and his brother David Miliband, right, have defended their father . Further, to attack the Mail for the first Lord Rothermere’s supposed attitudes in the 1930s is intellectually disgusting and shows the low level of politics in this country. Leftist bullies cannot be allowed to prevail. Finally, as a Jew, I cringe at Ralph Miliband being called ‘Jewish’. Jewish Marxists are among the worst enemies the Jewish people have. Marxists were among the worst persecutors of Jews and Judaism. Karl Marx himself was author of one of the worst anti-semitic rants of the 19th century. Has Ed Miliband eschewed his parents’ attitudes towards Jews and Israel? Dr L.B. Sokolic, London SW11. By all means criticise Ed Miliband’s policies — that is what a free press is all about — but to start using his father, who is no longer with us, as a means of character assassination is not only distasteful, but a personal attack. The Mail may put forward all the arguments it has at its disposal against Miliband, the Labour Party and Left-wing beliefs, but it seems to be sinking to the level of the red-top tabloid press it professes to despise when it uses a politician’s family background — and his dead father to boot — to make its point. Jonquil Tracy, Pevensey, Sussex. What a hypocrite Ed Miliband is in protesting against alleging Ralph Miliband hated Britain. When Margaret Thatcher died, there was nothing more disgraceful than the attacks by much of the Labour Party and Trade Unions on her political career. Savage burnings of effigies and parties celebrating her death were organised. Was any attempt made by the Labour Party leadership to call for restraint? No. Not a peep. So pardon me if I have little sympathy for him. His father has got off lightly with regard to criticism of his political life when compared with others. James Wignall, Accrington. I passionately support a free press but deplore your dirty tricks treatment of Ed Miliband’s father. Have we got to endure this for the next 18 months? Don’t appreciate it, don’t like it, don’t approve. Shame. Mrs Louise Bellanti, Bromyard, Herefordshire. In his reply to the Daily Mail ‘Why my father loved Britain’, Ed Miliband appears to give the excuse that his father was only 17 when he made his negative comments of hating Britain. If being 17 years is his excuse — the presumption being one of immaturity — then why is he advocating lowering the voting age to 16? Job Simpson, address supplied. Authoritarian states cannot distinguish between dissent and subversion so it’s a good thing that Geoffrey Levy didn’t make his take on Ed Miliband’s dad under communist rule — otherwise it would have been off to the gulag for him. John Collins, Chelmsford, Essex. I knew Ralph Miliband well in the Eighties. I corroborate everything that his son has said. Ralph did indeed have great affection for Britain, his home for all his adult life. He supported strongly many of the beliefs central to ‘the British way of life’. Contrary to the implications of your editorial, Ralph was a persistent and vociferous critic of Stalinist communism. It was a privilege to have known him. Richard Taylor, Penrith, Cumbria. Ed Miliband is lucky to have had the Mail publish a sizeable rebuff concerning his late Marxist father, Ralph Miliband. If the tables were turned and he had been a fascist, the biased BBC and The Guardian would have, at best, simply ignored son Ed. Maurice Bligh, Sittingbourne, Kent. It’s fine for Labour to vilify Margaret Thatcher once she’s safely dead (as they still vilify Churchill). But Red Ed’s double standards mean that the Daily Mail and others must not tell the truth about his socialist parent, who enjoyed freedom of speech — yet who, like Red Ed, wanted to destroy the freedom of speech enjoyed by those who disagree with him. Chris Hey, Walsall, West Mids. Ed Miliband never stops smearing David Cameron over his background and schooling — but now Ed feels badly served when his own background is mentioned. Martin Burgess, Beckenham, Kent. Double standards? Martin Burgess says that Ed Miliband never stops smearing David Cameron over his background and schooling . Your newspaper has for many years has been serving up a diet of negative portrayal of everything which is going on in Britain, irrespective of whether the government is Labour or Conservative/Liberal. Anybody would think that it is the worst place to live in the world. The latest attack on Ed Miliband’s father is totally unacceptable. I am not a strong supporter of the Labour Party, but it seems you are using this opportunity to paint Ed Miliband and the Labour Party in some kind of Marxist or socialist rhetoric which is completely out of tune with modern Britain. Chris Scott-Barrett, address supplied. Your leading article is in error in claiming that Ed Miliband has a ‘determination to place the British press under statutory control’. Labour, like the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, backs implementation of the Leveson recommendations by Royal Charter. Far from delivering statutory control, this protects freedom of expression and actually reduces the danger of political meddling in the Press. It also offers better protection to ordinary people from the kinds of press abuses that made the Leveson Inquiry necessary. Prof Brian Cathcart, executive director, Hacked Off, London SW1. Naturally, Ed Miliband is going to defend his father, wouldn’t we all do likewise? However, there are many immigrants who enjoy the freedom and generosity of this country but constantly want to change it. That anyone really would want a political system like the impoverished, drab and miserable communist world beggars belief.

A mother-of-two has been told she is facing jail after she stole more than 900 handbags in a crime spree that lasted three years. Jayne Rand, 48, took up to £500,000 of bags and purses from shops where she would walk in without a handbag then brazenly walk out after removing their security tags. Newport Crown Court heard that she took 905 bags and four purses from top designers such as Prada, Gucci and Louis Vuitton. She then sold them on, frequently getting more than £1,000 for each one. All the while her husband, planning consultant Phillip Rand, and grown-up daughters Gemma and Amber had no idea of her one-woman crime wave. Police branded Rand Britain's biggest bag thief after she was caught red-handed by security guards at a shopping centre in Cwmbran, South Wales last December. They said she would routinely target House of Fraser stores. Officers were later able to trace Rand's criminal ventures around the country by analysing CCTV from other stores she'd visited. Police found two other handbags in her car that she is believed to have stolen that day and discovered 'overwhelming evidence' of the other thefts. The jury heard that the stock taken in the nationwide campaign of thefts would have cost stores more than £130,000. But because the mark-up on designer bags is so large the shops themselves would have taken closer to £500,000 had they sold them all. Prosecutor David Wooler said: 'A financial investigation had been looking into the case for some time. 'It is estimated that the value of all the theft would be in excess of £130,000 but that does not take into account the shop’s mark-up.' By . selling the bags on at a drastically reduced price, Rang was able to . make more than £80,000 between 2009 and 2012, and admitted converting . criminal assets from 838 of the handbags. 'Nationwide campaign': The 905 handbags Rand stole included those by Prada (right), Gucci (centre) and Louis Vuitton (left) Neighbours in her home village of Purton, near Swindon, reacted with shock at the secret life of an otherwise 'quiet and respectable' housewife. One said: 'To say everyone is surprised is an understatement - we had no idea. 'They are a lovely family, she is a good wife and mother. There's never been any suggestion of anything like this going on. 'Mrs Rand is quiet and respectable - she is not the sort of person you see with a new handbag every week. There's nothing flashy about her but she likes her holidays.' Judge Rhys Rowlands told the court: 'The defendant was only caught because people in Cwmbran happen to be quite diligent. 'She was caught red-handed with a handbag and in her car were two handbags stolen earlier that day. The evidence is overwhelming. 'This lady has pleaded guilty to a campaign of shoplifting. For all intents and purposes she has carried out a business, and we are talking about tens of thousands of pounds. 'It will be a custodial sentence of some length.' Andrew Taylor, defending, said Rand was a woman of previous good character. Rand was released on conditional bail and is expected to be sentenced in October.","Jayne Rand was convicted of hundreds of thefts at Newport Crown Court .

But, believe it or not, this topsy-turvy piece of work is actually a hotel in Vietnam, known locally as The Crazy House. Designed by eccentric architect Dang Viet Nga, and described by some as 'expressionist', the bizarre building in Da Lat City is covered in bizarre wooden sculpture, features a life-size model tiger to leer at guests, and contains no square windows. Crazy: The bizarre structure rises several stories above the buildings around it, and from this angle looks like a kind of convoluted tree stump . Wild: This inner area of the house features railings painted to look like giraffe skin and trees growing out of the house's roof . Uneven: The rooms inside feature mismatched furniture made from tree stumps, and have undulating ceilings. This room also has a tiger with glowing, red eyes . All natural: The house is decorated with bizarre wooden features, such as this textured wall (left) and a wooden staircase (right), which appears to have been cut straight from a tree trunk . Officially known as Hang Nga Villa, the house, still a work in progress, has been expanding steadily since it was begun in 1990 by Ms Dang. It was converted into a hotel, where rooms are available for around £40 a night, as a way of dealing with the huge losses it incurred. It now attracts 90,000 visitors a year. It contains ten rooms, each of which are themed after a different animal, including the ant, tiger, kangaroo and bear. At first it caused quite a stir with the locals, but they have since grown to appreciate the odd construction. Attraction: The Crazy House, which welcomed 90,000 people last year, can command a sizable audience . Eccentric: The steeply-slanted roof of this portion of the house is just one of its out-of-the-ordinary features . What lies within: All the doorways in the house are an unusual shape, and wood and sculpted concrete interweave in the walls . Business manager Thang Viet Nguyen, 38, said: 'At the beginning most of people . did not accept Crazy House because it was too abnormal, odd, and . strange. 'Gradually people understand it more, little by little. 'Now Crazy House has become acceptable, and is a place that attracts tourists from many other countries.' Ms Dang, who is said to draw paintings of her ideas then give them to local craftsmen to make a reality, said the design of the house is aobut bringing people back in touch with nature. Leafy: Ms Dang, the architect, says she wants the house to bring people and nature closer together . United: Wood used as part of the structure and trees which grow free around the house are almost indistinguishable . Ornate: The house, which seems to look different from every angle, has a rich mixture of features and styles . She said: 'Although I was trained in the mainstream of architecture, I wanted to step out of it, and feel I did so when I created Hang Nga Villa. 'Since the end of the last century till now, nature and the environment have been destroyed. 'I would like to bring people back to nature to be more friendly with it and to love it. 'I do not just want them to make full use of it then destroy it, as people in many places of the world including Vietnam have been doing. 'Everyone aspires for independence and freedom and through the Crazy House I want to realise my dreams of independence and freedom in the art of architecture.'","The Hang Nga Villa in Da Lat City was built in 1990 in a bizarre style .

A Massachusetts woman has opened up about how she fell in love with the former 'Fattest Man in the World' after watching a documentary about the heavyweight Brit. Despite a 3,400mile distance, Rebecca Mountain, 40, from Orange, MA, 'felt compelled' to contact Paul Mason, 52, who weighted more than 70stone at his heaviest, to help him with his plight. Mr Mason, from Ipswich in Suffolk, England, lost 48stone following a gastric bypass, and appeared in a documentary about his life of obesity. Scroll down for video . Romance: Rebecca Mountain, 40, wrote to British Paul Mason, once the world's fattest man, on Facebook after seeing him in a TV documentary about his life . Miss Mountain, got in touch with Mr . Mason on Facebook to offer her help in raising funds for him to have an . operation to remove excess skin following his extraordinary weight loss. 'People . look at a person and make a judgement but anyone who talks to Paul sees . there is more to him,' Miss Mountain told The Daily Mirror. 'His obesity made him the man he is and that turned him into the person I love.' An equally smitten Mr Mason, a former . postman, says he cannot wait to spend the rest of his life with Miss . Mountain, despite the pair never having met in real life . 'I can't think about anyone else and nor can she,' he said. Smitten: As Rebecca, from Orange, near Boston and Paul, from Ipswich, Suffolk, live 3,400 miles apart, the couple have to talk on Skype until Miss Mountain can come to the UK . New love: Paul Mason, pictured at his heaviest, shed 48 stone after a gastric bypass surgery in 2010 . The pair met online last month when Miss Mountain, of Orange, near Boston, Massachusetts, saw a television documentary about Mr Mason's extreme obesity - the result, he says, of overeating when a previous relationship ended. Miss Mountain was so touched by Paul's story that she got in touch via Facebook to offer her help in Mr Mason's bid to get the British National Health Service to pay for a second operation to rid him of layers of excess skin. According to Mr Mason, Miss Mountain did not contact him with the intention of starting a relationship but after their initial online conversation the pair became an item. Mr Mason said: 'I was a bit cautious to start with but as soon as I met her on Skype I felt at ease. We talked for four-and-a-half hours. 'I didn't know anything about her but we talked all about her life and how she wants to help me.' 'It wasn't until the second conversation that I realised there was more there than just friends. She felt the same and brought up the idea of us being boyfriend and girlfriend.' Mr Mason says that he doesn't go for looks and finds Miss Mountain's determined attitude particularly attractive. He said: 'I am more interested in the person rather than the physical side of things. She really wants to come over and see me and I am just desperate to meet her face-to-face, I am so excited. 'It . is her personality, her drive and passion and she has a lovely smile . that made me fall for her. Like me she is a very determined person, I . really adore that quality in her. 'I'm more determined than ever to get this operation and enjoy my life with her' New life: Mr Mason first met Miss Mountain when she got in touch to help him in his quest to have a second operation to remove layers of excess skin . Love letters: A hand crafted that Paul has made to send to Rebecca . Mr Mason ballooned to 70 stone after losing his father in his 20s triggered a compulsive eating disorder. At the height of his food addiction, his daily breakfast would consist of an entire packet of bacon, four sausages and four eggs . complete with bread and hash browns. He would then eat quadruple portions of . fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast . dinner, curries or pizza and more chips in the evening. Mr Mason was forced to quit his job as a postman when his weight prevented him from completing his deliveries. As his weight soared he was left unable . to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked . after full time by council carers. Firefighters had to demolish the front . wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to . lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia . operation in 2002. Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around. He lost more than half of his body weight after a gastric bypass operation, paid for by the British taxpayer, in 2010. He is now fighting to raise funds to get his excess skin removed, something which Rebecca plans to help him with once in the UK.","Rebecca Mountain contacted Brit Paul Mason after seeing him on TV .

Retired headmaster: Andrew Allen, 60, siphoned off the money from the bank accounts of his victim . A retired headmaster has been jailed for three and a half years after stealing £215,000 from an elderly woman who trusted him with her money. Andrew Allen, of Birstall, West Yorkshire, siphoned off the money from the bank accounts of victim Kathleen Steele, who was a life-long friend he knew through his local church. The 60-year-old Christian was granted power of attorney over her financial affairs in 2007 and began to abuse the trust placed in him, Leeds Crown Court was told yesterday. Over three years, Allen - who was headmaster of a primary school - made around 250 illegal transactions which included cash withdrawals, transferring money into his own account and making payments to loan companies. During the period of offending, married father-of-two Allen - who lived in a £240,000 house and was a senior steward and property secretary at Birstall Methodist Church - had also retired from teaching, receiving a lump sum pension payment of £60,000. His crimes came to light a month after Mrs Steele died in a nursing home in August 2010, aged 83. The solicitor responsible for her will's . execution went to police after he had a meeting with Allen and was . ‘astonished’ at how he had behaved. Allen pleaded guilty to three counts . of fraud. Christian: Andrew Allen was a senior steward and property secretary at Birstall Methodist Church (pictured) Prosecutor Sam Andrews told the court that investigators were unable to trace where the money went. The court heard a £400,000 High Court civil judgement had already been made against him. James Keeley, defending, said Allen’s offending was a result of ‘financial mismanagement’, adding: ‘There is no evidence of him having a champagne lifestyle. He is deeply ashamed of himself.’ Judge Christopher Batty said: ‘What I can’t understand is where it has all gone. Mismanagement doesn’t deal with it. It was spent. But spent on what? Certainly the public will never know.’ Home: During the period of offending, Andrew Allen, who lived on this road in Birstall, West Yorkshire in a £240,000 house, had also retired from teaching, receiving a lump sum pension payment of £60,000 .

Anthony Gill has escaped jail despite being caught driving while four times over the legal limit . A repeat drink-driver who got behind the wheel of a car after drinking 12 pints has walked free from court. Anthony GIll, 38, was handed a 24 week suspended jail term after he was caught four times over the limit when he was stopped by police in Felixstowe, Suffolk. Tim Passmore, Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner, has branded the decision 'extraordinary'. The police chief said JPs had sent out a 'very poor signal' as it emerged that Gill also received a suspended sentence for drink-driving in 2007. Mr Passmore has said: 'I find this decision extraordinary. 'Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is totally unacceptable and the constabulary is very clear in that message. 'While I respect it is the magistrate's decision, as a general principle I feel this sends out a very poor signal.' Gill, from Felixstowe, was sentenced to 24 weeks in jail, suspended for two years, and banned from driving for five years at South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court, in Ipswich. He had been drinking for 10 hours on September 7 with a wedding party at the Kesgrave Bell and Kesgrave Community Centre, near Ipswich, before he got in his car to drive home. The court heard he had drunk 12 pints of lager. When police stopped him he had 153 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 . millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35mcg. Magistrate David Broughton told him: 'This offence is so serious that custody is warranted. 'Your alcohol rate was extremely high and showed a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users. Gill was sentenced to 24 weeks in jail, suspended for two years, and banned from driving for five years at South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court, in Ipswich (pictured) 'This was a close-run thing Mr Gill. You came extremely close to going through the door into custody today.' Police stopped Gill at traffic lights in Felixstowe after he accidentally turned his rear windscreen wipers on and clipped the kerb after a turn. Hugh Rowlands, defending, said he had planned to go back to his girlfriend's rather than drive home but she had not been able to go to the event following a death in her family. 'While I respect it is the magistrate's decision, as a general principle I feel this sends out a very poor signal' - Suffolk PCC Tim Passmore . Mr Rowlands said Gill, a software company manager who earns more than £50,000-a-year, had 'never really recovered' from losing his father in 2011 and would lose his job if jailed. Road safety campaigner Michelle Luetchford, whose sister Emma was killed by a drink driver in 2009, said outside court: 'If he didn't learn the first time, it's not going to do anything a second time. 'He could have killed somebody and that would have been a whole different story.' Mrs Luetchford, of Ipswich, added: 'The sentences should be tougher all round. He should be severely punished.' A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Drink driving can have devastating consequences which is why the maximum sentence for causing death by drink driving is rightly 14 years in prison. 'There is also no limit to the length of driving bans that a court can impose. 'However, sentences in individual cases are for the courts to decide, taking into account all the circumstances of each case.'

Scroll down to hear excerpts from the tapes . President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy, and Texas Governor John Connally ride through Dallas moments before Kennedy was assassinated, November 22, 1963. Icon: JFK (centre) with wife Jacqueline descend the Grand Staircase a reception at the White House on November 20, 1963. Two days later he was shot dead . The John F. Kennedy Presidential . Library and Museum is releasing the last 45 hours of more than 260 hours . of privately recorded meetings, conversations and phone calls. They include discussions about the . conflict in Vietnam, Soviet relations and the race to space, plans for . the 1964 Democratic Convention and re-election strategy. There are also . tender moments with his children. But some of the material captured on . the cassettes is still deemed so sensitive to national security they . have to remain classified. Kennedy kept the recordings a secret from his top aides. He made the last one two days before his death. Much of the material concerns the day-to-day schedules which make up White House life. The exchange about JFK's fateful trip to Texas comes as senior staffers try to organise his diary for the week. Play time: Kennedy's children, John Jr and Caroline can be heard in the Oval Office during a conversation with the Soviet Foreign Minister .

He’ll be coming back here though, I . understand on Friday because I offered to entertain at dinner.’ JFK: ‘I’m going to be up at the Cape on Friday – so I’ll see him Tuesday (November 26).' There is also a session with advisers on young voters, which could easily take place in a modern-day administration. ‘What is it we have to sell them?,’ the President asks before saying:  ‘We hope we have to sell them . prosperity, but for the average guy the prosperity is nil.' ‘He's not unprosperous, but he's not very prosperous. ... And the people who really are well off hate our guts.’ JFK also comments on the distance between the political machine and voters. ‘We've got so mechanical an operation . here in Washington that it doesn't have much identity where these . people are concerned,’ he says. ’ Kennedy library archivist Maura Porter said that JFK may have been saving them for a memoir. It is also possible he wanted to keep . an indisputable record of his meetings, prompted by the military . producing a different interpretation of a discussion about the Bay of . Pigs fiasco. Porter said the public first heard about the existence of the Kennedy recordings during the Watergate hearings. In 1983, JFK Library and Museum . officials started reviewing tapes without classified materials and . releasing recordings to the public. Porter said officials were able to go . through all the recordings by 1993, working with government agencies . when it came to national security issues and what they could make . public. In all, the JFK Library and Museum . has put out about 40 recordings. She said officials excised about five . to ten minutes of this last group of recordings due to family . discussions and about 30 minutes because of national security concerns. Porter has supervised the . declassification of these White House tapes since 2001, and she said . people will have a much better sense of the kind of leader JFK was after . hearing them. President Kennedy is given the battle flag of the 2506 brigade which invaded Cuba at the Bay of Pigs in April 1960 - an event which would haunt his term in office .

While some go along with meeting . minutes that also are public, she said, listening to JFK's voice makes . his personality come alive. She said he comes across as an . intelligent man who had a knack for public relations and was very . interested in his public image. But she said the tapes also reveal times when the president became bored or annoyed and moments when he used swear words. The sound of the president's . children, Caroline and John Jr., playing outside the Oval Office is part . of a recording on which he introduces them to Soviet Foreign Minister . Andrei Gromyko. ‘Hello, hello,’ Gromyko says as the children come in, telling their father, ‘They are very popular in our country.’ JFK tells the children, mentioning a . dog Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gifted the family: ‘His chief is . the one who sent you Pushinka. You know that? You have the puppies.’ JFK Library spokeswoman Rachel Flor . said the daughter of the late president has heard many of the . recordings, but she wasn't sure if she had heard this batch. ‘He'd go from being a president to being a father,’ Porter said of the recordings. ‘... And that was really cute.’ On another recording, Kennedy . questions conflicting reports military and diplomatic advisers bring . back from Vietnam, asking the two men: ‘You both went to the same . country?’ He also talks about trying to create films for the 1964 Democratic Convention in colour instead of black and white. ‘The colour is so damn good,’ he says. ‘If you do it right.’ More information about the archive can be found on www.jfklibrary.org .

The referendum on whether Scotland should leave the UK is still a year away - but a group of craftsmen have already started the job of dividing England from its northern neighbour. Four dryliners from Cumbria are helping to rebuild parts of Hadrian's Wall, which was erected by the Romans to keep the 'barbarian' inhabitants of Scotland out of 'civilised' England. The project is intended as a way of protecting the ancient stone wall - but one of the workers jokes that they may have to reinforce the barrier with concrete if the referendum is successful in splitting up Britain. Restoration: Craftsman Steven Allen pictured helping to rebuild Hadrian's Wall in northern Britain . Historic: The workers, including George Allonby, are using the original Roman stone to repair weaker sections . Collaboration: The local experts have resorted to old-fashioned techniques to reinforce the monument . Hadrian's Wall was built in the 2nd century AD and manned by Roman soldiers, who wanted to protect their British territory from the Picts who lived in what is now Scotland. Ever since the Act of Union in 1707, the wall has run across the middle of the United Kingdom - but after next year's referendum, it could become an international border once again. Every inhabitant of Scotland will be asked to vote on the question, 'Should Scotland be an independent country?' on September 18 next year. Most polls suggest that the referendum question is likely to be rejected, but if it succeeds it will fundamentally change the landscape of Britain. Friendly: George Allonby and Mark Jennings set to work replacing sections of the wall which have weakened . History: But some have joked that the wall could divide England and Scotland if the UK breaks up next year . Atmospheric: The wall runs for more than 80 miles across the hills of northern Britain . The four dryliners who are rebuilding Hadrian's Wall are more interested in contributing to history than arguing about politics, however. George Allonby, Mark Jennings, Steven Allen and Geoff Capstick are taking original Roman stone from stronger sections of the wall in order to reinforce the weaker sections. They are shifting 10 tonnes of stone every day as part of the £500,000 project, which was commissioned by the Hadrian's Wall Trust and will continue until the end of next month. Heavy duty: The workers are moving 10 tonnes of ancient stone every ay as part of the project . Hard at work: The £500,000 project is due to continue until the end of next month . Hadrian's Wall takes its name from the Emperor Hadrian, who ruled over the Romans at the time the fortification was first constructed in 122 AD. The wall stretches across northern Britain from the River Tyne in the east to the Solway Firth in the west, roughly dividing the territory of the Romans from that of the Picts. The vast majority of the wall is now in England, suggesting that the border between the two countries has shifted north since ancient times. It was dotted with fortified towers which would have provided the bases for Roman soldiers defending the territory and inhabitants of their empire. Although much of Hadrian's Wall is now in a state of relative disrepair, it is still a notable landmark in the region and is popular among hikers walking its 84-mile length. 'This is a really enjoyable job,' Mr . Allen said. 'To think you're working with stone somebody put in 2,000 . years ago. And leaving something at the end of the day that'll be there . in 200 to 300 years - there's not many jobs that are like that. 'It's . about picking the right stone to go in the right place. You've got to . look for the one that's going to fit. That comes with experience. It's a . big jigsaw.' Bryan Scott, from the Hadrian's Wall Trust, said: 'By repairing the dry stone wall we're protecting the Roman wall underneath. 'The wall was built to separate Romans and barbarians. The wall is still used as a boundary - but now it's between fields rather than Romans and barbarians.' Mr Scott also joked that it might be time to rebuild the wall entirely if the independence referendum drives England and Scotland apart. 'A local civil engineering firm was asked to calculate the cost of a wall made of concrete,' he said. 'It was £80million at 1974 prices - maybe we should think about it if there is a ""yes"" vote for Scottish independence next year?'","Four dryliners from Cumbria shore up weak sections of Roman frontier .

British pilots celebrated after a key EU transport committee of MEPs rejected plans to impose controversial new flight time rules which they believe were unsafe. Pilots claim the proposed changes to flying hours and rostered rest periods will put lives at risk by increasing the chances of fatigued fliers falling asleep in the cockpits of packed passenger planes. The proposals still face further votes in coming weeks by the full European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, in which British ministers have a voice. Puts lives at risk: British pilots are celebrating after a EU transport committee rejected plans to impose controversial new flight time rules which they say are unsafe . The rules must be backed by both votes to go ahead but air transport experts believe the rejection by the EU’s Transport and Tourism Select Committee – by 20 votes to 13 – increases the chances of the new rules being kicked out. The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) hailed the committee’s rejection as a ‘vote for common sense’ and called on the British Government and MEPs ‘to act to protect the safety of our skies'. Today, BALPA published polling evidence and personal testimonials from pilots admitting that both captain and co-pilot fell asleep in the cockpit at the same time. It also recorded testimony of a pilot whose over-tired captain nodded-off low over London as his aircraft came in to land at Gatwick Airport. Last week BALPA revealed a poll of 500 pilots showing six out of 10 said they had fallen asleep in the cockpit and of those, almost one in three said they woke to find the other pilot was also asleep. And one in six had been in the cockpit when both flight crew were asleep. A 'vote of common sense': The British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) published testimonials and evidence from pilots and co-pilots who admitted they had fallen asleep in the cockpit at the same time . After the EU vote, BALPA general secretary Jim McAuslan said: ‘British pilots will welcome the EU Transport Committee’s rejection of the proposed EU cuts to UK flight safety. ‘The botched new rules have been rejected by scientists, MPs on the UK Transport Committee, British pilots with 40 million hours of flying experience between them and by the public, 90 per cent of whom are concerned that a pilot could be landing their aircraft having been awake for 22hours.’ ‘The commission must now go back to the drawing board and work with pilots and scientists to develop rules on flying time and tiredness that are based on evidence and expert experience. ‘Pilots will continue to urge UK Ministers, MEPs and the CAA to protect the safety of our skies and help pilots make every flight a safe flight.’ BALPA will press British MEPs to vote against the proposals in a full session of the European Parliament and for the UK Government Ministers to oppose them in the EU Council of Ministers. It will also press transport ministers in the UK to order an audit of the proposals by an independent group of scientists and medical experts. Over-tired pilots: BALPA general secretary Jim McAuslan (right) said rejecting to vote was an 'act to protect the safety of our skies' and Labour MP Louise Ellman (left), who chairs the House of Commons Transport Committee, agrees that the proposed EU changes could endanger air passenger safety . Today pilots’ leaders released a damning new dossier of first-hand testimony from jetlagged flight crew admitting to falling asleep in the cockpit – sometimes simultaneously. One transatlantic long-haul pilot reported how both he and his captain were asleep at the same time at night and woken only by the aircraft’s warning alert system. He said: ‘I was taking my turn of 40 minutes controlled rest, in the cruise, crossing the Atlantic on a night flight. ‘I was woken after about 20 minutes by a warning sound from the aircraft. The captain was awoken at the same time as me. It appears that he had also fallen asleep at the same time, the pilot alert system had been ignored and so the aircraft reacted to wake us up.’ Asleep in the cockpit: In BALPA testimonies, a pilot admitted his captain fell asleep during the landing approach at London's Gatwick Airport . A captain also admitted being asleep while his co-pilot also slept leaving no one in charge. He . said: ‘I have fallen asleep at the controls in command twice. On the . one occasion my colleague was having a “controlled rest”.’ Another pilot told BALPA how his captain nodded off low over London at a ‘critical’ stage of the plane’s landing approach to Gatwick Airport.  As the plane was lined up to head into Gatwick and link with the airport’s instrument landing system, the co-pilot spoke to his captain to prepare the plane for the manoeuvre, but noted: ‘The captain did not respond. I asked him a second time and shook him at which he woke up.’ The pilot said: ‘He had fallen asleep between taking a radio call from ATC [air traffic control] and me requesting flap. He fell asleep over a distance say of three miles while the aircraft was between 2-3,000ft in the London area. After landing the captain signed off fatigued. He was signed off by his doctor for a month.’ The testimony followed publication by the CAA of an incident report from a Virgin Atlantic pilot flying an Airbus saying he and his colleague were suffering extreme fatigue in the cockpit after having only five hours sleep over two days but the pair were not asleep simultaneously. Louise Ellman, who chairs the influential all-party House of Commons Transport Committee and is Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside, said: ‘I agree with BALPA’s concerns that the proposed changes to EU rules could endanger air passenger safety. ‘Our committee has already warned that the changes could mean pilots landing planes after being awake for 22 hours.’ ‘There is still time for the UK Government and Europe to think again.’","The EU transport committee rejected plans to impose new flight time rules .

The tragedy began at 7pm on May 30 when the labourer - described by friends as a 'star who lived life to the full' - was being driven through Levenshulme, Manchester, following a training session at a local boxing gym. Michael Dolan told an inquest how he called an ambulance as Mr Lyons tried to revive the victim . He saw 40-year-old Glen Delaney being beaten up in the street and told his friend Michael Dolan to stop the car and call an ambulance, before he tried to revive the victim as the killers fled. Despite the efforts of the two men Mr Delaney died that night in hospital from severe facial injuries. Mr Dolan, 24, told the hearing in Sale: 'We saw a man in the street and he was being badly beaten. 'His face was a mess and we rang an ambulance. It came and we were told later the man had died. 'At the scene Sean had been sick at the side of the van. But it was more him looking after me that night. 'We went back to my girlfriend’s and he seemed OK at this point. 'We stayed up late but I had work in the morning. He seemed fine when I'd left him and we had made plans for the next day. 'Sean had seen a group of men across the road so was going to speak to the police. 'Next thing we were aware of is when we got a phone call from Sean's mum saying he hadn't come home. 'There was no indication he had something on his mind.' Sean’s mother, Bridget Lyons, from . Reddish, near Stockport, said: 'At about 7pm on Thursday, May 30 he rang . his dad on his mobile. 'On his way back from boxing with Michael he said he had seen someone collapsed in the street and people were running away. 'He was very subdued on the phone. He wasn’t talking much only about the guy who died after being beaten up. 'He put Michael on the phone and he was very talkative. Bridget Marie Lyons (left) mother of Sean, stands outside Trafford Coroners court following the inquest into his death . 'They were telling us what they saw. They tried to resuscitate him. 'We could tell he was affected by what he had seen, he was very sensitive. He had never seen anything like what he described that night. 'They had gone out after coming across that incident. Sean had gone back to Michael’s girlfriend’s and I told him to come home. 'He seemed fine. He was concerned for Michael after what they had seen and in my opinion Sean felt he was needed. 'I would have expected him to be home by 1.20am. I said he needed to come home and he said he would be home soon. 'He said ""I can't get that man’s face out of my head"". 'He had texted his dad next day about . going into police station. We then fell asleep and realised he hadn’t . came home when we woke up.' A forensic examiner studies the scene in Manchester where Glen Delaney was found with fatal injuries . The hearing was told how after leaving the home of Michael’s girlfriend, Sean came across a group of four young women camping in a field in Stockport. Ailish Hession told the inquest: 'He told us about the man earlier and he didn’t want to go home to sleep because he couldn’t get his face out of his head. 'He went to speak to someone on the phone at about 5.20. 'You wouldn’t know anything was wrong with him. He seemed happy. He said he wasn’t tired and he was going to go. 'He said he was going to go to a friend’s house and was going to come back if we were still awake.' In the minutes before his death Sean took some pictures of himself smiling at 6.15am on his mobile whilst stood on the footbridge. He also had sent his father, Andy, a text saying: 'Sorry I haven’t come home. Was with Michael and didn’t want to wake you up.' Despite the efforts of the two men Mr Delaney died that night in hospital from severe facial injuries . Police said Sean also made a six minute 999 call at 5.40am to an operator to report he had witnessed the murder . Inspector Laura Escott said: 'I listened to his call and had a transcript prepared. 'There was nothing in the call that would give cause for concern. His first words to the call taker were ""Hiya love"". 'He said he was prepared to be a witness and would come into the police station later that day. He gave his name, date of birth and address. 'I made a conscious decision not to speak to the call handler who took the call. 'I didn't believe she was at fault. I listened to the call myself. 'I thought I might distress her by telling her a person who spoke to her had taken their own life a short time later.' Recording a suicide verdict Coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'It’s difficult to know what to say where there is clearly so little indication that something so tragic was going to occur. 'He told police about what was such a distressing incident. He had met a group of people and there’s nothing unusual about that. 'But he leaves there at 5.30am and texts a number of family and friends and there’s nothing to give any indication. 'To all Sean’s family can I just offer my condolences. He was a young man with so much to live for.' A man is awaiting trial over Delaney's murder.

With their metal roofs, six-foot high numbers and uncompromising industrial design, they look like shipping containers full of goods ready to be exported to China. In fact, these awkward-looking boxes are new beach huts for the coastal town of Shoebury in Essex, where councillors hope to sell leases on them at £20,000 apiece. Residents have branded the new huts 'monstrosities' and say they look nothing like the pretty, traditional huts just a few yards down the town's East Beach. Waiting to be loaded onto a boat? In fact, these are beach huts for the 21st century in Shoebury, Essex . 'Like shipping containers': Residents in the Essex coastal town signed a petition against the new huts . They also say the 'flimsy' design of the eight new huts will not withstand the brutal east coast winter. Southend Council funded the £120,000 cost of building the huts - there are eight more in the pipeline - and now plans to sell seven-year leases on each one for £20,000. The roofs are covered with small sedum plants, the walls are made of clear plastic filled with hardcore, and the fronts painted in bright colours. But locals in the town are not impressed by the design of the huts, which are said to be made of vandal-proof materials that will not catch fire. Anne Chalk, a councillor in Shoebury, said: 'They really do look terrible - they are monstrosities. 'I would pay £20,000 to have them pulled down - they are more like shipping containers than beach huts.' Modern design: The walls of the new huts are made of clear plastic filled with hardcore to deter vandals . Holiday spot: Southend Council, which approved the huts and spent £120,000 on them, hopes to let them . Dream destination: The new East Beach huts have roofs covered with small sedum plants . She added: 'They are very dark inside and I think they will be vandalised too. I don’t think they are strong enough structures to last.' Trevor Gehlcken, who lives nearby . said: 'What is there to stop the sea winds blowing these flimsy articles . into kingdom come? Absolutely nothing. 'They sit there with no foundations like garden sheds, just waiting to be destroyed in the first gale of the winter. 'Has anyone actually been to East . Beach in the winter to see how rough things can get? If any of these huts are still in place this time next . year, I will donate £50 to charity.' Traditional Shoebury beach huts: These old-fashioned wooden huts further down the beach are much loved . And the not so traditional: The new beach huts have been criticised by locals for their design and appearance . Another eight of the huts, which were designed by a London architecture practice, are set to be built further along East Beach, despite more than 200 local residents signing a petition against them. Andrew Moring of Southend Council defended the new addition to the Shoebury shoreline, saying they would 'blend in with our existing range'. And the council's Alan Richards said: 'The unique and generous size of the huts has received a great deal of praise and overwhelmingly positive feedback.'","Huts in Shoebury have metal roofs and plastic walls filled with hardcore .

But one force are refusing to let the harsh measures stop them fighting crime - and have called on rural horse owners to saddle up and patrol the countryside for them. A bunch of public-minded volunteers have answered the call, and been given high-visibility jackets with police markings and matching leg straps and coats for their steeds.' The new 12-strong Rural Mounted Patrol will police the lanes, bridleways and country roads of Hampshire . The new 12-strong Rural Mounted Patrol will police the lanes, bridleways and country roads of Hampshire on the hunt for suspicious activity. Rural crime ranges from property theft to fly-tipping, metal thefts, deer poaching and sheep rustling. Volunteer Wendy Thairs is looking forward to taking her two horses on patrol in New Forest, Hants. She said: 'The thin blue line has been stretched as far as it can go, so the rural community has to stand up and be counted. 'Having suffered from rural crime - but luckily our equipment was found and returned undamaged - it’s now ‘pay back time’. 'Both my horses, Groombridge and Kentucky, are recently retired from the Metropolitan Police Mounted Branch and are still eager to go out on patrol. The riders, who are subject to security checks, have no more power of arrest than any other citizen . 'Groombridge is so big I can see over most people’s hedges and obviously we don’t need four wheel drive to go off road.' The volunteers will report back to the police control room. Vanessa Dowling, from Emsworth, Hants, said she’s happy to help keep lookout in areas that are difficult for officers to reach. She said: 'When our horses are out patrolling the lanes, bridleways and forests, we are able to get to areas that cannot be easily reached by car. 'We are a highly visual presence in the rural landscape and are trained to see and recognise things that might be unusual and out of the ordinary. 'It’s all about helping the rural police on difficult terrains and putting something back into the community where we live and the countryside that we love.' Rural crime ranges from property theft to fly-tipping, metal thefts, deer poaching and sheep rustling . Hampshire Constabulary have joined forces with Hampshire Horsewatch scheme members in the drive to tackle rural crime across six areas. Hampshire Horsewatch is a community-led project aimed at preventing thieves who target equine equipment. David Collings, Hampshire Horsewatch co-ordinator and the force’s equine liaison officer, has high hopes for the patrols, who will put in around eight hours a month. Mr Collings said: 'With the reduction of funding being experienced within the police service there is a need to be as dynamic and imaginative as we can to cover rural policing in Hampshire.' The riders, who are subject to security checks, have no more power of arrest than any other citizen. They and their horses must prove their on and off road work before being given an area to patrol. They are also expected to keep their tack in good order and make sure their horse is ‘clean and tidy'. Chief Inspector Simon Dodds, the force’s lead on rural policing, said the mounted patrols were an ‘exciting development’. Chief Insp Dodds said: 'Having police volunteers on horseback is an exciting development in how rural areas of the force are patrolled. 'Working in partnership with rural neighbourhood teams, the riders will help combat crime in some of our more isolated communities.'","Volunteers have been given high-visibility jackets with police markings and matching leg straps and coats for their steeds .

He began sending her nude pictures of himself and telling her to respond with naked images of herself. The youngster, frightened of being rejected, did as she was asked, before meeting up with her father.

On Friday the man was sentenced to 30 months after last month admitting to four counts of sexual activity with a child family member. The NHS identifies Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as 'an anxiety disorder caused by very stressful, frightening or distressing events'. It can develop immediately after someone experiences a disturbing event or it can occur belatedly, sometimes taking years to manifest itself. PTSD affects up to 30 per cent of people who experience a traumatic event. It affects around 5 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women at some point during their life.","Serviceman renewed contact with daughter after they lost touch .

A mother who went from a vivacious young woman to a drunken wreck has been handed an Asbo after terrorising neighbours with a series of raucous parties at her home. Photographs reveal that in just five months of binging, Rebecca Proctor was transformed from looking healthy and fresh-faced to being haggard and sullen, with local children dubbing her 'The Attic Monster'. The 28-year-old constantly drank Lambrini and had a stream of friends to her house in Burnley, Lancashire for all-night parties accompanied by drugs and loud music. Contrast: Rebecca Proctor has gone from a fresh-faced young mother, left, to a haggard drunk, right, in just five months after embarking on a non-stop binge . Rowdy: The 28-year-old held raucous parties at her home which lasted up to five days, according to neighbours . The stark deterioration in Proctor's appearance was revealed by comparing photos taken by friends and uploaded to Facebook in April with her police mugshot, taken when her Asbo was imposed last week. She has now been forced to leave her home, and banned from her regular haunts such as local shopping centres. If Proctor, a mother of one, returns to the house and causes further distress to neighbours she could be jailed for up to five years. Reedley Magistrates' Court imposed the order after hearing that she was 'repeatedly responsible for causing noise nuisance and displaying drunk and disorderly behaviour'. Before: Proctor, a mother of one, looks happy in pictures taken by friends earlier this year . After: She became addicted to drinking Lambrini and other types of alcohol during her binge sessions . Proctor's former neighbours welcomed the decision to evict her from the area, describing how she would keep them awake with parties which went on for up to five days at a time. One said: 'It's an absolute total relief to the neighbourhood that she's gone, and it's fair to say we've had our first peaceful night's sleep in ages. 'Rebecca was nothing but a drunk and a terrible drunk at that. She may look as though butter would not melt in some of her pictures but the reality was she was nothing but trouble. 'She would have three or four blokes around every weekend and they would be sat there drinking for England and taking drugs. It was disgusting. 'When she first moved in she was alright and I tried to help her. I even mended her child's bike and helped her out with odd jobs. But then she lost it and her true colours shone through ever since. Kicked out: Proctor has been forced to leave her Burnley home after being handed an Asbo . 'Sadly it was the drink which took over her life and she's been a constant source of problems round her. It was parties every weekend and we couldn't sleep. It would just be noise from them shouting more than noise from music. 'Sometimes it was just a couple of them, and sometimes it was four or five people and they would be out here in front of our house and in the street drinking and taking drugs. 'Sometimes she would be downstairs with people having a party when her child was upstairs. It was nightmare living next door to her.' The 52-year-old woman, who gave evidence at Proctor's Asbo hearing, added: 'Sometimes parties would go on from Thursday until Monday. They would sleep in the day when we're at work and in the night be all shouting and drinking. 'I believe she is seeking treatment for her alcohol abuse and she says she has managed to curb her drinking - but only from two bottles of Lambrini a day to one and a half.' Natalie Whittaker from Lancashire Police said: 'This Asbo is an excellent result for local residents who were being kept up until all hours because of noise and excessive drinking by Rebecca Proctor. 'They had really had enough and I hope that this result will enable them to sleep without disruption. 'I hope this sends out a clear message that police and other agencies will not tolerate this type of behaviour and will take firm action against those involved in anti-social behaviour.'","Rebecca Proctor, 28, went on five-month drinking binge earlier this year .

The British tourist who nearly died when a rogue taxi cab drove onto a Manhattan sidewalk and severed her foot appear on the Dr Oz show Tuesday for their first reunion since her horrific ordeal. Sian Green, 24, was walking with a friend near Oz's production offices August 20 when a cab driver lost control and ran her over. Among those who rushed to her aid was television personality Dr Oz, who brought Green in to do a taping of his show just a day after she was discharged from the hospital. Meeting Green for the first time will be David Justino, the heroic plumber who used his belt as a tourniquet to staunch the bleeding, thus saving Green’s life. Scroll down for video... Reunited: Taped just a day after her release from the hospital, British tourist Sian Green appeared on the stage of Dr. Oz, who helped save her life when she was struck by a rogue cab in New York City August 20 . Staying positive: The remarkably upbeat Green is reunited in the episode, which airs Tuesday, with Dr. Oz and meets the plumber David Justino (right) who saved her by using his belt as a tourniquet . Green speaks at length to Dr Oz about how losing her leg, which had to be amputated, has changed her life and about her plans for the future. Remarkably, the beautiful young woman has retained an upbeat attitude despite her loss and has even used the accident to help improve her outlook on life. 'You can¿t take anything for granted': Green's foot was severed by the taxi and her leg eventually amputated. But she has managed to keep a positive attitude . ‘I’m so young and I have so much to look forward to,’ she explains to Dr. Oz, whose assistance was vital during Green’s ordeal. Green was seeing the sites of New York City in August with her friend Keshia Warren when cab driver Faysal Kabir Mohammad Himon of Queens, New York, 24 lost control and slammed into Green. The driver, who has received seven traffic violations in the last three years, had reportedly just been in an argument with a cyclist when tragedy struck. Charges have not been brought against Himon. Regardless, Green likely doesn’t hold a grudge. ‘I can’t be down in the dumps because I have so much to look forward to,’ she says. Green, who once hoped to become a model, says she’s not always at 100 percent, but she does what she can. ‘I get them days where I’m just a bit not as happy, not as smiley,’ she tells Dr. Oz. ‘I still do smile, but I’m 24 years old and this happened to me with my bestest friend, walking, enjoying life.’ She’s now just taking life as it comes. ‘You can’t take anything for granted because it can be gone like that,’ she said. Hero: Green said if it wasn't for the actions of strangers who rushed to help she wouldn't have survived the accident. David Justino (right) used a belt to make a tourniquet for her leg, while celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz (left) also raced to the scene . Investigation: No charges have yet been filed against the taxi driver in the incident, who reportedly lost control of car after an argument with a cyclist and ploughed into Miss Green . She told the New York Post it felt 'fantastic' to be discharged and will not let the horrific incident destroy her dreams. The pretty brunette hopes to model again and launch her own clothing line. 'This won’t stop me from doing that,' she said. The crash happened on the second day of her trip to the city and she did not get to do the things she wanted. 'The only thing I really wanted to do was go to the top of the Empire State Building,' she said in a Tuesday appearance on Today. 'I wanted to go shopping, meet up with a few friends, do the typical New York things.' Aspirations: Sian Green hoped to become a model and was training to be a buyer for Hugo Boss . Passersby rushed to help Miss Green immediately after the incident. David Justino used his belt to make a life-saving tourniquet for her leg while a pizza truck owner raced to put her foot on ice. Her appearance on Dr Oz marks her first meeting with Justino, who visited Green once at the hospital but could only meet her family. The two share an embrace and emotions run high through the first meeting. ‘I just, I, I, the appreciation and I just, oh, thank you,’ says Green. ‘You're welcome. You're so welcome,’ replied the humble Justino. ‘You don't have to say thank you. I  happened. I tried, I wasn't even thinking. I didn't even think. I just saw you there and the only thing I had was my belt and that's what I needed.’","Sian Green, 24, lost her left leg when a rogue taxi cab ran onto the sidewalk in front of Dr Oz's production offices in New York City .

But the Vilnius Appeals Court said there was not enough evidence linking him to the terrorist group. Released: Michael Campbell puts his thumb up as he appears at an appeals court in Vilnius, Lithuania . He smiled as police removed his . handcuffs and said: 'I am very happy. I will go to Ireland as soon as possible.' Two years ago, a Lithuanian court found him guilty in a case which drew attention to the splinter group's plans to target London. Video footage and intercepted communications . showed Campbell had allegedly paid about more than £5,000 for high-grade . explosives, grenade launchers, detonators, AK-47s and a special . assassin's rifle to Lithuanian agents posing as arms dealers. In . an audio recording, Campbell was also heard discussing how easy it would be . with the type of equipment on offer to plant a bomb in London and . escape. He was given prison sentences of five years for weapons possession, six years for attempting to smuggle weapons and explosives, and 12 years for supporting a terrorist group. However, . the judge at that trial said the sentences on the weapons charges would . be canceled since no harm was caused and that Campbell did not have . prior convictions for similar offenses. Return: After the ruling, a smiling Campbell told AFP he planned 'to go home' to Ireland . At the appeals hearing, Judge Viktoras Kazys said: 'There . was no direct evidence proving Campbell's ties with Real IRA.

Gamble?: Families are opting for holidays rather than banking their money for retirement . Workers are more likely to save for a holiday than for their retirement, according to a study. Researchers found that 36 per cent of us are putting money aside for a trip away, but only 26 per cent are making provision for old age. And one in five admits to having no savings at all. The survey, conducted by lending service Zopa, discovered that while two thirds of us consider ourselves good with money, most are not making any long-term financial plans. And of those who do have savings, 59 per cent keep them in accounts where the interest rate is below inflation – some as low as 0.66 per cent. With the current rate of inflation at 2.8 per cent, these savings are effectively losing value. Many also end up losing out when banks' introductory bonus rates expire and leave them on worse rates - a practice the Financial Conduct Authority has pledged to investigate. According to the survey, the top ten . savings goals are: holiday; rainy day emergency fund; retirement; . children; buying a property; new car; future repairs; grandchildren; . down payment for a house; and starting a family. The research found eight in ten of us have little or no trust in our savings provider. Yet less than half (43 per cent) actually review their savings once a year, and 51 per cent don't know the current rate of interest on their savings accounts. Independent financial analyst, Louise Cooper CFA said: 'Britons need to bulk up their savings to get them working as hard as they do, even more so when money is tight.

'If you don't like bankers, why give them your savings?' When asked what Brits are saving for, retirement came in third and saving for a house deposit came ninth on the list. While over two thirds (69 per cent) of 18 to 54 year olds believe they are good with money, just 21 per cent of this group are actively saving for retirement. This is despite 81 per cent admitting they need to save in order to have a comfortable retirement and avoid a retirement crisis.","Just 26 per cent of us are putting money away for old age .

The White House never though the government would actually shut down and as a result West Wing officials hardly spent any time over the past week planning for it, an administration aide said. It was only at the weekend after House Republicans decided to prolong their fight on health care and send a budget bill back to the Senate with a one-year delay in Obamacare, that the reality of the situation became apparent. Congress has missed the deadline for averting the first partial government shutdown in 17 years at midnight on Monday. Scroll down for video . The White House never though the government would actually shut down and as a result West Wing officials hardly spent any time over the past week planning for it, an administration aide said on Monday . As the clock struck midnight Monday, House Republicans were demanding that the Senate negotiate their demand for a one-year delay in making millions of people buy health insurance under President Barack Obama's 2010 health care law. Minutes before midnight, the White House ordered a shutdown. The Democratic Senate on Monday twice rejected GOP demands to delay key portions of what has become to known as Obamacare as a condition for keeping the government open. An estimated 800,000 federal workers faced furloughs though many were told work a half day Tuesday. Critical functions like air traffic control and military operations will continue. Social Security benefits will be paid. National parks and most federal offices will close. Now that the shutdown has taken affect, they intend continue to project an image of a White House keeping up with the country’s business and not just the drama on Capitol Hill, reports Politico. Speaker of the House John Boehner parried a Senate-passed temporary budget bill that wouldn't defund the Obamacare law, and is now angling for a one-year pause in the law's implementation instead as a halfway measure . As much of the federal government grinds to a halt, President Barack Obama is telling the U.S. military he'll push Congress to re-open the government as soon as possible. In his sole response early Tuesday to Congress' failure to avert the first shutdown in nearly two decades, Obama addressed his comments in a video to American troops, rather than the lawmakers he's been scolding for weeks. There was no reference in the three-minute video message to Republicans, whose insistence that Obama's health care law be scaled back has been at the center of a grueling back-and-forth between the GOP-controlled House and the Democratic-led Senate. ‘Unfortunately, Congress has not fulfilled its responsibility,’ Obama said. ‘It has failed to pass a budget and, as a result, much of our government must now shut down until Congress funds it again.’ Troops in uniform in Afghanistan and elsewhere will stay on duty, Obama said, noting he'd signed a law Monday to ensure they get their paychecks on time. That GOP bill began in the House and was taken up by the Senate, reflecting a rare measure of agreement among Democrats and Republicans: No one wants to be blamed for the military not getting paid. Addressing the troops: President Obama released a video directed towards the members of the military, explaining that they will still be working and earning their paychecks but their civilian counterparts will be furloughed . But thousands of civilians who work for the Defense Department face furloughs, compounding the damage already inflicted on the military by automatic spending cuts. ‘I know this comes on top of the furloughs that many of you already endured this summer,’ Obama said. ‘You and your families deserve better than the dysfunction we're seeing in Congress.’ Hundreds of thousands of government workers will be off the job Tuesday after a short work period to wind down operations, but some essential services, including border patrols, air traffic controllers and Social Security benefits, will continue. Meanwhile, it was unclear how long the shutdown would last or how Congress would find a way to agree on restoring funding. As the shutdown approached hours earlier with Congress gridlocked, Obama called Republican and Democratic congressional leaders, but there was no breakthrough in the budget impasse. Obama said a ‘shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people, right away,’ with hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed and veterans' centers, national parks, most of the space agency and other government operations shuttered. Putting pen to paper: This is the memo that implemented the shutdown at midnight on Monday . He blamed House Republicans, whom he accused of seeking to tie government funding to ideological demands, ‘all to save face after making some impossible promises to the extreme right wing of their party.’ On Tuesday, Obama planned to meet with Americans who will enroll in new insurance exchanges created by his health care law; ironically, implementation of the law and the opening of the exchanges on Tuesday will proceed despite the shutdown. The spending fight is a prelude to the bigger confrontation over the nation's credit limit, expected to hit its $16.7 trillion cap in mid-October. Obama on Monday urged Republicans not to saddle the legislation to increase the debt ceiling with measures designed to undermine the health care law. He has vowed not to negotiate over the debt ceiling, saying that a default would be worse for the economy than a partial government shutdown. On Wednesday, Obama is scheduled to meet with top Wall Street CEOs to discuss the state of the economy, including the debt ceiling. The meeting will be with members of the Financial Services Forum, a trade group representing the 19 biggest financial service institutions doing business in the United States, including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Citigroup. The Forum joined 250 other business organizations in a letter to Congress on Monday calling on lawmakers to avoid a shutdown, raise the debt ceiling and then address long-term spending issues and deficits. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blamed . House Republicans Monday for the brinksmanship that has pushed the U.S. toward a federal government shutdown .","West Wing officials have hardly spend any time planning for Monday evening's shutdown because they didn't think it would become a reality .

The superstar, worth more than £100 million, met with 90-year-old Peter Comfort to talk about his latest film Fury but the WWII veteran admitted he had to use the internet to find out who Pitt was. The famous actor had invited Mr Comfort to the set of the new blockbuster in Hertfordshire to hear a first-hand account of life inside an amphibious Sherman tank. Scroll down for video . Who are you? WWII veteran had to use Google to work out who Brad Pitt (pictured together) was before meeting him on the set of the Hollywood actor's new movie about WWII Sherman tanks . Mr Comfort went to meet him and left the film crew laughing when he admitted he had to check out who Pitt was on the internet first. He said: ‘Mr Pitt was very friendly and charming actually but I didn't know who he was. ‘I said to him “Until last night I didn't have a clue who you were and then I googled you and you've been in quite a lot of films”.’ ‘They all rolled about laughing when I said that. ‘I don't do modern films. I am a fan of actors like Alec Guinness, but of course he is dead now.’ Mr Comfort, the last Second World War survivor of the 13/18th Royal Hussars, was assigned to the Sherman tanks at just 21-years-old. Wartime thriller: Brad Pitt (centre) is starring in Fury as a commander of a DD Sherman tank alongside actors Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Michael Pena, and Jon Bernthal (pictured) He landed at Sword beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944 with the tanks going into the water 500 yards from the shore, something the Germans had not seen before.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:35 EST, 19 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:01 EST, 19 September 2013 . For more than 60 years, historians and literary researchers have wondered about the identity of Hannah Crafts, the mysterious author of 'The Bondwoman's Narrative'. The 'Bondwoman's Narrative' is an account of life as a house slave written in the 1850s, but was only discovered in 1948. While the account has been verified, until recently the author's identity has alluded experts. Case solved: A professor in South Carolina claims to have ended the 60-year mystery surrounding the life of 'The Bondwoman's Narrative' author Hannah Crafts, who wrote about life as a slave after escaping the south . Yesterday, in the New York Times, a professor in South Carolina stepped forward saying he finally traced Crafts' roots back to a woman named Hannah Bond, who lived a very similar life as the novel's protagonist. End of Story: Winthop University professor Gregg Hecimovich traced Hannah Crafts origins to a slave born in North Carolina named Hannah Bond . Dorothy Parker Wesley, a Howard University black history archivist, discovered the manuscript in 1948 at a New York City bookseller and bought the book for $85. More than 50 years later in 2001, the manuscript went up for auction and was won for $8,500 by African-American historian Henry Louis Gates. Within a year, Mr Gates verified the manuscript and said it was written before 1861 since there was no mention of the war or secession. Other experts agreed after analyzing the ink and paper. Publishers were quick to snap up the rights to the narrative with a female perspective of life as a slave and in 2002 it was published by Warner Books. But without a confirmed identity for the author, literary researchers found it hard to make any sort of statement on the account. 'I think there was some suspended judgement because we didn't have a traceable historical person,' William Andrews, an English professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill told the Times. 'We had leads. We had all sorts of interesting inferences. But we couldn't talk about the book without any confidence of authorial intention if we didn't know who the author was.' Professor Gregg Hecimovich, a Victorian literature expert at Winthrop University, seems to have made the most convincing pitch so far: Hannah Crafts was really Hannah Bond. He came to this conclusion after conducting interviews and studying wills, diaries, handwritten almanacs and public records which led him to the slave who worked at the plantation owned by John Hill Wheeler in Murfreesboro, North Carolina. Wheeler was a prominent North Carolinian who would go on to serve as North Carolina State Treasurer and the United States Minister to Nicaragua. Bond was a self-educated woman who waited on the lady of the house, Ellen Wheeler. But in 1867 she escaped, dressed as a man in a suit, possibly given to her by a Wheeler family member. Clues: Left, a picture of Plantation owner John Wheeler. The plantation often took boarders from a local school where they had to memorize excerpts of Charles Dickens' Bleak House, which is referenced in Crafts' book . She escaped first to Upstate New York before eventually settling in New Jersey, marrying, and becoming a school teacher. In Upstate New York she was sheltered by a family by the last name of Crafts, hence the author's pseudonym. Mr Gates, the manuscript's owner, believes the conclusion and so do other respected African American historians. Hollis Robbins of John Hopkins University called it a 'tremendous finding'. Robbins said she was 'totally convinced' Bonds is Crafts 'to the extent that anything historical can be documented without an iPhone picture of her writing the novel.' Mr Hecimovich plans to publish his case in a book tentatively titled 'The Life and Times of Hannah Crafts'. It may be that I assume to[o] much responsibility in attempting to write these pages. The world will probably say so, and I am aware of my deficiencies. I am neither clever, nor learned, nor talented. When a child they used to scold and find fault with me because they said I was dull and stupid. Perhaps under other circumstances and with more encouragement I might have appeared better; for I was shy and reserved and scarce dared open my lips to any one I had none of that quickness and animation which are so much admired in children, but rather a silent unobtrusive way of observing things and events, and wishing to understand them better than I could.I was not brought up by any body in particular that I know of. I had no training, no cultivation. The birds of the air, or beasts of the field are not freer from moral culture than I was. No one seemed to care for me till I was able to work, and then it was Hannah do this and Hannah do that, but I never complained as I found a sort of pleasure and something to divert my thoughts in employment. Of my relatives I knew nothing. No one ever spoke of my father or mother, but I soon learned what a curse was attached to my race, soon learned that the African blood in my veins would forever exclude me from the higher walks of life. That toil unremitted unpaid toil must be my lot and portion, without even the hope or expectation of any thing better. This seemed the harder to be borne, because my complexion was almost white, and the obnoxious descent could not be readily traced, though it gave a rotundity to my person, a wave and curl to my hair, and perhaps led me to fancy pictorial illustrations and flaming colors.The busiest life has its leisure moments; it was so with mine. I had from the first an instinctive desire for knowledge and the means of mental improvement. Though neglected and a slave, I felt the immortal longings in me. In the absence of books and teachers and schools I determined to learn if not in a regular, approved, and scientific way. I was aware that this plan would meet with opposition, perhaps with punishment. My master never permitted his slaves to be taught. Education in his view tended to enlarge and expand their ideas; made them less subservient to their superiors, and besides that its blessings were destined to be conferred exclusively on the higher and nobler race. Indeed though he was generally easy and good-tempered, there was nothing liberal or democratic in his nature. Slaves were slaves to him, and nothing more. Practically he regarded them not as men and women, but in the same light as horses or other domestic animals. He furnished supplied their necessities of food and clothing from the same motives of policy, but [di]scounted the ideas of equality and fraternity as preposterous and absurd. Of course I had nothing to expect from him, yet 'where there's a will there's a way.'","In 1948, a black history archivist found the manuscript for 'The Bondwoman's Narrative' a semi-autobiographical account of life as a house slave in North Carolina .

Sergei Polunin's reputation as an astonishing talent is matched only by his image as a temperamental 'bad boy' He is an intense, charismatic and ambitious ballet prodigy who became the Royal Ballet’s youngest ever principal at the age of 19. But Sergei Polunin’s reputation  as an astonishing talent is matched only by his image as a temperamental ‘bad boy’ who has walked out of not one, but two London productions. He sent shockwaves through the dance world in April when he quit a much anticipated adaptation of Midnight Express – barely a year after he stormed out of the Royal Ballet, where he wowed in productions such as Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland. At the time of his latest walkout, Polunin cited an unspecified ‘health issue’ for abandoning the London Coliseum production. But now producers are suing him for £400,000, claiming it was his wild partying that left him in no condition to perform. Legal papers filed at the High Court accuse the troubled 23-year-old Ukrainian and his mentor Igor Zelensky, who also quit the production, of indulging ‘in a lifestyle which was not conducive to maintaining a sound state of health’. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of producers Peter Schaufuss Ballet, continues: ‘They engaged in intensive and potentially debilitating social activity.’ The brilliant but erratic Polunin – who co-owns a London tattoo parlour – will have difficulty claiming a monastic devotion to his art. When he abruptly fled the Royal Ballet in 2012, he revealed he had spent his nights clubbing, had taken drugs, and that he sometimes cut himself with razors for the adrenaline rush. He has also admitted dancing while high on cocaine. The legal papers reveal that the two dancers were due to be paid £7,000 for seven performances as American drug smugglers Billy and Tex – but they were also obliged to rehearse for two weeks before the show, for which they would each be paid £1,400. Accused: Polunin in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. He revealed he had spent his nights clubbing, had taken drugs, and that he sometimes cut himself with razors . When Polunin and Zelensky failed  to appear, the dance company was forced to hire two replacements, refund tickets worth £14,000 and reprint promotional material. Producers also claim that ticket sales slumped when it became known that Polunin and Zelensky would not be dancing – a loss the company put ‘in the region of £400,000’. To make matters worse, it is believed the Peter Schaufuss company had neglected to take out the usual insurance against the non-appearance of its stars. According to the papers, both dancers emailed producers medical letters stating that they were not fit to work – but neither responded to the producers’ request to attend a medical examination. Polunin is now working in Moscow but due to perform  at a gala at London’s Sadler’s Wells theatre tonight. Neither dancer has commented on the legal action, but Polunin’s mother Galina said from Kiev:  ‘As I understand, neither side will be making public statements. I don’t know what their defence will be.’ Peter Schaufuss  did not return calls, while the company’s solicitors would not comment.","Sergei Polunin sent shockwaves through dance world after walkout .

However, Mr Cameron insisted last night that Britain was ‘going from rescue to recovery’, adding: ‘The public understand the mess we were left... they know we have been doing a rescue mission.

A leading cancer specialist was today cleared of killing a 21-year-old cyclist while driving on the wrong side of the road. Dr Helen Measures wept as jurors delivered their 'not guilty' verdict after just over three hours of deliberations. She had been trying to overtake two other cyclists in her red Mini but collided with waitress Denisa Perinova, who was on a bike ride with her new boyfriend. Cleared: Dr Helen Measures (left) was today cleared of causing the death of 21-year-old Denise Perinova (right) The 21-year-old, originally from Czech Republic, lost control after partner Ben Pontin, ahead of her, slowed to avoid the car, Oxford Crown Court was told. Riding the bike Mr Pontin had bought her four days before, she was flung 15 yards away and, despite wearing a helmet, died in hospital from severe head injuries a week later. Dr Measures denied a single charge of causing death by careless driving in relation to the incident on July 15 last year. The divorced mother-of-four was travelling back from visiting a garden centre, driving at 40-50mph, with her four-year-old daughter and boyfriend when the tragedy unfolded near to her home in Henley-on-Thames. With a doctorate in oncology, she has worked as a scientist for leading pharmaceutical companies for the past 30 years. The former parish church bell ringer said she was 'surprised' to see Mr Pontin and his girlfriend suddenly emerge coming towards her as she rounded the curve in the road - but felt they still had enough room to get past. 'I had to make a decision of what to do,' she said. 'I felt the safest decision was to continue straight ahead because they were in single file. 'If I had been concerned, I would have stopped suddenly.' A keen cyclist herself, she told the court: 'I can’t help it if a cyclist, with all due respect, falls over as I’m approaching them and comes into my line of travel.' Victim: Miss Perinova, here with her parents and younger brother, died after losing control of her new bike . The first cyclist, Mr Pontin, went past her. However, Miss Perinova came at her at a 'right angle' after losing control of her bike. It was unclear whether the young Czech woman had actually been struck by the defendant’s Mini but the other pair of cyclists claim they heard an impact.

Not guilty: Judge Patrick Eccles told a tearful Dr Measures to leave the dock after a jury returned their verdict . She was initially rushed to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading before being transferred to a specialist neurological unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where she later died. Mr Pontin had earlier told the jury he saw Dr Measures make a 'stupid manoeuvre' in front of them on a bend in the A415. Describing the moment the oncoming car overtook the cyclists on the opposite side of the road, he said: 'I just couldn’t believe the person driving had overtaken at that point.' Mr Pontin said he was forced to aim for a 'tiny' gap and then felt his girlfriend’s wheel touch the back of his bike before looking around and seeing she had been flung away in the collision. Judge Patrick Eccles told an emotional Dr Measures she could leave, cleared, after the verdict was returned.","Dr Helen Measures, 51, was overtaking other cyclists on an Oxford road .

Venus, however, has none. A wild new theory presented at a Royal Society conference is claiming that Earth may have stolen its only moon from Venus. The theory, put forward by a Caltech University professor, suggests that Earth pulled Venus's moon out of Venus' orbit and into our own. Scroll down for video... Earth may have stolen its only moon from Venus, according a wild new theory presented at the Royal Society . Dave Stevenson, professor of planetary science at Caltech, told the Origin of the Moon conference in London that the moon’s size shows that this could have been possible. He noted that our moon is much larger compared to our planet than other satellites are to their planets. ‘The reason why it's interesting is that Earth and Venus are close to each other,’ Stevenson told Space.com. ‘They have similar mass, and people think they have probably formed in a similar way. VIDEO: The evolution of the moon . One major flaw is the geological similarities between samples found from Earth and the moon. These samples lend themselves more to a the ¿giant impact¿ theory which suggests that the moon formed when a planet, around the size of Mars, collided with Earth around 4.56 billion years ago . Venus is slightly than Earth with a similar mass. It is the second closest planet to the sun at a distance of about 108 million km. One day on Venus lasts as long as 243 Earth days. Its thick and toxic atmosphere is made up mostly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, with clouds of sulphuric acid droplets. No evidence for life has been found on Venus. The planet's extreme high temperatures of almost 480 degrees Celsius make it seem an unlikely place for for life as we know it. ‘So the question is, if Earth and Venus formed in similar ways, how come the Earth has a Moon and Venus doesn't?’ Professor Stevenson added that he isn’t convinced by the theory but said it was an ‘interesting possibility’. One major flaw in the theory is the geological similarities between samples found from Earth and the moon. These samples lend themselves more to a the ‘giant impact’ theory which suggests that the moon formed when a planet, around the size of Mars, collided with Earth around 4.56 billion years ago. This collision divided Earth into two unequal parts. The smaller of these condensed into the moon. The best simulations of this process suggest that about 80 per cent of moon ought to have come from the impactor and 20 per cent from the Earth. Another controversial new theory suggests a giant explosion equivalent to 40 billion atomic bombs, originating from the Earth's core, somehow led to the formation of the moon. Planetary scientist Wim van Westrenen believes this violent event took place approximately four-and-a-half billion years ago. Van Westeren said that taken at face value, the findings suggest that the moon was once part of the Earth that was blasted into space by an enormous explosion from the Earth's fiery core.","Caltech Uni theory could explain why Earth has a moon and Venus doesn't .

The Jablonski name conjures impressive modeling associations like million-dollar beauty contracts, Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show features, and Giorgio Armani campaigns. In the last four years Jacquelyn and Constance Jablonski, who are not related, have simultaneously built their status as supermodels with the same exact surname. Now, a third unrelated Jablonski has emerged onto the scene. High school student Maggie Jablonski follows in the footsteps of Constance, 22, an Estée Lauder spokeswoman and Jacquelyn, also 22, Tommy Hilfiger's long-running face. Both are industry veterans who have walked in the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show—modeling’s highest distinction—a number of times. Fresh face: Maggie Jablonski, pictured above in one of her agency Polaroids, is set to elevate the Jablonski name to the next level . Together, they’ve established the Jablonski name as modeling’s gilded moniker. It’s a distinction that Maggie should find immensely helpful. Now in her first runway season, she has already walked for the likes of Marc Jacobs, Marni, and 3.1 Phillip Lim. Hailing from Sioux City, Iowa, a place she says is ‘full of corn,’ Maggie is poised to elevate the lofty name to the next level. While the Jablonski surname already offers inimitable beauty on tap, Maggie’s look is quite different, setting her apart from the other two. Constance’s French-bred flaxen hair and doe-eyed appearance have earned her a coveted beauty contract, as well as campaign work with commercial European brands like Hermès and Moschino. Jacquelyn’s visibly American East Coast upbringing has paved the way for advertising contracts with classic labels including Burberry and J.Crew. Both have channeled their supermodel looks into a commercial goldmine. By contrast, Maggie’s higher-minded aesthetic (brooding eyes, chestnut hair, and a slightly skewed nose—considered a positive quirk in modeling) is carving its own aesthetic niche within the Jablonski tribe. It has already inspired the likes of artistically-inclined designers Miuccia Prada and Marc Jacobs, both of whom have cast her in their shows. When MailOnline spoke with Maggie, who stands at a lithe 5’ 10”, she had just spent the evening prior at Christian Dior’s atelier to run through looks with the label’s creative director Raf Simons. Supermodel name: Constance (L) and Jacquelyn Jablonski (R), both photographed at the Victoria's Secret Show, have simultaneously built their respective careers with the same name . ‘He is so nice,’ Maggie said of Simons by phone, her voice laden with the excitement of a bewildered teenage girl. ‘It’s so cool when you meet people like that and it’s like, “What, they aren’t crazy? They are just normal people?”’ Maggie, politely declined to provide her age (her agent admits ‘she is a young girl’), likely in caution of rules outlined by the CFDA that requests designers not to use models under the age of sixteen. 'I want to sounds like I have a background in the industry’ She says that her education in fashion is a recent one: ‘That whole interest definitely started when I got into the industry,’ she said. ‘I had to have some sort of background knowledge about it because I don’t want to sound line an unintellectual about it, I want to sounds like I have a background in the industry.’ She says that people at home in Iowa ‘Don’t really understand the fashion world—if you aren’t in a Kohl’s catalogue, they don’t really get it.’ However, ‘They are kind of learning,’ she says. ‘When I did Prada resort this past summer they were like “Oh Prada, I’ve heard of that so it must be good, right?”’ Maggie, it seems, is quickly priming herself on her new, likely alien surroundings. The words ‘industry’ and ‘career’ carried throughout our entire conversation, making it evident that the very young student--who named math as her favorite subject-- is quickly learning adapt to a world where exceeding precociousness, particularly at her age, provides a competitive edge. On the runway: Jablonski has already booked shows including Prada resort 2014 (L), and Marni spring 2014 (R) For example, Maggie says that she holds Italian Vogue as an editorial goal over its American counterpart. ‘American Vogue has more turned into celebrities [always] being on the cover but Italian Vogue is staying strong with models on the cover,’ she announced with proud inflection. Her road to early success began only last summer when she and her older sister briefly moved to New York to attempt modeling together. It’s there that Maggie learned how to pose, dress, and walk a runway. ‘I had a tough time,’ she said of her catwalk lessons. ‘I bought five different pairs of shoes to try, thinking it was the shoes [instead of me].’ ‘American Vogue has more turned into . celebrities [always] being on the cover but Italian Vogue is staying . strong with models on the cover’ After ‘the critiques on how to move your arms, when to blink, it all came together,’ she says. ‘My dad pushed me more than anyone else…every night he would come into my room and say “you need to walk.”’ He was also her introduction to modeling’s other two Jablonski’s. Maggie recalls that after her father found Jacquelyn and Constance’s profiles on the widely-used site, Models.com (which serves as a Style.com-type resource for the modeling industry) he came to her and said ‘They have two other Jablonski’s you know.’ While Maggie has yet to meet Constance and Jacquelyn, both of whom now reserve their runway appearances for major (higher-paying) brands like Michael Kors and Dolce & Gabbana, she says that she ‘cannot wait for the day’ that they finally cross paths. More Accolades: Maggie, who is now in Paris looking to book more big runway shows, was also cast in Marc by Marc Jacobs (L) and 3.1 Phillip Lim (R) That milestone shouldn't too be far off. Following a one-year hiatus from modeling, Maggie returned to New York this past June with new Polaroid images that drew the attention of reputable casting agents around the city. ‘Within minutes of sending them out, we got major responses,’ her American agent, Domonick Hannosh at Major Models, told MailOnline. Mere weeks later Maggie was cast as an ‘exclusive’ in the Prada resort 2014 show, a distinction that has launched the careers of many top models. A few months later she was cast in the Phillip Lim, Marc by Marc Jacobs, MM6, and Marc Jacobs’s spring 2014 shows at New York Fashion Week. She followed that up by skipping the London shows and flying straight to Milan where she booked spots in Marni and MSGM’s line-ups. Maggie is now in Paris, her first visit to the city, in the hopes of booking major shows there as well. 'It’s so crazy to think that two other . people have the same last name as me...especially since . Jablonski is not that common of a last name’ ‘Most people don’t get these kinds of opportunities, I get to see the world and get to go to Italy and Paris,’ she said. ‘Even New York is a big deal where I’m from.’ On the brink of what could be a lightening career, Maggie admits that many of her aspirations mirror those of her namesake colleagues. ‘I look up to them so much,’ she said of Constance and Jacquelyn. Last week, she ‘was in Milan and I was walking by the Armani building and Jacquelyn was on a billboard. I was like “Oh my god that is Jacquelyn Jablonski!” ‘I feel like we have some sort of relation even though we don’t,’ she admitted. ‘It’s so crazy to think that two other people have the same last name as me in this industry, especially since Jablonski is not that common of a last name.’ But Maggie is the first one to assert: ‘I’m hoping to be the third successful one.’","The high school student has already walked in shows by Prada, Marc Jacobs, and Marni .

Starbucks is facing a boycott of its branches after it emerged it has paid nothing in tax in the past three years. The coffee chain, which has paid just £8.6million to the Treasury in 14 years of trading in Britain despite sales of £3 billion, is facing a backlash organised by angry consumers. Britons on Twitter have started messages about Starbucks with the hashtags #taxdodgers and #boycottStarbucks as thousands pledged to avoid its 735 British outlets. It uses a range of complicated measures to minimise its profits – and its tax bill. These include paying large royalties to another arm of the firm for using the brand name. Financial practices: Incredibly, in the last three years, Starbucks - a company that prides itself on its ethical standards and values - paid no UK tax at all despite racking up sales of £1.2billion . Over the past three years the company, . which prides itself on its ethical standards, paid no UK tax at all . despite racking up sales of £1.2billion. During 2011, the most recent year for . which figures are available, the group posted a UK loss of £33million on . sales of £398million. Because of this it paid no corporation tax. By comparison, McDonald’s racked up a . 2011 tax bill of £80million on £3.6billion of sales and KFC paid . £36million on sales of £1.1billion. Many have taken to Twitter to show their anger and encourage others to stop buying their drinks.

'Everbody please boycott Starbucks until they decide to do fair . accounting and pay some UK tax.' 'Starbucks has paid no tax in last 3 yrs; . every1 should boycott them.

Starbucks is the second largest . restaurant or café chain in the world after McDonald’s but now claims to . have made no profit in the UK over the past ten years. Despite the figures, executives have told investors that the UK business is profitable. In 2011, it paid £26million in . royalties and licence fees to let the UK coffee houses serve Starbucks . products and use its labelling. Queuing up: Starbucks uses a plethora of complicated measures to minimise its offering to the taxman . It does this by registering the . intellectual property rights to another division of the company, which . charges hefty royalties of 6 per cent on each cup of coffee. 'They are trying to play the taxman, game him. It is disgraceful' Michael Meacher, Labour MP who campaigns against tax avoidance . In another complicated manoeuvre, . Starbucks buys its coffee beans for all its European divisions through a . firm based in Lausanne in Switzerland. Before the beans reach the UK . they are shipped to Amsterdam to be roasted. Experts who have studied the figures say the supply chain is a way of pushing profits around the world. The third way in which Starbucks is . thought to shrink its UK tax take is by funding its British division . entirely by loans. These are taken out from another part of the group, . although the company’s labyrinthine structure means that it is not known . where. The interest on these loans will be charged to the UK arm at an . unusually high rate, according to experts. Rival: Starbucks is the second largest restaurant or café chain in the world after McDonald's but claims to have made no profit in the UK over the last ten years . All of the practices deployed by Starbucks are legal. The company’s US reports show that it . incurred a tax rate of 31 per cent on its profits there last year.

A woman from Argentina has become the first heart transplant patient in the world to give birth to a daughter following IVF treatment. Juliana Finondo, 39, from Buenos Aires, had a successful heart transplant in 1999, but was childless at the time. She gave birth to baby Emilia earlier this month with the help of staff at the high risk pregnancy centre in Buenos Aires. Juliana Finondo, 39, kisses her newborn daughter Emilia next to her husband Gerardo Tuya, in Buenos Aires . New father Gerardo Tuya holds baby Emilia with heart transplant recipient mother Juliana Finondo . Doctors warned Ms Finondo against trying . for a baby following surgery because pregnancy causes women to have 40 . per cent more blood, putting extra strain on her new heart. Juliana Finondo had been told pregnancy would put strain on her heart . Gustavo Leguizamon, head of the Buenos Aires high . risk pregnancy centre, said: 'There is no record in the world of a . transplant patient who has achieved pregnancy through in vitro . fertilization. 'This could lead to not enough blood . getting to the uterus, causing the baby to grow less.' Mr Leguizamon said a premature birth was also a possible risk. Drugs which help avoid new organs being rejected by transplant patients make pregnancy difficult, and their effects on the unborn child are unknown. Medication needed to perform IVF can cause further complications, according to Ricardo James, a reproductive specialist at the centre. But the health risks did not put off graphic designer Ms Finondo, who was determined to have a child with her husband, Gerardo Tuya. She told AFP:  'I was never afraid. Maybe I'm too optimistic.'

In 2009 Ms Finondo decided to try to get pregnant, but by 2011 she had still had no success in conceiving naturally. After a medical examination to check she showed no signs of rejecting her heart, doctors weaned her off transplant medication, so she could use fertility drugs needed for IVF. Ms Finondo got pregnant on her first round of IVF, and after nine months of monitoring gave birth to her healthy daughter on January 15. Ms Finondo's cardiologist Sergio Perrone said: 'Today a transplant patient has an excellent quality of life, much better than people realize.' He said he also hoped the story would encourage people to consider organ donation, 'because it saves one life, which can be multiplied by so many more.' He added that baby Emilia 'will become a mother in her time'. In Argentina, last year 630 people donated organs to 1,458 patients, a record rate of 15.7 donors per million people.

Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams was today called on to explain in more detail his knowledge of his niece's abuse . Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has refused to explain why he did not tell police about his brother’s sex abuse of his niece for nine years. The republican leader claimed there was a lot of 'disinformation' as his younger brother Liam Adams awaited sentencing on November 5, in Belfast, for six years of rape attacks on his daughter Aine. Liam Adams, 58, a one-time IRA commander, was yesterday convicted of attacking his child, who waived her right to anonymity to help bring him to justice. The 40-year-old was attacked over a six-year period between 1977 and 1983 when she was aged between four and nine. Gerry Adams pointed the finger at others when he was asked about when he first became aware of the assaults and why he did not report them in 1987. He said: 'The police were aware over 20 years ago and there is a lot of disinformation being flung about in this issue. 'But let me say this, this has been and continues to be a huge ordeal for my family - we’re a very large family - especially for Aine, but for all members of my family. And I think people need to be given the space to come to terms with all of that. 'And if it was your family, you would want the same respect and space and privacy on these matters.' During the trial Aine Adams gave graphic details of the abuse, which started when she was aged four. The first rape she remembers took place while her mother was in hospital giving birth to her younger brother Conor in 1977. The allegations about Liam Adams were first made public when his daughter took part in a television documentary in 2009. Mr Adams has refused to explain why he did not tell police about his brother's sex abuse of his niece for nine years .

He . was a witness in the first trial which collapsed earlier this year. He . told Belfast Crown Court he confronted his brother when they met in . Buncrana, Co Donegal, in 1987 and that Liam Adams had denied the abuse. He then revealed his brother later confessed while they were out walking together in the rain in Dundalk, Co Louth, in 2000. Gerry Adams was not called as a prosecution witness for the latest trial, which re-opened before a new jury panel last month. Hurt: Victim Aine Adams said after the guilty verdicts she was ready to get on with her life . Called . on to explain in more detail his knowledge of his niece’s abuse today . and whether he has a relationship with her, Mr Adams refused to discuss . the case further. 'I’m . not going to talk about any of these matters beyond what I have said. It . has been a very difficult ordeal for everybody in the family,' he said. Mr Adams was asked to explain why he . did not warn authorities in Co Louth in 2003 that allegations had been . made about his brother, who was working with children in Dundalk at the . time. Revelations: Gerry Adams niece Aine allowed herself to be named for a 2009 documentary (pictured) where she accused her father of years of abuse . Mr Adams went on to be elected for the Irish parliament for the area in 2011. 'I . have answered all of those questions in some detail, in a number of . very extensive interviews. The trial is only over yesterday. I have said . what I need to say on all of that and we just need a bit of space to . come to terms with that,' he said. The Sinn Fein leader also rejected local media headlines which questioned whether he was fit for public office. 'Thankfully that isn’t in the hands of the Belfast Telegraph. That’s in the hands of citizens,' he said. 'I’m . very proud and privileged to represent the people of Louth and to . represent Sinn Fein. I don’t take that for granted.

The crowning of the creator of the iPhone as the leading global brand is striking testimony to the increasing power of technology compared to traditional powerhouses such as car companies. Google came second in the list compiled by consultancy Interbrand, with Coca-Cola, IBM and Microsoft rounding out the top five. Revolution: Tech brands have overtaken more established firms in the Interbrand table of the most valuable brands, as this graph shows . Coke, which has become an icon of . globalisation and consumer society, has been top of the list every year . since it was first published in 2000. But . Apple's devotion to sleek design and Google's almost universal . popularity as the world's top search engine helped them surpass the . 127-year-old drink for the first time. Despite . the death of Apple's visionary founder Steve Jobs in 2011, the firm's . brand value has continued to rise, according to Interbrand, soaring 28 . per cent in a year to reach $98.3billion. Google's brand is worth $93.3billion - up 34 per cent on last year - with Coca-Cola worth $79.2billion. Valuable: Apple, whose latest product launch this month is pictured, has been named the world's top brand . Devotion: Apple has inspired a fanatical fanbase who flock to its stores following product launches . 1) Apple - $98.3bn . 2) Google - $93.2bn . 3) Coca-Cola - $79.2bn . 4) IBM - $78.8bn . 5) Microsoft - $59.5bn . 6) GE - $46.9bn . 7) McDonald's - $42.0bn . 8) Samsung - $39.6bn . 9) Intel - $37.3bn . 10) Toyota - $35.3bn           Source: Interbrand . When the Interbrand list debuted in 2000, Apple occupied 36th place with a brand value of $6.6billion - behind even the likes of Kodak. But the introduction of the iPod, iPad and iPhone - which now accounts for one in 10 of all phones sold worldwide - has increased the value of its brand by more than 15 times. Paying tribute to Apple's sucess, Interbrand CEO Jez Frampton said: 'Every so often, a company changes our lives - not just with its products, but with its ethos. This is why, following Coca-Cola’s 13-year run at the top of Best Global Brands, Apple now ranks #1.' Not only does Apple have the world's best brand, it is also the most valuable company in the U.S., with a market capitalisation of more than $400billion. Decline: Coca-Cola has been knocked from its perch as the most valuable company in the world after 13 years . Classic: Coke has long been an icon of globalisation and U.S. consumer culture . McDonald's, another firm considered to be an icon of American consumer culture, came in seventh on this year's list. The only brands in the top 10 to come from outside the U.S. were Samsung, based in South Korea, and Japanese carmaker Toyota. The top European brands were Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Louis Vuitton and H&M. Among British firms, the most valuable . brand is apparently HSBC, which occupied 32nd place on Interbrand's . list, with Burberry, Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff the UK's only other . contributions to the top 100. Runner-up: Google came second in the list compiled every year by consultancy Interbrand . The fastest riser was Facebook, whose brand value increased by 43 per cent to propel it to no. 52 on the list. By contrast, the value of Nokia's brand tumbled by two thirds in just one year after the firm was sold to Microsoft, taking it from 19th place to 57th. The fall of Nokia, along with other tech firms such as Yahoo! and Blackberry, is a reminder that the value of brands can change rapidly in the volatile sector, implying that Apple and Google may not stay at the top for too long. The total value of all the brands in Interbrand's top 100 came to $1.5trillion, 8.4 per cent higher than last year despite the continuing effects of the global financial crisis and subsequent recession.","Maker of the iPhone tops global list of valuable brands at $93.3billion .

WWE wrestler Darren Young revealed he’s gay because he wanted to be more public with his relationship. The first openly-gay professional wrestler, Mr Young made the announcement to a reporter on a whim while waiting for luggage at Los Angeles International Airport. Though he initially regretted it, the New Jersey native now thinks it’s the best decision he’s ever made. Mr Young, 29, opened up about his decision and the happiness it’s brought him to People magazine, as well as wanting boyfriend Niccolo ‘Nick’ Villa to attend WWE events. 'I was tired of hiding': Darren Young came out as publicly gay because he no longer wnated to live a double life . Explaining that he was ‘tired of hiding, the wrestler told the magazine he ‘wanted to be able to take him with me to WWE functions.’ The wrestler wanted to be able to go out to dinner without looking over his shoulder, hold hands in public, the things heterosexual couples do without hesitation, he told People . The decision to come out wasn’t an easy one, Mr Young explained to People. Family and close friends found out in 2011, but he still lived a ‘double life’ that made him less happy than he felt he ought to be. As a reporter approached him earlier this year at LAX, Mr Young decided to tell the world he’s gay. Telling People it was an ‘impulsive’ decision, the WWE star explained how he soon second-guessed his move. The other half: Mr Young has been in a relationship with Niccolo 'Nick' Villa for about two years . ‘I went straight to my hotel room and I was sick as a dog, throwing up and crying,’ said Mr Young. ‘O was terrified of how people would perceive me.’ ‘I said to myself, ‘what the hell did I just do?’ Mr Young remembered. Talking to WWE honchos helped him relax a bit, the organization stood behind him 100 per cent – and so did his wrestling partner. ‘His sexual orientation never had anything to do with him as a person, and at the end of the day it shouldn’t matter,’ Titus O’Neill told People. It doesn't make any difference: Titus O'Neill (pictured right), Mr Young's partner in the ring, said his sexual orientation is a non-issue, that 'it shouldn't matter' Wrestling fans, often belonging to more conservative demographics, have also supported Mr Young.His first match after his announcing he was gay couldn’t have been more uplifting. ‘At first, I didn’t know how people were going to respond to me,’ Mr Young recalled, ‘[but] the place erupted with cheers. I got goosebumps.’ The support has only grown stronger, fans have embraced the first known-gay WWE performer, which Mr Young says ‘is freaking awesome.’ The mostly positive public support has been met with online vitriol, which Mr Young lamented is a ‘daily struggle,’ but it doesn’t match the positive vibes he feels on a daily basis. ‘It’s such a good feeling to be open now,’ Mr Young said. ‘It was such a relief, I’m living the dream.’","Darren Young is the first openly-gay professional wrestler .

The parents of Baby Lisa have said they are still hopeful the little girl will be returned to them - two years after she vanished from their Missouri home in the middle of the night. Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, who will hold a candle-lit vigil on Saturday to mark two years since the disappearance, have also worked with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children to release an image of what Lisa could look like now, in the hope it will reinvigorate the case. Despite the family's determination, authorities in Kansas City said tips into the disappearance have waned since the months after she vanished on October 4, 2011. Missing: Lisa Irwin was just 10 months old when she vanished from her parents' home in Kansas City in 2011 - and two years on her family has not given up home. Right, how she could look today . 'I cannot force the people who know where . Lisa is and who might have her into telling us. I have no control over . that,' Bradley told the Kansas City Star. 'You do what you can for your baby, because it is . your job as a parent to protect your child, and I wasn’t able to protect . her from the bad guys.' Lisa was 10-months-old when her father returned from a late work shift to find the front door open, the lights on, Bradley asleep, his daughter's bedroom window open and her crib empty. They believe that someone broke into the home and snatched the baby while Bradley slept, and have said they think someone is bringing up the little girl as their own. Heartbroken: Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin, pictured after her disappearance, believe she was taken so that someone else could bring her up as their own.

'When . somebody abducts an infant, they don't take them to hurt them,' she . said. 'Wherever she is, she is being loved and taken well care of, . because they went through a hell of a lot of trouble to get her.' She said that she knows people have pointed fingers at them for the disappearance but she maintained their innocence - and said it will be proven when the little girl returns to them. A private investigator continues to work on the case, and the family still offers a $100,000 reward for anyone who has information that could bring the baby home. Bradley said she still hands over tips she receives to the police. Have you seen her? Police said they now receive about one tip a week in the case of the missing baby . Where is she?

Kayleigh Renwick was forced to cancel her wedding plans when she gave birth just hours after finding out that she was pregnant . Most brides dread something unexpected happening on their big day - the flowers not turning up or the rain pouring down. But those minor issues pale in comparison to one young mother - who was forced to cancel her wedding plans when she gave birth just hours after finding out that she was pregnant - for the second time. Kayleigh Renwick, 24, was unaware she was pregnant when she went into labour and gave birth to a son last Saturday. But what might sound like a once-in-a-lifetime shock was actually familiar territory for the young mum and her partner Daniel Madge, 34. Just 18-months-ago Kayleigh gave birth to her daughter Lucy, five weeks past her due date - having had no idea that she was pregnant. Now the proud parents, who have another daughter Grace, three, have welcomed baby Jacob into the brood - born just 12 minutes after his worried mum arrived at the hospital. The couple, who have been together for seven years, had spent the last eighteen months battling to make it down the aisle. But the unexpected arrival of Lucy, on May 14, 2012, saw them cancel their booking at Durham register office and swap their nuptials for nappies. Only last week Kayleigh and Daniel resumed making wedding plans, which have now been put on hold again after the weekend's unexpected arrival. Just six months before Jake's surprise . birth - when Kayleigh was two months pregnant - she and Daniel decided . that they weren't going to have any more children and gave away all of . their baby supplies. Just 18-months-ago Kayleigh, seen with partner Daniel Madge, gave birth to her daughter Lucy, five weeks past her due date - having had no idea that she was pregnant . But . after finishing work at 12.30am on Saturday morning after a long shift . in a working men's club, Kayleigh started to feel pain in her back at . her home in Stanley, County Durham. The pain became so severe as the night progressed that Daniel phoned an ambulance - by which point baby Jacob was already crowning. Daniel, a kitchen fitter, said: 'The nurse told me to check down there and I got a shock and a half. 'I’m not a midwife but I know the top of a head when I see one. 'Kayleigh was crying her eyes out. 'Lucy and Grace were climbing all over trying to see what was going on. 'She was just saying, ""It can't be happening again, you're wrong"". Surprise! Lucy, aged 18 months, and baby Jacob were both unexpected arrivals for their parents . Jacob was born at 6.40 am, and weighed a healthy 7lb 13 . 'The nurse said to get towels but we haven't got a tumble dryer and they were all wet. 'I was panicking then and she said, ""You sit yourself down and breathe as well"". 'It was total deja vu.' Remarkably, Kayleigh didn’t notice putting on any weight during either pregnancy, and friends even commented that she looked to have lost a few pounds on both . occasions. Throughout both pregnancies Kayleigh was taking the contraceptive pill every day and had periods every month. Kayleigh, who also works as a nursery nurse, said: 'I just couldn’t believe it. 'I was in total shock.“Both times there had been no clues. 'On the day Lucy was born I had been to the park, done grocery shopping and been out and about - all while being in labour. 'With Jacob I had been to work all day. 'I never thought it could happen again in a million years.' Jacob was born at 6.40 am, and weighed a healthy 7lb 13 - but 7lb 7oz Lucy’s arrival last year was far more complicated. Kayleigh didn't notice putting on any weight during either pregnancy, and friends even commented that she looked to have lost a few pounds on both occasions . 'Daniel, a kitchen fitter, said: 'I got a shock and a half. I'm not a midwife but I know the top of a head when I see one' Again, Kayleigh was suffering from backache, and after arriving at the University Hospital of North Durham, found she was 8cm dilated and about to give birth. The placenta had dried and if the pregnancy had been left undetected for just a few more days, both Kayleigh and Lucy would have died. After birth, Lucy was diagnosed with plagiocephaly - a condition which means the head is misshapen - and still has to wear a helmet 23 hours a day. Kayleigh and Daniel have also missed out on two holidays after Lucy’s unexpected birth and complications with her treatment saw them cancel trips to Fuerteventura and Bulgaria, but the happy couple wouldn’t have it any other way. 'When are you ever really ready for children?' said Daniel. 'You just get on with it.

A Pennsylvania appeals court has denied a new trial for former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky after he was found guilty of sexually abusing 10 boys. The unanimous decision by a three-judge Superior Court panel on Wednesday came barely two weeks after they heard oral arguments by Sandusky's lawyer and a state prosecutor. Defense lawyer Norris Gelman said he planned to ask the state Supreme Court to review the case. Sandusky, 69, had argued his trial lawyers . did not have sufficient time to prepare, a prosecutor made improper . references to him not testifying on his own behalf and the judge . mishandled two jury instructions. Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky (shown in June 2012) may not get a new trial after being convicted of sexually abusing 10 boys . Victims who had not come forward with their . allegations during Sandusky's trial in June 2012 were granted . settlements by the Pennsylvania university yesterday . The opinion by Judge Jack Panella said trial judges have discretion about whether to allow pretrial delays, and that in Sandusky's case the judge carefully considered the continuance requests. 'The decision does not reflect a myopic insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of Sandusky's request; it was not an arbitrary denial,' Panella wrote. Sandusky had wanted the trial judge, John Cleland, to give jurors an instruction about the amount of time it took for nearly all of the victims to report their allegations. Panella wrote that Cleland should have evaluated the need for such a jury instruction based on each victim's age and maturity, but Cleland's failure to do so did not harm Sandusky. 'The trial court specifically instructed . the jury that they were to consider any possible motives of the victims . in coming forward,' Panella wrote.

A sick man: Former Penn State assistant football . coach Jerry Sandusky arrives at the Centre County Courthouse for a . post-sentencing hearing January 10, 2013 . 'The vigorous cross-examination of the victims and arguments by defense counsel, when combined with the trial court's instructions on credibility, clearly defined the issues for the jury.' The issue related to Sandusky not testifying was not properly preserved for appeals court review, Panella wrote. The appeals court also turned down . another jury instruction claim, related to weighing a defendant's good . character against the allegations.

The man who allegedly murdered his wife then posted a picture of her body on Facebook could have clashed with her after he slept in and missed a planned date night, it has emerged. Shortly before Jennifer Alonso was shot dead by Derek Medina, she sent a string of messages to a friend expressing anger with her husband and frustration over their recent marriage problems. Medina, 31, has pleaded not guilty to murder, and is expected to argue that he gunned down his wife in self-defense at their home in Miami after she had been abusing him. Turbulent relationship: Troubles in Derek Medina and Jennifer Alonso's marriage are revealed in Facebook messages released by police . Gruesome: Derek Medina was arrested after admitting to killing his wife on Facebook and posting a grisly photo of her body lying on the kitchen floor . Facebook messages between Ms Alonso, 26, and her friend Kelly Barry reveal that the alleged victim was upset with her husband in the hours before her death on August 8, according to the Miami Herald. Shortly after 7am, she wrote: 'Dude... der [Medina] was supposed to wake us up last night. To watch a movie. He promised me... I feel like I'm begging for him to hang out with us. I already know what his excuse is going to be - that his alarm didn't go off.' She added: 'He doesn't give a s***. He called me a b**** LOL... I feel like I want to leave.' After the two friends had discussed the matter for a while, Ms Alonso thanked Ms Barry for calming her down, writing: 'I felt like ripping his face off an hour ago.' She then added: 'He just woke up. He came in the room, and then he walked out. Didn't say anything... I need to calm down because I feel like I'm about to explode.' It is thought that Medina could argue self-defense in the case, claiming that his wife cut him with a knife before he killed her . Domestic abuse: There is speculation Medina's legal team will claim the killing was in self-defense . The messages stopped around 10am, just a few minutes before Medina is believed to have shot Ms Alonso before photographing her body and posting the pictures on his Facebook page. Ms Barry passed a record of the exchange to investigators last month, saying it 'might be helpful to you'. Ms Alonso herself recorded her stormy relationship with Medina - whom she divorced last year before remarrying him three months later - in a diary with the title, 'The mind of an insane woman'. She wrote: 'When we love each other it's GREAT. But when we hate each other we HATE each other.' Home surveillance footage released last month by prosecutors does not show the fatal exchange which happens out of the frame. But Medina claims he shot her in self-defence after she started hitting him 'several times with a closed fist,' according to police documents seen by the Miami Herald. This image was taken from the Facebook page identified as belonging to Derek Medina . The video shows Alfonso in the kitchen at the sink. When Medina enters, the couple move out of the frame, but at one point Medina's head is seen flinching backwards. Medina claims his wife had grabbed a knife and he had disarmed her and put the knife back in a drawer, but then she started punching him. Then the footage shows Medina leave . the kitchen and come straight back. He told police he went upstairs to . get a gun, according to the Miami Herald. Moments later white particles fly past the lens in several clouds, a sign of gunfire. Medina then walks out of the kitchen, comes back holding his phone and pauses in the doorway. As . he walks away again the light from his phone is on. This is when, . police say, he took the photo of the body. All the while Alfonso's . ten-year-old daughter from another relationship was upstairs. She was . unhurt. Medina is seen coming into the kitchen shortly after Alfonso moves away from the sink. A brief exchange is seen in the corner of the frame, before the debris flies past the camera lens . He then gets a jacket and returns to the kitchen entrance and looks again in the direction of the body as he puts it on. Calmly, he leaves the property. The next frame is of police and paramedics arriving at the couple's home. A Facebook post from Medina read 'Rip Jennifer Alfonso' alongside a picture of her slumped backwards on the kitchen floor. He . wrote on his Facebook page: 'I’m going to prison or death sentence for . killing my wife. Love you guys. Miss you guys. Take care. Facebook . people you’ll see me in the news.' Medina . claims his wife was abusive. He wrote on Facebook: 'My wife was . punching me and I am not going to stand anymore with the abuse so I did . what I did I hope u understand me.' Medina's . lawyers have asked to photograph markings such as cuts and bruises on . Alfonso's body. It is presumed Medina will claim the killing was in . self-defence. The diary of . his late wife has also been been seized by police. Some entries are . happy while others highlight the difficult nature of their relationship. She . admits she struggled with feelings of jealousy and believed he was . looking at other women. Her entries also reveal how she struggled with . her confidence and one one occasion 'negative thoughts and memories . plagued her mind'. Smoke and debris: Clouds of gun smoke and debris can be seen on home surveillance footage in the Derek Medina murder trial, in which Medina, who has confessed to shooting his wife, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder . After calmly putting on his jacket, Medina then left the property, captured on a different camera . According to the Miami-Dade affidavit the couple had been squabbling since they woke up on the morning of the shooting. At . about 10am, Alfonso was upstairs, and Medina threatened her with his . .380-caliber pistol. The shooting happened later when Alfonso was in the . kitchen. Medina's father, . Derek, to whom he confessed to shortly after the shooting, told the Herald: 'They are making my son out to be a monster and it was the . other way around. She pushed him to the point of insanity.' Medina was a part-time extra on the USA Network show Burn Notice. The . wannabe star boasted online about his tiny bit-part appearances and . dreamed of fame that he never quite attained. He appeared only as a . background extra with his head-shaved and pouting in two episodes in . 2010. He has also . self-published a number of self-help e-books, one titled: 'How I Saved .

The Atlanta Braves fan who died last month after falling over 80 feet during a game at the team’s stadium climbed an out of the way railing and jumped, according to a just-released autopsy. Ronald Lee Homer Jr’s death was ruled a suicide last month, but the chilling details weren’t made public until now. It has also been revealed the 30-year-old discussed another fatal fall at the ballpark with friends. The Fulton County Medical Examiner’s report details how Mr Homer climbed over the Turner Field railing, one leg at a time, and then jumped feet-first, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He landed on the players parking lot. Suicidal: At least one friend told investigators he thought Ronald Lee Homer Jr was suicidal . ‘The departure railing was not in an area typically accessed by visitors to the ball park, and the decedent made a conscious decision to go there without his friends,’ Dr Michele Stauffenberg wrote. ‘Therefore, it is unlikely the decedent was deceived as to the danger of this act,’ she continued. The lifelong Braves fan also discussed with friends a 2008 death at the park resulting from a fan’s fall from the upper deck, said the report. At least one friend admitted to investigators that he believed the tormented man was suicidal, the report said. Where it happened: Fans peer over the railing Mr Homer jumped 85 feet to his death, landing on the player parking lot below . Though Mr Homer’s blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit, drinking is not believed to have contributed to the fatal fall, according to the report. ‘Alcohol intoxication may have played a role in his behavior and decision-making process, but not in making him unsteady near a dangerous railing,’ said the report. The distraught man died from blunt force trauma to his torso and lower extremities at a local hospital.Initially blamed on wet conditions after a two hour rain delay and intoxication, Mr Homer’s death was soon ruled a suicide. Cursed: Multiple fans have died from falling at Turner Field, the Braves' home stadium since 1997 . His mother described him as a lifelong Braves fan and said he called to tell her he loved her before leaping to his death. ‘He said ‘I love you mom, and I said ‘I love you too’ and that was it.’","Ronald Lee Homer's death was ruled a suicide last month .

An estimated 10,000 walruses unable to find sea ice over shallow Arctic Ocean water have come ashore on Alaska's northwest coast. Scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Friday photographed walruses packed onto a beach on a barrier island near Point Lay, an Inupiat Eskimo village 300 miles southwest of Barrow and 700 miles northwest of Anchorage. The walruses have been coming to shore since mid-September. The large herd was spotted during NOAA's annual arctic marine mammal aerial survey, an effort conducted with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the agency that conducts offshore lease sales. Refuge: Thousands of walruses pack onto a remote Alaskan island after being unable to locate any Arctic sea ice . An estimated 2,000 to 4,000 walruses were photographed at the site Sept. 12. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency that manages walruses, immediately took steps to prevent a stampede among the animals packed shoulder to shoulder on the rocky coastline. The agency works with villages to keep people and airplanes a safe distance from herds. Young animals are especially vulnerable to stampedes triggered by a polar bear, a human hunter or a low-flying airplane. The carcasses of more than 130 mostly young walruses were counted after a stampede in September 2009 at Alaska's Icy Cape. The gathering of walruses on shore is a phenomenon that has accompanied the loss of summer sea ice as the climate has warmed.

However, in recent years, sea ice has receded north beyond continental shelf waters and into Arctic Ocean water 10,000 feet deep or more where walrus cannot dive to the bottom. Walrus in large numbers were first spotted on the U.S. side of the Chukchi Sea in 2007. They returned in 2009, and in 2011, scientists estimated 30,000 walruses along one kilometer of beach near Point Lay. A close up of a Pacific Walrus male among a colony in Alaska.

'In addition to photographing the walrus haulout area, NOAA scientists documented more bowhead whales, including calves and feeding adults in the Beaufort Sea this summer compared to 2012,"" said Ferguson.

Abandoned at a horse rescue centre three times by different owners, Annie the Welsh Cob wasn’t exactly having much luck. But then she met a princess – and got herself a fairytale ending. The princess in question was Princess Anne, who rehomed the 14-year-old horse after spotting her on an official visit to the World Horse Welfare charity in Somerset. She had been considering buying a horse to hack around her Gloucestershire estate, Gatcombe Park. Annie, 14, had been cared for by the charity for three years before Princess Anne (left) decided to adopt her . Annie is now helping the princess herd sheep and hack around her 200 acres of woodland. It marks a dramatic change in fortunes for 14-year-old Annie who came to the charity three years ago when her owners were no longer able to care for her. 'She's perfect for me,' said Princess Anne, president of Horse World Welfare. 'She's 14 and she's not wanting to be too ambitious and I don't want to be very ambitious either. 'She will be a really useful nanny - I have young stock.' The princess added: 'She fits in really well and as far as I'm concerned I was really glad they didn't find someone else for her. 'She is just the size of horse that I could do with now. Horse Annie with her adopter, Princess Anne (left), and World Horse Welfare groom Sammy Veall (right). 'Living here and going across the farm I . like to get off relatively easily and needed a horse that was . reasonably reliable when it come to rural activities.' Princess Anne first met Annie during a tour of the charity's stables in Kingsdon, Somerset. 'She had a very good reputation and it seemed silly for me to go off and get something else,' she said. 'I hope Annie enjoys it here with me. We will be doing some hacking and she will be helping me herd the sheep and cattle. 'Rehoming from a charity may be the best way of finding a horse because you know so much more about the animal you are getting.' Princess Anne described Annie as the 'perfect' horse to help her around her around Gatcombe Park . The Horse World Welfare is now hoping this high-profile adopter will encourage others to help rehome the 7,000 horses currently being looked after by charities across the UK. It has launched a rehoming campaign and warned that horses are being bred in large numbers in spite of a 'saturated' market, with horses being abandoned or sold for just a few pounds. World Horse Welfare chief executive Roly Owers said: 'Our rescue and rehoming centres are full to bursting - and there are thousands more horses who need our help. 'Once again our president, HRH The Princess Royal, has shown outstanding support by rehoming Annie, especially now that Britain is in the midst of a horse crisis.

The father of a 12-year-old girl killed by a teenage boy has filed a lawsuit against the boy's parents for negligence. Anthony Pasquale filed the lawsuit against the parents of his daughter Autumn's murderer, Justin Robinson, in Gloucester County Superior Court on September 23, according to NJ.com. 'If you're going to raise a murderer, you're going to take responsibility for it,' said Kathleen Bonczyk, Anthony Pasquale's attorney for the civil complaint. Off to jail: Justin Robinson, who pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter in the death of Autumn Pasquale, leaves the courtroom after being sentenced to 17 years in prison . Autumn Pasquale was brutally murdered in October in her hometown of Clayton, New Jersey, . Clues: Justin Robinson 'liked' the Facebook page set up to find Autumn despite knowing she was already dead . Pasquale claims in the lawsuit that . Robinson's parents, Anita Saunders and Alonzo Robinson, should have . known that their son was troubled and should have sought treatment for him. Specifically, the lawsuit claims the parents should have been aware that their son was . 'possibly engaging in the theft of bicycles' and had been negatively . affected by witnessing domestic abuse in their home. Robinson, . 16, was sentenced to 17 years in prison this month after pleading . guilty to aggravated manslaughter and admitted to strangling the Clayton . Middle School student to death in October last year. He apologized to the family and said, 'This was not supposed to happen,' as he called the killing a 'mistake.' The New Jersey teenager had lured Autumn to his home with an offer to trade bicycle parts. Prosecutors faced difficulties during the trial including a lack of . physical evidence to determine whether he or his brother Dante Robinson, then 17, . killed Autumn and they struggled for provide a motive for the killing. Devastated: Autumn's mother and father, Anthony Pasquale and Jennifer Cornwell, said their daughter was treated 'like a piece of trash' Life cut short: Authorities found some of Autumn¿s belongings in the teens' house including the white BMX bike she was last seen riding when she left her West High Street home in the New Jersey town . Death . wish: Autumn Pasquale's mother Jennifer Cornwell and father Anthony . Pasquale say they wish her murderers could be given the death penalty . Grim discovery: Gloucester County prosecutors found the body of Autumn Pasquale in a bin just blocks from her house . The teenager will now spend the next half . of his life in prison for the crime, however he will be eligible for parole after 14½ years. 'I'm sorry. I never meant for this to happen,' he told Judge Walter Marshall. 'This was all a big mistake.' Relatives of the girl did not see it . that way, and some wanted the judge to issue a tougher sentence than the . one agreed to in a plea agreement. More than 8,500 people signed an . online petition at change.org demanding a stiffer term, but Superior . Court Judge Walter Marshall Jr. in Gloucester County accepted a plea . deal agreement and the sentence of 17 years. During Robinson's sentencing, family . and friends of Autumn  — many who were hoping for a harsher sentence — . packed one side of the courtroom. Autumn's parents spoke of their pain since losing their daughter. Addressing the court, Anthony Pasquale said that Robinson's sentence was not nearly . long enough and called him a 'murderer who does not deserve to live.' 'I believe the defendant deserves . more than 17 years,' said Mr  Pasquale, who as a mail carrier had . delivered letters to Robinson's family in Clayton, where the families . of the victim and her killer had deep roots. 'I believe his fate should . be nothing but death.' Emotional: Jennifer Cornwell, mother of slain child Autumn Pasquale, leaves the courtroom table after making a statement about her daughter during the sentencing of Justin Robinson . When he pleaded guilty, Justin . Robinson said he acted alone. During a sentencing proceeding, neither . he, his lawyers, nor prosecutors shed light on a motive for the killing, . or even what happened beyond what was already known: Pasquale went to . his house several blocks from hers after receiving a Facebook offer to . trade bike parts on Oct. 20. When she didn't return home that night, her . family, then the entire community, set off in a frantic search. Two . days later, her body was found in a recycling bin behind the home next . to Robinson's. A break in the case for investigators . came when the boy's mother, Anita Saunders, called police after seeing . something troubling in a Facebook post from one of her sons. Speaking briefly during the . sentencing, Saunders told the judge that media accounts of what happened . were incorrect. 'Nobody knows exactly what happened the day of the . accident,' she said. Robinson's lawyer, Jean Faulkner, . told the judge that the boy had post-traumatic stress disorder from . being physically abused as a young boy and seeing his father strangle . his mother more than once. 'This is a learned behavior,' Faulkner said. Pasquale's family told the judge . about Autumn, whom they described as a loving tomboy who wore . mismatched socks and loved to ride her BMX bike. Upset: Anthony Pasquale, father of slain child Autumn Pasquale spoke in court saying her killer Justin Robinson did not deserve to live . Guilty: Justin (pictured left) will now spend the next half of his life behind bars. He plead guilty in August to choking Autumn last year. His brother Donte Robinson (pictured right) has also been charged with the murder . Innocent: Autumn went round to the brothers house to trade BMX bike parts. Instead, they killed her . They talked about how her . disappearance and death touched the town, located 25 miles southeast of . Philadelphia. Her old soccer team, once known as the Clayton Comets, is . now Autumn's Angels; her jersey number, 14, has been retired from the . Clayton Middle School sports teams; a bike path and a park are now named . for her. And they told the judge how members . of the family, including her siblings and young cousins, are in therapy . and dealing with nightmares about her death. 'When I see the blue recycling bins . out, I cry to think Autumn's innocent life was so easily discarded like a . piece of trash,' said the girl's maternal grandmother, Mary Pasquale, . who had taught Justin Robinson in school. A slide show of pictures of Autumn were projected onto a screen in the courtroom. About a dozen family members recalled her as happy, lively young girl who made others laugh. OCTOBER 20, 2012: Autumn Pasquale, who was a week away from her 13th birthday, was last seen riding her BMX bicycle, leaving her home in Clayton, New Jersey. Authorities – from the Gloucester County police to the FBI – joined the search. Her father, Tony Pasquale, told NBC News at the time that the disappearance was ‘not like her'. OCTOBER 21: Hundreds of people gathered at a local church to hand out flyers and form search parties for the freckled blonde. OCTOBER 22: Hundreds more join search efforts for Autumn, spanning into Delaware and New York. After sunset, worried friends and family held a candlelit vigil to pray for her safe return. Not long after the vigil ended, authorities said that they discovered her 5ft2in body dumped in a recycling container five blocks from her home. OCTOBER 23: A press conference was held in the afternoon to say that two brothers, aged 15 and 17, had been arrested for Autumn’s murder.

A former Idaho aerospace executive accused of slapping a crying toddler on a plane and hurling a racial slur at him will plead guilty, it was revealed today. An email from federal prosecutors did not say what charge Joe Rickey Hundley, 60, will plead guilty to during a hearing today. He faces one count of misdemeanor simple assault. His trial had been set to begin Thursday in federal court in Atlanta. Admission of guilt: Joe Rickey Hundley, 60 (left), is expected to enter a guilty plea in connection to the February incident in which he allegedly assaulted 19-month old Jonah Bennett (right) after he started crying on a flight . Victim: Jonah Bennett's mother says that the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears' as the plane began to land . Hundley, who lived in Idaho at the time, was on a Delta flight from Minneapolis to Atlanta on Feb. 8 and was seated in a window seat next to Jessica Bennett, who was sitting in the aisle seat and had her 19-month-old adopted black son on her lap, according to court filings. At the beginning of the flight, Hundley pressed the call button and asked a flight attendant about the airline's policy regarding 'lap children,' prosecutors said in a filing. The way he asked the question made it clear he was unhappy about the child's presence, prosecutors wrote. As the plane descended into Atlanta, the child started crying. Hundley, who is white, leaned over to Bennett and 'told her to shut that n***** baby up,' according to a sworn statement from an FBI agent who investigated the incident. Bennett asked Hundley what he had said, and he leaned in with his face up next to hers and said it again, prosecutors said in a filing. Hundley then slapped the child in the face, leaving a scratch below his right eye, the FBI agent's statement says. Mr Hundley has since moved to North Carolina after being fired amid widespread outrage. In March, Hundley entered a not guilty plea and was released from jail on $10,000 bond. The 60-year-old now faces a year in prison and a fine of up to $100,000. Hundley's . attorney said earlier this year that her client was on his way to take . his son off life support after being told just 24 hours earlier that he . had overdosed on insulin, and was 'upset and grieving' at the time of . the incident. Speaking out: Jessica Bennett, pictured with her husband, was shocked when she said Joe Rickey Hundley demanded that she 'shut that n****r baby up' Hundley's son was 'in a coma for . life,' attorney Marcia Shein said in a statement. 'On the flight, he was . in distress, upset and grieving,' she said. The boy's mother, Jessica Bennett, of . Minneapolis who is white, was seated with her adopted black son, Jonah, . when she says Hundley struck her child after using a racial slur . directed at them. 'Shut that . n****r baby up,' he allegedly told the mother while their Delta was descending from Minneapolis into Atlanta. Shein . said he did use a racial slur when the child started crying because of . ear pressure, but she denied that Hundley struck the boy. In media interviews, the child's mother has said Hundley was belligerent and seemed intoxicated during the flight. 'I said, ""What did you just say?"" And . he was so drunk that he fell onto my face and his mouth moved over to . my ear and he said it directly into my ear,' She told ABC News. It was then she said that Hundley lifted and . swung his hand at her child.

A witness to a double murder alleged to have been carried out by Aaron Hernandez claims he saw the former NFL star pull the trigger. The 26-year-old man was in a car with Danny Abreu and Safiro Furtado when they were shot dead in an apparently random attack while on their way home from a night out. Yesterday he alleged that it was Hernandez who pulled the trigger, saying he recognised the former New England Patriots player's face in the media when Hernandez was charged with a separate killing. Scroll down for video . Claims: Aaron Hernandez opened fire on two men as they left a nightclub in July last year, a witness says . Witness: This man, who does not want to be identified, blames Hernandez for his friends' murders . The 23-year-old star last month pleaded not guilty to the murder of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player found dead less than a mile from his home in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Hernandez is also being investigated by a grand jury over the deaths of Abreu and Furtado in July 2012, soon after they left a nightclub in Boston. Now a friend of the two victims, who has refused to be named, has told Fox25 that he saw the ex-Patriots player shoot the two men while shouting, 'What up negroes?' He said that the three friends, all immigrants from Cape Verde off the coast of Africa, had been partying at Cure nightclub in Boston's Theater District, and had not been in any fights.

Last month it emerged that Hernandez was caught on surveillance camera at the same club as Abreu and Furtado on the night of their death. Boston police commissioner Ed Davis told Fox25 that the case was still under investigation and expressed optimism that it would reach a conclusion soon. Officials believe that Hernandez may have killed Lloyd to stop him speaking out about last year's murders, according to reports. His Patriots contract was cancelled as soon as he was arrested, and the team offered to swap all replica jerseys bearing his name which were handed in by fans.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:42 EST, 2 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:30 EST, 2 October 2013 . Bestselling author Tom Clancy has died at the age of 66 in his birth town of Baltimore, Maryland. Clancy wrote espionage and military thrillers including 'The Hunt for Red October,' 'Patriot Games,' 'Clear and Present Danger' and 'The Sum of All Fears.' Those four books were all turned into successful blockbuster films starring actors Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, and Ben Affleck. Another film based on his desk-jockey CIA hero, 'Jack Ryan,' is set for release later this year, while his next book, 'Command Authority,' is set to be published on December 3. Tom Clancy died last night at age 66 in Baltimore, Maryland October 2, 2013. He's pictured (left) in 2002 . Clancy and his first wife, Wanda, married in 1969. They divorced 30 years later. He's pictured here in 1997 . The cause of his death is not yet known. The Baltimore Sun reported that Clancy died Tuesday at Johns Hopkins Hospital after a 'brief illness.' The New York Times first reported news of Clancy's death. Seventeen of his novels ranked No. 1 on the New York Times best-sellers list, . including his most recent, 'Threat Vector,' which was released in . December 2012. He first arrived on best-seller lists in 1984 with 'The Hunt for Red October.' He sold the manuscript to the first publisher he tried, the Naval Institute Press, which had never bought original fiction. Clancy had said his dream had been simply to publish a book, hopefully a good one, so that he would be in the Library of Congress catalog. Tom Clancy is pictured at his wedding to freelance journalist Alexandra Marie Llewellyn in New York in 1999 . Tom Clancy poses with a copy of his novel 'The Teeth of the Tiger' during the book's presentation at Barnes and Nobles Books on Fifth Avenue in New York City in 2003 . Born in Baltimore on April 12, 1947 to a mailman and his wife, Clancy entered Loyola College as a physics major, but switched to English as a sophomore, saying later that he wasn't smart enough for the rigors of science. Ironically, his novels carried stiff doses of scientific data and military detail. After graduation in 1969, he married his college sweetheart Wanda and joined her family's insurance business, all the while scribbling down ideas for a novel. They divorced 30 years later. The novelist went on to marry freelance journalist Alexandra Marie Llewellyn. Wanda Clancy told MailOnline in a phone interview that she'd kept a distance from her ex when he passed away saying, 'No, I wasn't there.' In 1979, Clancy began 'Patriot Games,' in which he invented his hero, CIA agent Jack Ryan. In 1982, he put it aside and started 'The Hunt For Red October,' basing it on a real incident in November 1979, in which a Soviet missile frigate called the Storozhevoy attempted to defect. In real life, the ship didn't make it, but in Clancy's book, the defection is a success. This is a screen grab from 'The Sum of All Fears' starring Morgan Freeman (left) pictured as DCI William Cabot, with Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan, in a scene from the film based on the novel, of the same title, by Tom Clancy . By a stroke of luck, President Reagan got 'Red October' as a Christmas gift and quipped at a dinner that he was losing sleep because he couldn't put the book down — a statement Clancy later said helped put him on the New York Times best-seller list. It led to a string of hits, both on the page and in Hollywood blockbusters. He even ventured into video games with the best-selling 'Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier,' ''Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction' and 'Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent.' The latest Jack Ryan movie, directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Chris Pine, is set for release in the U.S. on Christmas Day. Keira Knightly plays Jack Ryan's wife and Kevin Costner plays his mentor at the CIA. Clancy resided in rural Calvert County, Md., and in 1993 he joined a group of investors led by Baltimore attorney Peter Angelos who bought the Baltimore Orioles from businessman Eli Jacobs. Clancy also attempted to bring a NFL team to Baltimore in 1993, but he later dropped out of the effort. Novels by Tom Clancy .

A Michigan oncologist charged with intentionally misdiagnosing patients with cancer as part of a major Medicare fraud operation will remain in prison until trial, with court officials scared he will flee to the Middle East. Dr Farid Fata - who is accused of ordering unnecessary treatments for his patients, such as chemotherapy, to enrich himself through insurance programs - made an application in the federal court to have his bond reduced from $9 million to $500,000 so he could leave prison, where he has been held since August 6. However the move backfired for the 45-year-old, who works out of metropolitan Detroit, with a judge today removing Fata's bond completely, based on the 'serious risk' he would leave America for his native country, Lebanon, if given the chance. Scam: Dr. Farid Fata is accused of administering cancer treatment to people who didn't need it to scam Medicare out of millions of dollars . The prosecution successfully claimed that not all of Fata's considerable assets had been seized since his arrest and that he could fund a trip overseas for himself and his wife. 'We can't be sure how much money he has out there,' prosecutor Catherine Dick said . It is alleged Fata received about $35 million from Medicare via his insurance scam over a two year period. ""Obviously there is a presumption of innocence ... but the court feels there is a serious risk of flight,' U.S. District Judge, Paul Borman, said. 'The charges are serious.' Defense attorney Christopher Andreoff, however, argued Fata should be confined to his home with an electronic monitor. Andreoff said it's also difficult to prepare for trial when Fata is being held at a federal prison in Milan, 50 miles southwest of Detroit. 'I need my client to explain the significance of all the medical records,' Andreoff said. Demonstrators protest at the Detroit federal courthouse today against indicted cancer doctor Farid Fata, who has been jailed since August on multiple counts of Medicare fraud and affecting the lives of many patients and their families . The government alleges that Fata exposed numerous patients to powerful cancer-fighting drugs when they didn't have cancer, which he denies. Outside court today about a dozen people protested his possible release. Signs read,'Without fail Fata will jump bail' and 'No bond for death doctor'. One woman, Michelle Mannarino held a sign with a picture of her late mother, Joan Donohue, 76, and the message, ""I trusted him once with her life."" Mannarino said Fata insisted on months of chemotherapy even after her mother's breast cancer was in remission. Donohue died of kidney failure in 2010. 'I believe we'd still have her today,' Mannarino said. History: Oncology nurse Angela Swantek says she complained to investigators about Fata in 2010 . Angela . Swantek, an oncology nurse who spent time at one of Fata's clinics, . told ABC News that she first complained to investigators about Fata's . alleged wrongdoings as far back as 2010. 'I . don't know how he's gotten away with it for this long,' she told ABC . News. 'I was disgusted. I got in the car, I was still sitting in the . parking lot and I was truly almost in tears just because of what I saw . and how patients were getting their chemotherapy.' Fata's attorney, Christopher Andreoff, says the government is wrong and that his client is not guilty of anything. 'The . government has not retained an expert to give an opinion that there was . a mistreatment, or misdiagnosis, or unnecessary tests given to any . patient,' he said.

A growing number of American Jews consider themselves Jewish by race and culture but less so by religion, according to the wide-spanning survey. One in five - 22 per cent - of Jewish Americans say they . have 'no religion' showing a trend towards secular Jewish identity in . the U.S., the report finds. In the total U.S. adult population, people who describe themselves as Jewish when asked about their religion account for just 2 per cent. Fewer Jewish Americans consider themselves to be religious, but are proud of their cultural roots, a wide-ranging survey has revealed . The survey, by the Washington-based Pew Research Center, found that those with a direct Jewish ancestry who would describe themselves as atheist, agnostic or having . no particular religion, appears to be on the rise. The results show that this trend that appears to be growing among younger American Jews. As much as 93 per cent of older American Jews, those born between 1914 and 1927, said they were Jews by religion. But this proportion steadily declines the younger the age of the respondents. More than one in five American Jews say they have no religion, according to research . Among 'Boomer' Jews, born between 1946 . and 1964, 81 per cent described themselves as Jewish by religion, and . for Millennial Jews, born after 1980, the figure was down to 68 per . cent. 'This shift in Jewish . self-identification reflects broader changes in the U.S. public. Americans as a whole – not just Jews – increasingly eschew any religious . affiliation,' the report, titled 'A Portrait of Jewish Americans,'  states. It underlines that percentage of American Jews who describe themselves as having no religion reflects the national average for adults with no religion. Practising Jewish faith is on the decline among Jewish people, according to the research. Pictured, Central Synagogue in Manhattan, New York City . Jews with no religion, often referred to as cultural or secular Jews, often tend to be less connected to Jewish organisations and are less likely to raise their children as Jewish. Among religious Jews, more than 90 per cent with young children were raising them as Jewish or partially Jewish. Whereas among none-religious Jews, this figure fell to around 33 per cent. Religious Jews are far more likely to marry other Jews, with only 36 per cent having a spouse who was not Jewish. None-religious Jews are far more likely to marry outside of their Jewish culture - 79 per cent. Only 20 per cent of intermarried parents were raising their children Jewish by religion, versus 96 per cent among dual- Jewish parents. The report found that intermarriage rates among American Jews had risen significantly over the last 50 years. Before . 1970, the percentage of Jews with a none-Jewish spouse stood at 17 per . cent.

The survey found a trend toward more younger Jews having no religious identity, than older members of the community . Increasingly, Jewish people are marring non-Jewish people, the survey also found .

Still missing: The 1988 case of missing Pinole, California girl Amber Swartz-Garcia was reopened Tuesday . Police in Northern California reopened on Tuesday the case of a 7-year-old girl who vanished from her family’s front yard 25 years ago. Amber Swartz-Garcia hasn’t been seen by her Pinole, California family since 1988, but officials bowed to pressure from her mother and local community members Tuesday by agreeing to reopen the case in order to use improved forensic technology. This, despite a 2009 confession to the girl’s murder by known area child killer Curtis Dean Anderson. Though her case had been subsequently closed, not everyone believed Anderson. ‘I think he wanted to make a name for himself and get off of death row,’ Amber’s mother Kim Swartz told KTVU. Swartz was joined by 1,300 others who signed a petition to get the case reopened. The announcement was made Tuesday night at a Pinole City Council meeting. ‘The . bottom line is Amber wasn't found and we want to make sure we do . everything we can to locate her,’ Police Chief John Hardester said. Meanwhile, . Hardester was clear that there is no new evidence in the case and that . Anderson, who died just a month after his confession, has not been . cleared in the case. Then and now: Amber was 7-years-old when she disappeared from her family's front yard in June of 1988. She has been missing since. Age progression technology was used to what Amber might look like now, in her early 30s. Murderer? The case was reopened despite a 2007 confession from known child killer Curtis Dean Anderson, who said he drove Amber to Arizona, killed her, and buried her body near a highway . Doubt: Anderson died just a month after he confessed to murdering Amber and police say they were unable to 're-interview' him regarding his crimes . Swartz was still buoyed by the new turn in her young daughter’s tragic case. ‘I'm totally excited,’ Swartz said before a cheering crowd. ‘Like maybe my days of running into brick walls is over with.’ The FBI offered Pinole police the use of their forensic labs in order to expedite the investigation. 'It is hoped that opening the case will encourage information exchange regarding the case,' police said in a statement, 'and to generate information that might lead to the recovery of Amber Swartz.' 'I'm totally excited': Amber's mother Kim Swartz was joined by 1300 people who sign a petition to get her daughter's case reopened . Good and bad: Community members cheered the announcement from Pinole Police Chief John Hardester, who maintained nonetheless that no new evidence has been uncovered to refute Anderson's confession . Anderson . told authorities that he forcibly took Amber from in front of her home . in 1988 and eventually killed and buried her in Arizona. Amber's body has never been located. His death came, according to police, before he could be 're-interviewed' regarding his confession. Amber . is among eight females Anderson was convicted of kidnapping and . murdering, including the most recent victim Xiana Fairchild. Fairchild . disappeared December 9, 1999. Despite . his death and confessions, the FBI is still ‘seeking the public’s . assistance in identifying alleged victims’ of Anderson’s. Serial killer: Curtis Dean Anderson had confessed to at least eight murders when he died in 2007. Police were subsequently unable to interview him further. Now family and supporters of Kim Swartz say they have room to doubt his confession . Curtis Dean Anderson was sitting on death row at California's Corcoran State Prison when he confessed to the murder of 7-year-old Amber Swartz-Garcia. He told police in 2007 that he forcibly took the girl and drove to Arizona, where he said killed and buried her along a highway in the town of Benson. One month after his confession, on December 9, 2007, Anderson died before police were able to 're-interview' him regarding his confession. The Swartz-Garcia case was closed in 2009. Her body has yet to be recovered. Anderson's most recent known murder was of a 7-year-old Vallejo, California girl named Xiana Fairchild in 1999, for which he was sentenced to 300 years in prison. The killer confessed to at least eight murders, though most of his victims--all of them female--remain unidentified. Nearly all were in or near the San Francisco Bay area beginning with the murder of a Marysville woman in her late teens or early 20s in 1984.

Forgetful: Fewer than half of the people in the survey could recall when Princess Diana died, even though it was only in 1997 . The internet could be making us more forgetful, according to a study published yesterday, because it is so easy to 'Google it' The survey of 2,000 adults found fewer than half could name the year that Princess Diana died, even though it only happened in 1997. Less than one third knew the year in which the Berlin Wall fell and just 50 per cent were aware of when man first walked on the moon. Remarkably, four in ten didn’t know the year in which the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center took place. As many as 87 per cent of those who took part said a ‘heavy reliance’ on the internet meant they made less of an effort to remember things 'because we can look them up'. The research, commissioned by Grant’s Whisky, examined the modern Brit’s knowledge of famous historical events and the years in which they took place. The study launches Grant’s ‘Read All About It’ campaign which will offer purchasers of every special bottle, a free newspaper front page reprint from any date in history since 1903. Unsurprisingly, the most common date known was the Battle of Hastings in 1066, while the dates of the two World Wars and England’s World Cup win were also ingrained on the nation’s memory. A spokesman for Grant’s Whisky said: 'Certain dates are impressed upon us a lot at school and tend to stick but clearly the art for remembering dates fades and it seems we are now retaining less. History: Nine in 10 people could remember the Battke of Hastings was, 1066 . 'Particularly in terms of recent events, for example people were four times more likely to know when The Battle of Hastings occurred than they were to know when the invasion of Iraq took place. 'The internet is an incredible resource which enriches and adds much to the quality of modern life, but it could be changing the traditional way we remember and process things - certainly compared to older generations. Terrorist attacks: Only six in ten could remember in what year 9/11 took place, 2001 . 'Perhaps the ability to know the exact dates of things isn’t so crucial, but it’s important the human stories behind those events don’t get lost and we never stop appreciating what’s happened before.' It also emerged a concerned eight in ten people feel younger people today are less bothered with history, while the same number feels today’s youth are raised to be more self-involved and less appreciative of what’s gone before. In fact, 56 per cent thought that with 24/7 news and continuous updates on what’s happening, there is less focus on past events nowadays. Despite this, an overwhelming 88 per cent felt that learning and teaching history was still relevant even in an age where knowledge is just a mouse click away. The Grant’s Whisky spokesman added: 'Key moments in history have made us who we are and offer great learnings. 'There is nothing more powerful than hearing about a key historical event from the horse’s mouth but we are clearly not doing enough of it. 'The retelling of stories is not only a powerful way to educate the younger generation, but also a wonderful way of bringing generations together to spend quality time and nurturing a wonderful bond between them.'

Guilty: Austin Sigg, 18, pleaded guilty to all charges in the murder of 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway last year . A Colorado teen charged with abducting and killing 10-year-old Jessica Ridgeway last year pleaded guilty on Tuesday to all charges including sexual assault on a child, against the advice of his attorneys. Austin Sigg, 18, could be sent to prison for the rest of his life for murdering Jessica in Westminster, Colorado, in October 2012. Jessica was snatched off the street while walking to school, and her disappearance panicked thousands of residents in Denver's western suburbs. In court yesterday, prosecutors for the first time accused him of sexually assaulting the school girl - which he also pleaded guilty to . Sigg also was charged with attempted murder, attempted sexual assault and attempted kidnapping in connection with the botched abduction of a 22-year-old woman near the girl’s home months before the Ridgeway killing. He also pleaded guilty to these charges. Prosecutors said Sigg entered the pleas because of overwhelming evidence against him. His trial would have started Thursday. 'The writing was on the wall,' Jefferson County District Attorney Peter Weir said after the hearing. Sigg faces a minimum sentence of 40 years in prison with the possibility of parole afterward when he is sentenced after a hearing starting November 18. Prosecutors asked Judge Stephen Munsinger to impose consecutive sentences on some of the other charges so Sigg spends the rest of his life behind bars. Sigg's lawyers argue the law doesn't allow that. Tragic: Jessica Ridgeway, 10, was snatched off the street in her quiet suburban neighborhood, bound and then murdered by Austin Sigg last October . Jessica Ridgeway's mother Sarah Ridgeway left the courtroom as prosecutors described the horrors committed against her daughter by Sigg . Sigg cannot face the death penalty because he was 17 at the time of the slaying. 'In this case, there has been justice for Jessica,' Weir said. Defense attorney Mitch Ahnstedt told the court that Sigg was entering the pleas against his lawyers' counsel but he didn't explain why. Sigg's father, Rob Sigg, said in a statement that he was thankful that the Ridgeway family would be spared the ordeal of a trial. 'We ask the community to continue to support the Ridgeway family and keep them in your thoughts and prayers,' he said. The families of both Jessica and Sigg were in the courtroom Tuesday. Sigg spoke only to answer the judge's questions about whether he understood what he was agreeing to. Accepted: Austin Sigg pleaded guilty to all charges, even though his attorneys advised against it . After Sigg pleaded guilty, prosecutor Hal Sargent started to describe how Sigg grabbed Jessica, pulled her into his car and tied up her hands and feet, leading Jessica's mother, Sarah Ridgeway, to leave the courtroom. Munsinger stopped him after defense attorneys objected, saying they weren't disputing the evidence. Jessica, a fifth-grader who loved purple and performing in a peewee cheerleading squad, left home to walk to school in Westminster on October 5, 2012. She never arrived. Hundreds of people helped search for her. Jessica's backpack was found two days later in Superior, a town about six miles from her home. Days after that, human remains later identified as Jessica's were found in a park. Authorities, meanwhile, urged residents to watch for any suspicious changes in neighbors' behavior. Officers guarded crosswalks and photographed cars in the area. Parents escorted their children to and from area schools. Mailboxes and trees were encircled by ribbons in Jessica's favorite color, purple. Jessica's disappearance on her way home from school caused panic among parents across Denver, who feared their children were not safe . On October 19, 2012, a resident contacted authorities to alert them to Sigg because he reportedly had a fascination with death, Westminster police Detective Luis Lopez testified at a preliminary hearing. FBI agents took a DNA sample from Sigg. On October 23, Sigg's mother, Mindy Sigg, called 911, saying her son wanted to confess. Investigators said Sigg told them some of Jessica's remains were hidden in a crawl space in his mother's home, where he lived. They said Sigg described how he abducted Jessica as she walked past his car. He said he bound her arms and her legs, drove around for a little bit, then took her to his house. Horror: Police discovered Jessica's body in a field off of a highway. It had been severely dismembered by Sigg, who admitted he killed her . There, he told investigators, Sigg tried to strangle the girl and then used his hands to kill her. He also allegedly told investigators that he dismembered Jessica in a bathtub. Lopez said Sigg's DNA was found on Jessica's clothing. Sigg dropped out of high school after the 11th grade and later earned a GED. Former classmates say he was intelligent but complained about school and was bullied for having a high voice. When asked about his criminal record on the 911 call, Sigg told the dispatcher: 'The only other thing that I have done was the Ketner Lake incident where the woman got attacked. That was me.' In the attack on the jogger, investigator Michael Lynch testified that Sigg used homemade chloroform to attempt to subdue the woman. She escaped.","Austin Sigg, 18, pleaded guilty to 15 charges related to the kidnapping, murder and dismemberment of Jessica Ridgeway .

A Turkish waiter has been found guilty of murdering two Irish women on holiday two years ago, it was reported today. Recep Cetin was convicted of stabbing Marion Graham, 54, and her 53-year-old friend Cathy Dinsmore in August 2011. The women were found buried in shallow graves in woods 75 miles outside the popular holiday resort of Kusadasi with multiple knife wounds. Cetin's father Eyup, a taxi driver, was acquitted of the double murder. Recep Cetin, a former boyfriend of Ms Graham's teenage daughter Shannon has been sentenced to life imprisonment, according to the BBC. He had admitted admitted stabbing the victims but denied murder. Ms Graham, from Newry and Ms Dinsmore, from Warrenpoint in Co Down, were close friends and had been on an extended holiday in Turkey when they were killed. It is claimed they were murdered after Ms Graham refused to allow Recep Cetin - known to the family as Alex - marry her teenage daughter. Relatives of both women including Shannon, who was aged 15 when her mother was killed, flew out to Turkey for the court hearing which had been adjourned from last month. A verdict and sentence was previously delayed because two of the judges on the panel were temporary and could not make a ruling on the case.

He said the device was later 'rendered safe.' One package was found in a garage, another in a terminal, although Hartley wouldn't say which of the packages was destructive. Scroll down for video . At least two people were arrested on Tuesday evening at Jacksonville International Airport after authorities found two suspicious packages . A witness had reported seeing at least . two men handcuffed in separate spots - one in the airport and one . outside - shortly before 6 p.m. A second witness told the Florida Times-Union that he saw police throw a man to the ground outside the airport and then put him in handcuffs. No details have been released about the men witnesses said were arrested. A Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office bomb squad team had been called to the scene and the evacuation left planeloads of passengers stuck on the tarmac. Authorities tweeted news of the evacuation on the airport's official Twitter site, but only said that the airport had been evacuated ‘due to police activity regarding suspicious’ packages. The airport re-opened late on Tuesday night after one of the two devices found was taken off-site due to a 'destructive' component . There were no reports of injuries or damage. Jacksonville police had blocked off the entrance to the airport. Airport officials also tweeted that passengers on inbound flights currently on the ground would be bused to offsite hotels as transportation became available. Stewart advised people intending to fly from the airport or pick up travelers to check with their individual airlines on the status of the flights. The incident began when authorities confronted a suspicious man who claimed he had a bomb, while a second man was seen running from the area. One witness, Paul Harral, told the Florida Times-Union, that he and his wife were in a security line when he saw a man talking to a Transportation Security Administration Officer nearby. Police had blocked the road to Jacksonville International Airport after authorities found two suspicious packages and the terminal was evacuated . He said the officer called for an airport police officer and they took the man into the security area beyond the x-ray machine. Harral said he next saw the man he was in handcuffs and TSA officers started to tell those in line to leave the airport.

A transgender woman unhappy with her masculine features has revealed that she sold her house in order to finance a £15,000 surgical makeover. Jenny Bowman, 56, had been left frustrated by the size of her nose and . masculine jawline before discovering a procedure called facial feminisation surgery after an online search. The operation, which softens and feminises the features, isn't available on the NHS but fed up with her masculine looks, she took the dramatic step of putting her house on the market to pay for it. Change for the better: Jenny as she looks now (left) and as she looked when living as a man named Paul (right) Happier: Jenny says she would do the same thing all over again if needed and feels far more confident now . Bruising: Jenny pictured immediately after the operation in 2009 . After selling her three bedroom, semi-detached . Cambridge home, Jenny underwent extensive surgery to reshape her nose, forehead and jawline. Jenny, who was born a boy named Paul, had always felt herself to be a woman trapped in a man's body and began secretly wearing female clothes as a young adult before deciding to live as a woman full-time in her late thirties but lacked confidence because of her looks. 'Since having facial feminisation surgery, I’ve never looked back,' she said. 'It’s been worth every penny as I’m just so much more confident now. 'It meant so much to me that I sold my house to have the operation and I’d do the same again. I think many others in my position would go to the same lengths. 'Some of the changes have been small, but they’ve made such a difference to me. I feel so much better when I look in the mirror.' Miss Bowman was in theatre for six hours as surgeons reconstructed her nose, forehead and jawline, during the 2009 operation at Highgate Private Hospital in London. She was so pleased with the outcome that she became a full-time ambassador for Facial Team, a group of surgeons who perform the surgery across the globe. She now provides support to scores of surgery candidates worldwide and has even observed operations firsthand. 'It’s made such a difference to me,' she added. 'Before, I never wanted anyone to see me in profile, as I thought I looked too masculine, whereas now I feel much more comfortable. 'However, . I think it’s important that transgender people are realistic about the . results - the surgeons don’t have a magic wand and sometimes the changes . can be very subtle. 'But . I’ve worked with some younger people to whom it’s made an absolutely . massive difference - it’s better to get facial feminisation surgery at a . young age, if possible. Much improved: Jenny (left) says she always felt like a woman trapped in a man's body, even when married . Future: Jenny says she hopes that facial feminisation surgery will one day be available on the NHS . 'We call these women ""invisible"" transgenders, because it’s virtually impossible to tell they were born in male bodies.' A former car salesperson, Miss Bowman first suspected that she was a woman trapped in a male body when she was just seven. She struggled with her identity for almost 30 years, joining a rugby team as a young man in a bid to fit in with her male peers. She was in a marriage for several . years, which led to the birth of a daughter, but the relationship broke . down as she attempted to come to terms with her situation. 'From an early age, I knew that I wanted to be a girl but, back then, these things weren’t talked about. 'I . felt lucky to have met a lovely woman and I genuinely do think I was in . love with my wife, but the desire to be the woman you feel like inside . never goes away. 'After my marriage broke down, I realised I couldn’t go on as I was. When . I decided to go out dressed as a woman for the first time, I was . terrified. I was trembling so much I didn’t think I’d make it past the . front door. 'But in the end it was a really liberating experience. Becoming Jenny felt like being reborn.' Miss Bowman, who is single, moved to a rented cottage in Newmarket, Suffolk, after selling her property in June 2009 to pay for her operation. Despite her extensive surgery, she has no plans to have a full sex change. She believes facial feminisation surgery should one day be available on the NHS, as is currently the case with conventional gender reassignment surgery. 'Looking to the long term, it would be great if facial feminisation surgery was eventually available on the NHS,' she explained. 'It would be very costly, in terms of carrying out the operations and putting doctors through the relevant qualifications. 'But this isn’t just an aesthetic thing - many women like me feel that they need this surgery in order to achieve integration.'","Jenny Bowman, 56, sold her Cambridgeshire home to pay for the op .

Swiss scientists will launch a ‘janitor’ satellite with flexible tentacles that could sweep up space junk within five years. CleanSpace One will be sent to remove thousands of bits of jettisoned rocket and satellite components orbiting our planet at speeds of more than 28,000 km/h. The satellite will get hold of orbiting debris and throw it back into Earth's atmosphere, where they will burn up on re-entry. Scroll down for video... The CleanSpace One satellite's mission will be to clean up the thousands of bits of jettisoned rocket and satellite components orbiting Earth at speeds of more than 28,000 km/h . The debris orbiting Earth has become an increasingly serious problem. Last year, a Nasa report said that the amount of space junk orbiting earth had reached a 'tipping point'. In practical terms, this means that the amount of junk floating around the planet will make it difficult for spacecraft to leave the planet. 'We've lost control of the environment,' said retired Nasa senior scientist Donald Kessler, who authored the report. Last year, Ecole polytechnique federale de Lausanne (EPFL) announced its intention to design and launch CleanSpace One. There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites . Since the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris. The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel. There are around 22,000 objects in . orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and . countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying . spaceships and valuable satellites. It . is estimated that there are as many as 370,000 pieces of space junk . floating in Earth's orbit, traveling at speeds of up to 22,000 mph. The picture above shows a ball of twisted metal, thought to be fallen space junk, on a farm in Queensland, Australia, in 2008. The group have now come a step closer to their goal by entering into a partnership with Swiss Space Systems (S3). S3 is developing a new method to launch satellites weighing up to 250 kg, and will take charge of CleanSpace One's launch, now scheduled for 2018. The company said it will invest £10million in the project and will launch the satellite into orbit.

Getting to and seizing the ex -satellite is a formidable feat of engineering. A three-phase launch Swiss Space Systems - S3 is now the Prime partner in this project. The company, headquartered in Payerne, Switzerland, is developing a new launch method for small satellites up to hundreds of kilograms in weight. It plans to send a small shuttle rides on top of an Airbus A300 jetliner. VIDEO: CleanSpace One, a Swiss solution to space junk . CleanSpace One's mission is to grab hold of a piece of space junk - in this case an out-of-commission Swiss nanosatellite measuring 10cm on each side - and thrust it into the atmosphere, where it will burn up . When the plane reaches cruising altitude, this Suborbital Reusable Shuttle (SOAR) will start its engines and take off upwards. When it reaches an altitude of 80km, it will eject a vessel, which after reaching an altitude of 700 km, will releases the satellite into Earth’s orbit. According to the company, the three-phase process will cut launch costs by a factor of four. And to make sure that this doesn’t end up putting even more space debris in Earth orbit, S3 will ensure that all the elements in the chain include their own re-entry systems. The company plans to launch CleanSpace One in 2018 and said the satellite design is on the right track. The design is slighter larger than originally planned, and will weigh about 30 kg. ‘You can’t democratise space access without having a responsible attitude,’ said Pascal Jaussi, chief executive of Swiss Space Systems. ‘If we don’t deal with the problem of orbiting space debris and its accumulation, future generations’ access to space will be compromised.

It sounds like a boss' dream: pen toppers that double up as cutlery meaning a worker never has to leave their desk at lunchtime again. The Dine Ink Pen Utensil Set is made of plastic and includes a fork, spoon and knife topper. They can each be slotted onto the end of any standard ballpoint pen, meaning the pen can be used in the traditional way before being flipped over and becoming a utensil.

With a fitness regime that involves spending three hours a day in the gym and a carefully controlled diet Charlotte Anderson, 26, has certainly earned her place in the final of the British Bodybuilding Championships. The Somerset athlete has been dubbed 'Britain's hottest firefighter' and has impressed colleagues with her dedication as well as judges in the 'body fitness' category. And Charlotte has repaid the compliment to her colleagues, saying her gruelling training with Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service has helped hone her incredible physique. Muscular: Charlotte will be taking part in the body fitness category at the British Bodybuilding Championships . Gruelling: Charlotte puts her physique down to her challenging job combined with three hour workouts . 'I am not scared of weights or sweating,' said Charlotte, who hails from Shepton Mallet in leafy Somerset. 'There is plenty of time to look girly when I get dressed up and go out, but when I'm at the gym it's the same as being at the fire ground, it's both sweat and stamina.' Charlotte is a retained firefighter at Shepton Mallet fire station. Single Charlotte started lifting weights when she joined the retained fire service three years ago. 'I wanted to keep up with the boys on the fire rounds,' she said. 'It's . not that I don't like asking for help - especially in a crucial . situation - but I didn't want to be a girly-girl out on the fire calls.' Charlotte, who also has a full-time office job, added: 'I get a lot of banter at the station about my competing. 'I . took my trophy in and I think they are really pleased for me but they . do make jokes about it - I think that just shows that they do support me . though. Natural: Body fitness requires muscles that aren't too pumped up plus beauty pageant style presentation . Impressive: Charlotte juggles her workouts with her role as a retained fireman and a job at the local council . 'They call me ""Guns"" quite a lot and if something is really heavy they say ""don't worry we can get Guns on it"". 'But they are really supportive and put up with my mood swings which I get sometimes on the low carb parts of my diet. 'Being in the retained fire service is a really mix when it comes to helping my training. 'Sometimes . we will be out on lots of jobs, which is great for fitness, but does . make me tired when it comes to trying to fit in my personal fitness.' She won second place in the bodyfitness category at the South West Classic Bodybuilding and Open Championships last month and will now compete in the final. 'It's called body fitness and the goal is for a more natural look to the muscles than bodybuilding,' she of the competition. 'Girls are expected to have pageant appearances, so they are marked on looks and hair as well as muscle tone and size. 'I have been on a pre-competition diet for the last four months which means eating every three hours with a strict exercise regime of at least three hours a day. 'Typically I work two muscle groups at a time in a four day spilt. I train by myself which is hard but push bigger weights every time. 'I am hoping to work up to the next class of physique but lean muscle will take years to obtain naturally but is worth the patience and dedication.' The final of the British Bodybuilding Championships takes place later this month in Harrogate.","Charlotte Anderson to compete in the finals of top bodybuilding competion .

Mohammed Hussein, 19, part of a notorious North London gang, was killed by rival gang members with a sawn-off shotgun, the jury was told. The alleged murder, which took place around a tower block, was caught on CCTV cameras. Mohammed Hussein, 19, was killed in a 'Western'-style shoot-out, Kingston Crown Court heard . The jury was told that Mr Hussein, a member of the Get Money Gang (GMG), was shot by rivals from Dem Africans (DA) on April 1. Natneal Tesfay, 21, is on trial for firing two shots at Mr Hussein two years after a member of the DA gang, Negus McLean, 15, was stabbed to death of a street less than half a mile away. Around the time of the shooting, four members of Mr Hussein's gang were due to stand trial for this murder, the jury heard. According to The Independent, Simon Denison, QC, for the prosecution, said: 'This case is a terrifying example of how cheap life is among teenage gang members in London. He added: 'What happened was like something out of the old western movies, except it was not American fiction, it was reality, in a public car park in north London. 'And it was captured by a CCTV camera that overlooked the car park.' Police near the scene of Mr Hussein's death in Edmonton, North London . The court was told that three men, including Tesfay, were seen walking out of Walbrook House, in Edmonton, to intercept Mr Hussein after he had arrived in a black BMW minutes earlier. Mr Hussein was said to have been with two friends.. In the silent CCTV footage, Tesfay is allegedly seen pulling a sawn-off shotgun out a carrier bag before firing two shots at Mr Hussein. The jury heard the second shot hit him in the chest and he was left dying in an alleyway. An unidentified friend of Mr Hussein then pointed his own gun at the rival gang, the court heard. The CCTV showed he was then chased by two defendants back to the BMW when he was driven away. The car then drove back around to Mr Hussein's body but drove off as passers-by attempted to save Mr Hussein's life. Mr Tesfay, 21, alleged to have fired the gun, Christopher Aluma, 19, a 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and Simeon Birde, 19, all deny murder. The court was told that Mr Tesfay is likely to claim that he shot at Mr Hussein out of self-defence. The two gangs are based in neighbouring areas in Enfield and Edmonton, in North London.

If so, you're likely to be a man in demand after new research revealed that having a shortened name increases your appeal among the opposite sex. Women who call themselves Jen, Val, Debs and Jo are also set to benefit as the effect is the same regardless of sex. Overall, the new study found that shorter names had greater appeal than longer ones in a huge 72 per cent of cases. Romantic success: Having a shortened name can increase your appeal to the opposite sex, a survey has found . Women did have a slight advantage though: while 79 per cent of men found shortened names appealing, the same was true for just 69 per cent of female respondents. The study was conducted by online dating site Badoo, which studied the approaches made by its 190 million users and compared the number of emails sent to those who used shortened versions of their names to those who used their full names. 'Attractiveness online is not only about looks,' says a spokesperson for Badoo. 'Even the length of your name, it seems, may also make a surprising difference.' 'Your name says a huge amount about you,' says Jo Hemmings, a behavioural psychologist and dating coach. 'People with abbreviated names appear more approachable and friendlier; less intimidating. A diminutive name gives a sense of warmth and informality.” In the UK, men with who used diminutives such as Mike, . Matt, Phil or Chris attracted more female approaches per head than those . named Michael, Matthew, Philip or Christopher respectively. Would Maximillian and Katherine be as popular? Max and Kate have worked well for Mr Irons and Ms Winslet . Likewise, women called Sue, Mandy or Sam attracted more male advances than those named Susan, Amanda or Samantha. The . general preference for short names, particularly for men, can also be . seen in romantic novels whose square-jawed heroes typically have brief . and often one-syllable names. In fact, the . length of your name affects not only your allure but also your income as . another recent study found. Studies . of marriage records also show that your choice of husband or wife is . influenced by the sound of their name. 'People are slightly more . likely to marry people whose names sound like their own, even if the . similarity is just sharing a first initial,' writes psychologist . Jonathan Haidt in his book The Happiness Hypothesis. So, . men named Dennis are more likely than others to marry women named . Denise, while women named Louise are often drawn to men named Louis . or even Laurence. Not only does your name reveal how popular you are with the opposite sex and how well you are paid, it can also give clues to how you're perceived by your friends. A new study has found that men called Dave are seen to be the most loyal by friends and the same is true for women named Claire and Emma. For advice, men are most likely to turn to friends named John but when life gets tough, it's friends named Steve, Dan or Peter that they most want to see. Women, meanwhile, are likely to have known a friend called Sarah for the longest amount of time but will turn to friends named Becky, Joanne or Nicola when they need help. The research, which was conducted by Jagermeister, also found that a fifth of British people see their best friends at least once a week, with one in three saying their best friends are more important to them than family members. Dr Rebecca Spelman, a psychologist at the Private Therapy Clinic comments: 'The way in which names can influence someone’s personality is a self-fulfilling prophecy and without recognising it, we build a mental image and certain expectations of what a person is like based on their name. 'Meeting another 'Dave' will lead to a subconscious consideration about the original acquaintance, that in turn, helps hone the belief that he, too possesses similar qualities. 'Interestingly many parents name their children after a person they particularly like.  Some names happen to be more successful than others and some sound more attractive. 'So it seems that the names that have the best influence on people’s lives keep getting reused again and again.'","People preferred those who used diminutives 72% of the time .

Rev Howard Curtis was arrested on suspicion of assaulting three people at Coulsdon Christian Fellowship . A church minister has been arrested over claims he spanked worshippers. Rev Howard Curtis, 70, allegedly persuaded worshippers to undress for him in the office of Coulsdon Christian Fellowship, in Croydon, south London. The claims are believed to centre around a movement known as Christian Domestic Discipline, which involves men asserting authority over women through physical punishment, usually spanking. Mr Curtis has been banned from unsupervised contact with children and forbidden from attending his own church alone while the Metropolitan Police probes allegations about his conduct. Three people have lodged assault allegations against Mr Curtis, senior minister, who is believed to have been involved with the church for at least two decades. They include claims he asked women to strip in his office before spanking them. The assaults are alleged to have happened between 2006 and 2009. He was arrested in July and has been bailed until October 22 while police continue their investigation. Mr Curtis denied the allegations, which he described as 'malicious'. Speaking outside his home in Croydon, on Monday, he said: 'I have not done anything wrong, but it seems you are guilty as soon as you are accused. The police seem to think so, arresting me. 'I believe these allegations were maliciously made. I don't even know exactly what I have been accused of. I am having to wait while the police investigate.' Mr Curtis said he had 'heard of' Christian Domestic Discipline, but refused to be drawn on whether he practised it. The senior minister of Coulsdon Christian Fellowship (pictured) allegedly persuaded worshippers to undress for him in his office before being spanked . Worshippers at Coulsdon Christian Fellowship, which describes itself as an 'independent charismatic Baptist church' in Chipstead Valley Road, also declined to discuss the practice on Monday. They said Mr Curtis was no longer involved with the church but would not comment further. Rev Dominic Warner, a minister at the church, did not respond to requests for a comment. Mr Curtis is also chairman of Coulsdon Chess Fellowship and listed as a trustee of the 1st Coulsdon Scout Group, both of which meet at the church. The website of Christian Domestic Discipline says the practice is 'intended to be a haven for married couples who practise safe and consensual' discipline. It espouses that women are the 'heart' of the home, while men are the 'head'. The website states that 'most CDD marriages use spanking', for offences including disobedience, disrespect, dishonesty or dangerous choices.

Whimsical character: Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, pictured during a military parade in Brazil in 2005, has withdrawn his country from the Commonwealth . Mr Jammeh, who claims to have developed a cure for Aids, has been criticised in the past by Britain for human rights abuses, including when he executed nine death-row inmates by firing squad in August of last year. Rights groups such as Amnesty International have also criticised the Gambian government for cracking down on dissent and targeting political opponents and sexual minorities for arrest and detention, among other alleged abuses. The move to leave the association, largely made up of former British colonies, was announced in a statement yesterday, just six weeks before the club's biennial summit. The gathering, to be held in Sri Lanka on November 16, will be opened by the Prince of Wales. He will be joined by David Cameron and about 50 other heads of state. The Foreign Office told MailOnline: 'Decisions on Commonwealth membership are a matter for each member government. 'We would very much regret Gambia, or any other country, deciding to leave the Commonwealth.' It is not thought the decision would affect Britons travelling to the country, which has become a popular tourist destination for UK nationals. Bakary Dabo, former vice president of Gambia and chairman of the country's campaign for democratic change, said the Gambian people are generally 'very happy' to be part of the Commonwealth. Despot: Mr Jammeh addresses the United Nations General Assembly last month when he declared that homosexuals were 'very evil' and threatened to behead them if they didn't leave The Gambia . Poverty: Mr Jammeh has been criticised by Britain and campaign groups for human rights abuses . Sun-seeker's delight: It is not thought the decision would affect Britons travelling to the country, which has become a popular tourist destination for UK nationals . He said Gambian authorities had . recently been seeking attention and 'picking up war against poorly . specified enemies called 'western powers'. He . told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'This has been building up over the . past few years and accelerated, especially as the last week he (Mr . Jammeh) was at the UN General Assembly and used his time located to him . to go into some long rambling about the ""western powers"" and their supposed hegemonic plans around the world.' Mr Jammeh's reign since he seized power in a coup 19 years ago has been dogged by controversy and sheer eccentricity. Just last month in a speech at the UN, he claimed homosexuals were 'very evil' and declared that any who did not leave The Gambia would be beheaded. Blow: The move to leave the association of 54 countries  comes just six weeks before the club's biennial summit, to be opened by Prince Charles and attended by David Cameron as well as 50 other heads of state . Last year, he chose to mark the Muslim . festival of Eid, a time traditionally honoured with gestures of . clemency, by ordering the execution of 38 prisoners. He later reversed . his decision. Weeks later, . he then announced capital punishment would be carried out 'to the . letter' because 'there is no way my government will allow 99 per cent of . the population to be held to ransom by criminals'. Eight men and one woman held in prison near Gambia's capital, Banjul, were executed by firing squad four days later. In 2009, Jammeh's administration rounded up nearly 1,000 people last year in a 'witch hunt' that spanned the nation of two million after he declared someone had killed his aunt by casting a spell on her. Authorities forced the supposed witches to drink a hallucinogen that caused diarrhoea and vomiting. The unidentified liquid led to serious kidney problems and two people died after the forced treatment, according to the international human rights group Amnesty International. And in 2007, the ruler claimed to have developed his own cure for Aids and insisted that patients stop taking their anti-retroviral medications so his herbal rub and banana cure could take effect. It is not known what happened to them. Mr Jammeh seized power from Sir Dawda Jawara in a military coup in 1994 when he was a lieutenant.","Mr Jammeh, who claims to have cured Aids, made decision 'on a whim'

Fake bomb detectors are still being used in Iraq, months after a British conman was jailed for selling them. James McCormick was told by Judge Richard Hone that he had blood on his hands and caused the deaths of innocent victims in war zones as he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in May. The British former policeman is thought to have made £50million from selling three models of 'bomb detectors' based on a novelty £13 golf ball finder to Iraq and other countries. Fake bomb detectors sold for millions by British conman James McCormick are still being used in Iraq . However, these fake detectors are still being used at checkpoints in Iraq as recently as two days ago, according to reports. This week a wave of car bombs struck Baghdad, killing 55 people. The Independent said more than 4,500 . people had been killed in Iraq since McCormick's conviction in April, . despite the Iraqi government promising that the devices would be phased . out. It was intended that sniffer dogs would be used as a replacement, but only two provinces in the south of Iraq have so far installed canine units, according to the newspaper. Iraqi officials are reported to have complained that contradictory statements have been made to them from the government, leading to delays in the fake devices being banned. The 'bomb detectors' were sold for up to £27,000 each but were based on a novelty golf finder . A schoolteacher who witnessed one of . Monday's explosions said: 'I went through one checkpoint on the way in . (to Sadr City) where they had the detectors just before the bombing. 'They look like wands and they are supposed to bend when they spot a bomb. But they are useless, everyone knows that.' Hassan Abu Ridha, whose neighbour was injured in another of the blasts, told the newspaper: 'My cousin is a policeman and he says they know these things do not work, but they have no orders to stop using them and they have been given nothing else. 'The British should have stopped them being sold in the first place, but now it is fault of our government that people are dying.' Despite McCormick's conviction, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki still insisted in May that some of the fake bomb detectors worked. Volatile: People gather at the site of a car bomb attack in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk today . Flames rise from the site of a car bomb attack in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk. Witnesses to the wave of explosions said they saw the fake detectors being used . Attack: Three people were killed and 12 others were wounded in a car bomb attack near the building of the of Kirkuk province, police said . He told AFP: 'The best device in the world does not detect (explosives) more than 60 per cent (of the time)… and results we obtained indicate that these devices detect from 20 to 50 per cent … Some of the devices were real and were detecting [explosives].' McCormick, from Somerset, is believed to have sold 6,000 of the detectors to Iraq and 1,000 other police and military forces including United Nations peacekeepers in Lebanon. The prosecution in his case said there was no scientific basis to the detectors and that they were nothing more than a con. The trial heard some of the detectors were sold for £27,000 each and claims were made that they could find explosives, drugs, fluids, ivory and people. They claimed items could be detected up to 0.6 miles underground, up to three miles from the air and 100ft underwater.","Iraqi police reportedly using fake detectors as recently as two days ago .

Two Muslim Tesco workers have won a discrimination case against the supermarket after bosses kept their prayer room locked. Abdirisak Aden and Mahamed Hasan, both aged 27, were among a number of devout Muslim employees who had lobbied for a prayer room since 2006. In 2008 managers agreed to set aside a security office at the distribution depot in Crick, Northamptonshire, as a prayer room for Muslims. Abdirisak Aden and Mahamed Hasan were among a number of Muslim employees who had lobbied for a prayer room at the distribution depot in Crick, Northamptonshire (pictured) But in 2012 bosses set new restrictions on the use of the room which included keeping it locked when it was not in use. Muslim workers were forced to tell managers when they were going to pray and had to ask for the key and fill in their names in a book every time the entered the room. They also claimed they were forbidden to worship in groups and were only allowed to pray one at a time. Mr Aden and Mr Hasan took the supermarket giant to a tribunal claiming discrimination on the grounds of their religion. Bedford Employment Tribunal found Tesco was guilty of indirect discrimination and awarded the men an undisclosed sum for ‘injury to their feelings’. Christopher Fray, equality officer for the Northamptonshire Rights and Equality Council (NREC), which represented the men at the hearing which ended on September 3, heralded the ruling. Tesco has been found guilty of indirect discrimination by Bedford Employment Tribunal, which awarded the men an undisclosed sum (file picture) He said: 'A large number of Muslims complained that the nature of these prayer guidelines were being used as a way of controlling and monitoring and harassing them. 'The Bedford Employment Tribunal upheld their claims and found they were discriminated against on the grounds of their religion. 'This case is a victory not only for Muslims, but for all people who wish to pray while at work. 'It is one of the first religious discrimination cases that Muslim complainants have won in Britain.' The tribunal heard both men had made it clear to their bosses that they needed to pray at set times in a clean environment. They claimed that Tesco managers were aware of the difficulties Muslim employees faced while trying to pray with no place allocated for them to do this. A Tesco spokesman said: 'We take our responsibilities as an equal opportunities employer very seriously. 'We are considering the implications of the judge’s ruling and await the full written judgment.'","Workers had lobbied for a prayer room at distribution depot since 2006 .

Italy's fragile coalition government has been pushed into a full-fledged crisis after ministers from former premier Silvio Berlusconi's political party announced their resignations. The resignation of the five ministers, which were announced but not yet formally tendered, drew the ire of Premier Enrico Letta, who accused Berlusconi of a 'crazy' gesture aimed at covering up his personal affairs. The five-month-old government has teetered for weeks since the high court confirmed Berlusconi's tax fraud conviction. Former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconici urged ministers in his party to step down if the government does not revoke an increase to Italy's value-added tax - drawing condemnation from current Premier Enrico Letta . Berlusconi's centre-right People of Liberty Party is in an unusual coalition of rival forces with Mr Letta's centre-left Democratic Party, and the resignations signals the end of the alliance. The resignations must be formally submitted to President Giorgio Napolitano, who must decide if there is any way to continue the government or if new elections must be held. The announcement by the centre-right ministers came after Berlusconi urged ministers in his party to step down if the government does not revoke an increase to Italy's value-added tax that takes effect next week. Italy's Prime Minister Enrico Letta said Berlusconi was using the sales tax increase as an alibi 'to justify the crazy and irresponsible gesture, all aimed only to cover up his personal affairs' Tensions already were swirling around a .

Mr Letta said it was Berlusconi who was forcing the government's hand on the sales tax by depriving it of the stability needed to push through alternative measures. 'The Italian people will know to return to the sender such a big lie and attempt to distort reality,' Mr Letta said. Democratic Party leader Giuglielmo Epifani called the centre-right ministers' move 'irresponsible'. 'They are provoking a crisis and we must evaluate exactly what the consequences are,' he said. Mr Letta had warned that he will quit unless he receives prompt pledges of solid support in a confidence vote in Parliament on his government, which is struggling to pull Italy out of a recession. Nearly all of Berlusconi's senators have vowed to quit, if a Senate committee votes next week to strip him of his Senate seat because of the conviction.","Berlusconi urged ministers in his party to step down if the government does not revoke an increase to Italy's value-added tax .

Ross Reisner was a well-known equestrian in the North East, who had been competing since he was a teenager. He had recently opened a horse farm in Mattituck with childhood friend Bobby Ginsberg, and the two had been enjoying a successful start to their venture.

It may be just 10in high  and look like a children’s toy, but this 3D home printer could revolutionise the way we live. Technophiles say The Cube, which goes on sale in Britain today, may pave the way for a world in which consumers manufacture many of the things they want instead of buying them. The £1,195 desktop printer can make plastic items up to 5.5in square such as toys, doorknobs, party cutlery, kitchen utensils or chess pieces. Scroll down for video . The printer could even make a replacement windscreen washer nozzle for your car. When a design for an object is programmed into it from a memory stick or a wifi link to the internet, The Cube recreates it by building up fine layers of hot melted PLA plastic, which is flexible, or ABS, which is rigid. The plastics are recyclable and compostable and the cartridges come in 16 colours, some of which glow in the dark.

Technophiles say the £1,195 desktop printer may pave the way for a world in which consumers manufacture many of the things they want instead of buying them. But this technology doesn’t come cheap, with each cartridge costing £52.80. They contain 320g of plastic, which is enough to make 53 mobile phone cases. The Cube comes with 25 free designs, including chess pieces, napkin holders, jewellery and toys such as cups for a tea party set and a rocket ship. When a design for an object is programmed into it from a memory stick or a wifi link to the internet, The Cube recreates it by building up fine layers of hot melted PLA plastic, which is flexible, or ABS, which is rigid . In future, users will be able to purchase others on the web from specialist design companies at the touch of a button. Users can also create their own designs to be turned into a 3D product. But the process can be time-consuming, taking more than an hour to make a single chess piece. The Cube, which is 10in high, 10in wide and 13in deep, is made by a firm called Cubify. It goes on sale at Currys and PC World, which claim it is so simple that even children can use it. Although 3D printing is still in its infancy and current uses are limited, technology websites are already excited about the possibilities. Reviewers at the popular Pocket-lint site described The Cube as ‘incredible stuff’, concluding: ‘It’s the future right here.’ But experts claim families will need to wait for several generations of the home 3D printer before they can buy one that is genuinely useful. There are also concerns about the technology being used for crime or terrorism after American law student Cody Wilson made and successfully fired a plastic gun from parts created on a 3D printer in May this year. The blueprints were posted online by the self-described anarchist and downloaded 100,000 times before the US government ordered them to be removed.

A former state trooper has returned to court today to plead not guilty for the third time in the murders of his wife and two young children. David Camm, an ex-law enforcement officer from Indiana, is charged with shooting dead his wife, seven-year-old son and daughter, five, in 2000 in a car at their Georgetown home. The 49-year-old has always insisted that he is innocent of the brutal slayings. He was found guilty in 2002 and 2006 but both convictions were overturned on appeal. Scroll down for video . Third round: David Camm, pictured in August, appeared in court today for the beginning of his third trial over the murders of his wife and children in 2000 . The convictions were overturned after it was decided that the court had allowed inadmissible evidence regarding the former officer's alleged affairs and accusations he abused his daughter. In 2005, DNA on a sweatshirt from the scene was tied to Charles Boney who had done time for burglary. He was convicted on three counts of murder and sentenced to 225 years. The former state trooper has spent a majority of the past 13 years behind bars. The Camm slayings are one of Indiana’s . longest-running murder cases, following a tangled legal path riddled . with missing murder weapons, allegations of affairs and child abuse, the . emergence of a second suspect and a prosecutor’s removal over a book . deal. Jury selection began in August with . prosecution and defense weeding out people with prejudice over either . Camm's guilt or innocence. The trial was moved to Boone County in . hopes that an impartial jury could be found. The slayings occurred more . than 100 miles away at the family's Georgetown home. Camm insists he was wrongly convicted, and this trial is another chance to clear his name. For Frank and Janice Renn, Kimberly Camm's parents, this is another shot at closure. 'It’s like that movie Groundhog Day, where he keeps waking up to the same thing every day,’ Mr Renn said. Bloody tragedy: Kimberly Camm, 35 (right), her son, Bradley, age 7 (left), and daughter Jill (center), age 5, were discovered shot dead in the garage of their home in September 2000 . For years, a debate has raged over . whether Camm is a villain or a victim, with both sides taking to . websites, books and national television to argue their points. A petition on change.org seeking to have him freed has collected hundreds of signatures. Another challenge for prosecutors is making a legal argument that resonates with jurors after the two previous failures. Camm, . who had left the state police four months before his family was killed, . was arrested a few days after telling investigators he had discovered . his wife and their two children shot to death in the garage of their . Georgetown home September 8, 2000. The weapon was never found. Defense . attorneys argued at Camm’s first trial in 2002 that prosecutors ignored . evidence that another man had been in the garage where killings . occurred. After DNA . linked a violent ex-convict to the scene, they thought Camm would be . freed. Instead, prosecutors said Camm had conspired with the second man . to kill his family, and he was convicted again in 2006. The second man, Boney, is serving a 225-year prison sentence for murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Legal fumbles: Camm (center) has been found guilty twice, but both convictions were later overturned on appeal . Conspiracy theory: Ex-con Charles Boney (left) was convicted of the murders and sentenced to 225 years in prison, but the prosecution believes he was acting alongside Camm (right) Boney’s palm print was found on Kimberly Camm’s SUV, and a sweatshirt found in the garage had been issued to Boney in prison while he was serving time for armed robbery and criminal confinement. Both times, appellate courts ruled that prosecutors had deliberately inflamed the jury, in the first trial by calling a dozen women who testified they had extramarital affairs with Camm, and in the second by suggesting he had molested his daughter without any evidence to back up those statements. The third trial is expected to last at least six weeks amid heightened security at the Boone County Courthouse, about 25 miles northwest of Indianapolis. Floyd County Prosecutor Keith Henderson, who won the second murder conviction against Camm, won’t be there. He was removed after signing a book deal regarding Camm’s case, though he said the deal later was dropped. The Renns plan to be in court, hoping for closure and a chance to heal. ‘Hopefully one day we'll wake up and this will never have happened. But common sense tells you it won’t be that way,’ Mr Renn said. Crime scene: Camm told investigators that he returned from a game of basketball on the night of September 28, 2000, and discovered his family slain in the garage of their Georgetown, Indiana, home . Resting place: The grave site of Kimberly Camm and her two young children, Brad and Jill . Both David Camm and Kimberly Renn were born and raised in New Albany, Indiana. The two met in 1988 and got married a year later - three years after Camm had divorced his first wife. Also in 1989, David Camm was accepted into the Indiana State Police as a trooper recruit. The young couple had their first child, Bradley, in 1993, followed by Jill in 1995. According to some accounts, the Camms' relationship took a turn for the worse shortly after the birth of their son, with the husband allegedly starting an affair with another woman, which culminated with him briefly moving out of the house. By the time their daughter was born, however, the Camms’ life appeared to be back on track. The family finished construction on their new house on Lockhart Road in Georgetown, and things were seemingly going well, with David Camm serving as a state trooper with the Indiana State Police Sellesburg District, and his wife advancing her career as a well-paid financial analyst. In March 2000, about four months before the killings, Dave resigned from his post with the state police and went to work for his uncle, who owned a basement waterproofing business. September 28, 2000, began like most . days in the Camm household, with Kimberly waking up at 6am, followed by . David and their kids a short time later. The . husband kissed his family goodbye and left for work. About an hour . later, Mrs Camm headed out with the children, dropping off Bradley at . his elementary school and Jill at her pre-school. After . making arrangements with her parents to stop by later in the day, . Kimberly Camm drove to her work at Capital Holding Insurance Company. At . around 4pm, she left to pick up her daughter from school and take her . to dance practice. After . 6pm, Kimberly took her son to his swimming practice at New Albany High . School. Shortly after 7pm, the Camms set out for home, located about 11 . miles away. Meanwhile, . David Camm left work just before 7pm and drove to a nearby church, where . he arranged to play a pickup game of basketball with a group of . friends. Costly case: It is estimated that by the time Camm's third trial reaches its conclusion, the state will have spent $4million in taxpayers' money on the case . Grieving parents: Janice, left, and Frank Renn hold a photograph of their daughter Kimberly Camm in their New Albany home . Seeking closure: In an undated photo, Janice and Frank Renn, center, are seen in a family portrait from Christmas of 1999 with their daughters Kimberly Camm, left, Debbie Karem, right, and their grandchildren Jill and Bradley Camm . Just before 9.30pm, Dave Camm placed a frantic call with the ISP Sellersburg, where he had worked for 10 years, reporting that he found his wife and children shot dead in the garage of their home. The prosecution, however, rejected David Camm’s version of events, accusing him of murdering his family in order to pursue affairs with other women. During his first trial, the 11 people who took part in the basketball pickup game on the night of September 28 testified in Camm's defense, telling jurors that he was at the gym at the time of the murders. But the prosecutors claimed that Camm could have sneaked out to meet up with ex-convict Charles Boney and kill his family. Camm was convicted the first time in 2002, but the verdict was thrown out two years later, the Indianapolis Star reported. He was found guilty a second time in 2006 - a conviction that was also overturned on appeal in 2009, when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors inflamed the jury by making baseless accusations that Camm had molested his daughter. It is estimated that by the time Camm's third trial reaches its conclusion, the state will have spent $4million in taxpayers' money on the case.","David Camm, 49, was found guilty in 2002 and 2006, but both convictions were overturned .

The husband of an Oregon barista who disappeared en route to work earlier this week sobbed uncontrollably during Thursday’s press conference and was hardly able to utter a word as the missing woman’s mother begged for her daughter’s safe return. ‘It hurts to breathe right now,’ Lorilei Ritmiller told reporters while speaking of 21-year-old Whitney Heichel. ‘But we just want to find her and we're not going to stop.’ Heichel was reported missing by her husband, Clint Heichel, after she failed to show for her 7am shift at a Starbucks in the Portland suburb of Gresham. The drive from her apartment complex to the coffee shop takes less than five minutes. Scroll down for video . Heart-rending: Clint Heichel, husband of Whitney Heichel, 21, brakes down as he attempts to speak at a press conference Thursday . Just hours after Thursday’s emotional press conference, children playing in an apartment complex several miles away from Heichel’s home found what is believed to be the missing woman’s cell phone. Parents of one of the children told KATU that the device was spotted in bushes outside the Troutdale Terrace Apartments Thursday evening. The family said the phone had a screensaver of a picture of Heichel and text messages from her relatives asking if she was okay. ‘I was pretty shocked. I mean I knew right away ... I recognized the face,’ April Fletcher, the mother of one the girls, told ABC News. The apartment complex is about four miles away from Heichel's home in Gresham. Police have not confirmed whether the phone belongs to Heichel. Investigators said Heichel's ATM card was used at a Troutdale gas station at 9.14 am. Two hours later, her sport utility vehicle was found in the Wal-Mart parking lot in Wood Village with the passenger side window smashed. Missing: Whitney Heichel, pictured with her husband Clint, vanished on her two-minute drive to work . Search: A map of Gresham, Oregon shows the short distance between Heichel's home and her work, and the spot where he cell phone was found . Gresham police said at a press conference Thursday that they have interviewed the Troutdale gas station attendant, examined surveillance video and canvassed the neighborhood where Heichel lives. Lt. Claudio Grandjean declined to say if Heichel was seen after 7am, or to say who may have been driving her SUV. Police said they recovered potential evidence during searches of Dodge Park and Larch Mountain, remote, forested places east of Gresham where they believe the SUV was Tuesday morning. ‘There has been property recovered at different locations, but we can't positively say that that property is related to this,’ Police Chief Craig Junginger said. Ritmiller said her daughter's nickname within the family is ‘Mama,’ because she's always been like a second mother to everybody, including her six siblings. Ritmiller added that her daughter is a hard worker, a devoted Jehovah's Witness with a ‘heart as big as the sun,’ and her greatest hope is to have children of her own. Tragic: Sobbing Clint Heichel gets a hug from Lorilei Ritmiller, Whitney's mother, during the press conference . Desperate plea: While Clint Heichel, left, was too overcome with emotion to speak to reporters, her mother, right, begged for the 21-year-old's safe return and said that her family is not going to stop until she's found . ‘She's wanted to be a mama since she was two years old and I brought her sister home,’ she said. ‘That was just her biggest hope, to have babies.’ Grandjean said police received 25 phone tips Wednesday and another 21 overnight. Two dozen detectives have been assigned to the case that has been classified as a suspicious disappearance. Though he acknowledged that the first 48 hours are very important in a missing-person case, he stressed that the case is far from cold. ‘The leads and the evidence we've gathered have not gone cold, and so we continue to push forward until we find Whitney,’ he said. Heichel left her apartment, which she shares with her husband, in Gresham, Oregon at 6.45am on Tuesday for a 7am shift but failed to turn up to work. Six hours later, her SUV was found with a smashed window in a Walmart parking lot four miles from her home - and police learned it had been seen at a gas station in the hours in between. Friends said that a gas station attendant claimed the vehicle had been driven by a man, who was acting 'suspicious and hurried', as Heichel sat in the passenger seat. Her husband, Clint Heichel, told Fox 12 that he learned of his wife's disappearance when her manager at Starbucks called to say she had not arrived for her shift. Fears: Six hours after she left home, her car was found with a smashed window in a parking lot . Hunt: Clint alerted authorities after she failed to turn up for work on Tuesday in Gresham, Oregon . 'She got dressed this morning, normal everything. Kissed me goodbye, said goodbye,' he said on Tuesday. '(At) about 8:15 her boss called me and said, ""Hey, I was just curious, did . Whitney decide to be sick or not feeling well? Have you seen her or . talked to her?""' he told KATU. Mr Heichel tried calling and texting her, but she did not respond. Worried, he drove to her parents' home . and then to a hospital in the area, as well as calling family and . friends to see if anyone knew of her whereabouts. When they could provide no further . information, he called police to report her missing at 9.56am, and . friends and family began distributing flyers and searching for her. Detectives learned that her vehicle, a black 1999 Ford Explorer, was seen and her ATM card was used at a gas station three miles from her home at 9.14am. Her . missing poster claims an attendant said she was in the passenger seat next to a man, who was 'acting suspicious and hurried'.

Concerns: Police confirmed that her SUV was seen at a gas station before the vehicle was found in a car park . At 1pm, family and friends looking for . Heichel found her vehicle, with the passenger window smashed, at a Walmart in Wood Village, around four miles from her home. It appeared as if someone had rummaged through the car, according to her missing poster. 'The passenger side window was busted . out, the backseats were down, there was mud on her tires, which it . wasn't that way the night before,' Clint Heichel said. 'It just is weird that we found her truck, completely off the path that she would take to go to work.' He added: 'Anyone who has a loved one or is . married knows if your spouse goes missing and there's no word... I don't . know what to say, I don't know what to think, I don't know what to do.' Details: Family and friends have been handing out flyers in the area in the hopes of gathering information . Gresham police said that there is surveillance . video showing the SUV at the gas station, but the video . is poor quality and detectives are unable to see who is driving the car.

Smith, 29, was transferred to Hollesley Bay prison at Woodbridge, Suffolk, just weeks after being jailed for more than five years . A bank raider who has gone on the run from a notorious open jail was moved there just two months after he was locked up. Kevin Smith, 29, was transferred to Hollesley Bay prison at Woodbridge, Suffolk, just weeks after being jailed for more than five years. The bank raider escaped from the jail on Monday just 10 days after arriving. Smith was part of a four-man gang who stole £34,000 from a Barclays Bank cash point at Kimbolton, Cambridgeshire, in September 2012 after ramming it with a JCB digger in a late-night raid. Smith, of Spalding, Lincolnshire, was jailed for five years and three months at Peterborough Crown Court in July. Smith was jailed for conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to steal a motor vehicle. He had been remanded in custody since being arrested last December, which could explain why he was moved so quickly to the low-level security facility. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) last night branded the decision to move him there 'absolutely ridiculous'. The organisation also warned that fast-tracking inmates into insecure open jails is putting the public in danger. Glyn Travis, POA assistant secretary and spokesman, stormed: 'It's absolutely ridiculous. 'This demonstrates that the tick-box mentality of allocating prisoners is not fit for purpose and puts the public at risk. Prison staff contacted police at 5.45pm on Monday to report that he was not present at a 5pm security check . 'The observation, classification and allocation of prisoners is outdated, inefficient, and doesn't do anything to serve the public.' He added: 'The Government prison quota closure programme will do nothing other than endanger the public because prisoners are being moved down (to open prisons) far too early in their sentences and will no doubt commit more crimes at a significant cost to the taxpayer.' Prison staff contacted police at 5.45pm on Monday to report that he was not present at a 5pm security check. Lifer Gregory Dennett, 43, also went missing from Hollesley Bay on Monday - bringing the total for the last year to 12. Dennett had been behind bars for nine years after carrying out a homophobic attack in Luton, Bedfordshire. He failed to return after being given resettlement leave to Luton. Dennett was serving a life sentence for wounding with intent to do GBH. Police have warned the public not to approach either men, but to telephone 101 if anyone knows their whereabouts. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'The number of absconds from open prisons in 2012/13 was the second lowest since records began, but we are determined to do more. 'We are working on plans to put prisoners on temporary release on a tag, which will allow us to better track their movements and enforce curfews and exclusion zones. 'This will ultimately help us to protect the public better. 'Anyone who does abscond - or fail to return to prison after a period of temporary release ~ will be returned to a closed prison and may face further criminal charges.' Disgraced peer Jeffrey Archer served part of his four-year sentence at Hollesley Bay. Lord Archer was freed in September 2003 after two years after being jailed for perjury and perverting the course of justice.","Bank raider Kevin Smith escaped from jail just 10 days after arriving .

Struck off: Grace Adeleye was banned from ever practising as a nurse in the UK again after a baby died during a home circumcision . A nurse who let a three-and-a-half week baby bleed to death after carrying out a circumcision using just scissors, forceps and olive oil has been banned from practising in the UK. Grace Adeleye, 67, performed the dangerous African treatment known as a 'clamp and cut' on Goodluck Caubergs for a fee of £100 at the baby's home in Chadderton, Greater Manchester. A Nursing and Midwifery Council panel heard that Adeleye carried out the circumcision at around 5pm on April 16 2010 and that Goodluck was still bleeding at 7am the following morning. Adeleye had reassured the baby's parents, whom she had been put in touch with by a mutual friend, that the bleeding was slowing. But Goodluck was eventually taken to the Royal Oldham Hospital later that morning where he died shortly after arrival. A post mortem later found he died from blood loss. Sitting in London today, the panel ruled that Adeleye, who was found guilty of manslaughter at Manchester Crown Court on February 9, should never work as a nurse in this country again. NMC panel chair, Karen Heenan, said: ‘Ms Adeleye’s actions resulted in the death of a three and a half week old baby. ‘She has provided the panel with no evidence of insight or remediation and as such the panel cannot be confident that there would not be a repetition of her actions. ‘The panel therefore decided that a Striking-Off Order was the only sanction which was sufficient to protect the public. ‘The panel was further concerned at Ms Adeleye’s failures to obtain informed consent and to provide the parents with any written or verbal information regarding aftercare, either before or after the procedure.’ Adeleye had previously received a 21-month jail term suspended for two years at Manchester Crown Court and quickly announced she would be retiring from nursing. The court heard the nurse had performed thousands of similar procedures with each one costing £100 as she operated from a mobile clinic. Tragic: The three and a half week old baby was rushed to the Royal Oldham Hospital in Greater Manchester but died soon after arriving . Many of the parents whose babies Adeleye treated were unaware that the simple procedure is available on the NHS. Adeleye, who did not attend her central London hearing, was struck off with immediate effect. Most circumcisions in the UK are done for religious reasons but currently no formal qualifications are required to perform the operation.","Grace Adelaye was struck off at a Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing .

A jury took just 13 minutes to acquit a woman who was accused of stealing almost £250,000 pounds from the former wife of one of Britain's richest men. Susan Butt was found not guilty today of stealing the cash from Joyce Harrison, ex-wife of multimillionaire computer magnate Sir Peter Harrison . The 48-year-old defendant wept as the . jury returned two 'not guilty' verdicts on charges that she had betrayed her relationship as the mother of Mrs Harrison's . grandchild to steal the money after she had suffered a stroke . in 2011. Afterwards the Harrison family was accused of persecuting the defendant, whose 11-year-old daughter would return home from school and ask if she was going to prison. Miss Butt, of Hookwood in Surrey, had been the live-in lover of Mrs Harrison's wayward son Nick, and had a daughter by him, the jury heard. But she left him after suffering years of domestic abuse. The trial at Guildford Crown Court heard she and Mrs Harrison forged a close relationship to escape from the super wealthy family, which was described by Miss Butt's defence counsel Justin Rouse as 'spectacularly abnormal' and 'violent'. Mrs Harrison, who died last year aged 77, received £20 million after she divorced Sir Peter in 2005 following years of domestic abuse. The trial heard Mrs Harrison bought Miss Butt a £650,000 house in Reigate, Surrey, and agreed to give her a further £249,000 pounds to set up a restaurant business with her current, boyfriend Andre Baker. Sir Peter, who amassed a personal fortune of £300 million when he sold his computer business, hired a private investigator to probe the money his former wife had given away to Miss Butt . The evidence was passed to the police, who decided to bring charges of theft and fraud against Miss Butt. But the jury cleared Miss Butt of any wrongdoing. Miss Butt was too upset to speak to reporters after the case concluded today. However, Mr Baker accused Sir Peter of 'persecution'. He said: 'This was the right decision - justice has been brought. This case should never have come to court. 'This has been hanging over us now for two years. In that time, our business has gone to the wall and £250,000 pounds has been lost because of the persecution of this family. 'At the centre of all of this has been her (Miss Butt's) 11-year-old daughter, who has been coming home each day saying ""are you going to prison mummy?"" 'That's their granddaughter, for God's sake. How can they have done that do their own flesh and blood?' Speaking outside court, Sir Peter said: 'I was here for justice for my former wife Joy, but sadly the jury did not see it that way. 'That is the way our justice system works, so I respect the decision of the jury.' During her trial Miss Butt claimed she came to be regarded as a daughter-in-law by Mrs Harrison. The court heard she left the volatile relationship with son Nick and was given money by Mrs Harrison to help her become independent. Mr Rouse said Mrs Harrison and Miss Butt had forged a close bond due to their shared experience of domestic abuse in the Harrison household. He said businessman Sir Peter was a domestic abuser and had a violent temper. Multimillionaire: Sir Peter Harrison (left) leaves court during the trial of his former housekeeper and mother to his granddaughter, Susan Butt (right), who was cleared today of theft and fraud . He told the jury: 'She (Joyce) was happy to be helping Sue to be independent of her son. 'She did not care, you may think, how Sue decided to spend the money. She was happy to help her.' The trial heard Mrs Harrison had given Miss Butt and Mr Baker £650,000 to buy a house, which was signed off by trustees of the Harrison family fortune. But the prosecution claimed Miss Butt then wrote herself cheques from Mrs Harrison’s HSBC account to the tune of £237,500 to start a restaurant called Pacific Bar and Grill in Reigate, Surrey. The blank cheques were alleged to have been fraudulently filled out by Butt between September 4, 2011, and February 9 last year after Mrs Harrison suffered a series of strokes. Mr Rouse denied this. He descrbed the Harrison family as 'spectacularly abnormal', adding that Mrs Harrison’s son was 'estranged to her and was violent'. In a damning statement, Mr Rouse said: 'This (Nick) was someone who had been inside. He had a cocaine addiction. He had an addiction to drink. 'He was someone who you may say had a feckless youth, and Peter Harrison wanted him to settle down. 'Peter Harrison is a shrewd judge of character and in this woman Sue Butt he found someone who brought stability. 'Essentially, she was a brood mare. She was someone who was going to bring him (Nick) a son.' He added: 'You can’t be surprised Joyce Harrison wanted to bring some normality into that child’s life. 'The fact is Nick Harrison was given a great deal of money - it was referred to in interview as £80million - far too early. 'As someone once said: ""If you want to know what God thinks of money, look at the people he gives it to.""' Mr Rouse described Joyce Harrison as a 'lovely person' who found herself trapped in the 'clutches of the Harrison family'. He added: 'After her divorce, she was a lady who was 70 and who went off with £20million pounds. 'She had escaped the Harrisons and how had she done that? She had done it with the help of someone she referred to as her daughter-in-law.' The prosecution case had relied on a witness statement from Mrs Harrison written shortly before her death. In it, the millionairess said she did not know about the Pacific Bar and Grill venture and felt 'betrayed' by Butt. However, Mr Rouse said the statement was fiction. He said: 'You heard crocodile tears from the prosecution about her not being here. 'It would have been catastrophic for the prosecution if she had been here because she would not have recognised that statement.' Sir Peter, the former chairman and chief executive of Chernikeef and vice-chairman of Chelsea Football Club, was present throughout the trial. Miss Butt was also cleared of fraudulently attempting to cause a £12,000 cheque to be paid to the Pacific Bar and Grill on February 8 last year.","Former housekeeper to the wealthy Harrison family cleared of theft .

When it comes to middle-aged men and their pet projects, a Harley-Davidson or even a lawnmower will normally suffice. But not for builder Neil Banwell who has spent the last six years repairing a Falklands Sea Harrier he secretly bought on eBay without telling his wife. The 45-year-old paid £10,000 for the iconic fighter plane which dropped cluster bombs during the conflict with Argentina in 1982. Scroll down for video . Pet project: Neil Banwell, 45, stands in the cockpit of his Harrier Jump Jet which dropped cluster bombs on Port Stanley airfield during the 1982 Falklands War. The plane also saw action during the Bosnia war before it was retired - and bought by Mr Banwell on eBay for £10,000 in 2007 . Secret project: Neil Banwell bought the plane on eBay without telling his wife Jo. He said she was 'shocked' at the time - but has now grown to love it . Caravan park jump jet: The Sea Harrier XZ494 is kept in a hangar at the campsite Neil runs with his wife in Wedmore, Somerset, and it is popular with visitors . He now estimates the jet he bought in 2007 is worth up to ten times what he paid for it but he does not want to part with it. Mr Banwell said his wife Jo, 49, was livid when she found out he had bought the plane without telling her. 'First of all she was a bit shocked and said ""what have you done?"". Now she has grown to love it,' he said. 'It was a spur of the moment thing but hopefully it has been a good investment.' He added: 'I saw the Harrier advertised on eBay. I’d never been on the site before but me and my daughter put a bid on it and actually won it the same day. Restoration: Neil Banwell has spent hours sourcing and replacing missing parts on the plane which were missing when he took delivery of it in 2007 . Air force: The Harrier Jump Jet, which can no longer fly because the engine has been removed, used to be capable of going from 735mph to hovering in the air . The Sea Harrier FRS1 played a key role in winning the Falklands War under Margaret Thatcher in 1982. In total, 28 of the £35million planes saw action in the conflict and they shot down 20 enemy planes. None of them were lost in action on the frontline, although six were destroyed in accidents and ground fires. The planes are pictured above on board HMS Hermes during the Falklands War. A second upgraded Sea Harrier plane - the FA2 - was manufactured from 1993. The planes, which were introduced in 1978, subsequently saw action in the Bosnia War between 1992 and 1995. They were deployed again in 1999 in Yugoslavia and in Sierra Leone in 2000. However, the Labour government announced the planes would be phased out in 2002 - and the last one was decommissioned in 2006. The plane was also sold to the Indian Navy - and they still use a number of the planes. 'When I first got it, I used to spend quite a bit of time sitting in it and playing with all the buttons and levers but I don’t seem to have as much time now.' The 43ft Sea Harrier ZX494 came with two 30mm cannons and the original ejector seat. However, the explosive charge was removed from the seat to stop the Neil from accidentally being fired from the cockpit. The £250,000 Pegasus engine and computer system were removed because of flying restrictions in the UK. Neil said it could be made airworthy again at the cost of ‘hundreds of thousands of pounds’. When it arrived from the Suffolk-based dealer he discovered it was also missing many parts on its exterior as well as the full tanks, the nozzle on its stencils. He scoured eBay and phoned specialist dealers searching for the missing parts. He . also spent hours bringing its general condition up to scratch in a . hangar at the back of the campsite he and his teacher wife run in . Wedmore, Somerset. The fighter jet, which was capable of hovering after slowing from speeds of up to 735mph, has become a big draw for campers. This is in part thanks to its action-packed war history. The . fighter was built in 1980 at a cost of £35 million and taken for its . first flight by a John Farley. It was then housed at 899 Squadron at . RNAS Yeovilton. When the . Falklands War broke out it was transported to the south Atlantic onboard . HMS Hermes, setting off from Plymouth in early April, 1982. The . fighter flew its first combat mission on May 1, 1982 when it was . piloted by Black Leader Lt Cmdr Andy Auld during a a raid on Port . Stanley airfield. According to the mission log it . dropped three cluster bombs on ‘airfield facilities, parked aircraft and . other targets of opportunity’. Cluster munition is now banned by 83 nations around the world. During . the conflict, Sea Harrier XZ494 was one of 28 Sea Harriers that flew a . combined 1,435 operational missions and shot down 20 enemy aircraft and . probably three others. It later flew missions during the Bosnia War from 1992-1995. The Royal Navy’s last British Aerospace Sea Harrier fighters were retired on March 28, 2006. Neil, . who grew up in Somerset, near RNAS, Yeovilton, said: 'I love Harriers . because I grew up in this area and they used to fly over all the time.

It is the moment every airline passenger dreads - when the person in front suddenly reclines their seat so you can barely move. Almost a third of flyers say the practice has caused them discomfort, and 3% have even suffered an injury. Now a survey shows 9 out of 10 travellers want to see an end to it once and for all. No more sitting back: A poll shows 91% believe short haul flights should either ban or set special times for seat reclining (file picture) A poll shows 91% believe short haul flights should either ban or set special times for seat reclining. And nearly half (43%) think there should be limits on long haul journeys too. Global travel site Skyscanner quizzed over 1,000 flyers for the survey which also revealed some people were just downright selfish. Nearly three quarters (70%) would not be put off reclining their seat even if the person behind was pregnant while 80% would not care if the person behind was elderly or frail. Women aged 18 to 24 were the most thoughtful while the most egotistical travellers were likely to be men over the age of 35. Selfish: Nearly three quarters (70%) would not be put off reclining their seat even if the person behind was pregnant while 80% would not care if the person behind was elderly or frail (file picture) And while irritation and anger could be reduced if a passenger asked permission to recline their seat, the study found a third of people were too worried about the reaction they’d receive, and most (64%) had never done so. An all-out ban on recliners could well be music to the ears of air stewards. Over 60% of 900 international cabin crew who were also questioned say said they have been involved in, or witnessed, an argument between passengers on the subject of reclined seats. Psychologist Dr. Becky Spelman, Clinical Director at the Private Therapy Clinic in Harley Street said she was not surprised at the survey results. She said: 'The strong support for a change in reclined seat procedures makes sense . 'The effect of people reclining their seat can result in various negative emotions such as anger, stress, anxiety, frustration and upset for the passenger behind them. 'This emotional impact can result in a whole range of unhelpful behaviours, including air rage.' She said that was partly because there were two general personality types while travelling- the ‘Altruistic Soul’, who is considerate of fellow passengers, and the ‘Selfish Ego’ who looks to increase their comfort at the expense of others. She added: 'Set times for seat reclining on planes could actually make for an improved experience for passengers. 'Such rules tend to ensure better social cohesion, as people are conditioned to obey boundaries. 'While these rules place a limit on the personal choice passengers have over their own comfort, people will generally adhere to them, accepting that it is fair. This could lead to a more pleasant flying experience for the majority.'","Survey by Skyscanner quizzed 1,000 flyers and 900 cabin crew .

If you happen to be driving through Liverpool, you might want to take a little more care than usual. Inhabitants of the city are some of the dodgiest drivers – clocking up more penalty points than any other place in England and Wales. Figures have revealed that the city has the highest proportion of motorists with points on their licence, with one in eight drivers picking up endorsements for speeding or other driving offences. Penalty points: A survey has revealed motorists in Liverpool commit the most traffic offences in England . Out of the 433,425 licensed drivers in the city, some 52,179 – or 12 per cent – have at least one point. And 1,802 people have collected a staggering nine or more points. Liverpool was followed by Bournemouth where 11.5 per cent of drivers have points. Other places on the list include Blackburn, Slough, Dorchester, Sunderland, Warrington, Chester, Manchester and Nottingham. By contrast the area of England with the lowest proportion of penalty point transgressors is the ‘EC’ postcode of London, where just one in 18 has been caught committing a driving offence. The area’s well-behaved motorists are followed by Truro in Cornwall, the ‘WC’ London postcode, Canterbury and Exeter. But across the whole of the UK it is the Scots who are the penalty points leaders of Britain. Motoring magazine Auto Express, who have analysed the figures in their latest edition, said: ‘The city of Glasgow and the surrounding area make up four of the five worst areas for driving offences.’ In Glasgow alone, one in seven of the city’s 634,252 drivers have points. Motherwell landed in second place, followed by Kilmarnock and Paisley. The magazine added: ‘Liverpool may have the worst penalty point rate in England, with around 12 per cent of licensed drivers possessing endorsements. ‘But four of the other worst five postcodes in the UK for driving offences come from around the Glasgow area.’ However representatives of the charity who provided the original data rushed to defend Glaswegian drivers, saying the spike was simply down to high levels of traffic policing around the city. Cycling charity CTC’s policy co-ordinator Chris Peck said: ‘It just can’t be just down to driver behaviour that one in eight Glasgow drivers has penalty points, but just one in 20 has in Shetland.’ Worst performers in Wales are Swansea where one in 10 (10 per cent) of the 462,165 drivers have points and Newport (also 10 per cent) - both just ahead of Bradford (10 per cent). Nationally, across the UK more than 3.3 million motorists have endorsements on their licences – or 8.9 per cent of the total. And 97,562 have nine points or more. Across the UK, Lerwick in the Shetland Islands has the lowest proportion of licensed drivers with points where just four per cent of the 14,956 drivers have endorsements, followed by the Outer Hebrides (4.9 per cent). Cycling charity CTC which provided the original data believes the wide discrepancies between areas is mainly due to differing levels of traffic policing. The charity’s policy co-ordinator Chris  Peck said: ‘It can’t be just down to driver behaviour that one in eight Glasgow drivers has penalty points, but just one in 20 has in Shetland. 'The loss of road traffic policing hasn’t been even. Overall, there are a third  fewer road traffic police today than there were 10 years ago – but the reduction has been greater in some forces than in others.’ Streets ahead: Drivers in Glasgow are the worst offenders in the UK, where one in seven has points .","One in eight drivers in the city have points on licence for traffic offences .

"By . Liz Hull . PUBLISHED: . 13:29 EST, 20 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:30 EST, 20 September 2013 . Thousands of motorists given points after being caught speeding on a motorway with ‘illegal’ warning signs could have their cases dropped, it emerged yesterday. Two motorists who faced a ban from driving after they were caught speeding on the stretch of M42 near Birmingham have already had their cases dropped. The decision to shelve the test prosecutions of both drivers could lead to an avalanche of claims from thousands of other motorists who accepted penalty points, paid fines or had their licences revoked - and now want their convictions overturned. Illegal: Thousands of motorists could see their speeding cases dropped because variable warning signs displayed speed limits with the numbers the wrong size . It also means millions of pounds could have been wrongly taken from motorists in fines and fixed penalties by the police and Government. The men, both national sales representatives who feared their jobs would be on the line if they were banned, were snapped travelling over the limit on the M42, near Birmingham Airport last year. But their solicitor, Matt Reynolds, later discovered that overhead warning signs next to the police enforcement camera had been fitted with the ‘wrong shaped numbers’ and were technically unlawful. The revelation, in November last year, led police and the CPS to suspend prosecutions for several weeks, costing the Government thousands of pounds in lost revenue. However, prosecutors refused to acknowledge the mistake and reopen the cases of thousands of other drivers caught by the camera, which was operating next to the illegal signs for 13 months from October 2011. Instead they insisted on vehemently fighting the two test cases, which had been listed for trial later this year. Wrong size numbers: The 'illegal' signs were in place on a number of motorways around the UK (file picture) Only after Mr Reynolds discovered, through requests made under the Freedom of Information Act, that the Highways Agency and the CPS knew the signs were unlawful all along did they finally agree not to go ahead with the prosecutions. He obtained minutes of meetings which . revealed both organisations were aware enforcement should have stopped . 12 months earlier, in late 2011. Earlier . this week, once the CPS realised Mr Reynolds had seen the minutes, they . announced it would ‘not be in the public interest’ to contest the two . cases. Last night Mr Reynolds, of Just Motor Law, accused the CPS and Highways Agency of orchestrating a ‘cover-up.’ Anyone caught speeding along the M42, between junctions seven and nine, between October 2011 and November 2012, is likely to have been affected. However, the signs could have had an impact on thousands more motorists after the Highways Agency conceded that variable speed signs and cameras have been used on other stretches of motorway, including the M42, between junctions 3a and nine, M40 at junction 16, M6 at junctions four to five and junctions eight to 10a, M1 at junctions 6a to 10 and 25 to 28, M20 at junctions four to seven and M25 between junctions 10 and 16 for several years. If you’ve accepted points or been on a speed awareness course and paid the fixed penalty the only way to appeal is by writing to the chief constable of the police force concerned and arguing you have been treated unfairly. It will be at the discretion of the force as to whether to reimburse and revoke points of motorists. If your case went to court, you will need a solicitor to go back to magistrates and argue for the case to be re-opened in a bid to have the conviction quashed and any fines or costs re-paid. For more information e-mail enquiries@justmotorlaw.co.uk. He said Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin should intervene to ensure the thousands of motorists, who’ve been caught by the camera next to the rogue signs, have their points revoked, fixed penalties repaid, convictions quashed and fines reimbursed. ‘This latest development changes everything,’ he said. ‘It gives hope to motorists who have arguably wrongly paid fixed penalties, been banned, paid for speed awareness courses or suffered hiked up car insurance premiums because of the Highways Agency mistake. ‘It is of huge concern that the authorities have seemingly covered up the unlawfulness of the signs, presumably because of the huge amounts of money that would be involved in organising reimbursements and paying the money back. I have had to make Freedom of Information requests to unearth the truth. ‘Shortly after the CPS became aware that the minutes of these meetings were in the possession of the defence they discontinued the cases. I find it hard to believe that the timing of this decision was a coincidence. ‘In the circumstances it is only fair and consistent that all speeding convictions associated with these speed limit signs during this period are overturned and indeed all fixed penalties reversed and drivers refunded. ‘Had motorists known at the time that the signs were unlawful they may have reasonably contested the allegation.’ The signs, known as Advanced Motorway Indicators (AMIs), introduced on the M42 in 2006, were illegal because numbers used to display variable speed limits did not exactly match those prescribed by the Department of Transport. According to the Highways Agency the numbers were in a different font to those stipulated by DfT regulations, which made them appear ‘taller’ and ‘stretched.’ Signs on the M1, M4, M5, M6, M20, M25 and M40 were similarly affected. Only following intervention from the Secretary of State on November 27 last year were the signs deemed legal and prosecutions resumed. Last night one of the men affected, a sales director in his 50s, said: ‘My livelihood was potentially at stake because of this. ‘The police and Highways Agency have known for months that the signs they used on the M42 were unlawful, but still they insisted on fighting the case. ‘I’m very relieved that it has now been dropped, but what about the thousands of other motorists who have accepted fines and points on their licences which should never have stood?’","Two motorists speeding on the M42 have already had cases dropped .

A man whose skull was smashed to bits in a horrific lawnmower accident has had it replaced using an implant created with a 3D printer. Michal Lesiow, 31, from Kutna, Poland, was taken to hospital with grass, mud and bone fragments in his shattered skull after the rotary lawnmower ran over his head as he cut grass outside his house. He can't remember how the accident happened, and said: 'All I recall is that I woke up in a ditch with a cracking headache, like I'd been punched or hit by a car. Michal Lesiow, 31, is lucky to be alive having received a 3D printed skull implant after an accident with a lawnmower left him out cold in a ditch . 'The police were there and told me not to move and then an ambulance turned up.' When Mr Lesiow got to hospital he was told he was missing part of his head. Dr Pawel Kolasa, head of neurosurgery at the hospital in Lodz where Mr Lesiow was taken said: 'The patient had massive trauma to the skull with a hole showing part of the brain. 'He was lucky to have survived.' Surgeons at Lodz hospital, Poland, carefully fitted the 'printed' skull implant which had been created to exactly fit the gaping hole . The exact shape of the skull implant was created out of polypropylene by the printer . Dr Kolasa called upon fellow surgeons Professor Marcin Kozakiewicz and radiologist Dr Martin Elgalal who have spent the last two years developing 3D printing applications for bone reproduction. They took a 3D scan of Mr Lesiow's head, and then recreated the missing part of his skull from polypropylene, using the 3D printer. Using this method, the replacement skull is exactly the right shape to fit the gaping hole where the shattered bone was removed. Doctors first took a 3D scan of Mr Lesiow's head to get a multidimensional image of the missing area of skull . Information from the 3D scan is fed into the 3D printer, which the begins to build the skull implant from layers of special plastic . Dr Kolasa and fellow surgeons Professor Marcin Kozakiewicz and radiologist Dr Martin Elgalal have spent the last two years developing 3D printing applications for bone reproduction .

Which is why the retail tycoon won’t be depriving his children of their multi-million pound inheritance, fearing they wouldn’t be able to cope without the luxury lifestyle he has given them. Paphitis, 54, who is worth £180million, said he disagrees with other millionaires such as his former co-star on the BBC2 show Duncan Bannatyne, who insist they won’t pass on their fortune to their children because it would ‘ruin’ them. Traditionalist: Dragon Theo Paphitis pictured with his wife Debbie, said he was a family man who would not be depriving children of their fortunes . Paphitis, who has five children with his wife Debbie, said that suddenly taking away their privileged lifestyles risked ‘driving them to places you don’t want them to go’. He said: ‘My view is very simple. I’m a traditionalist, a family man, I love my kids. I believe I have brought them up the right way. They are all very  different, they have different drives, different ambitions. They are never going to be me. They are going to be themselves. Not so generous: BBC 2 co-star Duncan Bannatyne insists he won't pass on his fortune to his children . ‘We support each other and there is no reason why I shouldn’t support my children. I, on the other hand, had absolutely nothing, apart from the love of my parents. You make your kids what they are, so what do you do? ‘Do you not get them used to a lifestyle? What happens when they become 18 and they are used to a certain lifestyle and then you say, “I’m going to take it away?” ‘How do you know they are capable of coping with that? How do you know that’s not going to drive them somewhere to a place you don’t want them to go anywhere near because of it? You can’t do that.’ Paphitis, who used to ask contestants on Dragons’ Den, ‘Why should I spend my children’s inheritance on that?’ has three daughters and two sons, Dominic, 34, actress Zoe, 32, Alex, 26, and twins Holly and Annabelle, 17. The son of Greek Cypriot immigrants, Paphitis started work aged 15 as assistant to the tea boy at brokers Lloyd’s of London. Just seven years later he had set up his first business. He now owns hardware chain Robert Dyas, stationers Ryman and set up lingerie brand Boux Avenue two years ago. He is also the face of the Government’s auto-enrolment pension initiative. In 2009 Bannatyne said he will not leave a penny of his vast fortune to his children, claiming he will leave it to charity instead. He suggested it would ‘not be good for them’ to inherit such a large sum.","The 54-year-old disagrees with millionaires who do not pass on wealth .

Even the most hardened insomniac would struggle to count all the sheep at Britains' biggest one day lamb market. Hundreds of farmers from all over the nation flock to Lazonby Mart in Cumbria to inspect some of the best lambs in the land. An estimated 17,500 mule gimmer lambs, from the upland and hillfarms of northern England, went under the hammer at one of the biggest events in the farming calender. The lambs, largely born and bred on the Lakeland Fells, the Pennines and Alston Moors, are highly prized for their ability to thrive and for their prime meat. Baa-rmy army: Thousands of lambs went on sale at Lazonby Mart in Cumbria, the largest auction of its type in the UK and a major social event among farmers . Woolly mammoth: Visitors turned up in their droves to check out some of the finest sheep on the market . And with an average of 1750 lambs an hour leaping through the ring, the auctioneers were selling at breakneck speed from 9.30am until 7.30pm. The mule sheep, a cross-breed from a Swaledale ewe and Bluefaced Leicester ram, are noted for being good mothers, often producing two lambs, and for their hardiness. However, the harsh winter and spring have taken their toll on even their sturdy stock. Richard Hodgson, foreman at Lazonby Mart, said: 'We have around 17,500 lambs on the catalogue, which is 1600 down on last year. 'There are a lot less lambs, which is due to a bad winter followed by a terrible spring. More lambs were lost but mostly it was due to more single lambs being born rather than twins. Famous: The sheep auction at the Lazonby Mart in Cumbria has become increasingly popular . With around 17,500 lambs being sold in a single day, the sale ring is packed with farmers from across the UK . By the end of the day, farmers were expected expected to have paid somewhere around £1.75m for the animals . 'We are expecting prices to be a bit down on last year's trade because there isn't a lot of money flying about in the farming industry at the moment. There isn't the money about because it was an expensive winter.' He said last year's cold and wet summer resulted in poor crops, which in turn led to higher feed prices. He added: 'The price of feed went up from £160 to £250 a ton and with it being such a bad winter, more of it was needed, so times are tougher. 'Fortunately we've had a wonderful summer this year, the harvest is in and the hay and farmers are now on with their potatoes, so hopefully it bodes well for next year.' In pre-19th century England and Wales, the majority of the population made their living through agriculture and livestock farming. Most people lived where they worked, in the fields far from towns, so farmers and their families herded cattle and hauled their produce to markets in nearby towns. Since many livestock are herd animals, they were historically driven to market 'on the hoof' to a town or other central location. Market towns became so important to rural life it was incorporated into their names, such as Market Drayton, Market Harborough, Market Deeping and Market Weighton. As traditional market towns developed, they had a wide main street or central market square for people to set up stalls, booths and display livestock for auction. A rich social scene grew up around the auctions, with farmers often descending upon taverns in their droves before, after and during the selling. Locally-raised sheep from Alston Moors, the Pennines, Dales and Lake District fells went up for auction . The event was always well-attended and anticipated by the sheep farming community, although it wasn't as much of a social event as it was in decades past . The harsh winter and spring have taken their toll on even their sturdy stock. Richard Hodgson, foreman at Lazonby Mart, said: 'We have around 17,500 lambs on the catalogue, which is 1600 down on last year' Mr Hodgson, 62, said the event was always well attended and looked forward to by the sheep farming community although it wasn't as much of a social event as it was in decades past. He said: 'It's more business-like now - people still like to meet up and have a good chat but there's not the same craic and the characters there used to be. 'Farmers used to arrive the night before and meet up in the pub, there was a lot of banter. It's more workmanlike now and there are fewer ""characters"" than there were. 'However, it's still a good day out. Hopefully everyone will come and buy some good lambs and go home happy!' The highly sought-after lambs are mainly from hill farms giving them a glowing reputation for thriving when moved to other parts of the country . The spectacle was caught as thousands of Mule Glimmer lambs were inspected by potential buyers and tourists from across the country .","Around 17,500 mule gimmer lambs went on sale at one of the biggest events in the farming calendar .

Middle-class parents claiming child benefits will have to register for assessment by the end of the week or face hundreds of pounds in fines. Higher income parents have to submit their details HM Revenue & Customs or they could be given a fine equal to what they owe. This Saturday’s deadline comes after child benefit was scrapped in households where the breadwinner earns £60,000 or more. High income parents face fine if they do not register for child benefit assessment by Saturday . The new policy requires parents to either opt out of receiving the benefit or submit a self-assessment form by October 5 so that HMRC can calculate how much needs to be given back. Child benefit is a tax free payment that allows parents to claim £20.30 a week for their eldest or an only child, and £13.40 a week for any other offspring. People can claim for all children under 16 or those under 20 if they are in full 'non-advanced' education. In total almost eight million families with 13.7million children are paid the cash by HMRC, . But controversial changes in 2012 meant that George Osbornee slowly withdrew it for families with individual parents earning more than £50,000. Since January those earning more than £60,000 don't get anything and those between £50,000 and £60,000 have had it eroded. Government policy demands unless they submit a self-assessment form by . October 5 they face fines worth what they were paid. The form allows HMRC to calculate how much needs to be given back to them by these high earners. HMRC said it would impose a fine of 100per cent of what is owed only if it is clear the individual was ‘evading’ paying back their benefit. So far, about 220,000 of 1.1million affected parents have yet to register the form. HMRC said as long as parents register and pay the tax due by January 31, any penalty for missing the October deadline would be removed. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said unsuspecting parents could be hit with large fines if they are unaware of the deadline. ‘I really do worry that whatever HMRC is saying there are going to be lots of people who find out too late they are expected to be paying something back, that they’ve missed a deadline and could well be facing a penalty. ‘There are large numbers of people who have no idea this affects them and they don’t realise self-assessment is something they are now going to be drawn into. Mr Roy-Chowdhury said the new tax policy . will hurt parents who need financial support: ‘It’s such a dysfunctional . way of taxing people. ‘In most cases the person in a household who doesn’t receive the benefit is going to have to pay for something his or her partner is getting. Think about where couples are separating, for example.’ So far 220,000 of 1.1million affected parents have yet to register the child benefit form . Claire Paye, from Mothers at Home Matter, said full-time mothers are being undervalued in the push to cut child benefits. She said: ‘It seems unfair that two parents both earning £40,000 a year can continue to receive child benefit where a household where one earns £50,000 will not. ‘It’s completely disjointed and to me shows the Government simply does not put a value on mothers staying at home and being there for their children.’ Parents who stopped child benefit payments before January 7 2013 do not need to take further action. Tina Riches, director at the Chartered Institute of Taxation, said: ‘What may seem like onerous form-filling is ultimately about helping people to pay the right amount of tax. ‘Those already enrolled in self-assessment need not worry about the 5 October deadline, but those for whom it does apply should act quickly.’","Higher income parents must submit details to HM Revenue & Customs .

Boris Johnson tonight tore into the UK Independence Party, warning a vote for the anti-EU party would hand election victory to Labour. The Mayor of London burnished his Eurosceptic credentials, claiming people are twice as likely to be murdered in Brussels as in London – blaming Eurocrats ‘bumping off their husbands with poisoned profiteroles’. But arriving at the Tory party conference in Manchester without the media hullabaloo seen in previous years, he appeared to go further than ever before in ruling out one day running for party leader. Thumbs down: Boris Johnson rejected the overtures of the UK Independence Party insisting voters Labour could slip into power . Mr Johnson’s appearance at the Conservative gathering has become an tradition of media scrums, jokes and leadership ambition. But with David Cameron’s position at the helm of the Tory party considered more secure, Mr Johnson’s appearance at a rally tonight was more low key. Before addressing delegates, he used an interview with Bloomberg to go further than before in apparently ruling out rrunning for party leader. He said: ‘I have no such plans.’ Asked clarify whether he still has ambitions to lead the Tories. ‘Ever, now, whenever.’ However, he did allow himself to take a mild swipe at Mr Cameron, mocking him for the photo posted on Instagram by his sister-in-law sleeping next to his red box. The photograph was taken by Emily Sheffield as her sister Alice prepared for her wedding day and posted on Instagram, apparently not realising it could be seen by anyone. Direction: The Mayor of London visited McKenna Bothers, makers of destination boards in Middleton, during the second day of the Conservative party conference in Manchester . Business: Mr Johnson said investors were drawn to a booming London, but would be deterred if Labour returned to power . The London Mayor delivered a typically erratic but joke-filled speech at the conference, where he revealed how he had rejected a request from Kirsten Farage, wife of UKIP leader Nigel, to address their party conference. ‘It’s time to lash myself to the mast and resist the siren song of Kirsten Farage, I said to myself, because with a general election less than two years away there is only one relevant fact. ‘And that is that her party would deprive me and everyone in my generation of a chance to have a vote on Europe in a referendum. ‘Because they would help to put Miliband in power, and I don’t to give back the economic management of this country to the people who were on the bridge when the ship ran aground.’ In a sustained attack on the Labour party, Mr Johnson withdrew his recent remarks claiming Ed Balls and Ed Miliband ‘belonged to the Costa Concordia school of helmsmanship’. He added: ‘I meant the Titanic school of economic management, or the Amoco Cadiz or the Torrey Canyon or the Exxon Valdez. ‘Or whatever metaphor you pick to convey the scale of the most disastrous economic shipwreck of the last 50 years.’ Rejection: Mr Johnson revealed he had turned down an invitation to speak at the UKIP annual conference alongside Nigel Farage . He dismissed criticism from Labour’s Yvette Cooper making comparisons between crime rates in London and Rio. ‘After 5 years of a Conservative mayor, with common sense policies of putting more police on the street and increasing patrols we have the murder rate down to the lowest level since 1969, when Yvette Cooper wasn’t even born. ‘You are about 20 times more likely to be murdered in Rio as in London, about 4 times more likely to be murdered in New York. Open door: Mr Johnson appeared to go further than previously in ruling out running for Tory leader . ‘And you are more than twice as likely to be murdered in sleepy old Brussels where they have 3 murders per 100,000 as opposed to 1.3 in London. ‘Heaven knows what they are doing there – bumping off their husbands with poisoned profiteroles I expect.’ Mr Johnson insisted London is now the safest global city in the world which is why investors are flocking to the capital, drawn to the upgrades of the Tube and Crossrail. ‘We want to continue in London with that work, and we don’t want Labour with its 1970s blend of divisiveness and business-bashing and union control. ‘What is the definition of a millisecond? The time it takes Ed Miliband to follow the instructions of Len McCluskey.. ‘What is the definition of a millimetre? The distance Ed will deviate from union diktat. ‘And I say to the charming Mrs Farage and her friends don’t vote for UKIP because we will see this country sleepwalk into a Labour government UKIP if you want to – David Cameron’s not for kipping not unless, obviously, he’s at his sister-in-law’s wedding. ‘My friends we are in a far better position than we could have dreamed; we can win the argument about living standards and show that we are the party with the serious policies to continue creating the conditions for a sustained and durable private sector recovery. ‘And we can show that this is the best way to spread opportunity, to generate jobs, to tackle poverty and inequality and to take Britain forward. ‘We won the argument in London in 2012, between short term fool’s gold and investment in our city; we are seeing exactly the same pitch from Labour in the country as a whole – and I have no doubt we can win in 2015.’ Putting his feet up: David Cameron is pictured snoozing next to his red box behind his sister-in-law on her wedding day .","Mayor of London launches attack on UK Independence Party .

Help: Ofsted Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said private schools should be supporting those in the state sector . Independent schools are offering nothing more than the ‘crumbs from their tables’ to state schools they should be supporting, the head of Ofsted said yesterday. Sir Michael Wilshaw said private schools should be supporting those in the state sector. But many give the impression they only do their duty ‘when push comes to shove’, he said. Many offer little more than coaching for A-level students or the use of playing fields, he claimed - providing ‘ammunition’ for critics who think strict quotas should be introduced to give more university places to state school pupils. The chief inspector of schools quoted Independent Schools Council figures that only three per cent of members - 34 schools - were sponsoring or co-sponsoring an academy school and five per cent were loaning teaching staff. In his speech to leading independent headteachers at a conference in London, he reminded them many of their schools had been founded with a mission to help underprivileged children. Describing it as his ‘Kitchener moment’, he said: ‘Your country needs you.’ He added: ‘The ISC’s list of activities is hardly evidence of a comprehensive commitment to partnership with state schools. ‘It’s thin stuff. These are crumbs off your tables, leading more to famine than feast.’ Sir Michael said if the private sector treated the state as a ‘rival’ they should ‘not be surprised if it returns the sentiment’. ‘It would be a moral retreat and a tactical mistake to confuse independence with isolation - haughty detachment can become a very tempting target,’ he added. Schools that ‘choose to remain aloof... only give ammunition to those who would like to put even stricter quotas on independent pupils’ access to our top, publicly-funded universities’. Universities charging fees above £6,000 now have to prepare ‘access agreements’ to show how they are widening access to include more teenagers from deprived backgrounds. Maintained schools have shown significant improvements in recent years, Sir Michael said. Against: Martin Reader, headmaster of Wellington School in Somerset (pictured) complained primaries and secondaries in his area ¿politically object¿ to private schools and had refused assistance . But he highlighted two main areas of concern - ‘huge’ regional variations in schools’ quality and underachievement among the poorest children’. He added: ‘Heads in inner city London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds haven’t got the time to worry whether their children are climbing trees proficiently. ‘These heads know that gaining academic qualifications is the one route out of poverty and disadvantage.’ The comments received a mixed reception at the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference annual meeting, with some in the audience angrily rejecting the accusation they were doing too little. Wellington School headmaster Martin Reader complained primaries and secondaries in his area ‘politically object’ to private schools and had refused assistance. Another delegate complained to Sir Michael that schools which offer help other than sponsoring academies ‘fail your test’. ISC general secretary Matthew Burgess said Sir Michael’s comments showed a ‘lack of understanding’ at the work independent schools do in the state sector. ‘Rather than focus on one prescriptive form of support clearly favoured by HM Chief Inspector, our schools use their independence to deliver tailored programmes in local partnerships,’ he added. ‘Our most recent census disclosed that over 90 per cent of our schools are already involved in genuine and meaningful collaborative work with their state sector colleagues.’ Sir Michael praised some schools including Eton, which has co-sponsored the London Academy of Excellence, a sixth form college in Newham, and Winchester, which has established a partnership with Midhurst Rother College in West Sussex.","Sir Michael Wilshaw said private schools are giving no more than 'crumbs'

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . PUBLISHED: . 18:50 EST, 2 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:52 EST, 2 October 2013 . Menacing: Private companies have been posting fines through drivers' doors as they take parking matters into their own hands . Motorists are facing a new menace after parking enforcement firms switched from clamping to issuing  tickets backed up by spy cameras. Some 2.3million drivers have now been hit with paper fines after clamping on private land was banned last year. But so many are contesting the new penalties that the official parking appeals service is struggling to cope with the backlog. The AA said cowboy clampers have simply ‘moved their sharp practices to private parking enforcement’. It says the new Parking on Private Land Appeals service (POPLA), set up a year ago to prevent abuses, ‘appears to be struggling to cope’. In a report out today that exposes the scale of the problem, the AA revealed just 6,913 of the 13,611 appeals submitted by the end of August have been considered so far. Some 3,361 were decided in favour of parking firms, while drivers won 2,856 cases and the rest remain undecided. POPLA’s own figures show that between October 2012 and March this year there were 1,537 appeals by motorists and 806 – more than half – were settled in their favour. The surge in tickets issued by firms comes 12 months after clampers were banned from operating in  private car parks in England and Wales after a campaign by the Daily Mail and the AA. Enforcement firms have since switched to operating cameras with automatic number plate recognition to issue tickets to drivers through the post. The move has also helped to fill government coffers. In just three months this year, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency earned £1.4million by selling the details of more than half a million drivers to parking firms so they can be pursued for tickets. Today’s report claims the ‘surge’ in the number of parking charge notices are attracting complaints from ‘Edinburgh to the south coast of England’. And it said there had been ‘a new and hard-line attitude by  private enforcement firms’. 'Free-for-all': AA president Edmund King hailed the end of 'extortionate' clamping but called for new regulations . It added: ‘With clamps no longer an option now in England and Wales it was inevitable that the number of parking charge notices – private parking tickets – would increase.’ AA president Edmund King added: ‘We are pleased that after decades of clamper extortion their practices have largely been consigned to history. However, private parking enforcement remains unregulated and is a free-for-all when even firms signed up to a code of practice breach their own rules.’ Recent cases include that of  Margaret Wilson, an NHS Trust administrator from Hayes in Middlesex, who received a £150 parking ticket – which breaches the £100 maximum recommended by the  British Parking Association. She said she had seen no warning signs and felt ‘threatened and intimidated’ into paying the £75 minimum within 14 days to the firm Civil Enforcement Limited. The DVLA earned £1.4million in three months this year selling drivers' information to private firms for fines . In another case, a diabetic was fined for sleeping beyond the two-hour limit at a deserted motorway service area after concerns about his blood sugar level. The British Parking Association (BPA) confirmed that Civil Enforcement Ltd was one of its members but said the firm was ‘under investigation’ for parking charges that breached its guidelines. However, the BPA admitted the guidelines were legally ‘unenforceable’ and that tougher laws were needed to protect motorists. Civil Enforcement Ltd, which is registered to an address in Liverpool, was unavailable for comment.","DVLA earned £1.4m in three months selling drivers details to private firms .

He murdered his landlady with an axe . Clamour for Britain to leave the European Court of Human Rights intensified last night, after the only UK judge on the panel called for axe murderers to be given the vote. The remark from Paul Mahoney, a bureaucrat who has never sat as a judge in this country, shocked MPs. ‘If you are killed by an axe murderer, I would still give him the vote – he would have a say,’ Mr Mahoney told a cross-party group of politicians in Strasbourg. The comment appears to be a reference to John Hirst, who served 25 years in prison after killing his landlady with an axe. Hirst has led the campaign for prisoners to be given the vote. Mr Mahoney claimed the Government should back down over its refusal to accept a ruling from his court that Britain’s blanket ban on prisoner votes is illegal. He said the decision was just a ‘fleabite’ on the independence of Britain’s judicial system – and suggested that defying the ECHR would damage the country’s reputation abroad. The comments enraged MPs at the meeting, which was held to explain how the court works. Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger said Mr Mahoney’s intervention merely strengthened the case for Britain withdrawing from it. ‘The idea of giving axe murderers the vote is grotesque and has been rejected by a huge majority in Parliament,’ he said. ‘They have forfeited the right to vote by their crimes. It is outrageous for [Mr Mahoney] to lecture us that the view of a sovereign parliament is less important than that of his court. ‘Britain has had enough of this court’s meddling in our affairs. It is not fit for purpose and, in my view, we should come out.’ Jeffrey Donaldson, a Democratic Unionist MP who also attended the meeting, said  ‘the idea of giving axe murderers the vote will repel most people’. He added: ‘If you are the family of a victim of such a crime, how would you feel to hear the highest court in Europe accord these rights to your loved one’s killer? Paul Mahoney, has spent three decades at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg . ‘From our experience in Northern Ireland, we would be very concerned about the idea of people convicted of acts of terrorism being given a vote in the democracy they have tried to overthrow.’ Tory MP Dominic Raab said Mr Mahoney’s comments reinforced the case for overhauling the Strasbourg court. ‘The only “flea” is the Strasbourg Court sucking the lifeblood out of our democratic authority, with each bite it takes in cases like John Hirst,’ he said. The ECHR has repeatedly ruled that Britain’s ban on prisoner voting is illegal under the European Convention on Human Rights. However, successive governments have refused to change the law, with David Cameron saying the thought of giving prisoners the vote makes him feel ‘physically sick’. In 2011, MPs voted to maintain Britain’s ban by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22. John Mahoney, a career eurocrat on £150,000 a year . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced last year that a joint committee of MPs and peers would consider three options. One would see the current ban retained, while the other two would allow some prisoners to vote; those serving sentences of less than six months, or less than four years. Ministers will then allow MPs to vote on one of these options. Mr Grayling said: ‘The British public want decisions taken about our democracy to be taken by our Parliament and not by an international court. That is why the Tories want wholesale reform of our human rights laws.' A spokesman for the ECHR confirmed there had been an ‘open and frank exchange’ of views when MPs met ECHR officials on Tuesday. He added: ‘The question of the right to vote of prisoners and the implementation of the judgment “Hirst v. the UK” was discussed. Judge Mahoney stated that the judgment – concerning an axe murderer – should now be implemented in the wider interest of the Convention system, and asked the members of the delegation to encourage this outcome at their level.’","Paul Mahoney told politicians killers should 'have a say'

When the store closed for the day, Overton disappeared with the £1,500 takings and went on a knifepoint robbery spree across the county plus neighbouring Staffordshire. Nine shop premises including off licences, newsagents and supermarkets were raided by Overton in August as police tried to track him down. The fugitive - originally from Sheffield, South Yorkshire - was eventually recaptured last month in a dawn swoop on a house in Crewe after being at large for 28 days.

Overton had originally received an 18-year sentence at Sheffield Crown Court in 2006 for 23 gunpoint robberies carried out upon shops across five counties over a two-month period. He and an accomplice Nigel Beever, then 37, were said to have got a 'sick thrill' from their crimes. Their total haul was just £8,500 but victims traumatised by the raids were too afraid to return to work. The men were caught after their getaway car was spotted in Sheffield. South Yorkshire Police at the time described their crime spree as a 'particularly protracted and worrying series of armed robberies.' One officer said they got 'more confident and brazen and weren’t going to stop until they were caught' and 'clearly enjoyed what they were doing.'

The low-cost airline, which was said to have breached a range of regulations between 2007 and 2010, intends to appeal the decision. Prosecutors told judges in Aix-en-Provence that Ryanair regularly employed local staff from Marseille on Irish contracts. This meant that instead of paying up to 45 per cent in contributions – the normal figure in France – they paid just 10.75 per cent in Irish charges. Passengers disembark from a Ryanair flight in Marseille, where the Irish air company has been fined £8.5million for breaching French employment laws . The court judgement read that this was viewed as ‘clear social dumping’ and that the case was ‘an issue of unfair competition against other airlines that respect national legislation’. Ryanair’s actual fine was 200,000 euros (£167,000) but it was also ordered to pay more than £7.5million in backdated contributions for using Irish-registered workers at its Marseille . transport hub between 2007 and 2010. Rival airline Easyjet has already been given fines of more than £1million for the same offence. Lawyers for Ryanair insisted that their crews in Marseille worked for an airline with a registered office in Ireland, and pointed out that they spent their working day on Irish-registered planes. 'Ryanair crews were correctly working under Irish labour contracts and paid Irish social insurance in accordance with the applicable European employment and social security laws,' the company said in a statement. Ryanair had four planes and 127 employees at Marignane airport, near Marseille, without applying French employment laws or filling out tax declarations in the country. Prosecutors had even urged the Aix-en-Provence court to symbolically confiscate four Boeing 737s based at the site - a request which was refused. Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, whose company was today fined 8.3million by a French court . The civil plaintiffs in the case, which include a pilots' union and a pensions fund, were seeking more than £8million in damages. Roland Rappaport, a lawyer for the SNPL pilots' union, had urged the court to 'make an example' of Ryanair in its ruling. Prosecutors said there was no doubt Ryanair was operating in France, given that it had material and staff based permanently at the airport, and its employees lived in the area. 'We are dealing with a company whose only goal is to counter the law in defiance of the interests of workers,' said prosecution papers. Ryanair confirmed it had expected a 'negative ruling and a fine', adding in statement: 'Ryanair confirms that it will appeal any such negative ruling and any attempt by the French authorities to seek payment of social insurance payments which have already been paid in full in Ireland.' Ryanair has suffered negative publicity in . France over the Marseille dispute even as it remained the country's 3rd . largest airline, with more than 3million passengers in 2010. The . court's ruling also mentioned the airline's practice of drawing public . subsidies in regions surrounding its air transport hubs, typically . secondary airports far from major urban centres which allow it to save . money on airport taxes. 'This will . serve as a reminder to all those who pay big subsidies to Ryanair that . they can no longer support illegal activity,' said Claire Hocquet, a . lawyer for SNPL. Public bodies that continue to . subsidise Ryan could be 'called to order,' she added. The . ruling, not the first airline punished for labour . violations in France, highlights tension between protective local . employment law and EU rules on labour mobility. The .

A senior consultant killed a patient who went into private hospital for a routine knee operation by giving ‘exceptionally bad’ care, a court heard today. David Sellu, 66, of Hillingdon, west London, ignored concerns that James Hughes, 66, was in excruciating pain following a simple procedure to replace the joint, the Old Bailey was told. Mr Hughes, a retired builder from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, sustained an unexplained tear to his bowel during his stay at the BMI Healthcare-run Churchill Clementine Hospital in Harrow, London. Prosecutor Bobbie Cheema QC told the jury he was in so much pain he called a doctor friend from his private hospital bed because he could not explain to the Hungarian doctor on duty the agony he was in. James Hughes (left) was in excruciating pain, the Old Bailey heard. Although Dr David Sellu (right) knew his patient had a perforated bowel, he failed to operate for 40 hours, the jury was told . He was given paracetamol and the pain started to ease. But by 3.15pm his pain rating was ‘nine out of 10’ and there was a ‘sudden spike’ in his temperature, jurors were told. This serious condition quickly led to blood poisoning and Mr Hughes suffered a fatal heart attack on February 14, 2010. Although Sellu knew his patient had a perforated bowel, he failed to operate for 40 hours, the jury was told. The surgeon went on to lie to Coroner Andrew Walker, claiming to have viewed the 66-year-old’s scans much earlier than hospital records showed, it is alleged. Opening the case, Ms Cheema said: ‘This is a fairly common procedure and his consultant operated on him that day. ‘The operation went well and he was due to leave the hospital on Monday, February 16. ‘However... after the operation, while he was still in hospital, he developed abdominal pain.’ Sellu, a general surgeon with a specialism in colorectal conditions, was asked to treat Mr Hughes, the jury was told. ‘The defendant agreed to do so and he saw Mr Hughes that evening’, Miss Cheema said. The Old Bailey heard that Mr Hughes was in so much pain he called a doctor friend from his private hospital bed because he could not explain to the Hungarian doctor on duty the agony he was experiencing . Sellu quickly concluded Mr Hughes was suffering from a ruptured bowel, the court heard. ‘This is a serious and life-threatening condition and it requires an operation. ‘However, Mr Sellu did not agree for an operation to be performed immediately. ‘Instead he decided to have a CT scan performed the next day. ‘However, again the defendant failed to carry out urgent surgery, even after being told the result of the CT scan. ‘He did not treat Mr Hughes’ case as an urgent case’, Miss Cheema said. By the time Mr Hughes was brought into theatre, he ‘had been in pain for over 40 hours and was in a critical condition’. ‘The defendant did what he could to repair the damage, operating into the early hours of that Saturday morning. ‘Sadly, these efforts were all too late. He died the following day. ‘That death was avoidable. ‘Had Mr Sellu simply operated the night before, or even early during the day of the February 12, Mr Hughes would have had a very good chance of survival. ‘There was a series of missed opportunities and serious errors of judgment in his care of this patient and they combined to cause Mr Hughes’ premature death and the standard of care was exceptionally bad.’ The ‘catalogue of breaches of duty’ amounted to manslaughter by gross negligence, Miss Cheema said. ‘During the Coroner’s inquest into Mr Hughes’ death, this defendant was called to give evidence and before that he had supplied two statements for the purpose of the inquest. ‘The coroner asked him when had he first seen the results of the CT scan which he had delayed...he said it was around lunchtime. ‘The inquest was adjourned without reaching any verdict, but when the defendant’s evidence on that point was examined against electronic records that are held at the hospital. ‘These records demonstrated - without doubt - that Mr Sellu had first looked to see the records no earlier than 9pm, not around lunch as he had said. ‘The prosecution case is that in giving that evidence, which was untrue, this defendant deliberately sought to mislead the Coroner.’ Sennu was a senior lecturer in surgery at Imperial College from 1993 to 2000 and is an associate professor at a Florida University. The trial is expected to last between three and four weeks. Sellu denies manslaughter and perjury. The trial continues.

Women are not being appointed as top judges in Britain because the selection process is ‘dominated’ by men, the country’s most senior woman judge has suggested. Lady Hale, the deputy president of the Supreme Court, said she was disappointed that since she was made a Law Lord in 2004, no other woman has followed in her footsteps. Men might be more likely to pick other men because it was easier to see merit in ‘people who are like you’, she said. Since her appointment, 13 lawyers have been elevated to sit in the country’s highest appeal court as a judge, first in the House of Lords and from 2009 in the Supreme Court. Lady Hale, a former High Court and Court of Appeal judge, said: ‘Most of you will also know that while I am flattered and proud to have been the first woman appointed as a Law Lord in 2004 I do not want to be the last.’ Of all the 20 or so senior politicians and judges who have to be consulted on appointments to the Supreme Court, she is the only woman. And the five-person selection committee which made three appointments - all men - to the court earlier this year, only one was a woman. Lady Hale said: ‘I think of the people who have to be consulted, I am the only woman. ‘I do not know whether the fact that the appointments process is dominated by men has anything to do with the choice of people. ‘It would not be impossible to speculate that it is always much easier to perceive merit in people who are like you than it is to discern the merit of those who are a bit different.’ She added: ‘I am disappointed that in the 10 years since I was appointed not one among the 13 subsequent appointments to this court has been a woman. ‘Now, things are improving in the lower ranks of the judiciary, but regrettably not here.’ Lone ranger: Of all the 20 or so senior politicians and judges who have to be consulted on appointments to the Supreme Court, she is the only woman . However, she rejected the idea of positive discrimination. Lady Hale also said judges and barristers should ditch the wigs they wear in court. ‘My main objection is that they are men’s wigs. Of course, that is one of the reasons why the early women barristers wanted to wear wigs. 'It was because they wanted to look like everybody else.

Sickness fear: Frances Osborne believes British people need to learn to stay at home when they're poorly . Frances Osborne has admitted to suffering from ‘germ stress’ when she encounters someone who is poorly. The Chancellor’s wife confessed to feeling ‘paralyzed’ when confronted with people who are under the weather and that the British should learn to stay home when they are sick. But the 44-year-old author also said there was an ‘art to socializing sick’, involving ‘medicines, makeup, and discreet coughs’. She made the comments in an American magazine, and recalled attending a dinner where one of the guests had come despite feeling ill. ‘Next to me was a man who might have been charming had he been able to talk,’ she told Town and Country magazine. ‘As it was, he could barely croak between deep, chesty coughs. When he didn’t have a handkerchief to his nose, it was running a marathon.’ She admitted spending the entire evening fearful of catching the infection, saying ‘the last thing anybody at that benefit signed up for was exchanging a donation for a fever’. She added: ‘And, because we were in England, he said, “Jolly poor show not to show up, don’t you think?” ‘I nodded and mumbled yes a couple of times in between his guttural noises. But what I wanted to say—what I wish I had been brave enough to say—was, “Go home now! No one wants your cold!”’ Mrs Osborne, who has written two biographies and a novel, admitted that cancelling last minute risks looking like a 'flake', and said she had attended events when she felt ‘at death’s door’. ‘The problem is that my phlegmy fellow diner had a point. From many a host’s perspective, only the most dire of circumstances excuse a late-stage cancellation,’ she said. She revealed that she attended a . sibling’s wedding recently despite feeling poorly and said it was . example of a social occasion which requires ‘either attendance or an . ambulance’. But Mrs Osborne added that those who do decide to soldier on should keep a stiff upper lip. Risk factor: Mrs Osborne, who joined her husband the Chancellor at the Tory conference this week, pictured above, admits people do risk looking like a 'flake' by cancelling engagements last minute . But Mrs Osborne, pictured left with her husband in 2009 and right in September this year, admits there are some engagements people must attend no matter how they are feeling - such as family weddings and events . ‘The only thing worse than showing up sick to a social event is showing up sick and admitting it. However bad you feel, the onus is on you to hide your symptoms. ‘There is, I’ve come to learn, an art to socializing sick. It involves medicines, makeup, and discreet coughs into corners of rooms. ‘It requires massive amounts of antibacterial lotion, wide-berth air kisses, fibs, and whatever else it takes to alleviate fears of contagion.

Four months ago, Harriet Wright, 15, decided to have her leg amputated and she can now march with her fellow Air Cadets . A teenage Air Cadet has marched for the first time – after asking surgeons to amputate her left leg. Harriet Wright, 15, was born with club foot, she only had a third of the calf muscle she should have had in her left leg, and she had severe arthritis in her ankle joints. She also had foot drop – the inability to lift the foot and toes properly when walking. As a result, she experienced years of treatments and pain. So, four months ago, the schoolgirl took the decision to have her leg amputated. Just a week after undergoing major surgery Harriet was back at school sitting a Media and Film studies GCSE that she passed with an A grade. Before the surgery she broke toes on her left foot about six times because of her foot drop. She said: ‘The operation was the best thing in the world for me. ‘I was in a wheelchair for a year before the operation. It really got me down that I couldn’t march alongside my peers, I hated being in the wheelchair, unfortunately the pain stopped me from being able to do it. ‘Now, 12 months on, I can stand on parade and will be doing full marches with the Air Cadets in the coming months. ‘To stand alongside them and bang the drum was the best feeling in the world. It may have rained on the parade, but nothing can take away the sense of joy I have at being able to stand tall without the pain. ‘I was in constant pain before and in last year’s march I was in a wheelchair in agony with my foot and ankle hurting so much. ‘There is not a hint of regret about the decision. I had no doubts that what I was doing was the right thing.’ Harriet, from Stockport, added: ‘Before the operation my consultant asked: “What will you do if the man who loves you says something about your limb?” But I replied that doesn’t matter, he’ll love me for who I am.’ Harriet explained that before the operation her left leg was a lot shorter than her right one. Harriet was born with club foot. She only had a third of the normal amount of calf muscle in her leg and had severe arthritis in her ankle. She also struggled to lift her foot up when walking so kept breaking her toes . Before her operation, Harriet (pictured at a parade a year ago) was in a wheelchair and suffered agonising pain in her leg. Her mobility was also decreasing rapidly . Just a week after undergoing major surgery Harriet was back at school sitting a Media and Film studies GCSE that she passed with an A grade . Doctors used a frame to try and stretch . it but this failed to help her walk as the nerves in her foot did not . work properly meaning she could not lift it up and routinely broke her . toes. Her mother, Amanda, 47, said: ‘Harriet got an A in the exam just a week after the operation and we are all in awe of her, she is inspirational. ‘When she had her operation, she simply said it was the best thing in the world, there was not a hint of regret. When Harriet was a child (pictured) she had numerous procedures to help treat her club foot but she remained in pain and still struggled to walk . Harriet said: 'The operation was the best thing in the world for me. I was in a wheelchair for a year before the operation. It really got me down that I couldn't march alongside my peers, I hated being in the wheelchair' ‘We had discussed it two years before . and the consultants wanted second opinions to make sure, but Harriet . started deteriorating quite rapidly - her movement became more and more . limited. ‘When she was walking in the house she . would be breaking her toes, she did it six or seven times as if she . didn’t pick her knee up high enough, her toes would drag behind and . break if she knocked them on the stairs or the floor.’ Her father Tim, 48, who manufactures paint in the family firm, added: ‘We’re absolutely delighted for Harriet - at last she has a pain free existence.’ Harriet said: 'There is not a hint of regret about the decision. I had no doubts that what I was doing was the right thing' The doctors are amazed at the amount of activity Harriet has already undertaken and say she’s months ahead of a normal recovery. Harriet is now trying to raise money for two new prosthetic limbs not available on the NHS - one for social purposes and another for cycling.

It causes the foot to point down and inwards with the soles of the feet facing backwards. It affects one baby in every 1,000 in the UK and the cause is unknown. Boys are twice as likely to be affected as girls and about half of the children born with club foot have both feet affected. The first treatment involves using a cast to gently manipulate the foot into a better position. Most babies then need surgery to allow the foot a more normal range of movement. The child will then need special boots attached to a bar to hold the foot in place. In about 95 per cent of patients, this treatment is successful.

The number of hospital admissions for self-harm among teenage girls has jumped by 10 per cent in one year, figures show . The 'unprecedented toxic climate' that children are growing up in is causing an increasing number of teenage girls to self-harm, experts have warned. Hospital admissions for self-harm among teenage girls have jumped by 10 per cent in just one year, new figures reveal. In the 12 months to June, there were 13,400 cases of self-harm among girls aged 15 to 19 that required hospital treatment - up from 12,220 in the previous year. The England-wide data, from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), also shows 4,000 cases of self-harm among 15 to 19-year-old boys. The figures also showed boys were far more likely to need treatment for assault than girls - with 3,500 cases among 15 to 19-year-olds during the same period - down 24 per cent from the 4,580 cases the previous year. Lucie Russell, Director of Campaigns and Policy at the charity YoungMinds said: 'Every day we hear about the unprecedented toxic climate children and young people face in a 24/7 online culture where they can never switch off. 'Cyber bullying and ""sexting"", bleak employment prospects and a society obsessed with body image are creating a negative environment around children and young people. 'These findings must not be dismissed as simply an inevitable part of growing up. 'Last year our Parents’ Helpline received a record number of calls from parents concerned about the mental health or well-being of their child. 'We must take notice of these warning signs and act if we are not to see children increasingly struggling to cope.' Overall, there were 2.5 million hospital admissions for babies and children up to the age of 19 - a 0.1 per cent increase on the previous year. The report revealed that infections were the most common diagnosis, with 31,900 cases among boys and 19,200 among girls. In the 12 months to June, there were 13,400 cases of self-harm among girls aged 15 to 19 that required hospital treatment, up from 12,220 in the previous year . Boys accounted for nearly twice as many cases of asthma - 6,800 - as girls - 3,500. Among five to nine-year-olds, tooth decay accounted for 13,300 cases among boys and 12,000 among girls. HSCIC chairman, Kingsley Manning, said: ‘Today's report is one of the first to examine hospital activity for children in this country to such a significant degree of detail. ‘It highlights the differing reasons why children are coming through hospital doors in this country and in particular the marked variation between boys and girls in the conditions they are being treated for. Overall, there were 2.5 million hospital admissions for babies and children up to the age of 19 - a 0.1 per cent increase on the previous year . ‘The number of self-harm cases among girls and assault cases among boys makes for particularly compelling reading.’ The news comes after health experts said more needs to be done to improve care and support for children who suffer from depression as this could reduce the number of children being admitted to hospital after self-harming. Depression in children is more common than people think and there must be clear steps in place so health workers can deliver the best possible care to young people affected, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) said. If a medic suspects that a youngster is depressed they must endeavour to make a diagnosis and record it in the child's medical records, according to Nice's new quality standards. And experts also need to ensure that there is ‘age appropriate’ material so that children can understand their diagnosis and treatment, Nice said. Severe depression affects nearly 80,000 children and young people in the UK including more than 8,000 under 10s, figures suggest. Professor Gillian Leng, deputy chief executive at Nice, said: ‘Depression in children and young people is more common than people might think and can be particularly distressing, both for the child or young person affected and their family. ‘It is important there are clear steps in place to aid healthcare professionals involved in treating children and young people with depression, so that they can deliver the very best levels of care across the NHS.’ If you are concerned that you, or a child that you know, may be suffering from depression, visit www.youngminds.org.uk for advice.","In the 12 months to June, there were 13,400 cases of self-harm in 15 to 19-year-old girls that required treatment - up from 12,220 the previous year .

A car was flipped over and several fires set when college football fans rioted to celebrate a team victory. After West Virginia University defeated Oklahoma State on Saturday night, dozens of supporters took to the streets of Morgantown, causing major damage. WVU, which was last week named America's top party college, has a tradition of celebrating sporting success by setting fires. Scroll down for video . Vandals: A group of young men were filmed tipping over a car after a West Virginia University football game . The latest incident came following the school's 30-21 victory over OSU at Mountaineer Field. A group of young men were filmed trying to flip a silver Volkswagen, cheered on by a raucous crowd shouting, 'Flip it!' They succeeded in getting the car on its side, but ran away from the scene when a police officer approached. A video of the incident was posted on YouTube, but was later removed. Excitement: Three men were initially filmed trying to push the car onto its back . Effort: The vandals were encouraged by a watching crowd who shouted, 'Flip it!' Police are currently examining social-media posts about the vandalism in an effort to identify those responsible. A university spokesman said that if the perpetrators are found to have been WVU students, they will face punishments which could include suspension or expulsion. In addition to the car-flipping incident, 10 fires were set around the college town, with one person arrested and charged with malicious burning. Team effort: Bystanders went to help the rioters as they wrestled with the silver Volkswagen . Failure: They only managed to get the car on its side before running away when the police arrived . Lighting fires is a common way of celebrating victories by WVU's successful sports teams, the Mountaineers. The college was last week named the most party-loving in the U.S., ahead of the University of Wisconsin. The chaos regularly caused by WVU students last year led the mayor of Morgantown to suggest that the town could levy a $20 surtax on all undergraduates to pay for extra police and firefighters.","West Virginia University fans riot after 30-21 victory over Oklahoma State .

A new island that emerged off the coast of Pakistan following a devastating earthquake has been releasing flammable gas and killing sea life in the area. Dead fish have been spotted floating on the surface of the waters surrounding the island and visitors have heard hissing noises from the escaping gas.

A new island that emerged off the coast of Pakistan following a devastating earthquake has been releasing flammable gas and killing sea life in the area . The earthquake was . so powerful that it caused the seabed to rise and create a small, . mountain-like island about 600 meters off Pakistan's Gwadar coastline in . the Arabian Sea. Bahram Baloch, a local journalist told the BBC how residents could hear sounds of gas escaping. 'Although they couldn't smell gas, they did put a match to the fissures from where it was oozing, and set it on fire,' he said. 'We . put the fire out in the end, but it was quite a hassle. Not even the . water could kill it, unless one poured buckets over it.' An aerial view of the island which is thought to be about 60 feet (18 meters) high, 100 feet (30 meters) long and 250 feet (76 meters) wide . A Pakistani Navy team reached the island by midday Wednesday, navy geologist Mohammed Danish told the country's Geo Television. He said the mass was about 60 feet (18 meters) high, 100 feet (30 meters) long and 250 feet (76 meters) wide. 'There are stones and mud,' he said, warning residents not to try to visit the island. 'Gasses are still emitting.' Dead . fish floated on the water's surface while local residents were visiting . the island and taking stones as souvenirs, he added. Zahid Rafi, principal seismologist for the National Seismic Monitoring Center, said such masses are sometimes created by the movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea, pushing mud and earth up to the surface in something akin to a mud volcano. 'When such a strong earthquake builds pressure, there is the likelihood of such islands emerging,' he said. 'That big shock beneath the earth causes a lot of disturbance.' This liquefaction of sand layers takes . place after any earthquake, but these sudden islands are usually only . spotted after strong earthquakes, at least 7- or 8-magnitude events. Zahid Rafi, principal seismologist for the National Seismic Monitoring Center, said such masses are sometimes created by the movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea, pushing mud and earth up to the surface in something akin to a mud volcano . To get a better idea of what the island is made of and how permanent it is, scientists will have to get samples of the material to see if it's mostly soft mud or rocks and harder material . Scientists believe the 7.8 magnitude earthquake, which struck 145 miles southeast of Dalbandin in Baluchistan, triggered what is known as 'mud volcano'. They occur where there is a reservoir of . loosely compacted sediments buried beneath harder, denser rock and a . path is made to the surface. The seismic waves caused a movement of gases locked in the earth under the sea, pushing mud and earth up to the surface along with gas. These sudden islands are usually only . spotted after strong earthquakes, at least 7- or 8-magnitude events. Richard Luckett a seismologist at the British Geological Survey said that these mud volcanoes are relatively common in this area on both land and at sea. ‘They occur where there is a reservoir of loosely compacted sediments buried beneath harder, denser rock and a path is made to the surface,’ he told MailOnline. ‘There is a subducting plate boundary in this region where the Arabian plate is converging on the Eurasian plate at about 2cm a year and being pushed beneath it. ‘This is the same plate boundary responsible for the magnitude 7.7 earthquake.’ Scientists believe gases associated with the melting at the plate boundary contribute to heating the mud in the reservoirs and making it more fluid. ‘Certainly mud volcanoes are most common near this type of plate boundary, such as in Japan,’ said Dr Luckett. ‘It is known that mud volcanoes can be triggered by large nearby earthquakes – in fact the same thing happened in this area in 2001. ‘The exact mechanism for this triggering is poorly understood but the fact that mud volcanoes often occur without a triggering earthquake suggests that little extra impetus is required.’ To get a better idea of what the island is made of and how permanent it is, scientists will have to get samples of the material to see if it's mostly soft mud or rocks and harder material. These types of islands can remain for a long time or eventually subside back into the ocean, depending on their makeup. The 7.8 magnitude quake struck 145 miles southeast of Dalbandin in Pakistan's quake-prone province of Baluchistan, which borders Iran, on Tuesday . Dozens of people had already visited the island, said the deputy commissioner of Gwadar district, Tufail Baloch, who travelled by boat himself to the island this morning . Such land masses have appeared before off Pakistan's Makran coast, said Muhammed Arshad, a hydrographer with the navy. After quakes in 1999 and 2010, new land masses rose up along a different part of the coast about 282 kilometers (175 miles) east of Gwadar, he said. He said each of those disappeared back into the sea within a year during the monsoon season, a period of heavy rain and wind that sweeps Pakistan every summer. He said that in the area where the island was created on Tuesday, the sea is only about six to seven meters (23 feet) deep. Older residents of the coastal town recalled an earthquake in 1968 produced an island that stayed for one year and then vanished.","People have been warned to avoid the island as gases are still emitting .

It wouldn't win a beauty contest, but a Chinese scientist claims an ancient fish has the world's first face and it challenges current thinking on the history of human evolution. A newly-discovered fossil of Entelognathus - Greek for 'complete jaw' - was dug up in Yunnan in south west China and is the most primitive vertebrate to have a modern jaw. The ancient creature was about eight inches long and swam in the prehistoric seas 419 million years ago. It belonged to a group of early fish known as placoderms that had bony armour, or plates, on their heads and necks. A newly-discovered fossil of Entelognathus, an armoured fish that swam in the Silurian seas (illustration), was dug up in Yunnan in south west China. The 419-million-year-old fossil (inset) is prompting scientists to rethink how the living groups of jawed vertebrates acquired their characteristic features . The superbly preserved specimen shows its jaw is much more like that of a modern bony fish - offering a new perspective on early evolution . But the superbly preserved specimen shows its jaw is much more like that of a modern bony fish, offering a new perspective on early evolution. The gap between jawed and jawless vertebrates is so large that it is hard to work out the individual steps in the transition. This creature described in the journal Nature brings scientists closer to understanding when modern jawed animals with backbones such as sharks and bony fish emerged from a collection of jawed, armoured placoderms. Jaws enabled vertebrates to become predators; an important step in the development of complex forms such as humans. Entelognathus had jaw bone features previously restricted to bony fish called osteichthyans, as well as full body armour seen in placoderms. Professor Min Zhu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, said: 'Until now jaw bones have never been found in any placoderms.' Sluggish placoderms are believed to have become extinct due to competition from the swifter bony fish and early sharks. Dr Matt Friedman, of Oxford University and Dr Martin Brazeau, of Imperial College London, reviewed the study for the journal and said it challenges the view that the most recent common ancestor of jawed vertebrates resembled modern sharks. They believe it provides compelling evidence for the evolutionary link between placoderms and osteichthyans and adjusts our understanding of early evolution. The palaeontologists said: 'Jawed vertebrates - or gnathostomes - comprise the vast majority of back-boned animals. Entelognathus (illustrated), described in the journal Nature, brings scientists closer to understanding when modern jawed animals with backbones such as sharks and bony fishes emerged from a collection of jawed, armoured placoderms . 'Understanding their great success and the evolution of their anatomical marvels lies in reconstructing the nature of their most recent common ancestor. 'An entrenched assumption of classical comparative anatomy, which has gained some recent palaeontological support, is this precursor resembled a shark. 'Entelognathus demands a major rethink of where fossils fit relative to modern lineages and how these living groups came to acquire their characteristic traits. 'It will take time to fully digest the implications of such a remarkable fossil but it's clear a major re-framing of our understanding of early gnathostome evolution is now in full swing.'

British scientists believe it provides compelling evidence for the evolutionary link between placoderms and osteichthyans and adjusts our understanding of early evolution . The first four-legged animals colonised land 400 million years ago after fish fins evolved into limbs allowing them to crawl out of the water. But it took them another 80 million years to lose their fishy heads. Major changes to the jaw only began around 320 million years ago - occurring mostly in reptiles. The animals' early fish-like jaws were suited to tearing flesh rather than chewing plants. It is believed that reptiles evolved their jaws only after they had mastered breathing using their ribs, allowing them to devote their mouths to chewing.","Professor Min Zhu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, has discovered the fossil a new type of ancient fish called Entelognathus .

From making eye contact with a bartender to leaning over the counter, many people have secret strategies for getting served quickly at a bar. But now scientists have said it is as simple as where and how you stand. German researchers said busy bar staff choose customers to serve if they are standing facing the bar or are directly in front of them, instead of whether they have cash at the ready or are snapping their fingers. The scientists' study of body language is being used to develop a bartending robot that will be able to spot who really wants a drink and serve them in the fairest order. Scroll down for video . German researchers said busy bar staff choose customers to serve if they are standing facing the bar or are directly in front of them, instead of whether they have cash at the ready or are snapping their fingers . Researchers from the Bielefeld University found nine out of 10 thirsty customers adopted the subtle approach of deliberately facing the bar, which is the most successful for getting noticed and served, according to the study. By contrast, only one in 15 customers looked at their wallets to signal that they would like to place an order while fewer than one in 25 customers gestured at the bartender. Those not needing to quench their thirst subconsciously maintained a small distance to the bar and turned away from it by chatting to friends instead, signalling to staff that they did not want service, the scientists said. Psychologist Sebastian Loth said: 'Effectively, the customers identify themselves as ordering and non-ordering people through their behaviour.' The study, published in online journal Frontiers in Psychology, looked at recordings of customers at nightclubs in Edinburgh and Germany to analyse how their body language attracted the bar staff’s attention. The findings form part of pan-Europe research to develop a bartending robot that is able to spot who wants a drink. Scientists found only one in 15 customers looked at their wallets to signal that they wanted like to place an order while fewer than one in 25 customers gestured at the bartender . Named James after the EU-funded programme, Joint Action in Multimodal Embodied Systems, its head is a tablet computer showing big, comic-style eyes, which can establish eye contact with the customers. James' mouth moves in sync with its speech and the one-armed metal body forming its torso is fixed behind the bar, where James accepts drink orders, reaches for the drink using its arm and a four-fingered hand and serves them to its customers. The aim is to advance technology so that James can display socially intelligent behaviour that humans take for granted in daily life. Jan de Ruiter said: 'In order to respond appropriately to its customers the robot must be able to recognise human social behaviour.' James should be able to understand users who have no prior knowledge about the robot and who have not been briefed in any way. In the noisy environment of a night club, the system cannot rely on its language components alone so the robot learns how to interpret body language.

Named James after the EU-funded programme, its head is a tablet computer showing big, comic-style eyes, which can establish eye contact with the customers . Professor Ruiter added: 'Currently, we are working on the robot’s ability to recognise when a customer is bidding for its attention, thus, we have studied the process of ordering a drink in real life.' The robot requires a clear-cut definition of which signals indicate an order and which do not. Without a proper definition, it will misinterpret its customers’ signals, which could annoy people by responding inappropriately to their behaviour. The findings of the behavioral bar study were used to update James’ programming. Dr Loth said: 'With the update, James only talks to people whose position and body posture clearly indicate that they wish to order a drink. 'Only if the system is certain that the customers would like to order a drink, James will respond in Received Pronunciation ""How can I help you?"" But cutting the queue is a no-go with James. It maintains the order of the customers by memorising who came first.'","German researchers said busy bar staff .

Birds develop different 'accents' in their song depending on where they live, scientists said. A study of 723 male chaffinches in twelve different populations across the European mainland, the Azores and the Canaries found their notes became more unpredictable the further they moved. U.S. researchers believe that one reason, along with more mystifying ones, may be that island birds face less competition. Birds develop different 'accents' in their song depending on where they live, scientists said. A study of 723 male chaffinches in twelve different populations across the European mainland, the Azores and the Canaries found their notes became more unpredictable the further they moved . Whereas a female may be attempting to . pick out the right male among 60 other species singing all at once in . Europe, in the Azores she faces just eight others. The males are the singers and biologist Robert Lachlan, of Duke University, North Carolina, said: ‘One of the jobs the female has is to identify her own species.’ He compared the songs using a computer and discovered that the pattern of the notes, which he calls 'syllables', lost their syntax on the mid-Atlantic archipelago which the birds have colonised over half a million years. The research found the chaffinches living in Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands, still sing the same notes, but with a much less structured pattern from one bird to the next. Dr Lachlan said: ‘A chaffinch from mainland Europe always sounds like a chaffinch from mainland Europe.' But on Gran Canaria, it is much harder for a human to pick them out by hearing alone. The study, published in the journal Current Biology, found the syntax was gradually lost step-by-step matching the known dispersal of the species. U.S. researchers believe island chaffinches (pictured right next to a greenfinch) face less competition than their friends on the European mainland. Whereas a female may be attempting to pick out the right male among 60 other species singing all at once in Europe, in the Azores she faces just eight others . At the end of the island chain, it ‘is not just changing, it is disappearing,’ Dr Lachlan said. ‘It is not about changing the rules, it is about losing them.’ There are almost twice as many species on the Canary Islands as on the Azores, yet the Canary Island songs have much less structure, leading Dr Lachlan to say that 'other factors must also be involved.’ A large body of research has shown birds learn their species-specific song from their elders. The research found the chaffinches living in Gran Canaria (pictured) in the Canary Islands, still sing the same notes, but with a much less structured pattern from one bird to the next . But if cultural transmission were the only source of syntax, one would expect songs from the smaller island populations to have more than those from the mainland, Dr Lachlan said. Yet there is also a genetic component to that learning. Hundreds of genes have been identified which relate to song learning and singing. Studies show young birds have a genetic predisposition helping them pick out which songs they ought to be learning in order to develop typical songs. Dr Lachlan said: ‘It appears very likely what we measured is the result of the evolution of such genes.’ He believes one of two plausible explanations may be something called a ‘cultural trap’. ‘In small populations, like those on islands shortly after colonisation, an evolutionary interaction between culture and genetic predisposition favours individuals that can recognise and learn a wider range of songs - in this case, a wider range of syntactical patterns,’ he added. It may also be a case of ‘withdrawal of learning’. When populations are very small on the new island, young birds may find few tutors to learn from. Some would be forced to improvise, and this would introduce new songs into the at a higher rate than normal, leading to rapid change in structure. Now he has established this pattern of syntax loss across the islands, Dr Lachlan hopes to use it to investigate the causes of song learning evolution.","U.S. scientists studied 723 male chaffinches in twelve different populations across the European mainland, the Azores and the Canaries .

Emaciated and barely able to walk, this is appalling condition a helpless dog was found in after he escaped from the home of his feckless master. Crumb, the frail bull terrier, weighed only two stone and was suffering from an eye infection when he was rescued by a passerby as he scavenged for scraps near a burger van. The muscles in the 11-year-old's back legs were so wasted by neglect they couldn’t even support him properly and he was taken to a Destitute Animal Shelter in Bolton, Greater Manchester. Crumb the Staffordshire bull terrier weighed just over two stone when he was found wandering near a burger van . Appalling condition: The muscles in Crumbs back legs were so wasted they couldn't even support him properly . But after being fed properly for the first time in four months, Crumb put on almost a stone. However, vets could not save his sight and were forced to remove his infected left eye. Despite their care, Crumb died after succumbing to old age. Crumb's cruel master jobless Joseph Moran, 37, of Bolton, was traced after he turned up at the animal shelter to 'reclaim his pet.' At Bolton magistrates court he pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and failing to ensure its welfare. He was disqualified from keeping animals . for three years, ordered to pay £200 costs from his benefits payments . and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. Drastic measures: Vets could not save his sight and were forced to remove his infected left eye. Later he would die of old age . An RSPCA inspector who helped Crumb said it was one of the worst cases of animal neglect he had ever seen . The court heard Moran had been looking after the dog for around six months when a passerby found Crumb found wandering the streets near the burger van in Little Lever on May 2. The pet weighed just 13.8kg - just over two stone - when he should have been 20kg. After examination from a vet, it was confirmed Crumb’s eye had been untreated for around six months, and he hadn’t been fed properly for three to four months. Joseph Moran was disqualified from keeping animals for three years, ordered to pay £200 costs from his benefits payments and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work . The long-standing eye infection was so severe that the eye had to be removed. Had Crumb been presented for veterinary treatment earlier it could easily have been treated, the RSPCA said. An RSPCA inspector said it was one of the worst cases of animal neglect he had ever seen. Prosecutor Tony Walsh told the hearing: 'Moran said he noticed the eye was bad and took the dog to the vets. 'He claimed the vet said putting hot water on the eye should be fine, so he began doing that and tried to treat the dog himself. 'He hasn’t offered an explanation as to the malnutrition of the dog. As soon as the dog was fed properly it began to gain weight.' Defending Moran, Mohammed Patel said his client believed Crumb had swallowed a ball and that was causing him to lose weight. He said Moran had taken the animal to see a vet but could not afford the fees and ‘thought the dog would just get better’. He added: 'He wasn’t aware as to how much it had deteriorated over time. He does feel for Crumb and has co-operated fully with the RSPCA.' Moran was planning to borrow money to have him treated when he went missing. Since the RSPCA took up the case against Moran, the charity is estimated to have spent £3,300 in vets fees, legal fees and kennels. Sentencing Moran District Judge Jonathan Feinstein told Moran: 'It’s quite apparent this dog was seriously neglected by you. 'Those people who have possession of dogs must understand it comes with a serious responsibility. Ordering him to complete community work the judge added: 'During that time you will do something good for society rather than what you have done in the past with this animal. 'There are no excuses for the way you looked after this dog and you should be ashamed of yourself. If this happens again you will go to prison.' After the case RSPCA Inspector Ben Strangwood said: 'Crumb was in one of the poorest states of malnourishment I have ever seen. 'He had a lovely personality and it was so sad when he eventually died - but he was also an old dog. 'We’ll take it as a positive outcome that Moran can’t keep animals for three years.'","Frail bull terrier weighed two stone and was suffering from an eye infection .

Jailed: Former Scout leader Ian Pain, who raped a child and shared indecent images of children with other paedophiles has been jailed for 16 years . A Scout leader who raped a 10-year-old and had thousands of child porn images stored on his computer has been jailed for 16 years. Ian Pain, 48, had initially thanked police for arresting him in June last year after they found more than 3,800 photographs of children aged between seven and 16 being sexually abused on his computer. He claimed that he 'hadn't hurt anybody' and that police action would prevent his urge to look at images of underage porn. But six months later, a 10-year-old boy told one of his friends that he had been abused by Pain, who also refereed youth football matches, over a two year period. He was jailed at Wolverhampton Crown Court this week after admitting his crimes which included inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, distributing indecent images of children and possessing indecent images of children. Pain will also have to sign the sex offenders' register for life and is banned from ever working with, living with or communicating with children again. The court heard that computers, mobile phones and other items were seized during a police raid on Pain's home in Wolverhampton - where he still lived with his parents. Detectives found Pain had 68 level five images, the most extreme in an international evidential scale used by police. Officers also found that 1,305 photographs and films had also been distributed via chat rooms and file sharing websites regularly used by paedophiles. Pain was suspended from his leader's role at the Scouts, refereeing junior football matches and serving as an outwards bounds instructor as the investigation continued. Following Pain's sentencing, Detective Constable Allan Sharp, from West Midlands Police, said: 'When questioned Pain described the dark and sickening online world in which he operated. 'He said that people like him who were viewing indecent images of children were encouraged to share photographs and films depicting abuse. Police raid: Detectives pictured searching through Ian Pain's belongings after raiding his Wolverhampton home in June last year . 'If not, they would be removed from ""friend lists"" and eventually kicked out of the virtual group. 'Many of the sites he used were originally set up to allow people to share music and film. Over the years many of these have been hijacked by people like Pain. Evidence: Detectives found several thousand indecent images on Pain's computer, pictured . 'The crimes his victim described were truly horrendous. One can only imagine the immense burden the child had to bear alone and how that has negatively affected him. 'Up until the last minute, Ian Pain had denied abusing any child. It was only when he realised the consequences of maintaining his web of lies that he finally entered a guilty plea. 'I am satisfied with the lengthy sentence handed down by the courts. 'It reflects the seriousness of his offending and flies in the face of those people like Pain who believe that they are not harming children who feature in these images. 'To capture these acts real children have been subject to sickening abuse and emotionally damaged.' Andy Barker, from the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), added: 'The sentence of Ian Pain to 16 years imprisonment for this horrendous crime also highlights the risk posed to children by those who view indecent images of children. 'We know there are links between viewing such images and the contact abuse of children, which is why we continue to work alongside our police and industry colleagues to provide an increasingly hostile online environment for those who seek out child abuse images.'","Ian Pain, 48, from Wolverhampton initially thanked police for arresting him .

"By . Jack Doyle . PUBLISHED: . 18:58 EST, 2 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:37 EST, 3 October 2013 . One of the country’s most senior judges has praised the Daily Mail for exposing the secret jailing of a woman for trying to take her father out of a care home. In April, the Mail exclusively revealed that 50-year-old Wanda Maddocks had been sentenced to five months in jail by the Court of Protection – the secretive court that controls the affairs of those who are too ill to make their own decisions. Lord Neuberger, the president of the Supreme Court, ‘applauded’ the reporting of the case. He said it had resulted in increased openness in the courts which he welcomed ‘without reservation’. Praise: Lord Neuberger, left, praised the Mail for exposing the case of Wanda Maddocks, right, who was jailed for trying take her father out of a care home . Exposure: The Mail's headline when it exclusively ran Miss Maddocks's story . He also praised the Press more widely for its campaigns for more transparency in the justice system. The Mail highlighted Miss Maddocks’ shock when police arrived at her father John’s care home to ‘cart her off to jail’. She had been sentenced in secret for disobeying court orders by trying to remove him from the home where the family thought his life was in danger. She had not been present in court and was not represented by a lawyer when the judgment was made. The case – which was not made public for months – led to a furious row over justice carried out behind closed doors in the Court of Protection. Miss Maddocks served six weeks in Foston Hall – the women’s jail in Derbyshire which was home to Maxine Carr, girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley. Caring: Miss Maddocks was arrested at the care home of her father John, pictured . Lord Neuberger said: ‘I think that one of the important functions of an open society is that the Press and media remind us sometimes of the need to examine our practices and to see whether we do comply as much as we should with the need for open justice. ‘And I think some of the campaigns – while not always well conceived or entirely right in all respects – for improving open justice in the courts are to be applauded.’ Asked about the case of Miss Maddocks, he said that anything that supports openness in terms of hearings was to be applauded, while the need for secrecy had to be justified in every case. ‘The short answer is if you are saying that this case has resulted – which it has done – in increased openness then one welcomes it without reservation,’ he said. Miss Maddocks was not in court – and not represented by a lawyer – when a judge ruled that her attempt to remove her 80-year-old father from the home amounted to wilful defiance of the court and ordered her to be jailed. But no record of the judgment was published and secrecy rules barred the naming of Miss Maddocks, her father, the council that brought the case and the social worker who gave evidence against her. Judge Martin Cardinal, sitting in Birmingham last August, opened his court to the public for sentencing, but the unlocking of the courtroom doors was announced only to passers-by in the corridor outside. Happier times: John Maddocks pictured with his daughter Wanda on a family holiday in Turkey . The Mail’s reporting of the case prompted senior judges to ban the secret jailing of defendants for contempt of court. Lord Neuberger also talked more generally about the need to avoid courts operating in closed session. Last year the Mail campaigned against an extension of secret courts in civil hearings, which resulted in the Government’s proposals being watered down significantly. Speaking yesterday at the start of the legal year, Lord Neuberger said: ‘We should try to minimise the extent of when it is necessary to go in to closed session and do everything we can to ensure that the consequences of going in to closed session are mitigated.’ When Miss Maddocks’ case became public, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling wrote to Sir James Munby, the judge in charge of family justice, asking him to include the Court of Protection in a review of the family courts – which are rarely  open to the public and usually publish only anonymous details of judgments. Miss Maddocks was jailed after the court heard she had repeatedly broken orders not to interfere with her father’s life at the care home. Her family said Mr Maddocks, a retired painter and decorator from Stoke-on-Trent, had been held ‘like a prisoner’ on the orders of a local council. He has since died. The judge said Miss Maddocks  had ‘the attitude of someone who is simply not going to obey court orders’. She was arrested 11 days after her sentencing by police and court officials and served six weeks before being released after apologising to the judge. It was only when the Mail learned of the case that the judge agreed that Miss Maddocks and her brother Ivan could be named, along with  the council, Stoke-on-Trent. He was given a suspended sentence for his role in taking their father to a court hearing and to see a Birmingham lawyer. The judgment in which the sentence was handed down was also published for the first time. Lord Neuberger repeated his criticisms of proposed cuts to legal aid and stated his opposition to new limits on judicial review applications.","Lord Neuberger 'applauded' Mail's coverage of Wanda Maddocks's jailing .

Emergency services were called to the flat Mr McAdam, 53, shares with his partner Lynn, 49, after the street was showered with debris from the explosion. Explosion: A homeowner had to be rushed to hospital after an airbed exploded and blew a hole in his roof . Debris: The airbed exploded with such force neighbours feared there had been a gas blast . Mr McAdam had been inflating an airbed when it exploded at the home in Alexandria, West Dunbartonshire, Scotland, yesterday. It is believed the blast was caused by a fault with the bed’s built-in compressor. Neighbour Wendy Morrison, 41, who lives in the ground floor flat below, said: 'It was utter chaos. 'All of a sudden there was a massive explosion. The whole building shook and they felt it 100 yards further down the road. 'There were a couple of bangs after that.

NBA great Bob Cousy has opened up about his beloved wife Missie's heart-breaking dementia and how he went to enormous lengths to allow the woman he called 'my bride' to believe she was healthy until the end. Cousy, 85, who led the Celtics to six World Championships, said he never felt defeated by the challenge of caring for his high school sweetheart without seeking help, services or sympathy as she slowly succumbed to the ravaging disease. And a week after her death, though bereft and inconsolable, he has described his bounding love for the woman who bristled at the suggestion she was suffering dementia, and the tear-jerking 'game plan' he followed - from shipping her car to their vacation home and doing all the household chores - that allowed her to believe, in her own mind, she wasn't sick. Great love: NBA great Bob Cousy, pictured in 2006, has opened up about his beloved wife Missie's heart-breaking dementia and the enormous lengths he went to to allow the woman he called 'my bride' to believe she was healthy until the end . 'My dad provided an environment that allowed her, in her mind, to be a fully functioning adult,' the couple's daughter Marie told The Worchester Telegram & Gazette as she sat by her father's side on Thursday. 'It was amazing to watch.' Cousy married the raven-haired Marie Ritterbusch 63 years ago - six months after he graduated from the College of the Holy Cross having helped his team win an NCAA championship. He spent his wedding night playing point guard for the Celtics, which set the scene for how the early part of their marriage would unfold. 'I was busy playing a child's game,' Cousy said. 'I thought putting a ball in a hole was important. Looking back, I should have participated more in the lives of my family. But my girls were in the best possible loving hands.' However, tearing up, he described how the couple's romance flourished as they grew older. 'Our marriage was somewhat contrary . to tradition,' he said. 'Most couples have the most intensity in the . beginning. But I was always working. So we had the best and most . romantic part of our marriage at the end. We literally held hands for . the last 20 years.' Roles reversed: Missie, pictured left bringing a drink to her injured husband in 1957, was cared for by Cousy for the past decade as her condition worsened . Side by side: Bob Cousy, top left and wife Missie, right, applaud during a Milwaukee Bucks-Boston Celtics championship game in 1974 . Cousey is pictured here with daughters, Ticia Cousy, left, and Marie Cousy during an interview at the family's Worcester home last Thursday . Missie began her cognitive decline a dozen years ago, Cousy told the newspaper. She would ask him the same questions repeatedly and grew disoriented, struggling with balance. But she always knew her husband, and the fiercely independent woman, who was used to running a household with her husband gone for weeks at a time, refused to believe she was suffering from dementia. So, used to 'game plans,' Cousy worked hard to create the perception that his bride was still her old self. He had her station wagon shipped to their place in Florida in the winter because she thought she could still drive. He planted artificial flowers in the garden and did all the chores, telling her she'd done them herself. When her condition worsened, the couple stopped socializing and apart from the occasional 'night out with the boys' or game of golf, he spent all his time alone with his sweetheart, patiently answering her questions and ensuring she had everything she needed. 'It drew us closer together,' he told . the newspaper. 'It was never a chore, because I knew she would have . done the same for me. You just have to go with the flow. Every three . months, I'd scream out something just for release.' Sports lover: Cousy, pictured left in 2007, and right in 1950, was always a sports love and spent weeks away from his family while playing . Legend on and off the court: Cousy, 14, brings the ball past a New York Knickerbockers defender during a game at Madison Square Garden in New York, March 3, 1963 during his last appearance in New York as a professional basketball player . Each morning, Cousy would wake first and arrange Missie's pills, the newspaper, a fiber bar and a banana on the kitchen table before rousing her. She would take two or three hours to get through the paper, he said, because she liked to underline every line with a black pen. He explained how, after a while, he found comfort in reading between the lines because it was something they shared. 'She was leading a happy life,' he said. 'It was part of the game plan.' The routine continued for years. But on September 7, when Cousy took his wife for an early dinner at Worcester Country Club and on the drive home she suffered a severe stroke. She died peacefully two weeks later. Now, he no longer puts her pills out in the morning or reads between the lines. But, as he did for decades before, he still tells his wife he loves her before bed each night. It's hard to entirely give up the game plan.","Cousy, who led the Celtics to six World Championships, said he never felt defeated by the challenge of caring for his wife of 63 years, Missie .

One of Britain’s most controversial and worst-performing rail firms has been granted a 23-month extension to its franchise by the Government. Passengers have been promised improvements after the Government said First Great Western – dubbed ‘Worst Late Western’ by critics’ over poor punctuality and chronic overcrowding - will carry on running line until September 2015 before bidding starts for a new long-term franchise. Critics said the extension was ‘a scandal’ and smacked of ‘rewards for failure on a massive scale.’ Controversial: The operator dubbed 'Worst Late Western' has been granted a franchise extension . The Great Western main line runs from London's Paddington station out to the Cotswolds, South Wales and south-west England. But Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: ‘First Great Western are being rewarded for failure on a massive scale. They have increased walk-on fares by 210 per cent  since privatisation, three times faster than the rate of inflation. ‘They are also the first rail firm to provoke a strike by passengers in the entire history of the railways, in protest at overcrowding in the Bristol region.’ RMT transport union leader Bob Crow said: ‘This is another twist of the rail franchising racket with a company running one of the worst-performing services in the country given a free run to milk this vital inter-city line for all it is worth for another two years. ‘We are demanding to know . just how much First extracted from the Government in last-ditch talks . where they had bullied themselves into a monopoly provider position. ‘It . is a scandal that the publicly-run option was never considered for this . franchise even though it would have saved the taxpayer a fortune.’ Fierce criticism: TSSA rail union leader Manuel Cortes (left) said the deal had 'rewarded failure', while RMT transport union chief Bob Crow (right) described the franchising system as a 'racket' But ministers and rail bosses insisted there would be improvements’ including greater wi-fi coverage and additional sleep carriages. In August furious First Great Western passengers  vented their rage after enduring ‘third world cattle truck ’ conditions’  and a 12 hour nightmare journey  when an overcrowded and ageing train belonging to First Great Western  suffered brake-failure. They accused the firm of ’incompetence’ after nearly 500 passengers were left stranded, thirsty and hungry  for almost six hours near Pewsey, Wiltshire, on the 30-year-old broken down train from Penzance to London Paddington. Passengers described the fiasco as ‘horrific’ and a ‘chaotic disaster’ and said they were ‘treated like cattle’. Those  seeking to slake their thirst were outraged to be charged for hot drinks, said witnesses. In July a damning new Government league-table of cattle-class services, identified a First Great Western service as officially the most overcrowded service in England and Wales. It showed that in  Spring 2012,  the 07.44 First Great Western service  from Henley in Berkshire into Paddington in West London  carried 415 tightly-packed passengers in three carriages  designed to carry 225 people in Standard Class. That meant there were 190 passengers ‘in excess of capacity’ and that the train was 84 per cent overcrowded. This was worse than the previous check in Spring 2011 when the same service was 80 per cent overcrowded. Overall, First Great Western  also had the highest level of passengers ‘in excess of capacity’  of any London and south east England operator in 2012 at 7.1 per cent  across both peaks. On track: Transport secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the deal proved the new arrangement worked . Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the franchise extention was further proof that the Government's new franchising schedule is on track: ‘The Great Western franchise provides a vital service for thousands of passengers every day and under this deal they will see real benefits. ‘This agreement will provide additional sleeper carriages between London and Cornwall securing the future of a key service once under threat.’ Mr McLoughlin added:  ‘We have also secured a commitment to deliver greater wi-fi coverage to improve the experience of long-distance journeys for passengers. ‘But I am also determined that we see further improvements during the lifetime of this contract; more standard class and fewer first class seats on key services and the delivery of more electric trains for the Thames Valley.’ First Great Western (FGW) is the rail-arm of transport giant First Group, whose  initially successful bid to run the West Coast Mainline was then overturned following a challenge by Sir Richard Branson. First Group’s chief executive Tim O’Toole also heads the Government’s ‘Rail Delivery Group’ set up by ministers to IMPROVE services. Mr O'Toole said: ‘Today's agreement is good news for FGW passengers, taxpayers and our shareholders as it provides continuity and consistency, building on the improvements our experienced team has already made over the last franchise period. 'We have seen significant improvements in customer satisfaction and punctuality, and working with the Department for Transport we have delivered additional capacity on the busiest morning peak trains. ‘We will work closely with stakeholders and partners along the route to explore further ways to support our local communities.’ Anthony Smith, chief executive of rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, said: ‘We know that, for most passengers, the key thing is that trains keep running, turn up on time, and that they are able to get a seat. ’It is important that this short-term extension is used to prepare and deliver a better, more passenger-focused franchise where the passenger voice has been heard and taken into account.’","'Failing' train operator award extension until September 2015 .

A respected cancer specialist killed a 21-year-old cyclist who was on a bike ride with her boyfriend while driving on the bend of a road, a jury heard today. Dr Helen Measures told the jury how she overtook two cyclists in her red Mini only to drive into the path of two more riders coming from the opposite direction. She collided with waitress Denisa Perinova, who was out on a bike ride with her new boyfriend. Cyclist Denisa Perinova (left) died after colliding with the car of Dr Helen Measures (right), a jury heard . Miss Perinova, originally from the Czech Republic, allegedly lost control of her £300 second-hand bike, which was bought for her by her boyfriend, Ben Pontin, just four days before. She was flung 15 yards from the seat of her new racing bike and, despite wearing a helmet, died in hospital from severe head injuries a week later, the Oxford Crown Court jury was told. Measures, who has a doctorate in oncology and has worked as a scientist for leading pharmaceutical companies for the past 30 years, has denied causing Miss Perinova’s death by careless driving. A keen cyclist herself, she told the court: 'I can’t help it if a cyclist, with all due respect, falls over as I’m approaching them and comes into my line of travel.' The 51-year-old divorced mother-of-four said she was travelling back from a garden centre to her home in Pishill, near Henley-on-Thames, at 40-50mph on July 15 last year. She was with her four-year-old daughter and her long-term boyfriend. The former parish church bell ringer said she had not seen the cyclists coming from the other direction when she overtook, and thought there was 'sufficient room' to make the manoeuvre. Measures said she was 'surprised' to see Mr Pontin and his girlfriend coming towards her as she rounded the curve in the road - but felt they still had enough room to get past. 'I don’t know why I didn’t see them,' she said. 'I had to make a decision of what to do. I felt the safest decision was to continue straight ahead because they were in single file. 'If I had been concerned, I would have stopped suddenly.' Mr Pontin had earlier told the jury he saw Measures make a 'stupid manoeuvre' in front of them on a bend in the A415. Describing the moment the oncoming car overtook the cyclists on the opposite side of the road, he said: 'I just couldn’t believe the person driving had overtaken at that point.' Miss Perinova, shown here with her parents and younger brother, died after the collision in July 2012 . Mr Pontin said he was forced to aim for a 'tiny' gap and then felt his girlfriend’s wheel touch the back of his bike before looking around and seeing she had been flung 15 yards away in the collision. Her body lay motionless at the entrance to a field. Her helmet was smashed, and Mr Pontin said it was unclear whether she had been struck by the defendant’s Mini. Miss Perinova was initially rushed to the Royal Berkshire Hospital, in Reading, before being transferred to a specialist neurological unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where she later died. Taking to the stand, Measures, who has previously been on family cycling holidays, said she did not have a chance to break. She said the first cyclist, Mr Pontin, went past her. However, Miss Perinova came at her at 'right angles' after losing control of her bike. In a heated exchange at Oxford Crown Court, Measures was challenged by prosecutor Sandra Beck, who said: 'You are relying on other road users avoiding you when you are on their side of the road?' Measures replied: 'I can’t help it if a cyclist, with all due respect, falls over as I’m approaching them and comes into my line of travel. 'I would expect cyclists to generally remain upright as the first cyclist did and went past. 'When I looked, it was sufficiently clear not to stop me doing that manoeuvre. 'You do not make a manoeuvre if you don’t think it is safe to do so. 'Had everyone stayed upright, there would not have been an issue. 'I had my daughter in the car. I do not drive without due care and attention.' The trial, before Judge Patrick Eccles, continues.

A 26-year-old woman from Tampa Bay, Florida, is battling cancer at the same time as she is coping with her first pregnancy. Ashley Gayle-Boothe was told the joyous news that she was expecting back in March. It was particularly unexpected news as doctors had previously told her that she wouldn't be able to conceive because she had endometriosis. Ashley Gayle-Boothe, 26, from Tampa Bay, Florida, discovered a cancerous lump on her breast just two weeks after being told that she was pregnant . But two weeks later she made another unexpected discovery while applying stretch mark cream to her body. ‘I was just putting the lotion on to prevent stretch marks and stuff and I had felt the lump in my left breast,’ she told ABC ActionNews. A biopsy revealed she had cancer in her left breast, muscle and lymph nodes. Ashley’s treatment has so far involved a mastectomy and chemotherapy, which she only agreed to after being reassured that it wouldn't affect her baby. Ashley will be induced eight weeks early on October 4 to give both her and her son a better shot at avoiding complications . A biopsy revealed Ashley had cancer in her left breast, muscle and lymph nodes . Ashley faces further surgery and chemotherapy, but is looking forward to watching her son grow . ‘Because it didn't pass through the placenta and because the baby's spinal cord and all that was closed,’ she explained. The cancer means Ashley will be induced eight weeks early on October 4, in order to give both her and the baby son she is expecting a better shot at avoiding complications. In preparation for the early birth, doctors have been injecting steroids into the baby's lungs to make them stronger so he can breathe on his own. 'I just want him to be okay.

Beanie Babies creator Ty Warner has pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion after failing to report income earned in a secret offshore bank account. The businessman behind the stuffed toy animal craze in the 1990s has already agreed to pay a penalty of more than $53 million. He apologized in a choked-up voice for hiding millions of dollars in a Swiss bank account. Cry baby: Beanie Babies founder Ty Warner apologized in a choked-up voice at a courtroom in Chicago and told a federal judge he had known his tax forms weren't accurate . Charges: Ty Warner, the man behind the Beanie Baby craze, allegedly failed to report income in an offshore bank account . Mr Warner, who lives in suburban Chicago and is the sole owner of TY Inc., still faces the prospect of time behind bars. A conviction on a federal tax evasion charge carries a maximum five-year  sentence. 'When I signed those returns, I knew those moneys were missing,' Warner said. 'It was not accurate. I apologize for my conduct. It's a terrible way to meet you,' Warner told the judge. Struggling to keep his composure, Warner rubbed the back of his neck as he spoke and also said he had much to be thankful for. In court, Warner acknowledged that he told no one of his foreign bank accounts, not even his accountants. Big softy: Beanie Babies founder Ty Warner is escorted from the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse in Chicago, Illinois . Warner even concealed his name from one account by registering it as 'Molani Foundation,' a 'sham company,' prosecutors said in court. Prosecutors say he failed to report $24.4 million in income from 1999 to 2007 and failed to pay taxes of about $5.6 million. He faces up to five years in prison for one count of tax evasion. Sentencing guidelines call for prison time of 46 to 57 months, according to Warner's 18-page plea agreement. Taxpayers must report financial accounts in foreign countries if their value exceeds $10,000. Such penalties can equal up to 50 percent of the amount in the account. The account had as much as $107 million at one time, it was disclosed . The 69-year-old, said by Forbes to have a $2.6 billion net worth, was behind the Beanie Babies craze that made the company hundreds of millions of dollars in the mid-90s. He ranks 209th in a recent Forbes list of the richest Americans. The small, plush toys come in various animal forms with heart-shaped name tags and were considered valuable collectors' items. His most valuable investment however, is said to be New York's Four Seasons Hotel. He turned down a $900 million offer to buy it in November last year. Mr Warner maintained a secret offshore account starting in 1996 with the Switzerland-based financial services company, UBS. His attorney, Gregory Scandaglia, said Mr Warner accepts full responsibility. 'This is an unfortunate situation that Mr Warner has been trying to resolve for several years now,' Mr Scandaglia said. According to prosecutors, Mr Warner earned $3.1 million in gross income in 2002 through investments held in the UBS account. Soft touch: Ty Warner hiding $25 million in income in secret Swiss bank accounts. The toy-maker's 18-page plea deal says guidelines call for a prison term of around four years. He is also going to have to pay a $53 million fine . Income: Ty Warner has agreed to pay a penalty and will plead guilty, his attorney says . He committed tax evasion by failing to inform his accountants about that income. By leaving out his UBS income, he falsely reported that his total income in 2002 was $49 million, prosecutors said. 'Regardless of wealth, everyone must pay taxes on all of their income, not just the amount they choose to report,' Gary S. Shapiro, the acting U.S. attorney in Chicago. He will be sentenced on January 15th, 2014.","Ty Warner failed to report income in an offshore bank account .

The Massachusetts hero who had his boat seized in April after finding the Boston bombing suspect hiding inside will has bought a new vessel with the help of donors across America. David Henneberry became a national figure after finding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev inside his 22-foot Seahawk on April 19 and a crowdfunding campaign quickly began to brim with donations thereafter in an effort to raise $50,000 so the Watertown man could buy himself a new boat. That goal was met and then some. Now, Henneberry has purchased a used vessel he modestly calls a 'fixer-upper' and plans to give the money left over to charity. Overwhelmed: David Henneberry calmly called 911 after finding Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in his boat. He was quickly dubbed a hero, but the FBI quickly carted his beloved boat away . 'We just recently, two weeks ago, got a used boat,' Henneberry told ABCNews.com. 'We did accept [the $50,000] and we did also request that anything over that went to the One Fund. It just seemed right to do.' The One Fund is a charity put in place to help victims of the savage April 15 attack and their families. The crowdsourced funds came from a site called Crowdtilt. Craig Dunlap dubbed the campaign 'Let's Fix David Henneberry's Boat (That Got Ruined in the Boston Bomber's Standoff)!' But that's not precisely how it happened. Sighted: Tsarnaev rises from Henneberry's boat with a laser sight on his forehead at the time of his capture . Sinking feeling: The suspected terrorist engaged authorities in a shootout that left the boat, dubbed Slip Away, riddled with holes . Generous: A campaign to replace Henneberry's boat quickly popped up on Crowdtilt.com. Just days after the campaign began, it had received $50,597.50 . 'It was actually taken by the FBI, but that's another thing,' he said. Donations began to flood in within days after Tsarnaev's capture, as did postcards and letters of thanks, which Henneberry found extremely touching. 'You just want to ramble on you feel so grateful,' Henneberry told ABC. 'After such a bad thing happened to us and the people of Boston, it was wonderful to see that. It was humbling.' By April 30, the fund exceeded its goal. Thanks to a large donation from the Boston Whaler boat company, Henneberry received exactly $50,597. 'It restores your faith in people,' he said. 'They don't know me.' Henneberry named his new boat after his wife, dubbing it Beth Said Yes. His old boat was called Slip Away. 'That's fitting, isn't it?' he laugh. 'We decided we're just going to let Slip Away slip away.' History: Henneberry said that he saw a 'good amount' of blood in the cabin, and then a body. He calmly called 911 and the rest is history...along with the boat . Tsarnaev emerges wounded, bloody, and dazed from the boat. Now that Slip Away has slipped away, Henneberry has purchased a used boat he calls Beth Said Yes .","David Henneberry was hailed a hero after 'calmly' calling 911 when he found Dzhokhar Tsarnaev inside his 22-foot Sea Hawk cruiser in April 19 .

A Manhattan business executive is facing a sexual harassment lawsuit after his former receptionist accused him of fondling her breasts and forcing her to accompany him to the restroom. The suit filed by Sherina Thomas, 28, seeks unspecified damages from the defendant, 41-year-old David Shavolian who heads the company Executive Offices New York City offering high-end business suites for rent. According to court filings made public this week, Miss Thomas, who is engaged to be married with  two young kids, first met Shavolian last year when she answered an ad placed by Executive Offices seeking child models. Plaintiff: Sherina Thomas, 28, (pictured) filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against her former employer, Manhattan real estate executive David Shavolian . Thomas, a mother of two, had spent a year working for Executive Offices New York City, during which time she claims her boss offered her money for oral sex and forced her to accompany him to the men's room . However, when the woman arrived at the company’s headquarters on Seventh Avenue, Shavolian allegedly started making sexual advances at her. The lawsuit cited by the New York Daily News states that the 41-year-old businessman offered Thomas to help launch her own modeling career. He then allegedly forced her to show him her bare breasts, which he then proceeded to fondle before declaring that they were 'not firm enough.' After that first encounter, Mr Shavolian called Thomas and offered her a job as a receptionist in his company. The mother of two, who was unemployed at the time, came in for an interview, which has been described in court filings as anything but typical. According to the suit, at one point Shavolian inquired of Thomas, 'do you shave or wax?' Close encounter: Thomas' lawsuit states that the first time she met Shavolian, he forced her to show him her bear breasts, fondled them and them declared they are not firm enough . Despite the apparent red flags, the cash-strapped Thomas decided to take the job in May 2012. A promotion to a managerial position soon followed, but her rapid career growth was accompanied by some unconventional job requirements, among them shadowing her boss wherever he went - even to the men's room. The lawsuit claims the high-powered executive also propositioned his employee, even offering her $1,200 for oral sex. After working for Shavolian for a year, Thomas resigned this past May.","Sherina Thomas, 28, seeks unspecified damages from Executive Offices New York executive David Shavolian .

The Idaho aerospace executive accused of slapping a toddler on a Delta Airlines flight earlier this year changed his plea to guilty yesterday. Joe Rickey Hundley, 60, agreed in an Atlanta court yesterday to a deal with prosecutors that will see him spend up to six months in a prison, instead of the one-year term he faced if he had gone to trial and lost. Speaking in court, Hundley, acknowledged that his alcoholism may have contributed to his outburst in February during which he struck 19-month old Jonah Bennett and hurled a racial slur at him too. Admission of guilt: Joe Rickey Hundley, 60 . (left), entered a guilty plea in connection to the February . incident in which he allegedly assaulted 19-month old Jonah Bennett . (right) after he started crying on a flight . Victim: Jonah Bennett's mother says that the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears' as the plane began to land . 'I discussed the issues over grief … in AA meetings I’ve been going to since February,' Hundley said when U.S. Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman asked whether he’d been to counseling since the incident according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. His attorney, Marcia Shein added that he changed his plea yesterday because he 'couldn't take it anymore'. She said that Hundley had been awake for 24 hours straight because he was traveling to see his son, who was dying because he had taken an intentional overdose of insulin. 'He lost a child,' she said of the elder Hundley. 'And to hear a child scream … he lost it. He was up for 24 hours determining whether to unplug his son.' 'Certainly, he’d had at least one cocktail and he lost his cool,' she said. 'He shouldn’t have, obviously, and that’s what he’s paying the price for.' Hundley, who lived in Idaho at the time, was on a Delta flight from Minneapolis to Atlanta on Feb. 8 and was seated in a window seat next to Jessica Bennett, who was sitting in the aisle seat and had her 19-month-old adopted black son on her lap, according to court filings. Speaking out: Jessica Bennett, pictured with her husband, was shocked when she said Joe Rickey Hundley demanded that she 'shut that n****r baby up' At the beginning of the flight, Hundley pressed the call button and asked a flight attendant about the airline's policy regarding 'lap children,' prosecutors said in a filing. The way he asked the question made it clear he was unhappy about the child's presence, prosecutors wrote. As the plane descended into Atlanta, the child started crying. Hundley, who is white, leaned over to Bennett and 'told her to shut that n***** baby up,' according to a sworn statement from an FBI agent who investigated the incident. Bennett asked Hundley what he had said, and he leaned in with his face up next to hers and said it again, prosecutors said in a filing. Hundley then slapped the child in the face, leaving a scratch below his right eye, the FBI agent's statement says. Mr Hundley has since moved to North Carolina after being fired amid widespread outrage. In March, Hundley entered a not guilty plea and was released from jail on $10,000 bond. The 60-year-old now faces a year in prison and a fine of up to $100,000. Hundley's . attorney said earlier this year that her client was on his way to take . his son off life support after being told just 24 hours earlier that he . had overdosed on insulin, and was 'upset and grieving' at the time of . the incident. Trauma: Mrs Bennett says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has since become 'apprehensive to strangers' Hundley's son was 'in a coma for . life,' attorney Marcia Shein said in a statement. 'On the flight, he was . in distress, upset and grieving,' she said. The boy's mother, Jessica Bennett, of . Minneapolis who is white, was seated with her adopted black son, Jonah, . when she says Hundley struck her child after using a racial slur . directed at them. 'Shut that . n****r baby up,' he allegedly told the mother while their Delta was descending from Minneapolis into Atlanta. Shein . said he did use a racial slur when the child started crying because of . ear pressure, but she denied that Hundley struck the boy. In media interviews, the child's mother has said Hundley was belligerent and seemed intoxicated during the flight. 'I said, ""What did you just say?"" And . he was so drunk that he fell onto my face and his mouth moved over to . my ear and he said it directly into my ear,' She told ABC News. It was then she said that Hundley lifted and . swung his hand at her child. Outrage: Mrs Bennett, pictured with Jonah, said that Hundley also informed her that her child was too big to be a 'lap baby' 'When I looked at Jonah’s face, his eye was swollen... and it was bleeding. I was just scared to death,' she said. She says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has become 'apprehensive to strangers' since. Hundley . was fired from his executive position at AGC Aerospace & Defense in the aftermath of the media firestorm spark by the altercation, his attorney said. The . Oklahoma City-based military technology company issued a statement . describing the executive's behavior as 'offensive and disturbing.' Lawyers for Hundley had said in court filings that the amount of . media coverage his case received was highly unusual for a misdemeanor . charge and added that 'it is impossible to avoid the reality that the . national media has painted Mr. Hundley as a villain.' Hundley's son, whose age was not given, died the day after the flight, Shein said. Fired: Hundley was an executive at AGC Aerospace & Defense before he was fired after the incident for what his company called disturbing allegations . Hundley 'has paid a terrible price for his hurtful words,' his lawyer said. The 60-year-old previously also denied using racial language, claiming he did 'ask the mother to quiet the child.' Hundley previously said he was traveling to Atlanta to visit a . hospitalized relative, described his emotional state as 'distraught' and that he had one alcoholic drink on the aircraft. However, . Bennett told The Smoking Gun that she believed Hundley was intoxicated. The mother said that he 'reeked of alcohol', was 'stumbling around . wasted' and he consumed several double vodkas during the flight. Bennett said Hundley told her that Jonah was too big to be a 'lap baby.' Agent Cheney added that Bennett . received help from other passengers on the flight. Todd Wooten, . who was seated 12 rows ahead, told authorities that he 'heard derogatory . language coming from the rear of the aircraft' and went to see what was . going on. 'According to Mr. Wooten,' Cheney wrote, 'he saw Joe Rickey Hundley strike' the child. Hundley pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault in a Virginia court in . 2007 after he was arrested following a fight with his girlfriend.

Automatonophobia is a fear of puppets, ventriloquist dummies, waxworks and animatronic models. It is considered an irrational fear because the objects of terror pose no threat to personal safety. In extreme cases, sufferers can experience a racing heart, breathing difficulties, nausea, diarrhea, shaking, sleeping problems and light sensitivity. Pupaphobia is a strain of automatonophobia that is specially related to the fear of puppets. Mrs Broom, from Swansea, first realised her fear during a holiday in Newquay nearly 20 years ago. 'The shows were never on in our house while I was growing up, so I didn't have much exposure to them,' she said. 'I only realised how badly I was affected when I was on holiday with some friends in Newquay when I was 18. 'I broke down when I spotted a furry Muppet toy in a tourist shop. I was shaking - I just completely freaked out. 'My friends thought it was hilarious, but I was terrified.' She traces the root of her phobia to a 'terrifying' experience when she was five years old. 'I'd . gone with my mum to pick up a second-hand rabbit hutch we'd bought from . a local family', she said. 'Mum went outside with the seller to lift . the hutch into our car, and I was left inside the house, in a dark room, . with an elderly lady. The 37-year-old solicitor, from Swansea, often breaks down when reminded of characters from The Muppets, Sesame Street and Fraggle Rock . 'The elderly woman didn't say a word, but she was obviously unwell. She sat there groaning and wheezing as an episode of The Muppets was playing on the TV. 'It was the strangest and most terrifying experience of my entire life. When mum came back to collect me from the room, I burst into tears. I remember it like it was yesterday.'

Automatonophobia is considered an irrational fear because the objects of terror - such as puppets, ventriloquist dummies, waxworks and animatronic models - pose no threat to personal safety. In extreme cases, sufferers can experience a racing heart, breathing difficulties, nausea, diarrhea, shaking, sleeping problems and light sensitivity. In Mrs Broom's case, the phobia is limited strictly to characters from three popular television shows. She said: 'I'm fine with most puppets. It's only The Muppets, Sesame Street and Fraggle Rock I can't stand. 'A few years ago I visited a theme park in Florida with my nephew. He was desperate to go on a Muppets-themed ride, but I had to run out of the queue.' While there is no known cure for automatonophobia, possible treatments include hypnosis, psychoanalysis therapy and even medication. Mrs Broom said: 'I haven't sought medical advice - the phobia is so specialised that I can't imagine anyone will be able to help me.' Other unusual phobias known to medical science include nomophobia, the fear of being out of mobile phone contact; triskaidekaphobia, the fear of the number 13, and arachibutyrophobia, the fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of the mouth.

"By . Michael Zennie . PUBLISHED: . 22:26 EST, 2 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:33 EST, 2 October 2013 . Just two percent of counties across the country are responsible for more than half of all death row cases and executions, a death penalty research group has revealed. The Death Penalty Information Center argues that the death penalty has never been a nationwide policy - nor even a statewide policy. Instead, it's the province of a few counties, usually because of prosecutors there who aggressively pursue the death penalty. The southern U.S. is responsible for an overwhelming portion of death penalty cases since 1976. Even in the South, most cases come from just a few counties . Disproportionate: Counties like Harris County, Texas, and Los Angeles County, California, file the overwhelming number of death penalty cases . 'The disparate and highly clustered use of the death penalty raises serious questions of unequal and arbitrary application of the law,' the group writes in its reports. 'It also forces the jurisdictions that have resisted the death penalty for decades to pay for a costly legal process that is often marred with injustice.' The Death Penalty Information Center officially has no stance on the death penalty, though critics say the reports the group produces exclusively argue against death penalty laws. Its study found that since the death penalty was re-instated in the U.S. in 1976, just 2percent of counties are responsible for 52 percent of execution and 56 percent of all inmates on death row. Additionally, 85 percent of counties in the U.S. have not had an execution since 1976. Harris County, Texas, - home of Houston - and Dallas County, Texas, - home of Dallas - are the leading two counties in the country for executions since 1976 . The figures are skewed, however, because only 32 states currently have the death penalty. In the last decade, six large states - including New York, Illinois and New Jersey - abolished the death penalty. The report singles out Maricopa County, Arizona - home to Phoenix and Sheriff Joe Arpaio, 'America's toughest sheriff.' Maricopa, which has 88 people on death row, has condemned four times as many people to die - on a per capita basis - as the much larger Los Angeles County, California, or Harris County, Texas. The Death Penalty Information Center claims this is largely because of Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas, who sought the death penalty in 149 cases between 2005 and 2010. Maricopa County, Arizona, has a disproportionate number of inmates on death row compared to its population . Last year, the Arizona Supreme Court unanimously issued a ruling disbarring Thomas over corruption allegations. The allegations didn't especially relate to his prosecution of death penalty cases, but the Death Penalty Information Center said the case proves that one man with an agenda can influence death penalty prosecutions. The Center also pointed a finger at Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, which has 88 people on death row - the ranking third in the country. It pointed out that even though even though the county had by far the highest number of death penalty cases in the state, its public defenders for capital cases were the lowest paid in all of Pennsylvania. The Center says this could be one reason many Philadelphia death sentences are overturned on appeal.","Study from Death Penalty Information Center claims executions are the result of local decisions, because they are clustered in just a few counties .
Since 1976, 85 percent of U.S. counties have not had a single execution .
Maricopa County, Arizona and Philadelphia, Pennsylvanian, have been singled out for having large numbers of death row inmates in proportion to their populations ."

Former Major League Baseball player Chad Curtis was today sentenced to seven-to-15 years in prison for sexually assaulting three young girls after a judge told him: 'You are a threat to any community you get into'. Curtis, 44, was convicted last Friday in a Michigan court room after a week-long trial, during which all three of the girls - two of whom were only 15 at the time of the assault - took the stand and testified about what happened in the weight room of a high school where he was a volunteer coach. Before the judge handed down his sentence today, Curtis gave a long and rambling statement - which lasted more than an hour - in which he denied the assaults, accused the girls of propositioning him and said he led prison inmates at Barry County Jail to Christ. Denial: Curtis gave a long and rambling statement today in which he denied the assaults, accused the girls of propositioning him and said he led prison inmates at Barry County Jail to Christ . Guilty: Former Major Leaguer Chad Curtis has been convicted of sexually assaulting three underage girls and sentenced to seven-to-15 years in prison . As he told the judge he was the one who . told the girls he would not engage in a romantic relationship with them, . his victims stormed out of the courtroom. His 16-year-old victim who testified that he touched her private areas and fondled and kissed her breasts, made a statement prior to sentencing before a packed courtroom that included Curtis’ wife, MLive reports. 'I, myself, kept giving you a chance to walk away from the monster you'd become. As a Christian, I don’t hope for any bad things to happen to you,' she said. 'I hope for good things. I hope you admit what you’ve done to God and yourself.' He hugged his wife and children after the verdict was read. Family support: Curtis hugged his wife (pictured here in the courtroom) and children after the verdict was read . The two-time World Series champion was . set to become the school’s head football coach last fall, but resigned . when the allegations were made public. Despite being described by defense witnesses as a man of ‘high moral character', the Grand Rapids Press reported, the girls’ detailed accounts and no-nonsense testimony did the former Yankees outfielder in. In court today however, the prosecution said: 'He's not a trainer, he's a sexual predator'. During his statement he accused all of his victims of lying and said that one day he would write a book with one of the girls that 'would benefit millions of people', adding, 'the truth will set her free'. Curtis was first accused of inappropriately touching the buttocks of two female students, both 15 at the time of the incidents as recent as April 2012, while he was the volunteer strength and conditioning coach at Lakewood High School. A third student, 16, then came forward and said Curtis touched her private areas and kissed her breasts the previous summer. ‘It appears as if [the victims] left . quite a strong impression with the jury,’ the prosecutor told the Grand . Rapids Press after his conviction last week. ‘They were unequivocal . about what happened to them.’ ‘This . has been such a long road for them,’ Nakfoor-Pratt told the paper, . adding that ‘this is a step in the healing process for them'.

The Yankees win!: Curtis is carried off the field after his game 3-winning home run, the defining moment of his career . The conviction came despite a female massage therapist testifying on the defense’s behalf that she didn’t think it was ‘unusual to massage the area around someone's butt in a full-body massage'. While that may have explained two of the occurrences, the massage therapist didn’t address the third girl’s accusations. ‘It definitely was not therapeutic touching,’ said the prosecutor. Curtis played 10 seasons during his big league career. First coming up with the then-California Angels in 1992. The outfielder then moved on to the Detroit Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and Texas Rangers. He won two World Series rings with the Yankees in 1999 in 2000 – famously hitting a game winning walk-off home run in the 10th inning of game three of the 1999 World Series, his second of the game. Curtis retired from professional baseball in 2001 at the age of 32. The soon-to-be convict was previously athletic director at another school district before being dismissed for reasons unknown, which Curtis explained as differences with the administration. When the allegations were first made public, the devout Christian asked his community to pray that the case ‘would be resolved in a way that is honoring God'.","Chad Curtis was convicted last week of sexually assaulting three girls aged between 15 and 16 .

Cambridge University has long been regarded as one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the world.

Records from the university's Vice-Chancellor's Court, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, show it was a school for scandal. Elite: Cambridge University has long been regarded as one of the most prestigious academic institutions in the world. However, historians have exposed the seedy underbelly of the acclaimed university - with tales of adultery, bribery and even murder . The court, which laid down the law, was called to adjudicate on horrific crimes such as murder and the beating of women until 'blacke and blewe'. Newly-catalogued archives also show frequent claims of men falsely being taunted for being a cuckold - a husband with an adulterous wife - and the birth of illegitimate children. In 1595, William Covell, a fellow of Queens' College, was accused of having an affair with married Bridget Edmunds. The court summoned servants and neighbours as witnesses and Edmunds' maid reported seeing the pair being 'naughte together'. Adjudication: The university's Proctor, who administered justice in the 16th century . Covell was described as 'blusteringe and bloweing verie much and afterwards verie redd in the face' and she 'bare-legged without anie hosen on and havinge her petticate not laced'. Shamed Edmunds eventually confessed that Covell was the father of her unborn child. She was made to give a public acknowledgement of her guilt in St Botolph's church on three successive Sundays - dressed in a white sheet and holding a white staff. Another record from 1603 tells how John Dighton, of St Catharine's Hall, sued the college butler for calling him 'a turd in his teeth' - a common insult of the period. In 1625, Kenelm Mainwairing, of St John's College, and his wife Mary brought a case against Jeremy Chace, of Christ's College, for calling Mary a 'scurvy queane'. Three years earlier, Carrier Thomas Hobson, of Hobson's choice fame, had been sued by a disgruntled employee called Rooke for non-payment of wages. Hobson then alleged Rooke was a thief who had mistreated horses and allowed them to 'gott loose' while he sloped off to an ale house. And he accused him of picking up a girl on the London to Cambridge road who had fallen from the wagon and died. Scandal: Records from the university's Vice-Chancellor Court, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, show it was a school for scandal. The court was called to adjudicate on horrific crimes such as murder and the beating of women until 'blacke and blewe' Rooke was condemned as 'contumacious' and his arrest was ordered four times, but he eluded justice. The historic cases have been publicised for the first time after archivists finished cataloguing the thousands of pages of old university records. University archivist Jacky Cox, who . spent a year on the project, said the issues the court dealt with were . 'deathly serious to the status-conscious society of the time'. Offenders could be imprisoned or subjected to corporal punishment for major crimes, or suspended from their degrees. Insulting: An excerpt from Cambridge University's crime records which shows John Dighton, of St Catharine's Hall, taking legal action against the college butler for calling him 'a turd in his teeth' 'The court records provide a vivid insight into the social and economic history of Cambridge, beyond the academic life of the university, as the inhabitants of this small market town, town alongside gown, lived and died, traded, worshipped, fell out and made up under the auspices of the university authorities,' she said. The Chancellor's Court was presided over by the Vice-Chancellor from the sixteenth century. It accrued wide-ranging civil, criminal and ecclesiastical powers from successive monarchs. The court tried cases affecting university members and other 'privileged persons' - townspeople such as stationers, tailors or butchers trading with university members. For lesser misdemeanoursm students and townsfolk would face fines, bonds for good behaviour or public apology.","Records from the acclaimed university's Vice-Chancellor's Court, dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, show it was a school for scandal .

A man who killed his wife and dumped her body in the Mississippi River has been convicted of her murder. The body of Kira Trevino was found in the frozen river two months after her husband Jeffery brutally killed her in their home in St Paul, Minnesota. Despite police finding the couple’s bedroom covered with blood stains, including a human-shaped mark on the carpet, the jury ruled that Mr Trevino did not intend to kill his 30-year-old wife. Killer: Jeffrey Trevino, 39, brutally murdered his wife Kira and dumped her body in the Mississippi River . Happy facade: The couple had been married three years and had been experiencing trouble in the relationship when Jeffery brutally murdered Kira in at the home they shared in St. Paul . Scene of the crime: Kira was presumed dead after police officers found the couple's bedroom soaked in blood . Mrs Trevino disappeared on February 21 . this year, and her 39-year-old husband joined her family in the search . for her until her car was found four days later. The car was parked in a ramp at the Mall of America, where she was co-manager of a clothing store for teenage girls. According to her mother, the way the car was parked was one which Kira Trevino would not have been able to manoeuvre. Blood was found on the side of the trunk and the bloodsoaked lining was later discovered nearby. These . findings prompted investigators to search the couple's home in St. Paul . where officers found several freshly washed towels in a basket next to a . dryer alongside the Arkansas Razorbacks shirt Jeffrey Trevino said he . wore on February 21 when his wife went missing. Going . through the house, police also found two bleach-stained towels, a mop, . bucket and cleaning products. In the master bedroom, detectives came . across a gory scene, with blood stains around the bed and a large . human-shaped blood stain on the carpet. Brutal slaying: Kira Trevino was murdered by her husband in February this year but her body was not uncovered until two months after her tragic death . Together: Kira Trevino moved from Wisconsin with her husband Jeffery to St Paul so that he could find work . In . the bedroom, blood was found on the floor, box spring, mattress, bed . frame, bookshelf, closet door, baseboard trim and the wall. Processing . of the home found 'evidence of extensive cleanup efforts,' including . furniture moved to hide evidence, a spray bottle of bleach solution and a . carpet cleaning machine. A carpet cleaner had what appeared to be blood . and human tissue inside of it. Based on the amount of blood found in the home, police presume Mrs Trevino dead. Two months later, her body was found in the Mississippi river. Prosecutors . alleged Trevino was angry that his wife was having an affair and wanted . a divorce. The defense attorney contended the forensic evidence did not . add up. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said he was satisfied with the verdict. ‘The bottom line is we got the conviction. We're very pleased about that,’ Choi said. He noted the difficulty in getting a conviction in a circumstantial case. Grieving: Kira Trevino's family, her mother Marcie sister Keri Anne and father Jay Steger said they were pleased with the guilty verdict but wanted a harsher sentence . Loss: Keri Anne Steger is consoled by Ramsey County Victim Advocate Jennifer Mallinger, right, and others outside the Ramsey County Courthouse in St. Paul, Minnesota . Damning evidence: Kira Trevino's car was found outside her workplace at the Mall of America in Bloomington . Steger's . father, Jay Steger, said he was happy with the conviction but unhappy . Trevino doesn't face more prison time. Prosecutors plan to seek the . maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. ‘I don't think it's enough,’ Steger, 49, of Marshfield, Wisconsin said. '‘I feel no matter how much time he gets, it's not enough because it's not bringing my daughter back.’ Defense attorney John Conrad would not say if he plans to appeal . ‘Obviously . we're disappointed with the conviction,’ Conrad said. But he noted that . Trevino faces about half the prison sentence he would have faced had he . been convicted of second-degree intentional murder. In . closing arguments, the prosecution contended Trevino killed Kira Steger . after becoming fed up with her texting a co-worker with whom she was . having an affair. But the . defense questioned whether Steger's marijuana use may have led to her . death. A bag containing marijuana was found in her purse, but a retired . St. Paul police sergeant testified it was worth only about $20. Jay Steger said it was hard to sit through testimony about his daughter's affair and marijuana use. ‘That . devastated me because they (the defense) were trying to attack her . character and that's not the type of girl she is,’ he said. ‘I think . it's a tragedy they tried to smear her character ... It was very hard . for our family to take that all because we know that's not (her).’ Trevino did not testify in his own defense, and his attorney did not call any witnesses. Sentencing . is scheduled for Nov. 25. Trevino will be held without bail until . sentencing; he has been jailed on $1 million bail since being charged in .

"PUBLISHED: . 22:31 EST, 1 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:59 EST, 3 October 2013 . Bigfoot has long been considered a combination of folklore, misidentification, and hoax, but on Tuesday a team of researchers screened what they claim is conclusive evidence that the creature, also known as Sasquatch, exists. During a news conference in Texas, the group of experts played several short clips that they described as ‘never before seen HD video’ of the supposed ape-like creature. The footage consisted of very short, grainy and out-of-focus clips of various apparently human-like, hairy figures moving about in wooded areas in Kentucky. Scroll down for video . After five years and $500,000, the Sasquatch Genome Project presented footage on Tuesday which it claims is conclusive proof that Bigfoot exists . The footage consisted of very short, grainy and out-of-focus clips of various apparently human-like, hairy figures moving about in wooded areas in Kentucky . The Sasquatch Genome Project team hope that their evidence will go some way to convincing a highly skeptical public about the existence of Bigfoot . In the face of a highly skeptical public and few conclusive sightings, The Sasquatch Genome Project has spent $500,000 on collecting data and evidence over the past five years. ‘This was a serious study,’ Dr. Melba Ketchum told WFAA. She is an expert in forensics and is a director of the project after being impressed by the evidence. The exclusive footage came from a similar effort dubbed The Erickson Project, which was led by Adrian Erickson. That group said it captured the 'definitive video and DNA evidence from the elusive Sasquatch.' During Tuesday's news conference, several clips were shown which the group claims is video evidence that proves Bigfoot is real. The group of experts played several short clips that they described as 'never before seen HD video' of the supposed ape-like creature . It included footage captured in . Kentucky in 2005 shows a female Sasquatch sleeping. An extended version . of the video is expected to be released in a future documentary. ‘We've . all had experiences that changed our lives,’ said researcher Dennis . Pfohl, who showed photos he had taken of footprints in the snow that he . believed belonged to Sasquatch. The announcement comes a week after a new map was unveiled that plots out every reported Bigfoot sighting in North America for the last 92 years. PhD candidate Josh Stevens . mapped out the 3,313 possible Sasquatch spots since 1921 and found that . people do seem to glimpse the hairy creature much more in some regions . than others. The map and data collated by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization show, for example, that Bigfoot has supposedly been spotted three times more often in Missouri than neighboring Kansas. Dr. Melba Ketchum said she joined the project after being impressed by the evidence, while researcher Dennis Pfohl said all of the team had ‘had experiences that changed our lives’ Researcher Dennis Pfohl showed this photo that he had taken of footprints in the snow that he believed belonged to Sasquatch . Stevens . explains on his website: 'Right away you can see that sightings are not . evenly distributed. At first glance, it looks a lot like a map of . population distribution.' This makes sense - by a law of averages you would expect an area with more people to report more possible Sasquatch viewings. Even . so, there are some very bright spots around the Ohio River Valley, . Mississippi River Valley, the Sierra Nevada mountains, central Florida . and the Pacific Northwest. Yet it gets intriguing when Stevens maps the relationship between reported sightings and population density. As he notes: 'There are distinct regions where sightings are incredibly common, despite a very sparse population. Spotting a sasquatch? There are regions of U.S where sightings are very common, despite a low population. And most of them are in the West . 'On the other hand, in some of the most densely populated areas Sasquatch sightings are exceedingly rare.' Most of these Bigfoot hot spots are in the Western United States. Stevens acknowledges that 'terrain and habitat likely play a major role in the distribution of reports.' He notes that the population data . is based on Census figures that only take into account where people . live, not where they vacation or travel. Stevens . also says that the reporting mechanism is not hugely precise as the . Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) only allow spotters to . enter the nearest city.","After five years and $500,000, the Sasquatch Genome Project presented footage on Tuesday which it claims is conclusive proof that Bigfoot exists .

The wife of a former Texas school chief has been arrested for having a two year affair with a teenage student . Maudine D'Elaine Young, 46, who also worked at the same school as a curriculum director, is alleged to have met the high school senior for sex sessions in her car. Their affair took place between 2009-2011 but only came to light after the victim, now aged 23, went to police earlier this year. Young is married to the former superintendent for Greenwood ISD in Midland, Texas, where they both worked at the time of the alleged affair. The student went to police on June 15th to make an official complaint about the sexual activity. Investigators said Young began the affair with the student after calling him into her office,closing the door and kissing him. The victim said Young later texted him and asked him to meet her in a parking lot before they drove to a deserted oil field lease where they had sex in her car. According to the arrest report, the former student said he was a senior at Greenwood High School when Young called and texted him all that day and evening. He said Young picked him up in the early morning hours from his parent's home and drove to a deserted field where they had sex. Phone records between the victim and Young were subpoenaed and indicated several phone calls and text messages supporting the man's accusations. Earlier this year she was moved from the job as curriculum director to that of assistant principal at Brooks Middle School. Both Mrs Young and her husband worked at Greenwood High School in Midland, Texas, (pictured) where she met the victimGreenwood High School in Midland, Texas . The same month she moved, her husband stepped down from his $116,000 a year job as school's superintendent. His decision to resign came before the allegations of his wife's illicit affair. US Marshalls assisted in the arrest of Young at her home in Wise County. Midland County Sheriff Gary Painter said Young's arrest was shocking but said sex between educators and students happens. 'It's a shock to me that an adult would conduct themselves in that manner. They know it's wrong, they know it's a violation of the law, they know it's illegal yet they still do it,' he said.

The animal only survived the 3,000-mile trip by eating cardboard and licking condensation off its surroundings. The cargo was then driven 300 miles to Ebbw Vale in South Wales, where workers at Sears Seating - who were expecting a delivery of machine parts - discovered the animal. The raccoon, a common pest in north America, was taken to the Wales Ape and Monkey sanctuary in Abercave where it was given food and water. Survivor: Meeka's container was then put on a ship and embarked on a journey across the Atlantic Ocean . Meeko is now in the sanctuary's rabies quarantine centre and, according to staff, is 'doing well'. Jan Garen, who runs the Wales Ape and Monkey Sanctuary with her husband Graham, told the South Wales Evening Post: 'She came all the way from the America, we know this because she arrived inside a container delivered to Sears Seating in Ebbw Vale via Liverpool. 'When they saw her they notified Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), they had no choice. 'Defra then contacted us because we have quarantine facilities to keep her in quarantine.' The adult female, named Meeko by staff after the raccoon in film Pocahontas, was the worse for wear on arrival. Trip: The animal travelled 3,000 miles to Liverpool, England, living off a diet of cardboard and condensation . Mrs Garen added: 'She is getting used to us but she has had a rough ride. 'She was locked in that container for four weeks and somehow survived by drinking condensation and eating cardboard. 'It's obvious that she wasn't a pet, she's a wild animal so she has to be handled very carefully.'

In 'good form': Michaella McCollum and Melissa Reid, pictured from left to right arriving in handcuffs for a court hearing in Callao, Peru, yesterday evening, are said to be 'very, very well' after being moved to a new prison . New look: Michaella McCollum, from Northern Ireland, ditched her signature bun for loose and straightened hair when she attended a closed court hearing at 11am Peru time . 'As well as that they had telephone communication and they could use it for calling home. I thought they were in great form actually.' Father Foley, who had to wait a month to be allowed in to visit the young women because of a flu outbreak in the prison, said the pair can sit out all day every day and make as many calls as they wish, so long as they have money to cover it. His remarks come as the two appeared for a private hearing with a judge at Sarita Colonia del Callao jail, in Callao, near Lima, yesterday looking healthy and apparently with new items of clothing, including new shoes. McCollum even had a new hairdo - getting rid of her trademark bun in exchange for long, straight locks. Last week McCollum, 20, from Dungannon, Co Tyrone, and co-accused Reid, 20, from Glasgow, pleaded guilty to drug smuggling when they appeared before a judge. They had hoped the behind-closed-doors admission would be enough to secure a shorter sentence.

Contact: Both Melissa Reid, left,and Michaella McCollum Connolly have also been allowed to call their families so long as they pay for the cost of the calls . However, the prosecutor in charge of their case said that the pair could face a six-month investigation if their guilty pleas are rejected. Speaking after yesterday's hearing, Juan Mendoza said that the women's confessions had not satisfied prosecutors. If their pleas are turned down by the court, prosecutors could force them to return to the interrogation room and give more details about the smuggling gang which allegedly gave them the drugs. Mr Mendoza refused to say whether or not the women had told him anything more about the gang. They were moved to the modern jail after spending time in the harsh Virgen de Fatima prison in Lima. Change: The pair had spent time in the harsh Virgen de Fatima prison in Lima before being moved to a new jail . Story: Melissa Reid and Michaella McCollum initially claimed they had been kidnapped and forced to board a flight with cocaine hidden inside their luggage . Father Foley said he did not speak to the pair about their legal case. But . he said that he took McCollum to one side during the visit and advised . her that she should not expect to secure a sentence as low as one year. The priest said he expected a seven year sentence, which could be . reduced at a later stage. McCollum . was very emotional when the priest warned her about the jail sentence. He said the women were sadder and wiser for the experience. Father . Foley also suggested they might get moved to a new prison in the north . of Lima after sentencing which has an area dedicated for foreigners.

Suspect: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, is now in prison and his lawyers argue that the treatment he is receiving is overly harsh . The two men accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing spent the days and hours after the attack destroying evidence and building more bombs, it emerged today. A memo from Attorney General Eric Holder revealed the details . of what investigators allege the bombing suspects did after the April 15 attacks. Holder wrote the letter to the bureau of prisons director to justify why the 'Special Administrative Measures' were imposed on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev after his lawyers said the 'overly harsh' restrictions placed on him in prison were unjustifiable. Tsarnaev's lawyers said he has been . confined to his cell except for visits from them and 'very limited . access' to a small outdoor enclosure. He is not allowed to receive mail or use the telephone. They argued the conditions have left him nearly totally isolated and are impairing their ability to defend him. Tsarnaev, 20, is accused of building and planting bombs near the finish line of the April 15 marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 260.

The special restrictions were placed . on shoe bomb suspect Richard Reid, 'American Taliban' John Walker Lindh . and other terror suspects. Tsarnaev's lawyers say prosecutors have presented no evidence that the special restrictions are needed in his case. Horrific: After planting multiple bombs near the marathon finish line, the Tsarnaev brothers killed three people and injured more than 260 in the blasts . Faces in the crowd: Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan were tracked by police using surveillance footage, and Tamerlan was killed in the ensuing shoot out with police . The memo, obtained by the LA Times, claims Dzhokhar and his . brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev - who was killed four days after the bombing - . spent much of their time after the bombing trying to get rid of evidence and reaffirming . their Jihad beliefs. Holder said that Tsarnaev discarded a . remaining bomb detonator and smashed a cellphone he used to secretly . communicate with his brother about the bombing. When the younger brother was found hiding in a boat on, they were anti-America scrawlings on the inside. 'Tsarnaev's brother was killed in the . drawn-out altercation while he evaded capture and hid inside a . dry-locked boat in a residential neighborhood,' Holder wrote. 'While hiding he scrawled . messages including ""The U.S. government is killing our innocent . civilians"", ""I cant stand to see such evil go unpunished"", ""We Muslims . are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all"". 'Following his capture, he was . interviewed by the FBI and reaffirmed his commitment to Jihad and . expressed hope that his actions would inspire others to engage in . violent conduct. there is no evidence that his intentions have changed . since.' The document also claims the pair made additional bombs after the marathon and persuaded others to destroy evidence. Planned: The location of the bombs at the area full of foot traffic and awaiting pedestrians shows that their intent was to kill and injure as many as possible . The accused bomber's lawyers said his legal rights are being violated and said in their filing: 'The government has not alleged that . Mr Tsarnaev has done or said anything since his arrest to commit . violence, incite violence, or engage in communications that pose a . security threat. They . also said the special measures limit Tsarnaev's interaction with people . who are helping the defense and restrict the communications and other . activities of the defense team.

A Zumba instructor says her devotion to the fitness classes nearly killed her - after they caused an undetected hole in her heart to grow bigger and bigger. Nicole Saville, 20, had to have her chest cut open in January to allow doctors to sew up the hole which was 'insignificant’ when she was born. The fitness fanatic from Mirfield, West Yorkshire, first noticed something was awry when she became tired and breathless, but never suspected it could be something so serious. Nicole Saville, 20, was diagnosed with a hole in the heart after becoming tired and breathless. The Zumba instructor had probably had the hole since birth but her active lifestyle could have made it worse . Without major open-heart surgery, Ms Saville would have been at risk of suffering a severe heart attack or stroke as the hole in her heart caused one side of the vital organ to become enlarged. She said: 'I wasn’t feeling well at all. I was really run down and I was finding teaching difficult. 'Doctors did a series of tests and found an infection, which led them to tell me I had a virus in my liver. 'I put up with it for a couple of months until I started having trouble breathing and I was admitted to hospital.' Further tests and an ECG revealed Ms Saville had a heart murmur and an ultrasound soon found the hole in her heart - something that she is likely to have had since birth. Doctors told her the hole could have been made worse by exercise. In January, surgeons at Leeds General Infirmary performed open-heart surgery on the Zumba instructor after a keyhole procedure failed. Surgeons tried to close the hole in Ms Saville's heart during a keyhole procedure but it failed so she had to have open-heart surgery which involved breaking her sternum . After the surgery, Ms Saville had to sleep sitting up for five weeks and she has to spend six months recovering before returning to Zuma . But in order to operate on her successfully, doctors had to break her sternum. This involved making an incision in her abdomen and disjointing the ribs behind her chest. To close the wound, medics inserted metal wires to pull Ms Saville’s chest back together, for her bone to grow around and heal. She said: 'When I woke up, I must have just twitched a tiny amount and the whole top half of my body was in agony. Ms Saville said: 'When I woke up, I must have just twitched a tiny amount and the whole top half of my body was in agony. There was a searing pain across my chest and it took my breath away' 'There was a searing pain across my chest and it took my breath away. Just the slightest movement made everything hurt. 'I had to be washed, dressed, showered, and even have my teeth brushed and walking was particularly difficult. 'I couldn’t walk and my arms hanging down by my side was incredibly painful.' As well as being forced to sleep sitting upright for the first five weeks, Ms Saville then faced a six-month recovery period, before she could get back to her active self. She said: 'I had to be washed, dressed, showered, and even have my teeth brushed and walking was particularly difficult. I couldn't walk and my arms handing down by my side was incredibly painful' She said: 'It was really hard . stopping my fitness. It was going really well before I found out about . the hole in my heart and I was developing a client base who I didn’t . want to let down. 'Everything . stopped and came to a standstill. I was just trying to establish myself . when I had to wait until I was better to carry on.' She . added: 'I didn’t talk about it much while I was ill. It would have been . really easy to just mope about and I wanted to stay as positive as . possible. To correct the hole in Ms Saville's heart, surgeons had to open up her chest and separate her sternum . 'When you’re told something like that you have to stay strong for self-preservation. 'It . was really hard being in a hospital surrounded by elderly patients but I . knew I needed the operation, even though I am so young.' Ms . Saville’s heart condition was not picked up on while she was a baby, . she and her parents Sandra and Andrew Saville, have since discovered . that a simple test could have been done. Mrs Saville, 51, said: 'Nicole’s . condition wasn’t picked up when she was born because the hole was so . small and wasn’t causing her obvious symptoms. 'But . now I think back to things that were unexplained and now they make . sense. I just didn’t want to over-react and panic over the smallest of . things. 'It’s such a cheap test and most parents would pay out of their own pockets just to be sure if they knew it could potentially save their child in the future. 'It should be something that is checked as standard.' Despite still getting aches and pains, Ms Saville is now back to her active self and she is looking forward to a successful life as a Zumba instructor with the support of fiancé Oliver Horne. She said: 'My family and Oliver have been so supportive throughout everything and been there for me through all the bad times when I wasn’t feeling myself. 'This is something that is associated with people in their 70s and 80s but people need to realise that it happens to young people like me as well.' Ms Saville (pictured with her fiancé, Oliver) is now hoping to return to work as a Zumba instructor. She also hopes to raise awareness about holes in the heart so people realise they can happen to anyone . Ms Saville is hoping to raise . awareness of her experience to help other young adults who may suffer . with a hole in their heart that is not detected until later in life. She . has so far raised £500 for Take Heart, a Yorkshire-based charity which . aims to help patients suffering from heart conditions and offers support . to their relatives. He . mother added: 'Take Heart gave me a room next door to where Nicole was . in the hospital with a bed and a shower. It was all free and it was . fantastic because I could just be there for her the whole time.' Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'If there is something wrong with a baby’s heart at birth they are said to have congenital heart disease. Ms Saville said: 'It was really hard stopping my fitness. It was going really well before I found out about the hole in my heart and I was developing a client base who I didn't want to let down' 'There are many types of congenital heart disease and ""hole in the heart"" is a rare defect in the wall between two of the heart’s chambers. 'Some congenital heart problems are now picked up during pregnancy but sometimes they’re not found until the baby has been born. 'Some conditions may not be discovered until the child is an adult, although a hole in the heart is more commonly spotted in childhood. 'It’s vitally important a hole in the heart is picked up as early as possible so children can be monitored and get the right treatment, which is normally heart surgery. If you want more information about congenital heart disease, call our Heart Helpline on 0300 330 3311.' Holes in the heart are congenital heart defects which change the normal flow of blood through the heart. The hole is usually found in the wall between the two different sides of the heart - the septum. About eight in every 1,000 babies have a hole in the heart. Symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, a build up of fluid in the lungs and swelling in the ankles, feet, legs and abdomen. If the hole is not closed, it can cause heart failure or stroke. Whether treatment is required depends on the severity of the problem - some people never require treatment for the hole in their heart. If the hole is large, surgery if often required to close it.

The widow of poisoned ex-KGB spy Alexander Litvinenko has been refused legal funding to challenge the Government's decision not to hold a public inquiry into his death. Three judges at London’s High Court - Lord Justice Goldring, Lord Justice Treacy and Mr Justice Mitting - refused to make a 'protected costs' order. It means Marina Litvinenko - the only person eligible to challenge Theresa May's ruling - could be stripped her of all her assets if she lost the case. The judges said they would give their reasons tomorrow morning. Denied: Marina Litvinenko, pictured at court today, could lose all her assets if she challenges the Government . Poisoned: ALexander Litvinenko was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 in tea in a London hotel . Ben Emerson QC, appearing for the widow, blasted the setback in a case which he claims is of 'national and international interest'. Today he explained his client . wanted a public inquiry because she backed the Coroner’s view that an . inquest would return an 'unjust and distorted' verdict . that was contrary to the evidence already heard. Mr Emerson told the judges: 'Her . Majesty’s Government is in possession of evidence which shows there is . at least a prime facie case that his murder was ordered by officials of . the Russian government.' The murder was 'an act of nuclear . terrorism on the streets of London,' he said. Asking for legal costs to be covered, Mr Emerson explained the challenge - if unsuccessful - could lead to a £40,000 bill, which is almost 'everything she has in terms of assets she can access'. He added: 'Mrs Litvinenko . regards her life as being on hold. It is very difficult for her to make . decisions about the future until this process has come to a conclusion.' Long battle: Widow Marina has given countless interviews about what she calls a 'murder ordered by Kremlin' Since her husband’s death she and their son Anatoly have battled to discover the truth about what led to his killing. Mr Litvinenko’s family believe he was working for MI6 at the time of his death and was killed on the orders of the Kremlin. Mr Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea with two Russian men, one a former KGB officer, at the Millennium Hotel in London’s Grosvenor Square in 2006. Coroner Sir Robert Owen asked for the public inquiry, saying that he could not hear evidence in public at a normal inquest linked to the alleged involvement of the Russian state in Mr Litvinenko’s death. A further hearing will be held to decide whether or not Mrs Litvinenko can challenge Theresa May's ruling . Despite his request, the Home Secretary decided in May that the inquest should proceed, and the question whether to hold a public inquiry or other form of further investigation should be decided after a verdict was returned. Mr Litvinenko’s widow Marina was left 'shocked and disappointed' and launched proceedings to challenge the Home Secretary’s decision. The question whether she should be given . the go-ahead to challenge Home Secretary Theresa May’s decision refusing . an immediate inquiry is to be dealt with by judges at a further . hearing.","Judges at London's High Court refused to make 'protected costs' order .

Dezi Hughes, who has chosen to reveal her identity following her horrific ordeal, was told on Tuesday that she could not play the sport which she finds therapeutic. Miss Hughes was abducted with her friend Kathlynn Shepard as they walked home from school in May in Dayton, Iowa. Miss Shepard was murdered and her body found in the Des Moines river a month later. Healing process: Dezi Hughes, 12, who was abducted by a sex offender in May, has been banned from her high school's volleyball court because she was not wearing the correct outfit . Missed out: Miss Hughes, who is currently having therapy twice a week following her abduction, wore this outfit to school on volleyball day but was told it didn't fit the rules . Miss Hughes managed to escape from convict Michael Klunder and ran to get help. The sex offender later committed suicide. As part of her healing process, the 12-year-old has been attending twice-weekly therapy sessions but also finds solace from her ordeal in sports, in particular horse riding and playing on her high school volleyball team. However on Tuesday, school authorities told the girl that she had not worn an appropriate outfit to school to be allowed to take part in the game. Miss Hughes' shorts and long-sleeved top was not in keeping with the 'good conduct policy' of wearing more formal attire on sports days.

The following month, the body of 15-year-old Kathlynn was found in the Des Moines River. Chief . State Medical Examiner Dr Julia Goodin said Kathlynn's death was a . homicide and that she died of 'multiple sharp and blunt force injuries'. Authorities also found zip ties on Shephard matching ones used to restrain Miss Hughes, who managed to escape and call 911. 'Today our family has lost part of its soul - not just the Shepard family but the families of Dayton and all of Iowa,' the Shepards said in a statement in June. Offender: Authorities say registered sex offender Michael Klunder kidnapped Kathlynn Shepard and her friend before murdering Kathlynn then killing himself four hours later .

A haul of previously unheard songs recorded on cassette tape by a 15-year-old Gary Barlow in his bedroom have come to light. The 100 tracks, on nine cassettes, have spent the last 20 years at the back of a fan’s music collection. Each tape has a handwritten tracklisting of the songs with unknown titles including ‘My Kind of Girl’, ‘Suddenly’ and ‘Your Power to Me.’ And four of the songs even went on to be . used by Take That: ‘A Million Love Songs’, ‘Nobody Else’, . ‘Another Track in my Heart’ and ‘You are the One’. Fan alert: Take That fans now have the opportunity to buy the ultimate Gary Barlow memeribilia - almost one hundred songs by teenage Gary Barlow that have never been heard before . Bidding: Auctioneers in West Sussex expect the collection of rare tapes to go for £2,000 . The cassettes of five hours worth of self-written songs were recorded by Barlow in 1986, and the last tape is thought to be from 1990. Band manager Nigel Martin-Smith first heard the collection of songs the year before and was so impressed he chose Gary to be the lead singer of the boy band he was creating. Gary, pictured with Sharon Osbourne, is now a head judge on the X Factor talent show . He then went on to hold auditions for others young men to be part of the group and eventually chose Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen and Robbie Williams. The cassettes have been owned by a private collector for the past two decades and he has now decided to put them up for sale. They are expected to go for £2,000 in the sale at Bellmans Auctioneers in Billingshurst, West Sussex. Simon Garner, 38, auctioneer at Bellmans, said: 'This is clearly an unusual set of items to sell. 'In . my mind Gary Barlow is in the lime light at the moment, if he’s not . doing charity work he is on the television and is quite a likeable . character. 'Take That are . huge so I think there is definitely a collector or someone out there who . would be interested in buying these cassettes. 'An awful lot of these songs, 95 out . of the 100, haven’t been released before and when I looked up a . selection of them I found nothing.' Mr Garner said that there are around ten tracks on each cassette and the listing is handwritten on the back. 'Any fan who buys these would be getting a lot of songs that haven’t been heard before for their own personal use,' he said. Four of Gary's teenage songs went on to be used by Take That, pictured (without Robbie Williams) in 1996 when they announced their breakup. From left, Jason Orange, Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald . 'The songs may not have been released for many reasons, it was at the start of his career so he could have decided they weren’t good enough or found better songs. 'He could may well have recorded them in his bedroom for all we know as he was only 15 in 1986, and we think it might be him playing the keyboard on some of the tracks.' Auctioneers have not yet played the cassette tapes in fear that they may become jammed and break. The tapes are offered for sale without copyright, broadcast rights, performers consents and other re-production rights, so the buyer would only be able to listen to them. The auction is on October 11.","100 previously unheard songs up for grabs at a West Sussex auction .

James Peter Sabatino posed as a record company executive had unpaid hotel bills of $250K in MiamiJames Peter Sabatino . A conman who posed as a record company executive in Miami has been arrested for not paying hotel bills of up to $250,000. Peter Sabatino, 36, was held after police burst into his Miami hotel room where he was having sex with a teenage girl. One of his unpaid bills at a Hilton Hotel included bottles of champagne that amounted to $100,000. Sabatino is alleged to have stayed at several Miami Beach hotels with friends after allegedly fooling them into believing he was a record executive entertaining corporate clients. He is alleged to have persuaded the hotels that the bills for his stay should be sent to his employer. 'He lived like a king,' said Miami Beach police Sgt. Bobby Hernandez. Police said Sabatino told staff at the Eden Roc hotel, favored by A-list celebrities - that he was working for Warner Bros. pictures and needed three rooms. His three day stay cost was $7,000 before he allegedly walked out without paying. Sabatino, who weighs 360lbs at 5 foot 6, next checked into the SLS Hotel on Miami's South Beach. He said he worked for the record label Roc-A-Fella and that he was there to entertain the rapper J. Cole. The hotel checked him into two $697-a-night private villas and one $296-a-night room. Once the bill hit $16,000, he and his friends took off. Next stop was the South Beach Hilton where he posed as a Sony executive. During his five week stay he ran up a bill of $150,000 - with $100,000 spent on champagne. Police said he and his entourage ordered only the finest food and are said to have run room service waiters ragged with their continual orders. Sabatino was staying at luxury hotels around Miami including the SLS Hotel South Beach (pictured)SLS Hotel South Beach . Investigators sent out a bulletin to all hotels in the Greater Miami area as US Marshalls joined local law enforcement in the search for the alleged conman. A manager at the Hyatt Regency in Coral Gables saw the bulletin and recognized him as a guest who had checked in last Friday, asking for several rooms, including the presidential suite. The manager called police. When officers arrived at 2 a.m., they found their man in bed, having consensual sex with a 17-year-old girl, police said. Officers found $50,000 worth of champagne in his Honda Civic car. Sabatino had two outstanding warrants at the time of his arrest, one from Broward County and the other from a federal probation violation. Sabatino,whose father once managed a restaurant owned by the sons of infamous New York City mobster Paul Castellano, has a history of white-collar crime that began when he was a teenager, according to court records. At 18, Sabatino posed as a Blockbuster executive and was able to accumulate 262 tickets to the 1995 Super Bowl in Miami. He sold them for $170,000 then went on the run, but turned himself in six months later, saying he was tired of hiding out. When he was 22, Sabatino threatened to 'cut the [bleep]ing heads off' federal prosecutors investigating his uncle and other alleged South Florida organized crime figures. In a plea deal, federal prosecutors dropped a slew of charges, including ones stemming from Sabatino’s alleged threats to kill then-President Bill Clinton and his brother, Roger, decapitate a federal judge and two prosecutors, and blow up the federal courthouse in downtown Fort Lauderdale. Sabatino faces charges of grand theft, organized fraud and unlawful sexual acts with a minor. He is being held at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on $55,000 bond.","Peter Sabatino was busted by Miami police, while having sex with a teenage girl in one of the hotel rooms .

Lucy Mimran then appealed, winning a $7.4 million judgment from a higher court in March. So far, Mimran has only paid $400,000. While . apparently poverty-stricken, Mimran was allegedly lavishing expensive gifts on . his new wife including a $30,000 Rolex and a $20,000 Chanel bag.

But a source close to Lucy told the Post that the $5 million valuation for the shared property is grossly inflated and the goods are in fact worth no more than $600,000. The news comes just days after it was revealed Mimran and Ordon are being sued by their landlord after allegedly trashing their $32,000-a-month Manhattan apartment and failing to pay several months' rent.

A depraved killer who sexually assaulted and murdered his step-grandmother after accessing hardcore pornography has been jailed for life. Jack Huxley, 20, murdered 62-year-old Janis Dundas at her home in Atherton Road, Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, after she had taken him in 'out of the goodness of her heart', Liverpool Crown Court heard. The pensioner was found by police officers face down in a pool of blood in her bedroom with three knives protruding from her back. She had been mutilated, stabbed and slashed 28 times and had suffered a sexual assault. The court heard how Huxley accessed pornography showing sex between young men and mature women in the hours before and after the murder. Killer: Jack Huxley, left, pleaded guilty to . killing step-grandmother Janis Dundas, right, at her home in Ellesmere . Port, Cheshire . Sentencing Huxley to life, with a recommendation that he serve at least 21 years and eight months before being considered for parole, the Recorder of Liverpool Judge Clement Goldstone said the killing 'plumbed the depths of depravity and brutality'. The defendant, who had taken a cocktail of alcohol and drugs at the time of the murder, was sentenced after pleading guilty to murder yesterday. Huxley, with short cropped brown hair and wearing a white shirt, held his head in his hands throughout the hearing. Judge Goldstone said Mrs Dundas offered Huxley lodging after he had been made an 'outcast' by his family due to his reliance on drink and drugs. 'Within less than 24 hours you were to repay that kindness and common decency in a way which was as inhuman as it was gratuitously violent,' Judge Goldstone said. The judge said that on the night he had been welcomed into the victim’s home the defendant did not go to bed. 'Instead you searched Janis Dundas’s . computer for hardcore pornographic websites - not just any hardcore . pornographic websites, but those which in some respects were able to . satisfy an interest in sexual activity between young men and women of a . mature age,' he said. The . court heard that earlier that day, April 4, the defendant carried out . the same searches on his own laptop as well as using the victim’s . computer to carry out more porn searches of that nature after he had . murdered her. Admission: Huxley initially denied murdering Mrs Dundas, but pleaded guilty to the crime at Liverpool Crown Court, pictured . Judge Goldstone said: 'I am sure that on that night you spent some considerable time on such websites... in order to arouse yourself sexually with a view to having intercourse with her.' The judge said he was 'in no doubt whatsoever' that Huxley not only planned to have sex with his step- grandmother but that he did have penetrative sex with her that night. He added: 'I am sure that, in fact, your sexual assault upon her began and continued either whilst she was asleep or not responding.' He said one of the reasons he carried out the assault was his apparent inability to form a sexual relationship or any meaningful relationship with a girl of his own age. The court heard that after the sexual assault Huxley armed himself with four kitchen knives and a skewer and went on to murder and mutilate his step-grandmother. The judge said only Huxley knew why he had murdered Mrs Dundas but he said there could only be two reasons: 'Either you were so frustrated by the unsatisfactory sex that had taken place, or you were so disgusted by what you had done that you decided, there and then, to kill her.' After the sentencing, Jessica Knight, Mrs Dundas’s daughter, said: 'She was a mummy, a grandmother, sister and daughter, a clever and insightful woman murdered so brutally by a man she had invited into her home. 'Her murder has left a deep and dark hole in our lives. The sentence imposed in some ways reflects the gravity of this crime and gives us some consolation.' She added: 'Our wonderful life has been shattered and all we can now do is try not to let the incomprehensible actions of one man become our focus. 'Instead, we will try to rejoice in the memories we have of a truly wonderful woman, our beautiful mummy.'","Jack Huxley pleaded guilty to murdering Janis Dundas in her own home .

About a third of six-year-olds are still struggling with their reading after their first year at school, official figures show. Some 69 per cent of Year 1 pupils at mainstream state schools scored 32 out of 40, the standard expected. Almost 180,000 children fell short of the standard in tests, although it was an 11 per cent improvement on the previous year. Girls beat boys in the Department of Education figures but one third of six-year-olds still struggle with reading . Girls outperformed boys, with 73 per cent reaching the target compared with 65 per cent. By the end of Year 2, however, 85 per cent of pupils had achieved the desired mark or higher. The Department for Education’s figures are based on the results of controversial new ‘synthetic phonics’ tests that were introduced last year. Teachers have opposed the measure, in which children have to say 40 words – half of which are made up ‘pseudo-words’. Ministers said the tests . would help boost reading standards but they have faced deep opposition . among teachers, who claimed it would not give them sufficient . information about children’s abilities and risked labelling them as . failures at an early age. A survey by the National Literacy Trust has also revealed that more than a fifth of children think it is embarrassing to be seen reading a book – a leap of five per cent on two years ago. Teaching unions have condemned the tests based on phonics but Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said checks help identify pupils who need extra learning to read . Those reading in their own time have also plummeted, from 38 per cent in 2005 to 24 per cent now. More than a quarter of the 35,000 children aged eight to 16 who took part revealed their parents don’t care if they like books. Those . who didn’t think ‘reading is cool’ were four times more likely to have . below-average reading skills for their age - 22.7 per cent compared to . 5.8 per cent. The National Literacy Trust is trying to reverse the trend . with a Literacy Heroes campaign involving people who have made a . positive impact on reading including bestselling authors Joanna Trollope . and Dorothy Koomson. Its patron, the Duchess of Cornwall said to was important to ‘ignite a passion for reading in the next generation’. The National Literacy Trust patron, the Duchess of Cornwall, said to was important to 'ignite a passion for reading in the next generation' Director Jonathan Douglas added: ‘Our . research not only reveals children are reading less and developing more . negative attitudes towards reading but also that there is a clear . correlation between this and their performance in reading tests.’ Teacher assessment figures for children at the end of Key Stage 1 were also published yesterday. The number of seven-year-old who reached the expected level in reading, writing, and speaking and listening rose slightly to 89 per cent, 85 per cent and 89 per cent respectively. Maths was the same as last year, on 91 per cent. Teachers’ unions renewed their attacks on the phonics test yesterday. Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, described it as ‘pernicious’. She added: ‘Children develop at different levels. The slow reader at five can easily be the good reader by the age of 11. ‘We cannot continue with this obsession of testing and categorising as failures our very young children.’ But Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said checks would help identify pupils who need extra help learning to read. ‘Many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to catch up with their peers and develop a love of reading,’ she added.","Department of Education figures show girls outperformed boys in the tests .

Hearing: An inquest has heard how Erena Louise Wilson (pictured), who was killed by a falling branch, may not have died if the trees had been properly pruned . An accounts manager who was hit by a falling branch at the Royal Botanic Gardens may not have been killed if the tree had been pruned properly, a hearing heard yesterday. Erena Wilson, 31, died instantly when she was struck on the head by a 12inch-thick branch from a Lebanese cedar while she was strolling with two friends. Rain and gusts of winds of up to 30mph had been sweeping around the gardens just before the branch fell. Miss Wilson’s two friends ran when they heard a crack ‘like thunder’, but when they looked back they found her lying on the ground covered in branches. West London Coroner’s Court yesterday heard that it was a ‘fluke’ that only one person was killed or hurt at Kew Gardens, West London, in September last year. The pre-inquest hearing was told either under-pruning or a phenomenon known as ‘summer branch drop’, in which trees struggling to absorb water shed their branches, may have caused the fall. Assistant Coroner Elizabeth Pygott said the probe should focus on whether proper trimming of the trees may have prevented the branch crashing onto Miss Wilson. ‘There is the question of whether pruning the trees may have prevented the fall from happening’, she said. John McLinden QC, representing Miss Wilson’s family, said that Kew Gardens may not have had a policy to deal with the dangers of summer branch drop. He told the hearing: ‘Kew recognised the danger of summer branch drop and the implementation of it did not occur. ‘Did Kew ever warn members of the public of summer branch drop and did they cease those warning? Did they take precautions by cordoning off areas and did they cease doing that as well?’ Fall: The Lebanese cedar tree at Kew Gardens in south west London, whose branch hit account manager Erena Wilson . Scene: John McLinden, representing Miss Wilson's family, said if summer branch drop did cause the branch to collapse then Kew Gardens would need to take further measures to protect the public . Mr McLinden added that if summer branch drop did cause the branch to collapse on Ms Wilson then Kew Gardens would need to take further measures to protect the public. ‘Kew is not only a World Heritage Site but a public body - it is virtually a public park that has visitors exceeding one million a year’, he added. ‘There is a public interest for people to know about this dangerous phenomenon.’ Ms Wilson, who was originally from New Zealand and lived in Ealing, west London, worked as an account manager for Deluxe Digital Studios. Tragic: Miss Wilson (pictured) had been walking through the Royal Botanic Gardens with two friends at the time of the incident . Speaking outside of court, Miss Wilson’s uncle, Pieter van Vliet, said the family wanted the issue of summer branch drop to be explored during the inquest to prevent further deaths. ‘We’re not experts but obviously Kew Gardens has trees, a lot of them, so potentially there is a good reason for bringing this up,’ he said. Mr van Vliet, 49, said his niece was a regular visitor to Kew, and added that the family would be ‘forever grateful’ for the support given to them by the gardens, including hosting a memorial event. Her mother Liz Shelley, 54, flew over from the family home in Auckland after her death and held an emotional meeting with workers at Kew Gardens. Focus: Assistant Coroner Elizabeth Pygot said the inquest should focus on whether proper trimming of the trees may have prevented the branch falling on to Miss Wilson (pictured) She said yesterday from New Zealand: ‘For the first few weeks I had so many questions, back then I would not have let the inquest come to an end. ‘Then I came to Kew and I saw the staff cry, they were devastated. That changed everything. I could see I wasn’t alone in questioning what had happened and this had happened despite good people trying their very best.’ Kew Gardens was closed to the public after her death and remained shut the following day after severe weather warnings. The investigation has been passed from the police, who found no suspicious circumstances, onto the Health and Safety Executive. The hearing continues.","Erena Louise Wilson died when she was hit by part of a Lebanese cider .

Hundreds of acres of an ancient forest are being felled because trees are infected with disease, the Woodland Trust has said. Larches in Wales's largest ancient forest, Wentwood Forest, near Newport, Gwent, have been confirmed as infected with Phytophthora ramorum, a fungus-like disease which causes extensive damage and death to trees. The Woodland Trust and Natural Resource Wales, who own most of the 2,500 acre woodland, are clear-felling diseased larch from one fifth of the forest from this week. Hundreds of acres of Wales's largest ancient forest, Wentwood Forest, are being felled to fight disease . Trees are infected with Phytophthora ramorum, a fungus-like disease which causes extensive damage and death . But the disease, which has affected larches across south west England, South Wales, Northern Ireland and the west of Scotland, is expected to continue to spread through the forest, requiring further felling in the coming months and years. The clear-felling will undermine seven years of work to restore the forest to natural broadleaf woodland through the gradual removal of conifers, that allows regeneration of native plants, the Woodland Trust said. Wentwood Forest is one of a number of sites of ancient woodland planted with conifers in the 1940s and 1950s to provide fast growing wood for building, leading to dense shading, soil disturbance and acidic soils which damage natural species. Ancient woodland covers 2 per cent of the UK, and damaged sites planted with conifers make up half that figure, the Woodland Trust said. The Woodland Trust said it is the most 'serious and devastating action' taken on the estate . Immediately after felling the larches, the Trust will replant the wood with native broadleaf trees such as oak and cherry in the hope of preserving woodland specialist plants that only thrive when sheltered by the tree canopy. The replanting will leave the Trust with a . £35,000 bill, as there are no restocking grants available in Wales this . year, unlike England, where grants are available, the charity said. Andrew Sharkey, Woodland Trust head of woodland management, said: 'This is the most serious and devastating action we've had to take on our estate and it again highlights both the need to tackle tree disease and the importance of restoring as much of our damaged ancient woodland to make it more resilient in decades to come. 'Restoration will allow native trees to establish themselves over a long period of time. 'Creating a resilient woodland landscape with different species of trees of different ages is the most effective natural weapon to ensure tree disease does not decimate the countryside.' Wentwood Forest is Wales's largest ancient forest and covers 2,500 acres outside Newport, Gwent . John Browne, from Natural Resources Wales, said: 'The felling in Wentwood Forest is very sad but this prompt action by the Woodland Trust (Coed Cadw) is essential to try to slow the spread of this devastating disease.' He said Natural Resources Wales had invested £500,000 to stop the spread of the disease and an additional £2 million had been set aside for future work. 'Our ultimate aim is to make our forests more resilient to pests and diseases and we are heartened that the Woodland Trust is to seize this opportunity to undertake change of structure and species within Wentwood Forest by planting native broadleaves.' Woodland across the UK is under threat from a number of tree diseases, including the arrival last year of ash dieback, which seriously damages and kills large numbers of ash trees, an important native species.","The Woodland Trust cutting down 500 acres of larches in Wentwood Forest .

An ancient Buddha statue has been given a new look after locals donated a gigantic golden cassock to cover its crumbling parts. The 1,500-year-old Mengshan Buddha on Meng Mountain near Taiyuan, in Shanxi province has seen some wear and tear over the years and is in dire need of a sprucing up. Last year, the 206ft (63 metre) tall statue was given a £6.6million facelift, however the money did not last further down than the neck. Dressed for success: The 1,500 years old 'Mengshan Buddha' has been given a giant robe to cover up and protect its crumbling body . Disrobed: The popular tourist attraction has suffered some wear and dear throughout the centuries and is in need of repair . To cover the weathered section of the statue, those who run the tourist attraction organised for a team of people to hand-craft the cloak - which is golden in colour to emulate the gowns worn by Buddhists in monasteries. A team of around ten locals then ascended the statue and draped it in the cloak - which weighs over 400kg. It will remain in place for the duration of the Chinese public holiday - National Day, which runs from October 1-7. The Mengshan Buddha is said to be . China’s oldest stone-carved Buddha statue. But it was not discovered until . 2005, when a local farmer stumbled upon the relic. Due to its poor condition caused by 1,500 years of exposure to the weather, in 2012 China's Ministry of Land Resources gave 10.8million Yuen (£6.6million) towards restoring the remarkable statue. As well as being in poor condition, years of mining in the area had meant the statue was at high risk of collapse. According to state news agency .

A man who lay down on train tracks after a heavy drinking session survived with just a cut to the head when a commuter train went right over him. William McNeil, 51, from Blackburn, stumbled onto the track outside the Lancashire town's station shortly before a Northern Rail commuter train thundered towards him at 50mph, Preston Crown Court heard. Despite the driver slamming on the emergency brake, the train did not stop until after it had gone over McNeil, leaving the traumatised driver sure he was dead. Astonishing escape: William McNeil, 51, survived after a train went over him near these tracks outside Blackburn station . Astonishingly, though, the intoxicated man had survived with merely a cut to the head.  Later, when police asked him how drunk he was on a scale of one to 10, he replied: '11'. Details of McNeil's escape emerged at court where he was jailed for 12 months after admitting obstructing an engine using the railway - an offence under the Malicious Damage Act of 1861. The incident occurred in June after train driver James Wilding spotted McNeil staggering onto the railway line ahead of him just outside Blackburn station. Mr Wilding sounded the horn to alert McNeil but the man - whom the court heard was drunk - ignored him, instead crossing one set of tracks before lying down in the middle of the track. Prosecutor Robert Elias said: 'The driver tried an emergency stop but he was travelling at 50mph and he didn’t succeed in stopping when he passed over the top of the defendant. 'The driver was quite sure he had killed him and went to investigate. He found blood but no corpse. 'Investigations were made and the conductor of the train said that he had seen a man run off. His head was covered in blood and was found walking in the road nearby.' Driver's trauma: Preston Crown Court heard how the driver of the Northern Rail train similar to this one tried to stop . McNeil was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital where he was said to be 'confused.' He was later interviewed at home at Blackburn and confessed to being drunk and was going to sleep on the tracks. He admitted: ‘I feel sorry for the train driver'. Mr Elias added: 'It is hard to imagine anybody putting themselves down on a track in front of a fast moving train without realising the possibility of death.' 'The driver was quite sure he had killed him... He found blood but no corpse' - Prosecutor Robert Elias . The court heard that the trauma of what Mr Wilding had gone through was 'probably his worst nightmare' on thinking that his train had killed the man. In mitigation defence counsel Rick Holland claimed his client was planning to take his on his own life. But passing sentence, Judge Stuart Baker said: 'I note there is no history of of mental illness and when you were arrested by the police you were clearly under the influence. 'The explanation for your actions was to the effect of: you didn’t know why you got onto the track and that you were very heavily intoxicated. 'You put the driver in the agonising position of having to apply the brakes as fast as he could and he knew he hadn’t stopped in time. 'As far as the driver was concerned his immediate thought was that there had been a fatal accident described as being the nightmare that any train driver would suffer. 'Usually anyone who ends up under a train ends up dead' - ASLEF union spokesman Andy Botham . 'It must have been absolutely awful for the driver to think that despite his efforts his train had killed someone who had chose to lay down on the track.' In a statement at the time of the incident, ASLEF train drivers’ union spokesman Andy Botham said: 'It is amazing that this man survived. 'Usually anyone who ends up under a train ends up dead or with dramatically life-changing injuries. It is traumatic [for the drivers] and I don’t think people consider the consequences of their actions.' He added: 'There are around 200 incidents on the track each year so drivers are going out there every day afraid of this happening to them. 'Many drivers have been involved in an incident then have to travel down the same stretch of track every day.'","William McNeil, 51, was lying on train tracks outside Blackburn station .

At least 19 companies face a major criminal investigation over claims they knew corrupt private detectives were breaking the law on their behalf, the Information Commissioner announced last night. Christopher Graham said the group of firms, which include those from the legal, financial, and insurance industries, will be probed over whether they breached data protection rules. He also said his review of evidence handed over by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) suggested a total of 125 suspected victims of privacy breaches. Astounded: Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs committee, said he was 'baffled' as to why the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) took so long to act . It is a key development in revelations about corrupt private eyes employed by non-media companies. Despite a criminal inquiry into the detectives themselves, at first nothing was done to examine whether their paymasters knew they were breaking the law. The scandal erupted when MPs discovered a list of 98 firms who had hired four private eyes jailed last year as part of Operation Millipede for ‘blagging’ private information, or acquiring it on false pretexts. Despite holding the list, and a vast array of evidence from the trial, Soca was accused of failing to investigate any wrongdoing. Comments: Tory MP and senior committee member James Clappison has said there are still many questions to be answered in the scandal . MPs on the home affairs select committee who discovered the existence of the list threatened to publish it, but backed down when Soca gave it to Mr Graham’s office. He launched a review, resulting in yesterday’s announcement. Soca had refused to name the firms because it was possible they knew nothing about the activities of investigators they had hired. Last night home affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was ‘baffled’ as to why the crime agency did nothing for years when it took the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) just two weeks to act. Mr Vaz said: ‘The Commissioner has kept his promise to Parliament and provided the information requested promptly and efficiently.I am, however, baffled that for over four years Soca failed to conduct a scoping exercise which has taken the ICO two weeks to complete.’ When the MPs took the list of 98 from Soca they agreed not to make it public. However, around 33 of the names on it have emerged. Mr Graham did not identify those under investigation, but said the 19 clients were a construction firm, two financial companies, five retailers, three insurance firms, four law firms, and one security company. The final three are private detective agencies who outsourced work. The ICO examined 31 Soca files, including invoices, letters, reports, notes and account details. Some of it dates back as far as 2001. Worryingly, 12 firms are no longer trading – so may have escaped investigation because of the delay. The ICO is looking for information on a further 11. Tory MP and senior committee member James Clappison said: ‘This begs many questions as to what has been happening over a period of years. ‘There are many questions that need to be answered.’","Christopher Graham says groups from financial and legal sectors involved .

Yale's hallowed halls of learning have been flush with gossip about a so-called 'poopertrator' after a student or students unknown began defecating on clean clothes in the laundry at Saybrook residential college. The matter was brought to campus officials' attention after a student brought physical evidence of the crime to the Saybrook Master Paul Hudak's office. According to the Yale Daily News, the pooper has been on the loose since early September, but it wasn't until student Lucy Fleming showed the evidence - her soiled laundry - to college authorities that Yale police joined the search. Dirty laundry: Ivy League it may be, but someone at Yale University is causing a stink . On September 7, Fleming went to Saybrook's laundry room to collect her clean washing from a dryer after it had already been urinated in the laundry earlier in the day. She had rewashed the clothes, but when she removed her clothing from the dryer she realized that they were covered in feces. 'I simultaneously wanted to throw up, cry and punch someone,' Fleming told the Yale Daily News. The serial-pooper quickly became the talk of Twitter, with students dubbing the trending scandal #poopgate2k13. It seems that while not engaged in intellectual pursuits, a person, almost certainly a Yale student, had been throwing food and urine into dryers for some weeks before Fleming's dryer discovery. The recent escalation to fecal matter has college residents watching their clothing for the entire dryer cycle, and some campus colleges fear a spate of copy-cat laundry poopers. Some students, however, are unconcerned about the nefarious laundry-soiler and 'Dirty Laundry' parties have been thrown around the university. Exclusive: Yale is one of the nation's most sought-after colleges . And others have taken a more academic approach to the issue. 'Leave it to YDN, Yale PD, and . the Yale administration to miss a work of art, even when it hits them . like a stinking pile of s**t. This is clearly an act of the avant-garde, not a criminal mind,' wrote a commenter on Yale Daily News, only identifying themselves as 'AnAlumnus'. 'Defying bourgeoisie standards of etiquette, and destabilizing the . hegemonic ""clean/dirty"" binary (which itself is underpinned and . constructed by hidden economic, racial, and gender ideologies) our . intrepid defecator (though perhaps we cannot assume that the artist . recycled his or her own byproduct) juxtaposes the filthy with the . sanitary, making the thought-provoking suggestion that we are all full . of it, always and at all times, even at our most pristine,' wrote the former student and consummate stirrer. According to the Yale Daily News, there have been at least four separate incidents involving human feces in the Saybrook laundry. 'We have asked our students not to leave their laundry unattended, the affected machines have been thoroughly disinfected, and we are actively seeking information about who the perpetrator might be,' Hudak told the News. Dryer disaster: Many students have had their clothing ruined by someone throwing food waste, urine and feces into the dryer with their clean clothes . Hudak also sent an email addressing the matter to students: . 'Dear Saybrugians,' he wrote. 'Someone has been doing weird, creepy, and (frankly) disgusting things in the Laundry Room. This must stop immediately. If you have observed something of this nature, or know who the perpetrator might be, please let me know. I can’t imagine why someone would do these things, but it has got to stop, and we will take measures to be sure it does.' Student Camille Fonseca told the Yale Daily News that students have been standing watch over the dryers to ensure their clothes don't get ruined, and that many students think the college should employ 24-hour security guards in the laundry. 'It’s ruining people’s quality of life,' she said. The search continues for the Yale poopertrator - and when he or she is found, the poop will surely hit the fan.","Someone at a Yale residential college has been throwing human feces into dryers with other people's clean clothing .

When the government shut down Tuesday after Congress couldn't pass a federal budget, many brought up the question of how our founding fathers would have reacted to such a stalemate. One thing's for sure - they wouldn't have wanted City Tavern to close. Called the 'most genteel tavern in America' by future-President John Adams, the original City Tavern was a popular hangout for the Founding Fathers. Sorry we're closed: City Tavern in Philadelphia has been forced to close and cancel more than 300 reservations with the government shutdown . Revolutionary restaurant: The original City Tavern was built in 1773 and became a popular haunt for America's Founding Fathers who dined here often when attending the First and Second Continental Congresses as well as the Constitutional Convention . The original tavern was demolished in 1854, but rebuilt in the 1970s for the Bicentennial and operates as a restaurant serving Colonial-era fare in the Old City section of Philadelphia. While the tavern is privately-operated, it has had to temporarily close because the building is owned by the U.S. National Parks Service and the restaurant is inside Independence National Historical Park. Because the national park has had to close, the restaurant was informed that it couldn't stay open. This came as a surprise to those at the restaurant, as City Tavern was allowed to stay open the last time there was a government shutdown,  17 years ago. Shuttered: City Tavern is located in Independence National Historical Park, left, and the building is owned by the parks service, which is why it has had to close.

Off-limits: Independence National Hall, left, and the Liberty Bell, right, are also inside the national park, and are not open to tourists visiting the city . 'We were somewhat shocked when we received the news today that we would have to close at 3pm,' Molly Yun, City Tavern's public relations director told NBC Philadelphia yesterday. 'Unfortunately, we're going to have to stay closed until the government reopens and our hands are tied.' The restaurant has had to cancel more than 300 reservations for the next four days, including a party of 200, which has made many patrons 'angry' and 'aggravated'. The restaurant estimates that they could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars if the shutdown continues into the weekend, and it may lead their staff to look for other work.","City Tavern in Philadelphia has had to close with the government shutdown because the building is owned by the parks service, and is inside Independence National Historical Park .

A dismembered body found underneath a Paris street belonged to a woman TV journalist, it emerged today. The macabre remains in a service duct are of Caroline Corvalan, 33, who broadcast from the Riviera resort of Cannes for the France 3 station. Detectives have now launched a murder investigation, and have appealed for anybody who knew her to come forward. Ms Corvalan, who was described by colleagues as someone who ‘loved life and journalism’, was reported missing on August 20th after not turning up for work. Last week, on September 24th, maintenance men examining a service duct underneath a street in the 18th arrondissement of Paris found Ms Corvalan’s decomposed torso. The journalist’s remains were so badly mutilated that she could only be identified by her fingerprints. In a further twist, Police said there had been a mysterious burglary at Ms Corvalan's nearby flat. A police source told Le Parisien newspaper: ‘On September 18th, one or more strangers went into her home to steal her phone, a digital tablet, a coat and her handbag.’ Family members keeping an eye on the . apartment while Ms Corvalan was away reported the theft, but . investigating officers were intrigued to see the ‘stolen’ camera . reappear a few days later. Macabre: Maintenance men examining a service duct underneath a street in the 18th arrondissement of Paris found Ms Corvalan's decomposed torso last week . ‘The camera is currently being examined, but for the moment we cannot explain this strange fact,’ said the police source. Ms Corvalan, who spoke English fluently, was known to have a troubled love life, and had been receiving treatment for ‘mood disorders’. A family statement about Ms Corvalan reads: ‘She had a huge heart and helped many homeless people. She suffered a lot in this life. She was such a lovely person, always sensitive and always spoke from the heart.’ Ms Corvalan, who is originally from the south of France, moved into television from print journalism in 2006. One ex colleague said she had recently suffered from ‘two romantic let downs’.","The body of Caroline Corvalan, 33, was found in a service duct .

It may only be the size of a matchbox, but it could pose a big threat to our native wildlife. A baby terrapin spotted in a British canal has sparked fears among conservationists that they may have been breeding during the hot summer. Their natural habitat is the hot, humid swamps of the US, so British waters are normally too cold for them to breed. But the Canal and River Trust says this year’s scorching weather could have provided ideal conditions for the reptile to multiply – which it says would be ‘a disaster’ for wildlife. 'Disaster': The baby terrapin spotted in Regent's Canal suggests there could have been a surge in breeding . In the wild, the reptiles eat native species such as frogs, fish, and ducklings. The charity said the young terrapin was discovered last week in Regent’s Canal near Marylebone, Central London. It is urging people to report any other sightings to establish whether they are breeding. The popularity of terrapins as pets peaked during the late Eighties and early Nineties thanks to the hit children’s TV cartoon series, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But many were dumped in rivers and canals after growing too big for the fish tanks in which they were kept. The EU banned the importation of terrapins to member states in 1997 over concerns of their impact on indigenous species when released into the wild.

Adults that have been freed by their owners can be seen in British inland waters, but it is highly unusual to see a hatchling. They can be kept as pets, but are only bred in captivity in Europe. Ecologist Paul Wilkinson, of the Canal and River Trust, said: ‘This could be bad news for conservation. 'We’ve been concerned that increasing temperatures associated with climate change would give terrapins the conditions they need to breed, something which could be a disaster for some native wildlife. ‘We’ve heard anecdotal reports that eggs had been laid. 'Now we’ve found this juvenile, the hunt is on to see if there are more, especially if they are displaying their egg teeth – a sign that they are recent hatchlings.’ He said towns and cities, which tend to reach higher temperatures in hot weather, were the most likely places to find any offspring, adding: ‘Terrapins need extremely warm, sustained weather, something we obviously experienced over the past few months. ‘It’s particularly noticeable in towns and cities which can become “heat islands” in the summer – which could explain this finding. ‘We’d be keen to hear from anyone who has spotted a match-box-sized terrapin. It would help us to determine that they are breeding.’ The baby was spotted by biology graduate Kevin Jarvis, who lives on a boat and has nicknamed it Ninja. He said: ‘We have quite a lot of wildlife by the boats, including about 20 adult terrapins, but this juvenile really stood out. 'You often see it basking on a piece of wood. I’ve been looking to see any more, as it’d be a sign of hatchings.’","Conservationists warn terrapins eat ducklings, frogs and fish in the wild .

A Chicago restaurant has raised eyebrows with its burger of the month for October, garnishing it with an unconsecrated communion wafer and a red wine reduction sauce. Kuma's Corner, a foodie destination with just a few tables, names its hamburgers after heavy metal bands. For October, the restaurant chose to name the burger after the Swedish band Ghost. Members of the band dress in religious robes and wear skeleton face makeup. Heavy stuff: The ghost burger includes slow-braised goat shoulder - and an unconsecrated communion wafer . It's in poor taste, says Jeff Young of New Orleans who runs the blog Catholic Foodie.'It's not, for us, the Eucharist,' Young said. 'However this wafer is a symbol. There's a cross on it. It's like taking a flag and burning a flag.' Luke Tobias, Kuma's Corner director of operations, said the restaurant never wanted to offend anyone. He said reaction has been a 'mixed bag,' but more positive than negative. 'There are people who are offended by it, but we're delighted to see that generally people seem to have a sense of humor,' Tobias said. Temple to the burger: Kuma's Corner in Chicago has a regular 'burger of the month' dedicated to heavy metal bands . The restaurant, which often plays loud heavy metal music, is a fan of Ghost, Tobias said. Young said he realizes the restaurant's burger is an homage and knows Kuma's Corner didn't intend to offend anyone. 'The Ghost' burger is selling well, Tobias said, because customers are curious about it. 'Hopefully people will have a good time with it - that's certainly what we're trying to do,' Tobias said.","Kuma's in Chicago dedicates a burger to a different heavy metal band each month .
