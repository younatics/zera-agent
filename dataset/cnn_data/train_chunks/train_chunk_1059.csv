"A Maine man has been charged with throwing his three-month-old son down a flight of stairs, causing a skull fracture. Authorities say 39-year-old William Lord Jr. was charged with aggravated assault and domestic violence assault on a child less than six-years-old, as well as domestic violence terrorizing. He was held in lieu of $5,000 cash bail following a court hearing Monday afternoon. Police say the child was unsecured in a car safety seat when the intoxicated Lord threw him down the stairs at about 3.30am Monday. Charged: William Lord Jr., 39, was charged with aggravated assault and domestic violence assault on a child less than six years old, as well as domestic violence terrorizing, for allegedly throwing his son down the stairs . The boy's mother took the child to the hospital where he was treated for skull fracture that is not considered life threatening. According to WLBZ2, Lord went to bed after his partner left the house. He was woken Tuesday morning by police, who called for him to come out of the house on a PA system. Lord came outside and was arrested. The child's mother, Ericka Melanson, 21, told police that Lord had recently been fired and was becoming increasingly difficult, according to The Portland Press Herald. She told police she feared Lord would have shot her if she didn't leave. 'Ericka advised that on several different occasions, William has made comments that if she brings police to the residence again, he will shoot the police and will feel bad for their families,' police wrote in an affidavit. Lord is being held in jail and it's unclear if he has a lawyer. Police said there was another child in the house that was not injured.","Incident occurred 3.30am Monday in Wayne, Maine .

"Former Scotland manager Andy Roxburgh is leaving his job as Sporting Director of the New York Red Bulls, the Major League Soccer club said on Monday. Roxburgh has been with the Red Bulls since November 2012. He was manager of Scotland from 1986 to 1993 and was then appointed UEFA's first technical director where he was charged with developing coaching across the continent, a position he held until moving to New York. During Roxburgh's time at the club, New York finished with the best regular season record in 2013 and reached the Eastern Conference final this season. Andy Roxburgh is looking for a new challenge after 'two wonderful seasons' with the New York Red Bulls . Roxburgh, pictured with Richard Gough (right), previously managed Scotland between 1986 to 1993 . 'After two wonderful seasons with this great club and with my contract at an end, it is time for me to move on to a new challenge,' said Roxburgh. 'When I came to New York, I was given the remit of raising professional standards on the sporting side and bringing success on the field. 'With the support of everyone at the club, I feel that these objectives have been achieved,' added the 71-year-old. The Red Bulls recently lost their top player, former Arsenal and France striker Thierry Henry who left the club after four and a half seasons.

"An 87-year-old man who cancelled a $2900 cruise because his sister was dying has been refused a refund because she was over 75 and not considered immediate family. Alex Fraser was due to set sail from Sydney on a 16-day cruise around the Pacific Islands on March 2. But the Wollongong resident was forced to cancel the America Holland cruise just two days before when his sister Jean Docherty, 81, was admitted to hospital with stomach cancer. High seas: Alex Fraser was forced to cancel his America Holland cruise from Sydney to the Pacific Islands on March 2 . Mr Fraser's sister died on March 5. Even though he had paid an extra $200 for Vero travel insurance to cover himself in case a relative became ill or died, his refund claim was rejected by the company due to a clause in the product disclosure statement. The policy defines the term 'relative' as an immediate family member under the age of 75. 'Do you think I would sit by the bedside of a strange woman watching her die if she wasn't genetically associated with me,' Mr Fraser told MailOnline. 'I was absolutely flabbergasted. How can (they) say something like that?' The 87-year-old was told he couldn't get a refund on the cruise even though his sister had died because she was over 75 . The grandfather of two provided a medical certificate and doctor's letter to prove Mrs Docherty had been in hospital but the claim was rejected purely based on her age. Vero wrote: 'We acknowledge the late Jean Docherty is your sister and would be considered a relative under the normal dictionary meaning of the word, (but) 'relative' is specifically defined within the policy wording'. 'Relative means an immediate family member… under the age of 75.' Vero's owner Suncorp is planning to overhaul its travel cover, according to the Daily Telegraph. 'We are about to launch a review and upgrade of our range of travel insurance policies, and the policy restrictions involved (in Mr Fraser's case) will definitely be a part of that review,' a spokesman said. While the company said they will discuss the matter with Mr Fraser, he said he hadn't had much luck to date. 'When you try to part a Scotsman with his money you're in trouble,' he said. The grandfather of two had planned the cruise back in December and was set on visiting Fiji and Vanuatu .","Alex Fraser, 87, cancelled his cruise in March when his sister fell ill .

"This is the dramatic moment a car burst into a ball of flames after thugs put a lit firework up the exhaust pipe. The Renault Megane became engulfed in flames after the firework went off inside the exhaust while the vehicle was parked on the high street in Earls Colne, Essex. The force of the explosion and subsequent fire was so fierce it shattered the windows of nearby shops and homes, causing tens of thousands of pounds worth of damage. The Renault Megane became engulfed in flames after yobs put a lit firework inside the exhaust pipe of the vehicle on the high street in Earls Colne, Essex. Firefighters spent 50 minutes trying to put out the blaze . The force of the explosion caused windows of nearby shops and homes to shatter amid fears the fire would spread. A father and his two children had to evacuate their flat but firefighters managed to control the blaze . A father and his two young children were forced to evacuate their flat in the quiet village amid fears the fire would rip through nearby buildings. Firefighters spent more than 50 minutes trying to put out the flames and stop them spreading to nearby properties during the incident on Saturday night. Fire crews said the buildings within close range to the burning vehicle would have caught alight if the blaze had raged for another five minutes. Colin Abbott, owner of Abco insurance and financial services which had its windows blown out in the incident, said: 'It was a blessing nobody has been hurt. 'We have been here 25 years and it is heart-breaking to see the damage but the main concern was the man and two children upstairs.' Mr Abbott said residents phoned him to tell him about the blaze, enabling him to rush back to his shop. He said: 'It is a 12th century building and it could have been horrendous. 'The people who did this probably did not understand the extent of what they have done. The blaze completely damaged the Megane and caused thousands of pounds worth of damage to nearby shops . Workers from Abco Financial Services, the shop also severely damaged by the blaze (pictured behind the vehicle), assess the extent of the damage caused by the explosion as police issue warnings to firework users . 'They had what was effectively a bomb and in the wrong hands and in the wrong place it could be deadly. 'It has caused tens of thousands of pounds damage.' Totteridge Gallery, next to Mr Abbott's shop, was also damaged when the Megane went up in flames. Essex Police said the force had been informed of the incident and urged members of the public who suspect people of using fireworks dangerously to contact police. A spokesman said: 'The public should be are aware of the dangers of using fireworks outside of a controlled environment. 'They can cause serious injury and damage to property.'","Car erupted into ball of flames after being targeted by thugs in Essex village .

"University of Florida freshman quarterback Treon Harris has been suspended from the team while authorities investigate claims he sexually assaulted a female student. The 19-year-old true freshman stands accused of assaulting an unidentified peer in a campus dorm at 12:49am Sunday morning - just hours after leading the Gators to victory at the University of Tennessee. According to the Gainesville university campus' crime log, the only incident of sexual battery this week happened at the Springs Residential complex and was reported on Monday. Out of play: University of Florida freshman quarterback Treon Harris has been suspended from the football team following allegations he sexually assaulted a female student. Pictured above in Saturday's game against the University of Tennessee . Scene: According to the Gainesville university campus' crime log, the only incident of sexual battery this week happened at the Springs Residential complex and was reported on Monday. The dorm in question pictured above . Accusations: Harris stands accused of assaulting an unidentified female student in a campus dorm early Sunday morning. Pictured above signing his letter of intent to attend Florida last February . A source told Florida Today that the investigation may take several weeks, so its unlikely the athlete will be back on the field in this weekend's game against Louisiana State University. No charges have been filed, and as of Monday Harris had not been arrested. He has since taken his Twitter profile down. 'We are representing him and we are cooperating with the investigation,' his attorney Huntley Johnson said. 'I am hopeful that he will never be arrested [regarding this case].' Florida head coach Will Muschamp postponed his regular Monday press conference in light of the charges, and the university confirmed the report in a written statement . 'We have no tolerance for sexual assault on our campus,' UF President Bernie Machen said in a statement released by the school. 'The university is committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for every member of the UF community. We must strive to protect all of our students from sexual harassment and assault, and do everything in our power to promote a safe learning environment,' he added. The Gainesville police have been called in to assist campus police with the investigation, in collecting and analyzing forensic evidence. The 5-foot-11, 190-pound Harris replaced starting quarterback Jeff Drisken in the lineup for the game against Tennessee, and helped lead the team to a 10-9 victory. His suspension puts the team at a disadvantage going into next weekend's game against LSU, since reserve quarterback Will Grier has been sidelined for three weeks due to back spasms. Harris made his debut with the Gators in the September 6 blowout against Eastern Michigan University. He graduated from Booker T Washington High School in Miami, where he helped lead the squad to a Class 4A championship in 2012 and 2013. Monday's allegations come a year afters similar accusations were brought up against the quarterback of rival Florida State University, Jameis Winston. Heisman Trophy-winner Winston was able to continue playing because formal charges were never filed.

"Alan Pardew fears goalkeeper Rob Elliot will miss the entire festive programme after suffering a torn thigh muscle.

"Rafa Benitez praised his Napoli side for fighting back to earn a 2-2 draw against Empoli on Sunday, but expressed frustration that they fell two goals behind in the first place. Empoli looked to be on course for their third win in four Serie A games when Simone Verdi gave them a first-half lead before team-mate Daniele Rugani made it 2-0 eight minutes after the restart. However, the hosts staged a comeback with Duvan Zapata reducing the deficit in the 67th minute before substitute Jonathan de Guzman made it 2-2 shortly after. Jonathan de Guzman celebrates scoring during Napoli's 2-2 draw against Empoli . The stalemate at the Stadio San Paolo means fourth-placed Napoli have now drawn their last three league matches to fall 11 points behind leaders Juventus, and while Benitez hailed his side's character in rescuing a point he is frustrated by their sloppy start to the match. 'The character that the team showed in the second half is positive, but I'm not happy because I want to see this attitude from the first minute,' Benitez told Napoli's official website. 'Do not judge this result well because the draw at home is not a positive result. The reaction of the team, however, has been very positive and at the end we might also have won against a team that we knew were playing well.' Napoli boss Rafa Benitez has praised his side for coming from behind to draw agaist Empoli . Benitez called on his side to start matches brightly in the future so they can begin to convert draws into victories. 'This does not mean that I am satisfied because if I liked the reaction, I did not like the second part of the first half where we made the mistake that allowed Empoli to score,' the Spaniard added. 'We have to score more goals and clearly concede fewer.

"An American doctor caught Ebola while working for the World Health Organization in Sierra Leone has been released from an Atlanta hospital after conquering the disease - nearly six weeks after he was flown back to the US for treatment. The doctor's name was kept closely guarded and out of the public record while he was being treated in Atlanta since September 9. Hospital officials said man was released Monday 'to an undisclosed location' Sunday from Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, after he was determined to be free of the virus and no threat to the public. The man clung to his anonymity even as he neared a full recovery last week. Scroll down for video . Still anonymous: The unnamed healthcare worker who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone before spending the last six and a half weeks at Emory University Hospital has gone home 'to an undisclosed location' and retained his anonymity . 'As a result of the virus, my condition worsened and I became critically ill soon after I arrived at Emory,' the unnamed man said in statement. He continued: 'Through rigorous medical treatment, skillful nursing, and the full support of a health-care team, I am well on the way to a full recovery.' 'I want the public to know that although Ebola is a serious, complex disease, it is possible to recover and return to a healthy life. 'I wish to retain my anonymity for now, but I anticipate sharing more information in future weeks as I complete my recovery.' The man was transported to the hospital on September 9 after arriving in Atlanta on a jet. The World Health Organization disclosed that a doctor who had been working in an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone had been evacuated out of Africa when he tested positive for the disease. The unnamed healthcare worker was in Sierra Leone when he contracted the disease before being flown back to the U.S. for treatment in Atlanta. Some 1,200 hundred people have died from Ebola in the West African nation . However, hospital and health officials never released his name, in keeping with his family's wish for privacy. Emory is one of four U.S. hospitals with specialized treatment units for people with highly dangerous infectious diseases. The others are in Maryland, Nebraska and Montana. In a statement last week, the unidentified patient said that his condition worsened shortly after he arrived at Emory and that for a while he was critically ill. His time at Emory - nearly six weeks - is the longest stay of an Ebola patient at a U.S. hospital. None of the seven others was admitted for more than 3 1/2 weeks. In August, Emory treated two U.S. aid workers who were infected in Liberia and evacuated to Atlanta. Both were released from the unit within three weeks. Emory is also treating a nurse, Amber Joy Vinson, who was infected at a Dallas hospital while treating a visitor from Liberia. She arrived last week. Emory officials did not provide a condition report on her Monday. Amber Vinson (left), the second Dallas nurse diagnosed with Ebola after contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, is now the single Ebola patient receiving care at Emory.

"Jak Alnwick’s senior career was less than 60 seconds old when he landed a knee in Diego Costa’s back and his fist on the ball. Twenty minutes earlier the rookie goalkeeper had been an unknown, sat in the dugout at St James’ Park having never made a professional appearance – he didn’ t even have a Wikipedia page. Come full-time, the 21-year-old – thrust into the action as a half-time replacement for the injured Rob Elliot – was trending on Twitter, had given a live interview on national television and, more importantly, had made a string of saves to ensure Newcastle became the first team to beat Chelsea this season. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Jak Alnwick, on debut for Newcastle, makes a confident punch while being held by Diego Costa . Alnwick, 21, was called upon in the second half after Rob Elliott was injured and unable to continue . It was the Premier League platform which Alnwick – who had only ever made a handful of appearances during a loan spell at Gateshead - had craved, as manager Alan Pardew revealed: ‘Before Tim Krul got injured Jak came to see me and said he was disappointed in my management of him – that the club had let him down by not loaning him out. ‘But we couldn’t because he was our third choice and we couldn’t put him at risk. His contract is up at the end of the year and he felt he hadn’t been given a chance. ‘I said to Andy Woodman, our goalkeeping coach, you have to admire him. He wasn’ t really in a position to bang the door down on me – we had won four games on the trot. But fair play to him.’ Alnwick - younger brother of former Sunderland and Spurs stopper Ben - will now make his first senior start at Arsenal next weekend. And Pardew has no worries about keeping faith with the young custodian, whose best save was a reflex tip to thwart Costa in the 89th minute after he had earlier floored the same player. Alnwick dives to his left to make a save during Newcastle's surprise win against Chelsea on Saturday . The young keeper was helpless as Didier Drogba rose highest to head home Chelsea's only goal . ‘Costa is a big guy, I was stood next to him in the tunnel. He’s a huge unit of a centre-forward. For Jak to put him on the floor was pretty impressive,’ he said. ‘It’s very unusual for a third-choice goalie to have the aura that he gave out. He was calm. For me on the sideline that gave me reassurance, I like my goalies to have that feel. ‘Jak is a North-East hero today – I have no problems saying that.’ Pardew added: ‘Jak knew that Robbie has been struggling, but we kept that quiet. He’s had a strain and hasn’t really trained. ‘He was half prepared, but we could not have been prepared for how cool he was. He took it in his stride. I have to pay a massive tribute to him. Alnwick embraces coach John Carver after Newcastle's massive 2-1 win over Cheslea . ‘He will be in goal at Arsenal now. He was great.’ Alnwick, though, admits there were one or two nerves as he went through a warm-up routine during the interval. ‘I was a little bit nervous but it was slightly easier coming on at half-time because I didn't have time to think about it too much,’ he said. ‘It was a great experience for me and I'm just happy to get the victory. Everyone backed me and showed me great support, the gaffer, the backroom staff, everyone.’","Jak Alnwick, 21, came on for the second half to replace Rob Elliott .

"The NFL is serving up a full slate of pigskin action on Thursday while many fans in the US will be tucking into their Thanksgiving turkeys. The league decided to go back to the basics this year and all three Thanksgiving tilts will feature divisional rivals from the NFC facing off in match-ups with major implications for the postseason... Chicago Bears vs Detroit Lions . 5:30pm, live on Sky Sports . Philadelphia Eagles vs Dallas Cowboys . 9:30PM live on Sky Sports . Seattle Seahawks vs San Francisco 49ers . 1:30am, live on Sky Sports . In the first game of the day, the Chicago Bears  travel about 270 miles east for a game at Ford Field in Detroit against the Lions. The Bears roll into Motown riding a two-game winning streak and have seemingly righted the ship after they allowed more than 50 points in two consecutive losses to the New England Patriots and Green Bay Packers. Chicago got two touchdowns from running back Matt Forte during a 21-13 win over Tampa Bay on Sunday and the Bears defense recorded a season-high five sacks. Much-maligned quarterback Jay Cutler didn't have a great day at the office (17 completions, 130 yards, one touchdown), but he didn't turn the ball over and let the running game and defense take control. It would be surprising if Cutler was able to turn in another turnover-free performance against the Lions on Thursday. Jay Cutler has enjoyed back-to-back victories and the Bears are playing Detroit at the right time . Matt Forte was the key to Chicago's win against former coach Lovie Smith's Tampa Bay . Detroit limps into the home game after getting outclassed by the Arizona Cardinals and the Patriots and their top-tier defense will be playing with extra motivation after surrendering 34 points in New England on Sunday. Cutler is no stranger to turning the ball over and Detroit will likely get after him early and often to limit his ability to throw downfield. The Lions offense, which has been limited to five field goals and only 15 points during the last two games, also needs to get back on track and Chicago is seemingly the perfect opponent to do that against. Detroit's passing attack should have no problem making mashed potatoes out of Chicago's 29th-ranked secondary and wide receivers Golden Tate and Calvin Johnson will be gobbling up the yards in bunches. Johnson has scored in six of the seven career games he has played on Thanksgiving and averaged nearly five catches and 70 receiving yards against the Bears throughout his career so there's a fairly good chance he'll be rolling like a gravy train with biscuit wheels on Thursday. Ndamukong Suh leads the Lions' rejuvenated defense, which is third overall in the NFL . Golden Tate was an inspired addition in free agency and already has 1,047 yards to his name . During the second game of the day, the 8-3 Philadelphia Eagles travel to Dallas to take on the 8-3 Cowboys in a battle for first place in the NFC East. Both teams are coming off big wins  and Thursday is the first of two meetings the teams will have in the next three weeks. The Eagles have been slightly better on offense and Dallas has been a shade better on defense thus far, but the teams are fairly evenly-matched and this game should provide a cornucopia of excitement. As is often the case in the NFL, this game will likely come down to quarterback play. Philadelphia's Mark Sanchez will make his fourth start in a row for injured Nick Foles while Tony Romo will be back under center for the third straight game after sitting out for a week because of a back injury. Mark Sanchez (right) celebrates victory over the Titans with former Jets team-mate Shonn Greene . LeSean McCoy has 879 yards this season, and is making up for lost time after a slow start . Sanchez has filled in admirably for Foles with seven touchdowns and three consecutive 300-yard passing games, but he has tossed six interceptions. He's also had his struggles on Thanksgiving in the past - think butt fumble - and the Cowboys may want to force the former Jet to make plays while focusing their efforts on shutting down LeSean McCoy and Darren Sproles in the running game. The 'Boys aren't great at creating turnovers, but Sanchez will almost certainly toss a pick or two. On the other hand, Romo is usually good for an interception or two of his own, or least he has been in the past. However Dallas' reliance on DeMarco Murray and its running game has allowed Romo to relax a bit in the pocket and he has responded favourably. The veteran signal-caller has 22 touchdowns and only six interceptions this year and that ratio is the biggest reason why his quarterback rating sits at 80.5, the best mark of his ten-year career. Romo hasn't thrown an interception in more than a month and has seven scores in his last two games. The Eagles will probably get to him at some point, but the Cowboys should be able to stuff Sanchez and serve Philadelphia its first road loss of the year. Tony Romo hands off to DeMarco Murray in an all-too familiar sight this year - he has 268 carries . The first two games of the day should be good, but football fans will want to have their popcorn, or pumpkin pie, ready for the evening game at Levi's Stadium. When the 49ers last played the Seahawks ten months ago for the NFC Championship, the game ended with Seattle stopping a late San Francisco drive to advance to the Super Bowl. It ended with a play in the end zone that caused a beef between Richard Sherman and Michael Crabtree that is still going and made the feisty defensive back a legit star. There was also the whole Erin Andrews situation which resulted out of that game and head coaches Jim Harbaugh and Pete Carroll don't pretend to like one another. In addition to Thursday's game being a rehashing of all those trimmings, there's also a good chance the losing team won't be headed to the playoffs. The emergence of the Cardinals atop the division means that Seattle and San Francisco are likely battling for a single spot in the postseason. The teams do play each other again in Week 15 and the winner on Thanksgiving will have a big advantage heading into that match-up because of the earlier head-to-head victory. Both teams will enter Thursday with 7-4 records but one will emerge at 7-5, a mark which would not currently be good enough for a wildcard spot. Colin Kaepernick and the 49ers will be out for revenge as they meet Seattle for the first time this season . Richard Sherman and the rest of the Legion of Boom limited the Cardinals to just three points in a 19-3 win . Despite a schism with head coach Pete Carroll, Marshawn Lynch keeps pounding away for the Seahawks . Seattle has not displayed the same level of play that won them the Super Bowl last season, but the team is still near the top of the league in defense and their running game ranks best in the NFL. Quarterback Russell Wilson has been able to make up for shortcomings in Seattle's passing game by beating teams with his feet and the Seahawks have won four of its last five games after a rocky start to the year. San Francisco have won three in a row but the team has struggled against quality opponents  and this will be a huge test for them. The 49ers barely squeaked by a fairly terrible Washington team  and quarterback Colin Kaepernick's play was inconsistent at best. He has only thrown for 300 or more yards once this season and simply has not done enough to justify the massive contract he signed during the offseason. That said, if Kaepernick can provide a San Francisco treat and help the 49ers eke out a win against the Seahawks the deal will look as if it's worth every penny.","Lions should make turkeys out of the Bears during Thursday matinee in Detroit .

"Jimmy Bullard has slammed ITV for editing him into a bully during his time in I'm a Celebrity 2014. Speaking about the 'banter' with fellow contestant Jake Quickenden after Bullard's exit from the jungle, the former Wigan midfielder said: 'I've seen that [footage] back and it was totally tongue in cheek. The way that came across on TV was totally not how it came across in camp. 'The best person to answer that is Jake. We're great friends and we're going to be for a long time. It was total banter. Scroll down for video . Jimmy Bullard believes he was made to look like a bully because of the way I'm A Celebrity edited the scenes . He added: 'Let me tell you, he gave as good as he took. Saying that, I can be a bit of a nightmare. Bullard also says that because viewers only saw a short amount of time on a daily basis, they didn't see how playful they were with each other in the jungle. 'I can see how it can come across as harsh for the punters to watch – but in our little bubble it was just banter,' he added. When asked why he think he was evicted first, Bullard admitted: 'I haven't got a clue why I've gone, I've seen some clips and have seen how different it can show you. The ex-footballer said Jake Quickenden was just as rude with his banter on the show but viewers didn't see it . 'When you are in there 24/7 it's so different and it's something you can't affect. Obviously I wasn't voted for enough.' Despite being voted out first, Jimmy still says that he loved being on the show. 'What an experience! I'm so glad that I came here and did the show,' the ex-footballer said. 'It was mad. I was in there with a great bunch, but that's exactly what you wish for. 'To be fair, they were a mad bunch – but I loved everything about it. In a way, it's lovely to be out. I was loving it in there and I wanted to stay a little longer, but I'm out and that's it.' Bullard hopes he's made long-lasting friendships with Carl 'Foggy' Fogarty and Quickenden . But saying goodbye to Carl 'Foggy' Fogarty was tough for the former sportsman. 'Watching Foggy on screen crying make me nearly cry. You bond in there. Spending time with 24/7 with someone is like spending a couple of years with someone,' Jimmy said. 'When he broke down, I was like, 'Ah Fog, don't do this to me on TV.' I totally went. He's a great friend and along with Jake, I know I've got two friends for life. But I was close to them all. I couldn't have asked for a better bunch.' Bullard was forced to retire from football at the age of 29 following a series of injuries . Despite going out first, Bullard said he had a great experience on the show .","Jimmy Bullard hits out at ITV for making him look like a bully during I'm a Celebrity 2014 .

"A cardiologist has been found to have prescribed and administered morphine to a teenage colleague that he was dating. Dr Paul Langton, who became a registered practitioner in 1990, had formed an intimate relationship with an 18-year-old woman who worked at his hospital after she came to him for treatment in late 2010. The Medical Board of Australia condemned his treatment as inappropriate due to the woman's 'history of illicit drug use', fining him $30,000 and suspending him from practice for 18 months. Dr Paul Langton, a cardiologist at Hollywood Private Hospital in Perth, will be suspended from practice for 18 months and has been fined $30,000 . Based in Perth at Hollywood Private Hospital, Dr Langton treated and advised the woman from late 2010 until mid 2011. This included injecting her with morphine and writing prescriptions for injectable ampoules of morphine sulphate as a treatment for her chronic low back pain. The Medical Board of Australia wrote that the doctor's first recommendations should have been 'mild analgesia, appropriate exercise and referral to a physiotherapist'. It  found that the administration of morphine was entirely inappropriate due to the woman's 'history of illicit drug use, binge drinking and anxiety and depression increased the risk of addiction and inappropriate use of morphine'. However, the board's overall ruling stated that the duo's intimate relationship, 'compromised [Mr Langton's] ability to provide proper medical advice and treatment' to the woman. The board also heard Dr Langton was suffering from depression during his relationship with the teen and ruled that this played a 'significant part in him making the errors of judgment he did in advising and treating her'. He was found to have been treating an 18-year-old colleague that he had formed an intimate relationship with. This included prescribing and administering her with morphine despite her history of illicit drug use . It was also revealed that he had taken sedatives from his work place, including Propofol, Midazolam and Fentanyl, to help him sleep. Dr Langton told the ABC that he had reported himself to the board, which stated that he 'admits that he behaved in a way that constitutes professional misconduct'. He was fined $30,000 and will be suspended from practice for 18 months as of November 21. The board's ruling also requires him to undergo assessment by a psychiatrist every four months and a psychologist every three months.","Dr Paul Langton formed an intimate relationship with 18-year-old colleague .

"David De Gea has been a rock in Manchester United's shaky defence during a difficult first five months for Louis van Gaal's new-look side, says former Old Trafford legend Peter Schmeichel. De Gea, who signed from Altetico Madrid for £18.9million in 2011, had a difficult start to life with United with many criticising the Spaniard for some shaky early displays between the posts. De Gea, however, has excelled for United in recent seasons and has been consistently excellent behind a questionable defence hit by injuries to key players such as Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Luke Shaw and without the experienced trio of Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra who all moved on during the summer.

And Schmeichel, who played eight seasons for United, believes De Gea has proven himself to be Van Gaal's most reliable player during the current campaign. 'He's doing really well,' Schmeichel told goal.com. I think he's the only player in the squad who performs consistently every time. Last season he was the only player who consistently brought any kind of quality to Manchester United. 'Last season was good for him. He won the championship in the year before but there was still this doubt about him and I think he washed that away with his performances.' After a disastrous start to the season, including a 5-3 humiliation at Leicester City in September, Van Gaal's has steadied the ship in recent weeks with United winning their last five Premier League games on the trot. Liverpool's Yossi Benayoun shoots past De Gea (left) during his time with Atletico Madrid back in 2010 . Recent wins over Crystal Palace, Arsenal, Hull, Stoke City and Southampton have propelled United up to third in the table. 'That's how you win championships. That's how you qualify for the Champions League,' the Dane added. 'Last season, as soon as they came under pressure and went behind, they would lose the game which is very unlike Manchester United. 'To get results and play the way they played against Southampton and win that game, it was hugely important. 'At no point in that game were they impressive but that was the kind of game they would lose last season so that's a very big positive.'

"Jose Mourinho has revealed that Diego Costa will be fit to face Sunderland on Saturday despite picking up a 'knock' during Chelsea's 5-0 win against Schalke. Despite not being able to find the net in Germany, Costa put in another impressive display before being replaced by Blues veteran Didier Drogba in the 66th minute.

"Edinson Cavani scored twice and Zlatan Ibrahimovic got his first club goal for nearly three months as Paris Saint-Germain overcame a second-half wobble to beat Ajax 3-1 in the Champions League. PSG stay one point ahead of Barcelona in Group F before they meet at the Nou Camp in two weeks' time. Both teams had already qualified before Tuesday's games.

Subs not used: Moisander, Sigthorsson, Riedewald, El Ghazi, Boer . Goals: Klaassen . Booked: Klaassen . With Ajax gaining in confidence, PSG weathered a spell of pressure before Ibrahimovic soothed the nerves with an expertly-taken goal in the 78th. Five minutes later, Cavani profited from a poor back pass to round Netherlands goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen and slot home. PSG did not test Ajax's defense until midway through the first half, when Ibrahimovic released Ezequiel Lavezzi with down the right and the Argentina winger's shot was kicked away by Cillessen. Ibrahimovic then headed over from six yards (meters) following a corner, but PSG's pressure finally told when Lavezzi went clean through and unselfishly squared the ball to Cavani, who rolled it into the empty net. Ibrahimovic has only recently returned after nearly two months out with a heel injury and his enthusiasm to be back playing again got the better of him at times. Late in the first half, he was shown a yellow card for a thudding late challenge on Thulani Serero that sent the midfielder flying up in the air. Just like in the away game in September, which finished 1-1, PSG was in control for the first hour before an alarming dip in concentration. Ajax's equalizer came after a neat passing move. PSG's players just sat back and watched as Ajax put a few passes together in midfield, before spreading the ball left. Given time to look up, and under no pressure, 19-year-old winger Ricardo Kishna whipped in a perfect cross and Klaassen's header flashed past goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu.

VIDEO Ibra looks to Barca showdown . Ajax pushed forward and midfielder Lasse Schone clipped a free kick just over. A minute later, Ibrahimovic showed just why defenders should never lose sight of him. Collecting a bouncing pass from Javier Pastore on the right of the penalty area, the imposing Sweden forward cushioned it brilliantly and then arched his body to plant a diagonal shot into the bottom corner. He had not scored for PSG since a hat trick against Saint-Etienne on Aug. 31. Cavani's second goal was much simpler, as he ran onto a misjudged pass from Ajax midfielder Niki Zimling and finished confidently. In the end it was a subdued and comfortable end to what was shaping up as a fiery encounter, at least in the stands. Ibrahimovic hands his captain's armband to Javier Pastore as he's substituted in the 86th minutes on Tuesday . After nearly 100 Ajax supporters were arrested in Paris the night before there was a strong police presence to prevent potential trouble between fans before the game. Police say 95 fans, who were all Dutch, were arrested and detained on Monday night because they were armed, and had not been allowed to travel to the game. PSG hooligans have a history of violence with their Dutch counterparts and police feared they would arrange fights before kick-off late Tuesday. About three hours before the game, a group of Ajax fans was seen gathered in a small street near Saint-Michel square in Paris' historical centre surrounded by a group of riot police. Another squad of riot police blocked off the other end of the street near to where a group of PSG supporters was gathering. Police also surrounded the metro station at Odeon, which fans traditionally use to travel to the Parc des Princes stadium. Six years ago, thugs from PSG and Dutch club FC Twente had clashed on the same street off Saint-Michel square hours before a UEFA Cup match, and last season hooligans from PSG and Bayer Leverkusen clashed on the platform at Odeon station. Only 850 Ajax fans have been authorized to travel to the French capital under supervision of police forces. Police said the 95 fans arrested in downtown Paris were armed with iron sticks and knuckledusters, with ski masks later found in the bars where they were gathered. Of those arrested Monday night, police released 41 supporters overnight while 54 remained in custody on Tuesday.","Edinson Cavani struck after 32 minutes to open the scoring for Paris Saint-Germanin .

"Marco Reus has suffered another injury set-back after he was carried off midway through the second half during Borussia Dortmund's league clash with Paderborn. Dortmund's sporting director Michael Zorc told the club's website that Reus could have suffered 'a lateral ankle ligament rupture' according to the team doctor's initial diagnosis. 'It is very difficult to process the fact that Marco Reus could again be ruled out, more difficult than dealing with the draw,' Jurgen Klopp said after Dortmund squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2.

Paderborn's Marvin Bakalorz was booked after his trip left Reus clutching his ankle in pain . The club said they did not expect to have a full diagnosis until at least Sunday, but Reus' latest injury will have sent warning signs over his fragility to Premier League clubs including Chelsea and Manchester City who are tracking the winger. Germany international Reus, who also missed the World Cup with an ankle injury and suffered a minor injury earlier in November, started the game and scored Dortmund's second goal on the stroke of half-time. He had to be taken off on a stretcher in the 67th minute after former Dortmund player Marvin Bakalorz, who was booked, slid in and clipped his right ankle in a rough challenge - which left Klopp furious. 'There are situations where he makes sliding tackles without any control whatsoever. I used to tell him that he shouldn't do that. Marvin is a great lad, but that was just too much,' he said. Bakalorz said: 'Klopp screamed at me and rightly so.' Dortmund travel to Arsenal for their Champions League group game next week.

"Cristiano Ronaldo made it 20 league goals by November in Real Madrid’s 4-0 win over Eibar – no wonder Carlo Ancelotti could be seen imitating his top scorer’s goal celebration on the touchline. As Ronaldo made 20 goals in 12 games Real Madrid made it 14 straight victories taking Ancelotti to within one of Jose Mourinho’s record 15-win run at the club. He could draw level on Wednesday against Basel in the Champions League with a victory that would also give Liverpool a helping hand in Group B. Ronaldo, who scored in both halves is well on course to smash Lionel Messi's record of 50 goals in the 2011-12 season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Eibar 0-4 Real Madrid .

Goals: Rodriguez 23, Ronaldo 43, 83, Benzema 69 . Booked: Ramos 21, Rodriguez 42 . When he got the second goal of the game and performed his chest-out arms-outstretched ‘here I am’ celebration, Ancelotti could be seen copying it in the technical area, much to the amusement of his coaching staff. This was always going to be tough for Eibar whose 16m budget for their entire squad wouldn’t pay Ronaldo’s salary. They started brightly but were gradually undone by Real Madrid’s 300m forward line. Madrid could have taken the lead on seven minutes when Gareth Bale dipped a vicious free-kick from 30-yards out and Eibar keeper Xabi Irueta did well to adjust his position to tip the ball over. When the first goal came it was controversial with two possible claims for offside. Ronaldo crossed to Karim Benzema who looked offside as he tried to poke it past Irueta. His shot ran back out to Ronaldo who, now also looked offside as this time, he picked out James Rodriguez at the back post, and the Colombian headed home. Eibar had a chance to equalize when Ander Capa found Saul Berjon and only a fine save from Iker Casillas kept Madrid ahead. Ronaldo then got his name on the scoresheet when Bale and Carvajal cominbed down the right and from Carvajal’s cross Ronaldo found the bottom corner. He has now scored in his last 11 league games. Leo Messi once scored in 21 straight matches but on this form you wouldn’t back against Ronaldo beating that record too. In the second half Benzema made it 3-0 converting Rodriguez’s cross into the roof of Irueta’s net. Eibar players complained that the ball had gone out of play when the Colombian hooked it back across the face of the goal for Benzema to finish. Ronaldo then got the fourth from the spot to complete the rout. It was an impressive performance from Madrid in their first game without Luka Modric who will be out for three months with a tendon injury in his left thigh. Despite his absence Arsenal target Sami Khedira was still left on the bench just a month from being able to negotiate a free transfer away from the club. The result kept Real Madrid on top of the table. They had overcome a potentially tricky international break game, winning their first league encounter ever in Ipurua.

"Click here for stats, heat maps and more! Jose Mourinho must have been taking notes when Brazil manager Dunga visited Chelsea’s Cobham training ground for lunch on Friday. For there was certainly an air of the legendary Brazil sides about Chelsea as they took apart West Bromwich Albion at Stamford Bridge — in the first half, at least. Two of their starting XI were Brazilian — Oscar and Willian — and Diego Costa was born there before switching allegiances to represent Spain. All three were integral to this punishing, pin-point passing performance. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Chelsea 2-0 West Brom .

Costa got Chelsea on their way to a comfortable three points against West Brom in the Premier League match . Jose Mourinho kept Chelsea's unbeaten start to the season intact against West Brom with the comfortable 2-0 win .

Ratings by Robert Treasure . ‘Beautiful,’ was the word used by Mourinho to sum up his side’s first- half display. ‘The quality of our football was high,’ he said. ‘We were playing so well, so fast, so fluid. 'We made the pitch very wide. We create spaces to play inside. We scored two goals, we should score much more than that. It was fantastic.’ Indeed, the great Brazil side which won the 1970 World Cup in Mexico would have been proud of a move of the highest calibre that led to the opening goal on 11 minutes. Oscar exchanged a tidy one-two with Willian down the left-hand side and then passed the ball to Cesar Azpilicueta on the overlap. The full-back played the ball back to Oscar who sent in a cross as nonchalantly as you like which Diego Costa controlled with his chest before finishing for his 11th Premier League goal of the campaign. Only 25 minutes in and Chelsea were two ahead, although it could have been four or five at that point were it not for Ben Foster’s form in Albion’s goal. A simpler move, but as equally clever as the first, doubled the lead. Oscar played a corner from the left along the ground straight to Eden Hazard, who took one touch to take the ball around Craig Gardner before burying a low finish. Four minutes later, West Brom’s afternoon became considerably worse when Claudio Yacob was shown a straight red card by referee Lee Mason for jumping in to challenge Costa. At this point, West Brom manager Alan Irvine feared the worst. ‘There’s been an 8-0 in the league this season and when you’re 2-0 down with 10 men at Stamford Bridge with most of the game to play, you fear the worst,’ he said. ‘It was important to get my players focused and make sure we didn’t end up on the wrong end of a high score.’ But Chelsea were already running the show as if they had a man advantage before the sending off.

The Brazilian Football Confederation said ‘there was a long conversation, with an exchange of ideas about football’ when Dunga met Mourinho. Yet Chelsea’s players were making the most complex football ideas appear simple on the pitch . Oscar struck an outside-of-the-boot curler from the edge of the box on 15 minutes, which Foster dived to keep out before smothering a Costa effort who had pounced on the rebound. Moments later and he was at it again. Oscar, seemingly everywhere on the pitch and this time on the right, reached the byline before passing back to Branislav Ivanovic. The full-back’s first-time cross was met by Costa, who tried to side-foot home but the ball flew across goal and went wide of a post. Still wave after wave of blue roared towards West Brom’s goal. Hazard sent a ball over the top, which Costa managed to control only for Foster to come hurtling out to block, then react fastest to punch the ball away from Oscar’s feet. Foster thwarted Oscar again when another Chelsea move ended with the forward taking a touch and attempting an audacious back-heel. There were cried of ‘Ole’ from the Stamford Bridge crowd, midway through the first half, as a triangle of Cesc Fabregas, Azpilicueta and Oscar played the ball out from the left corner of their own half, with a cheeky flick from the Brazilian thrown in.

But whatever Mourinho told his players at the break reined them in and the second half was a far more solemn affair, still dominated by Chelsea. Whatever ideas he had shared the day before, this was vintage Mourinho, straight from his personal tactics book. Kill a team off then suffocate them with possession to ease to victory. ‘We decreased the intensity,’ Mourinho said. ‘It made it easier for them.’ Still their utter domination in Albion’s half allowed for breaks. Five minutes after the restart John Terry was denied by Foster with a powerful header and on 73 minutes Fabregas threaded a pass between five players to set Hazard free inside the box. He shimmied to put the goalkeeper off, before taking a shot. Yet again, Foster was in the way. Oscar was among those performing at the highest standard for Chelsea against West Brom .

"Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney hailed his side's patience as they beat Arsenal 2-1 at the Emirates on Saturday evening. Rooney grabbed United's second goal, after Kieran Gibbs inadvertently put the ball into his own net to open the scoring, and the forward was open in admitting how vital it was to secure Louis van Gaal's first away win in charge of the club. 'I think it's a very important victory,' Rooney told Sky Sports.

"Sergio Aguero has grabbed all the headlines at Manchester City this season but Saturday proved they also need Yaya Toure firing on all cylinders to have any chance of retaining the title. Toure put recent troubles behind him to score his first Premier League goal at The Etihad this season and complete a hard-fought Manchester City comeback against opponents who literally spilled blood for their cause. Swansea had taken a shock lead through Wilfried Bony only for the champions to level quickly with a neat finish from Stevan Jovetic.

Subs not used: Tremmel, Tiendalli, Amat, Britton . Goals: Bony 9 . Referee: Neil Swarbrick 5 . Attendance: 45,448 . Star player: Sergio Aguero . And with a feisty encounter in the balance, Toure powered forward from midfield as he did so many times last season to convert Fernandinho's back-heel. It was no doubt a relief to manager Manuel Pellegrini, who knows his side had become over-reliant on Aguero with the Argentine scoring half of Manchester City's 24 league goals on his own. He will hope Toure's winner, which came at the end of a long week in which he helped Ivory Coast qualify for the African Cup of Nations, will mark a new beginning for the player after a troubling few months in which his brother died of cancer, he fell out with a club over an alleged birthday snub and has suffered racial abuse on social media. 'I think it was an important moment for Yaya. He played two games in the international break, the second one on Wednesday, so maybe he was tired. But he had the personality and character to continue playing until the end,' said Pellegrini. 'You can't always analyse Yaya on whether he has scored a goal. It will be impossible for it to be like last season because he is a midfielder, not a striker. But it is important for him to play and I think he played very well. 'If you remember, all the players were involved in scoring goals last season. So it was important that today Sergio couldn't do it but Stevan and Yaya could.' With Chelsea also winning, it was vital Manchester City secured maximum points to stay only eight points behind Jose Mourinho's men. But it certainly wasn't easy against Swansea who have added steel under manager Garry Monk to their pleasing style. Swansea hadn't beaten their opponents on home soil since 1951 when Sir Winston Churchill was Prime Minister. Swansea striker Wilfried Bony gave them an early first half lead against  City on Saturday afternoon . Bony (centre) met Nathan Dyer's through ball to put them ahead after nine minutes at the Etihad . Bony celebrates his goal with his Swansea team-mates during Saturday's Premier League clash . MINS PLD    KM    MILES . Manchester City                          109.2    67.9 . Jesus Navas                       90         11.5      7.2 .

But they enjoyed the perfect start after nine minutes when nobody challenged Nathan Dyer outside and he had time to chip a pass to Bony, who had run in behind Kompany and Pablo Zabaleta without them noticing. Bony controlled Dyer's pass with his chest and had no problems slipping the ball past a stranded Joe Hart. For once, Aguero wasn't involved in the equaliser after 19 minutes. Toure began the move with a neat pass to Jesus Navas on the left-hand side. And when the Spaniard whipped a cross into the six-yard box it was Jovetic who sniffed out the chance and got their first to turn in from close range. It was the striker's first goal for his club since a brace against Liverpool in August. The two quickfire goals created a feisty atmosphere with Kyle Bartley deservedly going into the book for challenging Aguero from behind. And Kompany took a risk when he led with his arm and boots and knees raised high, and caught Taylor in an aerial duel, leaving the Swansea player dazed and bleeding profusely down the left side of his face. Taylor had to be patched up on the touchline using spray and returned looking like a boxer who'd gone 15 rounds with Mike Tyson, though Swansea manager Garry Monk absolved Kompany of blame and quipped: 'It was a nasty bump but it'll make Neil better-looking, the scar will do him good.' Kompany seemed extra pumped-up and did find his way into the book for blocking off Bony after 31 minutes. And Aguero was then provocatively shoved in the back off-the-ball by Bartley and remonstrated with Angel Rangel about it.

At that point, Mr Swarbrick decided he'd had enough and gave both captains a stern talking-to in order for things to calm things down, and it worked. Football broke out and Gael Clichy had a thumping 25-yard shot tipped onto the post by Lukasz Fabianski.. Then, just past the hour, it was Toure time. Samir Nasri's pass was backheeled into the midfielder's path by Fernandinho and his power took him past two despairing Swansea challenges before he tucked a tidy finish under Fabianski. Still, Swansea could have levelled late on. Substitute Bafetimbi Gomis shot wide when put through by Bony's pass and then Jonjo Shelvey's injury-time free-kick deflected off the top of the wall and went inches wide with Hart beaten. 'We should have taken our chances,' complained Monk, but he can be delighted with how his team have started the season. For Pellegrini, there is no respite.

"Alan Pardew crossed his hands and looked to the heavens as a tearful Ryan Taylor – injured on his first league start in 32 months - made his way down the tunnel holding the same knee which has caused him two years of pain. The Newcastle boss will have to wait and see if his prayers are answered on that front. But at least the divine and devastating intervention of Moussa Sissoko ensured a fifth win on the spin in the Premier League, lifting them, albeit briefly, to fourth in the table. To give their ascent some context, the Magpies were in the relegation zone just five weeks ago.

Fingers crossed he’s okay.’ Pardew added: ‘When you’re a manager you live through some of that pain and we've had many chats trying to keep his spirits up. ‘I don’t want to go down that line with him again. I want him to come in and say “it was a bit of a scare, I’m okay.”’ Sissoko’s brilliant winner came 12 minutes from time, forging his way into the penalty area before swapping passes with Sammy Ameobi and hooking beyond Rob Green, who had repelled all thrown at him to that point. The France international was skippering the side in the absence of Fabricio Coloccini and was the game’s stand-out player. ‘Moussa was the best player on the pitch by some distance,’ said Pardew. ‘We had a long discussion about the captaincy and I wanted to make sure it did not knock him out of kilt. Sometimes it can take your mind off the game. ‘But he grew with the armband. It was a wonderful goal.’ Harry Redknapp, meanwhile, saw his side remain bottom of the table after a sixth straight loss on the road. The Londoners were without pacey frontman Eduardo Vargas, and that, says the manager, cost them dear.

He wanted to be with his wife who was having a baby, and that’s fair enough.’ Pardew’s side, though, had deserved the maximum return. It was Taylor who dictated the tempo from the centre of the park early on. One cleverly-crafted corner saw Remy Cabella locate Taylor lurking unmarked on the fringe of the area. He used one touch to cushion and the next to draw a palmed save from Green. Cabella – enjoying his first home start since September – was again the architect behind Taylor’s next chance – a measured curler from 20 yards – but again Green kept it goalless. Taylor then took aim with a free-kick from range – slamming it into the wall – before succumbing to injury. St James’ – like Pardew – looked to the sky in hope when the 30-year-old plonked himself on the turf and signalled to the bench that he had a problem. But the look on Taylor’s face told its own story and he received a standing ovation as he limped from the field. The second period did not come to life until just before the hour mark when Sissoko set off on a galloping run from deep inside his own half. Covering fully 50 yards unopposed, he slid Ayoze Perez through on goal but again it was Green who proved United’s nemesis. It was always going to take an individual effort to break the deadlock and that moment arrived courtesy of Sissoko. Home thoughts, however, very quickly turned to Taylor.

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho insists the club made the right decision in not keeping Frank Lampard as it would have hindered the development of younger players. The former England midfielder left Stamford Bridge last summer as the club's all-time leading goalscorer, and after initially signing for Major League Soccer franchise New York City he was loaned to sister club Manchester City. Lampard has responded with six goals this season - including Saturday's winner at Leicester - to show he can still do a job in the Premier League, but Mourinho is unrepentant about the decision to allow the 36-year-old to leave. Frank Lampard celebrates scoring the winner for Chelsea against Leicester on Saturday . 'It's his life, nothing to do with us. He left Chelsea as a free agent and chooses his life, we can't complain about it. That's football,' said the Portuguese. 'My view is that when you want to look forward, look to the future and have people like (Cesc) Fabregas and (Nemanja) Matic and Jeremie Boga (a midfielder with the under-21s) which are the next 10 years of the club. Lampard shakes hands with City boss Manuel Pellegrini after being substituted . 'The project is to prepare for the next 10 years, not for the next year - we made the right decision. 'You can argue 'You have John Terry and Didier Drogba'. Different. Drogba is a striker that is coming to help and support the team. Jose Mourinho says he was planning for the future when he let Lampard leave in the summer . 'John Terry is the best central defender in English football and it doesn't matter how old he is. 'The nucleus of the team has to be developed and to have a big player like Frank we would stop the development of the other guys.'","Frank Lampard spent 13 years at Stamford Bridge .

"Ronnie Moore could be set for a return to management with the Football League’s bottom club Hartlepool United, eight months after he was sacked by Tranmere Rovers for a breach of betting rules. The 61-year-old was fired in April after he admitted an FA charge relating to betting on competitions and matches in which his club was involved. Moore broke the rules after placing bets via a family member’s account, including a £1 stake on Tranmere to win in a double with Manchester United, which returned £3.93. Ronnie Moore could be set for a return to management with League Two's bottom club Hartlepool United . Following his dismissal, Moore said: ‘The only thing I’m guilty of really is I’m embarrassed because as a manager of Tranmere Rovers I should have known (the rules) – so I hold my hands up, it was my fault.’ Speaking at the time, his solicitor, Steve Smith, added: ‘The prosecution accepted there were no integrity issues against him.’ Moore was fined £2,000 and given a one-month suspension, suspended for two years. And now Sportsmail understands he is in the running to replace Paul Murray at Victoria Park. Hartlepool recently sacked manager Paul Murray - his reign at the club lasted just seven matches . The final straw for Hartlepool's hierarchy came when the side lost to non-League Blyth Spartans in the FA Cup . Moore – who came close to landing the Carlisle job before Keith Curle was appointed in September - faces competition from former Scunthorpe boss Brian Laws and ex-Middlesbrough assistant Mark Venus, although Pools are keen to install an experienced manager and the Scouser fits the bill. They are six points from safety at the bottom of League Two and have not won in the league for two months. Murray’s reign lasted just seven matches, during which time Pools won once – 2-0 against East Thurrock in the FA Cup First Round – but were beaten 2-1 by non-league Blyth Spartans in the Second Round last weekend. That result led to Murray and assistant Willie Donachie being sacked. Sportsmail understands Murray had even offered to help contribute towards the cost of bringing in new players in a bid to spark a turnaround. Moore broke the rules after placing 95 bets via a family member’s account, including a £1 stake on Tranmere .","Moore broke betting rules after placing bets via a family member's account .

"Ronny Deila is praying for a glamour tie in the last 32 of the Europa League that will bring the thunder back to Parkhead. A thumping 4-1 win over managerless St Mirren increased the gap at the top of the Premiership to six points and teed up Monday’s draw in Nyon. Inter Milan, Everton, Atletico Bilbao and old foes Legia Warsaw are just four of the teams the Scottish champions could face. Celtic boss Ronny Deila is praying for a glamour tie in the last 32 of the Europa League . With large gaps in the Parkhead stands now a feature at home games, Deila wants the kind of name which could bring the missing fans back and pack the stadium to the rafters. ‘It’s going to be a hard draw whoever we get,’ said the Norwegian. ‘We’re going to meet a good club. ‘We want a good draw so we can fill the stadium and get 60,000 here - which is the atmosphere we want. Everybody is beatable but some are harder than others.’ Celtic’s reinstatement to the Champions League sparked a row with Legia Warsaw in the summer and, following a 6-1 aggregate defeat, Deila admitted he would rather avoid the Poles. Celtic could face Polish side Legia Warsaw, who have beaten them already this season . ‘Would I like Legia Warsaw? They’re a good team of course and it would be a special team if we got them. Hopefully we will get something else - but our players will be up for the game whoever we get.’ Two goals from Scott Brown and one apiece from James Forrest – his first of the season – and Anthony Stokes eased Celtic past St Mirren. Brown missed the Legia double header with an early season injury, but has no preferences ahead of the draw. Scott Brown (left) celebrates his opening strike against St Mirren as Celtic moved six points clear . ‘I don’t think it really matters – we will happily take on anybody,’ he said. ‘If it’s at Celtic Park, whoever we get it’s a great atmosphere and a great occasion for us.’ St Mirren equalised through full-back Sean Kelly and made early chances, but had keeper Mark Ridgers to thank for keeping the score down after the home side blew a raft of chances. ‘It was a slow start from us,’ said Deila, ‘but we improved towards the end of the first half. We kept possession, created chances and scored three good goals. ‘We moved the ball very quickly which was good. We then created a lot of chances in the second half and got to 4-1. After that we controlled the game. ‘Overall it’s a good win, an important win. That’s us six points ahead so I’m very satisfied. Sean Kelly equalised for St MIrren but James Forrest (above) restored Celtic's lead in the 15th minute . ‘We are creating chances and that’s the positive thing. But again, I was thinking: “Is it enough? Should we be scoring more goals?” ‘That is something we have to work on if we are going to improve. We need to be more clinical.’ Deila played down fresh fears over Forrest, removed at half-time, by explaining the winger had a migraine. However, John Guidetti took a kick which forced his removal after 55 minutes and the Swede faces tests on Monday morning. ‘Hopefully he’s going to be okay,’ said Deila. ‘The medical people checked him and said they think it’s just a kick, but you never know with these things.’ Celtic – watched by former idol Shunsuke Nakamura - are now easing towards a fourth successive title and Brown believes they will take some stopping. Anthony Stokes (centre) caps off a dominant display for the home side with his 67th minute strike . ‘It has taken time, but we are starting to find our form. On this form it will be hard for teams to catch us. ‘If we keep going and creating the chances and scoring the goals we are going to be hard to beat. ‘Europe is always different and it’s hard for us there. Everyone knows the teams we can get, it’s going to be difficult no matter where we go. ‘The SPFL is the one for us and we need to concentrate more than anything on that – to retain that title again.’","Ronny Deila is praying for a glamour tie in the last 32 of the Europa League .

"This is the moment a leaping spider that has menaced a family for five years was dramatically lured from its hole to catch a fake fly. The Gibson family recorded the moment they confronted the green-fanged creature, which they say has been living in a hole behind their garage wall in Plymouth, Devon, since 2009. Father-of-three James, 27, is convinced the same spider - which he says is a Segestria florentina, more commonly known as a tube web spider - has been lurking above the door frame ever since. Scroll down for video . This is the moment a jumping spider that has menaced a family for five years leapt from its hole, after being lured out by a fake fly . After a fake fly at the end of a stick is used to poke the hole, the spider could be seen charging out of its nest in a bid to snare the pretend insect . But after his 24-year-old wife Katy grew tired of living with the spider, the Gibsons decided it was time to  lure the eight-legged creature out of its lair. The family initially tried to provoke the spider with a stick. But when the plan failed, their four-year-old son Charlie up with a better idea. He suggested to his parents that they could use one of his toys - which has a fake fly attached to a stick - to poke the spider's hole. In the footage, the spider is seen charging out of its nest in a bid to snare the pretend insect, as Mr Gibson's father prods the hole. But, within a split-second, the speedy spider has scurried back up the wall and retreated back into its nest. Mr Gibson, a precision engineer, said: 'We first noticed the spider about five years ago. I'm sure its the same one. The spider - dubbed 'Mr Long Legs' by the Gibson children -  scurried back up the wall and retreated back into its nest . 'There are tonnes of spiders living in the garage but most of them are just average - this one has a really menacing look to it. 'He lives in a little hole which is on the doorframe walking into the garage but comes out to peer down at his web. 'My dad used the fly puppet to gently touch the web and the spider hurtled out. He moved really fast - before you knew it he was right back in his hole.' Mr Gibson and his three children - Charlie, four, Harry, three and Olivia, two - call the spider 'Mr Long Legs' because of its size. The Gibson family, pictured, say they are sure it is the same spider because it has a really 'menacing look' Mr Gibson, a precision engineer, first spotted the spider living in a hole behind their garage wall in Plymouth, Devon, in 2009 . Mr Gibson said it lives in a little hole (left) which is on the door frame (right) walking into the garage - but comes out to peer down at his web . They had previously tried to lure the creature using a normal stick, but did not have any luck. Tube-web spiders are one of the largest spiders in Europe and are nocturnal hunters that prey on cockroaches, moths, bees and wasps. They sow distinctive tube-shaped webs in cracks and holes and wait by the entrance for prey to touch the strands. They first entered the UK 150 years ago from continental Europe, arriving on ships docking in ports. The females tend to be larger than males and can reach a body length of up to 22mm. If left undisturbed, domestic house spiders can live as long as seven years in the same web in places like attics, basements, and garages. One of the tube web spiders that have invaded the outside walls and garden of Mr Jackson's home . Segestria florentina is the largest European spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm. Originally from the Mediterranean, they can be found as far east as Georgia but are also commonly spotted in Britain - particularly in the later half of the year. They have a black or dark brown body, often with a green shine on their fangs. While their bite has no long lasting effects, it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours. They are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it. Sightings of the spider in Britain have in the past been confused with the deadly Australian funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique. Kelvin Boot, a naturalist and former BBC radio presenter, said the tube web spider might look scary but says it’s not dangerous to humans. He said: ‘It bites in defence so if you pick one up, or it gets caught in your clothing, you are likely to be nipped. But no British spider delivers a fatal bite or even one dangerous to humans. ‘It seems this spider was accidentally introduced into UK from its native Mediterranean and North Africa. ‘It sits at the mouth of its tunnel in old brickwork or behind loose bark or any other suitable hole, waiting for a hapless insect to stumble across the spokes - tripwires that alert the spider to its victim. ‘Once detected, the spider moves like lightning. I defy anybody not to jump when this happens as it is such a surprise even if you are expecting it. ‘The prey is dragged back into the narrow tube and eventually the spider’s venom overcomes the prey.’ Stuart Hine, from the Angela Marmont Centre Manager at the Natural History Museum, said: ‘They can fall, or plunge if they are on a wall, but you wouldn’t really describe it as jumping. 'Equally if you came across a male out of his silk tube and provoked him by poking him he could probably just about raise a hop, but they are certainly not considered jumping spiders.’","James Gibson, 27, spotted spider in his garage in Plymouth, Devon in 2009 .

"Wasps will aim for a winning send-off from Adams Park on Sunday that would also keep them in European Champions Cup quarter-final contention. Wasps' 12-year stint in High Wycombe ends after their Pool Two appointment with Castres. When they resume Aviva Premiership business against London Irish in eight days' time, it will be at their new Ricoh Arena base in Coventry.

But Wasps rugby director Dai Young knows there can be no distractions from the task of aiming to stay in touch with group pace-setters Harlequins and Leinster. 'The players are fully focused on the 80 minutes of rugby ahead of them on Sunday, but we appreciate it will be a significant occasion for our supporters, as well as a significant game of rugby,' Young said. 'It would be nice to sign off at Adams Park with a great performance and a great win. It would be a fitting way to thank our fans for the support they've shown there over the years. 'This a huge match for us in Europe. Director of rugby Dai Young says his Wasps are ready for a significant occasion and match . 'We were really pleased with the bonus point win in the south of France last Sunday (Wasps beat Castres 32-17), but we know the job is only half done. 'An away win last week means nothing if we don't back it up on Sunday. 'Castres have some really good individual players, and if it clicks for them they could be really dangerous. 'Coming into these two European matches, I always said we would need to win both to have a realistic chance of progressing.' While Wasps can afford no slip-ups, the same can be said for twice European champions Munster as they prepare to tackle Clermont Auvergne at Stade Marcel Michelin on Sunday. Clermont's 16-9 success in Limerick last weekend gave them possession of Pool One's box seat, and Munster now have it all to do in a group that also includes last season's beaten European finalists Saracens. Clermont celebrate overcoming Munster 16-9 last week in a rare loss for the home side in Limerick . 'It is only half-time - that is the beauty of having these back-to-back games - and we can put it right,' Munster skipper Peter O'Mahony said. 'We came up against an excellent side last weekend. We knew it was going to be tough, and we knew from the day the pool was drawn that it would be tough. 'I thought Clermont played well, but I thought we could have a done a lot of things better.

"Andy Murray has gained a fiancee but lost two of his key lieutenants with his life set to change on different fronts. Before it emerged that he was engaged to long-time girlfriend Kim Sears, he announced a distinctly inharmonious separation from two other constants in his life over recent years — assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and fitness trainer Jez Green. Decidedly less romantic it may be, but the latter development will have more immediate impact on a career that the Scot hopes still has five seasons to run. Andy Murray (centre), pictured with mother Judy (left) and Andy Ireland (second right) in 2012, has split with longstanding assistant coach Dani Vallverdu (second left) and physical trainer Jez Green (right) The Scot suffered a dreadful finish match of the season as he was smashed by Roger Federer . Murray's decision to bring in Amelie Mauresmo as his coach is said to have brought about tensions . The departure of Vallverdu and Green distances him further from the glory of the Ivan Lendl era and cements his relationship with Amelie Mauresmo. Lendl, who guided Murray to the US Open, Wimbledon and Olympic titles, last night told Sportsmail: ‘As you know, I think very highly of Dani and Jez and their work.’ With their exit, officially described as ‘mutual’ but inevitably more complicated than that, the 27-year-old Scot has reaffirmed his faith in Mauresmo. A brief statement brought to an end Vallverdu’s five and Green’s seven years of solid service. ‘We sat down at the end of the season and decided a change would be best for all of us,’ said Murray, who flew yesterday to Manila to begin his lucrative stint in the inaugural International Tennis Premier League. ‘My off-season training and Australian Open preparations have already begun and I am very excited for the new year. I thank Jez and Dani for all their hard work over the years and wish them the best for the future.’ Vallverdu (right) chats to Murray during a training session at Roland Garros in Paris in June 2012 . Murray plays a shot during his match with Kei Nishikori of Japan during the ATP World Tour Finals . Green (front row, second right) and Vallverdu (second left, front row) watch Murray in 2012 . That may be true as far as it goes, but the reasons behind the split lie in the growing influence of Mauresmo and the differences of opinion in the camp that have developed since her arrival. It is known that Murray’s long-time friend Vallverdu has not enjoyed working with the 35-year-old Frenchwoman. Both Vallverdu and Green only discovered that Mauresmo’s appointment was on the cards when they read Sportsmail’s exclusive revelation during the French Open that the groundbreaking move was imminent. Their upset at being kept out of the loop became more clear after Murray lost in this summer’s Wimbledon quarter-final, although things appeared to have settled down thereafter. In recent weeks when he went on a tear through Asia and Europe to qualify for the Barclays ATP World Finals, Murray went out of his way to give credit to Vallverdu (the Venezuelan was there through Asia, while Mauresmo was absent). But after Murray’s 6-0, 6-1 defeat by Roger Federer in the Tour Finals, Vallverdu is said to have made it clear he was unhappy. He had been in charge since Lendl walked out in March and was effectively demoted when Mauresmo came on board. Ivan Lendl (centre), Green and Vallverdu were all key to Murray's success in the majors and Olympics . Murray has always been ruthless when making coaching changes. In his senior career he has gone through Mark Petchey, American Brad Gilbert, Miles Maclagan and former Spanish star Alex Corretja. Murray and Green are said to have disagreed about training. Green wanted to stick with the uncompromising routines of old that turned Murray into a super-athlete, while the player is said to favour a more nuanced approach as he heads into his late twenties. I understand that the trainer recently undertook some work with the hugely promising 17-year-old German Alexander Zverev, and that has also been a source of friction between the pair. While Murray is now set to work more full time with his London-based trainer, Matt Little, he is likely to bring in a replacement for Vallverdu to work under Mauresmo. Roger Federer (left) talks to Andy Murray during a match at the Australian Open in January 2013 . Many former top players are privately sceptical about whether she can take him on (but anxious about saying it publicly for fear of being accused of sexism). In the final analysis, to finish ranked sixth in a season returning from back surgery is a fine effort, but since he and Mauresmo teamed up the only sign of his Wimbledon-winning form has come in the first two sets of the US Open quarter-final against Novak Djokovic. Otherwise Murray has had to rely on his fighting instincts to beat lesser players and scoop his three ATP titles since late September. He insists that only next season can the partnership be judged, and Mauresmo will have to instil in him a more dynamic and aggressive style if he is to seriously challenge the top three once again.","Andy Murray has made some changes to his backroom staff .

"Manchester City open their new £200million training centre on Monday, and it belongs among the finest football centres of excellence in the world. But City have not always enjoyed such luxury. IAN LADYMAN remembers the club's more humble roots, from their iconic old Platt Lane training ground to training side-by-side with rivals Manchester United at Carrington, complete with scary security guard. Welcome to Man City's new £200m Football Factory... with circular dressing rooms, cookery classes and altitude training . For many years now, a tiny corner of rural Greater Manchester has been purely football. Past the Trafford Centre, throw a right at the roundabout, through the lights and you get to Carrington, home – among other things – to the training grounds of Manchester's two football clubs. Take a five-iron and strike it well from United's northerly pitches and the chances are those picking the ball up will be wearing City blue. So close they could hardly escape each other even if they wanted to. An aerial view of Manchester City's new £200m Etihad Campus - which is being hailed as the best training facility in the world . The complex is attached to the club's Etihad Stadium via a footbridge over Alan Turing Way . City have come a long way from their old home at Maine Road  - here they play against Portsmouth in 1936 . Scott Sinclair, Fernando, Jesus Navas, Frank Lampard and Dedryck Boyata (left to right) are put through their paces at the new complex . City's legendary goalkeeper Bert Trautmann, who played for the club between 1949 and 1964, sits on a terrace at Maine Road . When United manager Sir Alex Ferguson talked of his club's 'noisy neighbours' this is what he meant. Today, however, it changes. Today City's players are turning their sports cars and their SUVs east towards the previously neglected Manchester suburbs of Gorton and Beswick. Here, opposite their own Etihad Stadium, lies their new training ground. Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown was given an exclusive tour of the world-class new training facility by Patrick Vieira, Manchester City's head of Elite Development. CLICK HERE to watch a fun, quick-fire Q&A with the two former Arsenal Invincibles, including how the old friends describe each other in just three words... And you can read the full, brilliant interview as Keown met Vieira from 10pm on Monday night by visiting www.dailymail.co.uk/sport . Hailed – admittedly by City themselves – as one of the best sporting facilities in the world, the Etihad Campus has cost in the region of £150million to build, has 16 pitches, its own 7,000-seater reserve stadium, an accommodation block and even a sixth-form College to serve its local community. And more. Carrington, it must be said, was somewhat different. City's home for more than a decade - they previously trained at the rather iconic Platt Lane centre in Manchester's inner-city – it didn't even have a security barrier for many years. Instead it had a rather fierce looking Scot named 'Michael' who spent his days peering at you from inside a one-man sentry booth decorated with City calendars, posters and gifts from the players. If he knew you, Michael would tell you his latest joke. If he didn't, he would probably scare the life out of you. This was City pre-Abu Dhabi, though. Things were different, then. The first manager I encountered there was Kevin Keegan. 'Nice to meet you, I hate your paper,' were his first words to me in the winter of 2001. Back then the media used to walk round the back of the main building, up some rather fragile-looking stairs that always needed painting and in to a room that doubled up as an analysis 'suite' – it had a round table and some chairs – when we weren't there. On a shelf on the side was a never ending supply of footballs and black marker pens. Once a week the players would file past and sign. Keegan was often late, usually because he had been playing head tennis with his coaches out the back. 'Don't say I admitted that,' he once said. 'It will invalidate my medical insurance on my back.' In the late Sixties, the days of City stars like Mike Summerbee, left, players were put through their paces on an athletics track at Longford Park. Here, the former England international is given tips by ex-Great Britain one-mile runner Stan Taylor . After the Christmas break in 1969, City players were sent on a 30-minute run at Wythenshawe Park to shed off any excess pounds . City's former first-team training ground Platt Lane is now used by the club's academy for matches . The club's younger ranks are put through their paces ahead of their friendly against Barnsley in September 2013 . City Under 18s take on Manchester United U18s at the old Platt Lane training ground . In those days, players such as Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman ruled the roost at Carrington, waiting round the corner to fire footballs at team-mates emerging in to the complex's wide open spaces from a changing block that looked rather like something out of the film Kes. It was all very high school. Joey Barton, meanwhile, used to use that area as his own private driving range, golf balls pinging high in to the distance from his driver. A very good golfer, maybe Joey was aiming at Sir Alex across the other side of the hedge. Keegan once made his exit from Carrington under a blanket on the back seat of a car. His crime? To make a joke about Liverpudlians and hub caps as he signed Fowler. The Sun newspaper sent reporters dressed in black curly wigs to ambush him. 'Michael' on security would have eaten them for his breakfast. As time passed, things changed. The essence of Carrington never did, though. Even to this day – when City had to erect a big, cold tent to host Champions League press conferences – the throwback feel of the place remains. Stuart Pearce liked to hold press conferences at 8am. I think it was a macho thing. The problem was that, as results faded, the media just stopped turning up. Maybe that was the plan all along. City entered a new era when Sven-Goran Eriksson introduced a table to sit behind when he spoke to journalists at press conferences . Sven made sure he knew everybody's name at Carrington during his time at City, and when he was sacked there were tears from some . Sven-Goran Eriksson, meanwhile, finally introduced a table to sit behind for press conferences. For City, that was progress. They loved Sven at Carrington, especially the women. He knew everybody's name. When it emerged that he paid for the £2,000-a-night top-floor suite at Manchester's Radisson Edwardian out of his own pocket every night, the Swede's legend only grew. City weren't bad on the field under Eriksson, either. When he was sacked – unjustly – they cried at Carrington. On his arrival, Mark Hughes did his best to tart things up a bit. He thought Carrington was 'unfit for purpose' and he was probably right. Given that he had come from Blackburn, though, it said everything. Mark Hughes was unhappy with City's Carrington training ground facilities upon his arrival from Blackburn . Hughes disliked the media getting too close so they built us a pre-fabricated hut just inside the entrance while money was spent on the dressing rooms, too. Pretty soon, Michael on security was no more. Someone didn't like his tattoos apparently. With the Arab money that soon arrived, Carrington got new signage and some trees lining the driveway that were rumoured to cost £1,000 each. The training ground soon got Roberto Mancini and Mario Balotelli, too. Mancini often used to cycle to work – with his faithful aide 'Jose' driving behind him in case of 'emergencies' – while the photographers that lined the public footpath nearby feasted on the punch-ups that, for a while, became part of the City story. I once suggested to one of Mancini's coaches that the club just erect a big fence to protect the sessions from the lenses. 'The council won't let us,' he replied. 'Anyway, it would be cheaper if the players just stopped fighting.'

Former Manchester City boss  Mancini (left) came to blows with Balotelli (right) during a training session in January 2013 . For a while the bad publicity was a problem for City but, on the whole, they were impressively sanguine. Across the fence, Ferguson was paranoid about the secrecy of his training sessions, as indeed is Louis van Gaal now. City, though, took a different view. On learning that one geeky fan was climbing a tree to view sessions through binoculaurs, they didn't set the dogs on him. Instead they invited him inside for a guided tour and a meet-and-greet session. The CFA site pictured during its early stages of redevelopment from a brownfield site into the training complex .

City youth players play head tennis before construction begins, with the Etihad Stadium in the background . At the 'Etihad Complex' I suspect things may be a little different. That's what they call progress. If you want to spy on training this week, you may wish to hire a drone. Manuel Pellegrini and his players will want for nothing, that's for sure. The Premier League is a different place now. They will still moan, though. Players always do. For a start – from their homes in the Cheshire enclaves of Wilmslow, Alderley Edge and Prestbury – the new place is a lot more difficult to get to.","Manchester City unveil new state-of-the-art £200m training centre on Monday .

"They say that nice guys finish last, but for Borussia Dortmund it seems that winning is less important than playing the game in the right spirit. Jurgen Klopp's team may be struggling in the Bundesliga, but they refused to take advantage of an indisposed opponent during Saturday's game against Hertha Berlin. During the first half Hertha midfielder Per Ciljan Skjelbred went down after a challenge while Dortmund were in possession, leading the players to halt the game temporarily.

It soon became clear that Skjelbred was not injured, but had merely lost his boot, yet the visitors refused to carry on until he was ready to play again. The Dortmund back four, at the instruction of German defender Mats Hummels, simply passed the ball amongst themselves until the Norweigian had sorted himself out and given the thumbs up. The 2013 Champions League finalists' fair play was applauded by their manager, but didn't do them much good on the pitch - Dortmund suffered their ninth defeat of the season to fall back into the relegation zone. Still, while results may be going against them, Dortmund seem determined to improve their standing by playing football in the right way.

"Mary Adams was left with a fractured spine after being thrown against the wall by the automatic door . An 80-year-old woman was left with a fractured spine after being thrown 7ft backwards by an automatic door at Marks & Spencer, she claims. Mary Adams had been food shopping at the store in Birmingham when she became caught in the doors at the rear exit. The pensioner says she was catapulted 7ft when they reopened, throwing her to the ground and causing her to lose consciousness. The divorcee later discovered her ribs, back and head had been bruised. An MRI scan revealed she had fractured her spine, though doctors were not able to tell how old the break was. 'I was just popping in to the store to get some ready meals for the week ahead,' she said. 'I had a mooch around and was going through the automatic rear door which was open and it literally just shut on me. 'It was a folding door that trapped me and then I was thrown into a wall seven feet away as they reopened. 'I remember being thrown through the air, sliding down the wall and hitting my head and then waking up on the steps in a lot of pain. 'I was unconscious for a few minutes. My head, neck and rib cage were all bruised. 'I went back to measure afterwards and it threw me at least seven feet to the steps outside. 'I was literally catapulted through the air before I smashed off this wall and cracked my head on the steps. 'It was terrifying.' Staff at the store rushed to the woman's aid, propping her head up on a pillow before taking her for a coffee. An incident report said she was 'unhurt' except from having a sore head from where she crashed against the floor. The company compensated her with a bunch of flowers and a £20 discount voucher. But Ms Adams, who lives alone,  feels she is entitled to more. 'I thought M&S were a great company. 'I thought they would look after me and at least call to see how I was. 'But after a first call when I told them I was feeling very groggy, no-one called back. The 80-year-old was leaving the store when she became trapped in the doors at the back exit after finishing her shopping . Ms Adams was sent flowers and given a discount voucher for the store in Birmingham City Centre (pictured) 'Then they sent me a letter saying they were sorry I had fallen. It’s ridiculous to say that I had a fall when it was their doors that trapped me and flung me across the floor.' The pensioner is now appealing for a woman who rushed to help her and tried to call an ambulance to come forward, so she can continue legal action against the major company. A spokesman for M&S said: 'We are sorry Mrs Adams was disappointed by her experience in our store. 'The safety of our customers is our top priority and an engineer immediately inspected the doors and no fault was found.'","Mary Adams thrown '7ft backwards' by electronic door in Birmingham .

"At May’s Football Writers’ Association dinner held in honour of 2014 winner Luis Suarez, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers told an audience that he had been privileged to work with the Uruguayan and spoke of the lengths the player had reached to improve his behaviour. What we know now, as many of us suspected back then, was that Suarez had merely been fooling us all along. Inside this gifted footballer’s head is a brain that simply cannot be rewired. Towards the end of this awful game in the stifling heat of Natal on Tuesday afternoon, I had found my mind wandering to the next steps in this competition. Thoughts of Thursday’s Germany-USA game and Saturday’s knockout tie between Brazil and Chile had begun to occupy me.

A statement on FIFA's website said: 'FIFA can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the player Luis Suarez of Uruguay following an apparent breach of art. 48 and/or art. 57 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code during the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil match Italy-Uruguay played on 24 June 2014.

Click here for the full story . There was just not enough to hold the attention at the Arena das Dunas two-thirds of the way through what had pretty quickly established itself as the worst game of this brilliant World Cup. Suarez, though, changed all that and, just as it had been at Anfield on April 22 2013, he did so with absolutely no prior warning. This is the thing about the 27-year-old that is so disconcerting. He doesn’t do vicious, stupid things at the culmination of a festering dispute with opponents. 'He doesn’t do them as acts of retaliation. He just does them instinctively. For reasons that he probably doesn’t even recognise himself, he just does them. I was at Anfield 14 months ago when Suarez sank his teeth in to the arm of Branislav Ivanovic of Chelsea. My experience then ran parallel to my experience on Monday. First of all, I missed it with my naked eye as I followed the ball elsewhere. Then I saw the replays and suspected a head butt. Then the astounding reality of the actual events became apparent. Watch . enough football and you will see just about everything eventually. There . are only so many possible stories, after all. It’s just the names that . change. You become accustomed to the cheating, the sly violence, the . diving, the moaning and the carping. Controversy: Luis Suarez is captured biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in April 2012 . Bite night! Ivanovic explains what happened to the referee before Luis Suarez received a 10-game ban . 'These situations happen on the field. 'I had contact with his shoulder, nothing more, things like that happen all the time. 'I don't know anything, if FIFA analyse each case separately it's going to be complicated. 'I'm very happy to qualify against a European team, after the first match against Costa Rica it was difficult to reverse the situation but we played an incredible match today.' You think nothing shocks you but then something like this comes along and all that changes. This just doesn’t happen in football. Does it? Suarez, of course, now has a culinary crime sheet with three items on it. To the names of PSV’s Otman Bakkal (November 2010) and Ivanovic we can now add Italy’s hulking great defender Giorgio Chiellini. This time, Suarez has sinned on the greatest stage of them all. Prior to . this game on the north-east coast of Brazil, Suarez had chosen to take . on the British media again. The sense of persecution he was encouraged . to feel during his failed attempt to prove he did not racially abuse . Manchester United’s Patrice Evra back in 2011 had clearly not gone away. Previous: Luis Suarez received a seven game ban for biting PSV's Otman Bakkal while playing for Ajax in 2010 . Ouch! Otman Bakkal shows the bite marks to a PSV teammate after the incident in April 2010 . It . was this warped sense of reality that Suarez took with him in to this . game. No matter what Rodgers has said to him – no matter the sessions he . has had with Liverpool’s psychologist Steve Peters – Suarez has still . not fundamentally accepted his role in the two major controversies that . have coloured his time in the Barclays Premier League. Suarez is an angry, self-pitying delusionist lashing out, in word and deed. On Monday he reacted to his assault on Chiellini by throwing himself to the ground. It was an act of inescapable guilt. Holding his mouth immediately afterwards won’t help his cause when FIFA investigate today either. After the final whistle, meanwhile, he hid his face with his shirt. It could have been emotion. It could have been relief at his side’s qualification. It may just have been shame but I doubt it. Cover up?

Luis Suarez may be a genius... but, after latest biting controversy, at what point will football turn its back on him? Paul Scholes: People will remember Uruguay striker Luis Suarez more for his World Cup biting antics against Italy than for his supreme footballing ability . Already, of course, the cover-up has begun. Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez began it immediately after the game. 'This is all a conspiracy,' he said, rather preposterously. 'People hide behind trees looking for a story. 'Those people know who they are.' This, of course, is one of Suarez’s major problems in life. There are simply too many people looking to make excuses for him. Conspiracy theories: Uruguay manager Oscar Tabarez believes people 'hide behind trees looking for a story' I do not include Rodgers in this. The Liverpool manager has done all he can to educate and improve Suarez. Rodgers is rarely critical of his players in public but at the club’s Melwood training base he has not spared last season’s player of the year. To call it tough love is to understate it. Some people don’t learn though and maybe Rodgers knows this now. If he doesn’t then he surely will when Suarez inevitably cites his ‘troubles’ as reason enough to ask out of Liverpool  once more after this World Cup. Suarez’s gifts as a footballer are beyond question. Already he has left us with two of the truly great and memorable goals of this tournament. The fact they both came against England doesn’t really matter. However deep his river of talent ever runs, though, it will never fully submerge or drown his dark side. Guidance: Liverpool boss Rodgers has done all he can to help and educate the Reds' star player . Italian machismo may prevent them complaining formally to FIFA today. Indeed that was the indication on Monday night. FIFA should proceed hastily, though. They have to for the good of their sport. As sad as it sounds, we must now place this episode in the same folder as Zinedine Zidane’s headbutt on Marco Materazzi in 2006 and Frank Rijkaard’s spit at Rudi Voller in 1990.

"Communications Minister Malcolm Turnball has said that police and spy agencies have better things to do than use new metadata laws to chase people illegally downloading Game of Thrones. Australian Federal Police Commissioner Andrew Colvin on Thursday suggested metadata was crucial to being able to investigate not only terrorism but 'illegal downloads, piracy and cybercrimes'. His comment has sparked debate over the scope of the new laws. Communications Minister Malcolm Turnball has made some controversial comments regarding illegally downloading TV and films . He said that police and spy agencies have better things to do than use new metadata laws to chase people illegally downloading Game of Thrones . But Mr Turnbull said police and spy agency ASIO have higher priorities. 'The Australian Federal Police and ASIO frankly are not interested in whether you are illegally downloading a copy of the Game of Thrones,' he told ABC television on Friday. 'That's a bad thing to do, but I can tell you our national security agencies have got other things on their mind.' Mr Turnbull said police and spy agency ASIO have higher priorities than hunting out people who illegally download TV shows such as The Walking Dead . The government's third tranche of anti-terrorism legislation would require companies to hold on to metadata - background information about calls and internet usage but not the content itself - for at least two years. Telcos already collect metadata for the purposes of billing, however many delete the information due to the cost of retaining it. Mr Turnbull said the policy was purely about 'standardising an existing practice' and the government wasn't going after people breaching copyright. Telcos already collect metadata for the purposes of billing, however many delete the information due to the cost of retaining it and thus illegal downloaders of such shows as Homeland are never caught . Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said he had only seen the draft bill for the first time on Thursday and it needed further scrutiny. 'We need to hear evidence from the security agencies but we also should hear evidence from telcos, from civil liberties groups and ordinary Australians,' Mr Shorten said. 'There is a balancing act here between the ability of the police and the security agencies doing their job, but at the same time we have to make sure there is not unintended consequence which go to the liberty of Australians.' Orange Is The New Black fanatics who are illegally downloading episodes of the show are not a priority  to the government . He said the government also needed to clarify who would pay for implementing the scheme. Mr Turnball's comments come after the makers of the film Dallas Buyers Club  revealed that they are hunting Australians who downloaded or share the movie illegally. The makers  filed a discovery order in the Federal Court in a bid to get names and contact details from five Australian telecommunication companies, including iiNet, Internode, Dodo, Amnet and Adam Internet. Mr Turnball's comments come after the makers of the film Dallas Buyers Club revealed that they are hunting Australians who downloaded or share the movie illegally . iiNet has opposed the application by Dallas Buyers Club LLC, citing 'serious concerns' that the film's makers will look to intimidate subscribers. That strategy involves sending intimidating letters to alleged offenders threatening legal action and seeking large sums of money. It is a tactic copyright holders have used in other countries to clamp down on file-sharing via websites such as BitTorrent.

"Kieran Loveridge will spend at least three additional years behind bars for fatally punching Sydney teenager Thomas Kelly. Kelly, 18, suffered catastrophic head injuries after Loveridge punched him once in an unprovoked attack at Sydney's red-light district, Kings Cross, on July 7 2012. His life support was turned off two days later. Loveridge was jailed in November 2013 for just four years for manslaughter, which prompted wide-spread public anger. But Kelly's father, speaking outside the NSW Supreme Court of Appeal on Friday, said his family will not be celebrating the new lengthier jail time which comes after a prosecution appeal. 'You can’t balance a life with years in jail,' he said. Scroll down for video . Kieran Loveridge being led from the Supreme Court in November 2013 after originally being sentenced to four-years for killing Thomas Kelly . Chief Justice Tom Bathurst declared Loveridge would serve a non-parole period of seven years for Mr Kelly's death. Kelly's younger brother Stuart, 16, made a heartfelt plea outside court on Friday for his brother's short life to have some meaning. Speaking for the first time to the media he said: 'Up until now I haven't said anything because I was too young. I tried to block it out. I tried to understand over and over why, at such a young age, my brother lost his life so tragically. But I have no answers.' Thomas Kelly, an 18-year-old accounting cadet, died as a result of an unprovoked assault in Kings Cross . He added: 'I want Thomas' short life to have some meaning in his death. So we can see change... I believe we should have respect for one another, for friends, family, acquaintances, different cultures and complete strangers. A culture where we accept responsibility for our actions.' In November 2013, a court heard how 19-year-old Loveridge had drunk several cans of Smirnoff double black vodka drinks and shots as he prowled Kings Cross and told a friend 'I swear I’m going to bash someone'. Kelly, an accounting cadet, was walking with his girlfriend and talking on his mobile phone when he was violently attacked.

Police originally charged Loveridge with murder but he offered to plead guilty to manslaughter. It was expected that he would receive a lengthy jail term but his sentence of four-years sparked outrage. 'I can't tell you what it's like to lose a child, 18 years old, who had his whole life in front of him and is considered meaningless by the state because this verdict is so shocking,' Mr Kelly's father, Ralph Kelly, said after the decision. Kieran Loveridge's mother (centre) left court in tears after her son's sentence hearing appeal was heard in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Sydney, Friday, July 3, 2014 . After community outrage over Loveridge's four-year sentence, the DPP launched an appeal against the leniency of the decision, which was upheld on Friday. Speaking outside court alongside his wife and son, Ralph Kelly said he and his family were relieved. 'It's difficult - there is no celebration today,' he said. 'You can’t balance a life with years in jail. It’s very bitter sweet as we’re three days away from the anniversary of Thomas’ death.' Loveridge's mother could be heard sobbing as she hurried from the court room.

"A bright-eyed young girl sits on the set of a TV studio, conducting one of her first ever interviews after being selected from a crop of nationwide hopefuls to win a prestigious modelling contract. Undeniably beautiful and destined for greatness, the 13-year-old's selection as a magazine cover girl has already drawn criticism from media groups as being little more than paedophilia. Facing some difficult questions for someone her age - she has just turned 14 after her competition win - she is asked by reporter Tracy Grimshaw if there is anything she would not consider doing in her future career as a model. Scroll down for video . No way: With a crinkled up nose and a curled lip, a 13-year-old Miranda Kerr looks virtually disgusted by the thought of having her picture taken in lingerie . 'You like the idea of travelling?' The question, posed by TV reporter Tracy Grimshaw, left, is met with an enthusiastic 'Yep' by the gangly teenaged Miranda . Starting out: When asked why she wants to be a model - if the answer isn't literally written on her face - Miranda replies, 'I just think it'd be really fun. I love being with people and I love fashion' The young girl's feelings are quite clear on the subject, saying: 'I won't be doing any lingerie shots or anything like that.' The year was 1997 and the teenage girl is Miranda Kerr, who would go on to be one of the world's most recognised lingerie models. The clip was featured in Australian channel ABC's Family Confidential programme on Tuesday night, which offered a unique insight into the model's family life. Ten years later: Miranda of course went on to be one of Victoria's Secrets most celebrated models, seen here on the catwalk in New York in 2007 . At least there's no lingerie: Miranda bares almost all in a shoot for W magazine . It did not deliver the anticipated answer to why Miranda's close-knit family now feels that it has been shut out of the model's day-to-day life. They claim they have not seen Miranda or her son Flynn for more than a year - not since the break-up of her marriage to Hollywood star Orlando Bloom. But even her earliest of interviews provided a hint that Miranda wanted to leave her country upbringing behind for the bright lights of the world's biggest cities. Grimshaw asks Miranda why she wants to be a model at all, and her answer is simple: 'I just think it's be really fun. I love being with people and I love fashion.' In Gunnedah: Therese and John Kerr spoke warmly of how the family were all together in the norht-eastern NSW town, and how they yearned for that family closeness again . When Grimshaw asks 'And you like the idea of travelling', the answer is an immediate and resounding 'Yep!'. In Tuesday night's documentary, it was clear that the rest of the Kerr family did not share their famous family member's desire to see the world. The show started with Miranda's mother and father - Therese and John - reminiscing about the simple life in Gunnedah, a town in New South Wales (300 miles from Sydney). Throughout the interview they, as well as Miranda's grandmother Ann, are at pains to show that they are still country folk who extol the virtues of a simple life. Grandmother and brother: Ann says she fears that her great-grandson is missing out on important family time, while Matthew says both Miranda and their mother Therese are both women who like to be in control . John especially made his feelings clear, saying he wished Miranda had never gone into modelling and that she had married a 'nobody' instead of someone famous. He almost proudly told the story that he didn't know who Orlando Bloom was when told his daughter had started up a relationship, adding: 'I'd heard the name... I'm not one for movies.' He added: 'After what I know now I would rather she did just marry a nobody because you really can't get that family time by yourself.' And on the topic of his grandson Flynn, his hopes were once again homespun ones. Happy families: An undated photograph handed out by the ABC ahead of the Family Confidential programme shows the Kerrs - Matthew, Miranda, Therese and John - after one of Miranda's many early successes . Grown up: Matthew, Miranda, Therese and John are older in this photo, and Miranda has clearly grown into the beautiful looks that would take her around the world - and away from her family . He said: 'What I'd like to do as a grandfather would be to teach Flynn how to milk a cow, ride a horse, those country things.' Similarly, Miranda's grandmother Ann lamented the fact that she hadn't seen Flynn, now three, as often as she would have liked. She said: 'I miss the baby and I think he's missing out on family, that closeness that we have always had. It's very nice where they are but nothing like Australia, nothing, and I think hopefully Flynn might end up here. We just keep our fingers crossed.' A source tells MailOnline, however, that Miranda does stay close to her family. 'Miranda is totally committed to her family and in regular contact, she recently flew out her cousins to so they could spend Christmas together,' said the friend. 'Miranda directly employs her dad, brother, aunt and uncle. Her career was never going to keep her in Australia, to flourish she had to venture overseas, like many aspiring Australian models do. 'Miranda's connection to Australia is incredibly important to her and the documentary is not representative of her life. 'She does a remarkable job balancing an incredibly successful career with being a loving and dedicated mother.' With son Flynn: Miranda Kerr is seen with Therese and Ann at Sydney airport in May 2012 . Reflecting? Miranda posted this old shot of herself and her mother and grandmother on her Instagram page in December. The model has made no public remarks about her deteriorating relationship with either . The documentary touched on a possible explanation behind a family rift that has rent her once-close-knit family. In 2012, Miranda took over control of the Kora Organics skincare line, created by her but managed by mother Therese. Miranda made clear to all - including her family and those involved in her modelling career - that now that she was 30, she would be taking greater control of her life. Separated: The Kerr family say they haven't seen Miranda or her son Flynn for over a year . John spoke of his wife's determination and ambition, saying that 'she can get very blinkered' when going for something she wanted. Miranda's younger brother Matthew added that mother and daughter were the same in that they both 'like to be in control... they're leaders'. Since parting ways with Kora Organics, Therese has created her own called Divine by Therese Kerr, and says that while she realises her daughter's fame has helped get the 'message out', it has perhaps come at a cost to her family. Breaking the news: John, pictured here with his daughter and Orlando in August 2012, says it was the actor who confirmed to him the news of the couple's separation last year, over the telephone . 'You have to be in the media to be able . to get your message out, but then our little Flynny doesn't know what . it's like to walk outside without paparazzi,' she said. Therese, who said she used to speak to her daughter every single day, was teary as she explained  how she had to eventually 'let go' of Miranda. She said: 'What I have had to do is let go, and allow her to be assertive and lead her own life and I guess for any mum that's a little bit challenging sometimes to do that.' Missing his grandson: John says he hopes that Flynn grows up and wants to be with his 'nan and pop' Therese said she now sent texts to . Miranda to remind her that she was always there for her, but as she was . filmed doing so during the documentary, they were not always immediately . reciprocated. She said: 'We have been best friends for most of our life. We used to talk just about every day. 'I send her messages, just little texts to say ""I love you honey, let your little light shine, my arms are wrapped around you"".' Sexy selfie: Miranda posted this racy selfie on Thursday during what appeared to be a modelling shot . Before Miranda moved to New York at the . age of 25, her parents say they told the then budding supermodel 'the . day you think you're better than anyone else is the day you don't model . under our guidance'. Therese said these days her daughter's life was completely different, but it was important to stand 'true'. She said: 'Miranda's life is so different now [and] she's surrounded by yes people all the time. It's so important for me to be real, to be true, to be who she needs me to be.'","She would go on to become a famous Victoria's Secret Angel .

"Two men have been charged with the murders of a woman and her two daughters who mysteriously disappeared more than 40 years ago. Vincent O'Dempsey, 76, and Gary Reginald DuBois, 67, appeared separately in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday charged with the murders of Barbara McCulkin, 34, and her daughters Vicki, 13, and Leanne, 11. The three vanished on January 16, 1974 from their home in Highgate Hill, south of Brisbane, after two men were seen visiting the property. Their bodies have never been found. Both men were charged with three counts each of murder, three counts each of deprivation of liberty and other serious offences, over one of Australia's most notorious unsolved killings. 76-year-old Vincent O'Dempsey, who was charged with his co-accused 67-year-old Gary Dubois over the 40-year-old notorious cold murder case of Barbara McCulkin and her daughters Vicki and Leanne . Police say the two men have been charged with three counts of murder, three counts of deprivation of liberty and other serious offences . O'Dempsey's lawyer Terry O'Gorman told court he wanted to place on the record he'd told his client that because of the notoriety of the case, there was a risk someone in jail would come forward with false allegations that O'Dempsey had confessed to them. 'There is a very real risk that he'll be the subject of a jail `verbal' or a false allegation that in jail he confessed to a prisoner in relation to the subject matter of these charges,' Mr O'Gorman said. 'Mr O'Dempsey, on my advice, will not be discussing any aspect of this case with anyone whatsoever at the jail or the watchhouse.' O'Dempsey was formerly charged with the murder in 1980, but the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence . Mr O'Gorman added that police were 'on notice' that if they encouraged any prisoner to talk with Mr O'Dempsey without the discussion being recorded, it would be an issue at trial. DuBois' lawyer Peter Saggers said he echoed Mr O'Gorman's comments. Magistrate Chris Callaghan noted that he had no jurisdiction to grant either man bail and adjourned both cases to November 24. Both men were remanded in custody. DuBois' daughter was in court to support her father and declined to speak with reporters. Outside court, Mr O'Gorman said O'Dempsey would plead not guilty. 'I wish to make it clear on behalf of Mr O'Dempsey that what he's been saying since this cold case has been revived remains his case,' Mr O'Gorman told reporters. 'He is pleading not guilty. He declares his innocence of these charges.' Mr O'Gorman said he wanted to make it clear to anyone in jail seeking to gain favour, for example a parole advantage, that his client would be keeping silent. 'This case has the profile that calls out for a jail 'verbal',' he said. Ms McCulkin was the estranged wife of Billy McCulkin, a debt collector with underworld connections . He repeated his warning to police that it was 'on their head' if they encouraged a prisoner to talk to O'Dempsey without electronically recording the conversation. He said he would apply for bail in the Supreme Court on behalf of O'Dempsey but it would take longer than normal because of the large body of evidence involved. Mr Saggers said DuBois was in the same position and wouldn't be speaking to police or anyone else about the case. 'He denies the charge completely,' Mr Saggers said. 'He too will be making application for bail in the Supreme Court.' Meanwhile, the brother of murder victim Barbara McCulkin has broken his silence and revealed his sister was 'shaking with fear' before she vanished. Police charged two men, one of whose remote property was dug up earlier this year by cold case murder detectives, over one of Australia's most notorious unsolved killings. The men, Vincent O'Dempsey and Gary Dubois have been charged over the murder of Mrs McCulkin and her two daughters Vicki and Leanne, who have not been seen since January 16, 1974. In August, Police raided the rural property, which was an alpaca farm allegedly run by O'Dempseys as front for a marijuana operation . Graham Ogden, 77, told the Courier Mail he desperately wanted to find the bodies of his slain family members and honour them with a proper burial. 'What I’d like to know is where the remains are, get some sort of closure and have some burial perhaps. Even a few bones, a part of tissue, whatever it might be so we can give them some decent burial,' Mr Ogden said. He opened up about the last time the siblings talked, saying his sister appeared to be scared of what Mr McCulkin, Barbara's estranged husband, was up to. O'Dempsey was a former associate of Billy McCulkin. 'I haven't seen her since, she was terrified, she was shaking with fear,' he told the Courier Mail. Mr Ogden admitted to a lot of lost sleep and anxiety over the four-decade long case. 'It’s very difficult to understand why it’s taken 40 years to get this far,' he said. 'There’s been lies, cover-up, lies, cover-up.' Warwick detectives allegedly found barrels filled with bags of cannabis, as well as a loaded gun and over $570,000 in cash . After reopening the case in January this year - and after a murder charge in 1980 which was later dropped - detectives on Saturday charged O'Dempsey and Dubois with three counts of murder, three counts of deprivation of liberty and other serious offences. They will front Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday. Channel 9 footage showed 76-year-old O'Dempsey being driven into a Brisbane police station, where he was later formally charged. Detective Superintendent Steve Holahan said: 'It's extremely pleasing, particularly for the investigators. It's been a very intense sand relentless investigation.' He added the arrests were the result of years of hard work by many investigators and specialist officers, particularly since the renewed investigation began in January. Since the case was reopened, police have spoken to a number of people in Queensland, leading to them a rural property in Warwick, which O'Dempsey was operating. Brisbane housewife Barbara McCulkin and her daughters Leanne (left) and Vicky (right) vanished from their Highgate Hill home in inner Brisbane on January 16, 1974 and have never been seen again . In August, police raided the rural property, which was an alpaca farm allegedly run by O'Dempseys as front for a marijuana operation. Detectives from the Warwick Criminal Investigation Branch, Homicide Cold Case Unit and State Drug and Serious Crime Illicit Laboratories Investigation Team (ILIT) used an excavator to unearth a shipping container which they believe had been buried for years. LIT members used breathing apparatus to examine the contents of the container. They allegedly found barrels filled with bags of cannabis, as well as a loaded gun and over $570,000 in cash reports Courier Mail. Thomas 'Teddy' Martin was charged with drug and weapons offences. He has no connection to the McCulkin murder case. The McCulkin case has gripped Australia for over 40 years. Mrs McCulkin was the estranged wife of Jimmy McCulkin, a debt collector with underworld connections. Forty years after 13-year-old Vicky McCulkin (left) and 11-year-old Leanne (right) mysteriously disappeared, police have arrested Vincent O'Dempsey and Gary Dubois . On January 16, 1974, she  and her daughters Vicky and Leanne were at home in the Brisbane suburb of Highgate Hill. It was school holidays, and the girls had returned from a birthday party. One of the daughter's friends noticed two men visited the property at an unspecified time, and Mrs McCulkin and her two daughters vanished, never to be seen again. O'Dempsey and Dubois were charged with the three murders in 1980 but the charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence. Saturday's arrest of the two men who have long been the focus of the case is the most significant breakthrough since the former charges were dropped. Detective Holahan said that the arrests 'reinforce that the Queensland Police and committed to solving serious crimes, regardless of when they were committed or where.' Police have yet to reveal a motive or where they believe the alleged murders took place, however Det. Holahan said 'the investigation looked at all different motives and movements of persons of interest.' A number of potential witnesses gave evidence at Crime and Corruption Commission hearings which looked into the case earlier this year. 'The renewed investigation and use of coercive powers has gathered significant evidence without which the arrests would not have been possible,' Det Supt Holahan said. 'Todays arrest is extremely pleasing, but it's only the first in the prosecution stage,' he said.

"A teenager dressed as Slenderman was kicked out of a Oz Comic Con in Sydney for repeatedly touching members of the crowd. Slenderman is a fictional character that originated as an Internet meme. The character is depicted as a gangly, unnaturally tall man with a white and featureless face, who invariably dons a suit. It was responsible for a spate of moral panic earlier this year when it was linked to the stabbing of a 12-year-old girl in Wisconsin,as well as an arson attack by a young girl in Florida on her own family home. Last week, a contingent of Wisconsin residents successfully demanded that local costume shops ban the sale of Slenderman costumes for Halloween. Slenderman is a fictional character that originated as an Internet meme. The character is depicted as a gangly, unnaturally tall man with a white and featureless face, who invariably dons a suit . Morgan Geyser (left) and Anissa Weier (right) were charged as adults for stabbing a girl 19 times and leaving her in the woods. They said they had done the attack 'to please Slenderman' Daniel Simao,who dressed Slenderman for the Sydney Oz Comic-Con last week, told Daily Mail Australia the costume appealed to him because of his physical dimensions, rather than the macabre connotations. 'I'm 7-feet tall and pretty gangly. Slenderman works for my build, plus it's a pretty easy costume. I just bought the Lycra skin suit and wore a black suit over the top. You don't need to do makeup or anything. 'I obviously didn't choose it because of the messed up stuff that happened in America.' The costume was so convincing that at one stage, Stargate SG-1 actor Chris Judge ran from the stage he was doing a Q and A from because Simao began to approach. Security told Simao to leave as he was disrupting the session. Simao says it was his first time attending Oz Comic Con, though he had been to similar events in the same costume without any difficulties. 'I've been to Supernova and EB Expo with the Slenderman routine. It was never a problem. Funnily enough I attended both days, but it was only on the Sunday that I was asked to leave.' Simao was eventually kicked out by security for invading the personal space of members of the crowd. He said that while he did make physical contact with members of the public, he did not see it as inappropriate. 'I was softly poking people, pacing my palm on their shoulders then taking it away. I touched a couple of peoples hair. It wouldn't say it was improper.' 'For the most part, people were into it. Most of them asked for photographs aftrerwards or played along with it. They pretty much all freaked out.' Simao said he was approached for photos by countless members of the crowd . Simao says that first time attending Oz Comic Con, though he had been to similar events in the same costume without any difficulties . Simao said he made physical contact with members of the crowd, however it was not inappropriate . Nonetheless, Simao regrets his conduct. 'I regret it because I don't generally like getting too much attention. About 90 per cent of the reactions online have been negative. The discussions sort of snowballed. It made me reconsider.' Simao was warned at 1pm, when he found himself encircled by security. 'I can only see about four feet ahead of me in the suit, but when I took the mask off I could see they had surrounded me. They said I needed to stop invading peoples personal space.' After that, he says he was closely monitored. 'I hung by the Dance Central stage for a few hours after that. I didn't touch anybody else, and I was still being approached for photos. Eventually the guards came up and said I wasn't following the instructions and that I had to leave.' He believes the security overreacted, since he abided by their first warning. Simao added that he probably won't return to any other Comic-Con events, since anyone in a Slenderman costume will be 'discriminated against.' 'If it's the same security, I won't be going back. I'll be on their radar. It won't be much fun.' Simao said he regrets his behaviour because it garnered too much negative attention online . The event director of Oz Comic Con, Bernadette Neumann, confirmed that Simao was told to leave the event . The event director of Oz Comic Con, Bernadette Neumann, told Daily Mail Australia that a member of the crowd in a Slenderman costume was was asked to leave the event after 'inappropriate behaviour.' 'While management did not witness every single incident, the fact a number of complaints were made indicated there was an issue which needed to be addressed straight away,' she said. 'Oz Comic Con has a zero-tolerance policy on any form of harassment at these events. Anything that is reported to staff and security is immediately acted upon in the appropriate manner.' Comic-Con events have a strict code on harassment. In July, a group of  San Diego Comic Con organisers pressured the country's premier fan convention to crack down on unwanted physical contact at the events, which is generally a prominent complaint. In response, organisers at Comic-Con conventions in some cities have adopted tough anti-harassment policie, and an interactive Google map was created to collect and display the stories of harassment experienced by cosplayers at Comic-Con conventions.","Daniel Simao dressed as Slenderman, a fictional character that originated online, for the event in Sydney .

"Police in South Los Angeles have said a seven-year-old boy riding a bike was hit and killed by an ice cream truck on Wednesday night and the driver was then attacked by an angry mob. LAPD spokeswoman Officer Nuria Venegas says the truck hit the child shortly after 7 p.m. Wednesday, and he later died at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Police in LA, which has been dealing with scorching temperatures recently, say the child had been riding alongside the truck, and the collision was an accident. Shocking: The little boy died riding alongside the ice cream truck in South Los Angeles on Wednesday night . 'He was riding an electronic bike right next to the ice cream truck, apparently he may have slipped, got caught up underneath the truck, the rear wheels rolled over him,' Sgt. Timothy Colson told NBC Los Angeles. The crowd that attacked the driver threw bricks at him and one man is said by police to have threatened him witha knife. The driver managed to get to safety, suffering bruises and was taken to hospital as a precaution. The boy, known only as William, was heading home with his older brother when the accident happened.

Harris also admitted the boy's mother may have attacked the ice cream truck driver. 'She has every right to,' said Harris. Police are calling the incident a tragic accident and the driver was not put under arrest. “I walked outside. He was lying on the ground bleeding, so I just tried to comfort the family ’cause they was screaming,” said Linda Black, a witness to CBS Los Angeles. “It’s really sad because I have a kid that is younger than he is.”","Tragic accident unfolded in South Los Angeles on Wednesday evening .

"Should you be so inclined as to walk up to a random man in a fast-food joint, late at night, after consuming alcohol and grab him by the hand before slapping him across the face with a slice of pizza, do not be shocked when he hits you back. This is what happened to a young man from Ontario, Canada, who wanted to play what he saw as an innocent prank on a man that had been annoying a friend of his after a night out. Al Sutcliffe was filmed playing a ‘pizza slap’ prank on a man in a fast-food queue, but ended up being on the receiving end himself. Scroll down for video . Mr Sutcliffe claims the man in the blue cap had been 'f***ing' with his friend, so decided to play a 'prank' After grabbing hold of his hand in greeting, Mr Sutcliffe holds on and slaps the man across the face with a pizza . A short while later, the unsurprisingly furious victim comes back and knocks Mr Sutcliffe unconscious . The short clip, believed to have been recorded in Kitchener, Ontario, sees Mr Sutcliffe walk up to another young man, offering his hand to greet him. However, Mr Sutcliffe has other motives, and instead of shaking the young man’s hand, he slaps him across the face with a slice of pizza. On his YouTube page, Mr Sutcliffe describes the idea behind walking up to a stranger and slapping them across the face with a cheese pie as: ‘Buddy was f***ing with my buddy so I decided to pizza slap him!’ The stunned ‘pizza slap’-victim shouts abuse back in disbelief at what just happened, while Mr Sutcliffe laughs him off. Before: The video was uploaded by AL Sutcliffe, pictured, who appears to be sitting in a pizza slice shop at around 2am, surrounded by young people under the influence of alcohol . Aftermath: Moments after Mr SUtcliffe has 'pizza slapped' the young man in the queue, the 'victim' comes from behind, punching him in the head so he hits the table . Recovery: A few minutes later, Mr Sutcliffe is helped by witnesses, in particular a young lady seen on camera . Warning: Mr Sutcliffe's video, which has more than 260,000 views at the time of writing, posted that ' slapping people across the face with a slice of pizza could potentially get you sucker punched from behind' It does not take long before the slapper becomes the slappee when the angry victim knocks Mr Sutcliffe out cold on the table. According to the video, which has now gone viral, Mr Sutcliffe was unconscious for two minutes before being helped by other diners in the shop. ‘WARNING: Slapping people across the face with a slice of pizza could potentially get you sucker punched from behind,’ Mr Sutcliffe writes in a ‘disclaimer’ on his page. ‘You've been warned...’ Mr Sutcliffe’s clip has had more than 260,000 views since it was uploaded on Sunday.","Video showing Canadian man's 'pizza slap prank fail'  goes viral .

"Sportsmail continues to review the candidates for William Hill's Sports Book of the Year award for 2014. Here CHRIS WAUGH looks at the autobiography of former Wales and Lions star Gareth Thomas, who is one of the most high-profile sports stars to make public that he is gay. Author: Gareth Thomas and Michael Calvin . Publisher: Ebury Press . Rating: 4.5/5 . ‘My suicide would be measured, civilised. I would gradually become incapable, and slip gently into the water... So much for the fantasy fatality... I couldn’t follow it through.’ When an autobiography opens up with a chapter about one of the numerous times a Welsh rugby icon tried to kill himself due to a burning secret he felt he couldn’t reveal to society, you know that you are in for a hard-hitting read. Yet somehow, despite learning of the struggles Thomas has been through in his personal and professional life, you do not find yourself downhearted. Instead, Proud is captivating, revealing and simply brilliant to read. It is also about so much more than a person’s sexuality, because that is not the only thing which defines them. Gareth Thomas has written his autobiography, giving insight into his rugby career and personal battles . Thomas racked up a breathtaking 40 tries in 100 caps for Wales’s rugby union side, including more than 50 as captain. He represented the British and Irish Lions in three Tests, captaining them in two of those. He played for Bridgend, Pontypridd, Cardiff, Celtic Warriors, Toulouse and Cardiff Blues during a stellar professional career before converting to rugby league and representing the Crusaders and his home nation of Wales on four occasions. He is a deep and fascinating person, one who gives a unique insight into what it is like to captain one of the world’s finest sides. The dark moments of Thomas’s life reveal so much about a complicated character. He is not your archetypal sportsman who lives his very public persona – Thomas admits in his book in fact that, until he came out in 2009, he lived a dual life. Publicly, Thomas was ‘Alfie’ – a man’s man, who ‘loved the craic. He drank to excess, picked fights in pubs, and played to the gallery by rampaging around town in a range of fancy-dress masks.’ But privately, he was holding back a secret, one he felt he could not reveal to the world. The Welsh rugby captain was gay, but did not believe he could be accepted in the hyper-masculine world of professional sport as such. It was that secret which led Thomas to try and drown himself in his swimming pool at his home in Toulouse, where he played between 2004 and 2007. It was that secret which compelled Thomas to stand on a cliff edge in south Wales, to remove all his clothes and come within an inch of jumping to his death. However, when it comes to rugby, Thomas gives a unique insight that only a man who has played in such high-profile games as he could. Explaining that when he captained Wales he was ‘nothing without the team,’ he goes through his leadership style and reveals how to skipper a side to Grand Slam glory. It is fascinating and something all rugby fans should endeavour to read. Proud is up there with the most honest books I have ever picked up. Thomas regularly admits to self-loathing throughout his life; to cheating on his wife while on trips to the gay scene in London to ‘satisfy’ his urges and keep his secret hidden; to turning to drink to hide his inner-battle with himself; and to being a ‘dreadful’ husband. What’s more, this is not an account for which Thomas wants pity – he is just being brutally honest. He knows the mistakes he has made, but he is also aware of the pressures and expectations put upon the captain of a rugby-mad nation. Thomas and Michael Owen lift the Six Nations trophy at the Millennium Stadium in March 2005 . Thomas scores a try against Wellington during the Lions tour of New Zealand in 2005 . The Wales captain celebrations a victory over France at the Stade de France in 2005 . Admitting that the brutal reaction of Castleford rugby league fans to his homosexuality in March 2010  was the ‘manifestation of the worst nightmare imaginable’, Thomas in some ways proves he was vindicated in keeping his sexuality secret. The world has moved on an awful lot since homosexuality was deemed unacceptable, but unfortunately there are still some out there who cannot accept people for what they are. Thomas consistently states that he is no ‘hero’ for 'coming out' – but he is most certainly a trailblazer at the very least. The first few professional sportspeople to do so will always be the bravest individuals and will always face the most difficult task, and it is for that reason that Proud can be an inspiration to all homosexual athletes. The Welshman has been to hell and back because of his previously hidden sexuality, but he reveals a sense of an inner peace now that his secret is so public. It was extremely difficult, excruciatingly painful and took him many years to find – yet Thomas is now at one with himself. He knows who he is, and he is proud of that, something which comes across eloquently on every single page. This book is as inspiring as it is moving and depressing. A must read and, as brilliant as I imagine the other nominees must be, I would be gobsmacked if this did not pick up the William Hill Sports Book of the Year award. It is breathtaking. Look out for reviews of the other books in the running for the award thoughout this week.","Gareth Thomas - Proud is autobiography of former Wales captain .

"A soldier who died following an SAS training exercise in the Brecon Beacons suffered multiple organ failure, an inquest heard today. Corporal James Dunsby died in hospital 17 days after collapsing on South Wales’s highest mountain, Pen Y Fan, on one of the hottest days of the year. Aberdare Cororner’s Court was told that the 31-year-old was one of six soldiers who collapsed during the military exercise on July 13. Fellow reservists Edward John Maher and Craig John Roberts also died after falling ill during training exercise for the SAS’s tough selection process. Tragedy: Corporal James Dunsby, a member of the Army Reserves, died 17 days after falling ill during SAS selection training in the Brecon Beacons from 'multiple organ failure' an inquest heard today . The armed forces have long used the Brecon Beacons for exercises as its rugged terrain and harsh conditions provide ideal preparation for combat situations. It is thought the reservists were carrying out an exercise known as the 'Fan Dance' - which involves marching up 886-metre high Pen Y Fan and down the other side carrying a weighted pack and rifle, before doing the route in reverse, in a set time. North Walian and teacher Lance Corporal Roberts was pronounced dead on the mountainside, while Lance Corporal Maher and Cpl Dunsby were taken to hospital. L/Cpl Maher died three hours later in Merthyr Tydfil’s Prince Charles Hospital, while Cpl Dunsby remained in critical condition. The political science graduate was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, which has the the largest single-floor critical care unit in the world and is home to the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine. Fellow soldiers: Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, pictured left, and Lance Corporal Edward Maher, pictured right, both died . during the SAS endurance test in the Brecon Beacons during the . heatwave . Pen y Fan is home to the gruelling 'Fan Dance', which involves would-be special forces personnel marching up the mountain, down the other side and back again carrying a weighted pack and rifle - then doing the route in reverse in a set time . Despite the efforts of doctors and the hospital’s state-of-the-art facilities, Cpl Dunsby was pronounced dead 17 days later on July 30. During the opening of Cpl Dunsby's inquest today, Coroner Louise Hunt said results of a post-mortem examination gave the official cause of death as 'multiple organ failure'. Ms Hunt said further tests needed to be carried out and stressed the purpose of the inquest was 'not to proportion blame'. She promised investigations would be conducted thoroughly, with medical reports, witnesses testimonies and video footage playing a key role. She added: 'It’s important that the full circumstances are addressed to the families so they can understand what happened to their loved ones.' Proceedings were adjourned to September 3 when an interim inquest hearing will take place. It is expected this will give an update on Dyfed Powys Police’s investigation into the deaths. The date for a full inquest is not yet known, but Ms Hunt said all three cases should be heard together. The men became ill close to Pen y Fan, which at 2,900 feet is the highest mountain in South Wales. Army chiefs say the rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and mentally for war .","Corporal James Dunsby was one of six soldiers to collapse on the exercise .

"Hearing voices: Martin Montano apparently thought he heard a voice telling him to 'get the clones out' from his mother's house. So he took both his mother and another person to a bridge over the Rio Grande and attempted to throw both over . A New Mexico man stabbed, severely beat and kidnapped his mother and another person, then threw his mother off a bridge into the Rio Grande in broad daylight after he said he heard voices coming through the television telling him to go to his mother's house and 'get the clones out,' according to a criminal complaint. Martin Montano, 26, told detectives that he tossed his 61-year-old mother, Hope Montano, from a bridge in Albuquerque on Tuesday after stabbing and choking her at her Albuquerque home, complaint said. Witnessed told police that after they saw Martin Montano of Albuquerque take his mother out of a trunk and throw her over the bridge, he tried to toss over another beaten and stabbed victim, later identified as Francisco Dominguez, the complaint said. But police said witnesses stopped Montano, who then fled in his vehicle. Dominguez, believed to be a housemate of the mother, was left on the side of the road near the bridge. Both badly beaten victims were taken to an Albuquerque hospital where they are listed in stable condition, police said. Martin Montano was later stopped and arrested by police. A criminal complaint said Martin Montano told police the couple were 'clones' of his family and his real family was living underground. He told police that he entered the house by jumping the fence and getting into a fight with Dominguez, then stabbed him multiple times with a large brown kitchen knife. Montano told police, the complaint said, that Dominguez yelled for help from Hope Montano but when she came out Montano 'did not think she was his mom.' The report said Montano then stabbed his mother 'in the neck and she just kept going.' He also tried to wrapped a pillow case around his mother's neck and 'tried to choke her out ... (but she) just kept going,' according to the complaint. Getting rid of the clones: Montano threw his 61-year-old mother off of this bridge over the Rio Grande, and attempted to throw another person before being stopped by witnesses . Busted: Montano being arrested by responding officers. Both victims are in stable condition at an Albuquerque hospital . He admitted that he also beat his victims with a large rock and a pole, police said. Montano told investigators he place both victims in the trunk of a car and drove to an overpass to throw 'one of the clones in the river.' He faces multiple charges, including attempted murder and aggravated burglary. It's unclear if Montano had an attorney. Records show that Montano was arrested in August 2012 for false imprisonment and battery against his mother. In that case, Montano was seen by officers restraining his mother from opening the door to allow police in and pushing her to the ground shouting, 'you have demons in you.' Police said Montano's mother declined to give a written statement at the time but requested information on getting a protective order against her son.","26-year-old Martin Montano took his 61-year-old mother Hope Montano, and Francisco Dominguez to a bridge over the Rio Grande and attempted to throw both off .

"The father of bashing victim Josh Hardy is said to be ‘full of forgiveness', asking that a candle is also lit for his son's alleged killer, because  will also be changed forever’. Melbourne university student, 21-year-old student, was killed last Saturday when he was brutally bashed  outside a McDonald’s in St Kilda, in what is believed to have been an unprovoked attack. Investment banker Kyle Zandipour, 26, has been charged with Mr Hardy's murder following the incident where '[Mr Hardy] was grabbed by the arm and violently thrown to the ground head first, and then kicked to the head,’ according to Detective Sergeant Sol Solomon. He lapsed into unconsciousness immediately and was taken to Alfred Hospital, where he died from his injuries an hour later. Scroll down for video . Joshua Hardy (right) was killed on the early hours of Saturday morning hour after celebrating the end of semester with his beloved little sister, Rebecca (left) - pictured on their last night together . The Aboriginal flag is flying at half-mast at Melbourne Grammar School, where Mr Hardy attended high school, as a mark of respect . Hardy’s father, David, has shown mercy and compassion for both Kyle Zandipour and the man who accompanied Zandipour before the attack. The man was identified by CCTV footage and provided a statement for police, but will not face charges. The victim's father is concerned for the men and their families, according to a report from the headmaster of Melbourne Grammar School, Roy Kelley. Josh Hardy, originally from Darwin, completed Year Twelve at Melbourne Grammar School in 2011, where the Aboriginal flag is currently flying at half mast in memoriam. 'Like brother like sister' Rebecca (left) posted humorously on Facebook last month, in a sweet moment with her brother, Joshua (right) who was tragically killed on Saturday morning . The headmaster published a reflection after learning of the former Grammar student’s tragic death, describing a conversation he had with David Hardy. ‘I (had)… the difficult task of returning to my office to telephone the parents of Josh Hardy… who had been tragically killed over the weekend,’ wrote Mr Kelley. ‘His father, David and I shared memories of Josh which resulted in the expected mix of tears and laughter.’ Joshua's family has paid an emotional tribute to their beloved son who was killed suddenly, and are campaigning to raise awareness about the devastating impact of violence . However, Mr Kelley explained that the ‘most remarkable’ part of the conversation came from the ‘incredibly humane reaction’ Mr Hardy had when he asked for special favour. ‘In stating that I was going to leave my office to go to the Chapel of St Peter to light a candle for Josh and his family, he asked for a special favour. ‘He asked me to also light a candle for the two men who were responsible for Josh’s death and for their families, given the fact their lives would also now be affected forever, just as his had been.’ Mr Hardy (right) is remembered by his friends for his good humour and sense of fun . A top bloke: Melbourne University student Joshua Hardy died in hospital after allegedly being kicked in the head outside a McDonald's restaurant early Saturday morning . The headmaster says the father was ‘full of forgiveness’ for the perpetrators of the heinous crime. ‘He could well have been forgiven for venting strong feelings of the need for revenge, yet it was clear… that he was full of forgiveness, despite what had happened to his son.’ The message was shared on the ‘Justice4JoshHardy’ Facebook page, which ‘is designed to share thoughts on how something positive can come from the tragic and senseless act of violence that killed Josh Hardy.’ Messages of support poured in, responding to the sentiments shared by Mr Hardy’s father. Joshua (second from left) has been remembered as a keen sportsman and a leader, inspiring the indigenous students he cared for as an AIME mentor at university . ‘Beautiful words. No wonder Josh was so well respected & loved when he was being guided by such amazing parents (& family) ,’ wrote Kelly McSkimming. ‘In times like these it's usually your friends & family that give you strength, but I feel that the strength and love being shown by David, Milly, Bec and all their families is what is helping us all get through this tragic time.’ Earlier this week, David Hardy implored every person to reach out to their loved ones, saying, ‘ring your family and tell that that you love them.’ “We know that was the last thing we said to Josh before the stupid night,’ he told Nine News. Joshua Hardy's family at his death, lamenting the bright future the eager, driven young man had ahead of him. He had aspirations to become a lawyers and help members of the indigenous community facing injustice . ‘It’s a senseless act of violence that has cut short a very special young man’s life,” he said, according to Herald Sun. Josh Hardy’s devastated loved ones continue to pay tribute to him, and are campaigning to raise awareness about the devastating impact of violence. ‘How do we make sense of this tragic loss, violently kicked and stomped, to death??? ... We can't, at all!!!,’ wrote his uncle. An third-year Arts student and popular football player, Joshua Hardy has been described by friends on social media as 'a truly genuine, spirited and kind-hearted young man' ‘Perhaps, if anything, as men, women, and children, we can condemn all violence, reinforce that every action has consequences, some can be fatal, and tell our children that we love them!’ Just hours before his death Mr Hardy had been celebrating the end of semester with his beloved sister, Rebecca, a precious last moment captured in a photograph of their beaming faces. They siblings shared a close bond, both living away from their hometown of Darwin at the Melbourne University residence, Trinity College. 'Rest easy my precious xx' Ms Hardy wrote on Facebook, alongside the photograph of the pair together on their last night together. Mr Hardy's loved ones desperately want to make changes so the streets are safe and other families do not have to experience the same devastating loss. The Justice for Josh Hardy campaign hopes to raise awareness and educate people, to ensure no one else has to experience the loss of a loved one from a 'random assault'. 'We need to educate our school age sons to use words rather than fists or feet. 'We need our young men to understand that thoughtless actions can have very final and devastating consequences.'

"A dormant volcano buried two miles (3.2 km) beneath Stoke-on-Trent could supply heat to homes in the UK city by 2019. There is a layer of hot rocks at this depth that heats water to more than 105°C (220°F). And the City Council has announced it is planning to invest £52m ($85m) in a geothermal district heating network (DHN) to bring this heated water to the surface. It could then be used to supply nearby homes and buildings with cheaper fuel. Houses in Stoke-on-Trent could be heated by geothermal energy by 2019. A dormant volcano 350-million-years-old is believed to be heating rocks and water to more than 105°C (220°F) underground. This heated water would be brought to the surface by a geothermal district heating network (DHN). Pictured is a DHN in Paris . According to the Stoke Sentinel, work on the DHN will begin in 2016 and is expected to be completed by March 2019. District heating involves using pipes to transfer heat in the form of hot water or steam from one place to another. In the case of geothermal district heating, this involves bringing heated water up from underground. Beneath Earth’s crust, geothermal energy is stored in the form of heat. This can heat subsurface rocks and, in turn, heat water stored in underground reservoirs - or aquifers. Bringing this water to the surface can provide a sustainable source of heat for homes, as the water underground is replenished. Geothermal energy can be used not only to provide heat, but also to provide electricity in the form of geothermal power generation. While the UK does not have the resource potential of volcanic regions like New Zealand and Iceland for such power generation, it has enough geothermal energy underground to make heat-only projects a viable option. A network of pipes would take supply homes in Hanley, Stoke and Festival Park with heated water from this sleeping volcano. The scheme would apparently lift 1,000 homes out of so-called 'fuel poverty' - a term used to describe households that can't reasonably afford to keep their homes warm - save 11,700 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year, and safeguard 1,300 jobs. While geothermal DHN’s are fairly common in Europe, this would be only the UK’s second such system. The first was built in Southampton in 2012. The heat would be pumped to buildings through seven miles (11km) of pipes, providing a cheaper form of heating than is currently available. Each home would have a pair of pipes connected to the network, which would eliminate the need for a conventional boiler in the home. The pipes will be under the council’s control, but the private sector will be tasked to construct and maintain the £17m ($28m) geothermal well. The hot water comes from heated rocks that are linked to a 350 million-year-old volcano in North Staffordshire. District heating involves using pipes to transfer heat in the form of hot water or steam from one place to another. In the case of geothermal district heating, this involves bringing heated water up from underground where it is heated by rocks. This water can be pumped down before being returned to the surface . While no one is entirely sure why the rocks are heated, its believed this dormant volcano is the cause. ‘With deep geothermal, you need a particular kind of geology, with rocks that are at a higher temperature than normal,’ Professor Peter Styles from Keele University told the Sentinel. ‘But as you need to be able to extract the heat through water, you also need permeable rocks.’ He added: ‘It’s a bit like having a hot water bottle in the ground.’ A network of pipes would take supply homes in Hanley, Stoke and Festival Park (shown) with heated water from this sleeping volcano. The scheme would apparently lift 1,000 homes out of so-called 'fuel poverty' - a term used to describe households that can't reasonably afford to keep their homes warm . While geothermal DHN’s are fairly common in Europe this would be only the UK’s second such system, with the first in Southampton. The heat would be pumped to bildings through seven miles (11km) of pipes (comparable network shown in Iceland), providing a cheaper form of heating than is currently available .","Houses in Stoke-on-Trent could be heated by geothermal energy by 2019 .

"Apparent suicide: Rick Halprin, a criminal lawyer who defended the Chicago mob, was found dead at his apartment . A criminal lawyer who defended an infamous leader of the Chicago mob has been found dead at his apartment after apparently committing suicide. Rick Halprin, 73, died on Tuesday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head or neck, according to a preliminary report from the medical examiner. Halprin, 73, is famous for defending mob chief Joey 'The Clown' Lombardo, the suspected boss of crime organization, the Chicago Outfit. In 2009, Lombardo was sentenced to . life in prison after being found guilty of murder, racketeering, . extortion, and loan sharking. Halprin . was found at his condo in Hyde Park, Chicago at 10am on Tuesday by police officers   who had gone to the home to serve an eviction notice. The Vietnam veteran and former professional hockey player had 'loved the courtroom' one of his three ex-wives, Robyn Douglass, told the Chicago Tribune. Ms Douglass, a retired actress, had tried to get Mr Halprin to retire but he refused and she moved to California. She told the paper: 'The thing about Rick was he was so well-respected. He was a guy who was committed to the Constitution. 'He was good at it and he knew he was good at it. They knew it was going to be a professional fight with no shenanigans.' Career criminal: Joseph 'Joey the Clown' Lombardo (pictured in a police mugshot several decades ago and more recently, right) was Mr Halprin's most infamous client . Mr Halprin is survived by his daughter. No details for funeral services were immediately available. MailOnline was awaiting a call from the Cook County Coroner's Office. The seasoned defense lawyer defended Joseph Lombardo during his 2007 trial for racketeering, extortion, and loan sharking. The Chicago Outfit - also known as the Chicago Mob and Capone family - is a notorious crime organization stretching back to the 1910s. At its height, the syndicate reached from Los Angeles to D.C., Florida and across the Midwest. During Prohibition, the group was lead by Al Capone who made money from bootlegging. A deadly rivalry sprung up with other gangs, in particular the outfit run by George 'Bugs' Moran. The conflict blew up in the St Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929 in a drive-by battle with Tommy guns which led to a number of deaths on both sides. The mob suffered a heavy crackdown on its activities during the Kennedy era in the 1960s and subsequently has long been subject to conspiracy theories over JFK and his brother Senator Robert Kennedy's assassinations. The Outfit was prolific in the control of Las Vegas casinos, skimming millions of dollars in profits. It is believed some of these millions were funneled into the Old Neighborhood Italian American Club in Chicago, still a suspected hang-out for aging mobsters. The government's Operation Family Secrets broke the back of the Chicago Outfit, leading to several life terms for senior members including Joseph Lombardo. The Chicago outfit has been portrayed in a number of movies including Martin Scorcese's  Casino starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Sharon Stone. Lombardo, a career criminal with the notorious gang the Chicago Outfit, was a high-ranking member of the crime family. After being released from prison in 1992 after serving a decade for extortion and attempted bribery, federal investigators once again turned their attention to Lombardo. He was indicted in 2005 for his role in one of 18 murders along with other members of the Chicago Outfit as part of Operation Family Secrets. The indictment charged 14 mobsters and 11 mob associates with racketeering conspiracy involving the murders. The murders include the June 1986 hit . on Tony 'The Ant' Spilotro, the mob’s man in Las Vegas for two decades. He and his brother, Michael, were beaten to death and buried in a . cornfield. The Spilotro case became the focus of the 1995 Martin . Scorsese movie Casino, in which Joe Pesci played a character based on . Tony Spilotro. As the FBI closed in on Lombardo, he went on the run. During this time, he sent letters to his lawyer Rick Halprin, in which Lombardo said he would surrender if he got a separate trial from other mobsters. Halprin said at the time that he had recognized the signature but had no clue to his client's whereabouts.

"In what some would call an unlucky outcome a man has lost the right to part of his former wife's $6 million lotto winnings from five years ago. The court battle over the cash has been dragged out over the past two years, but this month it was determined the man was not entitled to any of his ex-wife's money. Mr Eufrosin - the name he and his ex-wife were given for legal reasons - already had his claim denied in May last year but this month the panel rejected it for the second time, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. The decision went to a three-judge bench from the NSW Family Court, who discovered the golden ticket was purchased six months after the couple had split. Scroll down for video . A court has ruled that a man has no entitlement to his ex-wife's $6 million lottery winnings . Mrs Eufrosin had been buying lotto tickets for years before she was married, and bought the one that would win her $6 million while on holidays. Each week her sister reportedly gave her money to put towards the cash pool, and so got a cool $1 million share in the cash when Mrs Eufrosin won. The case was denied on the basis that it could not be proven the purchase of the ticket came from joint funds solely related to the couple's income, as other contributors were Mrs Eufrosin's sister and also a family company. Mrs Eufrosin, given that name for legal reasons, purchased the ticket six months after the separation . Justice Janet Stevenson 'The money used by the wife to purchase the winning ticket could have come from any one of these sources or multiple combinations thereof.' 'In my view, the husband cannot simply assert that the purchase money came from ""joint funds"",' she added when speaking in May last year. Mr Eufrosin launched an appeal against the Family Court - but was dismissed by the bench made up of Justices Stephen Thackray, Peter Murphy and Murray Aldridge . The man was also ordered to pay his ex-wife's legal fees.","The court case has been ongoing for more than two years .
Mrs Eufrosin, the name used for legal reasons, won the $6 million in 2009 .

"As many as a quarter of obese children tested using the body mass index - which measures height against weight, could be missed, scientists warn . As many as a quarter of obese children tested using the body mass index could be missed putting them at risk of developing diabetes and heart disease, scientists have warned. While the BMI correctly identifies obese children it does not measure a child's percentage body fat. The test, which uses a person's height and weight to determine whether they are obese, does not measure waist size. The larger a person's waist measurement, the more likely they are to suffer obesity-related diseases, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease. It is that failure of the test that has led scientists at the US's Mayo Clinic to warn relying on BMI alone could mean large numbers of children at risk of obesity-related disease could be missed under the radar. Dr Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, senior study author from the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, said: 'If we are using BMI to find out which children are obese, it works if the BMI is high, but what about the children who have a normal BMI but do have excess fat? 'Those parents may get a false sense of reassurance that they do not need to focus on a better weight for their children.' In the study, published in Paediatric Obesity, the researchers used 37 eligible studies that evaluated 53,521 patients, aged between four and 18. It is the first systematic review to assess the diagnostic performance of BMI to identify excess body fat as compared with other techniques considered as standard to measure obesity. Scroll down for video . They  include skin-fold thickness measurement and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry - where X-ray beams can be used to measure  body composition and fat content. Dr Asma Javed, the study's first author, said: 'It is known that childhood obesity can lead to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 'Our research raises the concern that we very well may be missing a large group of children who potentially could be at risk for these diseases as they get older. 'We hope our results shine a light on this issue for physicians, parents, public health officials and policymakers.' While the BMI correctly identifies obese children it does not measure a child's percentage body fat.The test, which uses a person's height and weight to determine whether they are obese, does not measure waist size. The larger a person's waist measurement, the more likely they are to suffer obesity-related diseases . The findings of this study mirror results found in past research examining adults, carried out by Dr Lopez-Jimenez. Over several years he and a team of researchers discovered what they call normal weight obesity. It describes a situation where adults have a normal BMI but a large percentage of body fat. Normal weight obesity shares some of the same risks as obesity, including pre-diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular death. He said: 'The lesson is that we need additional research in children to determine the potential impact of having high fat in the setting of normal BMI to recognise this issue and perhaps justify the use of body composition techniques to detect obesity at an early stage.'","BMI is a relative measure of weight based on height and body mass .
It calculates whether a person is underweight, normal, overweight or obese .
But the test does not measure percentage body fat or waist circumference .
The larger a person's waist measurement the more prone they are to obesity-related diseases including diabetes and heart disease .
Scientists at the Mayo Clinic say 25% of obese children could be missed by BMI tests because they appear to be a normal weight but have high body fat ."
"His party has been rising in the polls. And now Nigel Farage hopes Ukip will enter the pop charts with a song by former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read. The party leader called on supporters to buy the party anthem, which warns of ‘illegal immigrants in every town’ and looks forward to ‘when Nigel is at Number 10’. Scroll down for video . Mike Read attended the 2014 UKIP Conference at Doncaster Racecourse last month and has now recorded a song for the eurosceptic party . But Mr Read was yesterday forced to defend the track sung in a mock Jamaican accent against claims that it is racist. The song raises the issue of immigration with the lyrics: ‘Leaders committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in, illegal immigrants in every town, stand up and be counted Blair and Brown.’ It continues: ‘Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again – when Nigel is at No 10.’ Other lyrics include digs at the European Union such as ‘With the EU we must be on our mettle, want to change our lawnmowers and our kettles. The EU live in wonderland, tried to ban bent bananas and British jam, we don't want jam the EU way, jam yesterday tomorrow but never today.’ Mr Read, a former Conservative supporter, also warns against trusting the Prime Minister, singing: ‘The British people have been let down, that's why Ukip is making ground. From Crewe to Cleethorpes, from Hull to Hendon, they don't believe Cameron's referendum. ‘The other parties will count the cost, in Eastleigh, Thanet, Thurrock and Boston, Labour and Tories shaking in their boots when Ukip kick them up the grass roots.’ Mr Read's song has sparked accusations of racism for using a mock Jamaican accent . The song raises the issue of immigration with the lyrics: ‘Leaders committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in' Mr Read has launched a bid for chart success with a song singing the praises of Ukip and its leader Nigel Farage . The song also mentions Mr Farage’s love of ‘fags and beer’ and jokes about the frequency of his appearances on the BBC’s Question Time. Mr Read yesterday said there was ‘nothing remotely racist’ about the song and said critics had ‘lost their sense of humour’. He told Sky News: ‘It's a satire and a bit of fun. It's not terribly serious. It wouldn't have sounded very good sung in a Surrey accent.’ He said that if he had done an Australian song he would have put on an Australian accent. Ukip’s Commonwealth spokesman Winston McKenzie defended the song. Appearing on Newsnight last night he said: ‘Ever since the beginning of time – the Beatles, Elvis, the Rolling Stones – they have taken off the black man. ‘What he has done is fantastic and the PC brigade have to grow up and get with it. The guy has made a song.’ Ukip leader Nigel Farage has called on the party's supporters to get the song to Number 1 in the charts . Ukip's Commonwealth spokesman Winston McKenzie attacked the 'PC brigade' which had criticised the song . Mr Read, who currently hosts an afternoon show on BBC Berkshire, spent more than a decade at Radio 1. He hit the headlines in 1984 when he refused to play the Frankie Goes to Hollywood single, Relax, because he objected to its lyrics. A BBC spokesman said he had not breached the corporation's guidelines on impartiality by recording the song in support of the anti-EU party. The song, which is being sold for 79p, yesterday reached as high as number 17  on the iTunes chart. Some bookmakers put the track at 50-1 to go straight into the charts at Number 1 on Sunday. Mr Farage posted on Twitter: ‘Help get the UKIP Calypso by The Independents to Number 1.’ The song had mixed reviews on Amazon. One wrote: ‘My god, the musical equivalent of the Ebola virus. Anyway, isn't calypso music a bit foreign for Ukip?’ Another review said: ‘A triumph. What a blend of cultures, using a Jamaican style to highlight some very British issues, and I would never have guessed the signer wasn't a native of the Caribbean but top pop DJ Mike Read.’ A further comment said: ‘John, Paul, George, Ringo, Farage.’ Some criticised Mr Read’s accent on the song. One wrote: ‘Surely we should have moved on from white men singing in funny accents? I found this song a sad reflection of a sick society.’ ‘Pretty sick with faux Jamaican accent. Shows UKIP in its true light as a nasty racist party,’ added another. In May, Ukip had to cancel a ‘carnival of colour’ with a steel band in Croydon after it descended into farce. The event was supposed to demonstrate the party welcomed members from all ethnic minorities, but rows broke out between supporters and demonstrators. The steel band stopped playing and packed up after they found out the event was in support of the party. Taxpayers’ money where does it go? Not even George Osborne knows, when we're in power and we engage, there will be no tax on the minimum wage. Leaders committed a cardinal sin, open the borders let them all come in, illegal immigrants in every town, stand up and be counted Blair and Brown. Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. The British people have been let down, that’s why Ukip is making ground, from Crewe to Cleethorpes, outer Hendon, they don't believe Cameron's referendum. Coalition could be a fact, with any party we could make a pact, stop telling lies about us do, and we’ll stop telling the truth about you. Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. Though our pensions scheme is in a mess, we need money for the NHS, to Jean-Cleade Juncker we’re giving away £55m a day. Oh what a farce he won the vote, this is my favourite Juncker quote, he looked a reporter straight in the eye and said “when things get serious it's time to lie”. Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. The EU live in wonderland, tried to ban bent bananas and British jam, we don't want jam the EU way, jam yesterday tomorrow but never today . The daily polls suggest somehow, Ukip are the third party now, in the euro elections we were so immersed, we weren't the third party we were the first . Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. With the government sitting on the fence, Ukip policy makes more sense, to get out of Europe is our target, Commonwealth not common market. Other parties please take note, Ukip is not a protest vote, so mark your cross and by word of mouth, tell them what to do in Thanet South. Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. With the EU we must be on our mettle, want to change our lawnmowers and our kettles, our hairdryers, smart phones and vacuum cleaners, but Ukip is wise to their misdemeanours. Farage likes his fags and beer, but there is one thing I want to get clear, now I like Nigel, he’s a friend of mine, but he appears more than Dimbleby on Question Time. Oh yes, when we take charge, and the new prime minister is Farage, we can trade with the world again when Nigel is at No. 10. The other parties will count the cost, in Eastleigh, Thanet, Thurrock and Boston, Labour and Tories shaking in their boots when Ukip kick them up the grass roots. Meanwhile down at Clacton-on-Sea, Ukip are making history, Douglas Carswell, we're quite adamant, will be the first MP in parliament.

During the awards ceremony, she was seen wiping tears from her eyes as Helt spoke to the audience about homelessness in the U.S. and Los Angeles while host Jimmy Fallon held the microphone. He also told viewers how they could donate to the homeless center, while Miley's Facebook page was updated with a video explaining how they could give cash.

Mr Boise unsuccessfully asked Judge Campbell to give Helt one more chance to meet the terms of his probation, saying his client grew up in poverty and has never known stability or discipline.

"Nigel Farage today said immigrants suffering from ‘life-threatening diseases’ should not be allowed into Britain. The Ukip leader defended his call for foreigners suffering from HIV to be banned from moving to the UK – and said he would stop ‘people with tuberculosis too’. Douglas Carswell, the party’s first MP, was left struggling to defend the remarks today after using his victory speech late last night to urge his party to speak with ‘compassion’. Mr Carswell’s highly respected father Wilson Carswell also diagnosed the first confirmed cases of HIV/AIDS in Uganda and inspired the character Dr Garrigan in Giles Foden's novel The Last King of Scotland. Scroll down for video . Douglas Carswell urged Ukip to show 'compassion' - just hours before Nigel Farage was forced to defend remarks calling for all immigrants with 'life threatening diseases' to be blocked from coming to the UK . Ukip's new MP Douglas Carswell faced a barrage of questions over Nigel Farage's remarks about HIV . Mr Carswell was born and grew up in Africa where both his parents worked as doctors. On a walkabout in Clacton today, Mr Carswell said: ‘I agree with everything that Nigel has said and we need an Australian type immigration system.’ HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust said the UKIP leader's remarks displayed a ‘new level of ignorance’. ‘The idea that having HIV should be used as a black mark against someone's name is ridiculous and shows an outrageous lack of understanding of the issue,’ the charity's chief executive Rosemary Gillespie said. She added: ‘In bracketing those living with the condition with murderers, and suggesting there is no place for them in his vision of Britain, Mr Farage has stooped to a new level of ignorance. He should be truly ashamed.’ But Mr Farage defended the remarks, originally published in the magazine Newsweek Europe. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK's public services could not cope with extra demand created by people with severe medical conditions coming to Britain. He said: ‘We want people to come who have got trades and skills, but we don't want people who have got criminal records - and we can't afford people with life-threatening diseases. ‘I do not think people with life-threatening diseases should be treated by our National Health Service and that is an absolute essential condition for working out a proper immigration policy. ‘We have leading cancer experts in Britain saying the burden now of treating overseas people is leading to huge shortages in the system.’ He added the UK should follow similar bans he said were in place in the United States and Australia. About 40 per cent of new HIV diagnoses in 2013 were of people born outside the UK, according to Public Health England. Tory defector and UKIP candidate for the parliamentary seat of Rochester and Strood, Mark Reckless, said he did not believe there should be a blanket ban on people with HIV entering the country. He added he believed the Mr Farage's comments, as reported by Newsweek Europe, were misleading. In the film 'The Last King of Scotland' actor Forest Whitaker plays the brutal Ugandan dictator Idi Amin . Set in Uganda the film features James McAvoy (left) as 'Dr Garrigan' - inspired by Mr Carswell's father Wilson Carswell who diagnosed the first confirmed cases of HIV/AIDS in Uganda . Dr Wilson Carswell - Douglas Carswell's father - was the inspiration behind the character of the Scottish doctor in the film 'The Last King of Scotland' A patient from overseas suffering from HIV is entitled to lifelong treatment on the NHS. Thanks to a change in policy, an HIV-positive migrant could go and see their GP complaining of something as innocuous as a cold – and end up costing the NHS hundreds of thousands of pounds. This is because in a bid to prevent the spread of the disease, the Coalition in 2012 decided to treat all foreigners with HIV, even if their cases were not emergencies. The NHS now offers expensive £20,000-a-year antiretroviral drugs to all non-British residents in England with the disease, including failed asylum seekers and students on temporary visas. The average lifetime treatment cost for an HIV-positive person runs to hundreds of thousands of pounds. And once here, if a migrant or asylum seeker has HIV or Aids, it is hard to remove them. This is because failed asylum seekers from countries with poor medical systems can claim that sending them back would condemn them to die and so fight removal on the grounds that it would be a breach of their human rights. It is not known how many patients are affected or how much the policy has cost the Health Service in total. But doctors have warned that the cost to the NHS of ‘health tourism’ could be billions of pounds. In his interview with Newsweek Europe Mr Farage is quoted as saying immigrants from outside Europe are ‘discriminated against because we have an open door into Europe today’. Mr Farage added: ‘If you're an Indian engineer, say, your chances of admission are limited. UKIP want to control the quantity and quality of people who come.’ The UKIP leader then went on to define what he meant by ‘quality’. ‘It's simple. That Latvian convicted murderer shouldn't have been allowed here. Yes and people who do not have HIV, to be frank. That's a good start. And people with a skill.’ ‘What are those words inscribed under the Statue of Liberty? 'Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses . . . ' What you're saying is: 'Bring me your electricians, your merchant bankers and your guys without HIV'.’ ‘There are 190 countries in the world,’ Mr Farage added, ‘that operate like that’. A caller to Mr Farage’s phone-in show on LBC called Charlie told Mr Farage that he was ‘ramping up the fear makes people hide’ and accuses him of ‘playing the race card’. She said she was not a ‘drain on the health service’ just because she has HIV. But Mr Farage said: ‘If we turn the national health service, and the clue is in the name, if we change it to the global health service, we are going to have a serious problem with resources.’ In the interview with Newsweek Europe, published today, Mr Farage said it was wrong that the ‘chances of admission’ of highly qualified engineers from India were limited. ‘Ukip want to control the quantity and quality of people who come,’ he said. Referring to convicted killer Arnis Zalkalns, who is suspected of murdering London schoolgirl Alice Gross, he added: ‘It’s simple. That Latvian convicted murderer shouldn’t have been allowed here.’ Asked whether ‘quality’ meant people without a homicide conviction, he answered: ‘Yes. And people who do not have HIV, to be frank. That’s a good start. And people with a skill. That is what Britain should do.’ He went on to say: ‘I have never said that we should not take refugees. We have a proud record of accepting refugees, and that must be continued.’ Nearly 20 Tories backed an unsuccessful amendment to the Government’s Immigration Bill earlier this year – which would have required anyone coming to settle in Britain to prove that they were not HIV positive or carrying Hepatitis B. In 2010, Barack Obama overturned a 20-year-old US travel and immigration ban against people with HIV. Currently around 60 countries bar the entry of HIV-positive people, according to the United Nations. The list includes the Bahamas, the Kingdom of Brunei, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Papua New Guinea, Qatar, Russia, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sudan, the UAE and Yemen.","Farage says Britain should not accept immigrants with HIV or tuberculosis .

"Apple's gold iPad is expected to launch at a 'small' event in Cupertino on 16 October - a week earlier than first thought . Despite claims Apple has been gearing up to launch its new range of iPads on 21 October, we may get to see the devices a week earlier. Tech site Re/code claims the launch event will now take place on 16 October at Apple's Cupertino headquarters. If these reports are true, the iPad could go on sale on the 24 October. Last week, rumours suggested Apple was putting the finishing touches to a new version of it's iPad Air - including a gold version. The small event is likely to be in stark contrast to the star-studded launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which saw U2 playing before the firm controversially gave away the band's new album. The move is thought to be designed to boost sales of its full-size tablets, which are in decline. Until now, iPads have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme, but a golden makeover would make the tablets more similar to the Californian company’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which come in three colours. New versions of the 9.7-inch tablet could include a golden metal rear cover as well as the silver and grey currently offered for the iPad Air, ‘people familiar with the matter’ told Bloomberg. The new iPads are also predicted to sport a thinner, more rounded design, similar to the iPhone 6. Hidden code in the latest iOS 8.1 beta software hints that the iPads will feature a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and Apple Pay functionality. The code states that users can 'pay with iPad using Touch ID. With Apple Pay, you no longer need to type card numbers and shipping information.' However, it is not clear whether the new iPad will come with NFC functionality, which is used for contactless payments, as it relies on a Wi-Fi or mobile connection. Apple Pay has only been announced in the US, so if the iPads do get the feature, it may be limited to only American buyers. Until now, iPads have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme, but a golden makeover would make the tablets - available in silver and space grey - more similar to the Californian company’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which come in three colours (pictured) Apple is preparing to launch a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales.

'A new line of iMacs with ultra high-resolution Retina Displays is in late testing stages within Apple, according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer,' said 9to5 Mac. 'While the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design, which was introduced in 2012, it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved Wi-Fi antennas,' it says. The firm will also launch a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite. The Yosemite software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their Mac - even if their iPhone is in another room. The software has also been overhauled with a new 'flat' look, and can search the web without having to open a browser. Apple is also rumoured to be launching a larger iPad with a 12.9-inch screen next year, which if true, could offer 76 per cent more screen area than the current 9.7 inch models. The latest swathe of Apple tablets could come with a split screen function, which would allow users of an iPad to open two apps side-by-side on one screen. Sales of iPads have slumped for two quarters, after climbing from $5 billion (£3 billion) when they were launched in 2010, to $30 billion (£19 billion)  in 2012 and $32 billion in 2013 (£20 billion). The firm hasn't unveiled an updated iPad since last October when it launched the iPad Air and Mini, and it appears that consumers have instead been drawn to smartphones with larger screens, including recently, Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus, which has a 5.5 inch screen. Apple is not new to the strategy of launching colourful products to boost its sales. In 1999 it rolled out different coloured iMacs which were successful, but sales of its iPhone 5C – a ‘budget’ version of the iPhone 5S – have not sold as well as the company hoped. The company is expected to unveil the new iPads at the same time as a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales.

"At the height of his 70s fame she was yet to arrive in the world. And her R'n'B songs are a world away from his glam rock tracks. Yet Beyonce appears to have sought inspiration from Slade's Dave Hill as she unveiled her kooky new fringe and straight locks. The star usually opts for long, glossy and with a wave but has switched for a style that resembles a helmet. Scroll down for video . Left, Beyonce showing off her new haircut as she caught the Eurostar from Paris to London on Tuesday, and right, 1970s Slade guitarist Dave Hill, pictured with his famous fringe in 1973 . Beyonce, pictured in 2007 sporting her standard - and safer - look . Hill, now 68, was known for his penchant for wearing jumpsuits that appeared to be made out of the foil used to baste turkeys but it was his distinctive hair that made headlines and once led a music journalist to describe it as a 'sort of demented tonsure with a great scooping fringe.' Beyonce was enjoying a holiday in Paris and revealed her dramatic change as she arrived at Gare du Nord station with rapper husband Jay Z, 44, and two-year-old daughter Blue Ivy to take the Eurostar to London's St Pancras station. It is not the first time Beyonce has courted attention for transforming her hair. In August last year she opted for a bleached, pixie crop that also set tongues wagging. Beyonce and Jay-Z spent yesterday in east London visiting a community arts project and sculpture galleries. Earlier this year it was reported the couple have bought themselves a sprawling £5.5million London townhouse. After looking both in Mayfair and out in the sticks – the Cotswolds – the pair are believed to have chosen a detached property in West London. A source is reported to have said: 'Both Jay and Beyonce are Anglophiles and have been toying with the idea of getting a pad for a couple of years now. Making it work! The defiant singer has taken to her Tumblr account to show off her new 'do . 'On previous trips, they have stayed in five star hotels and, on one occasion, a rented mansion. While money isn't an issue, it makes sense for them to have a more permanent base and get to know one particular area. 'They are coming to England this year and touring before the year is out.' As well as a host of trendy restaurants and Portobello market, their new home is near a number of top primary schools – should the couple want to make the move more permanent and school Blue Ivy in England.

"Former Chelsea defender Graeme Le Saux expects Jose Mourinho to target another Wembley final success in the Capital One Cup. The Premier League leaders play at Championship promotion hopefuls Derby on Tuesday night in the quarter-final stage of the knockout competition. The final silverware of Mourinho's trophy-laden first spell was an FA Cup success at Wembley in May 2007, but his two League Cup wins came in Cardiff, in 2005 and 2007. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho won the League Cup in 2005 and 2007 during his first spell at the club . The likes of Michael Ballack and Arjen Robben (both pictured) helped Chelsea win the League Cup in 2007 . Unlike some bosses, Mourinho placed importance on the League Cup during his first spell, with the momentum generated by success aiding his side in the closing months of the season. Le Saux, speaking on behalf of Capital One, credit card company and sponsor of the League Cup, said: 'It was the first trophy he won with Chelsea. 'I'm sure he enjoyed that experience so much and once you've tasted it you want to experience it again. 'It's something that I'm sure they're as focused on as all the other competitions they're in.' Le Saux won the competition with Chelsea in 1998. He added: 'Walking out at Wembley in front of 80,000 people with half the stadium blue and half the stadium red, because we played Middlesbrough, and then going on to win the cup goes down as one of my great memories. It's something that everybody has ambitions to play for.' Chelsea have stuttered of late, drawing at Sunderland and losing at Newcastle in the Premier League. Sunderland beat the Blues in the Capital One Cup last term, while Manchester City beat them in an FA Cup run which began at Derby in January. Mourinho will be hoping to guide his side to a Capital One Cup final at Wembley after winning the FA Cup at the prestigious venue in 2007 . Derby boss Steve McClaren will be hoping to upset the odds by knocking Chelsea out of the cup . The Rams are riding high in the second tier and can go into the game with confidence, according to Le Saux. 'For Derby there is the opportunity to prove to themselves that they're more than capable of competing against players of the calibre that Chelsea have,' the former England left-back added. 'The template that Sunderland and Newcastle used against Chelsea is a great opportunity for (Derby boss Steve) McClaren to look at that and use the same blueprint.' Le Saux is also intrigued by the Premier League after Chelsea's commanding advantage was cut to three points. He said: 'Credit to Man City for staying in there. Manuel Pellegrini wanted eight straight wins and they're on the way to achieving that. 'They've turned a corner. They were winning games, but their performance has changed: the level of performance, the energy, the ambition and determination is back. 'Rather than us looking at Christmas thinking Chelsea could extend their lead, any one of four teams could be back in the race come the new year.'

"In Barrow, Alaska, it all begins with a euphoric voice over a crackling radio: 'Hey, hey, hey!' The signal from an Inupiat whaling captain in a tiny boat on the grey waters of the Chukchi Sea is heard in nearly every home of this frozen town as far north as you can go in the United States, and its meaning is clearly understood. A bowhead whale - one of the oldest and largest mammals on earth - has been caught. The marine mammal, which can reach sixty feet in length and weigh more than 100 tons, required a Herculean effort to move. Work continued into the night to butcher it into manageable portions. WARNING: Graphic images . Fresh catch: In this October 7 photo, Fredrick Brower, center, helps cut up a bowhead whale caught by Inupiat subsistence hunters on a field near Barrow, Alaska . Keeping with a tradition that stretches back thousands of years, bowhead whales are hunted by boat during the fall season. Once ashore, residents flock to help in the work of divvying up the whale. As children slide down the whale's slippery side, officials inspect the catch and ensure the hunters have followed international guidelines to keep traditional whaling on a subsistence scale for native communities. The skin and blubber, known as muktuk, is prized by the Inupiat, and often eaten frozen. The community says the catch helps them feed their families in the town where produce such as watermelons that are flown in cost as much as $20 each at the local grocery. Animal encounter: Children play on to the whale's head before work begins to butcher it . Whale of a time: Whaling is a community event in Barrow, as family members and town residents race to the beach to congratulate the hunters and help to butcher the catch (above Molly Pederson, right, and daughter Laura Patkotak take a picture) Bloody: A cutter stands on top of the whale - the meat, baleen, bones and organs are used for food, art, household goods, and construction . From ship to shore: Once a whale is caught, it is pulled on land by the tiny boats, in an effort that often takes hours . Local celebrity: Qaiyaan Aiken, center, gets a hug from his wife as he is congratulated for harpooning the bowhead whale - the crews that bring in a whale are celebrated in town . Grub's up: The whale skin and blubber, known as muktuk, is prized by the Inupiat, and often eaten frozen . Team effort: Family members and friends of the Anagi whaling crew celebrate the capture of the sea creature . Way of life: Qaiyaan Aiken, second from left, walks his son along the giant mouth of the bowhead whale he harpooned - the skills for the hunt are learned first by watching, and then by doing, as the tradition is passed forward . Giving thanks: Crawford Patkotak, above center, leads a prayer flanked by his sons Josiah, in green suspenders, Arnold, in white bib, and Samuel, fourth from right . Giant: The whales, which can reach sixty feet in length and weigh more than 100 tons, can take a Herculean effort to move . Sliced: Blades lashed to poles are used to cut down through the blubber in sections, to be hooked and hauled off . Enough for all: A section of the skin and blubber is reserved for the captain of the boat, who hosts a feast for the community . Tradition: Children of Barrow too small to help with the hooking and cutting, are brought down to the whale to learn about the process . Air mail: Some sections of blubber are placed into duct-taped coolers and shipped by plane to elders living in warmer climates farther south . Keeping the energy up: As workers continue with the cutting and hooking of the whale blubber, others prepare a soup to warm the crews . Getting into the spirit: Most members of a whaling family pitch in once a whale is caught. Often, three generations of a whaling family are at the task of butchering and dividing the whale . Manual task: Young whalers learn about butchering on job - they start by using a hook to pull off the giant slabs of skin and blubber - later, they may move to the more skilled task of cutter . Momento: Whale bones are coveted by many in Barrow, often used to adorn the grave sites of loved ones . Clean up time: After a whale is divided and shared, blood and some remains are hauled off farther from town .","Photographs have surfaced of a bowhead whale being butchered  in Barrow, Alaska .

"When she moved to the countryside seven years ago, she adopted a menagerie of animals and threw herself into rural pursuits. But now that Billie Piper has returned to the city, it seems she has found a new hobby. The 32-year-old actress and her husband Laurence Fox have started attending hot yoga classes, which take place in temperatures of 40c. Scroll down for video . Actress Billie Piper, left, and husband Laurence Fox, right are both fans of the new Bikram yoga fad . The high intensity workout is also described as 'hot yoga' due to the sweltering temperature and high humidity . And the pair are breaking a sweat in star-studded company, with actress Helena Bonham Carter attending the same sessions. Miss Piper’s love of the ‘hot yoga’ workouts was revealed by Fox in an interview in which he lifted the lid on family life and marriage. The 36-year-old actor – best known for playing James Hathaway in long-running drama Lewis – told Woman magazine: ‘I’ve just started exercising – to stop my mind wandering, more than anything. ‘Me and the missus do a bit of 'Bikram' yoga twice a week. Helena Bonham Carter was there the other day. I said hello and then realised I didn’t know her.’ Madonna, Coleen Rooney, Andy Murray and Gwyneth Paltrow are also known to be fans of Bikram, which is based on the more common hatha yoga but performed in sweltering temperatures and 40 per cent humidity. Devotees claim that not only does it leave them stronger and more flexible, it also helps them shed weight fast. Just a few years ago, Miss Piper insisted her fitness regime involved nothing more than running around after sons Winston, now five, and Eugene, two. Shortly after Winston was born, she declared: ‘Exercise is the most boring thing in the world. It’s boring and hellish.’ Helena Bonham Carter, left, and Madonna, right, are both fans of the Bikram yoga workouts . In another interview, she said: ‘Having a child is the best way to keep trim as it completely changes your metabolism. I just don’t stop.’ Former Doctor Who star Miss Piper and her husband recently swapped their £825,000 cottage in a secluded West Sussex village for a four-bedroom home in North London which they bought for £1.7million last year. They moved to the countryside in 2007 and threw themselves into rural life, buying a horse called Chutney, two pigs named Boris and Barack, and three chickens. But with their careers flourishing in the capital, they decided to return. Miss Piper recently starred in Great Britain at London’s National Theatre and played an Irish immigrant in Sky Atlantic drama Penny Dreadful. Fox is busy recording an album and made his own West End appearance in Strangers on a Train at the Gielgud Theatre.","Bille Piper's husband Laurence Fox revealed the couple's hot yoga secret .

"Kolo Toure thinks speculation over Brendan Rodgers' future is 'crazy' and has backed the Liverpool manager to turn things around at Anfield. Liverpool slumped to 10th in the Barclays Premier League after their seventh and most damaging defeat of the season at the home of arch-rivals Manchester United on Sunday. Rodgers was hailed for taking Liverpool to within a whisker of the title last season, but he has come in for severe criticism of late. VIDEO Scroll down to see Brendan Rodgers on team spirit following defeat to United . Brendan Rodgers has come under severe criticism from certain quarters after Liverpool's latest loss . Raheem Stterling reacts after missing one of several clear chances for Liverpool against Manchester United . Kolo Toure (centre) has dismissed talk of Rodgers being sacked as 'crazy' Liverpool are 18 points shy of leaders Chelsea after Sunday's 3-0 defeat and they also exited the Champions League at the first hurdle after recording just one win - against Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets. Toure thinks the criticism of Rodgers has been harsh considering that he was just two points short of guiding Liverpool to their first title in 24 years last season. 'It's crazy to even talk about his future,' the Liverpool defender said. 'He's a great manager and we all know that. Just look at how fantastic he did last season.' Toure will forever be indebted to Rodgers for handing him an exit route from Manchester City, where he struggled to hold down a first-team place following a £16million move from Arsenal. Rodgers reacts angrily during the loss to United at Old Trafford on Sunday . Charged with leading the Liverpool front line, Sterling shows frustration after another missed opportunity . He retains complete faith in the Northern Irishman and says the rest of the squad support their manager too. 'We're all behind him and we're all trying to make things better,' Toure said. 'He's a great manager. We all love him. 'He took me from City where I was not playing a lot and people were thinking 'Kolo is gone' and he gave me another chance by bringing me in to Liverpool and now I am playing at one of the best clubs in the world. 'I enjoy my football under him. I feel more young than ever now. He is a great manager and he makes us play football. Rodgers is a 'great manager', according to Toure, and he deserves time to turn things around . 'We will all do our best to get him and the club out of this situation.' Rodgers spent £117million in the summer, but none of the nine recruits have impressed so far and the Reds have greatly missed the injured Daniel Sturridge. Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have scored once between them in 1,265 minutes of Premier League action this season. Adam Lallana has struggled to find form after injury and his former Southampton team-mate Dejan Lovren has done nothing to justify the £20million fee Liverpool paid for him in the summer. But given time, the players will start producing, Toure insists. 'My message to the fans is this - keep believing,' he said. Glen Johnson makes an early exit after just 26 minutes through injury and is replaced by Toure . 'I believe in this manager and I believe in this group of players. I know we will improve during the second half of the season. 'We have brought in new players, they need to adapt and that always takes time. 'It's been a tough week for us with going out of the Champions League to Basle and then losing to United. 'But this is a good club and we bounce back all the time. We have to stick together and make sure we bounce back again. If we win one game then the confidence will come back.' Sterling pays for his hesitation as David de Gea makes another remarkable save . Liverpool face Arsenal next weekend and then have a run of winnable fixtures over the festive period against Burnley, Swansea, Leicester, Sunderland and Aston Villa. But first they face the tricky task of defeating in-form Bournemouth in their Capital One Cup quarter-final clash on Wednesday. Eddie Howe's team are unbeaten in 12 games, but Toure is looking forward to playing against the Sky Bet Championship team. 'The League Cup is a really important competition for us,' said Toure, who captained Arsenal to defeat in the 2007 final against Chelsea. 'There's the chance to get to Wembley and win a trophy. We have the quality to do that.' Sterling watches as the ball ricochets off De Gea's foot and away from the goal .","Liverpool lost 3-0 against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday .

"A Muslim student was left in disbelief after buying a packet of Asda cheese and onion rolls to find it contained a pork sausage roll. Rabia Qureshi, 20, bought the £2 pack of 10 ‘Chosen By You’ branded rolls from the superstore in Bradford, West Yorkshire. She quickly spotted the single meat-filled pastry after putting it in the microwave to cook it and realised the filling was the wrong colour. The packet of cheese and onion sausage rolls that Rabia Qureshi bought from the Asda store in Bradford . Ms Qureshi, who is studying optometry at the University of Bradford, said: ‘This is not acceptable. I don’t eat sausage rolls and what about vegetarians too? It was really shocking.’ ‘I warmed it up in the microwave and I knew that something was wrong. Meat has that texture and I knew it was meat when I looked at it. ‘I got the knife and fork and started to investigate. I disinfected the plate after it and I don’t know what I would have done if I had eaten it.’ She added that her mother was upset because she worried she would have eaten it. Staff from the supermarket have apologised and are carrying out a detailed investigation after they were unable to understand how it happened. Asda said only cheese and onion rolls had been processed on that particular production run, and the one previous to that – and there had been no other complaints. Ms Qureshi continued: ‘I always buy vegetarian food in the supermarket because it is better to be safe. ‘But my mum is scared to buy anything vegetarian from the supermarket now.’ Her mother, Humma Qureshi, 49, said: ‘Vegetarian labelled packaging should contain vegetarian food. I’m concerned that other people could have eaten one by mistake. The Muslim student spotted the sausage roll (above) amongst the other pastries in the packet before she ate it . ‘Some people just nibble at their food and they wouldn’t know that is was meat until it was too late. ‘If it wasn’t meat it could have been a nut and that could have been dangerous for someone with an allergy. People need to know what is going in their food and need to be able to trust it.’ The student has now launched an online campaign against Asda warning people who trust vegetarian labelling to double check their food before they eat it. She said: ‘What upset me the most is that it takes 40 days to process the complaint and that is not even investigating it. ‘Asda didn’t give me a complaint reference number and they haven’t made any effort with me. I’ve not heard anything back since I made the complaint on Thursday morning.’ The packet was sold to Ms Qureshi at the Lidget Green store in Bradford, West Yorkshire (above) last week . Ms Qureshi claims staff were not willing to remove the batch from the shelf. She continued: ‘They weren’t budging when I complained and all they cared about was taking the sausage roll off me. It’s in my freezer now. Head office tried to offer me a refund but I want the food to be checked properly. There’s something wrong with the production line. ‘I wouldn’t shop at Asda again and I have told them that. I’m definitely taking legal action and going forward with this. Quality control should have checked it.’ A spokesman for Asda said: ‘We’re at a loss to understand how this happened and are confident this is an isolated incident. ‘We’re sorry for any upset caused to Ms Qureshi, and we’ll be in touch with her shortly with the details of our full investigation.’","Rabia Qureshi, 20, bought pack of 10 of branded rolls from Bradford store .

"This is the dramatic moment a self-styled 'paedophile hunter' confronted a potential sex attacker who he had lured to a house by posing as a child online. Vigilante Stinson Hunter, who is based in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, works with his team to entrap internet perverts - including soldiers, teachers and solicitors - by posing as underage boys and girls. In this dramatic clip,  undercover vigilantes from Hunter's team were seen poised for action with a camera while they waited for one of the suspects. When the man walked in, one of the vigilantes asked the suspect to explain himself, before starting to click away with his camera in a bid to expose him. Scroll down for video . In action: A clip from the documentary 'Paedophile Hunter' shows Stinson Hunter and his team confronting a suspected paedophile after they lured him to a house so they could ask him about his alleged crime . Hunting down: In the dramatic footage, one man stood poised with his camera and waited for the man to enter in a bid to expose him . But the man - who was not seen on camera - fled from the scene, sparking a sudden chase which was captured on a shaky, hand-held camera. The two men shouted for him to stop, promising him the information would be handed to the police. One of the men was then heard saying: 'Sir, I suggest you stop and talk, your information is going to be handed to the police'. The clip sets the tone for the remainder of the Paedophile Hunter, a one-hour film to be shown tomorrow night on Channel 4. It follows the 31-year-old and his team as they track down suspects through the internet and dating apps. Hunter told the documentary each of the team has a 'defined role'. Grime, who features heavily in the documentary, is the 'tech guy', responsible for ensuring the videos are filmed and edited properly. But the man - who was not seen on camera - ran from the property when he realised he could be exposed . The men were heard shouting: 'Sir, I suggest you stop and talk, your information is going to be handed to the police,' while they chased him with a shaky, hand-held video . The vigilantes usually pose as boys or girls in their early teens. Once they are sent explicit messages and videos by the men, the team lure them to a house to meet up. There, they are filmed with handheld cameras and mobile phones and told to explain themselves. The messages and footage are handed to police. So far, Hunter has filmed confrontations with dozens of men including soldiers, teachers and solicitors and seen his evidence help in 10 convictions. During the documentary, the team was also filmed setting up a trap to catch the suspected offender. One of the team was filmed following a black taxi, while speaking on the phone to two of his colleagues. Meanwhile, those two vigilantes were filmed nervously peering through the blinds while they waited for the arrival of a taxi at a nearby home. Footage from the documentary shows members of the team poised for action before one of their stings . While one of the team followed the suspect who is travelling to the house in a taxi, others waited inside, nervously peering through the blinds until he arrives . They are filmed waiting in a house where they stand with handheld cameras and mobile phones, reading to confront the alleged paedophile . When one shouted 'Taxi's here', the pair - one equipped with a camera - put themselves into position and waited to confront the man when he arrived at the front door. Hunter's methods have been both praised and criticised. Stinson's methods came under fire last year after one man who he confronted, 45-year-old Michael Parkes, took his own life. Jim Gamble (pictured) said online vigilantes were 'shooting fish in a barrel' by using covert stings . But Jim Gamble, the former head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), said the former drug addict provided a lesson in how people could trap paedophiles with 'very little training'. He said: 'Some people with very little training are proving just how easy it is to go out there and catch individuals. 'They are able to go online with little or no training and very quickly they’re shooting fish in a barrel. 'The fact of the matter is this, that needs to be done by law enforcement and whilst I don’t see any justification in reality for vigilantes doing what they do I think it provides the evidence for the Government, if it’s needed, that actually this works.' He added he understood the 'frustration' that drove the self-styled investigative journalist, who lives in the Coventry area and says he witnessed abuse as a child, to target suspected predators. But Mr Gamble insisted the vigilante's actions created 'a risk' to himself and other people, and were not the most appropriate way forward. But there have been controversies, particularly in the case of Mr Parkes. The 45-year-old hanged himself last year after being questioned by police after he was confronted by Stinson Hunter, and footage of the encounter was uploaded to the internet. Northamptonshire Police later said they would have sought to charge Mr Parkes in connection with the incident, in which he arranged to meet someone he thought was a 12-year-old girl. Mr Parkes’ partner, who was also interviewed for the Channel 4 documentary, said she 'may agree' with the vigilante going online to gather evidence, but said publishing the videos was 'what probably tipped him over the edge'. Stinson Hunter had insisted on keeping his face secret for fear of reprisals, but went public after saying he had 'always wanted to be on Channel 4'. Stinson Hunter, pictured, tells the documentary that he carries out his work with the help of his team who all have 'dedicated roles' Effect: Michael Parkes, pictured, hanged himself after he was confronted by Stinson Hunter last year . Controversial: Self-styled paedophile catchers like Stinson Hunter (pictured) show police should invest more in online stings, according to Britain's former child protection chief Jim Gamble . Website: Until now the 31-year-old former drug addict had hidden his face on his website (pictured) He told the film's Bafta-winning director Dan Reed: 'We set the profile. It’s like a rope and if they choose to put the rope around their neck and hang themselves that’s their choice. 'We’ve not pushed them.' The film also features interviews with police and legal experts who tackle child exploitation, who talk about the dangers for vigilantes, the people they target and their families. There is also the risk that amateur investigations could compromise police probes, the experts say. One barrister who regularly deals with child exploitation cases, Hugh Davies QC, added there were risks of copycat vigilantes springing up in response. The Paedophile Hunter will be screened on Wednesday, October 1 at 10pm on Channel 4.","C4 film to air tomorrow focuses on self-styled web vigilante Stinson Hunter .

"In just over a month, Rosetta engineers will hope to make space history by landing a small robot on the surface of an icy comet for the first time. The craft has now beamed back a number of measurements to help make that landing a success - and they're so accurate, they can be used by anyone to 3D print their own duck-shaped comet. Mission scientists had previously only been able to say that the comet was about 2.4 miles (4km) wide, but the latest data provides a more definite shape for 67P. Rosetta has beamed back a number of measurements to help make that the landing a success – and they can also be used by anyone to 3D print their own duck-shaped comet. Pictured is the latest shape model of 67P/C-G . And now scientists have revealed that the head, or smaller lobe of the comet, is 1.5 miles by 1.5 miles by 1.2km (2.5km by 2.5km by 2km). The ‘body’ has been measured as being 2.5 miles (4.1km) by 1.9 miles (3.2km) by 0.8miles (1.3km) and the rate it rotates is now known to be once every 12.4043 hours. The images are available as .wrl and .obj files from Esa’s website, which means anyone with the appropriate software and a 3D printer will be able to create a physical model of the comet. As Rosetta edges closer to the comet, it is sending back increasingly clearer images of its target. It plans to send the Philae lander on the comet's surface on November 12. Scientists have revealed that the head, or smaller lobe of the comet, is 1.5 miles by 1.5 miles (2.5km by 2.5km by 2km). The 'body' has been measured as being 2.5 miles (4.1km) by 1.9 miles (3.2km) by 0.8miles (1.3km) Last week, Rosetta engineers spotted mysterious jets of water vapour spurting from the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It’s known that as the comet approaches the sun its surface will melt, expelling vapour into space, but why the vapour is appearing as jets from only certain points on the surface is unclear. In a blog post, Esa Space Science Editor Dr Emily Baldwin explained that the four images are a montage taken on 26 September from a distance of 16.3 miles (26.3km) from the comet’s centre. 'What we’re seeing is the product of ices sublimating and gases escaping from inside the comet, carrying streams of dust out into space,’ she wrote. ‘Zooming in close to the surface and to the source of this activity, and it is apparent that it is originating from several discrete locations.’ In the image, the jets can be seen travelling into space from the comet. This amazing new image reveals more jets of water vapour on Comet 67P (shown). The latest mosaic of the jets was created by stitching together images from Rosetta. Emily Lakdawalla of The Planetary Society first spotted the jets last month but their origin and formation remains a mystery . The Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km) to Comet 67P. The 220lb (100kg) lander will reach the surface on 12 November. It will take around seven hours to descend. During the descent, images will be taken and other observations of the comet's environment will be made. Philae . will make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace, using screws . and harpoons to lower and secure itself on the surface. Once . the lander touches down, it will make a 360° panoramic image of the . landing site to help determine where and in what orientation it has . landed. The . initial science phase will then begin, with other instruments analysing . the plasma and magnetic environment, and the surface and subsurface . temperature. The lander will also drill and collect samples from beneath the surface, delivering them to the onboard laboratory for analysis. The interior structure of the comet will be explored by sending radio waves through the surface towards Rosetta. They are centered on one location, the middle of the comet, with no other part of the comet seeming to have such jets. This may suggest that, as the comet has orbited the sun many times before, much of its ice may have already melted. This would mean that only small pockets of ice melt and produce vapour in this way as it approaches - which could explain the formation of specific jets. As the comet approaches the sun it will become more active, and scientists will be hoping for more opportunities to view features like these. Dr Baldwin continued: ‘As the comet gets progressively closer to the sun along its orbit, the surface will become warmer, and the level of activity will increase, producing a vast coma around the nucleus, along with a tail. ‘It’s perhaps hard to believe looking at images like this at less than 30km [18.6 miles] distance from the surface, but recent gound-based images have revealed that 67P/C-G’s coma already extends at least 19,000km [11,800 miles] from the nucleus!’ In other Rosetta news, digital imaging professor Mattias Malmer created a 3D model of the comet’s surface, reports Dr Emily Lakdawalla from The Planetary Society. His montage, using data from Rosetta’s Navcam, shows the comet as seen on 24 September 2014. He explained that the views were made by projecting images of the comet over a digital model. This 3D model of the comet's surface was created by digital imaging professor Mattias Malmer. Using data from Rosetta's Navcam, it shows the comet as seen on 24 September . As soon as Rosetta entered orbit around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August, engineers rushed to find a landing site for its Philae lander - which they have now done. This is because, as the comet nears the sun, it will become more active, with more potentially hazardous vapour and debris released. And that activity was first revealed in images last month showing how the comet is indeed giving off water vapour as jets. As the comet (seen in this 'selfie' with Rosetta) approaches the sun it will become more active. Ice remaining on the surface will melt, surrounding the comet in gas. For this reason, engineers want to perform the planned landing of the Philae lander on the comet as soon as possible before too much vapour is present . In November the Rosetta probe will launch its Philae robot from a distance of about 6.2 miles (10km) to 67P. If all goes to plan, Philae will then make a gentle landing on the comet at walking pace. The lander will drill and collect samples from beneath the surface, delivering them to an onboard laboratory for analysis . Earlier this week scientists picked landing site 'J', shown, as the location where the Philae lander will touch down. Site J offers the minimum risk to the lander in comparison to the other candidate sites, and is also scientifically interesting, with signs of activity nearby .

"You might see a piece of scrap paper when you look at that out-of-date tax disc stuck behind your current one… but Jude Currie sees something precious. The 12-year-old has amassed a 12,000-strong collection of vehicle excise licence discs which is currently valued at £10,000. No surprise then that the schoolboy is incensed at the Government’s decision to axe the perforated bits of paper from October 1. Scroll down for video . Jude Currie, 12, has collected 12,000 car tax discs over the last five years, with discs dating back to 1926 . While the move may help the value of his collection rise, he is ‘gutted’ at the end of a 93-year tradition. Jude, from Cobham, Surrey has been collecting discs since he was seven, after spotting a colourful one on the windscreen of an abandoned Fiat. Now he has thousands, dating from 1926 to the present day. His first discs came from cars in scrap yards after he begged his parents Garnet and Candice to take him there. Over 1.7billion tax discs have been issued since their creation in 1921 – if they were put in a line, they would go around the world three times. Last year, the DVLA issued 42.2million tax discs weighing over 72 tonnes – that’s heavier than a Challenger 2 tank. ‘I’m always excited when I find old tax discs I don’t have,’ he said. The collecting of tax discs – known as velology – can be lucrative. Anything pre-1940s can make up to £100 on eBay and even discs from the 60s and 70s can command a tenner. Jude said: ‘I keep my collection in date order in folders. Some of my favourites are from the 1960s, 70s and 80s, as they have nice colours and are well laid out. ‘Just because the tax discs are being stopped doesn’t mean I’m going to stop collecting. There are still so many more I want to collect.’ As well as his impressive disc collection, Jude has also collected 600 car hubcaps. Mr Currie, 58, said: ‘Jude loves all paraphernalia relating to the motor trade – he is very knowledgeable. ‘He will even call out if there is a discarded hubcap on the road and I’ll have to pull over and pick it up so he can add it to his collection.’ Tax discs will be axed from October 1 - this Wednesday - angering Jude, despite the expected increased in value of his extensive collection . Jude's oldest car tax disc, which expired on September 30, 1926, could be worth more than £100 .","Jude Currie, 12, has collected the tax discs for around five years .

"A real-life superhero has turned down six-figure offers for his home-made Batmobile - so he can continue helping sick children. Batman fanatic Zac Mihajlovic, from Camden, south west of Sydney, has hand-built his very own street legal version of the famous batman car from the 1989 film starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. The very inventive 29-year-old turned his comic book fantasies into a high-octane reality by constructing a replica of the iconic vehicle. SCROLL DOWN TO VIDEO .

The 29 year old from south west of Sydney dresses up as Batman (pictured) and helps make the dreams of sick kids come true for the Make-A-Wish foundation . The Batman fanatic has turned down sic figures offers for his home made Batmobile (pictured) And there's no doubt the bat car has received a bit of attention, wherever it goes inciting plenty of reaction from surprised onlookers. 'The first time I took it out was definitely an experience,' said Zac. 'I can take it down and get groceries if I wanted to, the reaction of the car has just been insane.' 'I was on a freeway on the way to the Gold Coast and there was this noise, I thought something was wrong with the car, but it was actually the news helicopter from Channel nine chasing me down the freeway. That was pretty memorable.' Four years ago was when Zac decided to start building the incredible replica with the help of his very own Lucius Fox, grandfather John Greene, a retired engineer along with his friend, Scott Cox. Parts for a machine like this don't come easy but in the two years it took the team to create the beast, they were lucky enough to be able to get some parts from the car used in the original film. Zac (pictured left) had a little help building the iconic car thanks to grandfather John Greene (pictured right) who is a retired engineer. A friend, Scott Cox, also helped out on the car . There are thought to be ten other replicas of the 1989 Batmobile but Zac believes he has the only one that can be legally driven on public roads . Over the last three years Zac 9pictured as Batman) has helped more than 40 children meet The Caped Crusader through the Make-A-Wish foundation . 'It's got adjustable suspension, it's got a working afterburner, which is from the film - no machine gun sadly, no grappling hooks, no bombs that come out of the wheel, but beyond that, it's pretty close,' said Zac. There are thought to be ten other replicas of the 1989 Batmobile but Zac believes he has the only one that can be legally driven on public roads. And with any hot car comes the female attention with the Batmobile attracting its fair share of attention from the ladies. But for Zac he's not too bothered, who already has his very own bat girl, girlfriend Annabella Leone. 'We've been dating for about four years - and can I just say I was with him two years prior to the Batmobile,' joked Annabella. 'I have the passenger seat and if any girl out there wants it, I swear to god, she's dead.' The best thing it's road worthy with adjustable suspension and a working afterburner . Zac started building the Batmobile (pictured) four years ago . The Batmobile (pictured) gets quite a reaction anywhere it goes . Businessmen from across the world, including a Sheik in Dubai, have offered Zac big bucks for the Batmobile - and he has also seen his share of bizarre requests. 'I've had a couple ring me up and say 'I know this is gonna sound weird but we want to 'christen' the car', so to speak,' Zac said. 'I sort of said 'I'm not interested' and they said 'we'll pay you what you want – and we'll bring plastic sheets' and I'm like 'you've just made that worse, so no thanks'.' And rather than cash-in on his dream machine, the Batman fanatic decided to use his powers for good by teaming up with the Make-A-Wish foundation, who make dream's come true for terminally-ill children. 'It's a brilliant, brilliant charity because it gives kids, sadly, their dying wish.' Zac (pictured) says he isn't interested in selling his home made Batmobile (pictured) because he wants to continue helping sick kids . The Batmobile (pictured) is a version of the famous car from the 1989 film starring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson took two years to build . Thanks to grandfather John Greene (pictured right) Zac (pictured left) was able to build the iconic car which is actually street legal . 'I dress up as Batman and I surprise the kids - sometimes it's knocking on someone's door and surprising them, or sometimes it's taking them out to dinner.' 'Some of them run for their lives and it takes a bit of warming up to get them back, but some are just super pumped,' he said. Over the last three years Zac has helped more than 40 children meet The Caped Crusader and he has no plans to give up moonlighting as the masked superhero any time soon. And while he may not be using his amazing ride to battle the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, or even take cat woman for a ride - in the eyes of many he's still very much a hero.

"A city branded the Shark Attack Capital of The World has seen yet another two attacks – both on the same day. A 15-year-old boy and a 29-year-old man were bitten in two separate incidents in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, on Sunday. The two attacks this weekend takes this year’s shark bite toll to ten, Volusia County Beach officials said Monday. Victim: A 15-year-old boy who was bitten by a shark while surfing in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, on Sunday. Attack: The two victims were bitten by black tip sharks in two separate incidents on Sunday (stock image) The 15-year-old, from Maitland, Florida was bitten in the foot around 11am Sunday morning as he was surfing 100 yards off the shore. About 30 minutes later, Kevin Ross, 29, was bitten about a mile down the coast form the first incident. Ross, of Deltona, was able to identify the shark as a black-tip shark, estimating that it was around 4ft long. ‘I never, ever, thought I'd be attacked by a shark,’ Ross told MyFoxOrlando. ‘When it grabbed me, I was like “Oh my God, I'm going to die! This shark is about to eat me in the water!”’ Pain: The 15-year-old's injured food shows deep lacerations where the shark took hold . Hang loose: The brave teenage surfer pictured in hospital after the shark bite incident . Shark capital: New Smyrna Beach has more shark attacks per square mile than any other beach in the world . Fortunately Ross was able to make it back to shore and was taken to hospital by Volusia County Beach Patrol where he was given 30 stitches to his left foot. Ross, of Deltona, was able to identify the shark as a black-tip shark, estimating that it was around 4ft long. ‘We do have a lot of bites in the area,’ Capt. Aaron Jenkins of Volusia County Beach Safety told ABC News. ‘It's because there are a lot of smaller sharks here.’ Jenkins added that although does not believe the same shark was responsible for both attacks, it could be the same species attracted by an increase in bait fish in the stretch of the beach popular among surfers. New Smyrna Beach, a city of just over 22,900 people, has more incidents involving sharks and humans per square mile than any other beach in the world. As a result, it has been named the Shark Attack Capital of the World by International Shark Attack File (ISAF). In fact, it is estimated that a swimmer on New Smyrna Beach is within 10ft of a shark at any one time .","A boy, 15, and a man, 29, bitten by sharks in New Smyrna Beach, Florida .

"Some travellers prefer to make an effort integrating with the local culture when visiting a foreign country. Others will just be themselves and look after number one. But for those who are keen to 'fit in' abroad, it's important to do some research first. These infographics are a handy reminder of what not to do when on holiday, and will help travellers not to upset the locals. Scroll down for video . For example, in Mexico, taking an expensive gift to someone's home is a no-no - as it can be seen as a bribe. Flowers, chocolates or other such subtle gifts are accepted. But no marigolds in Mexico - they are associated with death and witchcraft. You have to be careful with your gift of flowers in Germany too - steer clear of carnations as they are associated with funerals. It's always best in this situation to ask the host what their favourite flowers are in advance. No-one likes an angry chef, so when visiting France, you better not be caught cutting your lettuce with a knife and fork as it is seen as an insult to the preparation of the salad. And it's best to tone down your friendly nature when you visit Italy - the locals are more reserved and extended conversation with a stranger can be seen as threatening. It may have been used in the 1960s and 1970s, but flashing the 'peace sign' in the UK isn't the best idea - depending at what angle it is viewed, it turns into something rather offensive. The lesson here is basically, when in doubt, don't do it. That's not to say when visiting foreign countries you have to keep yourself to yourself, but that it's always good to self-educate first. Oonagh Shiel, spokesman for Cheapflights.com, which compiled the infographic, said: 'Part of the fun of travelling is going outside your comfort zone and seeing the differences between cultures – but it’s important to be aware of your surroundings to avoid offending your hosts. 'Who’d have thought giving a gift in Mexico could be misconstrued, that carnations might go down badly in Germany – or that folding your lettuce in France could save your blushes? 'It seems that when you’re travelling, ""food can be rude"" – but with some simple tips it’s easy to ensure things go smoothly; after all, ""when in Rome""....'","If you're going to make an effort, it's worth doing your research .

"What normally would have left road kill is nothing short of a miracle. A coyote who was hit by an SUV got stuck in the cars bumper and survived. Mark Armour was on his way to work at the Waukegan, Illinois train station when he felt his car hit something but didn't see anything. When he got to the train station parking lot, dozens of people were starting at the front of his car and couldn't believe how a coyote managed to get stuck in his bumper. Coy-ootie: This adorable coyote miraculously survived being hit by an SUV and getting caught in the bumper . Grindtv.com reports that Armour's co-workers originally thought that the coyote was a fox. Armour called police and an animal control officer came to the scene and was amazed at what she saw. 'He said he thought he hit something, he could feel it, but he didn’t see anything,' said animal control officer Amber Manley to the Lake County News-Sun. Manley identified the animal as a coyote and couldn't believe the coyote had survived the impact of a speeding car. 'It was even more amazing he survived,' she said. Manly freed the struggling animal from the bumper and discovered that the animal was calm but in complete shock. 'He seemed docile,' she said. Manley put the animal in a crate and then loaded it onto the animal control vehicle. She contacted the director of animal control in Waukegan, Susan Elliot, to gain permission to take the coyote to Flint Creek Wildlife Rehabilitation. After receiving top of the line medical care, Dawn Keller, the founder of the medical center discovered that the coyote had three fractures in its legs. Keller gave the coyote antibiotics to prevent infection and also set the fractures. A day after the crash the coyote was eating again and 'resting comfortably.' They hope to release the coyote back into the wild in the winter. 'I think it was just an amazing call,' Manley said. Armour took top his Facebook page to give the coyote the name Vern. 'I am so glad Vern will recover. Thank you so much for taking care of him.' Armour has offered to donate money towards Vern's recovery.

"Peter Salmon, senior BBC executive and a former head of sport, has emerged as a contender to become the new general secretary of the FA. Salmon, who organised the BBC move to Manchester, worked very closely at the Corporation alongside FA chairman Greg Dyke when the latter was director general. And Salmon, who is married to the actress Sarah Lancashire, was able to win back a number of important football rights for the BBC, including the FA Cup, England internationals and Match of the Day Premier League highlights because of a large increase in the sports budget agreed by Dyke. BBC executive Peter Salmon (right, with wife Sarah Lancashire) could become the FA's new general secretary and reunite with Auntie's former director general and FA chairman Greg Dyke (left) Also Salmon’s potential candidature could explain why Dyke remains in favour of not employing headhunters for the search, preferring the FA board to save money by choosing from their pool of contacts. Another early name in the frame to replace the departing Alex Horne is Stewart Regan, who has impressed Dyke and others at Wembley with the way he has re-organised the Scottish FA as chief executive since leaving Yorkshire cricket. The FA remain remarkably confident that a sponsor for the FA Cup will finally be found before the third round — and one prepared to match the £9m a year paid by previous backers Budweiser. It is understood that another beer company are still in talks but the clock is ticking with the third-round draw on December 8. Wayne Rooney's agent Paul Stretford is one of the concerned middle men who has had discussions with the FA about Terry Byrne - who heads the 1966 agency who represent the England players - also looking after Jack Wilshere through Byrne’s new sports management agency, 10Ten Talent. Byrne received the go-ahead from the FA to sign England regular Wilshere but the conflict of interests has upset some FA sponsors and other agents looking after England footballers. Jack Wilshere's agent Terry Byrne also represents England players, sparking worries of a conflict of interest . England women’s match against Germany at Wembley on Sunday will draw a capped crowd of 55,000. Remarkable as that record attendance is, the match could have attracted as many as 75,000, such was the ongoing demand for tickets had Underground engineering works not led to the restrictions. And more viewers will tune in to the BBC’s live coverage of the women’s international than will watch either of the two Premier League matches on Sky. England's women will face Germany in front of a crowd of 55,000 at Wembley but it could have been 75,000 . TIME TO BAN THE BAND? England Fans FC manager Garford Beck has complained to the FA about the England supporters’ band encouraging offensive chanting during the Scotland match. Beck, who was in the England section at Celtic Park, intends to make an official complaint to Strathclyde Police if the FA don’t take action against the band, whose drumbeat to the repetitive singing of ‘F*** the IRA’ happened regularly during the first half until an FA official told them to stop. Beck claims the band’s actions were a lot worse than him and three colleagues wearing T-shirts during Euro 2012 calling for the release from prison of former Ukrainian leader Yulia Tymoshenko - for which they received official warnings from the FA. England Fans FC manager Garford Beck will make a complaint to police over the supporter's band backing anti-IRA singing at Wembley if the FA don't take action . Meanwhile, Pukka Pies will be relieved their eight-year sponsorship of the band finished before the World Cup, sparing them any further association with a discredited outfit. It is considered unlikely the band will find fresh backers to fund their England trips, although band leader John Hemmingham and the FA have apologised. ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley had to re-record his commentary of England’s first goal against Scotland after wrongly identifying the scorer as Wayne Rooney rather than Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. However, from where Tyldesley was sitting in the woefully antiquated Celtic Park press box, the scorer’s body shape did look remarkably like Rooney, who was also credited with the goal initially by the England Twitter feed and Stan Collymore on talkSPORT.

"A Sydney pool cleaner has become the first man in NSW to be found guilty of 'sexting' after a judge jailed him for at least three years on Thursday. Peter Lewis Sheather, 42, appeared in The Downing Centre Local Court where he admitted to using a mobile phone to harrass women by sending them lewd text messages, photographs and videos on his iPhone 5 between December 2013 and April this year. The court heard that the resident of Cammeray, north Sydney, was a 'depraved' man who sent sexually explicit material to nine women telling them of his desire to 'f****' them by the pools that he cleaned. Sexting offender: Peter Lewis Sheather, pictured leaving the Downing Centre court in June . Explicit messages: Pool cleaner Peter Sheather, 41, (pictured) pleaded guilty in the Downing Centre Court in Sydney in June and was jailed on Thursday for three years . He had been charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend after police seized laptops and documents from his home in late April. In sentencing the 42-year-old on Thursday magistrate Roger Prowse said Sheather was a 'depraved' man. 'If you had to look up the word depraved, you would find an entry: Peter Sheather,' he said. He said Sheather deserved nothing less than a jail sentence for harrasing his nine victims  - customers of two pool maintenance firms, Pool Doctor Services of Roseville on Sydney's upper north shore and Swim Art in Rose Bay, in the eastern suburbs. Sheather referred to several of his victims by name in a message saying, 'I'd love to f*** you in your pool', the court heard. Pool owner victims: Convicted 'sexter' Peter Sheather targeted women customers of Swim Art in Rose Bay and Pool Doctor Services in Roseville in March and April this year with suggestive text messages and explicit photos and videos of naked men involved in sex acts . When a victim warned Sheather she would show a sexually explicit video of a lewd act to police, he replied, 'You don't even know who it is.' The court heard Sheather had recently sought treatment for depression and had had a disadvantaged childhood marred by sexual abuse. Mr Prowse denied a defence application to have the sentencing adjourned pending a psychological evaluation. 'Depression does not equal depravity,'Mr Prowse said. 'Just imagine the outrage of the victims if he wasn't jailed.' Mr Prowse said Sheather had a 'hideous' record of offending and little prospect of rehabilitation. Sheather worked for both companies as a pool cleaner and used the women clients' mobile numbers plus intimate details about them and their backyard pools in text messages on a secret iPhone account he had obtained under a false name. Most of the calls originated in the upmarket Sydney suburbs of Bellevue Hill and Paddington. Police facts tendered at a court hearing in June court stated Sheather's sexting campaign which caused 'fear and offence' against the eight women pool owners began on March 4 this year when he sent a text to a woman named Sheila at at 12.29pm saying, 'Hey u. Did you get my photo this morning'. A second text to Sheila on March 14 at 7.12pm said in part, 'I'd love to f*** you in your pool ... Sheila'. Sheather  harassed women pool owners in Sydney's eastern suburbs and upper north shore with lurid messages and images . Police say the text frightened and offended the victim due to its 'overtly sexual nature' and the fact it shows the accused knows the victim's name and the fact the victim has a pool which cannot be seen from the street'. Sheather's next victim was a woman named Brittany who on March 7 at 7.03am he texted a message with 'a picture of a male standing naked with a semi-erect penis'. The head and face of the man could not be seen in the photo. The accompanying message read, 'Shower time. Wanna join me honey?' Peter Sheather: Hey sexy Liz. How's u? Liz: Fine. How r u and who r u . PS: it's simon. Didn't you save my number? Liz: Simon who . PS: Have u seriously forgotten . Liz: I know a lot of people called Simon . PS: Well we haven't been intimate lol. That narrow it down? Liz: Not really . PS: Would a pic help?? Liz: Yep as long as it ain't intimate . PS: Meaning not of my c*** . Liz: Yeah you'd probably need a zoom lens anyway . PS: Like you big t*** . Liz: F*** off . PS: Don't be like that Liz Let me [words removed here by Mailonline] and f*** u in your pool . At 1.05pm on the same day he texted the same photograph and message to his third victim. About a week later, at 11.56am on March 14, he texted her again saying, 'Hey sexy Kristina. How's your week honey?' On the evening of that day he sent a message to victim four, Nicole, saying in part, 'I'd love to f*** u in your pool ... Nicole'. On the same morning a woman called Margaret became victim number five when he texted her at 10.32am saying in part, 'I'd love to f*** u in your pool ... Maggie'. On the morning of March 19, a woman called Elizabeth became unwittingly involved in a text 'conversation' with Sheather after he sent her a message saying, 'Hey sexy Liz. How's u?'. Not knowing who sent the message, she replied, 'Fine. How r u and who r u?' The texts went back and forth for almost three hours until Sheather suggested he sent a photograph, mentioned his 'c***' and mentioned her 'big t***' and suggested she let him 'f*** u in your pool'. That evening Sheather texted his seventh victim, a woman named Nicole, saying, 'Hey sexy Gal. How's your week been? Did you work today or lazed at home.' Peter Lewis Sheather (above) pleaded guilty to nine charges in June of using a carriage service to menace, harass or offend . Shower time: Peter Lewis Sheather's lewd text messages to eight women customers of two Sydney pool maintenance businesses including Pool Doctor (above). Nicole did not answer because she believed the message was spam, however just over seven hours later, at 1.47am on March 20, Sheather sent her a 15 second long video which police say 'depicted an erect penis being masturbated and ejaculating' with a message saying, 'Nicky McSticky?'. Sheather's last victim was a woman called Catherine, who he texted at 5.30pm on April 10 saying, 'I'd love to take to [sic] downstairs and f*** your brains out in your pool while you look over the harbour'. Meanwhile, police say Sheather had similarly sent sexually explicit messages to a woman he had met on the dating website Plenty of Fish in November 2012, introducing himself as 'Rick Smithe'. The friendship ceased a month later after, police say, Sheather sent the woman, Deborah, 'a multimedia text message ... containing a photo of a penis ejaculating'. He contacted her again in January, 2013, to try and arrange a meeting but Deborah refused saying she 'did not feel comfortable'. At 7pm on March 11 this year, Deborah received a text from 'Rick's' mobile saying, 'Hello stranger' to which she did not reply. Sheather then sent her a text 'Want you so bad Deb' accompanied by a video she did not look at. She sent back a text saying, 'Taking my phone straight to the police station', to which he responded, 'You do that'. Deborah texted back, 'What is your problem? Don't you ever contact me again you disgusting pig'. After she contacted police at Maitland Local Area Command in the Hunter Valley north of Sydney, officers viewed the footage which they said 'consisted of a hand masturbating an erect penis and the penis ejaculating'. They telephoned Sheather and asked him for his date of birth and other personal details, which he refused, saying when officers told him they would identify him by other means, 'Well f***ing do it' before hanging up. At 7.30pm on April 23, police stopped Sheather in Vaucluse, in Sydney's eastern suburbs and asked if he owned an Apple iPhone 5, which he denied ever having. At 10.45am the following day officers executed a search warrant on his apartment in Cammeray, on Sydney's North Shore, where they found an Apple IPhone 5 charger in the bedroom plus a docket for its purchase, and seized a laptop. Sheather again denied owning an iPhone5, but after being taken to North Sydney Police Station he 'made a full and frank admission to all offences'. He told police the photos and videos were not of himself but that he had found them on the internet. He told police he had destroyed the iPhone just days earlier by smashing the iPhone 5 with a hammer and throwing it into a bin on New South Head Road in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Double Bay. He said he had thrown the SIM card from his car while driving through nearby Bellevue Hill . It is understood the 42-year-old will appeal his sentence.","A Sydney pool cleaner is the first man in NSW jailed for 'sexting'

"Caroline Star and her daughter Parisa (4), Kam and their one-year-old Roxana . Caroline Star sailed through her first pregnancy without even catching a cold. But when her baby daughter Parisa was just a week old, Caroline discovered her pregnancy hadn't been as smooth as she had thought. In fact, while she was still expecting, Caroline had caught a little-known but common virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV). This is harmless for the majority of adults and children and causes only mild, cold-like symptoms, if any. But if women catch it for the first time during pregnancy, it can be passed to unborn babies, with potentially devastating consequences. Caroline, 37, had no idea until her daughter was eight weeks old that she had been infected - and that Parisa was deaf as a result. Now four, Parisa is in some respects lucky, as only her hearing is affected. For CMV can also cause motor impairment, seizures, learning difficulties and visual impairment - which often may not be apparent for years. One in 150 babies in the UK is born with CMV every year, and one in 1,000 babies develops at least one serious problem as a result of the virus, according to the charity CMV Action. In fact, it is the most common reason children are born deaf or develop hearing problems. However, because there is no treatment or vaccine, most women are not warned about it for fear of panicking them. The virus is only harmful while the baby is in the womb, because unborn babies catch the virus through the blood supply from their mother. After birth, it is contracted in other ways - most often orally - when it is then intercepted by immune cells before it can do any damage. Around 60 per cent of adults carry CMV - it is part of the herpes simplex group of viruses also responsible for cold sores. Young children are more likely to spread it than adults, due to poorer hygiene. 'CMV is caught through bodily fluids, such as mucus, urine and saliva,' explains Paul Griffiths, a professor of virology at University College London. For this reason, he says: 'Those who are expecting or planning to get pregnant should wash their hands after changing nappies and not kiss young children on the mouth.' Other preventative measures include avoiding sharing food and drink with children, and using condoms while pregnant to avoid catching it from partners with the active virus. The virus crosses the placenta and infects the foetus in a third of women who catch it for the first time during pregnancy, says Professor Griffiths. Caroline contracted the CMV virus during her pregnancy with Parisa and now Parisa has severe hearing loss . 'About 25 per cent of those cases have some damage. It's the most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss and mental retardation in children. Yet we don't do enough about it.' Caroline, a former civil servant, who lives with her husband Kam, 40, an entrepreneur, Parisa and Roxanna, one, in Whitechapel, East London, believes she caught the virus after looking after her friends' infants while she was pregnant. 'Unwittingly, I put myself at higher risk of CMV by exposing myself to children's bodily fluids and not taking hygiene precautions,' she says. 'I felt guilty Parisa was affected by a virus I'd caught. If I'd known about CMV, I'd have done things differently.' It was only when Parisa failed a standard hearing test given to newborns that her mum knew there was a problem. Further tests revealed Parisa had profound sensorineural hearing loss. A blood test showed she had CMV. Because it can cause brain abnormalities, she also had a brain scan. 'The results were terrifying - the neurologist said it showed extensive abnormalities,' says Caroline. 'It seemed likely she'd develop mental problems, although it was impossible to predict as things such as epilepsy or behavioural problems can appear years later. She adds: 'Her first year was scary - we spent every minute checking that she wasn't doing something right, and with every shudder I'd worry she was having a fit.' Parisa was given hearing aids at two months, but her hearing deteriorated as the CMV spread and damaged more of the delicate hairs in the cochlea (inner ear) that relay sound waves to the hearing nerve. So at 18 months she needed a cochlear implant, where electrodes were threaded into her cochlea to do the job of the damaged hair cells. Lisa Midgley was also never warned about CMV and believes she caught it when pregnant from her then toddler daughter's 'sloppy kisses'. Her son Christian, now eight, was diagnosed with CMV days after birth. He failed a hearing test and a brain scan showed deposits of calcium (when cells are damaged by the virus an inflammatory response causes calcium to build up in the brain). Caroline believes she caught the virus after looking after her friends' infants while she was pregnant . 'Doctors didn't know what his future held, suggesting he may have low muscle tone and brain damage,' says Lisa, 39, a teaching assistant who lives in Bingley, West Yorkshire, with her husband Andrew, 39, a security surveyor and their other children Eve, ten, and Fearne, six. 'As a baby, he didn't feed easily, vomited constantly and hated being touched. Profound hearing loss was diagnosed at two months; at 18 months he needed cochlear implants.' Christian can now hear most sounds, but cannot talk or run, is fed through a tube, has autism and displays behaviour similar to that of a toddler. 'I was told about numerous conditions while pregnant but CMV was never mentioned,' says Lisa. Until 20 years ago, pregnant women were screened, via a blood test, for CMV. But reviews showed more than 100 women were unnecessarily worried for each at-risk case. Some who were thought to be at risk were given an amniocentesis, which involves inserting a needle into the womb to extract a sample of amniotic fluid. 'This procedure carries a miscarriage risk so we lost healthy babies,' says Professor Basky Thilaganathan, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. 'Some women whose babies had CMV terminated their pregnancies, although there was no way of knowing to what extent the virus had damaged them, if at all.' Dr Phil Rice, a consultant in microbiology at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, agrees that widespread screening 'would be a disaster'. 'There is no standardised test and some can be diabolical in accuracy,' he says. However, if babies born with CMV are diagnosed early, there is evidence taking an anti-viral drug for six weeks helps reduce their risk of further hearing and brain problems. Professor Griffiths says: 'But sometimes subtle symptoms aren't recognised early and there is no evidence it helps if taken after the baby is 30 days old.' Transplant patients, who have impaired immune systems, can also be harmed by the virus, so their blood is routinely monitored for it. Professor Griffiths has been working on a vaccine to protect these patients, which could potentially be given to women, too. The vaccine has showed 'encouraging results' and another trial is expected this year. Meanwhile, mothers such as Lisa wish more was done to warn about this virus. As she says: 'Christian's problems could have been avoided if I'd known about CMV and done things differently.' cmvaction.org.uk .","Caroline Star, 37, from Whitechapel, had cytomegalovirus while pregnant .

"Angry travellers have taken to social media in frustration after Jetstar's website and phone lines crashed in the midst of a one day sale frenzy. Thousands tried to snap up cheap $88 flights from Australia to Bali when seats went on sale at 4pm on Monday, but Jetstar's systems crashed soon after it began. The cheap flights were released in competition with Air Asia's $99 fares on flights from Melbourne to Bali to celebrate entering the competitive Australia-South East Asia travel market. Scroll down for video . Angry travellers have taken to social media in frustration after Jetstar's website and phone lines crashed in the midst of a one day sale frenzy on Monday afternoon . As angry travellers vented on Twitter using the hashtag #JetstarFail, the airline apologised to its customers. A Jetstar spokesman said on Tuesday that the popularity of the sale put significant pressure on the airline's booking system, News Corp reports. 'While customers were able to book throughout the night the heavy traffic on out website meant some customers had difficulty purchasing the sale fares,' he said. 'Our web team worked hard to fix the website's performance overnight and there are plenty of sale fares still available for travellers this morning.' Some would-be travellers claimed they spent six hours trying to snap up the cheap fares.

As angry travellers vented on Twitter, with some accusing the airline of staging a publicity stunt, Jetstar apologised to its customers . It comes as Jetstar announced it will slash its carry-on baggage allowance for economy passengers by three kilos as the Australian airline cracks down on overweight luggage. The maximum weight per cabin bag is decreasing from 10kg to 7kg on most Jetstar flights from next month. The changes will come into effect on flights booked from today, but weight restrictions will not be implemented until November 25. Passengers who booked flights prior to October 28 will still be allowed to bring up to 10kg on-board. Under the changes, economy passengers can bring one main item of carry-on luggage and one other small item, like a handbag, with a total combined weight of up to 7kg. The maximum weight per cabin bag is decreasing from 10kg to 7kg on most Jetstar flights from next month . Business class passengers will be entitled to two bags as long as they don't weigh more than 7kg each - down from the combined 20kg they were entitled to prior to the changes. 'We know many customers get frustrated when there is not enough room for their bags in overhead lockers,' a Jetstar spokesman said. 'To address this we are reducing the amount of baggage that customers can bring on board, which will align us with other carriers in Australia and across the Asia Pacific region. 'This change will help speed up the boarding process, enable more flights to depart on time and ensure all customers get their fair share of overhead locker space.' The changes will come into effect on flights booked from today, but weight restrictions will not be implemented until November 25 . Jetstar passengers can expect a $50 fee if their cabin baggage exceeds the weight and height dimensions and has to be checked at the gate. The airline's cabin baggage officers are now checking passengers at Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast airports in a bid to crack down on overweight luggage.

"The family of a postal worker named as being a mole working with the Great Train Robbers has dismissed the claims - insisting he never flashed the cash. Gordon Goody, 85, a surviving member of the gang, has named Patrick McKenna as the inside man in a new documentary. He broke his 51-year silence to reveal the identity of the man previously known only as The Ulsterman. The family of Patrick McKenna (pictured) have dismissed claims he was a mole working with the Great Train Robbers insisting he never flashed the cash . Gordon Goody (pictured), 85, has named Patrick McKenna as the inside man in a new documentary . But the family of Mr McKenna, a quiet Post Office employee who died with just £3,000 in his bank account, say they find it hard to believe he was the middleman. 'He was very straitlaced and honest,' his grandson, Mark McKenna, said. 'When I was young I remember going shopping with him at Asda. Me and my mum lived with my grandparents, so he was like my dad. Mark McKenna, pictured, has described his grandfather as 'strait-laced and honest' 'He was one of those who would sit there at the end of the month comparing his till receipts to his bank statement.' The 41-year-old, of Eccles, Salford, added: 'When mum was younger they struggled with money. 'She was walking around with holes in her shoes. 'Every time he bought a car it had to be on hire purchase. 'It's obviously quite a shock that he could have been involved in something like this. 'My reaction was, ""What, my grandad?"" My mum doesn't believe it at all.' Mr McKenna says that by 1963, his grandfather had left London for the north west to live near his wife's family. He says his grandfather, who died of a heart attack in 1992, never showed any sign of having a large amount of cash that would indicate he had been involved in a heist. 'If he did get this kind of money, none of us ever saw any of it,' he said. 'I am still finding it all very hard to believe because of the kind of person that he was. 'The documentary makers insist it can't be anyone else, however.' Police examining one of the coaches of the train near Bridego Railway Bridge in Buckinghamshire the morning after the train was robbed . Three handcuffed men arrested in connection with the great train robbery have blankets draped over their heads as they leave Linslade Court where they were remanded in custody for eight days . Goody's account is that McKenna picked up his share - the equivalent of several million pounds today - in two holdalls and a mailbag and piled them into the boot of a grey Austin car. Goody has revealed all for a new film made in the wake of the deaths last year of other Great Train Robbers, including Ronnie Biggs. The Great British Train Robbery: A Tale of Two Thieves is in cinemas on Friday and on DVD, Blu-ray and download from October 6. Bruce Reynolds . Gang-leader and mastermind Reynolds was nicknamed 'Napoleon' and after the Great Train Robbery he fled to Mexico on a false passport and was joined by his wife, Angela, and son, Nick. They later moved on to Canada but the cash from the robbery ran out and he came back to England. Five years after the heist, in 1968, a broke Reynolds was captured in Torquay and sentenced to 25 years in jail. He was released on parole in 1978 and moved, alone and penniless, into a tiny flat off London's Edgware Road. In the 1980s he was jailed for three years for dealing amphetamines. After his second release, Reynolds went on to work briefly as a consultant on a film about the robbery, Buster, and published the Autobiography of a Thief in 1995. His son Nick said his father died in his sleep in the early hours of February 28 2013. Great Train Robbers all together at the launch of a book. (L-R) Buster Edwards, Tommy Wisbey, Jim White, Bruce Reynolds, Roger Cordrey, Charles Wilson and Jim Hussey . Ronnie Biggs . Ronald Arthur 'Ronnie' Biggs played a minor role in the robbery, but his life as a fugitive after escaping from prison gained him notoriety. He was given a 30-year sentence in 1964, but he escaped after 15 months by fleeing over the walls of London's Wandsworth prison in April 1965. After having plastic surgery, he lived as a fugitive for 36 years in first Australia then Brazil, where he fathered a son Michael. His health deteriorated in 2001 and he returned to the UK voluntarily where he was sent back to prison. He was finally freed in 2009 on 'compassionate grounds' by then Justice Secretary Jack Straw who said he was not expected to recover. Ronald 'Buster' Edwards . An ex-boxer, club owner and small-time crook who fled to Mexico after the heist but gave himself up in 1966. Edwards is widely believed to be the man who wielded the cosh used to hit train driver Jack Mills over the head. Mills' family say he never recovered, and he died seven years later. Edwards served nine years in jail and then became a familiar figure selling flowers outside Waterloo station in London. He was the subject of the 1988 film Buster, in which he was played by Phil Collins.Edwards was found hanged in a garage in 1994 at the age of 62. Two wreaths in the shape of trains accompanied his funeral cortège. Charlie Wilson . Wilson was the gang's 'treasurer' who gave each of the robbers their cut of the haul.He was captured quickly and during his trial at Aylesbury Crown Court in 1964 earned the nickname 'the silent man' as he refused to say anything. He was jailed for 30 years but escaped after just four months. He was captured again in Canada after four years on the run and served 10 more years in jail. He was the final train robber to emerge from prison in 1978. Wilson moved to Marbella, Spain, where he was shot and killed by a hitman on a bicycle in 1990.

He died in a motorway crash in 1979. Bill Boal . Police seize bags of cash following the heist . An engineer who was arrested with Roger Cordrey in possession of £141,000.Reynolds said he had never heard of Boal. He claimed Boal was not involved in the robbery and was ""an innocent man"". Boal was charged with receiving stolen goods and jailed for 24 years, which was reduced to 14 on appeal. He died of cancer in jail in 1970. Tommy Wisbey . A bookie and self-confessed 'heavy' whose job in the heist was to frighten the train staff. Wisbey was sentenced to 30 years and released in 1976.

"Thieves have stolen the laptop of a 12-year-old boy then hacked into his Facebook account and left mocking messages. Christian Swan also lost several tailor-made dance costumes he was planning to use for an upcoming performance when the burglars broke in to the family's loan car between 1pm and 5pm on Saturday in a south Auckland car park. Swan then found his Facebook account had been hacked into by the thieves, who wrote insulting messages to taunt the Belmore Intermediate student, New Zealand Herald has reported. Christian Swan, 12, was at a musical performance with his family when their mechanic loaned car was broken into and his laptop was stolen . The cruel message that was posted on his Facebook: Swan said the ordeal had left him shaken, fearing the thieves would be able to find his home . Swan found the following message on his account: 'HA HA ARE YOU MISSING ANYTHING BETCH CATCH ME IF YOU CAN IM THE GINGER BREAD MAN.'

"Smoking could be phased out in 2018 in Tasmania for young Australians . A generation of Australians could be on the brink of living a tobacco-free existence if a move to ban the sale of cigarettes to young people is successful. The 'tobacco-free' generation bill is set to be introduced into Tasmanian parliament this year, which would make it illegal for people born after the year 2000 to buy cigarettes and for retailers to sell tobacco-laced products to them. The law would come into effect in 2018 and would mean people aged 14 this year would not be able to buy cigarettes once they turn 18. Harsh penalties would also be imposed on anyone caught supplying tobacco to the 'tobacco-free generation' whether they're a retailer or an individual. Tasmanian Independent Member of the Legislative Council Ivan Dean is the brains behind the idea and will put the motion to the Tasmanian parliament in the next two months. He said the move is not designed to penalise  individuals but to better the health of young Australians. 'What we are saying is that anyone who turns 18 in 2018 will not be able to buy cigarettes and eventually when older smokers die out in 20, 30 years time the sale will end,' he said. 'The important thing is that this is not about criminalising the smokers - it's ensuring retailers and suppliers can't sell to anybody born after the year 2000.' Those aged 14-and-under could soon be banned from buying cigarettes from Tasmanian retailers under new laws which would come into effect in 2018 . The idea has received backing from  the Tasmanian branch of the Australian Medical Association, whose president Tim Greenaway said any effort to reduce levels of smoking in the community is well supported. Mr Dean will bring the private members bill before parliament in November, at the latest, and then open up the conversation for debate next year. If successful, the legislation would be implemented by 2018 making it illegal for people aged 18 and under  to buy tobacco in Tasmania. Although this particular law would only imply to that state, Mr Dean said he hopes other Australian states and territories would follow suit. Ivan Dean will introduce a bill to ban smoking for 18-year-old Australians in 2018 . He said Tasmania has been the fore runner in introducing no-smoking policies across the country. 'If it works other states and territories should consider adopting the plan,' he said. 'Tasmania has been the forerunner in setting policy in relation to smoking in many areas. 'We were one of the first states to introduce no smoking in vehicles, no smoking in public places, sporting venues and kids play areas.' 'We have consistently set the pattern on no smoking legislation.' The push for a tobacco-free generation in Tasmania began two years ago when the Upper House unanimously supported the idea and the Government commissioned a report into the plan from the Children's Commissioner. Mr Deane said smoking was a 20th-century phenomenon and with all the known risks associated with the activity there should be more done to eradicate it. 'Smoking was a 20th century phenomenon — tobacco-free is a 21st century phenomenon. 'We need to push it as hard as we can.'","Tasmanian Independent Ivan Dean is set to introduce bill banning sale of smoking in the state to people born after year 2000 .

"A photographer has revealed amazing images of the night sky above beautiful vistas on Earth. In the images, hundreds of stars are seen shooting forwards and streaking across the night sky with short bursts of light. And elsewhere these stars create incredible swirling patterns, spiralling above a large rock jutting through the calm sea. Photographer Maurizio Pignotti has revealed amazing images of the night sky above beautiful vistas on Earth, created by Earth's rotation . The magnificent star trails are created by the Earth's rotation and were captured by Maurizio Pignotti from Civitanova, Italy. They were taken in various locations including  the Pollino National Park, in the Conero Regional Park, Gargano National Park and the National Park of the Sibillini Mountains in Italy. From one bright star illuminating an old tree stump, to skies filled with hundreds of small stars, Mr Pignotti said he has a passion for catching magical night skies on camera. He described each outing as an 'adventure alone', unafraid of difficult conditions and journeying from sea caves to the highlands of Castellucio. He said: 'My favourite photo is the image of the caves - it was a great adventure, positioned in the caves at night all alone. I was totally immersed in sea water to take only a few clicks. 'You can even see my tent in one of the caves.'

Mr Pignotti describes each outing as an 'adventure alone', unafraid of difficult conditions and journeying from sea caves to the highlands of Castellucio . And the freelance photographer refuses to use any editing. Maurizio said: 'These are all photographed using different techniques. The spiral effect was created by the Earth's rotation and a long exposure combined with a zooming machine. 'The star trails all move in different directions because of the sphericity of the sky - I just add some zooming techniques, and then I get this particular effect.' The freelance photographer refuses to use any editing. He said: 'These are all photographed using different techniques. The spiral effect was created by the Earth's rotation and a long exposure combined with a zooming machine' Mr Pignotti said it takes anywhere from 20 seconds up to three hours to create each image - relying on the natural turning of the globe for a good result . Mr Pignotti travelled to some stunning locations in order to take the time-lapse photography, which involves setting up a camera and taking a long-exposure shot to capture the motion of slow moving objects, in this case stars, in images . Maurizio takes anywhere from 20 seconds up to three hours to create each image - relying on the natural turning of the globe for a good result. He even managed to capture some familiar star formations, including the star cluster Pleiades - visible in his photo with the tree and the moon in the centre. The 46-year-old added: 'As a child I had a passion for astronomy, the starry night sky has always fascinated me. I love the charm and mystery of the night in these photos. 'They just reveal the infinity of the cosmos.' Mr Pignotti said this is his favourite photo. 'It was a great adventure, positioned in the caves at night all alone,' he said. 'I was totally immersed in sea water to take only a few clicks. You can even see my tent in one of the caves' In this image the beauty of the Milky Way can be seen rising into the night sky.

"He may be one sixth of showbiz's most famous family and the star of Burberry's Christmas campaign, but  Romeo Beckham proved he's just the average excitable 12-year-old at heart last night. The young model was at Burberry's Regent Street flagship store to preview his new campaign film and the proud youngster turned it into a family affair. Clearly chuffed with his starring role for the iconic British brand, Romeo invited his mother Victoria, father David, both sets of grandparents and his school friend along to watch. FEMAIL went along to watch the youngster make his second campaign appearance for the brand and it was hard not to notice what a proud and down-to-earth family the Beckhams are - despite the immense fame and fortune that's come their way over the years. Scroll down for video . Having a blast: Romeo Beckham made headline news when he was unveiled as Burberry's Christmas campaign star and as these behind the scenes shots prove, he had a brilliant time in his starring role . After making his solo red carpet appearance, Romeo and his entourage, waited patiently in a side entrance where Burberry boss Christopher Bailey greeted them. Obviously happy to see his new campaign star, Christopher showered Romeo with a warm welcome and knelt down to give him a quick pep talk before Romeo made his way through the crowd. Proud: Chuffed Romeo brought his parents along to the launch of his new campaign and was treated to a quick pep chat from Christopher Bailey, pictured, before he made his appearance . Delightful: Christopher Bailey said that Romeo was an 'utter joy' to work with on his new campaign and brought along some serious style and charm . Clearly unphased by the 500 guests waiting for the man of the night, Romeo strode confidently ahead of his entire entourage and smiled broadly as he walked through the room. He and his family made their way up to a VIP balcony where they enjoyed a musical performance by British songwriter Ed Harcourt, who wrote the score for the From London with Love film. Romeo was seen giggling proudly as his campaign film was revealed and watched the entire thing in the arms of his mother, who tenderly whispered into her young son's ear throughout. Unlike a lot of celebrities, who often show up to an event just for the photocall and quickly dash off, the Beckhams stayed for the entire evening. Stealing the show: Clearly unphased by the 500 guests waiting for the man of the night, Romeo, pictured behind the scenes on his new campaign, strode confidently ahead of his entire entourage and smiled broadly as he walked through the room at last night's launch . Budding model: Following his mother into the fashion world, the youngster was hand-picked by the British label's Chief Creative Officer, Christopher Bailey, for the second time . Romeo confidently mingled with VIP guests and was seen having a photo taken with his equally dapper young school friend, who was enjoying a mocktail. David's mother Sandra proved to be the proud grandmother and was seen taking snaps of her grandson on her mobile phone, whilst Victoria engaged in an intimate - and probably fashion-related - chat with Christopher Bailey. Another star of the evening was Hannah Dodds, the blonde model and dancer who features alongside Romeo in the campaign. She was congratulated on her role by fellow guests, who included Benjamin Clementine, George Ezra, Sophie Ellis Bextor and some of the Made In Chelsea cast. Just another day in the office: Romeo may only be 12 but he's already following in his successful parents' fashionable footsteps . Romeo, who is the second eldest son of David and Victoria, steals the spotlight in the Burberry Festive campaign and judging by these behind the scene pictures, he had a blast doing it. Following his mother into the fashion world, the youngster was hand-picked by the British label's Chief Creative Officer, Christopher Bailey, for the second time. Speaking about the campaign and working with the young Beckham, Christopher Bailey said: 'This festive campaign is a celebration of everything we love at Burberry; the trench coat, the cashmere scarf, incredible music, our British weather, and working with great and talented people. 'It continues to be an utter joy working with Romeo - he has charm, style and great energy! I’m delighted that he’s the lead role in our festive campaign.' Time for bed: Romeo left the event at 8pm - no doubt to get an early night before school today . He's a pro!

"He's still puffing away on 70 cigarettes a day but the new James Bond wants to settle down, the author of the latest spy novel has revealed. Speaking at the launch of Solo in London yesterday, author William Boyd claimed the 007 star is not after casual sex – he wants a relationship. And while the old Mr Bond has always enjoyed a single egg boiled for precisely 3 and a 1/3 minutes for breakfast, Mr Boyd has turned him into a man who prefers his eggs scrambled. Solo author William Boyd revealed a few changes in 007's character but said he wanted to keep the character . much the same as he was in the past . Mr Boyd is the third author to be invited by the Fleming estate to write an official Bond novel, following in the footsteps of Sebastian Faulkes and Jeffery Deaver. Solo is set in West Africa in 1969 when Bond is aged 45. Bond’s mission takes him across the continent to Africa, which is embroiled in a civil war, and to America – via a multitude of Martinis and two different women. Mr Boyd, who has written screenplays for films starring the three Bond actors, said his book had the ‘classic ingredients of a Bond novel’ and he had not bowed to pressure to make Bond more acceptable to ‘modern sensibilities’. He said: ‘Times have changed but Bond is a heavy smoker, there is a wonderful line in one of the novels, which is Bond lit his 70th cigarette of the day. ‘I have no desire to water down or make Bond more acceptable to modern sensibilities. Actor Daniel Craig has starred  in the past three James Bond films but doesn't have the right physique to play the agent described in Solo according to Boyd . ‘He drinks, he smokes, he does everything you would expect of a classic Bond.’ And although Mr Boyd’s 007 is in bed with a beautiful woman by page 86 of the novel, it seems his interpretation of Mr Bond’s love life is wholly dissimilar from Mr Fleming’s. When asked who his favourite ‘Bond Girl’ was, Mr Boyd responded: ‘I’m not too keen on the expression Bond Girl because I think that Bond has relationships with women and I do think he wants a relationship, not just casual sex.’ Mr Boyd said earlier this month he had deliberately written about the spy's relationships with women differently, saying of Fleming’s novels: ‘The sex can veer from terrible Barbara Cartland romanticism to almost sadism.’ He also revealed yesterday he had had ‘discussions’ with actor Daniel Craig – who played James Bond in the latest film - about whether he should write the book. But he said - should there be a film made of his book - Mr Craig did not have the correct ‘physique’ for the part of the secret agent, and he would sooner choose film-star Daniel Day-Lewis. He said: ‘I think Daniel is an astonishing actor actually, even though he’s physically not like the Bond described in the novel. ‘If there was an actor to play my James Bond I’d choose another actor who has been in a film of mine, Daniel Day Lewis, because I think he actually resembles the Bond that Fleming describes.’ He added that Fleming once described Bond as ‘looking like the American singer-songwriter Hoagy Carmichael. Daniel Day-Lewis looks like Hoagy Carmichael.’ Fittingly, the book launch was held at the five-star Dorchester hotel in central London – the venue for the opening of Solo. William Boyd said he had no desire to 'water down or make Bond (played here by actor Daniel Craig) more acceptable to modern sensibilities' In the first chapter of the book, Bond heads to the dining room in the hotel on his 45th birthday and orders ‘four eggs, scrambled, and half a dozen rashers of unsmoked back bacon, well done, on the side’. In Fleming's novels, Bond enjoys boiled eggs from Maran hens, boiled for three and a third minutes each, eaten off Minton china, with toast. Lucy Fleming, the niece of Bond creator Mr Fleming, said her uncle would have approved of the novel greatly. The novel takes 007 into war-torn Africa as the 1960s come to an end. Boyd (right) follows in the footsteps of authors including Kingsley Amis and Sebastian Faulks, who have both written new Bond books since the death of his creator, Ian Fleming, in 1964 . Speaking at the launch she said: ‘Did you know that breakfast was Bond’s favourite meal of the day?’ Seven numbered and signed copies of the book were driven off from the hotel in vintage Jensen cars like the vehicle Bond drives in the novel and flown around the world. This year marks the 60th anniversary of the publication of Fleming’s first Bond novel, Casino Royale. He wrote 14 Bond books and the series has sold more than 100 million titles.","Author said he didn't want to 'water down' beloved character to suit modern audiences .

"The former cabinet minister Tony Benn died in March at his home in west London . Tony Benn left more than £5 million in his will – but not a single penny is going to the Labour Party or any of the radical causes he championed. The former Labour Cabinet Minister, who died aged 88 in March, bequeathed the bulk of his fortune to his four children. Benn, who supported the introduction of a wealth tax, left an estate of £5,085,001, reduced after liabilities to £5,020,389, probate records revealed yesterday. It is believed that his four children Stephen, 63, Hilary, 60, Melissa, 57, and Joshua, 56, will inherit about £800,000 each after payment of inheritance tax. Benn’s wife Caroline died in 2000 after 51 years of marriage. The will left nothing to Labour or any of the Left-wing groups – including the Stop the War coalition or the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament – which Benn supported. But he stated that any future profits from his diaries could go to charities or other bodies at the discretion of his children. The will, which was drawn up in 2004, also left £1,000 each to two women, believed to be friends or carers, and £25,000 to Ruth Winstone, who edited his diaries. Benn, who in his later years became a widely loved elder statesman of British politics, was a leading figure in the radical Left wing of the Labour Party in his heyday in the 1960s and 1970s. Tony Benn with his wife Caroline and children, from left, Joshua, Hilary, Stephen and Melissa, in 1959 . Only one of his children followed him into politics: Hilary Benn has been Labour MP for Leeds Central since 1999 and is currently shadow Communities Secretary. Benn’s eldest son Stephen, who inherited the Viscount Stansgate title that he famously renounced, is director of Parliamentary affairs for the Society of Biology. Joshua is an IT professional while Melissa is a radical feminist author. Benn and his wife brought up their children in a rambling four storey Regency house in Holland Park, West London. The property was believed to have been worth £3 million when he downsized in 2011 to a warden-controlled flat nearby. Benn also owned an ancestral home, Stansgate Abbey Farm on the Blackwater estuary in Essex. His will requested that the property be left in trust for his family. Benn was Britain’s youngest serving MP when he was first elected in 1950 at the age of 25. But after inheriting the title Viscount Stansgate on the death of his father in 1960, he was disbarred from the House of Commons. But he successfully campaigned for a change in the law allowing him to renounce his title and retake his Bristol South East seat in 1963. Under the Labour governments of 1964-1970 and 1974-1979, he held several high-profile Cabinet positions including Secretary of State for Energy and Secretary of State for Industry. The politician finally retired from Parliament in 2001, as he famously declared, ‘to spend more time on politics’.","Former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn died aged 88 in March .

"A mother whose weight ballooned to 19st after snacking on crisps and chocolate every two hours has shed more than nine stone. Rachel Baker, 32, from Addlestone, Surrey, had gained weight steadily since her teens, eating big meals including frozen ready meals and takeaways and frequently snacking on crisps, chocolate and fizzy drinks. Her weight crept up to 19 stone after giving birth to son, and she realised that she couldn’t bend down to tie her shoelaces without getting breathless. Her doctor had also warned that her body mass index (BMI) was 'off the chart'. Rachel Baker, 32, has gone down from a size 22 (left) to a slim size 8 (right) after realising she was so obese she was breathless tying her own shoelaces . Ms Baker said before losing the weight (left) she loved toast, frozen ready meals, roast dinners and desserts, whereas now (right) she eats porridge, soup and fresh fish with vegetables . Ms Baker  was always overweight as a teenager, but after putting on three stone after the birth of her son, now two, her weight spiralled out of control. She became so obese a doctor said her BMI was 'off the scale' A doctor told her she was so obese that her BMI, previously 43 before her pregnancy, was now off the scale, and this spurred her to lose weight through the LighterLife diet plan and taking more exercise. LighterLife is a diet plan in which food is replaced with ready-mixed packs or shakes which contain all the nutrients a person's body would need in a day, but totalling only 600 calories. Ms Baker also attended weekly weighing and counselling sessions which helped her learn how to cook healthy meals, avoid the urge to eat and keep the weight off long-term. Since shedding the weight 11 months ago Ms Baker says she is able to race around with her son and now has achieved her goal of looking elegant while driving a carriage. Mrs Baker said: 'I realised I was holding my breath to do up my shoes and the shock of this was my lowest point. ‘I had the big tire around my middle. It was pressing on my chest so I couldn’t breathe. ‘Then I thought “I wonder how heavy I am”. 'I wasn't paying attention because I was running around after my son. I was looking after him but not after myself. ‘My son is young and active and I didn’t want to miss any moments while he was playing sports or running around outside’ Ms Baker said she had been overweight since her teenage years. She said: ‘I’ve always been bigger. I remember being 13 in secondary school and having meetings with the school dietitian because I was bigger than I was supposed to be. Ms Baker decided to join LighterLife's weight loss programme and through changing her diet and carrying out exercise, she managed to lose nearly 10 stone in under a year . A doctor said Ms Baker's BMI, which was over 43, was so high it was 'off the scale'. A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 25 . BEFORE: . Breakfast: Two slices of toast with buttered jam . Mid-morning: Packet of crisps or chocolate bar and some fruit . 11am: Another similar snack . Lunch: Two rounds of sandwiches with corned beef, egg mayonnaise or tuna mayonaise, a pack of crisps, a yoghurt, a chocolate or Frusli bar . 2pm: Another snack, typically like crisps or ypghurt, . 4pm: Crackers with cream cheese . Dinner: A big dinner, such as pasta and sauce with cheese, spaghetti bolognaise, lasagne, frozen southern fried chicken with chips and peas, frozen chip shop fish, or a chicken Korma curry with rice and peshwari naan. Always had a dessert like bread and butter pudding, slice of cheesecake or half a tub of Haagen Daz ice cream . On weekends, Ms Baker would always eat a full roast dinner . 8pm: A snack such as biscuits, a chocolate bar or crisps . Drinks: Tea with milk throughout the dayFizzy drinks such as diet coke . AFTER: . Breakfast: A controlled amount of porridge oats and soya light milk . Black coffees, leaf teas . Mid-morning: Tub of carrot sticks, tub of grapes, tub of trail mix (sunflower, pumpkin seeds, almonds, crushed walnuts and small amounts if dried fruit) Lunch: Soup or salad with sweet chilli sauce . Dinner: Fish such as haddock, plaice or salmon baked in olive oil with peas, a pulse mix or some broccoli. Malteasers as a dessert . ‘I was always conscious that I was bigger than my friends.’ At age 22, she decided to lose weight and went to the gym, even running a 5km Race for Life. But after the birth of her son she could no longer maintain such an exercise regime. She said her pregnancy weight, combined with a lack of exercise and a near-addiction to unhealthy food, meant her weight began to soar. She said: ‘I love food, I love Italians, Chinese, Mexican, Indian. ‘I always ate dessert, that was the pleasing part of the meal. ‘My intake was high but my exercise was low. ‘Then I got pregnant and put on an extra three stone. The amount of food that went into my body was just incredible.' She added she didn’t realise her weight was so high: ‘When you put on a couple of pounds a month, you don’t notice. 'If your jeans get a bit tight you don’t really notice, you just wear something else in your wardrobe.’ The moment she realised she was breathless bending down to tie her laces was the ‘trigger’ moment. After this she went to her GP, who confirmed that her BMI, which was 43 before she became pregnant, was now so high it was ‘off the scale’. Ms Baker was officially classed as 'morbidly obese' at over 43, well outside the healthy range of 18.5 to 25. She looked around for a weight loss programme . ‘I was conscious of Pauline Quirke’s story. That’s when I found LighterLife. 'I went for a consultation and I liked the weekly group sessions. After I’d done a couple of weeks I didn’t worry about not being with my family. I enjoyed it, it was time for me. 'We didn’t talk about dieting and calories and food. It was like life lessons. It was about identifying the eating triggers. We did things like worry trees. 'So we resolved our life issues so we didn’t need food to solve it. 'Tiredness was a big factor for me. I had a time between 7 and 8, after dinner, child in bed, and that time was snack time. 'I would pick up something that I wouldn’t need for nutrition.' Sticking to the diet, she managed to lose between two and six pounds a week, eventually shedding almost 10 stone. Ms Baker’s hobby is horse carriage driving and so she decided to set herself a goal of losing weight so she could feel graceful at the reins. She said: ‘I have been driving carriages for two and a half years. I show my mother’s horse and drive around the country showing the horse. ‘When I was getting to the end of the season, I was going into a new class where I needed a sense of elegance.

Nasser Hussain: Cricket will take stock after Hughes' death, do everything it can, but ultimately it will carry on. It has to... David Lloyd: The Hughes accident is tragic and my heart goes out to Sean Abbott . Paul Newman's obituary . Andrew Strauss believes the game of cricket has never been safer, despite the death of Phillip Hughes on Thursday at the age of 25. Hughes died two days after being struck on the head by a bouncer while batting for South Australia against New South Wales but Strauss, who played with the Aussie at Middlesex, said a player no longer went out to bat 'worrying that his life might be on the line' and urged the powers that be not to consider banning short deliveries. The former England captain admitted the natural response to such a tragedy was to assume 'massive changes' were needed, but said on Sky Sports News: 'The protection in the game of cricket has never been better than it is today. Andrew Strauss thinks the game of cricket has never been safer despite the death of Phillip Hughes . 'I don't think any cricketer will go out there to bat these days worrying that his life might be on the line. I think in the old days, pre-helmet, that did used to take place quite often, these days it doesn't happen. 'I think it's really important we investigate this fully and see what can be done. I would hate to see a situation where bowlers can't bowl short balls. 'That is the element of bat versus ball and there has got to be a little bit of an element of, not fear, but, as a batsman, you have to protect yourself and if you lose that I think it shifts the balance between bat and ball too firmly in the favour of the batsman. 'Let's look if we can do anything more on the protection side. I don't know the full details of it, it sounds like he got hit on the neck, which is not usually a particularly dangerous place to get hit. 'I've been hit on the neck a number of times, I can remember twice by Brett Lee in the same Test match, so whether this is just one of those freak, tragic accidents or not remains to be seen.' Hughes died on Thursday afternoon, two days after being hit on the head by a bouncer in Sydney . The Australian batsman was taken to hospital in Sydney after being hit by a delivery from Sean Abbott . Another former England skipper Michael Atherton said Hughes' death would 'shake' batsmen into recognising the importance of safety. He said: 'It's an incredibly safe game but I think this will shake batsmen slightly out of what might have been complacency. 'I wore the same helmet for 10 years. I never changed it. I didn't give it much thought really. If there is that kind of complacency that I was guilty of, then I think people will be shaken out of that. 'I'll be making sure my 12-year-old boy's helmet is up to scratch and the latest model. But fundamentally, it's a safe game with risk attached.' The Australian flag was raised at half-mast at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Hughes' death . Nasser Hussain added: 'You have to think about ways of improving the helmet all the time, balancing protection with being able to move and see the ball. 'Putting bits on the neck...is an area we've never thought about. We were always told to protect the temple but were never really concerned about the neck. 'The instinct to get out of the way of a bouncer is to turn away - this will send shock waves through every cricketer.' Shaun Udal, who played alongside Hughes with Middlesex in 2009, said: 'Unfortunately the ball missed his helmet - if it had hit it he might still be with us. 'This highlights the need to keep progressing and moving forward. In the helmet industry this is being done.'","Phillip Hughes died aged 25 after being hit on the head by a bouncer .

"Newsnight's viewers accused the BBC of 'new depths of dumbing down' last night after it interviewed the Great British Bake Off contestant forced off the show when his Baked Alaska collapsed. Presenter Kirsty Wark and baker Iain Watters both wore aprons in the three minute segment as they discussed the scandal and ate some of the 31-year-old's best cakes. The bearded baker lost his cool when his ice cream filled pudding melted after rival contestant Diana Beard took it out of the freezer - leading Mr Watters to throw it in the bin. The controversy whipped up anger among viewers who accused Mrs Beard, 69, of sabotaging the pudding, and led to Watters' his exit from the show. But furious Newsnight fans rushed to criticise the decision to feature the story on the BBC's flagship current affairs show and said standards have slipped since Jeremy Paxman left this summer. Controversial: The melting of Iain Watters' Baked Alaska enthralled millions of Bake Off fans this week but Newsnight viewers turned on the show and said it should never have been featured . Critique: People took to Twitter the highlight the 'dumbing down' of the BBC's flagship news show . Yesterday the BBC's former editorial boss Peter Mosey said the programme’s under-fire editor Ian Katz is struggling to recover from the departure of its main presenter in June. Paxman's own parting shot after 25 years at the helm was that the show was 'made by 13-year-olds'  and its producers were 'idealists' on a 'fool’s errand'. Newsnight's has lost five per cent of its viewers in the past year. Ian Francis ‏tweeted: 'How many additional viewers has #Newsnight put on since it began dumbing down. Last night featured 'interview' with Bake Off contestant! Bryan Robson tweeted: 'So Russia's invading Ukraine, our own country could split within the month, and are interviewing the bloke from the Bake Off. Tom Jamieson ‏said: 'Iain from Bake Off on Newsnight, whilst over on Chatty Man Alan Carr is discussing the Ukrainian invasion with the Russian Foreign Minister. @NickMotown tweeted: 'Ian (sic) from Bake Off is on Newsnight tonight. How I wish Paxman were still there. His contempt, harnessed, could power a small African village'. Ben Dirs said: Newsnight doing a segment on a Great British Bake Off controversy - I imagine Jeremy Paxman crying and laughing while stabbing a sponge cake. He added: 'Kirsty Wark: ""How many people died in Libya today?! Blimey. Wow. Anyway, have you edited that segment on the baked alaska yet?"" Criticisms: Viewers and experts have said that Newsnight has struggled . Tom Wilson ‏wrote: 'Newsnight, the gritty, hard hitting news show covering Great British Bake Off Baked Alaska controversies'. Edd Kimber said: '#bingate is being featured in tonight's Newsnight?! Bake Off is still about cake right? Didn't change to politics did it?' Away from Newsnight the melting of Iain Watters' Baked Alaska has enthralled fans. Great British Bake Off contestant Diana Beard has revealed she left the show but not because of the ice cream pudding controversy, because she lost her sense of smell and taste when she fainted. But Mrs Beard, 69, said she wept as she claimed the corporation had cast her as the villain, deliberately editing the show to make it look as if she had left the dessert out of the freezer for several minutes. The scandal is the biggest to hit Bake Off since last year’s Custardgate drama, when one contestant tearfully admitted taking another’s custard to use in a trifle. Getting to the soggy bottom of the baked Alaska incident, however, was proving rather more difficult last night. Popular: The Bake Off had more than eight million viewers on Wednesday night - but the 590,000 who watch Newsnight were less interested . Massive scandal: Iain threw his soupy Baked Alaska (pictured) in the bin in a fit of frozen meringue pique . The story starts on Wednesday when 8million viewers watched bearded Iain Watters, 31, throw a wobbly when he found his dessert had been reduced to a splodge after Mrs Beard took it out of the freezer. He was eliminated after he presented it in a bin to judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, then stormed off set. That led to Mrs Beard, from Shropshire, being pilloried as a cheat in cruel online comments. There were more than 550 complaints to the BBC. She, however, insisted the recording had been edited to make it seem as if she had left the meringue and ice cream dessert out for minutes, rather than seconds. ‘They deliberately misled viewers and exploited me for the sake of entertainment,’ she said. ‘The BBC should be ashamed. ‘The cake was out of the freezer for 40 seconds and I was asking who it belonged to. Then Iain walked over and took it away. It happened as simply as that. ‘Iain didn’t blame me at all. I was very disappointed and upset by how they cleverly edited the show and as a result I have people saying all sorts of nasty things about me.’ A BBC spokesman said: 'The ""Bingate"" saga was a much talked about episode, leading to a huge audience reaction and prominent coverage across national newspapers and online, including the Mail. 'Newsnight approached Iain Watters directly to secure his first interview about what happened behind the scenes and subsequently since filming which gave our audiences an exclusive slice of the action.' Newsnight has been suffering falling viewing figures and increased criticism about its tone by viewers. Last night it was its feature with a failed Bake Off contestant but last week it was a row about whether it had played into the hands of terrorists when it carried an interview with an Islamic State fanatic. The programme also got into hot water recently following its aborted investigation into Jimmy Savile and false accusations it made against Lord McAlpine, where he was wrongly accused of being a paedophile. It was also ridiculed when Kirsty Wark did Michael Jackson's Thriller routine on Halloween. Argument: Ian Katz said that Kirsty Wark's Thriller last year was not a signal of dumbing down . Former BBC boss Roger Mosey yesterday slammed the flagship current affairs show for trying to chase ratings rather than focus on ‘intelligent viewers’. He believes the show hasn’t recovered from losing Jeremy Paxman’s ‘sense of theatre’, . Writing in the New Statesman, he said: ‘It’s possibly because of the grimness of the news agenda that I find myself ending the day with BBC2’s Newsnight less often than I used to. I admire the energy that Ian Katz has brought to the role of editor, but there’s a sense he could be flogging a dying horse.’ Defence: Under fire editor Ian Katz says the show is more serious than at any time in its recent past . Before leaving Newsnight in June, Paxman, 64, admitted he sometimes felt like telling viewers to ‘go to bed’ because the programme had so little of value to say on slow news days. Since Paxman left, ratings have in fact risen by 17,000, but still lag far behind the audiences it attracted ten years ago. The show has endured a torrid couple of years in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, after it emerged it had investigated the disgraced DJ’s paedophilic past but failed to air its findings before his death. The following year, Newsnight came under further pressure when it wrongly identified former Tory treasurer Lord McAlpine as a paedophile, prompting a £185,000 payout for damages. But Mr Katz has persistently denied he has been dumbing down the show after he took over the BBC's flagship current affairs show. Newsnight has since hit the headlines thanks to Paxman's interview with Russell Brand, Kirsty Wark dancing to Thriller and Emily Maitlis ""interviewing"" Cookie Monster. But Mr Katz told the Radio Times last year: 'Any suggestion of dumbing down is painfully preposterous. Newsnight is more serious than at any time in its recent past. 'The audience is improving from 605,000 in 2013 to routinely more than 700,000 and between 400,000 and 600,000 on Thursday when we compete with Question Time. But we were knocking on a million when Jeremy interviewed Russell Brand. That's a new and exciting way to do politics.' According to Broadcast magazine: 'Newsnight has recorded an average consolidated audience of 590,100 (3.98%) from 2 September 2013 (Katz’s first episode) to 30 April 2014, compared with 623,300 (4.05%) over the same period in 2012/13'.","Viewers slammed decision to feature 'Alaska-gate' baker Iain Watters .

"A supermarket chain has been forced to apologise after a manager suggested an 89-year-old war veteran selling poppies buy a warmer coat because there was not space for him to set up a stall to sell them inside. Bill Daw, 89, was left standing outside the store in Taunton in Somerset on Saturday morning after he claims he was told by a manager: 'you can't come in here, you'll need to stand out there.' The pensioner, who served with the West Kent regiment added: 'I said to him, ""But we've doing been this for years."" I couldn't understand the man.' Veronica Roach, a shopper claimed to have found the pensioner 'freezing' outside the store asked the manager why the elderly man was not selling poppies inside as temperatures dipped to around 14C. Scroll down for video . Bill Daw, 89, was forced to sell his poppies outside the supermarket in Taunton because of space issues . She said once she found the manager he said their current promotion at the doorway meant there was not enough space for a poppy stand as well. Mr Daw said once Morrisons they found out what had happened they were told we could go in the supermarket. Ms Roach argued with the manager and claims he then told her: 'Well, he'll have to wear a warmer coat tomorrow.' In a lengthy post of Facebook, which has since gone viral, Veronica Roach, a former member of the Women's Royal Air Force, described meeting the poppy seller outside the supermarket on Saturday morning. 'I took his hand, which was freezing and asked why he'd set up outside,' she wrote. 'I hunted down the manager and challenged him. He said they had their promotion at the door which meant there was no room for the poppy stand.' The manager allegedly said Mr Daw should 'get a warmer coat tomorrow' to sell poppies outside . Mr Daw is the standard bearer for the Taunton branch of the Burma Star Association. The old soldier, who as a 19-year-old private helped form a guard when the Japanese surrendered in Rangoon, is resilient to adversity. He said: 'We've got over it. It is all sorted out.' The Royal British Legion said its poppy sellers preferred to collect outside the supermarket rather than in the foyer because of a greater footfall. Morrisons said there had been a misunderstanding and the manager did not know that by the afternoon there was a different seller outside the supermarket. The Met Office said temperatures in Taunton on Saturday morning were likely to be between 14C and 15C. 'The British Legion in the morning confirmed they wanted to collect outside,' Morrisons said in a statement. 'However at lunchtime their volunteer changed to an 89-year-old gentleman. This changes everything. 'We can confirm that our manager did not know this and therefore his comment re 'wrap up warm' is then exceptionally inappropriate and he is very saddened by this. 'We at Morrisons are very sorry at how this misunderstanding has looked, we will of course donate to the British Legion, and will be making a special gift to both Veronica and our 89-year-old veteran. 'Veronica is a very welcome regular in the store and is known by lots of the staff and the store manager and this issue has caused concern to all of them. 'We spoke to the British Legion this morning and the store have removed a number of static items in the foyer to enable the British Legion to be inside the store. 'The British Legion and the store are managing this situation together and are both concerned regarding any adverse reaction towards the store. Morrisons has been forced to apologise after the manager of the branch in Taunton, Somerset suggested that an 89-year-old poppy seller buy a warmer coat because there was not space for him to  sell them inside . 'We can confirm that Veronica, The British Legion and Morrisons have worked together to resolve this matter and would ask you to respect their action.' A spokeswoman for the Royal British Legion said collectors had been offered positions inside and outside and had opted for the outside position because of the greater footfall. She said collections would continue there. She added: 'We are grateful to Morrisons, as we are to all commercial outlets, who permit Poppy Appeal collections on their sites throughout the UK and in doing so strengthen our fundraising efforts which ensure the Legion can continue to offer vital support and care to the Armed Forces community.'","Bill Daw, 89 was told to sell poppies outside because there was little space .

Speaking to WTOV9, the young victim’s mother said her boyfriend had met David at work a few months back and befriended him. About three weeks ago, the 64-year-old moved his RV closer to his new friends’ property in Follansbee, West Virginia. Bust: Some 30 officers converged on David's ramshackle shelter situated behind a church . Elaborate setup: The fort came equipped a heater with a propane tank, electricity, a police scanner and knives . Two days later, the child’s mother said David lured her 3-year-old and her sibling with candy and Popsicles into his camper and assaulted the toddler. ‘You are a disgusting specimen of a man you need to turn yourself in and act like a man. Take responsibility for what you did to my baby girl,’ said the child’s grandmother. David David was arraigned Tuesday night in Pennsylvania and is now awaiting extradition back to West Virginia. Authorities are concerned that David may have victimized other children in Pennsylvania and the Ohio Valley.","David David, 64, was captured  in Hanover Township, Pennsylvania .

"The body of a second football fan who was killed in the MH17 disaster has been identified, the Foreign Office has revealed. Newcastle United super fan John Alder, 63, was travelling to New Zealand with his friend Liam Sweeney, 28, to watch their team play pre-season friendlies when the Malaysia Airlines flight was shot down in the Ukraine five weeks ago. The crash claimed the lives of all 298 people on board. The body of Newcastle United supporter John Alder, killed in the MH17 disaster, has  been formally identified, the Foreign Office has revealed . Mr Sweeney's remains were identified and during his funeral service in Newcastle on August 21 his family expressed the wish that Mr Alder's body could also soon be recovered and brought back to the UK.

"A father-to-be who accidentally ran over and killed his pregnant fiancée outside their baby shower just three weeks before the child was due has been jailed. Both the unborn baby girl and Jessica Fenner, 22, died following the crash in Morden, Surrey, earlier this year. Croydon Crown Court heard Daniel Dutfield, 24, who had passed his driving test just a year before, was nearly three times over the legal driving limit when he hit his pregnant partner on July 5 in his turbocharged 1.8l Ford Focus, which had been lowered and a 'racing style' clutch fitted. Dutfield, 24, was nearly three times over the limit when he hit his pregnant partner on July 5 this year . Mark Paltenghi, prosecuting, told the court: 'To celebrate the coming of their baby a baby shower and barbecue was held at the defendant's mother's home. 'The defendant said he had drunk about six or seven pints of strong lager. He says he wasn't a drinker and felt drunk after two pints. 'It's clear that at some point during the afternoon things took a turn for the worse as far as the defendant is concerned.' The court heard a drunken Dutfield had become agitated when members of his family had not shown up to the party. Mr Paltenghi said: 'He said it was 'p***ing him off' how certain people he'd invited hadn't turned up. 'He then walked out of the house, down the driveway and crossed the street to where his Ford was parked and got in. He was worse for wear from the amount he had drunk.' He then 'bombed off' down the road, accelerating up to 60mph around the loop of the quiet estate. Mr Paltenghi said: 'At this point Jessica and her friend discovered the defendant had left. They came out of the house and stood on the street. 'Her friend said she heard the sound of a car engine revving and she saw the defendant's vehicle.' By the time they were taken to hospital their baby girl was dead and Ms Fenner died the following day . An eye witness said he saw the defendant spin the wheel round like someone trying to get the back end to go out, but it was so quick he lost control. Mr Paltenghi said: 'It careered from one side of the street to the other, mounted the pavement and collided with a street sign. The momentum of the car caused Jessica to be knocked down.' He added: 'The insurance company has said that had it known of the vehicle's modifications, particularly, the suspension, they would not have insured him.' Paramedics were called to the scene at 8.08pm and rushed Ms Fenner to hospital, where her child was pronounced dead on arrival. She died the following day. Police called to the scene gave Dutfield a breath test, which revealed he was 93mg over the 35mg legal limit to drive. Dutfield, an apprentice engineer, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving at Croydon Crown Court in September and has now been jailed for four and a half years. Dutfield wept  as the court heard the pair, who had been in a relationship for six years, were 'joined at the hip'. Judge Warwick McKinnon, the Recorder of Croydon, said: 'This is a totally tragic case. Everyone is agreed that this was a freak accident with totally, dreadfully, tragic consequences. 'However you drove drunkenly, aggressively, and at speed, in a residential area. Children could have quite easily been present. 'It's a tragic case, you killed the one you love.' The court heard Dutfield is suffering from depression and had been deemed a suicide risk in custody . Referring to statement from Ms Fenner's mother, Julie Fenner, which was not read out in court, the judge said she spoke 'movingly' about the 'pain, grief, and all-encompassing anguish of losing a daughter, in such tragic, senseless circumstances.' He added: 'This was a wholly avoidable and premature death but no sentence I can pass today, whatever its length can restore the human life that has been so senselessly lost.' Avirup Chaudhuri, defending, said: 'The word tragedy is perhaps over-used these days, but nobody can deny the term is appropriate to this case.' The court heard Dutfield is suffering from depression and had been deemed a suicide risk in custody, though he had helped prevent the suicides of two other inmates while on remand. The court also heard he had no previous convictions and no points on his driving licence . Croydon Crown Court heard the pair, who had been in a relationship for six years, were 'joined at the hip' Dutfield has been jailed for four and a half years after hitting his pregnant fiancée in his car while over the limit . In the months prior to her tragic death Miss Fenner, a shop assistant at hardware store Wilkinson's, told family and friends how excited she was to have moved in with her boyfriend and to start a family. On May 31, the mother-to-be wrote on her Facebook page: 'Had a lovely evening with Dan Dutfield - not long till us 2 become 3 can't wait to meet our beautiful baby girl xx.' She also shared scans of their baby girl and asked for name suggestions. Mr Chaudhuri, said: 'He was hard working, dedicated to his girlfriend and wider family and looking forward to becoming a father. 'Any punishment that this court can give will never compare to the torment he puts himself through on a daily basis.' Dutfield, who appeared in the dock in dark suit and pink shirt, wept as he was sentenced. He was ordered to pay a £120 surcharge and banned from driving for seven years. The public gallery was packed with members of both Dutfield and his dead fiancée's family. Speaking outside Scotland Yard Detective Constable Iain Lister said on behalf of the family: 'The sentence will not bring Jessica back, but we hope it brings some comfort and justice, and that the Fenner family can begin to move on from this tragedy.'","Daniel Dutfield, 24, has been jailed for four and half years following the crash .

"The Army has warned U.S. military personnel that ISIS supporters have been instructed to search social media for their relatives' addresses to 'show up and slaughter them', according to reports. Officials sent out the warning by an intelligence bulletin after the Army Threat Integration Center, which issues early warnings of threats, recognized the potential danger, Fox News reported. The bulletin warns military personnel and their loved ones about ISIS calling supporters to target their homes and suggested they take precautions. 'Given the continued rhetoric being issued by ISIL's media services and supporters through various social media platforms the ARTIC is concerned of the possibility of an attack, it says. Warnings: The U.S. Army has warned military personnel that ISIS could target their families. It comes after U.S. aircraft, such as these F-15E Strike Eagles patrolling over Iraq,  look for ISIS strongholds . 'Soldiers, Government Civilians and Family Members are reminded to be vigilant of their surroundings and report suspicious activities to their respective military or local law enforcement.' It also describes a jihadist tweet instructing supporters to use the 'yellow pages' and social media to identify the addresses of military families, Fox reported. ARTIC explains that the intelligence community has not found 'any corroborative or definitive extremists plots' against U.S. military members, civilians, and their families but that staff still need to be vigilant. 'It provides renewed emphasis on force protection measures to ensure the safety and security of our DOD components, defense critical infrastructure, personnel and communities,' it said in a statement. Militants: ISIS terrorists control vast swaths of territory in northern Syria and western Iraq . Attack: The U.S. military released footage of four deadly air strikes, including that pictured, carried out on ISIS . ISIS, which has shared grisly videos showing the beheadings of American journalists and a British aid worker, has threatened violence against the U.S. following air strikes in Iraq in August and in Syria in September. Supporters have been turning to Twitter to threaten the U.S. and U.S. interests with violence in response. The warning to the U.S. Amy comes after House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers warned that the group is using social media as a 'recruiting tool'. He said some estimates show the terror network is recruiting as many as 3,400 people per month because of their social media recruiting efforts. On Wednesday, Pentagon officials revealed they were finding it difficult determining how effective the airstrikes against ISIS have been because of 'significant gaps in intelligence'.","Army Threat Integration Center has recognized a potential danger, according to an intelligence bulletin sent to military personnel .

"Australian batsman dies aged 25 two days after being hit on the head by a bouncer . Nasser Hussain: Cricket will take stock after Hughes' death, do everything it can, but ultimately it will carry on. It has to... David Lloyd: The Hughes accident is tragic and my heart goes out to Sean Abbott . Paul Newman's obituary . Doctors who treated Phillip Hughes after he was struck on the side of the head by a cricket ball have described the condition he died from as 'incredibly rare' and 'very freakish'. Team doctor Peter Brukner said on Thursday that only a hundred cases of vertebral artery dissection had ever been reported. Hughes died on Thursday aged 25 after being hit on the head by a cricket ball while playing for South Australia in a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Scroll down for video . Phillip Hughes was struck in the neck by a cricket ball which split his artery, his doctors have revealed . 'There's only one previous case ever reported as a result of a cricket ball,' Dr Brukner said. St Vincent's Hospital head of trauma Tony Grabs said he had never encountered the condition before. 'We haven't seen this type of injury at this hospital, it's very rare, very freakish,' Dr Grabs said. The ball hit Hughes on the side of his neck at Sydney Cricket Ground on Tuesday and compressed his verbal artery which carries blood to the brain. It caused the artery to split and led to a 'massive bleed' in the brain, which Dr Brukner said was 'frequently fatal'. Doctors said on Thursday only a hundred cases of vertebral artery dissection had ever been reported . Team doctor Peter Brukner described the condition as 'very freakish' and 'incredibly rare' But Hughes was resuscitated with the help of Cricket New South Wales doctor John Orchid and Newcastle intensive care specialist Tim Stanley. 'They all did an excellent job of keeping Phillip alive and he was able to transported by ambulance to hospital in reasonable condition,' Dr Brukner said. When he arrived at St Vincent's Hospital - in Sydney's inner-city - Hughes was treated by Dr Grabs. 'The head injury he had suffered was catastrophic. He arrived well incubated and been resuscitated very well,' Dr Grabs said. 'Our first priority in this situation was to get a CAT scan of the head to determine what we could do. 'It was early recognised to make an intervention into the brain to help get the pressure down. Hughes was hit by a ball during day one of the Sheffield Shield on Tuesday at Sydney Cricket Ground . The Australian batsman was taken to hospital in Sydney after being hit by a delivery from Sean Abbott . 'If you put a lot of blood around the brain, you will become unconscious.' Once doctors determined there was bleeding on the brain they rushed Hughes into emergency surgery. 'We had extensive surgery to remove part of the skull around his brain to allow the brain to expand so it wasn't compressed,' Dr Grabs said. 'The surgery took about an hour and 20 minutes or so and he was transferred back to the intensive care unit. 'This would be our normal procedure after this we need to induce a coma to rest the patient and rest the brain and look after all the other bodily functions for him. 'Over the period of the first 24 to 48 hours... he did not make very much improvement and unfortunately because of his injury, he died.' The Australian flag was raised at half-mast at the Sydney Cricket Ground after Hughes' death . It was revealed earlier this week Hughes was wearing an 'old helmet' from manufacturer Masuri at the time he was hit. The UK-based manufacturer of the helmet worn by Hughes is one of the leading suppliers of protective headgear to the world's top batsmen. In a statement on Wednesday, Masuri said: 'From the footage and pictures currently available to Masuri, it appears that Phil Hughes was struck by the ball to the rear of the grille and below the back of the shell, missing his Masuri Original Test model helmet. 'This is a vulnerable area of the head and neck that helmets cannot fully protect, while enabling batsmen to have full and proper movement. 'The newly-developed Masuri Vision Series helmet, which supersedes the 2013 helmet worn by Phil Hughes, does afford batsmen extra protection in this region – and still allows comfortable movement.'","Vertebral artery dissection has been described as 'incredibly rare'

"Death: Christopher Briggs, 25, pictured with a friend, was enjoying a break in Ibiza with seven friends . A British tourist died after slipping and banging his head in the bathroom of his Ibiza hotel. Christopher Briggs, 25, of Blackburn, Lancashire, was enjoying a break with seven friends but was found dead hours after returning from a night out in the San Antonio  party resort. The plumber’s parents Stephen and Susan Briggs said that their ‘wonderful’ son - who was staying at the two-star Hostal Apolo - had been looking forward to the break for a year. His father said: ‘He was an easy-going, nice lad. Chris was an optimist too, to the extent that he had got his season ticket for Blackburn Rovers, thinking they were going to do great things. ‘He was really looking forward to the holiday. We worked together for the last time on last Tuesday on a bathroom in Manchester and he was really made up about going away.’ Mr Briggs added that ‘everybody liked’ his son and what happened was ‘just a horrible thing’. The couple said they were receiving help from the British Consulate in Ibiza and expecting their son’s body to be flown home later this week. Mr Briggs said: ‘The police came round to see us on Sunday afternoon. They knocked quite loudly on the door and I just knew. But you never dream of this happening. ‘It is something you never think you will experience. It is devastating losing your son, but I have also lost the person I worked with every day. Nobody would say anything ill of him. ‘He was very, very popular. All our customers loved him. He just enjoyed life.’ On holiday: Mr Briggs had been staying at the two-star Hostal Apolo (file picture) in San Antonio, Ibiza . The former Witton Park High School pupil, who was known as ‘Briggsy’ to friends, had been due to spend a week on the island. His best friend Paul Burke, 24, said the group had gone home early at around 1:30am after a few drinks as they were going to see Swedish DJ Avicii the next night and did not want to be too tired. The Volkswagen Group parts adviser said: ‘I walked back to the room from the West End with Briggsy. We had been to Cafe Mambo to watch the sun set and then we went for a few beers. ‘When we were walking, he seemed fine and we were talking. When we got back, I brushed my teeth and then we went to bed and started chatting about where we were going to watch the Rovers match. ‘Then we fell asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet and Briggsy was still asleep. But when I woke up again at about 8:30am, he was on the floor. ‘I could not wake him and there was blood on his head. I woke the other lads and we ran downstairs to ring the ambulance.’ His friends decided to cut their holiday short and arrived home three days earlier than planned. Discovery: Mr Briggs was found dead hours after returning from a night out in San Antonio (file picture) Mr Burke added: ‘None of us wanted to stay, we just wanted to get home. Everybody is in shock. We are all really close friends. Briggsy got on with everybody and everybody liked him. 'The police came round to see us on Sunday afternoon. They knocked quite loudly on the door and I just knew' Stephen Briggs, father . ‘He loved his football and played five-a-side at the Soccerdome (in Blackburn) three times a week. He was sensible and quiet, but he liked to have a laugh with all his friends. Everybody will miss him so much.’ His school friend Kimberley Hannon said: ‘Chris was like a big brother to me and always looked after me in school. He would do anything for his mates. It is just hard to think he is gone.' A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.’ Blackburn, Hyndburn and Ribble Valley coroner Michael Singleton said he had been made aware of a death in Ibiza. Antonio Montaluo, a spokesman for the Civil Guard in Ibiza, said: ‘We are waiting on autopsy results, but it appears that Christopher Briggs fell in his apartment. He hit his head and died.’","Christopher Briggs of Blackburn was enjoying break with seven friends .

"An 11-year-old girl has had her cupcake business closed down after Illinois health officials said it was breaking regulations. Business had been good for Chloe Stirling, with orders coming in regularly for Hey Cupcake, but a feature in a local newspaper brought the schoolgirl's business to the attention of the authorities. Members of the health department contacted the family and told them Chloe couldn't continue baking unless she had a separate kitchen and permits. Sweet deal: Chloe Stirling set up a business making and selling cupcakes from her parents' kitchen . The ruling has put an end to Chloe's ambitions. The baking fan had started her business so she could save towards a car for her 16th birthday. Illinois State Food Sanitation Code sets out the regulations for making and selling food. Rules include using a kitchen that has met health and safety requirements. For home businesses, this means food must be prepared in a kitchen that isn't also used for domestic cooking. Kitchen equipment and supplies must meet state regulations. The baking area must be inspected regularly and hold a valid permit. Her family had supported her plans, with her grandparents buying a food mixer, her mother Heather promising to match her savings, and her dad Chad eating cakes that didn't work out right. But being able to build a second kitchen in their Troy home was just not possible. 'We’ve already given her a little refrigerator to keep her things in,' Mrs Stirling told the St Louis Post Dispatcher. 'But a separate kitchen? Who can do that?' Health department spokeswoman Amy Yeager said they had no choice but to ask Chloe to close Hey Cupcake. 'The rules are the rules. It’s for the . protection of the public health. The guidelines apply to everyone,' she said. Craft: Chloe, 11, has developed a good reputation for her cakes and her business was featured on the front cover of the Belleville News Democrat at the weekend . Master baker: Chloe with a cake she made for a baby shower . Sharon Valentine, environmental health manager at St Clair County Health Department, added: 'If we let one person do it, how can we tell the person with 30 cats in their home that they can't do it? A line has to be drawn.' The local health department had been tipped off to Chloe's baking business after she appeared on the front page of Belleville News Democrat at the weekend. The feature praised the schoolgirl's skills and revealed how she decided to open Hey Cupcake after taking a cake decorating class with her great aunt at Valentine's Day. Her mother told BND: 'I get nervous when she's making something for somebody [who's paying] because I'm afraid it's not going to work out, but she always makes it come out beautiful.' After getting a taste for baking, Chloe set up her own business two years ago and has been making about $80 a week ever since. She has made cupcakes for birthdays and baby showers, and also donates baked goods to charitable causes. Shut down: The 11-year-old has been forced to close her cupcake business until she gets a license . Chloe's largest order was for 220 cupcakes for a charity event, and when a boy in her school was diagnosed with cancer, she donated cakes with frosting to match his favorite sports team to help raise money for his treatment. While the 11-year-old, who has ambitions of having her own bake shop one day, admitted she was 'bummed that I can't make cakes for a while,' she said she understood the health department's ruling. After people in her hometown heard that Chloe's business had been forced to close, the schoolgirl has had several offers from licensed bakers offering the use of their kitchens.","Chloe Stirling started Hey Cupcake two years ago so she could start saving for a car .

"In App permissions on Android, pictured, Facebook asks to 'Read your text messages (SMS or MMS)' Buried within the latest update for Facebook’s Android app is a feature that is causing growing concern among some users. In the App permissions menu, the site asks for access to 'Read your text messages (SMS and MMS)', and to 'Add or modify calendar events and send email to guests without owners’ knowledge.' The app update began gradually rolling out to users and handsets at the end of last year, and a number of concerned members have complained these new permissions are intrusive and unnecessary. According to Facebook’s official app permission page, an example of when Facebook requires access to text messages is when connecting phone numbers to an account. 'If you add a phone number to your account,' explained Facebook, 'This allows us to confirm your phone number automatically by finding the confirmation code that we send via text message.' The reason the site says it needs to add or modify calendar events is so Facebook events can be seen in the user’s phone’s calendar. Facebook continued: ‘We realise some of these permissions sound scary, so we’d like to provide more info about how we use them. ‘Keep in mind that this list doesn’t include all of the Android permissions we request or all of our uses of those permissions.' For example, confirmation codes are sent via SMS, yet the permissions also grants access to multimedia messages and the reason for this isn't explicitly given. One member complained directly to Facebook support: ‘It's already too much that the app was already apparently collecting people's phone numbers without their permission. I'm sorry, but no, Facebook, you don't get to read my texts.’ Facebook's help pages, pictured, state permission is needed for when users add a phone number to an account. This lets the site confirm the number on an account automatically by scanning text messages for the confirmation code. These codes are sent via SMS, so this doesn't explain the need for access to MMS' Another posted his concerns on Reddit: ‘Facebook gathers this information from pretty much everything you feed them - that's nothing new. The app update began rolling out to users and handsets at the end of last year, but not everyone has seen the latest updates yet . ‘But now they're able to read your text messages. At this point, it's either stick with the old version, get rid of Facebook on Android, or accept that they've got access to every one of your text messages, call log, your personal contact card, the names of whatever other apps you're using.’ Facebook Android engineer Franci Penov responded to this thread and said: ‘We require [access to text messages] so we can automatically intercept login approval SMS messages for people that have turned two-factor authentication on for their accounts, or for phone confirmation messages when you add a phone number to your Facebook account. 'Unfortunately, the Android permissions system does not allow us to specify that we would like to be able to read only SMS messages from a specific number.' 'It's also worth noting that we would love to be able to ask only for the permissions we need for the specific features particular users uses. 'However, Android does not allow permission requests on demand; we have to request all permissions that cover each feature at install time, and the users can only grant or deny all of them and have no control over individual permissions.' Due to the gradual rollout schedule, not everyone will be able to see these new permissions yet. However, users can check their current permissions by clicking Applications Manager in Settings and selecting Facebook. Alternatively they can open the Play Store and find the app under the Installed list.","Facebook began rolling out its Android app update at the end of last year .

"An anonymous U.S. official's . reported description of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a . 'chicken***t', or worthless coward, drew a sharp response on . Wednesday from the Israeli leader – no stranger to acrimony with . the Obama administration – and a slam from America's Republican House Speaker. The American broadside, in an interview in The Atlantic, followed a month of heated exchanges between the . Netanyahu government and Washington over settlement-building in . Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem, which Palestinians seek as the . capital of a future state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The White House soft-pedaled the insult as 'counterproductive' but offered no apology and didn't identify the official involved. 'The thing about Bibi is, he's a chicken***t,' the . unidentified official was quoted as saying, using Netanyahu's . nickname and a slang insult certain to redden the ears of the . U.S.-educated former commando. 'The assault on me comes only because I defend the State of Israel,' Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said after an unnamed Obama administration official called him a 'chicken***t' in a conversation with a reporter . Otherwise occupied: Obama ducked mention of the controversy by spending his day focused on Ebola – meeting with doctors and nurses in an orchestrated photo-op . 'The good thing about Netanyahu is that he's scared to . launch wars,' the official said, alluding to past hints of . possible Israeli military action against Iran's nuclear . program. 'The bad thing about him is that he won't do anything . to reach an accommodation with the Palestinians or with the . Sunni Arab states.' Netanyahu, the official was reported to have said, is . interested only in 'protecting himself from political defeat ... He's got no guts.' Israeli leaders usually do not respond to comments by . unidentified officials. But Netanyahu addressed those remarks . directly in opening a memorial ceremony in parliament for an . Israeli cabinet minister assassinated by a Palestinian in 2001. 'I am not prepared to make concessions that will endanger our state,' Netanyahu said. 'Understand, our national interests, topped by security and the unity of Jerusalem, are not what top the interests of those anonymous forces attacking us, and me personally.' 'I am under attack simply because I am defending the State of Israel. If I didn't stand firm on our national interests, I would not be under attack.' 'Our supreme interests, chiefly the security and unity of . Jerusalem, are not the main concern of those anonymous officials . who attack us and me personally, as the assault on me comes only . because I defend the State of Israel,' the Israeli prime minister added. 'Despite all of the attacks I suffer, I will continue to . defend our country. I will continue to defend the citizens of . Israel,' he said. Such pledges by Netanyahu have resonated among Israeli . voters, even amid fears his strained relations with U.S. President Barack Obama could ultimately weaken support from . Israel's main diplomatic ally and arms provider. After Netanyahu's speech, Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for . the White House National Security Council, dismissed the . purported slur, denying that it reflected how the Obama . administration felt about the Israeli leader. 'Certainly that's not the administration's view, and we . think such comments are inappropriate and counterproductive.' The same word – 'counterproductive – was on White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest's crib sheet during a Wednesday briefing with reporters. 'Those comments do not reflect the United States' position, and they do not reflect the personal views of the President of the United States,' Earnest said. 'I am not aware of who made those comments .... I am not aware if the president knows who made those comments. I'd be surprised if he did.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the president doesn't know who called the Israeli prime minister a vulgar name, but that it was 'counterproductive' Confronted with harsh criticism from John Boehner, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Earnest called it 'a little rich to have a lecture about profanity from the Speaker of the House.' Referring to the epithet 'chicken***t,' he claimed that Boehner has 'reportedly said that about the majority leader of the United States Senate,' Democrat Harry Reid of Nevada. The speaker had hours earlier called it a 'failure' of Obama's leadership that 'disrespectful rhetoric' has been 'used time and again by this administration with respect to the special relationship the United States has with the state of Israel.' 'When the president discusses Israel and Iran, it is sometimes hard to tell who he thinks is America’s friend and who he thinks is America’s enemy,' Boehner said in a statement. 'The House of Representatives has no trouble drawing that distinction.' 'Over the last several months, I have watched the administration insult ally after ally. I am tired of the administration’s apology tour. The president sets the tone for his administration. He either condones the profanity and disrespect used by the most senior members of his administration, or he does not.' Boehner's statement referred specifically to the use of vulgar language as a slam against a head of state, not the use of foul language in general. Some Israeli pundits predict an Israeli election in 2015, . two years early, speculation seemingly supported by increasingly . vocal challenges to his policies from senior ministers to the . left and right of him within the coalition government. Economy Minister Naftali Bennett, whose ultranationalist . Jewish Home party belongs to the coalition but who has had testy . relations with Netanyahu, defended him on Wednesday. 'The prime minister of Israel is not a private person. He is . the leader of the Jewish state and the entire Jewish people. Cursing the prime minister and calling him names is an insult . not just to him but to the millions of Israeli citizens and Jews . across the globe,' he wrote on Faceboook. Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog sounded a more . critical note, telling Channel Two television: 'Netanyahu is . acting like a political pyromaniac, and he has brought our . relations with the United States to an unprecedented low.' In a series of recent speeches widely seen in Israel as . setting the stage for a possible poll, Netanyahu has highlighted . growing security concerns in the wake of the July-August war . with Hamas in Gaza and regional unrest that has brought Islamist . militants to Israel's northern border with Syria. Israel also worries that U.S.-led world powers will agree to . what it deems insufficient curbs on the nuclear programme of its . arch-foe, Iran, in talks with a looming Nov 24 deadline. Fears of a possible new Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, . have been stoked in Israel by now-daily rock-throwing by . Palestinians in Jerusalem amid Muslim fears of an end to an . Israeli de facto ban on Jewish worship at the al-Aqsa mosque . compound in the holy city where Biblical temples once stood. Netanyahu has pledged to preserve the 'status quo' at the . site, a commitment Palestinian leaders view with suspicion. But drawing Palestinian outrage and a State Department . accusation that Israel was distancing peace, Netanyahu pledged . on Monday to fast-track plans for 1,000 new settler homes in . Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem. Netanyahu described such criticism as being 'detached from . reality', saying Jews had a right to live anywhere in Jerusalem, . regarded by Israel as its united capital - a claim not . internationally recognised. Baskey, the U.S. spokesman, acknowledged longstanding policy . differences between Israel and Washington over settlements. 'Obviously, despite the extremely close relationship between the . U.S. and Israel, we do not agree on every issue,' he said. 'For instance we have repeatedly made clear the United . States' longstanding view that settlement activity is . illegitimate and complicates efforts to achieve a two-state . solution.' Despite these differences 'the U.S.-Israel . relationship remains as strong as ever', Baskey added. Most countries and the World Court deem the settlements . Israel has built in areas captured in a 1967 war to be illegal. Israel disputes this, and has settled 500,000 Jews in East . Jerusalem and the West Bank, among 2.4 million Palestinians.

"An elderly woman who has admitted to killing her husband 28 years ago and she has only been sentenced to spend six months in jail. Carolyn Sue Krizan-Wilson entered a guilty plea in the unsolved mystery of who killed her husband Roy McCaleb on September 20, 1985. McCaleb's children are happy with her guilty plea and feel that her light sentence- of only six months behind bars and 10 years probation- is sufficient. Admitting her guilt: Carolyn Krizan-Wilson, 71, entered a guilty plea 28 years after killing her husband . Cold case: After believing Krizan-Wilson's story about a mystery barefoot rapist who attacked her and then killed her husband Roy McCaleb (right), police let the trail run cold (she was arrested in 2008, pictured) 'She is willingly admitting that she murdered him and that's something we've known all these years,' McCaleb's daughter Pam Nalley told The Houston Chronicle. 'I think that means more to me than anything.' Krizan-Wilson was 43 at the time of the murder had been married to 50-year-old McCaleb for two years when she killed him. For decades, investigators believed the story she told them about how her husband ended up shot to death by a mysterious barefoot man. Krizan-Wilson told the police that more than a week before her husband's death she was carjacked and raped by an unknown man. McCaleb, a construction foreman, had just had back surgery and she said that she never reported the fictitious carjacking because she feared that it would cause her husband to have a slower recovery. Tragic: The victim's daughter Pamela Nalley said that she was satisfied by the six-month sentence with 10 years probation, saying that she just wanted to hear Krizan-Wilson admit to her crime . Sad closure: McCaleb's sister Linda Petty got emotional in the Houston court on Wednesday . Then, she claimed, on the night of September 22, that same knife-wielding barefoot attacker broke into the couple's home through an unlocked door. The Houston Chronicle tells how she added specific details to the alleged break in: the man scraped her with a coat hanger and poured hot wax on her before threatening her with a knife and raping her like he reportedly had 10 days prior. Krizan-Wilson, who is now 71, added that after the rape, the man took the gun that she kept underneath her pillow and shot her husband while he slept. One key addition is that she said she bumped into the man as he was running out, causing him to drop the gun. Connected: When she was originally arrested in 2008, Krizan-Wilson was working as a civilian employee at the Houston Police department where her two sons (not pictured) were officers . She allegedly picked it up and fired two shots at him, an important detail as it would have explained the reason why any of her fingerprints and gun residue would be found after the shooting. The case ran cold when they could not find any suspects, but it was reopened in 2008 and Krizan-Wilson was not indicted because of the amount of time that had passed since the crime. By 2008, she was working as a civilian employee of the Houston Police Department and her two sons were police officers. It is not know if McCaleb was either of their fathers. Over the past five years, the case has been in and out of appeal hearings, and on Wednesday she was finally sentenced. Her half-year in jail will begin in late December. Her lawyer told The Chronicle that she is suffering from dementia.","Carolyn Krizan-Wilson admitted to killing her husband Roy McCaleb while he slept in their Texas home in 1985 .

"Cough medicines are waste of money, doctors declared today. Both NHS bosses and leading GPs have dismissed the products - and say traditional home made remedies with lemon or honey to be the best approach. Cough medicines, which usually cost between £3 and £5 for a small bottle, are part of an over-the-counter healthcare industry worth £3 billion a year. There is little evidence that expensive over-the-counter cough medicines actually work, doctors said today . But the NHS Choices website advises: 'There's little evidence to suggest cough medicines actually work, although some ingredients may help treat symptoms associated with a cough, such as a blocked nose or fever.' The webpage adds that the 'simplest and cheapest' treatment for a 'short-term cough' may be a homemade remedy containing lemon and honey. It continues: 'There's no quick way of getting rid of a cough caused by a viral infection. It will usually clear up after your immune system has fought off the virus.' Dr Tim Ballard, vice chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, today backed up the NHS claim. He said: 'The medical evidence behind cough medicines is weak and there is no evidence to say that they will reduce the duration of illnesses - as such, GPs are unlikely to prescribe them.' A Which? investigation two years ago said found many popular cough medicines do not work as well as they claim to. The report authors concluded that studies used to support the claims of effectiveness are often low quality. Many also contain high doses of sugar, with one week of the adult maximum dose of a popular product containing as much sugar as five Mars bars. A bottle of Dry Coughs remedy by leading brand Benylin is sold in Boots for £4.99 for a 150ml bottle. Benylin's website states: 'Through its active ingredients, Benylin Dry Coughs Original helps to suppress the coughing mechanism, reducing the urge to cough.' Doctors say traditional home made remedies made with lemon and honey may be the best approach . The Proprietary Association of Great Britain, a national trade association representing the consumer healthcare industry, released a statement after Benylin was contacted for a comment. It said: 'Cough medicines will not ""cure"" a cough, but they can help relieve the symptoms. 'The key to effective management of cough is to identify the most troublesome symptom and to choose an appropriate product. 'All cough medicines have been assessed for safety and efficacy by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) before they are put on the market. 'When the product is licensed, MHRA also reviews the claims that can be made about the product, such as what the product can be used to treat, how fast the product works and how long it works for. 'Only claims approved by MHRA can be used on the packaging and in advertising. The NHS Choices website advises that if the cough is caused by an underlying treatment, this will need treating . 'OTC products on the UK market have successfully demonstrated their efficacy through decades of use by millions of consumers, and their acceptance by the MHRA, which independently reviews the clinical evidence, means people can continue to rely on them when treating themselves and their children.' Dr Ballard said while some patients do find such medicines beneficial, patients who have had a cough for less than three weeks should seek advice from their local pharmacist. He added: 'If the cough lasts longer and is affecting young infants, or is associated with coughing up blood, shortness of breath, confusion, or high fever, then they should contact their GP practice, although a face-to-face appointment might not be necessary.' The NHS website states that coughs caused by an underlying medical condition will need specific treatment.","Cough medicines are part of industry worth £3 billion a year .

"A gang of Asian men who groomed vulnerable white girls for sex has been jailed for more than 50 years. Police say up to 100 girls could have fallen victim to the gang led by brothers Ahdel Ali, 25, and Mubarek Ali, 29, of Wellington, Shropshire. Over a three-year period between 2006 and 2009, the men targeted schoolgirls to control as child prostitutes by giving them alcohol, food and money. The Ali brothers were found guilty of numerous offences against four girls aged from 13 to 17, including rape, sexual activity with a child, inciting and controlling child prostitution and trafficking children for sex. Both married and of Pakistani heritage, they had described their victims as worthless ‘whores’, ‘slags’ and ‘sluts’. Jailed: Mubarek Ali, 29, left, and Ahdel Ali, 24, right, have been jailed for 14 and 18 years respectively for pimping out teenage girls to curry house workers for £150 sex sessions . As the major police operation came to a . close today, police praised the victims, aged 13 to 16, for giving . evidence at a series of court hearings, including an original trial . which collapsed at Stafford Crown Court in September 2011. During . the Ali brothers’ trial, Stafford Crown Court heard the pair groomed . two girls, aged 15 and 16, for sex before persuading them to work as . prostitutes for them in 2008. The . pair were found guilty a total of 24 offences, . including controlling child prostitution, people trafficking and sexual . exploitation. Ahdel Ali, was sentenced to 18 years in prison, while . his older brother was given a 14-year jail term at Worcester Crown Court . last October. Five other men . from the Telford area pleaded guilty to charges they faced prior to the . start of their trials and were jailed for between two-and-a-half and . seven years. Police work: The Ali brother's sentencing at Worcester Crown Court were only part of a large criminal operation carried out by West Mercia Police to break up the child prostitution ring which saw five other men convicted . The convictions of the seven men at separate hearings have previously been reported separately, but could not be officially linked together until today’s final court hearing. 'Operation Chalice' has been one of the largest investigations in West Mercia Police history, with a team of up to 50 officers working on the inquiry to bring the men to justice. Speaking after today's final court hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Neil Jamieson said the teenage victims were targeted because of their vulnerability. Mr Jamieson said: ‘We are pleased with the convictions we have achieved as a result of this operation - an operation that is among the most complex West Mercia Police has ever undertaken. ‘After years of being exploited the girls then went through a huge amount during the course of this investigation, and the trials themselves were then a real ordeal for those that gave evidence.’ The officer added: ‘I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the strength and character shown by all of the victims who came and gave evidence and also thank their families for the support they have shown during what has been a truly horrible time. ‘It has been very challenging for these young women to come forward and give their evidence and I hope that these convictions will go some way to help them move on with their future lives.’","'Operation Chalice' inquiry into child prostitution in Shropshire closed today .

"She's famous for her love of fashion but it seems Spain's Queen Letizia isn't above wearing the same ensemble twice. The Spanish royal was glamorous in a windowpane check top by Hugo Boss, last worn for Spanish Red Cross Day last month, as she welcomed charity campaigners to the Zarzuela Palace today. Letizia, 42, met dignitaries from the 'One Toy, One Dream' initiative which raises funds to buy toys to send to impoverished children living in the Third World. Favourite: Queen Letizia was last seen in the glamorous top on Spanish Red Cross Day last month . Support: The royal was meeting organisers of the One Toy, One Dream campaign at the Zarzuela Palace . The royal has long been a supporter of the campaign, which is now in its 15th year, and sends more than 500,000 toys to Iraq, Ethiopia, Morocco, Senegal and Peru - among many others - each year. Run by the Grow Up Playing Foundation, the campaign has also established 1,400 'toy libraries' around the world, each of which contains up to 400 toys that can be enjoyed by children aged two or above. The charity meeting came at the start of yet another busy week for Letizia and hot on the heels of an action-packed seven days that saw the Spanish royals welcome Chile's President Michelle Bachelet to Madrid. Letizia also visited Vienna, where, along with making a speech in English and German, she launched a new exhibition dedicated to Spanish artist Diego Velázquez. Important work: The campaign sends 500,000 toys to children in 22 different countries each year . Warm welcome: The organisers enjoyed an audience with the Spanish queen, 42, in Madrid . Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum. The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe. Las Meninas also has an Austrian connection as Infanta Margarita went on to become the Holy Roman Empress and wife of Leopold I who oversaw the running of his lands from the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. Busy: The engagement came hot on the heels of a busy seven days for Queen Letizia and her husband . Glittering: Last week, Letizia and Felipe welcomed Chile's Michelle Bachelet to Madrid . Striking: For the state dinner last week, Letizia was striking in an elegant black lace gown . It was also at the Hofburg that Margarita died in 1673 aged just 21, although not before she gave her husband four children, all of whom - Maria Antonia, Electress of Bavaria notwithstanding - died in childhood. Despite the tragic story behind Las Meninas, it remains one of Velázquez' most famous paintings, if not the only one he did of Infanta Margarita. Letizia, although not famous for her love of art, has made supporting her native culture a key part of her role, and, along with King Felipe, is a patron of the Real Academia Española - the official royal institution charged with overseeing the Spanish language. Warm welcome: The Spanish queen was pared back in grey for the formal welcome at the El Pardo Palace . Talent: Letizia also made a speech - in English and German - to art lovers in Vienna last Monday .","The Spanish Queen, 42, met campaigners from One Toy, One Dream .

"Lurid allegations of sexual harassment, drinking sessions and abuse of power in the House of Commons cast a new shadow over the reputation of MPs last night. Dozens of young political aides have claimed to be on the receiving end of unwanted advances from older men. A small group of MPs is said to have regularly become drunk and made passes at male researchers in particular. The Pavilion buffet, a tented restaurant for MPs on the terrace of the House of Commons (file picture) The toxic claims were made last night by Channel 4 News in an investigation named The Palace of Sexminster. One woman researcher told the investigation: ‘I watched men coming on to men, and men hiring men that they wanted to sleep with. I saw male MPs and researchers having relationships. ‘When I was there, older men would explore their sexuality and be predatory to younger men.’ The claims came at the end of a week when the Maria Miller expenses affair has again called into question the integrity of MPs. Last night, as the allegations emerged, the Tories announced they were implementing a new code of conduct and a grievance procedure for MPs and their office staff. It acts as a ‘basic statement of what should be best practice in the workplace for Conservative Members and their staff’, a spokesman said. Commons Speaker John Bercow has also set up a helpline for staff of MPs from all parties. A small group of MPs is said to have regularly become drunk and made passes at male researchers in particular . The Channel 4 investigation was screened last night to coincide with the end of the trial of Nigel Evans. The former Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons was cleared of all nine charges of rape and sexual assault, but Preston Crown Court heard about a boozy Westminster culture often involving younger members of staff. In the investigation by Firecrest Films, a third of 70 researchers from all political parties with different sexual orientations said they had been subject to harassment. Lord Rennard was accused of making unwelcome advances to women party activists . Nearly a quarter said that they had witnessed someone else being sexually harassed, or that a friend had confided in them. One said: ‘At an event for young political activists I was asked to go to the gents by a certain MP who had always been a nice guy. I just brushed it off. ‘The MP suggested I go to the toilets with him at about 1am, but then at 3am I saw him going back to his hotel room with a guy who looked about 18.’ Another said: ‘He invited the office to a gay bar, and came up to me and put his arm around my shoulder. Then one time he slid his hand right down my back, and I moved it away.’ The investigation revealed that young men are more likely to get harassed than women. Some 40 per cent of men spoken to said they had received unwanted sexual advances. Westminster’s sexual harassment culture came under intense scrutiny last year after the Lord Rennard affair. The senior Liberal Democrat was accused of making unwelcome advances to women party activists. The row led to a police inquiry and an internal probe into how the party treats women – which remains unresolved. Last night gay rights campaigner Ben Summerskill said: ‘Sexual harassment is part of the culture of Westminster. In the last decade I’ve heard of dozens of cases from men and women. ‘People are vulnerable as they’re often political obsessives and have never worked anywhere else. ‘For both sexes the MP can say that if they oblige them, it might help their career enormously. ‘There’s no HR [human resources], no structure for people management or supervision.’ Mr Bercow said that Parliament was an ‘extraordinary place in which to work’ and that the Commons  ‘strives to be an exemplar of good employment practice’. ‘I am pleased that a helpline for staff is going to be established, as a safety net designed to complement existing pastoral care,’ he added. Channel 4 News claimed one Conservative MP recently expressed the view that those who believe themselves to be victims of unwanted sexual advances should toughen up – or as the MP put it: ‘Grow a pair.’","Dozens of young political aides had 'unwanted advances from older men'

"Sheffield United's match-winner Marc McNulty had to pinch himself after his goal earned victory over Southampton and a place in the Capital One Cup semi-final. The 22-year-old bundled home from close range in the 63rd minute to earn a second Premier League scalp of the season for the League One Blades, who reached the last four of this competition for the first time since 2002/03. It is a remarkable story for McNulty, who was playing semi-professional football with Scottish Championship side Livingston until the summer when Nigel Clough came calling. Marc McNulty celebrates after Sheffield United's 1-0 victory over Southampton in the Capital One Cup . McNulty (second right) bundles in what proved to be Sheffield United's winner in the Bramall Lane match . Sheffield United players celebrate after McNulty's close-range goal split the teams in the quarter-final . The winner, which settled a one-sided tie where Southampton were out-played and out-fought, was his eighth goal of the season and McNulty admits he is living the dream. 'I still need to pinch myself sometimes,' he said. 'Twenty-odd thousand people here singing my name and scoring goals against Premier League teams in the cup is just a dream come true. 'It's the stuff you dream of as a boy and it came true. 'It's brilliant, it's hard to describe nights like that, the fans made it extra special and to get the winner was just unbelievable. 'The boys were confident before the game. We didn't expect to come out with a flukey win, we came out with game plan to get in their face and the boys believed we could get something out of the game and I think that showed. 'This win could give massive confidence to the boys, Southampton have been flying in the Premier League and we can take great belief from results like that.' Nigel Clough's Blades are into the semi-finals of a major Cup competition for the second successive year . United reached the semi-finals of last season's FA Cup but were beaten 5-3 by Hull City at Wembley . The victory, which would have been far more resounding had Saints goalkeeper Fraser Forster not made a string of fine saves, continues the Blades' superb cup run over the last 12 months. Having knocked two top-flight teams out of the FA Cup last season to reach the semi-final, they have sent two more packing in the League Cup and sit two games away from a return to Wembley. With McNulty not at the club for that impressive cup run last year, he is keen to experience it for himself. 'I obviously missed out on it last year, I was good friends with some of the lads in the team so I watched all the games last year and I was a bit jealous of not being on the pitch,' he added. 'That was great for the players and the fans last year but hopefully we can do it again this year.'","Sheffield United beat Southampton 1-0 in League Cup quarter-finals .

"David Cameron is to set out his ‘red lines’ for a renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU - with senior ministers pushing for an ‘emergency brake’ on immigration from the Continent. The Prime Minister told MPs yesterday that he plans to set out ‘all those issues’ that will form the basis of Britain’s demands ‘in the months ahead’. As the Daily Mail revealed earlier this month, a system that would allow the UK to impose a block on incomers from particular countries if numbers become too big is being backed by key Conservative figures. Scroll down for video . Red lines: Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs yesterday that he plans to set out 'all those issues' that will form the basis of Britain’s demands 'in the months ahead' At Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron’s former leadership rival David Davis noted that ‘the Conservative Party and only the Conservative Party will deliver a referendum and a renegotiation on Europe’. He added: ‘Will the Prime Minister tell us his intentions as bringing to this House the red line issues that will feature in his renegotiation and can he give us a preview of some of those issues today?’ Mr Cameron said Britain’s demands would include ‘safeguards for the single market, the ability to block new regulation, making sure Britain comes out of ever closer union, and crucially as I said in my conference speech, we have to address the issues of immigration’. ‘I am looking forward to addressing all of those issues in the months ahead,’ the Prime Minister added. Prime Minister's Questions: Mr Cameron said Britain's demands would include 'safeguards for the single market', the 'ability to block new regulation' and 'making sure Britain comes out of ever closer union' Conservative ministers want fundamental reform of the EU’s founding principle of free movement, which allows people to move between countries, Government sources say. They are proposing new rules to apply to all new member states ensuring that their economies must reach a certain level before free movement of their citizens is allowed. The change would be designed to eliminate the overwhelming economic pull for people to move from poor countries to richer ones. Britain is also expected to propose an ‘emergency brake’ on an influx from EU states that could be applied if numbers exceeded expectations. The idea would be a central demand of Mr Cameron’s plan to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU if he wins next year’s general election before holding an in/out referendum in 2017. The system would allow the UK, or other countries seeing a large number of incomers from other member states, to bar any further arrivals for a fixed period. Tory pledge: Mr Cameron’s former leadership rival David Davis (pictured) noted that 'the Conservative Party and only the Conservative Party will deliver a referendum and a renegotiation on Europe' Ed Miliband is facing a growing rebellion from his own party over his refusal to offer an EU referendum, it emerged yesterday. Thirty-four Labour MPs have now declared publicly that they disagree with their leader’s stance on an in/out vote on Britain’s place in Europe. They include Labour’s policy chief Jon Cruddas, shadow education minister Steve McCabe, and two former Labour government ministers, Keith Vaz and Andrew Smith. Meanwhile yesterday it emerged that Ed Balls, the shadow Chancellor, has suggested Labour should back the Conservatives in proposing reform of EU free movement rules. Mr Balls agreed there could no longer be a ‘free-for-all’ in terms of the migration of workers within the EU. It would be used to prevent a repeat of what happened in 2004, when Labour opted not to impose transitional controls on EU migrants from the so-called A8 countries, including Poland, which joined the EU. Tory ministers are understood to be prepared to use Britain’s veto to prevent any further expansion of the EU bloc unless free movement is reformed. At least seven more countries, including Turkey, have suggested they want to join the EU. Home Secretary Theresa May, speaking at a fringe event at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham last month, said of the Tories’ proposed EU renegotiation, she said: ‘Free movement is an area where there needs to be change in the future.’ Mrs May defended the Government’s record on reducing immigration so far. ‘Where we can control immigration, we have been. ‘Net migration from outside the European Union is down to the levels of the 1990s, but of course, European free movement rules mean that we are not able to exercise as much control in that area, and we have seen increases in the number of people coming to the UK from the European Union. ‘Partly of course that’s a function of our economy growing more strongly than others in Europe so that’s an attraction for people to come and look for work. It’s important we constantly challenge ourselves to ensure we are doing everything we can on the immigration system.’","Ministers push for 'emergency brake' on immigration from Continent .

"Aeran Brent is tired of visitors asking about her store's name or snapping pictures of the sign outside. Unfortunately, that's life for a small business owner whose shop — Isis Bridal and Formal — shares a name with ISIS, the acronym of a notorious Islamic militant group that the United States is fighting in Iraq and Syria. 'I'm just like, ""Come on!""' she says. 'I get what's going on, but can you see it's a store?' Unfortunate: Businesses' reactions range from horror to indifference at the association that's being made between the Islamic State terror group and their names, which are often references to the Egyptian goddess . Brent denies any connection with the other ISIS, which stands for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, and says she wants to rename her store. 'Isis' is part of more than 270 product, service or business names among active federal trademarks, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. But businesses are not required to register their names, so it is difficult to say how many companies use 'Isis,' which is also the name of an Egyptian and pagan goddess. For those companies, the 'Isis' name can be damaging. Branding experts say an unfortunate association with a name can scar a company's reputation even if the connection is coincidental. That's the case for Isis Collections Inc, a New Jersey company that makes weaves, wigs and hair pieces. CEO Phillip Shin says stores have told him that customers will put his company's products back on the shelf after noticing the Isis label. Daring: Ann Summers apologized for a line of lingerie named 'Isis,' but said it had no plans to drop the offering of bras, thongs and a babydoll . Threat: The terror group now calling itself the 'Islamic State' has declared its aim of establishing a caliphate over the Middle East, Africa and parts of Europe . In the United Kingdom, he's heard that competitors have joked at trade shows about his business being tied to terrorists. 'It's so stressful,' Shin says, noting that he has spent 20 years building the company's reputation. 'I've lost all the benefit of the brand image.' Shin, who named his company after the Egyptian goddess, started removing the Isis label from some packages. But he's reluctant to give up on such an established brand. He says he wishes the U.S. and European media would stop referring to the militant group as ISIS. Isis Collections has had no sales problems in South Korea, where the media only refers to the group as the Islamic State. Another company, technology startup Isis Wallet, announced in September that it would change its name to Softcard. The joint venture involving AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless launched late last year with an app that allows people to use their smartphones while checking out at a store to get discounts and use credit or loyalty cards. By June, company leaders were thinking about rebranding to avoid confusion with the militant group, which had taken over large swaths of Iraq and filmed beheadings of aid workers and journalists. 'However coincidental, we have no desire to share a name with this group, and our hearts go out to those affected by this violence,' CEO Michael Abbott said in a blog post announcing the new name. Softcard partners with major companies like American Express and executives were worried about asking those partners to continue promoting a product named Isis. 'We didn't want to put anybody in a bad situation,' says Cie Nicholson, senior vice president of marketing. Changing a brand or an established company name can be a costly and complex move. Just finding a memorable name can be hard because the best ideas are often taken or trademarked, says Allen Adamson, managing director of the branding firm Landor Associates. 'It's not just have a pizza lunch and quickly come up with an alternative,' he says. Softcard's name change makes sense to Joseph Lewis, a partner with the law firm of Barnes & Thornburg who specializes in trademarks. He noted that the company is new and still building its image. With the old name, they would have had to take the extra step of explaining that they weren't tied to the Islamic State group. 'Brands are owned by companies, but it's all in the public's mind and you can only control so much,' he says. More established brands that don't deal directly with consumers may not take as much of a hit. Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc has no plans to change a brand it has built over 25 years. The California company partners with other companies to sell drugs it has developed. It doesn't sell products directly to consumers, and its name doesn't even appear on any of the products it helped develop. The company, which received funding from the ALS Association, benefactors of the viral Ice Bucket Challenge, says only a few investors have asked company officials about the name. 'We've been around for a while,' says D. Wade Walke, vice president of corporate communications. 'They can easily distinguish between us and a Middle Eastern terrorist group.'","Companies and brands named 'Isis' are reporting reluctance among customers to buy their products .
Lingerie designer Ann Summers apologized for their Isis line of bras, thongs and a cami suspender, but had no plans to drop it from their site .

"Reverend Al Sharpton has blasted his former attorney collaborator in the wake of accusations he raped an adviser to Sharpton's National Action Network. Sharpton's highly visible move Tuesday to distance himself from Sanford Rubenstein came a day after police combed the 70-year-old civil rights attorney's apartment for evidence that could paint a picture of what happened in the hours after Sharpton's birthday bash Saturday. Among the potential evidence hauled from Rubenstein's Upper East penthouse on Monday were two bloody condoms and a sex toy. Accused: A file photo shows civil rights power attorney Sanford Rubenstein, who's been accused of raping another trusted ally of Al Sharpton after the reverend's 60th birthday bash on Saturday . Search and seizure: Detectives carried away several bags of evidence from Rubenstein's penthouse apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The evidence reportedly included bloody condoms found near Rubenstein's bed and a sex toy . 'Even if it was consensual, why would he take a key leader of our organization back to his apartment right after a fund-raiser,' outraged Sharpton asked the Daily News. 'It's disrespectful to our movement, and the women in our network are absolutely outraged.' Sharpton told the News that Rubenstein, who's stood with the reverend at events dating back to 1997, 'has no future' at the National Action Network. Kenneth Montgomery, one of the accuser's lawyers, told the News: 'She’s fighting to keep her life together, keep her dignity, and not fall apart.' Neighbors and friends, meanwhile, detailed Rubenstein's seedy lifestyle of frequenting strip clubs and using his limousine to pick up much younger women, according to the New York Post. Sanford Rubenstein maintains that he had consensual sex with the 42-year-old retail executive whom he took home after the civil rights leader's birthday party at the Four Seasons last Wednesday. He has not been charged with a crime. However, the woman has told NYPD detectives that Rubenstein took advantage of her when she was passed out drunk and incapable of telling him no. Rubenstein's lawyer Benjamin Brafman issued a statement to MailOnline refusing to comment on the Post's claims, 'even those I know to be patently false.' He also reiterated an earlier assertion that Rubenstein will be cleared by the police investigation and that he did not commit a crime. NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan on Tuesday and reportedly collected 'biological evidence,' according to the Post. Rubenstein lives in the $7million penthouse apartment at the top of this East 63rd Street highrise on the Upper East Side . Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy. The Post, quoting 'sources close to Rubenstein,' alleges a tawdry personal life that revolved around the constant pursuit of sex. One source told the newspaper: 'The guy’s hung like a cashew.' Another said: 'Every time I see him, he wants to tell me about his latest ménage à trois. It’s all about sex with this guy.' Neighbors say they often seen the septuagenarian lawyer with young women 'barely out of their teens,' according to the Post. One source says the Rubenstein is a regular at strip clubs. He reportedly spent to much time at high-end club Scores that all the strippers greeted him by name when he came in. He also reportedly paid an artist to paint a series of canvasses depicting the club - including a scene showing him getting a rub-down, the Post claims. Sanford Rubenstein (left), seen here at a 2005 party in Miami, is accused of raping a 42-year-old woman. The woman pictured here is not his accuser . He currently haunts at a strip club in Hell's Kitchen that features muscled, tattooed strippers who are black or Hispanic and prefers women who are 5-foot-11 or taller, the Post claims. Meanwhile, attorneys representing the alleged victim  said Monday they have 'devastating' information about the alleged crime. Sources familiar with the case have claimed that the 42-year-old woman, who works for Sharpton’s National Action Network, went home with the 70-year-old attorney willingly last week, and even had sex with him a second time the following morning. But attorney Keith White who represents the alleged victim has challenged these assertions, insisting that a crime had been committed. ‘There’s a lot of new information that will be devastating to Mr. Rubenstein,’ White told New York Daily News. ‘We want to give the district attorney a chance to take this information and do the right thing.‘ . White's partner, Kenneth Montgomery, accused Rubenstein and his legal team headed by Benjamin Brafman of trying to 'demonize' his client. Describing the 42-year-old as a mother and a pillar of the community, Montgomery said her 'world has been turned upside down.' Investigators suspect Rubenstein may have used an object to penetrate the 42-year-old woman during the alleged attack in his $7million Manhattan penthouse, making her bleed, sources told the New York Daily News. The anonymous accusation, which emerged Sunday, is at odds with the source close to Rubenstein, who said the alleged attack that night was in fact consensual, and that more sex followed in the morning. The claims came as investigators spent hours searching Rubenstein's apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side for evidence. On Monday afternoon, police removed a dozen evidence bags, among them one marked 'biological evidence.' They also carried a mattress out of Rubenstein's apartment. Close: The Rev Al Sharpton, center with Rubenstein to the left, has said there is no place for the alleged behavior - but avoided jumping to the conclusion that he is guilty . As part of the investigation, police reportedly set up a call between the alleged victim and Rubenstein, during which the woman asked the 70-year-old attorney, 'What happened last night?' The lawyer replied that they had sex but did not incriminate himself, a police source told the paper. He has not been charged with anything, though law enforcement  sources suggested to the paper that are considering a third-degree rape charge, which means the victim was incapable of consent. Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. Sharpton also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations today, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' Although he avoided choosing one side over the other, Sharpton said there is 'no place' for the alleged behavior, the New York Post reported. He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn’t mean you’re guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain’t no place for that in our community.' Rubenstein and his alleged victim were both at Sharpton's lavish 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant before they went home together, along with a third person, who later left. Other guests at the bash included New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee. A police source described the case as 'a classic he said, she said'. Law enforcement sources also described how Rubenstein was allegedly called by the victim, with police listening in, in an attempt to trick him into describing the encounter. Defense: Benjamin Brafman has been taken on as Rubenstein's attorney. Above he denies all allegations to waiting reporters . But, the source said, the call passed without incident and Rubenstein simply said that they two of them had sex. Rubenstein hit back at the claims Monday through a lawyer of his own - top New York attorney Benjamin Brafman. Brafman spoke to waiting reporters outside Rubenstein's apartment today denying any wrongdoing. He said: 'We do not believe he committed any crime whatsoever and are confident that when the investigation is completed no criminal charges will be filed'. The media-savvy Rubenstein currently represents the family of Eric Garner, who died after a police chokehold during an arrest in July. The case sparked protests and calls for change within the police department. He also represented the family of Sean Bell, killed in 2008 in a hail of police bullets. The city eventually settled with Bell's family for $7.5million. High-profile case: Rev. Herbert Daughtry, far left, Rev. Al Sharpton, second from left, and attorney Sanford Rubenstein, far right, escort Esaw Garner, second from right, the wife of fatal police chokehold victim Eric Garner, after a press conference August  21, 2014 . Rubenstein is a member of the National Action Network and has often stood arm-in-arm with Sharpton at protests. On Monday, Sharpton met with Garner's family and said he would discuss the Garner investigation at a rally on Saturday. Sharpton issued a statement on Sunday saying he was aware of the allegations. 'National Action Network and Rev. Al Sharpton has not been notified or advised by any official investigating authorities,' the statement read. 'The allegations as reported occurred at a private residence after a NAN event and had nothing to do with NAN nor Rev. Al Sharpton, therefore we have no comment at this time.'","Sanford Rubenstein, 70, accused of raping 42-year-old last week in his Manhattan apartment .

"A Los Angeles judge who allegedly knocked a woman to the ground in a dispute over dog mess, has been charged with battery. Superior court judge Craig Richman was accused of pushing Connie Romero to the ground outside his home after seeing her leave a plastic bag of dog poop on a curb on July 18. A lawyer for the judge defended his action, claiming that after Ms Romero fell to the ground she got up and laid in the middle of the street until neighbors found her. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Craig Richman. Richman is accused of pushing Connie Romero from behind and knocking her to the ground, said city attorney's spokesman Rob Wilcox . The dispute is said to have occurred when Ms Romero followed Richman to his drive after he confronted the woman about allegedly leaving a bag of poop on the sidewalk, the Los Angeles Times reported. Ms Romero has accused Richman of pushing her from behind, which left her with a cut over her left eye, a swollen wrist and scraped shoulder after her face struck the ground, city attorney spokesman Rob Wilcox said. When the former county prosecutor walked away Ms Romero called for police, Mr Wilcox said. He was charged on October 16 with one misdemeanor count of battery. The attorney representing the judge claimed Ms Romero had started the spate by throwing a bag of dog poop at him when Richman asked her to put it in a trash can. Dispute: A judge faces a battery charge after confronting a woman he claimed had not cleared up after her dog . Attorney James E Blatt said Ms Romero followed Richman to his drive and pushed him first. When the judge pushed her back, she fell over. But, the attorney claimed, Ms Romero then got up and moved into the middle of the street where she laid until neighbors found her. 'Not only has he done nothing wrong but . it appears … that this is a total fabrication,' Mr Blatt, who is pushing for charges to be dropped before Richman's November 6 arraignment, said.","Dog walker left with cut above her eye and swollen wrist after alleged confrontation .

"Scroll down for video . Whistleblower said senior civil servant Clifford Hindley (pictured), who was head of the Home Office's voluntary services unit, signed off a three year grant for £35,000 in 1980 . A vile paedophile group with links to senior Labour politicians was funded with huge amounts of taxpayers' money, it has emerged. The Paedophile Information Exchange was allegedly given £70,000 by the Home Office between 1977 and 1980 - the equivalent today of about £400,000. The astonishing claims made by a whistleblower are now being investigated by the police and the government. They come after the Mail exposed shocking links between the paedophile group and the National Council for Civil Liberties, a pressure group run at the time by former Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt and Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman. After months of revelations, Miss Hewitt apologised on Thursday, saying the NCCL was 'naive and wrong' in allowing itself to become affiliated with PIE, which campaigned for the age of consent to be dropped to just four. 'As General Secretary then, I take responsibility for the mistakes we made. I got it wrong on PIE and I apologise for having done so,' she said. Miss Harman, who was the NCCL's legal officer, has also expressed 'regret' but has refused to apologise, claiming the Mail's stories were a 'politically-motivated smear campaign'. Yesterday, a former Home Office worker revealed that Jim Callaghan's Labour government and Margaret Thatcher's Conservative administration, which took over in 1979, may have provided funding for PIE. The whistleblower said senior civil servant Clifford Hindley, who was head of the Home Office's voluntary services unit, signed off a three year grant for £35,000 in 1980. He has told police he saw the paperwork and the grant was a renewal - suggesting a similar amount had been given to the group in 1977 under the previous Labour government. Mr Hindley, a classics, philosophy and theology graduate who studied at Oxford and Cambridge, apparently had an obsessive academic interest in gay relationships between men and boys. He was an assistant secretary at the Home Office, where he oversaw 'co-ordination of government action in relation to voluntary services and funding of certain voluntary organisations'. The VSU was in the section responsible for 'community programmes'. A whistleblower has claimed Margaret Thatcher's Conservative administration, which took over in 1979, may have provided funding for PIE . Payments were made to the Paedophile Information Exchange during Jim Callaghan's administration, it is claimed . A colleague at the VSU, based at the Home Office's former headquarters at Queen Anne's Gate, was shocked to discover a re-application to the department for funds made by PIE among a list of applications for taxpayer money. The whistleblower, who did not want to be named, claims he raised concerns with Mr Hindley about why the Home Office should be funding such a vile organisation. He told Exaro investigative website that Mr Hindley, who was his boss, took the paperwork away from him and told him to drop the matter, saying he would 'deal' with it. The documents are now thought to have been legally destroyed along with all Home Office files about PIE since 1979. The whistleblower approached Labour politician Tom Watson last year. The MP has now raised the claims with home secretary Theresa May, who has ordered an investigation. PIE members have been accused of abusing children 'on an industrial scale' during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Harriet Harman MP (left), who was the NCCL's legal officer, has expressed 'regret' but has refused to apologise for her links to the PIE, while Patricia Hewitt apologised on Thursday . The group was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalised and formed an alliance with the NCCL, officially affiliating with the left wing pressure group. PIE leader Tom O'Carroll was on the NCCL's gay rights sub-committee and the group was described in glowing terms by then general secretary Miss Hewitt. The NCCL lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child 'understood the nature of the act' and apparently consented. The group also wanted incest to be legalised. A memo from 1978 showed Miss Hewitt said the NCCL would be prepared to offer legal advice to adults who wanted to have sex with 14-year- olds. The NCCL also placed a recruitment advert for new members in PIE's magazine and Miss Hewitt shared a conference platform with O'Carroll in 1977. Miss Hewitt, Miss Harman and her husband Jack Dromey, a Labour frontbencher, all had key roles at the NCCL. PIE disbanded in 1984 after two former executive committee members were convicted of child-porn offences and the group's leader fled the UK while on bail. Commenting on the possibility PIE was funded by the Home Office, Mr Watson said: 'It's a remarkable state of affairs and the Home Secretary must make sure a report is presented as soon as possible. 'If the allegations are true, it shows how insidious an organisation PIE was that they could even convince the Home Office to give them taxpayers' money.' A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'We are aware of the allegations and the Permanent Secretary has commissioned an independent investigation.'","Police are investigating the claims made by a whistleblower .

"Kylie Bretag was locked up in a detention centre in Mexico since October 20 and finally arrived home to her family on Monday . An Australian woman who was on 'the trip of a lifetime' to celebrate her birthday and graduation, who then got locked up in a Mexican detention centre has finally returned home to her family. Kyle Bretag arrived in Canberra on Monday after more than a week spent in appalling conditions at the detention centre in Tenosique, a small town north of Guatemala. The 30-year-old from Melbourne was arrested by Mexican officials while passing a checkpoint on a bus on October 20 after she was caught travelling in the country without a visa. Ms Bretag crossed the border from California into Mexico on foot to celebrate her 30th birthday with friends early last month, but her passport wasn't stamped so it essentially made her an illegal. She spoke to The Project on channel ten on Tuesday about her ordeal , where she was forced to spend 11 days in cramped jail cells with 20 other woman and children. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Kylie Bretag (pictured) appeared on The Project to talk about her ordeal in a Mexican detention centre . The 30-year-old (right) was meant to meet her close friend Natalie Wayt (left) in Cancun when she was arrested . Ms Wayt said her friend had crossed the border from San Diego to Mexico on foot after hearing that it was cheaper than flying online. She was then arrested while on a bus in Tenosique, north of Guatemala . ‘There were a lot of moments when I thought it would just go on for a lot longer than it did,' she said. Ms Bretag said being back on home soil was incredible. 'It is a little bitter sweet, but it’s more sweet than bitter.’ ‘Being with mum and dad is fantastic and just the relief of being on home soil is fantastic.’ Seemingly not too angry about her ordeal now, she did say while in the cell a language barrier proved difficult to cope with. ‘They were just trying to do their job and I was just in this cell with a lot of other people and nobody spoke English so I was very isolated and I was devastated, I read a lot.’ And communication was frustrating. ‘Everyday I would speak to the lady at the embassy and she would say this is probably what's going to happen today to the best of her understanding,' she told The Project. 'Then I would have the immigration people tell me in broken English, a completely different plan of what would happen that day or when I was going to leave and each day that would be changed to the next day or the next afternoon .’ ‘Being with mum and dad is fantastic and just the relief of being on home soil is fantastic,' said Kylie Bretag (pictured) on returning home from her ordeal . Kylie Bretag (pictured) said she's wasn't scared for her life but was worried about what was going to happen because communication in the detention centre was frustrating . Ms Bretag was on 'the trip of a lifetime' to celebrate both her 30th birthday and graduation from her communications degree . ‘The eleven days that I was there felt like a lifetime.’ When asked if she was scared of her time spent in the Mexican detention centre, Ms Bretag she never felt in that position but was worried about what was going to happen. 'I was completely powerless to do anything about it,' she said. As for whether she will venture back to Mexico for another holiday, no doubt. 'Absolutely, I have to finish what I started, I was having such a good time.’ Natalie Wayt, a friend of Ms Bretag's who was on her way to meet the recent graduate in Cancun before she was locked up, earlier told Daily Mail Australia that Ms Bretag had crossed the border between San Diego and Mexico on foot in order to save money. 'Some travel websites says that if you want to save money go to San Diego and walk the border.' 'It's actually very common, people from the US do it all the time. They just go down there and have lunch and then come back,' Ms Wayt said . Ms Wayt said her friend had asked an official to stamp her passport when entering the country but, 'he didn't say anything, just waved her on' Natalie Wayt tried to get Kylie Bretag (pictured) out of jail with a plea on social media . Kylie Bretag (pictured) talked exclusively to The Project on her ordeal and said she was glad to be home . 'She even asked an official down there, because she had her passport in her hand, she asked him where she could get it stamped and he didn't say anything, just waved her on. There was a massive language barrier.' Fortunately for Ms Bretag, during her ordeal she was able to keep in contact with Ms Wayt and her family at home via a mobile phone. Ms Wayte put Ms Bretag's situation on social media in a bid to help her get out of jail although that didn't have much pull with Mexican authorities. While held in the detention centre, she said her friend just wanted to go home. 'She told me: 'I just want to go home, I'm living a nightmare',' Ms Wayt said. Both her mother Colleen and Ms Wayt said staff at the detention centre continued to promise Ms Bretag that she will be deported and relocated on certain dates, and yet she continued to be held in Tenosique. On conditions in the cell, Ms Bretag told Ms Wayt that she was sleeping on one of the numerous small mats that line the ground in a row on the floor, . She also said she had little time to bathe in the facility with no privacy and described the shower as 'a box with a hole in it' with the water being supplied in buckets filled with recycled water from the sinks. It's believed while she was locked up the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provided consular assistance to Ms Bretag, according to The Age. Ms Bretag was being kept in a crowded cell with up to 20 other women, no clean water to bathe with and is sleeping on a thin mat on the floor . Ms Wayt has begun a media campaign in order to ensure and speed up her friend's release from detention .","Kylie Bretag, 30, returns home to Canberra after spending more than a week in a Mexican detention centre .

"A woman accused of abandoning her newborn baby in a trash can was released from jail on Monday and told reporters as she left that she hadn't known she was pregnant. Alicia Marie Englert, 23, posted $25,000 bond after it was reduced from $500,000 and left the Salt Lake County Jail in Utah on Monday evening. She said she was sorry about what had happened with the baby girl, who is now in the custody of child welfare workers. Alicia Marie Englert, 23, (pictured in court on September 10) posted $25,000 bond and left the Salt Lake County Jail on Monday . Earlier on Monday, a judge reduced Englert's bail and ordered tests to determine if she's mentally competent to stand trial on a charge of attempted murder. Her bail was reduced on certain conditions, Deseret News reported. She is not allowed to have contact with her parents and must live with her brother instead. The only instance that she is allowed to contact them is if she needs a ride to court and then they must not discuss the case. Englert, 23, pictured in an undated mugshot is accused of wrapping her baby in a towel and putting her in the trash . The reasons behind the conditions were not explained in court. Englert's parents have previously said she has a learning disability and didn't understand what she was doing or why it was wrong. She told reporters on Monday she had a disability, which she didn't describe. Messages left with Englert's defense attorneys Zach Weyher and Josie Brumfield were not immediately returned Tuesday. Prosecutors said Englert gave birth in August at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns. She left the baby without food or medical care for at least a day before wrapping her in a towel and abandoning her in the trash on August 26, according to prosecutors. Authorities haven't determined the baby's father, but Englert said on Monday night that the baby's father knows about the child. Englert has been ordered not to contact him. She did not identify the father. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said the baby would have died if she hadn't been found by a neighbor who thought she heard a purring cat. The girl was inside a trash can under bags of trash and suffering from hypothermia, respiratory distress and a blood-borne infection. She has since improved and is now in fair condition, Unified Police said. If convicted, Englert faces up to life in prison. Englert made her first appearance in court last month, where her attorneys said they need time to investigate the 23-year-old's mental condition. Prosecutors say her lack of care shows she deliberately tried to kill the child. Photographs of  Englert, released by a local news channel, suggested she may have been partying while pregnant . 'It's certainly a testament to how resilient these babies can be,' Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill said last month. 'It's quite remarkable that the baby is doing well and is improving steadily.' Fox13 previously published a photo album of Englert allegedly drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing - 'potentially within the same window of time that she was pregnant,' the station said. Investigators don't believe other family members knew about the baby being in the house, Gill said. But her father, Robert Englert, said his daughter has only just recently started to realize what she had done. 'She doesn't even realize that it's a crime and it's bad,' Englert told The Salt Lake Tribune last month. 'Even when the police were taking her to jail, she thought they were taking her to her room.'

"Despite being bathed in solar rays all day, plants have a remarkable ability to avoid sunburn. Now researchers in Indiana have uncovered the process that makes these plants create natural sunscreen. They claim the study could help scientists create lotions that offer better protection from solar rays. Despite being bathed in its rays all day, plants have a remarkable ability to avoid sunburn. Now researchers in Indiana have uncovered the process that makes these plants create natural sunscreen . 'The harsh ultraviolet radiation plants are exposed to daily can cause serious damage to plant DNA and, as a result, hinder plant growth,' said Timothy Zwier from Purdue University. The latest study revealed plants produce special molecules and send them to the outer layer of their leaves to protect themselves from damaging ultraviolet rays. These molecules, named sinapate esters, block ultraviolet-B radiation from penetrating deeper into leaves where it might damage the plant's development. 'To me the beautiful thing is nature has a sunscreen itself,' Professor Zwier told MailOnline. Researchers claim the study could help scientists create lotions that offer better protection from solar rays . 'We always think the leaves want every bit of light they can get, but they have to use certain wavelengths efficiently.' Other studies had been collecting evidence that suggests sinapate esters are protective molecules, but until now, no one has investigated what happens to them under the sun's rays . In the study, the researchers coaxed the molecules into the gas phase and exposed them to UVB radiation from a laser in the laboratory. A study has found plants can identify sounds nearby . Most people don't give a second thought when tucking into a plate of salad. But perhaps we should be a bit more considerate when chomping on lettuce, as scientists have found that plants actually respond defensively to the sounds of themselves being eaten. The researchers at the University of Missouri found that plants can identify sounds nearby, such as the sound of eating, and then react to the threats in their environment. 'Previous research has investigated how plants respond to acoustic energy, including music,' said Heidi Appel, senior research scientist in the Division of Plant Sciences at the University of Missouri. 'However, our work is the first example of how plants respond to an ecologically relevant vibration. 'We found that ""feeding vibrations"" signal changes in the plant cells' metabolism, creating more defensive chemicals that can repel attacks from caterpillars.' They found that the particular sinapate ester that plants use as a screen against UVB was capable of absorbing radiation at every wavelength across the UVB spectrum. The natural sunblock is remarkably efficient at absorbing harsh radiation that could otherwise damage the plant. It's also very similar to the sunblock humans use to protect themselves against the sun's rays. As well as having a natural sunblock, separate research in Bonn, Germany, found plants give off a gas when under 'attack'. Super-sensitive microphones picked up a 'bubbling' sound from a healthy plant. But this rose to a piercing screech when it was under threat. 'The more a plant is subjected to stress, the louder the signal,' said Dr Frank Kühnemann. Plants do not actually scream in pain, but different sounds are heard when the gas they emit, ethylene, is bombarded with lasers. The research could help to work out which pieces of fruit and vegetables are likely to stay fresh longer, as a cucumber which is starting to go off produces a squealing sound. The sunblock is remarkably efficient at absorbing harsh radiation that could otherwise damage the plant .","Researchers exposed the molecules to UVB radiation from a laser .

"Ann Maguire's widower has revealed that he no longer feels he can be a father to his daughters. The heartbreak of Don Maguire was revealed as William Cornick, 16, was jailed for life with a minimum of 20 years for killing his wife at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April. In victim impact statements read out to Leeds Crown Court yesterday, reveal the true extent of the pain felt by the 61-year-old teacher's family following her murder in a classroom was clear. Scroll down for video . Husband and daughters: Don Maguire (right)  and his daughters Emma (front left) and Kerry (front centre), the family of murdered teacher Ann Maguire, stand outside Leeds Crown Court yesterday after the sentencing . Hearing: A sketch from Leeds Crown Court showing William Cornick (face obscured due to earlier reporting restriction), and Ann Maguire's family (front left) Mr Maguire said: ‘I'm still a dad but cannot help my children understand, cannot help them come to terms, cannot help them lessen the pain. Mummy would have been so much better.' He added that he felt he could ‘no longer be a dad’ to his daughters, Kerry and Emma, after the murder. Mr Maguire described the dreams he had of living in a rural backwater with his ‘beautiful, vivacious, generous, caring’ wife. ‘Now all our dreams have gone forever,’ he said. Daughter Kerry said the murder had robbed her of her mother, and her future children of a grandmother. In her statement, she said: ‘Mummy was a constant. Her love was boundless and her heart was open. She was a beacon of light, guiding and protecting me through my life.’ Murder: William Cornick (left) was jailed for life with a minimum of 20 years for the killing of Ann Maguire (right) 'My life today seems to have lost meaning': Shelagh Connor, Ann Maguire's sister, speaks outside court . Mrs Maguire's other daughter Emma said: ‘Every morning, I wake up and I pray that this is all a bad dream, just a split second of hope which quickly vanishes and the horror of the reality sets in.’ Her statement added: ‘She gave us so much love, I never felt alone in life, I had my mummy.’ Mrs Maguire's sister Shelagh Connor told the court that her ‘baby sister’ was an ‘essential part of me’. In her statement, Ms Connor said she felt she had failed to protect her sister. She said: ‘For 61 years, I looked out for her. My life today seems to have lost meaning. ‘My grief and sadness and anger overwhelm me when I think of all that Ann has been robbed of. She will never fulfil her great dreams and plans, she will not grow old with us, in the love of her family.’ Another sister, Denise Courtney, said she was overcome with an overwhelming sense of loss. Ms Courtney said the date of the murder will be etched in her memory forever. 'As a young girl Ann visited the sick and helped the elderly in her local community. 'The hundreds or maybe thousands of wonderful tributes paid to her over the months are testament to the person Ann Maguire. 'The guidance for preparing a victim impact statement advises to avoid turning the victim of the crime into a kind of saint. 'Such advice does not apply in this case. 'Ann was a 61-year-old lady, 5ft two-and-a-half inches tall and weighed eight-and-a-half stone. 'On April 28 this year she was teaching a year 11 class in preparation for their exams just as she had done many times over her 40 years teaching career. 'Out of the blue, Ann was attacked with a knife and murdered. This was a monumental act of cowardice and evil carried out in front of the class. 'The callous cruelty displayed defies comprehension. 'There was no thought for others, for anyone except for self. 'The pain, brutality, shock and horror endured by Ann at the time ... 'What a dreadful place! 'We shall never know why but if age bars the full responsibility, who owns the missing part? 'Ann was a beautiful, vivacious, caring, generous human being. 'She was unique among peers and family. 'We met and fell in love in the spring of 1972. We were a very quiet private couple, constantly dreaming of a rural backwater but the world seemed to shatter our hopes at regular intervals. 'Now all dreams have gone forever. 'I am still a dad but I cannot help my children understand; can't help them come to terms; can't help lessen the pain. 'Mummy would have been much better. I can no longer be a dad. I fail every day. I need Ann. 'Parts of our lives have been brutally taken. The centre of our lives is missing. Our very being has been diminished. Facing the world is very difficult. Facing one's self is very difficult. 'Days are diminished and difficult. Special days will be especially so: Mother's Day, Easter Day, Christmas Day, birthdays. 'We shall be left with anniversaries of sadness. 'There will be no closure. Balance will not return. No level scales. No end. 'For some there will be memories of past times or special occasions. 'For my children and me today is missing. There is an everyday part of ourselves gone. Present and future are but words.' Remembered: A board of tributes left in memory of Mrs Maguire outside Corpus Christi Catholic College . Statement: Monsignor John Wilson, of the Diocese of Leeds, said the loss was 'still deeply felt by her family and friends and everyone at Corpus Christi Catholic College and here in the local community' She said: ‘The day when time stood still and my whole world fell apart.’ Speaking outside the court after the sentencing, the sisters said: ‘The joy of living her life and the fulfilment of her hopes and dreams and passions have disappeared with this horrific, cruel, senseless and cowardly act. ‘No amount of punishment can ever compensate for the loss of Ann's life. No amount of punishment can compensate her family for what we have lost in this beautiful, selfless, caring, patient sister, mother, wife, auntie and nana.’ Mr Maguire, daughters Kerry and Emma, and nephews Daniel and Andrew added in a separate statement: ‘We look to the future with a fragile hope. ‘We wish that nothing of Ann's life be lost, that she will be remembered as a life's partner, a mother, a sister, a Nana Ann, an auntie and genuine teacher with her generous spirit who led by example, always putting others first, especially young people.’ Authorities pledged to support staff and students at murdered teacher Ann Maguire's school ‘for as long as is needed’ following the sentencing of her killer. Nigel Richardson, Leeds City Council director of children's services, also stressed that the attack was ‘not in any way indicative’ of a wider problem in the area. He said: ‘I hope the conclusion of the trial will now help everyone with the difficult process of moving on. We will continue to provide support for all the staff and pupils - as much as is needed for as long as is needed. Corpus Christi Catholic College: Authorities pledged to support staff and students at Mrs Maguire's school . ‘It is clear to me that Ann Maguire will never be forgotten and her lasting legacy will be felt throughout the school and far beyond, across the local community and indeed across the city of Leeds.’ Head teacher Steve Mort praised the response of his staff and pupils following the attack. ‘I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all our staff and students past and present for the way they have coped and continue to cope with the shocking and unprecedented incident,’ he said. ‘I would also like to say thank you for the amazing tributes and messages of sympathy and support that we have received from schools across Leeds, from around the country and from far further afield.’ Monsignor John Wilson, of the Diocese of Leeds, said: ‘Ann's loss is still deeply felt by her family and friends and everyone at Corpus Christi Catholic College and here in the local community. ‘Her legacy is of huge importance to us all and we take collective strength from ensuring that we carry on the passion and commitment that she demonstrated to all the children and young people she worked with over the years.’","Don Maguire: 'I'm still a dad but can't help lessen the pain for my children'

"A drug-addicted doctor has been disqualified from practising after prescribing 'bizarre' treatments to patients and pretending to pick up scripts on their behalf. The Health Care Complaints Commissions took Dr Kim Street to the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal seeking to prevent the 61-year-old from practising due to professional misconduct. In a hearing on the matter this year, Dr Street admitted he had battled with an addiction to drugs of varying intensity from 2002 to 2012. From 2004 to 2006 the former psychiatrist said he was so 'deeply in the throes' of amphetamine addiction that he was taking up to 75 tablets a day of the prescription drug dexamphetamine. Dr Kim Street was banned from practise after he wrote prescriptions for patients and used them for his own drug addiction . In a bid to support his addictive behaviour, the tribunal heard that from 2010 to 2011 Dr Street embarked on a sustained pattern of deceptive conduct. He fabricated patient prescriptions and pretended to pick up medication on their behalf from pharmacists. He also prescribed dexamphetamine to patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In retrospect, Dr Street conceded it was 'bizarre treatment' and he would 'absolutely not' consider prescribing the drug for patients with PTSD in the future. In handing down their decision on Wednesday, a tribunal said Dr Street's conduct was of the 'gravest kind' In handing down their decision on Wednesday, the tribunal said Dr Street's conduct was of the 'gravest kind'. 'Not only did Dr Street engage in self-abusive behaviour that affected his competence to practise, he also implicated unknowingly his patients in his pattern of deception,' it said. Over the past two years Dr Street had shown remorse, taken proactive steps to rehabilitate himself and had won the confidence of colleagues to return to work, it found. But the tribunal said it was still 'too early' for him to resume practice and ordered that he be disqualified from practising for at least 18 months.","Dr Kim Street wrote 'bizarre' prescriptions for his patients .

"A 24-year-old British woman has died at a beauty clinic in Thailand after undergoing a corrective procedure near her tailbone after having liposuction days earlier. The woman, named locally as Joy Williams, stopped breathing after being given an anesthetic during an operation on Thursday night, according to the country's health ministry. Dr Sompob Saensiri, 51, a surgeon at the clinic,  has been arrested amid claims he was not qualified to carry out the procedure, Public Health ministry executive Boonruang Triruangworawat said. Scroll down for videos . Doctor Sompob Sansiri, 51, is lead away by police after a 24-year-old British woman died at his clinic while undergoing cosmetic surgery on her tailbone . Investigators believe that Sompob was not authorised to carry out the procedure at the clinic in Bagkok . Doctor Sompob Sansiri claimed to have trained in the U.S. and been practicing since 1998, but he is now facing ten years behind bars . Police said the doctor has been formally detained at the central criminal court, charged with recklessness causing death. A spokesman told the Bangkok Post: 'The owner of SP Clinic could be jailed for a maximum ten years and fined  20,000 baht (£380) if he is found guilty of the offence. 'Dr Sompob, 51, denied the charges on the grounds he had treated the patient strictly according to approved medical process. In December 2009, a former Miss Argentina died following surgery to make her buttocks firmer. Solange Magnano (right), 38, was rushed to hospital with severe breathing problems after the cosmetic operation. The mother of eight-year-old twins died from a blocked lung artery after spending three days in a critical condition in intensive care. Denise Hendry, wife of former football star Colin Hendry, also died as the result of a liposuction operation in which the surgeon punctured her bowel nine times. She suffered a heart attack, multiple organ failure and blood poisoning, and spent five weeks in a coma. She survived the initial operation, but was forced to undergo 18 operations to fix her bowel. She died seven years later, aged just 42. 'The woman's name is withheld pending notification of relatives.' It is not known if Miss Williams was in Bangkok alone. According to investigators this was the woman's second visit to the clinic. On the first occasion she was given BodyTite liposuction treatments. BodyTite works by inserting a tube under the skin which melts fat using radio waves before it is sucked out. There is also a plate on top of the skin which smooths the surface. The clinic charges between £850 and £1,100 for buttock liposuction, which includes all tests and consultations, however it is not yet clear exactly what surgery the victim was being given. Police and forensic officers were called to the SP Clinic in the Huay Kwang district of Bangkok at around 11pm yesterday to reports that a woman had stopped breathing. The officers found the victim lying on an operating table on the first floor of the four-storey clinic, but were unable to revive her. According to police, there was a three inch-long stitched incision on her tail bone. The body was then wrapped in white sheets and six policemen carried it to a waiting ambulance. It was taken to the Police General Hospital for a post mortem examination. Pol Maj Gen Ittipol Piriyapinyo told reporters that the woman had asked for a corrective procedure to her tailbone area and had visited the clinic before. According to reports, the operation had finished when doctors discovered they were unable to revive the woman. On the clinic's website, Dr Sompob claims to have studied at Chiang Mai University medical school in Thailand, graduating in 1992. According to police the woman had previously had liposuction treatment at the clinic (pictured, medics take her body away from the scene) Officers rushed to the clinic, in the Huay Kwang district of Bangkok at around 11pm yesterday, where they found the woman unconscious on the operating table . The woman was found with a three-inch long incision over her tailbone which had already been stitched up . The 24-year-old was found unconscious on the operating table of this clinic in Bangkok after apparently falling unconscious during a procedure on her tailbone . The profile says he began practicing in 1998, is a member of American Academy of Cosmetic Surgery and member of American Society of Hair Restorection Surgery. Dr Bryan Mayou is a plastic surgeon at the Cadogan Clinic, Chelsea, which has been frequented by the likes of Girls Aloud singer Sarah Harding. He brought liposuction to the UK and has since carried out thousands of procedures. He said: 'Medical tourism is a thing which has been around for a long time. We in London benefit from it, so it is not surprising that people will shop around and often go abroad because it is cheaper. 'We are seeing an increase in the number of patients that are coming to us for corrections following cosmetic surgery abroad. 'At the clinic we have seen a 125 per cent increase in a year, and it can be for all sorts of procedures, but liposuction and breast surgery are the most common. 'If I were looking aboard, even as a surgeon I would find it extremely difficult to know who to trust. 'You have to ask: how is this clinic going to deal with problems? What happens if things go wrong? 'What appears to be a saving, in fact turns out to be anything but.' He also claims to be a member of three other cosmetic surgery societies in America and Korea, and a certified board of two more. Officers are questioning staff and doctors at the premises, and trying to establish whether the clinic was stocked with the correct life-saving equipment. Lardprao police they have notified the British embassy and have sent her body to the Police Institute of Forensic Medicine for autopsy. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We were informed of the death of a British national in Thailand on October 23. We stand ready to provide consular assistance.' Thailand is the world-leader in cosmetic surgery tourism, with websites advertising package deals promising procedures at discounts of up to 60 per cent. While visitors form Australia and the U.S are particularly common, patients have also been known to visit the country from Britain. The industry earned the country £2.68billion in 2013 alone. Of the 26.5 million people who visited Thailand in 2013, 2.5 million went purely for medical reasons. That number has been growing at an average of 15 per cent a year over the past decade. The top procedure in Thailand is dental work, including teeth veneers, though websites advertise beast implants, face lifts, and even hip replacements. Dr Massimiliano Marcellino, a Harley Street surgeon at CosmeDocs who has performed over 5,000 operations, warned about the dangers of going abroad for surgery. Officers found the victim lying on an operating table on the first floor of the four-storey clinic, but were unable to revive her . According to investigators the woman was undergoing her second procedure at the clinic, the first being a BodyTite liposuction operation . Dr Sompob Saensiri, 51, a surgeon at the clinic has been arrested amid claims he was not qualified to carry out the procedure (pictured, officers outside the clinic) He said: 'Around a fifth of the correction surgeries I carry out are on patients who need help after visiting clinics overseas - mostly liposuction and facelifts in Eastern Europe. 'There are fantastic surgeons to be found the world over but the problem is the cosmetic surgery industry can be less regulated in some countries - so standards can vary dramatically depending on where you go. 'In the UK, a surgeon's performance is strictly monitored, with routine training and independent yearly appraisals. As with any form of surgery there are risks and it should not be undertaken lightly.' Investigators are trying to establish whether the clinic, in the Huay Kwang district of Bangkok, had proper life-saving equipment installed .","24-year-old stopped breathing after being given anaesthetic, say police .

"Hundreds turn out for Mark Duggan's farewell in North London . Police massed nearby as his coffin was pulled in a white horse-drawn carriage . The father-of-four, 29, was found with a gun when he was shot dead by police . His loved ones wanted to remember him as an innocent family man. But there was no escaping the murky past of Mark Duggan – the suspected gangster whose death sparked nationwide riots after he was shot by police – as mourners packed a church for his funeral yesterday. In tributes made by relatives before the 1,000-strong congregation he was described as a man who turned his life around with the help of his beloved partner; who loved playing computer games with their three children; who enjoyed getting ‘dressed up to the nines in bling’ to go out partying. Final send-off: The cortege arrives for the Mark Duggan's funeral yesterday. Duggan's brothers, the priest and the undertaker lead the flower-bedecked hearse pulled by plumed horses . A salute to a 'soldier': Mourners lined the streets and raised their palms to say farewell to the father-of-four . Procession: People paid tribute to the man described as a 'fallen soldier' The funeral was held this afternoon for Mark Duggan who was shot dead by police last month. It was his death which sparked riots across England . He was a ‘big kid himself’, said a . cousin. What’s more, she claimed, he was a ‘peacemaker’ who resolved . conflicts in the community. And he had recently applied to become a . fireman. But another side to Mark Duggan’s . life was evident too. It was there in the one-armed salute that men and . women gave as the white, horse-drawn hearse passed along the streets . from Duggan’s family home in Tottenham. And it was there outside New . Testament Church of God in Wood Green, North London, where the service . was held, as friends spoke on the street of Duggan as ‘one of our fallen . soldiers’. Outside the church, where those . mourners who could not fit inside stood on the pavement, the air was . thick with the smell of cannabis. Dark glasses were the order of the day . for men, short skirts for women. For Duggan, 29, was also known as . ‘Starrish Mark’. He was an ‘elder’, or senior member, of The Star Gang, . who strut the streets of Tottenham where such gangs trade in violence, . intimidation and drugs. Yesterday, among the floral tributes spelling out ‘dad’ and ‘son’, there was also a star-shaped wreath. During the 90-minute service Duggan’s . cousin Donna Martin began an obituary by repeating his nickname . ‘Starrish’ three times, eliciting applause from the congregation. She told of his upbringing on the . notorious Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham and how he left aged 13 to . live in Manchester with an aunt. There was no mention of the fact that . Duggan was the nephew of notorious crime boss the late Desmond ‘Dessie’ Noonan who boasted his gang had ‘more guns than the police’ and whose . feared family are ‘major players’ in Manchester’s underworld. But she did tell how Duggan had lost . friends in Manchester in ‘unfortunate circumstances’ and how, after he . moved back to London, he treated his friend Kelvin ‘Smegz’ Easton ‘like a . little brother’. The horse drawn carriage carrying the coffin leads a procession of vehicles to the New Testament Church of God, in Wood Green, north London . Distraught: Friends and family hug before the funeral held at the New Testament Church of God in Wood Green, North London today . Easton, 23, another gang member, was . stabbed through the heart with a broken champagne bottle at a nightclub . in East London last March in a row over drugs and a woman. Duggan is . said to have carried a gun afterwards for his own protection. Another source has said he was . planning to avenge the death, which is believed to be one of the reasons . that officers from Operation Trident, which investigates gun crime . within London’s black community, had Duggan under surveillance and were . trailing him in unmarked cars. He was a passenger in a minicab which . was apparently stopped by police near Tottenham Hale Tube station on . the night of August 4 when he was shot. The Independent Police Complaints . Commission, which is investigating the shooting, said police fired two . shots. One killed Duggan, the other lodged in the radio of another . police officer. Duggan’s gun, originally thought to have been a . converted replica, had not been fired. Two days after Duggan died, the . Tottenham riots erupted after his family spent five frustrating hours . seeking a meeting and explanation from local police chiefs. The . circumstances of Duggan’s death have led to lingering tensions between . family members and detectives. Yesterday policing at the funeral was . low-key. But at least a dozen police riot vans and their officers were . spotted on stand-by nearby. Loved ones: Mourners arrive at the funeral to give the father-of-four a final send-off . Heartbroken: Mr Duggan's distraught mother Pamela weeps as she joins the start of her son's funeral procession . Grief-stricken: Mr Duggan's partner Semone Wilson, holding one of the couple's four children, paid tribute to her 'first real love' Loss: Wearing a T-shirt with a picture of his father and the words 'Miss you Daddy', Duggan's 10-year-old son arrives at church . Back at the church, ten black . Mercedes limos brought Duggan’s loved ones to the church. One of his . three children arrived in a white-striped suit and a T-shirt emblazoned . with the words ‘Miss You Daddy’ and a picture of his father in . sunglasses. In an echo of the image, the little . boy was wearing oversized sunglasses. Along with his baby sister, he was . comforted by his mother, Mr Duggan’s girlfriend Semone Wilson, as they . watched the horse-drawn hearse pass. During Miss Martin’s obituary, we . also learned that Duggan’s favourite films included gangster movie . Scarface and – ‘secretly’, she said – Annie. She repeated the family’s . belief that he would not have pointed a gun at police by saying he was . ‘no idiot and not suicidal’. Duggan’s partner Miss Wilson, 29, paid . tribute to him as her ‘first real love’ in a message read out by her . sister Michelle Palmer-Scott. ‘We faced trials and tribulations . together. We had our ups and we had our downs but through it all, I . loved him,’ she said, adding: ‘I don’t understand why you’re gone so . soon.’ Duggan’s mother Pamela Duggan, 53, . said: ‘In many way Semone saved Mark and that’s why he loved her dearly. She loved him unconditionally like they loved their children.’ Pastor Nims Obunge made an impassioned plea for peace in the community, which he said has seen ‘too much blood’. Devastated: A relative of Mark Duggan holds a child as the family follow the coffin . A long queue of cars follows the ornate cortège as it makes its way to Mr Duggan's private funeral after passing through North London's Broadwater Farm estate, where he grew up . A floral tribute from his family is hung from the side of the hearse carrying the 29-year-old's coffin . Event: Around 750 people packed into the church for the service with many more waiting outside . Gathering: During the funeral, police parked in Alexandra Palace . waiting to be called for duty . Police were close to Tottenham and Wood Green in what appears to be a precaution should any violence flare after the service . ‘Let mothers not have to come and . bury their children. Let fathers not have to come and weep for their . children the way we weep today,’ he said, to whoops and applause. ‘We . have been hurt, we have been scarred, we have been maligned, we have . been stigmatised, we have been called names. Today we stand as one community but we say, “Not any more – it shall stop”.’ Asked about the police’s version of . Duggan’s death so far, Ken Hinds, a friend who was a steward at the . funeral and is chairman of the Stop and Search Monitoring Group for . Haringey, said: ‘It doesn’t fit in with everything that’s known on the . street. ‘It’s caused significant damage. It . has further fuelled the tension in the community and contributed to the . uprising that we experienced.’ Duggan was buried at Wood Green Cemetery before a reception at Broadwater Farm Community Centre. Mark Duggan . An earlier version of this  article suggested that mourners lining the streets as Mark Duggan’s body was carried to his funeral made “gang-style” salutes. We have been informed that the salute pictured above referred to a call by Bishop Kwaku Frimpong-Manson at an earlier service for mourners to “stretch [their] hands towards the casket and thank God for Mark’s life as he begins his heavenly journey”.  We are happy to clarify this and regret any confusion or distress caused.","Hundreds turn out for Mark Duggan's farewell in North London .

"Grand Canyon visitors are being forced to wait their turn at some of the national park’s drinking stations after thirsty elk figured out how to help themselves to water. The crafty animals are surprising tourists by lifting spring-loaded levers with their noses to get a refreshing drink. But the animals are being overly protective and have acted aggressively toward hikers, forcing Grand Canyon officials to take steps to elk-proof at least one water station. Water you doing? Elk interact with visitors at the South Kaibab water station at Grand Canyon National Park . After banning disposable plastic water bottles and installing water stations in an attempt to reduce waste, park officials are now experimenting with a cage around the spouts at one water station and will change the way it is turned on. Around a dozen of the filling stations are set up, but the elk favour one at South Kaibab Trail because it allows them to easily duck back into the woods. The elk don't always back down when visitors approach. Instead, they take a firm stance, particularly when protecting calves or during fall rutting season. Chief resource officer Martha Hahn said: ‘They got a little aggressive about it. They were pretty protective of that water and wanting to get it first.’ Elk have figured out how to use the water stations by lifting spring-loaded levers with their noses . Flagstaff, Arizona resident Ian Tong was hiking rim to rim at the canyon with three other people in 2012 when they saw an elk guarding the water station at South Kaibab Trail. The elk tried to intimidate the group by making clicking sounds with its mouth and following them on either side of the filling station, he said. Tong said: ‘It definitely was a “go away” kind of thing. She wasn't wanting to share.’ Still, he said elk encounters are part of experiencing nature and he saw no problem with them at the watering stations. Park officials say elk have been guarding one water station and intimidating visitors who approach it . There have been no reports of visitors being injured, but the elk have charged at wildlife biologists trying to disperse herds by staring them down or shooting them with paintball and water guns, said wildlife biologist Brandon Holton. He said: ‘Some move, some don't. Sometimes when you shoot them with water guns, they open their mouth.’ If the new water station design works, it will be used at the rest of the stations.","Crafty animals are lifting spring-loaded levers with their noses .

While their only daughter, Evie, 12 was described as having 'boundless and unlimited love.' 'She is empathetic, beautiful, funny, artistic and creative. Her gentle spirit, warmth and absolute kindness are recognized by all who know her.' Last but definitely not least were their heartfelt words for their youngest son Otis, 8.

It is impossible to understand the reason they were blown out of the sky. Our lives are an ongoing hell. The pain we are enduring is unfathomable, and we grieve alongside families in the Ukraine, the Netherlands, Russia, Malaysia, Australia and elsewhere. Please respect our children's memory, and stop this pointless war. No hate in the world is as strong as the love we have for our children, for Mo, for Evie, for Otis.

Another image captured on the nightclub security camera showed Ashman holding the black pistol by his side as he made his way to the exit. During the eight-day trial, it emerged Mr McCalla, a mechanic from Dudley, West Midlands, had hit Ashman with a baton just seconds before he was fatally shot. Witnesses told the jury Ashman fired the handgun repeatedly at Mr McCalla on the dancefloor of the club following an argument.

"British police are to head to Thailand to help investigate the brutal murder of two British backpackers last month, David Cameron said last night. The Prime Minister confronted the Thai military ruler at a summit of European and Asian leaders and demanded UK police be involved in the much-criticised probe. David Miller and Hannah Witheridge were found dead on the holiday island of Koh Tao in September. Scroll down for video . British student Hannah Witheridge (above) was murdered with David Miller in Thailand in September . Two Burmese migrants have been charged with their murders, but there are doubts over the legal process - with claims the pair were tortured before confessing. The Thai prime minister, who took power following a coup in May, had previously rejected all offers of help. But now he has changed his mind - meaning detectives could fly out in weeks. Mr Cameron’s intervention mirrors the decision to send Met Police detectives to Portugal to help investigate the disappearance of Madeleine McCann. British police have also been to Libya to probe the murder of WPC Yvonne Fletcher outside the country’s London embassy in the 1980s. The agreement came in a face-to-face discussion of the controversy surrounding the probe between Mr Cameron and military ruler Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha, the Thai prime minister, at a summit in Milan. Detectives are expected to focus on independent checks of DNA samples central to the case against two Burmese men accused of the crime and their claims to have been mistreated. The semi-naked bodies of David Miller, 24, and 23-year-old Hannah Witheridge were found on the idyllic Sairee beach of the holiday island of Koh Tao last month. Court proceedings have reportedly started against the two suspects amid international concern about the way the case has been handled by the Thai authorities. David Miller was also killed on the Thai holiday island of Koh Tao . During a meeting between Thai diplomat Nadhavathna Krishnamra and Foreign Office minister Hugo Swire this week, concern was raised about how the Thai authorities had handled the investigation, including that police had spoken openly to the media since the murders. The Thai leader had previously rejected offers of help and insisted the UK no longer had ‘any more doubts’ about the quality of the investigation following ambassador-level talks. ‘They simply needed more time to understand it all because we managed to arrest suspects swiftly, even though it seemed impossible at the beginning,’ he was reported to have said. But diplomatic sources said he had finally accepted the sending of a delegation of British police when pressed on the issue by Mr Cameron at the Asia Europe Meeting in Italy. ‘Obviously it is for the Thai authorities to lead and carry out that judicial process,’ a diplomatic source said. ‘But it is important that it is fair and transparent and that both of the families can be reassured that it is the murderers that have been brought to justice.’ The source added: ‘There are two areas we are particularly concerned about. One if the verification of the DNA samples of the suspects, making sure there is further independent verification. ‘And the second is the investigation into allegations of mistreatment of the suspects. ‘What the PM secured this morning was agreement from the Thai PM that we can send some British police investigators to Kho Tao to work with the Royal Thai Police on this.’ Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds. The Burmese workers who have been charged with the killings were paraded in front of the cameras after apparently making confessions, which were reportedly later withdrawn. The suspects, named in reports as 21-year-old bar workers Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, were charged with three offences - conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery. The Prime Minister confronted the Thai military ruler at a summit of European and Asian leaders and demanded UK police be involved in the much-criticised probe . But later reports - denied by the Thai police - suggested that a Burmese embassy official had formally retracted their confessions amid allegations the pair were tortured. The families of the Burmese workers have said they are innocent, claiming the case has been rigged against them. The families of the accused men told the BBC they believe they did not commit the crime, with Win Zaw Htun’s mother adding that the ordeal has left her suicidal. ‘The case has been rigged against my son,’ said Zaw Lin’s mother. In the days after the murders, Prayuth Chan-O-Cha was forced to apologise for suggesting beautiful tourists put themselves at risk by wearing bikinis. The Thai PM, who seized power in a coup in May, was reported to say pretty women made themselves more vulnerable to attacks by wearing a bikini . He said: ‘There are always problems with tourist safety. ‘They think our country is beautiful and is safe so they can do whatever they want, they can wear bikinis and walk everywhere. ‘Can they be safe in bikinis… unless they are not beautiful?’","PM has demanded UK police be involved in the much-criticised probe .

"Gifts: June Shannon apparently purchased a used car for sex offender Mark McDaniel . She has repeatedly denied dating convicted sex offender Mark McDaniel after their alleged relationship led to the cancellation of popular reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo on Friday. But according to TMZ; not only was 'Mama' June Shannon secretly dating McDaniel for several months, she also purchased gifts - including a used car - for him. June allegedly went shopping for the car last month, visiting at least one dealership near her home in McIntyre, Georgia. The website report that the family matriarch told the dealer the vehicle was for 'her daughter.' But sources say it was, in fact, 'secretly' intended for McDaniel. U.S. network TLC, which airs the reality show, apparently 'got wind' of the secret shopping trips. Taking into account other 'compelling evidence' and a photograph published by TMZ showing June and McDaniel in bed together, TLC took steps to cancel the reality show. Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell tells Radar was molested by Mark McDaniel, the man her mother is now allegedly dating . Despite June's denials,TMZ report that child services and the local Sheriff's Department were notified of the reports shortly after the website first broke the story. The show's cancellation was confirmed on Friday by June in a three minute video posted on Facebook which appears to have been taken on her phone. 'I just got a phone call this morning from TLC and as of right now there will be no more production of the show,' she says, looking down and avoiding eye contact with the camera. She went on to deny reports she is romancing McDaniel. 'The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue,' she said. '[Daughter] Pumpkin has openly said that I did not, that I've not dated him, and also his son [has].' She continued: 'I would not ever, ever, ever put my kids in danger, I love my kids too much. That is my past. I have not seen that person in 10 years and don't  want to see that person.' Speaking out: June posted a video on Friday confirming the cancellation of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo . 'You can't believe everything you read': The cancellation came after 'Mama June' Shannon reportedly began dating convicted sex offender Mark McDaniel - allegedly pictured here in a hotel room last month . Convicted: Mark McDaniel is reportedly supposed to be dating Mama June . With their livelihood now in jeopardy, the family matriarch took the time to thank the show's fans for their continuing support over the years. 'We just want to thank, from the bottom of our hearts, the support that we've had from our fans since May 2012,' she smiled 'The experience has been awesome to us. The girls have been able to do things that they would not normally have [been able] to do.' Though the show may be over, with the network confirming that the already-completed fourth season will not air, Mama June insisted it wouldn't be the last fans would see of the quirky family, who will continue to be active in their community. 'We are still going to do our Christmas display, if y'all choose to come out and meet the family still, to support our community,' she said. 'We're also going to keep updating throughout what's going on in our life.' Finally able to speak out with what she called her 'truth video', revealing that the network had 'kind of told us to hush-hush' up until now, the recently separated star also spoke of ending her relationship with partner of nine years, Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson. 'Me and Sugar Bear really have broke up but we are friends and we have stayed civil,' she insists of the father of her youngest child, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson. 'We're better off friends than we were a couple.'

As yells in the background demanded she 'shut up', Mama June wraps up her confessional on the upbeat note that: 'Things happen for a reason in life and you live and learn.' She added to the fans: 'We do love y'all and we care about y'all. We greatly appreciate ever one of y'all and from the bottom of our heart we want to let y'all know that.' TLC confirmed to MailOnline on Friday that the hit reality series has been cancelled and the network will not air the fourth season that was already filmed. 'Supporting the health and welfare of these remarkable children is our only priority. TLC is faithfully committed to the children's ongoing comfort and well-being, they said. A source told TMZ that includes continuing to offer the children tutors, as well as counselling. Mama June's video comes after a previous Facebook message posted on Thursday which urged Honey Boo Boo fans to not 'believe everything you read.' It's over: Here Comes Honey Boo Boo was cancelled by TMZ on Friday . It said: 'Ppl sell stories to the tabloid everyday that r false (sic)! It isnt true i promise my kids r #1 priority over anything else and I would never put them in danger period over this or anything else they r my life this is my past I left him 10 yrs ago for it and I wouldn't go back (sic).' Her 14-year-old daughter Lauryn Shannon - otherwise known as Pumpkin - had also previously spoken to Radar about her mom's prior relationship with McDaniel in a bid to douse the flames. 'The story is not true. My mom left Mark 10 years ago,' the teenager insists, adding: 'They haven’t seen nor talked [to each other] in 10 years.' While TMZ obtained a photo allegedly taken a month ago of the  reality star snuggling up to the 53-year-old in a hotel bed, Pumpkin has slammed the evidence as simply 'Photoshopped'. With Mama June having separated from long-time partner Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson just last month after she allegedly discovered the 42-year-old actively trolling for women on various dating websites, her daughter says the mom-of-four is enjoying the single life. 'She is all about the kids. She only needs us girls, no-one else,' Pumpkin stated. 'We are all sticking together as one happy family with us four girls.'

We're told she's also been setting him up by buying him various gifts.' McDaniel was recently released from prison after serving 10 years, convicted of aggravated child molestation in 2004. In June 2003, he was indicted for aggravated child molestation, aggravated sexual battery and child molestation related to several incidents involving a member of then-girlfriend June's family, aged eight, though the case was dismissed.

"The first police officers to arrive on the scene of the Newtown school massacre have spoken of the unimaginable horror that greeted them, with one describing how he cradled a dying girl in his arms and told her 'You're safe now, your parents love you.' Another brave policeman said he found a little girl standing in shock and covered in blood in the middle of her classroom with the dead bodies of her school friends scattered around her.

Shock: First-grader Henry Terifay and his sister, fourth-grader Kelly Terifay, wait outside Sandy Hook Elementary School after a shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, December 14, 2012 . Officer William Chapman said he and . McGowan traveled the two miles from the station to the school at . break-neck speed after the first reports of gunshots and breaking glass . came in. 'We drove as fast as we've ever . driven,' McGowan told The Times.They got there in under three minutes . as shots were still being fired. Gunman: Adam Lanza, pictured, killed 20 children and six teachers a week before Christmas in one of the worst school shootings in US history . Chapman said the gunfire stopped for a short time. 'But then we heard . more popping,' he said, adding that the officers could tell the gunman was using a rifle. 'It was up so close, . it sounded like it was coming from outside. So we were all looking . around for someone to shoot back at.' After following the sound inside the . school, Chapman walked into a classroom where he saw Adam Lanza dead on . the floor. The officers didn't describe the state of the 20-year-old's . body or how they felt when they first saw him slumped in the room. With another officer, Chapman searched for signs of life among the children and found a girl with a faint pulse. He said he cradled her in his arms and carried her outside to an ambulance telling her 'You're safe now, your parents love you.' Chapman said he later heard the girl had died. Penna was the first to enter another . classroom where Lanza had shot dead most of the victims with a .223 . Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle. Amid the carnage, he said he found a girl standing alone surrounded by dead bodies. She was covered in blood and in shock but otherwise unharmed. Not aware the gunman had been found he told her to stay where she was, . but after seeing Lanza dead he ran back and grabbed the girl to take her . out of the scene of horror. Detective . Jason Frank told The Times the teacher had her young students 'huddled up . like a mother hen' in a corner. Devastating: The tragic last school picture of first graders who were gunned down by Sandy Hook shooter with their substitute teacher . McGowan said the frightened staff . refused to open the doors to police at first, seeking to protect the little . ones in case there was another shooter still on the loose. 'We're . kicking the doors, yelling ""Police! Police!""' McGowan said. He said he and his colleagues were holding their badges up to the window to try to convince the teachers that they were there to help. Detective Frank recalled how he pulled the handle off one of the doors to get to them. As . the children were ushered out of the building, the officers used fatherly voices to comfort them, though they were still . concerned that Lanza had an accomplice. 'Everything is fine now,' they said and instructed the children to hold hands and close their eyes. Safety: Officers raced from the Newtown Police station when they began getting reports of broken glass and gunfire at the school . Brave: Police patrolled the streets outside Sandy Hook Elementary School after the shooting on December 14 and many of them have spoken out about the horrific scene . According . to The Times, the officers stood in front of the teachers' bodies so the children would be protected from the ghastly sight as . they made their way out. Other officers blocked the doors . to the two classrooms where the victims' bodies were slumped on the . floor. As police and state troopers flooded into the school those with young children were warned not to go into the classrooms because the sight of the massacred children was so grisly. 'Words can't describe how horrible it was,' said 27-year Newtown Police veteran Detective Joe Joudy. Most of the officers have said they are suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after the tragedy and one hasn't been able to go back to work since.","Seven Newtown police officers, who were first to arrive at Sandy Hook Elementary school after the shooting, have spoken of the traumatic day .

"A Hawaii woman whose husband died at their son's high school football game in August is grieving again after thieves ransacked their home and stole the couple's wedding rings. John Mahelona suffered a heart attack in August as he watched his son, a defensive lineman, play in Kapolei High School's game against Kahuku High School, KHON-TV reported. The family lives in Nanakuli, a community on Oahu's west side. Mahelona's youngest son returned from school Wednesday to find their home in shambles. Moani Nahulu-Mahelona (pictured) had her wedding rings  stolen by burglars shortly after her husband passed away . Mahelona's wife, Moani Nahulu-Mahelona, said thieves apparently broke in through a window in her son's bedroom. 'I can't understand who would do something like this to us or to anybody,' she said. 'I feel violated. My sons, my husband was our security blanket, so he was our protector and now trying to figure out, how do we protect our home?' The thieves took items belonging to her three sons. 'You took away what I had left of my husband. You took away from my sons. That's why I'm crying. They already gotta deal with not having their father, but you took everything that was left of him,' she said. The burglars also took a small safe. It contained money donated at her husband's funeral and jewelry she holds dear. Moani Nahulu-Mahelona's wedding rings were stolen from her home in Hawaii . 'Our wedding bands. Just jewelry throughout the years my husband had bought for me. Our anniversary diamond rings and Tahitian pearls,' Nahulu-Mahelona said. Nahulu-Mahelona started dating her husband in high school. They lived in their home for more than 30 years. Nahulu-Mahelona hopes the wedding bands can be recovered. 'Just things that he worked so hard in his life and to get and to provide. To provide just those special gifts. That's it. It's irreplaceable,' Nahulu-Mahelona said. Honolulu police are investigating the burglary.","John Mahelona died from a heart attack in August while watching his son's football game .

"A drunk Kate Moss is said to have 'blagged' her way on to a flight from Turkey to London without a ticket on Monday night. The supermodel arrived at Bodrum Airport, south-west Turkey, 'clearly inebriated' after vacationing at a nearby detox centre, and held up a long line of passengers at the check-in desk for an EasyJet flight to London Gatwick. An eye-witness told MailOnline that the 40-year-old spent a significant amount of time talking to the duty manager, suggesting that Moss was trying to travel without a ticket. Scroll down for video . Frequent flyer: Moss was seen looking worse for wear at the airport in Bodrum, Turkey on Monday evening . Turning on the charm: The model was seen chatting to the duty manager for some time, apparently trying to get a ticket . EasyJet representative has since dismissed claims that Kate 'disrupted' the flight following her arrival at the airport, telling MailOnline: . ‘Everybody on that flight had paid for their seat but the delay to the . flight was not related to any one passenger, it was due to a delay of . the incoming flight. ‘The . behaviour of the passenger didn’t disrupt anyone on board and there was . no cause for concern in relation to any of the passengers in terms of . safety and wellbeing.’ Kate, who had been spending time . at The LifeCo, in Göltürkbükü, where she has stayed previously, arrived . at the airport at 8.30pm on Monday. Letting her hair down: Kate Moss is believed to have spent the week at a detox centre . Chatting away: Kate was soon whisked off by the helpful member of staff before boarding the plane . She got in the queue for budget . airline EasyJet’s 9.30pm flight to London Gatwick – a surprising choice . for a multi-millionaire supermodel – and several fellow travellers . reported that she was ‘drunk’ and appeared to be either without a . boarding pass or ticket. One eyewitness told MailOnline: ‘The . general consensus was that she didn’t have a ticket but after chatting . to the manager for some time she was whisked off and ushered on to a . flight. ‘It was pretty obvious that Kate had had a bit to drink as she was talking loudly and didn’t seem worried about being seen.’ Amusing: Fellow travellers took to Titter to comment on their amusement and shock at sharing a flight with 'drunk' Kate . They added: ‘If I had showed up that drunk there’s no way I’d be let on the plane but she is Kate Moss.’ The flight was delayed and did not . take off until 11.51pm, two hours and 21 minutes behind schedule, and . subsequently arrived late at London Gatwick. However, while on-board, the . supermodel mother-of-one reportedly happily chatted away to those around . her. A number of star-struck travellers took to Twitter to say they had spotted the famous model. One user, Rayanne, wrote: ‘Just got off my flight with a very drunk Kate Moss.’ While another, Amelia shared: ‘Seen Kate moss drunk in the airport.’ Fellow holiday-goer Jess tweeted: 'Kate Moss was on the same plane as me yesterday and and she was out of it. (sic)’ A single ticket from Bodrum to London Gatwick on the same EasyJet flight next week costs £129. Images of the model in the airport see . her dressed in her typical rock chick all-black attire carting her own . cabin sized black suitcase and a blue handbag.

Kate, who appears to be accompanied by . a small group of female friends, can be seen smiling away as she is . then ushered through the airport. The visit to The LifeCo is not Kate’s first – she made a trip there ahead of her 40th birthday in January of this year. The centre reportedly offers guests a chance to cut out solid foods – drinking fruit and vegetable juices. According to their website guests will ‘regain long lost vigorous youth, lose weight and toxins’ during their detox. A seven-day detox, which Kate is believed to favour, costs 3640 Euros for those wanting to stay in a suite. A spokesperson for Kate declined to comment.

"Found: Police officer Elisha Duncan (pictured), 46, likely spent every penny of the $40,000 he had collected from colleagues for this weekend's New York Giants football game, it was today claimed . A New York cop who went missing for two days likely spent every penny of the $40,000 he had collected from colleagues for this weekend's Giants football game, it was today claimed. Elisha Duncan, 46, a 14-year veteran of the force, vanished on Wednesday after receiving a $600 fee from nearly 70 officers for a  trip to watch the game against the Seattle Seahawks. He then visited Empire Casino in Yonkers, New York, before being found on Friday sat alone in his parked car in the Bronx. He was in good health, but had no money on him, police said. Now, sources have claimed that Duncan, a known gambler who had recently told relatives he was battling depression, likely blew the entire $40,000 at the casino . Duncan, who allegedly borrowed $1,000 from his sister after leaving the venue on Wednesday night, was later taken to a psychiatric unit at Jacobi Medical Center, where he remains. Investigators are trying to retrace his movements over the past two days. However, they do not plan to ask the cop about the missing funds until his mood stablizes. 'It's a wait and see game,' said one officer. They have already uncovered angry voicemails and texts from fellow officers who had paid Duncan money for tickets to Sunday's West Coast showdown, wanting to know what was going on. Duncan was placed on modified duty after he failed to appear for his shifts at the 46th Precinct in the Bronx. His absence followed his collection of the money for the high-profile game. The cops whom he had collected money from were the ones who reported him missing, according to the New York Daily News. Police initially feared Duncan may have gone off to hurt himself. However, the officer was discovered in his Bronx neighborhood at around 8:30 p.m on Friday after police viewed security footage of him in the casino. Gambling: Duncan vanished on Wednesday after receiving a $600 fee from nearly 70 officers for a trip to watch the game. He then visited Empire Casino in Yonkers (pictured), before being found on Friday . A source later revealed that Duncan had not touched his latest paycheck, and that his ATM card was not used on Thursday or Friday. Duncan's father, 92, told the New York Post that he believes his son went into hiding because he did not have the money to give back to the men and was 'depressed'. Police suggested that the cop - who is divorced and was formerly declared bankruptcy in 2005 - was unlikely to be arrested in the case because of his mental heath issues. However, individual officers could press charges, they said.

"Forget online dating, an unusual new relationship expert says she can help by play Cupid  - by using her psychic powers. Tamara Trusseau, who is in her early 40s and single, told MailOnline she has been aware that she had clairvoyant abilities since childhood and she now uses them to give advice on love. She said: 'From an early age I was aware that I could sense situations and emotions in a way that would not be considered obvious or apparent. I was a teenager before I could truly explore and experiment with what would be generally referred to as psychic ability. Intuitive: Tamara Trusseau said she's had a 'heightened sense of instinctive awareness' from an early age . 'I look upon intuition as a fundamental part of life. To a large degree, psychic ability may be regarded as a heightened sense of instinctive awareness and intuitive perception.' Tamara, who lives in London, says she can use her 'intuitive perception' to help people in situations where they may not see clearly - for instance if a physical attraction is clouding judgement on whether a man is a suitable life partner or if anger or misunderstanding is causing friction in a relationship. She explains: 'Some situations are difficult to handle when you are in there. I can give some clarity and peace of mind. 'Someone might come to me and say: ""Tamara, I came to you and I had no idea what was going on in this situation, I didn't understand this person's actions or feelings but I am walking away now understanding why things have been as they have been, knowing why he behaves how he does"".' Clarity: Tamara said her readings and advice can help people whose relationships may be in trouble . Find love: The psychic advises singles using various techniques including aura therapy and runes . In her own life, Tamara said being psychic has 'many useful elements from little warnings aiding to avoid certain minor incidents, to much greater input, enabling more effective major decisions'. She also says they have helped in her own life, enabling her to avoid sticky romantic situations and understand that not every encounter will lead to marriage. Nevertheless, Tamara who has appeared on Sky Channel Psychic Today where she was dubbed 'The Love Goddess' for her advice and readings on matters of the heart, says she is confident of embarking on a happy relationship of her own in future. She uses techniques including mediumship, aura and colour therapy, cards, runes and crystals to help her clients. When it comes to helping someone single find a suitable match, she said: 'Perhaps rather than saying I find love for clients, it would be more relevant to say I offer guidance that can assist every individual to understand their own potential, needs and requirements, as well as comprehend existing and up-coming possibilities, which can in turn lead to relevant conditions for romantic love.' As for how she assesses if a couple are compatible, she explained: 'Intuitively, I examine and explore existing and potential trends and possibilities. In a practical and realistic way, I make observations and offer recommendations. Of course, I would never be judgemental, reach any unnecessary conclusions or make any decisions on anyone's behalf.' Interactive: Tamara has launched her own TV show so people can get in touch for a psychic reading . Giving enlightenment: Tamara and her team of experts can advise on matters of the heart as well as other issues such as financial woes and career dilemmas . Tamara believes certain issues hold people back from finding love and she addresses these with her clients. 'Obviously, every case is individual. However, if I had to point in any specific direction, the following issues would be particularly valid: Inability to let go of an experience once it has run its course; difficulty in acknowledging and accepting the true potential within a given situation; assumption, based on hopes and desires rather than truth or reality,' she said. Now Tamara hopes she can reach more people after launching her own interactive TV show, www.trusseautv.com, where she invites viewers to get in touch with their problems. The viewer is given a psychic reading to help them towards enlightenment either with Tamara or another of her resident psychics and relationship experts. As well as advising on love, they can also help with other areas such as career or financial woes and will cover holistic topics from reiki healing to karma. As well as helping people with their problems, Tamara hopes the show will banish some of the 'misconceptions' over psychic ability. She said: 'I hope in time, the true benefits and beauty of psychic endeavour can be more accurately understood.'","Tamara Trusseau, from London, says she has clairvoyant abilities .

Charlie Gurion, who with David Wilk in February became the first couple in Cook County to get a same-sex marriage license, said there was a different feel to the parade this year. 'I think there is definitely like an even more sense of pride now knowing that in Illinois you can legally get married now,' Gurion said, as he posed for photograph after photograph with Wilk at the parade. 'I think it is a huge thing and everybody's over the moon that they can do it now.' From the East Coast to the Midwest and the Pacific, seven more states legalized same-sex marriage, boosting the total to 19, plus Washington, D.C. The Obama administration moved vigorously to extend federal benefits to married gay couples. And in 17 consecutive court decisions, federal and state judges have upheld the right of gays to marry. Not a single ruling has gone the other way.

"The average person in Britain spends £50,000 on alcohol on their lifetime, a survey has revealed. This equates to £787 each year, with Londoners spending nearly an extra £100. However there is also a hardcore 1.3 million who spend almost triple the average, shelling out £167,000 on booze during their lifetime. Scroll down for video . Happy times: The average person in Britain spends £50,000 on alcohol on their lifetime, with Londoners splurging the most cash on booze . The figures, compiled for Macmillan Cancer Support, show men splash more cash on booze, spending an average of £934.44 per year, compared to women who fork out £678.60. When it comes to the drink of choice, around one in three people surveyed said wine was their top tipple, followed by beer and then spirits. However among 18-24 year-olds, spirits topped the list as the preferred tipple, whereas the over 45s preferred wine. The research, involving 2,000 people, was conducted to mark the launch of Macmillan's Go Sober for October fundraising event. Macmillan is asking people to sign up for the Go Sober challenge, abstaining from drinking alcohol during October and being sponsored to do so. Commenting on the findings, Martin Lewis, from Moneysavingexpert.com, said: 'It's not just the price of buying booze that costs, it's the fact when we drink we lose our spending inhibitions too. 'We all know the cheap night out that turns into a pocket killer, so even going sober for a month could save you a significant amount. 'Not only will you be saving cash, but helping people affected by cancer. Research released by the charity earlier this month found the average British person spends almost a year of their lives nursing a hangover. It is estimated we spend 315 days of our lives battling with headaches and nausea caused by drinking. Taste: When it comes to the drink of choice, around one in three people surveyed said wine was their top tipple, followed by beer and then spirits . The poll also revealed a north-south divide with the frequency of hangovers, with 22 per cent of people from the north likely to have more than four hangovers each month compared to 15 per cent of people from the south. Women's hangovers appear to last longer - with the average lasting nine hours - compared to a seven hour hangover suffered by men. The study suggests that being hungover could jeopardise your chance of finding romance or getting your dream job. One in every 13 of those surveyed said they had missed a first date because they were too hungover and one in ten said they had missed a job interview. Macmillan is asking people to sign up for the Go Sober challenge, abstaining from drinking alcohol during October and being sponsored to do so. If you do have a special event during October and want to drink alcohol for it, your friends or family can buy you a 'Golden Ticket' by donating £15 or more to your fundraising page. To sign up or find out more, visit gosober.org.uk . Shamefully, eight per cent of those surveyed admitted they had missed a wedding thanks to a hangover, and six per cent admitted they had missed a funeral. Over half said the most annoying aspect of being hungover was that it made them feel sick while more than a quarter said wasting time was their biggest bugbear. Of those who complained about a hangover being a waste of time, a quarter said if they weren't hungover, they'd have more sex. A hangover also prevented people from taking part in more edifying activities. A further 16 per cent said they'd learn a language, 41 per cent said they'd exercise more and 13 per cent said they'd learn an instrument. Hannah Redmond, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: 'By taking part in Go Sober for October, abstaining from drinking alcohol for the month of October and being sponsored to do so, you'll save money, reap the health benefits and raise vital funds to support people affected by cancer so they don't have to face it alone.'","Londoners spend the most on alcohol - an average of £886 per year .

"The U.S. government has issued an urgent plea to more than 4.7 million people to get the air bags in their cars fixed, amid concern that a defect in the devices could possibly kill or injure the driver or passengers. The inflator mechanisms in the air bags can rupture, causing metal fragments to fly out when the bags are deployed in crashes. Safety advocates say at least four people have died from the problem and there have been multiple injuries. Multiple automakers have recalled vehicles in the U.S. over the past two years to repair air bag inflators made by Takata Corp., a Tokyo-based supplier of seat belts, air bags, steering wheels and other auto parts. Plea: The U.S. government has issued an urgent warning to more than 4.7 million people to get the air bags in their cars fixed, amid concern that a defect in the devices could possibly kill or injure the driver or passengers . In a statement Monday, the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration warned owners of those cars to act right away. The agency has been investigating the problem since June, and has cited reports of six inflators rupturing, causing three injuries. Worldwide, automakers have recalled about 12 million vehicles because of the problem. The warning covers cars made by Toyota, Honda, Mazda, BMW, Nissan, General Motors and Ford. Passenger or driver air bags or both could have the faulty inflators. Safety advocates say the problem could affect more than 20 million vehicles in the U.S. Faulty: The inflator mechanisms in the Takata air bags can rupture, causing metal fragments to fly out when the bags are deployed in crashes .

Total vehicles affected: 133,221 . Mazda . Total vehicles affected: 18,050 . The rare action by federal regulators comes three weeks after a Sept. 29 crash near Orlando, Florida, that claimed the life of a 46-year-old woman. In that crash, Hien Thi Tran suffered severe neck wounds that could have been caused by metal fragments flying out of the air bag on her 2001 Honda Accord. Her Accord was among the models being recalled. One police agency concluded that the air bags caused her wounds, while another is still investigating. NHTSA is seeking information in the case. Toyota on Monday issued a recall covering passenger air bags in 247,000 older model vehicles including the Lexus SC, Corolla, Matrix, Sequoia and Tundra. Like many earlier recalls, Toyota's covers vehicles in South Florida, along the Gulf Coast, in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Saipan and American Samoa - all areas that have high absolute humidity. Toyota said it's working with Takata to pinpoint the cause of the rupture and to gauge the influence of high absolute humidity, which is a measurement of water vapor in the air. Toyota could expand the recall to more areas pending further testing, according to spokesman John Hanson. Toyota says it knows of no crashes or injuries in the recalled cars. The NHTSA has urged people to check if their car has been recalled by going to its website and typing in their vehicle identification number. Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, estimated there are 20 million to 25 million cars in the U.S. alone that are equipped with the faulty air bags. Recall: Toyota has recalled 247,000 vehicles in high-humidity areas including South Florida, along the Gulf Coast, in Puerto Rico, Hawaii, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Saipan and American Samoa . In the Florida case, Tran turned left in front of another vehicle and the front ends collided. Her air bag inflated. The original report on the death said the seat belt could not have cut the right side of her neck. Also, there was no broken glass and no other apparent cause of the neck wounds. Supplier: The air bag inflators are made by Takata Corp., a Tokyo-based supplier of seat belts, air bags, steering wheels and other auto parts . Initially the case was turned over to the Orange County Sheriff's Office, whose homicide investigators determined that the air bag caused Tran's neck injuries, the Orlando Sentinel reported. Because the death appears to be traffic-related, the matter was sent back to the Florida Highway Patrol, which has not finished its investigation. The Highway Patrol will call in an air bag expert to help make the determination, said Sgt. Kim Montes. The car's steering wheel and spokes were not damaged and appeared to be a normal air bag deployment, she said. Investigators also will look for evidence of metal fragments in the car and try to determine what caused Tran's neck wounds, Montes said. Last week, two U.S. senators questioned why the safety agency was limiting the recall to certain regions. They cited the May 27, 2009, death of 18-year-old Ashley Parham of Oklahoma City as proof the problem can occur in areas where humidity isn't so prevalent. Parham was driving a 2001 Honda Accord across a high school parking lot in Midwest City, Oklahoma, when it hit another car. The air bag inflated and sent shards of metal into her neck, causing her death. Takata said on Monday that it supports Toyota's recall decision and will continue to support NHTSA and its customers with replacement parts and technical analysis.

"Overstretched GPs have been given the green light to strike thousands of patients from their lists. So far, 25 surgeries across England have been granted approval by NHS bosses to shrink their catchment areas as they cannot cope. Some practices have already removed as many as 1,500 patients from their lists, including elderly widows, amputees, young mothers and – in one case – all the residents of a care home. So far, 25 surgeries across England have been granted approval by NHS bosses to shrink their catchment areas as they cannot cope (File photo) A further ten surgeries have applied this year to cut their registers and are awaiting approval. GPs say they are in the grip of a recruitment crisis and cannot provide safe care for the rising numbers of people moving to their areas. Some of the worst-affected surgeries are where the population is soaring due to migrants and elderly couples who need many appointments. On top of this, many GPs are retiring, moving overseas or quitting altogether and there is a shortage of new doctors entering the profession. Figures from NHS England – obtained by GP trade magazine Pulse – show that 15 practices were granted approval to shrink their catchment areas in 2013/14 and another ten so far this year since April. Officials would not identify individual surgeries but they are in areas including Surrey, Sussex, Greater Manchester, Leicester, Lincolnshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire. Dr Peter Swinyard is the chairman of the Family Doctor Association, which represents GPs . Dr Maureen Baker, the chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ‘This is an extremely distressing situation for patients and for GPs. Every patient should be able to see their family doctor when they need to, and GPs want to provide the best possible access and care for all their patients. ‘No surgery wants to de-register patients. This is still extremely rare and only takes place as a very last resort. Unfortunately, what we are seeing now is a sad consequence of the desperate shortage of GPs, with many practices finding it difficult to replace doctors who are retiring.’ So far this year, 15 requests had been rejected and six withdrawn. Patients who are struck off usually receive an apologetic letter from the surgery telling them they will have to register elsewhere. But there is no guarantee they will easily find another GP to take them on, especially in rural areas. Some of those removed by a practice in Watton, in Norfolk, now have to make 16-mile round trips to the next town to see a doctor. Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, which represents GPs, said: ‘This is people just basically saying, “We are not coping.” They are completely overstretched and struggling to find the medical staff to look after the patients.’ Katherine Murphy, the chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘The shrinking of GP lists is unacceptable. We must protect GP services and achieve real choice for patients. ‘Patients have no control over when they are going to be sick and therefore they must have access to a GP.’","Some practices have removed as many as 1,500 patients from their lists .

"Reprieve: Reyhaneh Jabbari was set be hanged tomorrow morning after seven years in prison. She killed a man she said was trying to rape her . A 26-year-old Iranian woman who was going to be hanged tomorrow after killing a man she claims was trying to rape her has had a stay of execution. Reyhaneh Jabbari was sentenced to death by a criminal court in Tehran in 2009 after what Amnesty International called a 'deeply flawed investigation and trial which failed to examine all of the evidence'. In 2007 the former decorator stabbed Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi, a former employee of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence, who she claims lured her to his house with a promise of work and tried to sexually assault her. Her mother, Shole Paravan, confirmed the execution had been postponed. Today she and other supporters of Jabbari went to Rajaiy Shahr Prison, about 20 miles west of Tehran, to protest the pending execution. Amnesty International said the execution has only been delayed for 10 days. Paravan told Fox News about the heart-breaking farewell phone call she received from her daughter before the postponement. 'I am currently handcuffed and there is a car waiting outside to take me for the execution of the sentence,' Jabbari told her mother. 'Goodbye, dear Mum. All of my pains will finish early tomorrow morning. 'I’ll see you in the next world and I will never leave you again because being separated from you is the most difficult thing to do in the world.” There are concerns over the way the case was handled by Iranian authorities. Amnesty reports she was placed in solitary confinement for two months, where she did not have access to a lawyer or her family. Earlier Jabbari’s mother said in a Facebook post that prison authorities told her she would have to go to the facility to 'collect the body' tomorrow. Raha Bahreini, rersearcher on Iran, says the threat of execution still looms, as under the Iranian law 'qesas', or 'retribution-in-kind', the family of the dead man can still demand that she die. She told MailOnline: 'It's good news but there is still serious concern because her sentence is still in place. 'It can still be carried out at any time at the request of the deceased's family. 'It is not the first time she has been taken to be executed and it was cancelled. You can only imagine the level of psychological damage that inflicts on her and her family.' Reyhaneh Jabbari handcuffed at police headquarters in Tehran after she was arrested for the murder of a former intelligence official in 2007. Amnesty International called the investigation and trial 'deeply flawed' 'Instead of continuing to execute people, authorities in Iran should reform their judicial system, which dangerously relies on processes which fail to meet international law and standards for fair trial,' added Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director at Amnesty International. 'Under international human rights standards people charged with crimes punishable by death are entitled to the strictest observance of all fair trial guarantees.' The Secretariat of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which opposes the nation's leadership, said she was secretly transferred between prisons in a bid to prevent protests by other inmates who are sympathetic to her plight. A man who killed an Iranian youth  in a street fight with a knife in 2007, is brought to the gallows during his execution ceremony in the northern Iran city of Nowshahr. The mother of the victim spared his life soon after . Revolutionary justice: Iranians watch the execution of two convicted gang rapists in 2002 . The organisation also claims that Jabbari underwent 'savage tortures' to extract a confession. A statement said: 'The misogynic regime of the mullahs is attempting to intensify the atmosphere of terror in the society and to terrorise all women and youth who have not succumbed to the oppression and vulgarly of regime’s elements.' MEP Gérard Deprez, the chair of Friends of a Free Iran, a pressure group in the European Parliament, earlier called on Iran to halt the execution. He said: 'Hassan Rouhani’s government has hanged more than 1,000 people, many of them in public squares in Iranian cities. This is the worst record by any Iranian president for the past 25 years. 'If human rights are not improving in Iran, continued talks will only be seen as a green light for further aggression by the regime against its people as well as spreading its terror to other countries of the region. 'It is time the west imposes sanctions on Iran’s human rights violations with no further delay.'","Reyhaneh Jabbari was to be hanged tomorrow morning at a prison .

"Cattle across Switzerland are being deafened by their own cow bells - which make more noise than a chainsaw on full-throttle, scientists have claimed. Farmers have been warned not to adorn their livestock with the traditional 12lb-bells in a move that could signal the death of one of the country's most iconic symbols. The large bells -  primarily used by farmers to locate cattle grazing on alpine pastures - can reach volumes of up to 113 decibels, which is louder than a chainsaw or a pneumatic drill. Bell's toll: The large bells - primarily used by farmers to locate cattle grazing on alpine pastures - can reach volumes of up to 113 decibels . Worse still, researchers found that cows who wear the iron gongs eat less than their bell-free companions, although they aren't sure if that is down to their noise or weight. The findings were revealed in a paper  by agricultural scientist Julia Johns and her team of researchers at the  Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETHZ). They spent months testing more than 100 cows in 25 farms, monitoring their activity, head movements, reactions to sound and feeding behaviour. The paper suggests that thousands of cows – whose hearing is more sensitive than a human's – may already be irreversibly deaf. Anger: One farmer pointed out that the 12lb-bells used in the study were in fact size 31 and only used for one day a year on ceremonial occasions, like this in Grimetz, in the Swiss Alps . The bells: Cow bells come in many shapes and sizes and are primarily used by farmers to locate cattle grazing on alpine pastures . Lolita Morena of the Swiss animal protection group told daily Le Matin: 'We didn't need long university research to tell us that the bells are not beneficial to cows. 'Farmers will just have to spend a bit more time finding their cows in bad weather, like shepherds do. It's difficult work... but they chose it.' Johns suggested technology could be the answer, saying: 'In this IT age we could replace the bell with a microchip and the farmer could then locate his cattle using a smartphone.' But farmers have reacted angrily to her suggestion, claiming GPS signal would be patchy at best in the remote and hilly terrain of the Swiss mountains. 'They can't be serious,' responded Jacques Bourgeois, director of the Swiss Countryside Union, in Le Matin. 'These researchers have completely missed the point. I wonder if they've even stepped out of their lab and been to the mountains.' He pointed out that the 12lb-bells used in the study were in fact size 31 and only used for one day a year on ceremonial occasions. Swiss Tourism spokesperson Véronique Kanel was also displeased with the findings, saying: 'It would be the end of a myth, of an image of Switzerland.' The row continues.","Researchers in Zurich studied more than 100 cows in 25 Swiss farms .

"Courageous: Medic Hannah Cook of Devon was caught in two blasts in her first week on the frontline . A female Royal Navy medic hit by two bomb blasts in her first week is back on the frontline after insisting on being allowed to return to Afghanistan. Hannah Cook suffered serious injuries, including deafness and deep shrapnel wounds, after being caught in an IED blast on routine patrol just days into her first tour in in Nahr-e Sarraj South. The 22-year-old, from Lympstone, Devon, had already saved the life of a comrade who lost a leg earlier in the week following a similar blast whilst part of a similar sortie in the troubled Helmand Province. But just three months after both explosions, which left her suffering severe shock, MA Cook has flown back into the warzone because she was so desperate to rejoin her comrades. Speaking from Afghanistan, Hannah told how returning to frontline action - where she continues to patrol some of the most dangerous hot spots - has seen her accepted by comrades. She said: ‘As a female, you feel you have to prove yourself and show you're not going to fail them in patrols. ‘But once they know you just get on with it, they accept you. After that incident, they respected me straight away. ‘It sounds horrible and of course you do not want anyone to be injured - but it's good to put it into practice.’ MA Cook added: ‘You can be the best or the worst soldier, but it does not matter with IEDs. It is a game of chance. ‘I was not at all put off by what happened. I am here to do a job; if there are consequences, you deal with them.’ MA . Cook was on a routine checkpoint patrol in Nahr-e Sarraj South in April . when a comrade seven men down was caught in a horrific blast. Patrol: Soldiers near Nahr e Sarraj South in Afghanistan, where MA Cook was on a routine checkpoint patrol in April . She rushed forward to stem the flow of blood gushing from his wounds - which probably saved his life - despite the threat of gunfire and other potential IED's. The explosion, just 15 minutes away from their destination, caused the soldier to lose one of his legs, but amazingly escape with his life. MA Cook said: ‘I saw the whole explosion but because of the dust cloud, I couldn't see what was going on. I was about seven men behind but when there was a call for a medic, I ran the fastest I have ever run. ‘It sounds cliché, but the training really did kick in. It felt good to put my medical skills into use so early on. I was holding his hand, telling him he was ok and I felt I was making a difference.’ Days later, while on another routine foot patrol, she was caught in a second blast, this time causing her extensive injuries including deafness and lacerations. ‘I was not at all put off by what happened. I am here to do a job; if there are consequences, you deal with them’ ‘I remember the whole incident,’ she added. ‘I saw I was bleeding and remember hoping all my limbs were still there. I saw both my legs and both my arms and I was so relieved.’ The blast, triggered during a routine patrol, caused serious shrapnel wounds to two other servicemen, one of which was saved but will not return to Afghanistan. The other returned to action after undergoing treatment but later sustained a gunshot wound in a separate incident and is still being treated. MA Cook said: ‘As soon as I was injured, I wasn't able to provide any treatment myself. There was nothing I could give to the situation. ‘But I kept saying I wanted to treat them. I was in shock and the lads were having to tell me I was not in the right state to help. ‘I feel so lucky about the injuries I sustained. It could have been a lot worse. ‘I saw I was bleeding and remember . hoping all my limbs were still there. I saw both my legs and both my . arms and I was so relieved' ‘It was strange for me to be a casualty, but everyone who dealt with me was absolutely brilliant, from start to finish. ‘What this sort of incident does is make you realise how vulnerable you are. As a medic, you don't think you're the one that's going to be injured. It puts everything into perspective.’ Lieutenant Jay O'Malley, second in charge (2IC) of A squadron close support medical group, praised her bravery, adding: ‘She was blown up twice in her first week and dealt with massive trauma. ‘She did not have to come back out, but she wanted to. You cannot ask any more of someone than that.’","Hannah Cook suffered deep shrapnel wounds after being caught in an IED blast that left her in shock .

"Conservationists are testing technology which could use the ‘gaps’ between digital television channels to monitor endangered wildlife in remote areas. Experts are testing so-called television white space (TVWS), which can be transmitted over long distances, and through obstacles such as trees, to send footage from remote cameras. It is hoped that the vacant frequencies will allow conservationists in the field to accurately monitor areas such as rainforests or deserts, where it has previously been difficult to study wildlife. Scroll down for live stream examples . Experts are testing whether so-called television white space (TVWS), could be used to transmit data over long distances and through obstacles such as trees, to send footage from remote cameras. The system could be used to glean fresh information about endangered animals such as tigers (pictured) For now, it is being trialled a little closer to home - in London Zoo.

This system allows members of the public to help identify wild animals photographed by motion-activated camera-traps. Using television white space could significantly boost the range, and capability, of this current system, ZSL said. The scheme is one of a number of trials of new wireless technology, with broadcasting regulator Ofcom working with the industry to see how it might be put into practice - making the UK the first country in Europe likely to use it. Other trials include using TVWS to provide early flood warnings, by monitoring water levels in real time and sending the information over the white space, and using the technology to provide internet and communications to ferries in the far north of Scotland. Philip Marnick, group director of Ofcom’s spectrum policy group, said: ‘In a world where consumers’ demand for data services is experiencing huge growth, it is essential we find the most efficient ways to share the airwaves. ‘White space technology could be one way of meeting this demand.’ Members of the public can tune in and see what the otters, meerkats and giant tortoises are getting up to 24 hours a day during the two-month trial period. The otter live stream is shown above . ‘The prototype systems at ZSL London Zoo are already demonstrating that they can transmit high definition video over long distances, confirming their invaluable potential to use wireless connectivity to transform ZSL’s worldwide conservation work,' said ZSL's Louise Hartley. There's  a camera in the tortoise enclosure (pictured)","Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Google are testing so-called television white space (TVWS) at the capital's zoo .

A 42-year-old man, believed to have been known to both victims, was arrested by gardai in connection with the deaths. A Garda spokesman said the suspect was being held at a station in Buncrana under the provisions of Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act. There are conflicting reports about how the elderly couple may have died. The grim discovery was made just after 9am today. Mr Cuddihy, a technology teacher at Carndonagh Community School, was also a past captain of Ballyliffan Golf Club and was described as a 'jovial' and 'bubbly character' on its website.

'You do not think things like this will happen on your doorstep but, sadly they do. 'It is a very sad day. The couple would be very well-known and were well-liked in the area. They have a big family connection in the town. 'I would have known them personally and would have worked with them as part of my own work. It really is a tragedy.' A priest was called to the house to administer the last rites just before 10am. The large, well-kept bungalow has been sealed off for much of the day pending a garda forensic examination. Mr Cuddihy was a technology teacher at Carndonagh Community School . Floral tributes have been left at the driveway to the property. Albert Doherty, Sinn Fein councillor in Carndonagh, who knew the family, said everyone was still trying to come to terms with the tragedy. He said: 'They are a very well known family; very respected and very popular. 'The man of the house was a retired teacher and his wife was a nurse who would have assisted a large number of people in the ambulance service between Inishowen and Letterkenny Hospital where she was a nurse. 'To die in their own home and in their own community is very tragic. Our thoughts are with the family members who are grief-stricken at this time.'

'Paul (the pilot) also had test flights to make sure he could stay as low as possible. In the end of the day though, there's only so much safety you have with a stunt like this.'

"Just two months after anti-Semitic flyers were distributed across Sydney's eastern suburbs, the same Sydney Neo-Nazi group has sent out more vile letters - this time accusing Jewish residents of swindling tax payers' money. It appears the letters were prompted by reports of  a bomb proof wall which is being constructed at a local Jewish school and funded by the federal government. Since August, the Jewish community have been the target of anti-Semitic slurs including a group of teenagers who allegedly launched a tirade at Jewish students when they boarded a bus in Randwick, Sydney's east. Another incident involves residents in Bondi receiving anti-Semitic flyers in their letterboxes which urged 'white Australia' to 'wake up'. Two months ago this flier was distributed around Bondi in Sydney's east, which has a high population of Jewish people . More flyers were distributed around the same area in response to the construction of a bomb proof wall at a local Jewish school . The concrete wall in front of Yeshiva Centre in Bondi was funded by private donations and $519,000 granted through the federal government's 2012 $20 million Secure Schools Program . The recent flyer, signed off by a Sydney chapter of Stormfront called Squadron 88, attacks Jews by describing the community as 'the leering hooked nosed race of people' while questioning the erection of 'a security school wall in one of the safest parts of Sydney'. 'Are you living next door to these people? The people who steal billions of our money?' the flyer continues. 'It's time for all White Australians to stop being blinded by political correctness and Jewish lies about equality, multiculturalism and the need for so called diversity. Diversity really means white genocide.' Daily Mail Australia previously reported the Yeshiva Centre in Bondi put up the concrete wall in front of its college last month, as part of security measures due to the rising anti-semitism in the area. The construction was funded by private donations and $519,000 granted through the federal government's 2012 $20 million Secure Schools Program. It is understood the wall, designed with the help from Israeli expertise, can withstand the force of a car bomb outside the centre. The letter was signed off by Squadron 88 which is a Sydney offshoot of neo-Nazi group Stormfront, whose logo is pictured here . Several incidents aimed at Jews have occurred over the past couple of months . CEO of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies Vic Alhadeff previously told Daily Mail Australia that 'it's no coincidence that 88 [in Squadron 88] represents HH, which stands for Heil Hitler'. He made the comments after residents in Bondi received anti-Semitic flyers in their letterboxes two months ago, which urged 'white Australia' to 'wake up'. The letters claim 'the Jews' encourage 'race mixing' and that they 'own' Hollywood and the majority of western media. Another incident involved a group of teenagers who allegedly launched a tirade of anti-Semitic slurs when they boarded a bus in Randwick, Sydney's east, in August. Children as young as five were among the busload terrorised on when the young men dressed in baggy pants and t-shirts boarded the bus at Randwick, just before 4pm. Several students made frantic calls to their parents after the youths started yelling 'kill the Jews' and 'free Palestine', and 'Heil Hitler'. Daily Mail Australia is waiting for a response from Squadron 88.","The flyers distributed in Bondi, Sydney's eastern suburbs, in response to the construction of a bomb proof wall at a Jewish school .

For me, I've always had a healthy lifestyle. If I eat something that’s not fresh, I feel it immediately, so I crave good food,’ she told OK! Magazine. ‘I crave meat. I grew up on a dairy and beef farm, so I crave that. I don’t cut anything out, and I just work out more,’ she explained. Although the final 'Train like an Angel' video, staring Alessandra Ambrosio, has yet to be released, the teaser suggests it will involve moves such as lunges and toning stretches. With the brand due to host its first ever London fashion extravaganza on the 9th December the pressure is on for the models to make sure every inch looks perfect. While Justin Bieber, who famously appeared on the catwalk in 2012, and last year's musical model Rihanna, are unlikely to appear, big name singers and bigger name guests are expected to attend and the eyes of the world's media will be focused on the famous catwalk - and the bodies strutting down it.","Sneak peek of workouts used by Adrina Lima and Candice Swanepoel .

"The grandfather of premature twin babies has spoken of the heartbreaking decision to turn their life support off before their mother was ever able to meet them. Melody and Rose Clarke were born on October 29 eight weeks premature when their mother, Jocelyn Bennett, was rushed to hospital having suffered a placental abruption. While the 27-year-old remains in a coma at Birmingham Women's Hospital, her father, Joe Bennett, has spoken of the agonising decision to turn off her daughters' life support six days after their birth. Premature twins Melody and Rose died six days after being born by Caesarian section after emergency services took 30 minutes to help their mother, Jocelyn Bennett (pictured right), who is in a coma . Jocelyn Bennett phoned 999 after waking up with severe stomach pains. The 27-year-old had suffered a placental abruption . 'We wanted Joyce to see them so asked to keep them alive until Tuesday at 1pm,' Joe Bennett, the babies' grandfather said. 'That's the decision I made and I will have to live with that for the rest of my life. 'We knew they weren't going to make it.' Melody and Rose were born on October 29 via emergency C-section after their mother, Jocelyn, phoned 999 shortly after 5am. Paramedics arrived at the tower block of flats where she lives minutes later, but were locked out for half-an-hour as the 27-year-old writhed in agony inside. By the time they accessed the building, Ms Bennett's was barely conscious and she was rushed to hospital. After being born in an emergency procedure on October 29 doctors, placed the babies on life support to fight organ failure at the family's request, in the hope their mother would regain consciousness. But on November 4 after neither Ms Bennett or the babies showed signs of improvement, their ventilators were turned off. With his wife Lorraine and the twins' father Kevin Clarke, Mr Bennett celebrated Christmas with a small party in the hospital for the babies, and witnessed their baptism on the day they were born. The babies grandfather Joe Bennett (left), his wife and their father held a Christmas party for them at hospital before turning off life support. The family ensured a photograph of their mother, Jocelyn, was near to them . The tiny babies were starved of oxygen by the time they were born by C-section on October 29 . 'It was all for Joyce for when she comes round. We can show her the children were loved and that they brought love into our lives,' the 54-year-old added. 'I don't want her to see sad pictures. They were baptised on the day they were born as we knew that was what Joyce had wanted.' After the party, Mr Bennett and his wife dressed the babies in the clothes their mother had chosen to take them home in. 'She had packed her suitcase for the girls already as she was so organised. 'Each had a pink vest with the slogan 'Born in 2014', Melody wore a pale pink shade, whilst Rose had a brighter one. 'They both wore a babygro with a teddy bear on the front. Once the girls were dressed and ready, they were taken over to Joyce so she could have special time with her twins. 'We wrapped them each in blankets that had been put on Joyce.' The grandparents then left the babies with their father, Kevin Clarke, before their deaths. Speaking of the day her daughter was left for half-an-hour in agony, she said: 'She phoned me very early in the morning to say she was in a lot of pain. 'We quickly established it wasn't labour but knew it wasn't right and I told her to call 999. The tower block where Ms Bennett lives. Neighbours did not answer their buzzers when paramedics rang to gain access to the building, forcing them to phone the police to be let in . Ms Bennett and her partner Kevin Clarke (left) have one child together. The mother's father, Joe Bennett (right) said the decision to turn off the babies' life support was one he would have to live with for the rest of his life . 'I said would head over there straight away on foot. 'I started off and Joyce managed to call emergency services. The crews passed me on the way and saw me dashing along but obviously didn't know I was Joyce's mother. 'When they got there, they couldn't get her to open the door and the police officer smashed through panel so they could get in. This is the tragic timeline that shows it took paramedics some 30 minutes to reach Jocelyn Bennett after she called 999 after suffering severe stomach pains. 'I arrived just as they were doing that. When we got into the flat she was semi-conscious on the bed and was in so much pain. She wasn't really with us at all and was drifting in and out of consciousness. 'By this point Joyce wasn't talking or responding to anyone. All I could see were her lips turning blue and she wasn't breathing.' Previously Mr Bennett said neighbours in the block of flats refuse to answer their buzzers to police following a recent raid. 'If any residents see flashing blue lights they don't answer their calls because they fear it'll be another raid. 'No one answered their buzzers when the paramedics tried them. 'There are vulnerable people living in that building and the council has a duty of care for them. A better system needs to be in place. A spokesperson for Birmingham City Council said: 'We have systems to provide emergency access to our blocks for the emergency services and an urgent investigation was commissioned as soon as we were made aware of the matter.'","Joe Bennett and his family turned off granddaughters' life support this week .

"In a fitting tribute to the star of hit movie The Hunger Games, actress Jennifer Lawrence has been immortalised as a 5ft 10in-high cake. The 24-year-old star was the inspiration for the incredible winning entry at last week's Cake International contest in Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre. Lara Clarke, from Walsall, took two-and-a-half months preparing her masterpiece for the baking competition, with the sponge cake requiring 150 eggs, 22lb of flour and 22lb of butter.

"The mastermind behind two hit Call of Duty games has been asked by a former Pentagon official to help policy advisors imagine future wars America may have to fight. Dave Anthony, whose blockbuster gaming franchise has earned billions of dollars, is among a group of writers and producers enlisted by the Atlantic Council to look at how armed conflicts might evolve in the 21st Century. The initiative, The Art of Future War Project, which launches this week, was born when Steven Grundman, a former Pentagon official now at the Atlantic Council, found himself impressed by the story line of a video game his son was playing. Scroll down for video . The mastermind behind two hit Call of Duty games has been asked by a former Pentagon official to help policy advisors imagine future wars America may have to fight. Pictured is a scene from Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, due out in November . The game, Call of Duty: Black Ops II, depicts a cold war set in 2025 between China and the United States, with the rival powers vying for coveted rare earth elements. 'He was struck how realistic our portrayal in Call of Duty: Black Ops II was of a future conflict,' Anthony told AFP in an interview. To come up with that game's plot, Anthony gathered an eclectic group that included screenwriter David Goyer, who worked on the Batman films; author Peter Singer who has written about drone warfare; and Oliver North, the retired Marine officer turned television personality who rose to fame in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s. Former Pentagon official Steven Grundman was struck by how realistic Call of Duty: Black Ops II (pictured) was in portraying future conflicts, creator Dave Anthony said . 'You get everybody in a room like that, and all the different perspectives come together,' Anthony said from his home in Bel Air, California. 'That combination was fascinating. What I would like to bring to Washington is that kind of thinking.' The British-born Anthony, 41, said there is no shortage of scenarios outlining future threats to the United States, with a plethora of experts, books and films forecasting dangers on the horizon. 'The problem is we're not preparing for it. And the government is not set up to prepare for it. That's what I want to question. 'What can we do about that?' Anthony said . 'The stock answers are - ""well, we don't have the money for it"" or ""we can't possibly predict what's coming next so why bother"". That's what I want to blow apart.' The Atlantic Council said it had sought out Anthony because national security decision makers cannot keep up with the frenetic pace of change in the world, and that 'new voices' are needed to make sense of a chaotic landscape. British-born Dave Anthony, 41, said there is no shortage of scenarios outlining future threats to the United States. Pictured are US Marines in Afghanistan . 'Writers, directors and producers and other artists bring to bear observations derived from wholly different experiences in the creative world,' the council said in a statement. 'They can ask different kinds of questions that will challenge assumptions and status quo ways of tackling some of today's toughest national security problems.' Instead of a power point presentation, common at think tanks, Anthony plans to show slick videos when he appears at the program's launch in Washington on Tuesday. One of them will force the audience to confront the possibility of an assault in Las Vegas similar to the 2008 attacks on Mumbai. Anthony, whose Call of Duty series has a hotly-anticipated new installment due out in November, said his experience running a multi-billion dollar production company has some parallels to government work. There are billions of dollars at stake, intense pressures and 'inflexible' thinking among corporate executives that has to be overcome. The US government and military also face a dilemma trying to adapt amid uncertainty, but Anthony argues the greatest danger is refusing to take any risks. 'The way I like to think about it is the next attack has already happened, someone has already thought of it. How do you look at all the ideas that are out there?' he said. 'The problem is the next attack is very unlikely to be the same as the previous attack.' As the US presses an air war against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, the potential danger from the militants will not come in a conventional way, he said. 'The threat may well be that you have 100 ISIL (IS) loyalists in the country, today right now as we speak, and who may simultaneously attack soft targets. 'I think this is going to be the next 9/11.' It was time to start preparing for such dire scenarios, he said. 'Why are our heads in the sand - pretending to ourselves that this won't happen on US soil? ...What could we be doing about that right now?'","Call of Duty: Black Ops creator Dave Anthony to help predict future wars .

"Illuminated in dazzling sea-greens, blues and purples and sculpted into jagged shards, these ice caves certainly do not look of this world. In fact, they are in  Russia, and the striking effect is the result of the sun's rays penetrating the glacial ice. Shaped by a hot spring that runs past the volcanoes in the Kamchatka peninsula, the water has created beautiful translucent tunnels. As it melts over the years, the layer of ice has dwindled, producing the otherworldly illuminated effect inside the cave. Planet Earth or Krypton? These ice caves near the Kamchatka volcanoes in far east Russia are illuminated by the sun's rays . Natural art: Water from hot springs sculpt the melting ice and allow outside light to shine through, creating the illuminated effect . Photographer, Sergey Krasnoshchekov, 28, waited until the summer before making the expedition but was worried that parts of the 1km cavern might collapse. Curiosity got the better of the Russian photographer, though, resulting in this extraordinary collection of images. 'The caves are difficult to access as you need special off road vehicles to reach the location,' says Krasnoshchekov. Magical: The caves have been beautifully captured by photographer Sergey Krasnoshchekov . Dedicated: Sergey spent a few days at the remote caves, which require an off-road vehicle to access . 'I spent a couple of days near the caves but not too much time inside. I was afraid the roof might collapse as its so close to an active volcano. 'But it in the end I couldn't resist the opportunity to go and take some pictures and just went for it. 'The colours inside the cave are truly stunning, it feels as if you are in another world when you step inside,' he adds. 'It takes your breath away': Krasnoshchekov reveals that his group were stunned into silence by the jaw-dropping scenes . Fearless: The 28-year-old ignored concerns that the caves may collapse to get the shots . 'There was a stunned silence as we all walked in, the colours are so blue and bold it really takes your breath away. 'The cave looks this way because of the sun rays trying to push through the ice, I have never seen anything like it before. It was very cold inside but I was so caught up in the moment that I barely noticed, in the end I didn't want to leave.' The photographer has also captured volcanic eruptions in the Kamchatka peninsula, which is home to a large cluster of over 100 volcanoes, some of which are included on the UNESCO World Heritage List.","Photographer Sergey Krasnoshchekov captured caves in the Kamchatka peninsula, far east Russia .

"A school is having food delivered by taxi to comply with Nick Clegg's free meals policy. Under the £1billion Coalition scheme introduced last month, all pupils aged four to seven must be given lunch. Lacking adequate facilities, Sheepscombe Primary is paying a driver to bring in cold meals such as bagels from a nearby secondary. Sara Bennion, headmistress of the 33-pupil school near Stroud in Gloucestershire, said: 'We have tried lots and lots of ways to provide the hot meals. It has become quite problematic because obviously we want to be working towards hot food.' Pieter-Jon Alliss from Country Cabs pictured delivering the school meals to Sheepscombe Primary . Sheepscombe Primary (pictured), in Gloucestershire, is struggling to adhere to the free school meals policy . She said the meals policy was proving a strain on the school's finances. The Government provides £2.30 per child for a daily hot meal but Sheepscombe must pay £2.95 for the cold meal option – not including the £15 a day taxi charge. The school is making up the deficit with cash from the Small Schools Transitional Funding pot. Other schools have been reported ordering takeaway pizzas, giving pupils fruit and biscuits until late food arrives, shipping sandwiches in from pubs and seating children in classrooms and music rooms. Miss Bennion said: 'It is a great initiative but the kinks haven't been ironed out. We're hoping that negotiations with the local authority can help us find a solution.' The Liberal Democrat policy means 1.9million children can now access a free meal in reception, year one and year two. David Laws, who is the party's schools minister, has already declared the scheme a 'massive success'. Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg says giving children hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra English and maths lessons. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg pictured during the Liberal Democrats conference in Glasgow. His free school meals policy has put a strain on the finances of Sheepscombe Primary in Gloucestershire . But critics dispute these benefits and say many schools are struggling to cope. In August, the Local Government Association revealed that councils are being forced to raid other funds because they have been left more than £25million out of pocket. Last month, it emerged that children aged four were served just one chicken nugget each at a school in Birmingham. They were rationed according to their age. The city council said it was investigating the incident at the unnamed school. The Government expects pupils to be routinely offered a hot meal option. Schools not in a position to do this straight away should be working towards it 'as soon as possible'. Mr Laws yesterday denied the policy had been implemented too quickly.","Gloucestershire primary forced to pay driver to bring in students' cold meals .

"The North-South divide is blurred in Prestbury, where the multi-millionaire footballers of the two great Manchester clubs make their homes. There is a scent in the air as you drive along its sunken lanes, not only that autumnal blend of burning wood and rotting leaves — but of money. This Cheshire village, a few miles north of Macclesfield, is one of the richest places outside the South-East of England — part of a triangle of wealth formed with the nearby settlements of Wilmslow and Alderley Edge. Coleen Rooney has object to 'affordable' houses being built near to her eight-bedroom mansion in Prestbury . Coleen, wife of England and Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney, wrote an angry letter to the council about the plans . Mrs Rooney grew up in a rough area of Croxteth in Liverpool, but has objected to 'affordable' homes being built . There are some cheaper houses in Prestbury — think £900,000-plus for a four-bedroom bungalow — but very few are ‘affordable’ in the sense the Government means: ones that young couples on average incomes have enough money to buy. So when a local developer suggested building five ‘affordable homes’ as part of a small ‘executive’ development — 15 houses in total — on the outskirts of the village, it might be expected that its more fortunate inhabitants, particularly those from humble backgrounds, would be in favour of the plan. After all, Coleen Rooney, wife of Manchester United and England captain Wayne, knows what a struggle life can be. Her mum was a nursery nurse who grew up in a rough area of Croxteth in Liverpool. And today, even though the Rooneys’ home on the outskirts of the village is a mansion worth about £5 million, they must remember the days before their world transmuted into an endless round of Caribbean holidays, Bentleys — and disappointing England performances. But do they want affordable homes for people from similar backgrounds as themselves to be built near them and lived in by people not unlike themselves? Certainly not! ‘Let’s not ruin our village,’ Mrs Rooney wrote this week in a letter to her local planning authority, Cheshire East Council. ‘The development would be in direct conflict with the national policy to protect green belt land.’ She went on to warn of the dangers of increased traffic and damage to the ‘special landscape, character and appearance of the area’. In a show of support that points to the village’s unusual make-up, Mrs Rooney was supported by the wife of glam-rock band Slade’s frontman Noddy Holder. The Holders are long-standing residents of Prestbury and live on the same secluded cul-de-sac as the Rooneys. ‘Prestbury is an historic village and we need to preserve its character and setting,’ wrote Suzan Holder. On Thursday, the council planning committee threw out the offending application, though it may yet be resubmitted. All very well — except that when it comes to altering the ‘special landscape, character and appearance of the area’ the Rooneys have form. Coleen Rooney has hit out at plans to build 15 homes on Green Belt land (pictured), just yards from her £12million Cheshire mansion (circled) Mrs Rooney’s concern for the green belt, expressed in suspiciously legalistic language, is no doubt sincere. But some may be tempted to accuse her of, at best, nimby-ism and, at worst, double standards. As Richard Morris, a surveyor advising the thwarted developers Harvey Wood, says: ‘There is a contradiction. The Rooneys’ house is like a mini office building and it seems slightly strange that they should object to what is a very sympathetic development on adjoining land.’ In architectural terms, the Rooneys’ house, completed in 2005, is a sprawling, characterless pile of the kind to be seen in many a faceless gated community in America. The three-storey mansion boasts all the toys a star footballer would expect — swimming pool, Jacuzzi, gym, cinema — and all the style of one of the cheaper Las Vegas themed hotels. Grecian columns and gold bath taps are said to grace the interior — but who really knows? Outside, the 20 acres of grounds are surrounded by high perimeter walls studded with security cameras. There is nothing pretty about the house dubbed Wayne’s World, and no one in their right mind could describe it as being in sympathy with that ‘special landscape’ so treasured by Mrs Rooney. There is also the fact that it replaced a perfectly adequate and less obtrusive five-bedroom property of 1930s vintage. In this, the Rooneys represent part of a controversial trend. The golden couple’s arrival in Prestbury presaged an influx of footballers, mainly from Manchester United and Manchester City and all stupendously well-paid and able to afford rocketing asking prices. Peter Crouch, Wes Brown and Carlos Tevez have lived in the village at various times. The former England cricketer Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff is another well-known resident. Of course, it wasn’t just footballers who turned this corner of Cheshire into a British Beverly Hills, but they played their part. One by one, perfectly good houses in the Prestbury-Alderley area were torn down to be replaced by palaces of varying degrees of ghastliness. You see them as you drive around: partially hidden behind gates, walls and hedges, but still hideous — and most definitely not in sympathy with a beautiful landscape, framed in the east by the Peak District. At its height in 2008, the mansion-building splurge prompted Thelma Jackson, a veteran Conservative councillor, to call a halt. The plans, submitted to Cheshire East Council, would see five 'affordable' homes built on Green Belt land . ‘Since Wayne Rooney moved into the village it’s been a snowball effect,’ she said. ‘Some of the houses do need pulling down, but the houses they’re building to replace them are just so huge. They are going up to three storeys high. It’s destroying the character of the village.’ The style of the new homes has not been the only issue — their inhabitants’ behaviour continues to draw criticism. Don Foden, a member of Prestbury Parish Council, says that the footballers ‘don’t take part in the village. They live behind locked gates; they close themselves off from day one.’ There is also suspicion over their enthusiasm for the knock-downs and rebuilds. Building costs on new homes are not subject to VAT, which would add 20 per cent to the bill. ‘There is another story to this,’ says Mr Foden. ‘If you modernise a house, you pay VAT on it; if you build a new house, you don’t. So there is a financial advantage to knock-down and rebuild over renovation.’ There is, of course, an argument that such wealthy residents must bring much-needed funds to what could be a sleepy country village. But stroll down Prestbury’s pretty High Street, past the parish church towards the Admiral Rodney pub, and there are a disturbing number of For Sale and To Let signs adorning empty shops and offices. ‘Footballers and celebrities tend to spend their money out of the area rather than in it,’ says Bill Livesley, a member of Cheshire East Council. While he says Coleen Rooney does occasionally use the local Co-op — as does Freddie Flintoff — in his eyes, Prestbury has altered over the past 10 or 15 years. ‘I do appreciate it’s difficult for Wayne Rooney to walk up and down the street because he gets people coming up and asking him for autographs. ‘People like him live a more protected life. But, unfortunately, it is changing the village. It’s changing it away from a community.’ The actor Charlie Lawson, who plays Jim McDonald in Coronation Street and runs a farm shop in the village, begs to differ. Other well-known residents do contribute to local life, he says. Coleen Rooney, pictured on another holiday in Barbados, where she and Wayne own a second home, objected to the plans because she believes the new builds would 'ruin' her village . ‘Coleen and her husband support the village shops and, when they’re around, they go to the local Indian restaurant,’ he says. ‘Freddie Flintoff comes in our shop most days and he drinks in the pub. [Former footballer turned BBC pundit] Robbie Savage shops with us. [Sunderland player] Wes Brown shops with us, as does the wife of [Manchester City captain] Vincent Kompany.’ As for the Rooneys’ stubborn stance on the housing plans, he says: ‘It’s not nimby-ism — they have every right to object.’ Maybe, but it may seem to outsiders like one planning law for some and another law for others. Certainly, those who live in the shadow of the vast new mansions find it impossible to ignore the area’s celebrity status. ‘We who have lived here for a long time are both amused by it and morbidly fascinated by it, but it also intrudes into our daily lives,’ says John Wallace, a resident of Alderley. ‘I’m sure it keeps property prices high and provides employment — but then you have the house building.’ The strength of feeling even prompted him to write a poem about it, which has been published on the website of the local residents’ group. Naming no names, the verses describe ‘a house like an office block’ — a vast concrete- and-glass monstrosity surrounded by gates and ‘walls like Stalag Luft Eleven’. The problem, of course, it that ‘though neighbours think it’s as ugly as sin, a footballer thinks that it’s heaven’.","Coleen Rooney slammed plans to build 15 homes next to her mansion .

"Athletes could perform better if they choose to get physical in the bedroom the night before a performance instead of getting involved in complicated exercises where they have to use their brain. A new study from Swinburne University in Melbourne has shown that runners didn't reach their peak if they had undertaken cognitive tasks beforehand. Dr Clare MacMahon's research suggests that your brain should be rested before physical activity. Taking on cognitive activities before exercise can decrease your performance . Runners could be better off having sex in the bedroom that using their brain the night be a perforamance . Dr MacMahon, who was working with German researchers, came up with this theory after putting 20 German runners to the test to investigate the effect of cognitive fatigue on physical performance. The experienced runners performed two 3,000-metre runs on an indoor track, once after cognitive fatigue, and the other under non-fatigued conditions. Before the second run, the participants had to press the relevant keys on a keyboard as they appeared on the screen for 90 minutes - while another group watched documentary, The Age reported. The group who participated in the screen exercise ran slower than the group watching TV. Completion times were 'significantly slower' in the cognitive fatigue condition, the paper titled Cognitive fatigue effects on physical performance during running, stated. 'Specifically, cognitive fatigue increased the perception of exertion, leading to lesser performance on the running task,' the report said which was published in the Journal of Sport & Exercise Psychology. 'While previous research has examined the impact of cognitive tasks on physical tasks, this is the first study to examine a self-paced physical task, showing that cognitive activity indeed contributes significantly to overall performance.' 20 German experienced runners participated in the Swinburne University research . Would reading a book about sex increase or decrease your performance?","Study, from Swinburne University in Melbourne, shows runners perform better if they don't undertake cognitive activities .

'The toy is Paddy’s favourite and he is so playful he flipped it up in the air hoping that Keva would join in and play with him. 'Keva obviously saw it move quickly and Bosc Monitors are used to catching food in the wild so he stretched up and grabbed it. 'He swallowed it down no problem at all.

"There were hundreds of them living in the brothel, and when the men came they could do nothing but run. The sex workers of the 200-year-old Kandapara brothel in Tangail, Bangladesh were forced to flee for their lives when a mob, backed by the local government, came armed with drums of petrol and threatened to set brothel  on fire in July this year. The mob cut off the electricity and gave the sex workers two hours to vacate or they would burn to death. Now, months later, many of the Kandapara prostitutes have moved to other brothels, while others have had no choice but to remain in Tangail, where they live in hiding, under constant threat from local residents. Although many still take clients in secret, four former Kandapara girls have been killed since the July eviction, and the women who remain fear for their safety without the protection of the brothel. Broken lives: Former Kandapara brothel sex workers Razia Khatoon, 50, and Nilupa Yasmin 26,  look on as Asma Reyamoni, 13, born in the brothel, tends to Nilupa's son in her home in Tangail, Bangladesh . Born in a brothel: Asma was born into the Tangail brothel where her mother worked. She has stopped attending school in town because the students harassed her over her mother's work . Changes: Shazia, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, 48, walks through the medical clinic where she works part time as a maid. She was sent to Kandapara by her parents at a young age to work as a maid, and became a sex worker when she got older. 'I liked the environment and the people, day by day it turned into a habit for me and I enjoyed it.' she says. She lost all of her possessions in the eviction and now makes ends meet by taking one or two clients a week in secret . Nowhere else: Asma, the teenage daughter of a sex worker, plays with her neighbour Nilupa's son in Tangail, where many sex workers have remained since they were evicted living in secret under threat from local residents . Unstable future: Nilupa, seen with her two young sons, ran away from her parents when they tried to force her into marriage, and was found by a pimp who sold her into the Tangail brothel. Her madame beat her when she protested and tried to leave. She doesn't plan to continue working as a sex worker, 'I want to live a decent life for my kids now' she says . Government distributed condoms are seen scattered outside the demolished Kandapara brothe, which had been in the neighbourhood for 200 years before it was destroyed . Born into prositution: Taslima, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, 40, was born into the brothel, her mother started working there when she was only 12 years old. 'When you're born into a brothel you have to be a sex worker' Taslima says. She started working as a sex worker when she was ten years old. She says the Tangail brothel was good, there were lots of NGOs helping them and she was able to live very independently, making up to 7,000 taka ($90) a week. Now she only makes up to 3,000 taka ($38) a week. 'I'm always scared when I take calls. Since the eviction some girls have taken a call for one man and there have been 5 or 6 when she gets there. If the government know that I'm living here they will murder me.' Taslima says . Living in fear: Razia, seen laughing with 13-year-old  Asma, used to be the Kandapara brothel's madame. Since the eviction she hasn't been able to work at all and is afraid that the townspeople will find her out and beat her . Destroyed: The demolished Kandapara Brothel in Tangail, Bangladesh, where hundreds of prostitutes lived and worked until July . Family: Parvin Shanti Akhter, 37, sitting with her daughter Asma, was married when she was 13 years old. After three years she ran away from her husband because he beat her, and she met a man who sold her into the brothel. Since the eviction she says 'We live like dogs, we can't even afford to eat. It's really hard, we're just breathing now. Sometimes I can't even find one client a week.'  She says that four girls have been murdered when they went to client calls and she's terrified every time she takes a client, adding that 'the townspeople have threatened to burn us alive if we show our faces in town' No hope: Maya, 35, he was very young her parents got divorced and re married, and her father and mother's new spouses didn't want to take her in. She started working for a garment factory when she was 12 years old, and it was there that she met a man who promised her a better job with more money, and he sold her into a brothel. Three times she tried to escape from the brothel and each time the local police or local men caught her and brought her back to her madame for reward money. 'Life in the brothel was not so good. I didn't want to stay there but I was helpless and had nowhere else to go' Former Madam Razia ran away from an abusive husband and ended up in the brothel when she was 20 years old. She says that it was a good environment, the girls were nice, it was safe, and she made good money . Hidden: Joya, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, 30, (left)  was only ten when a women picked her off the street and sold her into a brothel. Her mother eventually located her but her madame threatened to kill her and she left. Since the eviction she has been living in secret in town, fearing for her life if her neighbors find out she used to work in the brothel . No more crying: Bulboli, 25, says 'there are no tears left now'. 'I'm all alone. I don't go anywhere and I can't go back to my parents.' When Bulboli was ten, a man picked her off the street and sold her into a brothel. She eventually ran away and picked up clients independently, but went back to the brothel for safety. She used to make up to 1,000 taka (around $13) a day in the brothel, but now makes 1,000 taka (around $13) every two weeks. 'It's very hard to survive on 500 taka a week. Sometimes I only eat one meal a day' New life: Maya, pictured hugging her daughter hasn't worked once since the eviction and has a hard time providing for her child .","A mob backed by local government evicted hundreds of prostitutes in Tangail, Bangladesh, this summer .

"You're only as old as you feel: Kim Il Sung, founder and 'Eternal President' of North Korea, who had some wacky ways of trying to maintain his youth . North Korean revolutionary leader Kim Il-sung would take blood transfusions from men and women in their 20s and spend hours watching children playing in a bid to live to 100, his former doctor said. The efforts by the Democratic People's Republic's 'Eternal President' were in vain, he died in 1994 at the age of 84, two years after his personal physician defected to South Korea. They have been revealed amid rumours his grandson, Kim Jong-un, the current North Korean leader, had gone for a gastric band operation in China to counter an addiction to Emmental cheese. Kim So-yeon, Kim Il-sung's doctor, told CNN the health issues apparently affecting the younger Kim could be similar to those suffered by his grandfather. Both the Kim Il-sung and his son Kim Jong-il, the current Kim's father, suffered diabetes, heart problems and stress, said Dr Kim, conditions she believes may have been passed on. She also speculated that Kim has been receiving hormone shots to make him look more like his grandfather, who is a revered figure in North Korea. Before she defected, Dr Kim spent ten years in charge of research at a 'Longevity Centre', where scientists researched and experimented with new methods to keep Kim Il Sung young. In his later years, she said, he favoured blood transfusions from citizens in their 20s, believing the young blood would help his body to last longer. After the centre decided happiness brings good health, Kim also took to watching children do funny or cute things that would make him laugh. 'He wanted to rule as long as he could. I think he wanted to live a long life for his own satisfaction,' said Dr Kim. Her revelations come shortly after Kim Jong Un made his second public appearance in a week following a period of over a month during which a lack of sightings had prompted speculation about his health and grip on power. The newly released photos show the rotund leader and wife Ri Sol-Ju meeting with gold medalists from the recent Asian Games and their coaches in Pyongyang. Kim, 31, was wearing his signature dark buttoned suit, although there was no sign of his black walking stick although in one photo it looked as if several of the athletes were having to help him stand up straight.

The 17th Asian Games was held in Incheon, South Korea, from September 19 to October 4. North Korea finished seventh in the medals table, winning 36 in total and 11 gold. After five weeks without being seen in public, Kim appeared on the front page of the Rodong Sinmun newspaper last Tuesday smiling and gesturing on a visit to a housing development, although there was no indication which day the event had taken place. Kim was surrounded by aides and supported himself with a black walking stick. Prior to that he hadn’t appeared in public since he and his wife had attended a concert on September 3.","Odd health regimen is revealed by Kim's former doctor, who defected in 1992 .

"Fit Mom Maria Kang is back with a bang in her new 2015 calendar, in which she features alongside 24 'no excuse' mothers who proudly display the efforts of their intense fitness regimes. The 33-year-old Californian rose to fame last year after she started a Facebook campaign to try and convince mothers that they shouldn't be 'proud' about flaunting their fuller figures but should instead be proactive about trimming them down. At the time the mother-of-three said: 'We need to change this strange mentality we are breeding in the U.S. and start celebrating people who are a result of hard work, dedication and discipline. Scroll down for video . 'Don't give up': The group offers support to women who are struggling to find a balance between motherhood and their health . Motivator mom: Maria Kang wants to encourage other mothers to be more proactive about their health and fitness rather than making excuses because of their children . Firm believer: A number of women such as Gabriela Davila, pictured with her four sons, follow Maria's healthy lifestyle routine . 'I’m not bashing those who are proud and overweight, I am empowering those who are proud and healthy to come out and be the real role models in our society.' Maria - who was accused of ‘fat shaming’ when she posted an image of herself looking trim and toned in her workout gear, along with the caption ‘what’s your excuse?’ - has since said that it was not her intention to hurt people, but rather just to tell the truth. As a result of the incredible reaction to her campaign, the fitness-focused entrepreneur founded a non-profit organisation aimed at encouraging mothers to take a more active interest in their personal health and exercise routines. 'The No Excuse Mom Group is a group of moms focused on growing healthily, connecting our community, leading our youth and supporting each other,' Maria writes on her website. 'We have free workout locations throughout the world. We have life, stress, work, kids, responsibilities and obligations. 'We struggle making time for workouts, we splurge on cookie dough and enjoy (and often need) a glass of wine. That’s life. And that’s completely okay. Balance is one of the keys to success.' Fitness is fun: No excuse mom Jenny Mire prefers planks as her toning activity of choice . Happy families: Stay-at-home mom Stephanie Navarro believes that 'sweat is magic' The calendar, which is on sale on the group's website for $14.99, includes a whole host of nutrition tips, exercise ideas and time management suggestions, as well as four home workouts created specifically for hard-working mothers to fit into their day-to-day schedules. Each of the women featured are, according to Maria 'real, every day moms who transformed themselves through fitness'.

"The future of virtual reality took a very real - and large - step forward yesterday in an unlikely corner. Marriott hotels has unveiled a new travel booth in New York  where guests can explore the black sand beaches of Hawaii or the top of London's Tower 42, without buying so much as a bus ticket. In one of the first premium virtual reality applications outside of the gaming and entertainment industry, Marriott is taking the immersive experience to new heights by allowing users to feel sensory elements such as heat, wind and mist  as well as seemingly 'seeing' new locations in front of them. Scroll down for video . Two  virtual reality booths that transport users to a Hawaiian beach or the top of London's Tower 42 . The ‘Teleporter’ is made using Oculus Rift technology and is child’s play to use. Users stand in a phone-booth like structure, put on a virtual headset and wireless headphones, and then are ‘teleported’ to the destination for a 100-second 'experience'. Built-in 4D technology means the user physically feels different parts of the environment, such as temperature and moisture. Wish you were here? Maui in Hawaii, where you can be transported to thanks to new technology by Oculus Rift . There’s pneumatic pumps embedded in the booth's floor, misting nozzles in the walls, heat fans in the ceiling and floor, a ‘scent dispenser’ and a 1000-watt amplifier. Once you  virtually ‘land’ on the beach, pumps in the floor create the cushioned feeling of sand, users feel 80-degree warmth against their skin, a gentle sea breeze and ocean mist. The brand has partnered with Relevent, who brought on board Academy Award-winning Framestore - the company who engineered ‘Ascend the Wall’, a Game of Thrones virtual reality experience that lets you ascend the infamous Wall from the series - to develop the booth's visual effects. New York's Marriott Hotel unveiled the new technology and it will travel to other locations throughout November . ‘Marriott needed to build credibility with younger travelers,’  Michael Dail, the company’s VP of global brand marketing told Wired. ‘The tech has been there for a while, the application has been there, but now that it’s becoming accessible and mainstream, we wanted to be the first to jump out there. ‘We wanted something more immersive, more experiential, that helps people connect with that feeling of what travel is really about.’ Tower 42:   'teleporter' can show you the dizzying heights from the top of London's seventh tallest skyscraper . Earlier this year, online virtual website Second Life CEO Philip Rosedale said that it won't be too long before people purchase virtual reality property for their own homes. For now, the Teleporter  will be travelling around the US at selection locations throughout November. Marriott hope this is just the beginning. If someone is planning to go on holiday, they could use this technology to check out different locations before booking. Dail said: ‘We want to take things to the next level and we are thinking ahead about the future of travel.’","Marriott hotel brand unveils  Oculus Rift technology in New York .

"Tragic: Alison Holman, 34, was found dead on May 7 in her home in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester . A young mother hanged herself in a drunken 'cry for help' after her addiction to red wine destroyed her ten-year marriage and saw her separated from her sons, aged five and nine. NHS worker Alison Holman, 34, was found dead on May 7 in her home in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, with empty bottles of wine strewn about the property. The health improvement officer had split with her husband in November 2013 after her drinking habit became out of control - she would often finish two bottles of wine in one evening, an inquest heard. Despite managing to hold down her job as a health improvement officer, instructing volunteers and teaching disabled children, she was unable to curb her addiction. At a hearing in Stockport, a coroner ruled that Mrs Holman was too drunk to have intentionally taken her own life. Afterwards her mother Julie Iddon said: 'It's just very sad and was a cry for help because Alison had clearly crossed that fine line of being able to quit drinking at will. 'People need to know even more about the dangers of drinking and how it can affect you. I wish I knew the answer to what she was thinking but I don't. I just always believed she didn't intend to take her own life so I'm pleased that's come out at the inquest.' Scroll down for video . Mrs Holman's habit began when she started drinking a glass of wine every night after work, claiming that it helped with work-related stress - an issue she saw her doctor about in 2007. Then in 2012 she was referred by her GP for depression after admitting that she had been drinking excessively since 2008. In July 2013 she was seen by the alcohol liaison service and split up with her husband later that year. Mr Holman, a software developer, said: 'We separated in about November 2013. Part of the reason was her drinking had increased. She was drinking a lot. 'Cry for help':  Mrs Holman's devastated mother, Julie Iddon, said at the inquest into her daughter's death: 'People need to know even more about the dangers of drinking and how it can affect you' 'That had been the case for quite a long time. It got to the stage that when she got home from work she would have one or two bottles of wine per night. 'The separation had not been intended to be permanent but things became more difficult.' He said he last saw her for lunch on May 7, the day she died, where 'her frame of mind was fine' and she was excited about going on a training course with work. But later he received a phone call from a friend telling him to go round to see her. Mr Holman added: 'She had been saying she wanted to kill herself. I rang her straight away and it was hazy but I got the impression she wanted to kill herself. 'She was saying she was going to kill herself and I was saying ""you have two lovely kids, why would you even do that?"" 'She was saying ""they don't need me"". I decided to go round with the kids but at that point she did manage to convince me she was fine and I didn't need to go round. 'She assured me she was fine and she was going to bed.' The hearing was told how Mrs Holman began a relationship with NHS volunteer Wayne Oldham after he met her on a course she was taking. On the day she died the couple had been in an argument over her helping him with his CV. Mr Oldham said that he left her home on May 7, aware that she had drunk two bottles of wine, and that he did not speak to her for the rest of the evening - leaving his phone on silent. Addiction: Mrs Holman was said to be drinking up to two bottles of red wine every night when her husband left her in November 2013 . When he woke the following day he had 11 missed calls and eight texts from Mrs Holman with one at 5.31pm saying: 'Considering the best way to kill myself.' Mr Oldham added: 'I just thought they were drunk texts.' Angela Lockley a close friend of Mrs Holman, also had contact with her on the day she died. She said: 'She put a Facebook status saying she was feeling down. I texted her saying ""are you okay?"" and she said ""no, I want to die"". 'She said ""everything"" was wrong. I told her to focus on her children but she said ""they don't want me, they want to be with their dad."" I rang her and she was crying and seemed very drunk.' Miss Lockley told Alison to go to hospital but she refused. They kept talking and soon the conversation was said to have eased off as the pair began laughing and joking. She added: 'She mentioned in the morning she had a session teaching a group with learning difficulties. I said ""promise to call me in the morning on your way to work"".' When Wayne Oldham was informed by the college that Mrs Holman had not turned up for work the day after their argument he decided to go round to the house. When he got no answer at the door he climbed through a bathroom window and discovered her body. Police later found an empty wine glass on her coffee table, an empty wine bottle by a bin and six other empty bottles in a kitchen cupboard. Tests showed Mrs Holman, who did not leave a suicide note, would have been three times over the drink drive limit. Recording an open conclusion coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'The alcohol intoxication might well have been a contributing factor in her state of mind. We know she had some difficulties with the separation but she wasn't somebody who had a history of self-harm. 'I suspect the level of alcohol has contributed to the action she has taken. I'm not sure she intended to take her own life. She was having a very difficult time and feeling quite low and maybe it was a cry for help. I don't think there is the evidence to say she intended to die. 'I think this is a young woman under the influence who was having a very difficult time and feeling quite low and impulsively acted on those feelings resulting in her death. In a logical, more rational mind, she could see there was more to live for.'","Alison Holman, 34, of Greater Manchester, had two sons, aged five and nine .

"For an Upstate New York woman, what started as a night filled with Halloween fun ended in the back of a police car. Twice. Catherine Butler, 26, from Rochester, made two trips to a police station Saturday on charges of driving while intoxicated in a span of three hours, both times dressed as a zombie. Ms Butler was returning from a Halloween party at around 2am on Saturday when she was pulled over by police on Buffalo Road in Gates for allegedly driving without headlights. Scary behavior: Catherine Butler, 26, from Rochester, New York, pictured in her booking photo in a zombie makeup, was arrested twice on DWI charges in a span of three hours after leaving a Halloween party . Bloody good time: Prior to her arrest, Butler had attended the Zombie Prom party at BLU Bar and Grill . A Breathalyzer test showed that her blood alcohol level at the time was .11 per cent, according to police, which is above the state legal limit of .08, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported. She was hauled off to the local police station and photographed for a mugshot, which shows the teary-eyed blonde sporting spooky zombie makeup, complete with smears of fake blood on her face and neck. A friend later picked up Butler and drove her home. But less than three hours later, the Halloween reveler was stopped a second time by a different officer after she was allegedly spotted swerving in and out of her lane on the same street. Sequel: Butler, seen here wearing the same outfit she had on during her arrest, was released to a friend the first time around, but she was pulled over again just three hours later . Police say the 26-year-old was still wearing the same costume she had donned Friday night to attend the Zombie Prom party at BLU Bar and Grill in Gates. Dark past: Butler had been arrested twice before on DWI charges, including in 2011 (pictured) Although Butler had somewhat sobered up since her first arrest, police say her blood alcohol level still slightly surpassed the legal limit, earning her a second DWI charge. Ms Butler had had other run-ins with the law in the past. She was arrested on DWI charges in 2006 and 2011, but those counts had been reduced to impaired driving. On Saturday morning, she was driving with a valid license. 'That's four driving while intoxicated arrests that she's been involved in. I don't know what it's going to take to get people to stop driving under the influence,' Gates Police Chief James VanBrederode told Time Warner Cable News. Butler is now facing two counts of DWI, along with fines for driving without headlights and failure to maintain lane. She is due back in court November 18.","Catherine Butler, 26, initially arrested early Saturday after leaving Zombie Prom party in a Rochester, New York, suburb .

"Three Somali pirates were killed in a fight over the ransom paid to free Michael Scott Moore, the German-American journalist freed this week after two years and eight months of captivity. Local police said gunfight broke out in the central town of Galkayo late last night when some of the pirates who held Moore attacked their comrades, accusing them of conducting a secret deal with negotiators. A top pirate commander was among the three people killed, police official Mohamed Hassan said, adding that one group of pirates accused the other of betrayal. Michael Scott Moore, the German-American journalist held for almost three years for ransom by Somali pirates as he appeared during his captivity. His pirate captors have killed each other in a row over the money. Journalist Michael Scott Moore went free on Tuesday after a ransom was paid, pirate commanders said. Germany has refused to confirm if it paid the $1.6 million which pirates say they received . The clash started after one group of pirates appeared unwilling to share the cash with others, said Bile Hussein, a pirate commander in the coastal town of Hobyo, told The Associated Press on Friday. He said earlier that a ransom of $1.6 million was paid by Somali intermediaries acting on behalf of Germany. Germany's Foreign Ministry hasn't confirmed money was paid and U.S. policy forbids the payment of ransoms. The 45-year-old Moore, who holds both German and U.S. citizenship, was flown to the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, where he was said to be getting medical care after being freed in Somalia, according to Germany's Foreign Ministry. A statement issued Thursday through the German magazine Der Spiegel, for which Moore had freelanced in the past, said he was safe but not healthy. Moore was seized by pirates in January 2012 in Galkayo as he drove from the airport. Galkayao and Hobya (above) have become notorious as dens for pirates who have turned to kidnappings since international security was stepped up to stop them preying on the high seas . Just four days later, U.S. Navy SEALs rescued an American and a Dane in a nighttime raid while killing all nine of their guards. Those two had also been kidnapped in Galkayo in October 2011. Hussein, the pirate commander, said the pirates who held Moore grew tired of keeping him and were increasingly concerned the U.S. would attempt to use force to secure the journalist's freedom. The pirates had been holding out for a ransom of $5 million, he said, but decided to settle for $1.6 million offered by negotiators after a long period of silence. The towns of Hobyo and Galkayo are well-known pirate dens in Somalia and Moore was abducted around the time pirates turned to kidnappings for income after their income from hijacking ships declined as a result of armed internationals vessels conducting anti-piracy patrols off the coast of Somalia.","Michael Scott Moore was freed after two years and eight months captivity .

"Guns: Adrian Golland, 71, who had his shotgun and two rifles taken away by police after he got into a row with a vicar over a sink he installed in a church . A canon at one of Britain's most-important cathedrals had two rifles and a shotgun seized by police worried about a bitter feud with a vicar sparked by a sink. Adrian Golland, 71, a lay canon at Manchester Cathedral, became embroiled in a row with Reverend Nick McKee after installing a sink at the young vicar's church. A court heard that when Rev McKee shut the area at his St Paul's Church, worried the sink's plug socket was unsafe, Mr Golland felt his 'reputation had been trashed.' After the row descended into allegations of intimidation and recriminations, police visited Mr Golland and seized his gun collection. Now he is fighting to have the confiscated a shotgun and two target-shooting rifles returned. A two-day firearms licensing hearing at Bolton Crown Court heard that in March 2012, Rev McKee decided to shut the 'sink facility' at St Paul's Church, in Astley Bridge, Greater Manchester, deeming it dangerous. Louise Brandon, for Greater Manchester Police, said Mr Golland had got a professional electrician to install an electrical socket by the sink, but Rev McKee was nonetheless convinced it was unsafe. Mr Golland told Recorder of Bolton, Judge Timothy Clayson, that he believed Mr McKee was blaming him for problems with the project. 'My reputation at St Paul's had been seriously damaged by the closure of what was deemed to be my work,' he told the court. 'I valued my reputation and it had been trashed in the eyes of the congregation.' Mr Golland was chairman of the church's building group and served on the parochial church council, but resigned these positions as a result of the dispute. The judge, sitting with two magistrates on the appeal panel, were told that Mr Golland had meetings with senior Church of England clergy in an effort to air his grievances against Rev McKee. But the court also heard his behaviour was causing tensions within the congregation at St Paul's - with allegations of him staring at Mr McKee during services and e-mails with other church members. Despite the bad feeling, Mr Golland ignored a request by the archdeacon to stay away from St Paul's. Mr Golland explained: 'I was not prepared to be excluded from a church I had attended some 15 years longer than Rev McKee.' Unholy row: The young Reverend Nick McKee (left), of St Paul's Church, in Astley Bridge, Greater Manchester, who Mr Golland claimed was behind a vendetta campaign against him . The pensioner dismissed Miss Brandon's suggestions that the vicar had never been adversarial towards him and he was being paranoid. Instead Mr Golland claimed Rev McKee was behind a vendetta campaign against him. The court was also told that police were called to Mr Golland's home in June 2013, by his wife Carol, who claimed he had assaulted her. Mr Golland insisted that his wife of 41 years had 'exploded in a temper tantrum' after they returned home from the theatre and when he brushed past her she had fallen over. The court Greater Manchester Police had attended the family home that evening but took no further action over the alleged incident. But the firearms hearing heard that all these incidents - as well as contact from administrators at St Paul's - concerned police as they knew he owned target-shooting rifles and a shotgun. St Paul's Church: Mr Golland ignored a request by the archdeacon to stay away from St Paul's . On December 6, last year, Greater Manchester Police's firearms licensing inquiry officer David Smith visited Mr Golland and in March this year his licence was revoked. Police also served the pensioner with a 'police information notice', given to people where there are 'allegations of harassment'. The court heard church officials were still so concerned about Mr Golland that they even requested a police presence at the church annual meeting. Two officers attended the meeting on April 6, during which Mr Golland publicly raised the issue of his firearms being confiscated and asked for a statement from Mr McKee that he had never threatened violence towards the clergyman. Judge Clayson and the magistrates will now consider all the evidence from the appeal and make a judgement on October 28.","Adrian Golland, 71, felt his reputation was 'trashed' by Reverend Nick McKee .

"Inspiration: Laughlin Whiteley was just four when he was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour . A boy of seven who was given an award by Prince Harry for his brave fight against cancer has died. Laughlin Whiteley was just four when he was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour. The tumour was removed but he had to have a bone marrow transplant after he developed leukemia, a rare complication of chemotherapy. He was given the all clear in March. But his cancer returned in September, a week before the charity WellChild named Laughlin the Most Inspirational Child of The Year, an award presented to him by Prince Harry. Over the past nine weeks Laughlin’s condition deteriorated and he was given a morphine drip in a bid to ease his pain. On Saturday his parents said he had passed away surrounded by his family. His mother Andrea Poyser, 43, from Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, wrote on Facebook: ‘Pain free, fly high my angel of sunflowers. You brave strong warrior, I know you have entered heaven surrounded by love.’ Last month, national charity for sick children WellChild named Laughlin as its Most Inspirational Child of the Year. Prince Harry presented him with the award at a London hotel after the youngster received hundreds of nominations for the title. The family set up the Unlock a Life For Lockey charity this year to encourage people to sign up to the bone marrow register. The charity also set up 'The Happy Shack', a beach hut on the seafront in Walton-on-the-Naze, Essex. They offer free use of the newly fitted-out hut to families with a child who has recently been in treatment for cancer or leukaemia.

"Bladder conditions caused by excessive use of the drug ketamine are more common in the UK than any other country in Europe, according to a leading doctor. Mr David Gillatt, medical director of the Bristol Urological Institute at Southmead Hospital, said that heavy use of the drug – which gives users an out of body experience – is causing more people to lose their bladders and end up on dialysis. 'K bladder' - as it is dubbed - has forced him to remove addicts' bladders completely, he said. The Home Office has estimated there were 120,000 regular users of the drug in Britain last year. And the most recent global drugs survey conducted by MixMag magazine suggests the UK has more ketamine users than the rest of Europe. Bladder conditions caused by excessive use of the drug ketamine is more common in the UK than any other country in Europe, according to a leading doctor . Mr Gillatt said: 'Physical damage due to ketamine is almost unknown in the rest of Europe and large parts of the world even though it is used as a club drug. It's a vicious cycle for some people. 'Unless you help them break the cycle and deal with the pain, they will never come off it. 'Some people are going to turn up in the future with kidney failure too because they have been damaging themselves for so long and not doing anything about it. 'Research we've done and surveys show there's a relationship between how much you take and how long. 'If you're taking it every day and you're taking large amounts; three, four, five, six grams a day then almost everybody's got problems.' The drug is a powerful general anaesthetic which stops a person feeling pain. Small doses can make a person feel floaty and dreamy, while larger doses can give powerful hallucinations. People report they feel like they have crossed into another world, sometimes known as going 'into the K-hole'. Ketamine is a powerful general anaesthetic which stops a person feeling pain.

Extreme ketamine use can injure the bladder, causing ulcers and fibrosis, which means a stiffening and shrinking of the bladder walls.

Extreme ketamine use can injure the bladder, causing ulcers and fibrosis, which means a stiffening and shrinking of the bladder walls. The urinary tract and kidneys can also become damaged. Patients often struggle with severe pain and difficulty in passing urine, or bleeding from the bladder. One former ketamine user, a 28-year-old from Bristol who wants to remain anonymous, said his problems with the drug were so bad that he tried to take his own life. 'It's an evil drug that strips you down physically.' he said. Initially taking it with friends at clubs and parties in Bristol, it soon 'got hold of him'. He said: 'Everyone around me started getting stomach cramps and getting really ill. 'All the other drugs pretty much went out of the window. It just became a constant wanting to escape. 'I hated being me. I think I was trying to kill myself without actually giving up.' The man developed K bladder after taking as much as 15g of the drug a day. He said the pain got so bad for him that he 'woke up on the bathroom floor covered in blood, fitting because the pain had got so bad'. He added: 'I eventually got into heroin because it was the only thing that got anywhere near to easing the pain that ketamine caused.'

In a startling address - rubbished by doctors - Mr Leyonhjelm argued that smokers pay 17 times more money to the government each year than they cost the health system. Mr Leyonhjelm said politicians had 'an even filthier habit' - spending people's money on things 'that are often sillier than spending too much on cigarettes and booze'. Scroll down for video . Fiery address: Senator Leyonhjelm also described increases in tobacco excise as 'flagrant theft'. Puff: The Senator came to the defence of smokers. Deadly habit: As many as 15,000 Australians die from causes related to smoking every year. 'Ladies and gentleman, thank you for smoking...' he said. 'Your generosity to the nation's treasury is truly staggering.' He continued: 'The government collects around $8 billion in tobacco excise each year. That's a lot of cash.' 'Last year, smokers imposed $318.4 million in net costs on Australia's healthcare system. Depending on rainfall, smokers also cost the taxpayer about $150 million a year in bushfire control. 'If you do even basic arithmetic, these figures disclose that you wonderful, generous smokers, pay 17 times as much as you cost'. He argued that the true intention of smoking taxes was for the government to raise money, not to help people improve their health. Dr Steve Parnis, Vice President of the Australian Medical Association, told Daily Mail Australia the medical community was 'profoundly disappointed' with the address. 'I think it's profoundly disappointing that an elected member of the federal parliament can make such ridiculous statements,' Dr Parnis said. 'This is a case of ideology before reality,' he said. 'The fact remains that smoking kills. It's the biggest cause of preventable death amongst Australians'. He rubbished the senator's claims, telling Daily Mail Australia that the cost of smoking on the health system far outweighs the money the government rakes in with the tobacco excise. According to health authorities, around 15,000 Australians die as a result of smoking each year. Dr Parnis, who said he sees the human impacts of smoking in his ward each day, said it would be profoundly beneficial to Australia's economy for smoking rates to continue to drop. Senator Leyonhjelm was elected to the Senate last year. His ascension drew fire from some critics who claimed many voters mistook his Liberal Democratic Party for Prime Minister Tony Abbott's Liberal Party on the ballot paper. Australia was the first nation in the world to introduce plain cigarette packaging in 2012. I'd like to address my comments to the roughly 18 per cent of the Australian population that engages in a despised activity. Ladies and gentlemen, thank-you for smoking. Australian smokers contribute significantly to the pile of money that – as I noted in this place recently – other people then spend. As you well know there are many such big spenders in this parliament, as are many of the people who malign you. They don't like your habit, but in my view they have an even filthier habit: spending your money – and other people's money – on things that are often even sillier than spending too much on cigarettes and booze. Your generosity to the nation's treasury is truly staggering. The government collects around 8 billion dollars in tobacco excise each year. That's a lot of cash. Last year, smokers imposed $318.4 million in net costs on Australia's healthcare system. Depending on rainfall, smokers also cost the taxpayer about $150 million a year in bushfire control. If you do even basic arithmetic, these figures disclose that you wonderful, generous smokers pay 17 times as much as you cost. Of course, I'm aware that the justification for making you pay so much for your smoking is borne of a desire to help you quit and to improve your health. However, every now and again the mask slips. Tony Abbott – in one of those 'unguarded moments' while in Opposition – made the following comment in relation to the then Government's tax hikes: . 'It would only be raising $5 billion dollars or so if people are to continue to smoke, so let's not listen to this palaver about health. This is all about revenue, it's all about tax, it's all about a government that can't control its spending – that's why it hits you in the hip pocket.' Those who would tell us how to live, back this flagrant theft, not because they're prone to agree with Tony Abbott, but because they are troubled by the worrying thought that someone, somewhere, may be having a good time. Those havers of good times, smokers of Australia, are you. This is why, having banished cigarette advertising from everything from television to cinema to motorsport and even the internet, and ended the commercial cultivation of tobacco in Australia, the health mandarins have moved on to banning smoking in prisons and insane asylums. That's right, people in cages who have lost most or all of their rights are denied even this small thing. Yes, prison is meant to be punishment. But the widespread tendency to see prisons as comfortable budget hotels bespeaks a fundamental failure to grasp just what gaol means. Rehabilitation means not committing further crime, not being trained to live according to somebody else's values. The same people worry and worry about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking rates, with about half of Australia's indigenous population being daily smokers. Aborigines on income management, like prisoners, are also denied this small consolation. Racial paternalism lives on. Because the revenues versus costs figure is so lopsided, those who would tell you how to live have tried to add 'social costs' to the healthcare costs I discussed earlier. 'Social costs' take in things like smokers' spending on tobacco, and the lost productivity represented by smokers' earlier mortality. These, allegedly, represent income foregone. By that logic, deciding to work part time to increase your leisure time is a social cost, as is going on holiday. Arguments like that suggest to me the anti-smoking lobby is running out of ideas. But when powerful, well-funded lobby groups run out of ideas and arguments, unfortunately they don't fold up their lobbying tents and head home. They keep lobbying, and we've now reached the point where, thanks to their efforts, the government is about to kill the goose that lays the golden egg, handing all the lovely tax money it extorts from you over to organised crime. Australia is set to have the most expensive ciggies in the world once Abbott's extraordinary 12.5 per cent a year tobacco tax hikes – taken over from Labor – kick in. Already, in 2012, the WHO found that a pack of cigarettes cost USD14.35 in Australia. Only Norway had higher prices, at USD14.49. Following the unprecedented 25 per cent tobacco excise increase in April 2010, Treasury's post implementation review observed that: . 'The availability of illicit tobacco products (products on which taxes have been avoided) undermines the effectiveness of taxation in many countries in reducing affordability to prevent uptake and promote quitting, particularly among low income groups.' This should come as no surprise. Here's a little basic maths: if you spend $5,000 a year on tobacco, it's a bigger proportion of your income if you earn $30,000 per annum than if you earn $100,000 per annum. In the trade, that's what's known as a 'regressive tax'. And if – along with South Park's Mr Mackey – we can agree that 'drugs are bad, mmmkay', it's probably also fair to say that 'regressive taxes are bad, mmmkay.' Calling regressive taxes 'sin taxes' doesn't hide the scale of the problem. Smokers are typically poor, which makes this vast tax-take all the more perverse. It means, for example, that social planners who want to redistribute money from the rich to the poor need to increase both welfare payments and income tax rates to achieve their goals. When the 25 per cent excise increase was imposed, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service noticed an increase in seizures of illicit tobacco. In 2013, it rose to 183 tonnes, representing forgone customs duties of $150 million. Remember, that's the annual cost of putting out bushfires due to cigarettes. And it's also entirely to be expected: tobacco can't even be commercially grown in Australia. Smokers of Australia, despite your generosity, I need to apologise on behalf of the short-sighted pickers of your pockets in this place. Maybe they haven't studied any history, because if they did, they would learn that the regime controlling cigarettes is no longer one of 'legalise, regulate, and tax.' Instead, it now resembles two other regimes, regimes that were and are catastrophic failures. I'm thinking here of Prohibition and the War on Drugs. In a world where cannabis is in the process of legalisation – because illegality simply doesn't work – and where Prohibition enriched Al Capone but beggared the US Government, I think people like me need to do better by you, the smokers of Australia. I am put in mind of a constituent's comment, made to me last week. He pointed out that he valued the e-cigarettes now available because they meant he didn't smoke during the day, and also meant he didn't inflict his smoke or smell on others. However, he said he was still going to sit on his balcony of an evening, drink a glass of wine, and smoke a cigarette. He was going to continue to do this because he enjoys smoking. And that, Mr President, is his choice.","Senator David Leyonhjelm praised Australian smokers in unusual address .

"An extreme dog groomer who dyes her pets' fur, paints their nails and dresses them up in clothes and hair extensions has defended her behaviour. Daniela Forshaw, 37, spends £2,000 a month on glamming up her pet poodles and she says her makeovers are completely safe and humane. 'What the public don't realise is groomers' dogs are the best kept in country. It's not cruel. My dog is the best kept in country, just pink,' she said on today's This Morning. Pink poodle: Daniela with her pet, Venice, who she had given an extreme makeover . Colourful: The dog groomer says dyeing her dog's fur is not cruel . Daniela and her husband of ten years, Mike, share their home in Essex with five dogs. She regularly dresses up their two poodles, Milan and Venice, because she says they love the attention. However, not all the attention they receive is positive. Daniela said: 'We do get some negative reactions but when I explain to people how healthy the dog is, and what's really right and wrong and what is actually cruel to a dog, they do start to understand.' She explained how she only uses non-toxic products on her pets. Pampered: Daniela shows off another of her dogs, Milan, who wears ostrich feather hair extensions . 'Furjazzling', left, involves putting stickers on the dog's fur while Milan has also had her nails painted - but Daniela only uses non-toxic products . Happy hound: Daniela said her dogs love the attention they get being groomed . She said: 'Colouring on a dog is like tinted conditioner. It's aloe vera based so it's just like putting a deep treatment on the dog, only with colour.' She added that the nail polishes she uses to paint the dogs' nails are also non-toxic and they never try to lick it off. They also never try and eat the stickers she puts on their fur to 'furjazzle' them. A 'furjazzle' is a take on the 'vajazzle' - a beauty treatment made famous by the TV show The Only Way Is Essex. So it's no surprise that some of the stars of the show, including Jess Wright, have taken their pets to see Daniela for a makeover. This Morning presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes admire the makeover given to Milan . Look at me! The dog is given a glimpse of herself in the mirror . She set up a business as a dog groomer after giving up a stressful City job. She told This Morning presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford: 'I had spent all of my working life in investment banking and that meant working round clock. I always wanted a dog but didn't have the chance. Then I burnt myself out so I knew I had to have a career change so I took up dog grooming.' As well as making pampering pooches her day job, she also treats her own pets like royalty. They have their own bedrooms and are regularly treated to roast dinners and curries. She said: 'All our money goes on the dogs.' Dog groomer Daniela spends £24,000 a year on her doggie makeovers and she's not the only pet owner splashing out. For many, the costs continue after their beloved pet passes away. A new poll has found half of animal owners have held a funeral for their deceased pets, with one tenth of these arranging a formal ceremony to say their final farewells - at an average cost of £105. The study, conducted by www.perfectchoicefunerals.com, polled 1,608 British adults, all of whom were aged 18 or over and had owned a pet which had passed away within the past year. The poll revealed that dogs were mostly likely to have a funeral held for them after their passing, followed by cats and, in third, rabbits. Emma Simpson of perfectchoicefunerals.com said: 'There are those who may find these costs extraordinary, but to many people the loss of a pet can be just as distressing as losing a family member. What we can see from the results of this survey is that Britain really is a nation of animal lovers and some are even prepared to part with sometimes large sums of money in order to ensure that their pets are honoured in a dignified manner.'","Daniela, 37, spends £2,000 a month on glamming up her pet poodles .

"Jemima Khan's two sons have grown up in a world of immense privilege. Sulaiman Isa, 17, and Qasim, 15, will never want for material items and have a good chance of extremely successful careers ahead of them through their network of family contacts. It is is something that Jemima, a tireless campaigner for reufgees throughout the world in her role as a Unicef UK Ambassador, never fails to remind them. The 40-year-old has revealed that she is constantly aware of how lucky her children have it while she is visiting conflict zones and coming across boys who are the same age. Scroll down for video . Jemima Khan wants to raise awareness of plight of Syrian children, so she has launched the Wake Up Call selfie for Unicef . Over the last fifteen years, she has come across several instances where children are acting sometimes twenty years older than her own boys, shouldering responsibilities that would often be too much for a fully grown man. One of the first moments of realisation came when she was distributing supplies to a refugee camp in Pakistan 13 years ago. Speaking on the Lorraine show earlier today, she said: 'I met this seven-year-old boy, who was just a little bit older than my own son. 'It’s really hard not to make those comparisons. 'I’d taken tents in (to this camp) to distribute because the Pakistani government were not recognising them as refugees and allowing the aid charities to go in. 'It was during the monsoon and it was the most terrible situation. 'This seven year old boy was trying to put a 25 kilo (four stone) tent on his back and I went up to him and said, “Get one of your family members to help you, get the head of the household.” 'He explained that he was the head of the household - his mother had died in the camp, his father had died in the fighting, but more than that, he had four younger siblings that he was caring for, including a tiny baby. Jemima Khan appeared on Lorraine today to talk about her campaign . 'This 7 year old boy had taken on the responsibility of an adult and when I thought about my seven-year-old son who could barely run a bath unsupervised at that point, you see this huge difference. 'When you meet a child like that who is seven years old and has no concept of what being a normal child is like, that really affected me.' Jemima experienced a similar situation more recently, while visiting a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan. The heiress has revealed she came into contact with a teenager who was the same age as her eldest son, who made her realise how much her boys take their opportunities for granted. She said: 'I’ve just been to  the Syrian refugee camp in Jordan and the situation is very desperate. 'The child that captures my imagination is the one that is the same age as my child now, so when I was in Syria in Jordan in the refugee camp this time, there was this 17 year old boy. 'I have a 17 year old boy and a 15 year old boy now. 'This 17 year old boy - his greatest wish in life was to be able to go to school, but he was having to go to work to support his family. 'He was having to do this menial work, but he was desperate to become a civil engineer. 'He was this serious boy who doesn’t watch TV, who was quite politicised and very gentle, but all he wanted was to be able to go to school and to be able to go to university . 'And I think about my kids and how I have to employ every tactic available to get them to do their homework, how lucky they are and how complacent they are about the immense privilege that they grow up in.' These experiences are two of many that convinced Jemima to spearhead the Wake Up Call Selfie with Unicef to raise money for children in Syria. She said: 'I’ve been working for Unicef for thirteen years now, it happened after I’d been to the refugee camp in Pakistan. Tom Hiddleston and Stephen Fry have both participated in the #wakeupcall selfie . 'When I set up an appeal for those children, Unicef approached me and said that they do that in every conflict zone, so I’ve been working with them for some time. 'In terms of this (Wake Up Call selfie campaign) being about Syria, I feel that we’ve been focusing on the military heavily and I want to put the humanitarian side back into the focus. 'There are 6.5 million children who are now in real desperate need.' She is hoping that people will be inspired to get involved with the craze in a similar way to the ice bucket challenge and the no make-up selfie. She said: 'I hope it will catch on with the public, because the eye make-up challenge and the ice bucket challenge did so well. You just have to take a selfie when you’ve just woken up, post it on social media with the hashtag #wakeupcall , donate money to Unicef and then nominate three other people.' Claudia Winkleman and Nigella Lawson have also contributed pictures of themselves waking up in the morning . The campaign has been popular among celebrities recently, but has had some backlash among members of the public who have criticised the idea of fame-hungry stars wanting more exposure on social media. But Jemima defended those celebrities, revealing it is actually all her fault. She said: 'I know that people get irritated by these campaigns. They think it’s about narcissistic celebs just wanting to put pics of themselves on social media. But the truth is, what’s really unfair is most of those people who’ve done it so far have been begged by me. People like Nigella Lawson – I had to beg her to do it, she doesn’t do selfies, she just talks about cooking on Twitter. She said it was too cheesy and forced and I had to beg her to do it, so I feel really bad for them when everyone goes, “Ugh, these celebrities just want to do this to get their face on social media.""'

"A total of 651 people have arrived in Australia from Ebola stricken West Africa in the past two months. Border staff at Australia's international airports have assessed people from the four affected West African countries - Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, plus the Democratic Republic of the Congo, over fears they could have come into contact with the deadly disease. However, the government does not know how many Australians are currently in Ebola affected West Africa, a source has revealed. They explained that unless travellers register with the government’s Smart Traveller website before they fly then the government doesn't know where they are. Scroll down for video . The Ebola epidemic has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa, including Liberia (pictured), according to the World Health Organisation . The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade  confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that 60 Australians are registered on the website as being in Guinea, Sierra Leona and Liberia at the moment. Ebola screening measures are being ramped up at international airports around Australia after it was revealed eleven Australians have been tested and cleared for Ebola in recent weeks. A spokesperson for the Australian Government Department of Health said the screening process commenced on 9 August. 'As of 1 October there had been 651 people interviewed, six of whom were referred for further consideration by human quarantine officers, none of whom required any specific action to be taken,' the spokesperson said. 'Of these six, three had been to funerals in Nigeria, but none of those people had died of Ebola and two were doctors returning from West Africa. 'All 651 who were interviewed were given a pamphlet outlining the symptoms they should look out for and the actions they should take if they develop symptoms.' Cairns nurse Sue-Ellen Kovack, 57, was cleared of Ebola on Friday by initial tests after she returned from Sierra Leone with the Red Cross . Like Ms Kovack, many Australians have travelled to West Africa to provide medical and humanitarian aid for Ebola sufferers . The Australian branch of Médecins Sans Frontières told Daily Mail Australia they currently have 24 volunteers and staff members from Australia and New Zealand in West Africa . Health authorities confirmed on Friday morning that Cairns nurse Sue-Ellen Kovack, 57, has been cleared of Ebola by initial tests. The Red Cross nurse was tested for the deadly virus after she reported feeling a fever on her return from Sierra Leone where she was volunteering in the fight against Ebola. But federal Health Minister Peter Dutton says she's not the only one who has undergone testing in recent weeks. ‘Already we've had 11 cases that have presented across the country that have all been negative,’ he told AAP in Brisbane. ‘We have put in place plans in major tertiary hospitals around the country that if we do have a positive case, we will be able to deal with that case.’ Like Ms Kovack, many Australians have travelled to West Africa to provide medical and humanitarian aid. The Red Cross nurse was tested for the deadly virus after she reported feeling a fever . Ms Kovack is originally from Toronto, Canada but is living in Cairns, Queensland . The Australian branch of Médecins Sans Frontières told Daily Mail Australia they currently have 24 volunteers and staff members from Australia and New Zealand in West Africa. The chief medical officer, chief of the defence force and immigration department secretary have all advised the federal government on how to respond to the growing Ebola crisis around the world. Initial screening is now able to be done at airports and passengers on planes coming from affected African countries are being given information about the disease. ‘That provides a world-class response and is probably ahead of the game where other developed countries are at the moment,’ Mr Dutton said. Banners have now been fixed in international airports to raise awareness of the symptoms of the deadly virus, and pamphlets distributed on some flights. ‘The Australian government has put in place additional measures to address the low risk of Ebola to Australia,’ a spokeswoman for the Australian Department of Health said on Friday. All border agencies have been educated by the Department of Health to identify and quarantine any passengers presenting Ebola symptoms in flights or at airports. The Department said very few people travel to Australia from West Africa, with no direct commercial flights from any of the affected countries. Mr Dutton pointed out Ebola is not spread like flu. ‘There needs to be an exchange of bodily fluids - of blood, of vomit or diarrhoea for example,’ Mr said. Mr Dutton said the high fatality rate of around 48 per cent in the countries affected is in part due to health workers lacking the level of training of developed countries like Australia. Funeral rituals for those killed by the virus are also contributing to the spread, he said. ‘For example, bodies are washed with water, the water is then consumed by loved ones of that person who has died from Ebola,’ he said. ‘And of course there is a rapid spread as a result.’ In the US, passengers arriving from Ebola-affected countries will be getting their temperatures taken at five airports as screening measures are bolstered in the coming days.","Border staff are assessing people arriving from four West African countries - Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria .

"A nine-year-old boy who was hit by lightning as he played soccer in August has headed home in time for Christmas. Alex Hermann's heart stopped when he and two other boys were struck by the bolt on a field in Austin, Texas on August 26. He suffered burns and hypoxia, where the brain is deprived of oxygen. He was rushed to hospital, where his parents were not sure he would recover. But after showing astonishing signs of recovery and undergoing multiple skin grafts and a cardiac ablation, which corrects heart arrhythmias, doctors said he was finally ready to head home. On Friday, his family shared an image to Facebook showing him in his wheelchair grinning beside Christmas decorations inside Austin and Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas. Heading home! Alex Hermann smiles as he prepares to leave hospital. The nine-year-old boy headed home on Friday, more than three months after he was struck by lightning on a soccer field . 'Today is the day that we have been waiting for, but Alex has been waiting for it the most!' the family wrote alongside the photograph. 'For over three months, Alex has been working hard to become stronger and healthier by the day. However, he has been terribly homesick. 'It is such a relief to be able to have our whole family reunited to a new 'normal' lifestyle, despite going to outpatient therapy at the hospital, as well as various in-home therapies as well.' Speaking to ABC News, his father, Roger Hermann, said that his son had been looking forward to hugging his dog, a Catahoula Australian shepherd named Spice, and decorating the tree. 'He made me do it the first day I was home on Friday,' he said. 'He can't move his legs, but he was directing some of the ornament placement.' He added that Spice is also overjoyed to have Alex home and has been sleeping on his bed and guarding him. Battle: Alex, pictured with players and a cheerleader from the Texas Longhorns in October, suffered burns and needed skin grafts and a cardiac ablation, which corrects heart arrhythmias . Support: The family thanked friends, family and strangers who sent their good wishes to Alex . Joy: Alex, pictured before the accident, was looking forward to being reunited with his dog, his father said . It is an incredible achievement for the youngster, who was left unable to speak, move, talk or hear after he was struck by the bolt over the summer. His heart stopped and his parents and a 19-year-old coach performed CPR before paramedics arrived and flew him to the hospital. He spent three weeks at a pediatric burn center in Dallas before moving to Austin and Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas. Two other boys were also struck but were released from hospital soon after. Doctors initially told Alex's parents that they could not be sure how well he would recover and the couple feared he was brain dead. But he began showing astonishing signs of recovery, such as uttering 'Dada' as his father leaned over his bed and smiling when he heard his favorite song. Scene: The youngster was on this field to play soccer when he was struck by lightning in August. His family is now suing the youth association for $10 million to cover the boy's medical bills . The youngster still needs extensive therapy and is still unable to walk or form complete sentences, KVUE reported. Alex's parents are suing the Lake Travis Youth Association for $10 million on claims they were negligent in getting the vulnerable kids off the field amid the approaching storm. According to the family's attorneys, his suffering could have been prevented. 'Alex Hermann sustained severe and permanent damages when all of the Defendants failed to comply with the basic safety principles on weather safety when lightning is in the area,' reads the court petition obtained by the Houston Chronicle. The family has said they have no intention of hurting the league, but will likely need the money for insurance to help pay for their son's hospital bills and long-term care.","Alex Hermann  was struck by lightning in Austin, Texas on August 26 .

"A trainee hairdresser was hit and killed by a double decker bus as he fled a Lidl supermarket after being allegedly 'dared' by friends to shoplift a bottle of water. Charleigh Etherington, 16, also known as Charlie, was knocked down outside the budget supermarket in Greenwich, south east London, on Friday evening. The trainee hairdresser became trapped beneath the vehicle and was pronounced dead at the scene on Halloween night at about 5pm despite efforts by paramedics to revive him. Charleigh Etherington was staying with his grandmother and planned to leave London the day before his death . Witnesses reported he had been with friends and was seen fleeing the supermarket into busy Eynsham Drive, Abbey Wood, with a security guard in pursuit. But Charleigh's grandfather, Del Etherington, who arrived at the scene 'minutes' after the accident, said he was told the young student had paid for the bottle of water he was carrying. 'A lot of people were saying there was a receipt in the bag. 'One man said they ran out laughing. They were just larking about, mucking around like kids do … and he ran out of the shop and look what happened.' 'It was fate. He was staying up with his nan's (in Greenwich) for a couple of days and he said he was going to go home back to his mother the night before. Then he stayed.' 'He was a lovely kid. 'He was gay and had been bullied to death his whole life. My daughter (Aisha) had moved him away from London, and he comes back for a couple of days and this happens.' Charleigh lived with his mother Aisha Etherington, Del's daughter, and younger brother Alfie, 12, an hour outside London. Charleigh ran from this Lidl shop in Eynsham Drive, Abbey Wood, before colliding with a double decker . 'She's in bits, she's absolutely heartbroken. She adored her kids. They're all upset. There's no words to describe how we all feel.' Charleigh's father, Mark, lives in Herne Bay in Kent. Del, who is from Woolwich, recalled how he arrived at the scene of the accident at Eynsham Drive, Abbey Wood, shortly after Charleigh was hit by the double decker. 'I got a call and was literally there five minutes after. When I got there they were still trying to get him out in time. 'He hit the windscreen. It threw him back and he went under the bus.' Paramedics pronounced Charleigh dead at the scene minutes later, Del said. Charleigh's father Mark arrived within an hour after police 'rushed him' from his Herne Bay home. Charleigh's uncle, Richard Etherington, said he lamented for the driver of the double decker. 'I feel sorry for the poor man – it's not a very nice thing to see. He's going to have to live with that for the rest of his life.' A post-mortem has already been carried out on Charleigh's body, Del said, and his mother Aisha will identify his body tomorrow. 'Can you imagine what it's going to be like then – it'll be hell for us all.' Charleigh had been studying hairdressing at Canterbury College. Del said: 'He was really enjoying it, doing very well and he'd only two more years of the course to do.' Del added: 'It's not right for someone to go at that age, it should be someone like me who's had a long life.' Floral tributes have been left for Charleigh at the scene of the accident. 'There's thousands of flowers down there,' Del said. 'He was such a fun lad, he was typically flamboyant. 'It's going to be a huge funeral. He was very popular.' Lidl said it could not comment on the circumstances surrounding the accident because of the police involvement. The Metropolitan Police said no arrest was made at the scene. A spokesman said: 'Police were called to Eynsham Drive, Abbey Wood, at approximately 5.10pm on Friday, 31 October, to reports of a double decker bus in collision with a male pedestrian. 'Officers and London Ambulance Service attended. The pedestrian, a 16-year-old boy, was pronounced dead at the scene. 'Next of kin have been informed, however officers await formal identification. A post-mortem examination will be held in due course. 'Officers from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit based at Catford are investigating. Enquiries continue to establish the full circumstances of the incident. 'There has been no arrest.'","Charleigh Etherington was fleeing from a security guard who pursued him .

"New details emerged today about Eric Frein's 48 days on the run from police, including how the survivalist charged with ambushing a Pennsylvania state police barracks used a laptop computer to go online. According to court documents released Tuesday, state police found Frein's laptop and two storage drives inside an abandoned airplane hangar near the spot where the suspected cop killer was captured Thursday night . Frein told authorities he used unprotected Wi-Fi hotspots to connect to the Internet during his seven-week flight, documents said, raising the possibility he knew where police were focusing their search efforts each day. How he stayed connected: Suspected cop killer Eric Frein, pictured left and right after his capture last week, used a laptop and unprotected Wi-Fi hotspots to go online during his 48 days on the run . Hideout: An exterior view of the hangar within the abandoned Birchwood Resort, where Eric Frein was caught last Thursday. His laptop was discovered inside . Looking for clues: Police officers search the hanger  Frein had call 'home' during his time on the run . Humble accomodations: A dirty mattress and sheet are seen in the hangar within the abandoned Birchwood Resort . It remains unknown how he kept the computer charged. Before his capture, state police had surmised Frein was breaking into cabins and unoccupied vacation homes for food and shelter. Experts will now analyze Frein's portable computer and thumb drives for Internet search terms, email including contacts, chat and messaging service, Internet browsing history, pictures, graphics files, movie files, text or Word documents, maps, diary or journal, timeline data and historical content of the laptop. Frein was unarmed when he surrendered to US marshals in an open field near the former Birchwood-Pocono Airpark. He told police a rifle and handgun were inside the hangar, according to an affidavit. The 31-year-old survivalist and expert marksman is charged with opening fire on the Blooming Grove state police barracks September 12, killing  Cpl. Bryon Dickson and critically wounding Trooper Alex Douglass. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Frein has been assigned two public defenders. One of them, Michael Weinstein, is a former Pike County district attorney who has since gone on to a career in civil litigation and criminal defense. Victims: Frein is charged with the shooting that killed Cpl Byron Dickson (left) and seriously wounded State Trooper Alex Douglass (right) Frein is escorted by police out the Pike County Courthouse after his arraignment in Milford last Friday . Payback: Frein was shackled with handcuffs that once belonged to his alleged victim . Among his current clients is Rockne Newell, who's charged with fatally shooting three people at a municipal meeting last year. Frein's other lawyer is Robert Bernathy, Pike County's chief public defender. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for November 12. Frein was prepared for falling temperatures, wearing an Old Navy gray thermal shirt, sweater and fleece jacket on the day he was caught, along with suspenders and eastern European military pants, according to documents. He also wore a Timex watch and a silver necklace with a pendant. Earlier this week, details contained in a note left by Frein while he was on the run from police were released to the public. The note read: 'Fri Sept 12th got a shot around 11pm and took it. He droped [sic]....I was surprised at how quick. I took a follow up shot on his head/kneck neck area. 'He was still and quiet after.....Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel I took a shot at him and jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still.' 'I ran back to the jeep....I made maybe half a mile from the GL road and hit a road block. I didn't expect one so soon. It was only 15-20 min. 'I did a K turn ¼ a mile from them and pulled into a development I knew had unfinished acess [sic] road.... 'Hearing helos I just used my marker lights missed the train around a run off pool and drove straight into it. ! Disaster! 'Made half attempt to stash AK and ran.' Police later found the Jeep submerged in water. Police said they linked Frein to the ambush after a man walking his dog discovered his partly submerged SUV three days later in a swamp a few miles from the shooting scene. Inside, investigators found shell casings matching those found at the barracks as well as Frein's driver's license, camouflage face paint, two empty rifle cases and military gear. They pursued countless tips and closed in on an area around Frein's parents' home in Canadensis after he used his cellphone to try contacting them and the signal was traced to a location about 3 miles away. At times police ordered nearby residents to stay inside or prevented them from returning home. Trackers found items they believe Frein hid or abandoned in the woods — including soiled diapers, empty packs of Serbian cigarettes, an AK-47-style assault rifle and ammunition and two pipe bombs that were functional and capable of causing significant damage. They also discovered a journal, allegedly kept by Frein and found in a bag of trash at a hastily abandoned campsite, that offered a chilling account of the ambush and his subsequent escape into the woods. The journal's author described Dickson as falling ""still and quiet"" after being shot twice. Pennsylvania State Police SWAT officers stand by as Eric Frein arrives at the Pike County Courthouse for his arraignment in Milford October 31.  Frein, was captured seven weeks after an ambush outside a barracks in northeastern Pennsylvania . Survival skills: Frein, 31, was prepared for falling temperatures, wearing a thermal shirt, sweater and fleece jacket on the day he was caught . Police spotted a man they believed to be Frein at several points during the manhunt, but it was always from a distance, with the rugged terrain allowing him to keep them at bay. Police said he appeared to be treating the manhunt as a game. Authorities believe Frein had been planning a confrontation with police for years, citing information they found on a computer used by him. Thursday’s quiet takedown of Frein, who kneeled and put his hands up when marshals approached him, ended weeks of tension and turmoil in the area, as authorities at times closed schools, canceled outdoor events and blockaded roads to pursue him. Frein has been charged with first-degree murder, homicide of a law enforcement officer, attempted first-degree murder, possession of weapons of mass destruction, discharging a firearm into an occupied structure and reckless endangerment.","Eric Frein, 31, was arrested last Thursday when he surrendered to US marshals in an open field near former Birchwood-Pocono Airpark .

"Roma defender Leandro Castan has had neurosurgery that successfully removed a malformation on his brain, the club have said. Castan has been out of action since a September victory at Empoli, where he was substituted at halftime because of dizziness.

However, he will remain in intensive care for 24 hours. The 28-year-old center back joined Roma in 2012 from Corinthians in his native Brazil. In the last two seasons, Castan played in 66 of Roma's 76 Serie A matches.

"Goal-line technology will be introduced to the Bundesliga from next season after it was approved by the majority of clubs in the German top flight. The technology chosen is the Hawk-Eye system, which is also used by England's Premier League. German football league president Reinhard Rauball said 15 of the 18 Bundesliga clubs voted for the new technology, meeting the two-thirds majority requirement. Goal-line technology will be introduced to the Bundesliga five years after Frank Lampard's goal against Germany that was not given during the 2010 World Cup . German Football League president Reinhard Rauball said 15 of 18 Bundesliga clubs voted for the technology . The Bundesliga will use the same hawk-eye system that is used in the Premier League . Thursday's vote ended longtime opposition to the technology, mostly on cost grounds. An earlier attempt to approve the technology failed in March but the proposal was tabled again by Bayern Munich after the German Cup final in May against Borussia Dortmund. Bayern won the match 2-0 and benefited from a wrong decision, when Mats Hummels' strike was not given although the ball had clearly crossed the line before being kicked out by Bayern defender Dante. In the May vote, 24 of the 36 clubs in the first and second division voted against the project. This time, only the top-tier clubs voted and the system will be used at first-division stadiums. The league picked the cheaper Hawk-Eye system over two German technologies, including GoalControl, which was used at the World Cup in Brazil.","The Hawk-Eye system  was voted for by 15 of the 18 Bundesliga clubs .

"A US airline has become a laughing stock on Twitter after it repeatedly addressed an unhappy customer as ‘Mr Human’ in a letter of apology. Florida journalist Chris Chmura exposed United Airlines’ embarrassing gaffe after the Chicago-based carrier responded to his complaint with a standard template email that they had failed to personalize. The airline’s customer care department did not  address Mr Chmura by his name and instead referred to him as ‘Mr Human’ on three separate occasions. Mr Chmura wrote the letter because he claims he turned up for a flight home to Houston and it had left without him despite him arriving at the gate on time. He told MyFoxTampaBay.com: 'They left me behind, and I wanted to know why'. Florida journalist Chris Chmura exposed United Airlines' gaffe when he shared the image on Twitter . After posting a screen grab of the email, Mr Chmura,  who works for a Fox News affiliate in Tampa was flooded with tweets from people ridiculing the airline and poking fun at the journalist . He claims to have showed up at the gate at 7:12pm for a 7:32pm flight but the flight had already left. United's records show that the flight left the gate at 7:32pm. Mr Chmura, who works for a Fox News affiliate in Tampa, shared a screen grab of the email with his Twitter followers and the image soon went viral. The email read: ‘Mr Human, your email clearly expresses your disappointment and I would like to extend a sincere apology for any negative impression that may have been created. ‘While my reply is brief and not as detailed as I would like, please be assured that we do understand your concerns, and they have been documented for review and appropriate internal action.’ United Airlines spokesman Charles Hobart said Mr. Chmura was addressed incorrectly due to a spell check error. The airline promised to follow up with an electronic travel certificate as a gesture of goodwill. After posting a screen grab of the email, Mr Chmura was flooded with tweets from people ridiculing the airline and poking fun at the journalist. Several users pointed out that the airline’s failure to refer to Mr Chmura by name and its use of a standard template undermined its attempt at sincerity. Twitter users couldn't help themselves as they poked fun at the airline's sloppy attempt at an apology . United Airlines has promised to follow up with an electronic travel certificate as a gesture of goodwill . This is the second time in three months United Airlines has faced embarrassment for a customer care email . Twitter user Kristen Hicks wrote: ‘That doesn’t read like a generic form letter at all.’ Another user, Chris Boex, said: ‘Sincerely, Mr Robot’. While a user named Pete added: ‘Sincerely, Mr Auto Reply’. The nature of Mr Chmura's  complaint is unknown. One Twitter user 'Consumerist' took things one step further and emailed United and a number of other airlines asking them to confirm that they hadn't been taken over by robots. The American Airlines account replied, with a hint of humour: 'We assure you there has been no #robot takeover here! We're human and here to help 24/7.' United Airlines faced similar embarrassment last August when it sent a boiler plate apology to a customer but forgot to fill in the blanks and addressed the person as 'Customer Name'.

"Babysitter: Georgina Spicer, 20, of Edwardstone, Suffolk, wept as she told JPs she had only been told she was in charge of the family's one-year-old son . A babysitter was taken to court after her employer’s dog attacked the next-door neighbour and her cat. Georgina Spicer, 20, said it was unfair that she was blamed after Tizzy the Jack Russell terrier went berserk  while she was looking after its owner’s one-year-old son. She was babysitting at the home of the little boy’s mother, Cally Marsh. The mother’s two dogs – Tizzy and a spaniel – escaped when the boy opened the door to the garden. Miss Spicer, who was hanging out the washing, tried desperately to get the dogs back but they charged into the garden of neighbour Melanie Richardson. Tizzy repeatedly bit Miss Richardson – who received eight puncture wounds to her left arm. The dog then launched a ‘frenzied’ attack on her pet cat, which later died of its injuries.Spicer admitted being in charge of the dog after it badly injured Miss Richardson. Wayne Ablett, prosecuting, said Miss Richardson had to use  a stick to protect herself from the dog and needed medical treatment after the incident in the village  of Edwardstone, near  Sudbury, Suffolk. Miss Spicer, who represented herself in court, wept as she told the magistrates: ‘I was only responsible for the one-year-old. That was all I was told. ‘There was no prior arrangement for me to look after the dogs.’ The student tried to change her plea to not guilty at Bury St Edmunds magistrates’ court, and broke down and cried when she was refused permission because she had no new evidence. She said: ‘I think it’s very unfair I’m getting blamed for this. I was only the babysitter.’ Chairman of the magistrates, Marian de Bass, gave Spicer a six-month conditional discharge, explaining: ‘You must realise that at the time you were in charge of the household which included a small child and two dogs. ‘However, the garden had not been made secure and therefore the incident happened.’ Spicer was also ordered to pay £300  compensation, £40 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. An order was also made for Tizzy to be destroyed within two months. ‘This dog killed a cat, injured a person who needed medical  treatment and was known to have escaped before on several  occasions and killed a chicken and possibly more,’ the chief  magistrate said. Within those two months Tizzy must be kept on a lead and muzzle in public, or kept locked up in a secure environment. The Jack Russell is also banned from the village of Edwardstone. The court heard it was being kept in a secure kennel. After the hearing yesterday, Miss Spicer, who is studying equine sports therapy, said she wanted to warn ‘every babysitter’ of the risks of looking after a child when there is a pet in the house.

"A motherof 12 branded ‘despicable’ for walking out on her children to live with a new boyfriend insisted last night: ‘They are better off without me.’ Tabitha Nimes, 39, left her family to live 260 miles away and has now remarried. Last week her former husband Peter Saunders, 47, condemned her for abandoning the children, aged 19 months to 22 years. But Mrs Nimes claims the marriage had disintegrated and was ‘upsetting the children’. Tabitha Nimes, who left her family of 12 kids to be with her toyboy lover, says they are better off without her . Peter Saunders at home with all 12 of his children whose ages range from 22 years down to just 19 months . She said yesterday: ‘I know everybody thinks I’m an awful mum, but I walked out because Pete and I were arguing all the time. ‘It wasn’t good for the children and it made them upset. Pete’s a good dad – they’re better off without me.’ Mrs Nimes, who says she lived mostly on benefits, claims she was suffering from post-natal depression at her former home in Rhyl, North Wales, and now only sees her children every six weeks. ‘I know the little ones sometimes want their mum, but they seem to be getting on well,’ she said. ‘I want to see them more, but I don’t want to cause any more family arguments. I’m trying to do what’s best for them while living my own life too.’ She and her ex-husband married in 1996 and had Rhiannon, 18, Ben, 16, Jack, 14, Josh, 13, Adam, 12, Blake, ten, Rhys, nine, Lillie, seven, Peter, six, Aston, three, and 19-month-old Beth. Mrs Nimes also has a 22- year-old son, Matthew, from a previous relationship. The mother, who married 32-year-old security guard Colt Nimes in March, said: ‘I loved being surrounded by babies. ‘I’d do the night feeds while Peter would take them to the park. Peter would do the school run while I did the housework and helped with homework.’ Tabitha has now married Cole, who works as a security guard, ending her 18 year marriage to Peter, and rarely sees her children . Peter Saunders pictured with his ex-wife Tabitha with and youngest child Beth . But she said the marriage was doomed, adding: ‘I suffered from post-natal depression and sometimes felt really down. ‘Juggling my marriage and my kids became exhausting. I wanted to lock myself away, but when I tried to tell Peter I wasn’t coping, he didn’t understand. ‘I felt he was controlling. The relationship gradually broke down and we started arguing about everything.’ In 2012, she met Mr Nimes, had another baby with Mr Saunders, and then moved from Wales to Hastings, East Sussex, with the new man in her life. The full interview appears in CLOSER magazine out today . At first, she took Aston and Beth with her because they were ‘too young to be without their mum’. She added: ‘It broke my heart leaving the other kids, but I couldn’t uproot them and I didn’t want to cause arguments. ‘Peter’s a good dad, and I knew the kids would be happy staying where they were. I didn’t tell them where I was going, but Pete told them I’d left and they seemed to cope.’ She then returned the two youngest children to their father. ‘I didn’t want to go through a custody battle,’ she said. ‘I decided I needed a clean break and felt it was best for them too.’ Last June she and Mr Nimes moved to Southampton and were married nine months later. Now living in Pontypridd, South Wales, Mrs Nimes only sees her children every four to six weeks, and has missed Christmas with them and several birthday celebrations. In an interview with Closer magazine, she said: ‘It’s upsetting seeing the kids and then having to leave them. ‘When I can, I visit and take them to the park, and last weekend we went shopping. ‘It’s hard. I miss not knowing what they’ve been up to at school, and they don’t run to hug me any more because I don’t get to see them as much as I’d like.’ Last week Mrs Nimes’s ex-husband, a convicted drug dealer who has not worked for more than a decade and receives £2,000 in benefits every month, said: ‘I don’t think the kids will ever forget what she has done. ‘It’s despicable – walking out on the whole family and leaving me to do it all on my own...how a mum can do that to her kids is beyond me.’ Their daughter Rhiannon, who is pregnant, said: ‘I’ll always love Mum but I’ll never forgive her for walking out on us … I’ve asked Dad to be my birthing partner instead. ‘I’m determined not to make the same mistakes that Mum made. I hope in time she has a change of heart and makes more effort to be there for us.’ Her mother added: ‘Sometimes I think I’m a bad mum, but I wouldn’t change what I’ve done. ‘I know my older kids are angry with me, but I love them all to pieces … I did this for them as well as myself.’ The full interview appears in CLOSER magazine out today.  Also available as a digital edition and online at www.CloserOnline.co.uk .","Married for 18 years, Tabitha had 12 children with Peter .

"'Occultists': Teacher Jake Baynes, 40, was due to stand for UKIP in next year's General Election, but has stood down amid a row with fellow members . A UKIP parliamentary candidate has resigned amid claims the party has been infiltrated by ‘occultists’. Teacher Jake Baynes, 40, was due to stand in next year’s General Election, but he has now stood down amid a row over a ‘continuous campaign’ to oust him as the candidate. His allies have pointed the finger at two ‘oddball’ fellow UKIP members who run an ‘angelic healing group’ in the Somerset town of Glastonbury. They say the pair are responsible for stirring up trouble at the local party branch in Wells. The members in question, Glen and Colleen Tucker, practise ‘alternative healing’, and work, according to their website, ‘hand in hand with the Angelic Realms, Ascended Master collective and Galactic Beings.’ They have been described as ‘oddballs’ belonging to ‘the Glastonbury occult crowd’ by one of Mr Baynes’s allies. Graham Livings, who has also resigned from his post as branch manager, said of the Tuckers: ‘They put on these weekend retreats where they guarantee the angels will be present. ‘They are oddballs. ‘The public can be very wary of that sort of thing. ‘UKIP has a prescribed list which states that no one who has been a member of the BNP or the English Defence League should be a member. ‘But when they sat down and wrote out the prescribed list, they wouldn’t have thought to put occultists down. Mr Baynes won 1,711 votes in 2010, and may have helped Liberal Democrat Tessa Hunt win the seat, which she took with a majority of just 800 over Conservative David Heathcoat-Amory. He was re-selected as UKIP’s Wells candidate in April. But soon afterwards he claims he became the victim of a vendetta by Glen and Colleen Tucker. The Tuckers say Mr Baynes is simply ‘not up to the job’ - though they deny having any vendetta against his leadership. In return, his supporters say the Tuckers of being just the kind of ‘fruitcakes and loonies’ which have dogged Ukip in its attempts to be seen as a serious party. Resigning on Tuesday evening, Mr Baynes explained: ‘There has been a continuous campaign by people who, for some reason didn’t want me selected, to work their very hardest to oust me.’ He continued: ‘It’s got so bad that I really want to get out of it - I don’t want to get involved in politics again. ‘I’ve realised politics is a very ugly, dirty business, and I want nothing more to do with it.’ Referring to the owners of the Angelic Guidance and Healing Centre in Glastonbury, a town said to have ‘mystic’ properties, he said: ‘Glastonbury has many different quirky things about it, and that’s what makes it unique and I love that. ‘But I don’t think it has a place in politics, especially when you are in conversation with the Archangel. ‘I don’t think I have experienced any of their [the Tucker’s] angelic healing in my career and the campaign they have against me.’ Mr Baynes with UKIP leader Nigel Farage: His allies have pointed the finger at two ‘oddball’ fellow UKIP members who run an ‘angelic healing group’ in the Somerset town of Glastonbury . Mr Baynes has also claimed UKIP want the Conservatives to win the seat, which is currently held by the Liberal Democrats. Glenn and Colleen Tucker, who run the Angelic Guidance and Healing Centre, in Glastonbury, describe their business as a ‘form of energy healing’. They said in a statement: ‘There’s no plot against Jake Baynes’, adding that he was simply not ‘up to the job’. Mr Tucker stood unsuccessfully as a UKIP candidate in the county council elections a couple of years ago, while Mrs Tucker is currently the UKIP Somerset treasurer. Mr Tucker said of Mr Livings: ‘He accused us of being part of the occult, which is ridiculous. ‘What we do here has nothing to do with our involvement in UKIP. We’re stalwarts of the community in Glastonbury.’ He added: ‘He is confused, if he thinks it is an occult he really doesn’t understand what we do. We are spiritual people. ‘It is like he is trying to demonise us and scare people. It is absolute trash what he said about following the Archangel Michael’s every word.’ Mrs Tucker added: ‘It is wonderful news that they have resigned but I feel a little bit ridiculous about it all.’ A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Bayne’s claim that the party wanted a Tory victory was ‘absolute nonsense’. He added: ‘It is a Lib Dem seat which we will be fighting as hard as we can.’","Jake Baynes claim he is the victim of a vendetta by two fellow UKIP members .
