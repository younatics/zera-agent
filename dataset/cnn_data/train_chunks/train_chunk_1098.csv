"Terror: Since the 9/11 attack terrorist attacks have more than quadrupled, according to the study . The number of terrorist attacks each year has more than quadrupled in the decade since 9/11, according to a study launched today. The Global Terrorist Index showed that in 2002 there were 982 separate attacks. By 2011 that had risen to 4,564. Researchers suggest the U.S. military interventions pursued as part of the West's anti-al Qaeda 'war on terror' may have made terrorism worse. It also said it was impossible to prove whether the policy made the U.S homeland safer. Despite the increase in attacks in the . past ten years, the number of deaths in terrorists attacks has fallen. It peaked in 2007 at the height of the Iraq war when 10,009 people died. That figure had fallen to 7,473 last year. Iraq, . Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Yemen have been the most affected by . terrorism in the past ten years. The rankings were based on the number of . attacks, fatalities, injuries and the level of property damage caused in each country through terrorist attacks. Steve . Killelea, founder and executive chairman of the Institute for Economics and Peace, which published the report, said: 'After . 9/11, terrorist activity fell back to pre-2000 levels until after the . Iraq invasion, and has since escalated dramatically. 'Iraq . accounts for about a third of all terrorist deaths over the last . decade, and Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan account for over 50 percent . of fatalities.' In the decade since 9/11, fatalities from terrorist attacks have increased by 195%, incidents by 460% and injuries by 224%. War on Terror: The number of fatalities in terrorist attacks quadrupled at the peak of the Iraq War . Costly: Of the 20 terrorist attacks that claimed the most lives in the past ten years, 11 happened in Iraq. More than 100 people died in this car bomb explosion in Baghdad in 2007 . The upswing in attacks in both Afghanistan and Pakistan only occurred after the Iraq war, coinciding with heightened U.S-backed military campaigns by NATO and the Pakistani government respectively, the report said. The findings suggested foreign powers should think twice before intervening militarily, Mr Killelea said, even in countries such as Syria, which is already seeing widespread bloodshed. Unless the conflict was brought to a swift end, terror attacks might actually increase, he said. The index is based on data from the Global Terrorism Database run by the University of Maryland. It said the greatest deterioration in 2011 took place in Syria and Yemen. Yemen has seen a dramatic upsurge in al Qaeda-linked activity in recent years, while Syrian rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad have increasingly turned to suicide attacks and bombings. Of the 158 countries surveyed, only 31 had not experienced a single event classified as a 'terrorist act' since 2001. These included Brazil, Croatia, Ghana, Jamaica and Poland. Even when the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington were taken into account, North America remained the least-affected region over the period studied. Western Europeans were 19 times more likely to die in a terrorist attack than North Americans, the report said. Impact: The map demonstrates how countries are affected by terrorism. Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan have felt the highest impact, while countries such as Costa Rica and Ghana have had no terrorist attacks in the past decade . The U.S, Algeria and Colombia had the biggest improvements over the last ten years. In 2011, the areas most impacted by terrorism were the Middle East, India, Pakistan and Russia. Mr Killelea said 'caution against unwanted consequences' needs to be shown by policymakers. He said: 'Terrorism is one of the most emotive subjects of our time. The impact of terrorism does seem to have plateaued over the last three years but is still unacceptably high. 'The aim of the GTI is to systematically analyse and quantify the phenomena. 'The GTI examines trends to help inform a positive and practical debate about the future of terrorism and appropriate policy responses. 'The GTI highlights that many of the countries suffering the most from terrorism have also suffered from foreign military intervention. 'Although the ""responsibility to protect"" is paramount, caution needs to be taken against unwanted consequences. 'I urge policymakers to use the findings of this report to help redefine tackling terrorism strategies and help shift focus towards peace.'","More terrorist attacks have been recorded but the number of fatalities has fallen 25 per cent since 2007 .

"Is Yaya right to be angry over birthday snub? Yaya Toure has backed his agent Dimitri Seluk's bizarre attack on Manchester City for forgetting the midfielder's birthday and says he will clarify his future after the World Cup. Seluk cast doubt on the Ivorian staying at the Etihad by saying the influential star was unhappy with the club. And Toure tweeted: 'My agent was trying to make a point here on my behalf, joke aside.It seems important for me to make a statement.. I am going to do so. 'Everything dimitry said is true. He speaks for me. I will give an interview after world cup to explain.' VIDEO Scroll down for Yaya Toure: My career's great; going to City was the right move . Glory: Yaya Toure holds the title trophy with Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini . Comments: Toure's agent Dimitri Seluk has been in the public eye over the last week . Seluk earlier revealed Brazil legend Roberto Carlos was given a super car by Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala to mark his birthday. The agent appeared on Sky Sports News on Tuesday afternoon, saying: 'This happened on May 13. Today is May 20. 'Until now nobody from staff called Yaya and said sorry. It was really was not right. It is not a little bit correct. 'If they don't want Yaya, no problem. We can leave any moment, without any problem.' Toure had attempted to diffuse the row as he tweeted: 'Thanks for all the birthday messages today. Card from City just arrived... Must have got lost in the post. Haha. 'Jokes aside. Please do not take words that do not come out of MY mouth seriously. Judge my commitment to @MCFC by my performances.' But his later support of Seluk will have City fans concerned about their star man's future. Despite a video emerging showing the City players on a plane presenting a cake to Toure - whom the club regard as 'unsellable' - and singing 'Happy Birthday', Seluk told the BBC: 'None of them shook his hand on his birthday. It's really sick, you know. 'He got a cake but when it was Roberto Carlos's birthday, the president of Anzhi gave him a Bugatti.

Speaking in The Sun, Seluk said: 'There is a big possibility Yaya will leave this summer. He is very upset. What happened at his birthday means the club don't care about him. It was proof. 'They can say whatever they want, ""Oh we like him but we forgot"". Forgot? About Yaya? The player who helped you to be two-time Premier League champions? The guy who helped you win the FA Cup and League Cup? 'In a normal team, his team-mates and club would at least give him good wishes. But when you win the title and two days later you have a big party to celebrate the title and nobody comes to Yaya to say happy birthday, what more do you want? 'If a player like Yaya went to Liverpool and they won the league for the first time in 24 years, Yaya would be a god in Liverpool. 'But at City, Yaya is no hero. He's nobody. That's how the club make him feel. He's very upset and he started thinking about leaving the club. And he will leave if things carry on like this. 'We're not doing this for more money.

"Home Secretary Theresa May wants security services to be able to snoop on email and internet records, but Nick Clegg is seeking to delay the Communications Data Bill . Water and power firms are being targeted by foreign countries launching cyber attacks against Britain. The services ‘upon which daily life depends’ risk being disrupted by hackers working for the UK's enemies, officials claimed. Internet terrorism from ‘hostile foreign states’ is now one of the top four threats Britain faces. The scale of the problem comes as Home Secretary Theresa May stepped up her call for more powers to track email and internet use. She claimed people will ‘die’ without more powers to track terrorists, paedophiles and criminals online. A major Coalition split was laid bare as Mrs May took a swipe at Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg for blocking new internet powers to break up criminal plots on sites like Facebook and Skype. The £2billion law – dubbed a snoopers charter - would store billions of pieces of private information from emails, Facebook, texts and internet use. In a thinly-veiled swipe at her Cabinet colleague, Mrs May said opponents of her legislation are 'putting politics before people’s lives’. Mr Clegg wants to delay the Communications Data Bill until 2014 to strike a balance between security and liberty’. But Mrs May said: ‘The people who say they’re against this bill need to look victims of serious crime, terrorism and child sex offences in the eye and tell them why they’re not prepared to give the police the powers they need to protect the public. ‘We would certainly see criminals going free as a result of this. There will be paedophiles who will not be identified and it will reduce our ability to deal with this serious organised crime,’ she told The Sun. Mrs May suggested . the new laws were needed to prevent a repeat of the 7/7 London bombings . or the shootings of two female police officers in Manchester in . September. ‘The . shootings of Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone brought everybody up sharp to . show the extent of the problem that can be caused by criminals. ‘It . would be harder for us to crack into organised crime gangs, and yes we . could see people dying as a result of not being able to have access to . this information.’ Mrs May said opponents of her Communications Data Bill had to 'look victims of terrorism in the eye', like those caught up in the 7/7 London bombings . She went on: 'Criminals, terrorists and paedophiles will want MPs to vote against this bill. 'Victims of crime, police and the public will want them to vote for it. It's a question of whose side you're on.' However, a committee of MPs and peers is . expected to issue damning criticism of the measures this week, arguing . ministers have not made the case that is really needed. The Home Office insists the proposed storage of website visits for 12 months, along with use of Skype and even online games consoles, will protect national security. Without it, police and the security services will lose their ability to track the activities of crime gangs and paedophiles over time, they argue. Officials warn that new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images. Gaps in coverage already mean the authorities have no access to a quarter of all communications data. The plans would cover when and to whom a phone call was made, not what was said. The content of emails would also not be stored, just details of who sent and received them. In a separate move the Government is warning critical infrastructure is being targeted by online terrorists. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude is . publishing an update of the Government's cyber security strategy, . including fresh measures to improve the UK's ability to detect and . defeat high-end threats’. Cyber attacks have been launched against the supplies 'upon which daily life depends,' including power firms . Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude is warning companies they must become more 'cyber savvy' Systems controlling vital utilities like power and water supplies are being targeted, officials say. Firms providing ‘the essential services upon which daily life depends’ have been attacked from abroad, an official told The Guardian. The government is advising multi-national firms on how to prevent hackers disrupting supplies. Mr Maude said the entire country needed to become more ‘cyber savvy’. He added: ‘The internet transforms the risk we face. It is why we have rated attacks from cyberspace one of the top four threats to our national security. ‘We are in a race to build sufficient cyber defences to match the growing volume and dependence of our online economic, security and social interests. ‘It's a race we can only win by working together: Government, industry, academia and the public. This is as much a shared responsibility as a shared effort.’ Earlier this year Foreign Secretary William Hague and Business Secretary Vince Cable called in the chairmen and chief executives of Ftse 100 companies for a briefing in the Foreign Office to spell out the dangers including the online theft of valuable intellectual property and commercially sensitive information. At the same time ministers want to highlight the commercial potential of Britain's growing expertise in cyber security to boost exports around the world.","Home Secretary says opponents of her Communications Data Bill must look victims of terrorism 'in the eye'

"Man United are back in the title race . Bojan can become a Stoke legend . Sheikh Mansour deserves praise for building City's £200m Football Academy . The main talking point after Everton's defeat at Manchester City on Saturday was the performance of referee Andre Marriner. It wasn't great and Roberto Martinez was quick to point that out. But I was more interested in an aspect of Everton's game that let them down badly – corners. Everton fans will already be aware that their manager Martinez is not a big believer that set-pieces are a significant advantage – he said in an interview earlier this year: 'I do prefer open play goals, I'm not going to hide it. A goal from open play is a more satisfying goal.' Everton surround Andre Marriner after the referee awarded Man City a controversial penalty on Saturday . Everton also felt aggrieved that Fernando was not sent off for a high boot on midfielder Gareth Barry . It's an admirable policy, unless you're trying to win at Manchester City when they are bang in form. I thought Everton played well and possibly deserved something from the game. Joe Hart made one fantastic save from Romelu Lukaku but apart from that there were few chances created from open play by the visitors. Their endeavour did, however, force seven corners. All of which were truly terrible. Here's the catalogue of corner cock-ups from Everton on Saturday: . 1st corner – 39 minutes: Leighton Baines took it from the left, it was easily headed away by Yaya Toure on the edge of the six-yard box with no Everton player challenging for the ball at all. 2nd corner – 57 minutes: Kevin Mirallas took this one, again from the left, and it went high into the hands of Hart with no Everton player even close to the ball. 3rd corner – 68 minutes: Taken short by Mirallas, played back to him by Baines, the cross was lofted high into Hart's hands again. Leighton Baines and the rest of the Everton team struggled to utilise set-pieces during the defeat by Man City . 4th corner – 72 minutes: Baines took this from the right. It barely left the ground and was easily cleared by Gael Clichy before it had even reached the six-yard box. Baines was then taken off corners. 5th corner – 81 minutes: Mirallas with an outswinger from the right. Headed away easily by Toure under no pressure whatsoever on the edge of the six-yard box. 6th corner – 91 minutes: Ross Barkley took this one, and again it was headed away on the edge of the six-yard box by Toure. No Everton player jumped with him. 7th corner – 95 minutes: Samuel Eto'o rushed to take this one with time running out. An outswinger from the right hand side. Headed away again by Toure on the edge of the six-yard box. It makes embarrassing reading. Everton boss Roberto Martinez admits he  prefers his teams to score goals from open play than set pieces . A corner is an opportunity to put a ball into the box, a chance to create a goalscoring opportunity. The corner taker can't be tackled, obviously, so it is a chance to deliver a ball unchallenged and unhindered. And yet all seven of Everton's corners at City were dreadful. I would have thought a set-piece would be regarded as a great way to get something from a trip to the champions, but Martinez obviously disagrees. Even the two free-kicks Everton had close to the penalty area troubled the wall more than the goal – Mirallas taking both. Martinez sees set-pieces as a negative. 'The hardest thing in football is to break a team down when everyone is behind the ball. A free-kick or a dead-ball situation is less in your control. But you are relying on the bounce of the ball or people switching off or doing their duties,' the Everton boss has said. I understand his point, but if you are clever from set-piece situations, if you work on them on the training ground, then they might also give you an advantage. As much as defenders can set themselves ready for a corner, they don't know exactly what the opposition are planning with each delivery. Kevin Mirallas took two free-kicks against Man City but troubled the wall rather than goalkeeper Joe Hart . On Saturday, Yaya Toure took up his position on the edge of the six-yard box and Everton gave him the ball from their corner. To not believe that corner offered a significant advantage is one thing, but to effectively not bother trying to make anything with them isn't clever. Martinez though is adamant: 'You are a winning team when you don't rely on set-pieces.' Except Everton lost a game they should have got something from because their set-pieces were so bad. I love that Martinez treasures possession and tries to play football the right way. But with all those corners on Saturday, Everton gave the ball straight to Manchester City, which goes against his own philosophy surely? The irony is that Martinez's finest moment in football came when his Wigan side won the FA Cup – against Manchester City – in 2013. The winning goal came when Ben Watson headed home… from a Shaun Maloney corner. I suspect Evertonians will be hoping Finch Farm might see a few corners being taken this week. Ben Watson climbs highest to head home the winning goal for Wigan against Man City in the 2013 FA Cup final .","Everton's corners and free-kicks let them down badly against Man City .

"An MI6 agent who managed to infiltrate al-Qaeda in a bid to kill one of its leaders was told by his British bosses they would not assassinate him because it could be against the law. Terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki was encouraging attacks on the West and also recruiting young Muslims to carry them out but despite being able to murder him Morten Storm was blocked by London, it has emerged. Storm says he was told by his bosses in the UK: 'We do not involve ourselves in encouraging people to participate in . jihad and we don’t involve ourselves in killings abroad. Our objective . is to gather intelligence.' Claims: MI6 spy Morten Storm could have killed terrorist leader Anwar al-Awlaki but Britain said no, he says . British secret services then cut Storm off completely when he approached the Americans instead, he has claimed. A source told the Daily Telegraph that no spy can kill anyone without permission from the Foreign Secretary. Advice says 'Lethal . force' can only be used in those circumstances in an 'emergency or . crisis which causes danger to the UK or its citizens' - which means it . has not been used for decades, the source added. The CIA went on to assassinate al-Awlaki in a drone attack because he was known to have preached to the 9/11 hijackers and his videos were found across Britain in terrorist homes and in an extreme bookshop used by the 7/7 attackers. Made for each other? Storm says he conducted an . exchange of videos between Awlaki and Aminah, in which they talked about . her becoming his third wife . Storm and al-Awlaki, who was a U.S. citizen and lived in the UK for two years, became so close . he was offered $250,000 by the CIA to find a wife for Awlaki - who . already had two - in an effort to track him down. To do this, Storm turned to Facebook, and found 'Aminah' - who said she was a fan of Awlaki. He then orchestrated an exchange of  video messages between the two, and - despite an assassination order on Awlaki from the U.S. - they agreed to marry. But while successful in its early stages, the rest of the CIA's plot was thwarted. Storm suffered a troubled childhood, drifting through drugs and into crime. In 1997, the Dane said that he converted in prison to Islam and upon leaving moved to Yemen to study the Koran. He added that in 2000 he married a Yemeni woman with whom he had a son named Osama. It is understood in 2006, he had a . dramatic and unexplained change of heart and was turned double agent by . the Danish intelligence service, PET. Dead: Anwar al-Awlaki (left and right) was killed in a . drone attack in Yemen in September 2011 - Morten Storm claims it was . directly helped by him . After five years, Storm claimed to . have worked his way to the top of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's . inner circle and gained direct access to al-Awlaki. Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, . had become the lead figure for al-Qaeda and the offshoot al-Qaeda in the . Arabian Peninsula in the years after Osama bin Laden went into hiding. Before his death, he was believed to . be responsible for persuading Nigerian terrorist Omar Farouk . Abdulmuttalab to conceal explosives in his underwear which he tried to . use to blow up a Detroit-bound plane on December 25th, 2009. He also played a role in the 2009 . Fort Hood massacre and the failed plot by Faisal Shahzad to detonate an . SUV filled with explosives on May 1, 2010. The CIA plan he orchestrated, Morton says, was to . plant a tracking device on Aminah's luggage when she came to Yemen to . meet her new husband - which would lead the agency directly to Awlaki's . hideout. In a video appearing on the site of . Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, she said: 'I would go with him . anywhere. I am 32 years old and I am ready for dangerous things. I’m not . afraid of death or to die in the sake of Allah.' Croatian Aminah, who used to work with disabled children in Zagreb, also adds: 'I feel nervous. This is very awkward for me. I just taped this so you can see how I look.' Three peas in a pod? President Obama and Defense Secretary and former CIA boss Leon Panetta were allegedly aware of Morten Storm's existence . In his reply, Awlaki - who had specifically requested a white Muslim convert to be his 'companion in hiding' - said: 'If you can live in difficult conditions, do not mind loneliness and can live with restrictions on your communication with others, then that is great.' He also mentions an associate, purported to be Storm, saying: 'The brother who is carrying this video is a trustworthy brother.' The pair exchanged encrypted video messages, with Awlaki saying in one: 'I currently do not live in a tent, but in a house [that] belongs to a friend. I'm not leaving the house and am in a situation for my wife to be with me all the time. I prefer this residence [to] a tent in the mountains because it gives me ability to read, write and research.' At a meeting in Vienna, Austria, Storm showed Aminah a video recording made by Awlaki, who was dressed in white robes in front of a pink background with a floral motif. In it he says: 'This recording is done specifically for Sister Aminah at her request. I pray Allah guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter. And guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this proposal.' Storm said Aminah burst into tears when after watching the video.","Morten Storm could have murdered Anwar al-Awlaki but claims he was told by London: 'We don’t involve ourselves in killings abroad'

"A Saudi Arabian official has been caught on camera beating migrant workers and chasing them out of a passport office in the latest revelation of poor treatment of foreigners in the country. The video filmed in the coastal city of Jeddah shows the official lashing out with a thick leather belt and shouting 'Out!', as visitors to the office run to safety. He appears to hit one man, an African, in the face with the strap, before pushing him backwards as the migrant tries to hold the weapon to prevent further blows. Beating: A Saudi passport official is caught on camera dishing out a blow with his belt to an African migrant worker who is at the office to get his work permit and immigration papers legalised . The video, filmed on Sunday and . uploaded to YouTube the same day, will reignite anger at the way migrant . workers are treated in the oil-rich Gulf kingdom. Saudi . Arabia has become increasingly dependent on foreign labour, and . although foreign workers often fill technical positions, most are now . employed in the agriculture, cleaning and domestic service industries. The . hierarchy of foreign workers is often dependent on their country of . origin, with the lower positions occupied by people from Africa, the . Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Now . however the situation for migrants is increasingly precarious, with . many facing expulsion from the country as its rulers try to curb high . unemployment, which reached 12 per cent by the end of 2012. Some 200,000 have already been rounded up and sent home by authorities keen to free up the labour market for Saudi workers. The video, filmed on Sunday and uploaded to YouTube the same day, will reignite anger at the way migrant workers are treated in the Gulf kingdom, which is dependent on foreign labour but has high unemployment . Jeddah-based human rights activist Walid Abou Al-khail told France 24 how the deportation measures had lead to a flood of migrants visiting passport offices to attempt to legalise their status. 'Many workers have been able to come here by getting a sponsor, and then leaving them in order to work for themselves,' said Mr Al-khail. 'Others change sponsor. So these workers' situation is not legal in the eyes of the state. And some have entered the country with a pilgrim visa, and then they’ve stayed and worked illegally. 'It is these workers who are targeted by the government’s expulsion measures. The campaign has given rise to abuse: there are images showing hundreds of workers packed into trucks, sent back home from one day to the next, even though they have all their belongings here.' After hitting the man the immigration official pushes him backwards, as he attempts to clear the passport centre . Mr Al-khail told how the passport centres were being overwhelmed by the numbers of applicants. 'These images are shocking, but unfortunately they offer just one small example of the mistreatment suffered by migrant workers in Saudi Arabia,' he added. The video was uploaded to YouTube  on Sunday by Abdulaziz Taj. In the clip's description he tells how it was filmed by his father who was accompanying his domestic worker on a visit to the passport centre. 'I think there is an association of animal rights to prevent animals being hit in this brutal manner, let alone human beings!' Mr Taj wrote. 'I'm waiting for a response from anyone official,' he added.","Shocking scenes filmed in coastal city of Jeddah .

"Man United are back in the title race . Everton let themselves down with their set-pieces against Manchester City . Bojan can become a Stoke legend . Manchester City’s £200million state-of-the-art Football Academy opened this week to a flood of questions about whether they will succeed in producing any homegrown players, and more specifically will they develop any young players who will go on to play for England. When Micah Richards left in the summer it felt like a part of Manchester City’s soul was dying. Let’s remember this is a club with a proud history of producing its own players. The Youth Cup-winning side of 1986 has a special place in the hearts of City fans, with players like Andy Hinchcliffe, Ian Scott, Steve Redmond, Paul Lake, Paul Moulden, Ian Brightwell and David White all progressing to the first team. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester City's new £200m training complex . When Micah Richards left Manchester City in the summer it felt like a part of the club's soul was dying . The Man City academy graduate joined Italian side Fiorentina on loan having spent 13 years with his first club . Paul Lake, Andy Hinchcliffe, Steve Redmond, Dave White, and Ian Brightwell (from left to right) were all members of the Manchester City side who won the Youth Cupback in 1986 . Some helped City get back into the top flight, some even played in one of City’s greatest ever victories – 5-1 over Fergie’s big-spending Manchester United in 1989. Hinchcliffe and White all went on to play for England, while the brilliant Lake was in Bobby Robson’s provisional 30-man squad for the 1990 World Cup, before injuries curtailed his career. Those were special times for City fans who, like supporters of most clubs, love to see a young, local player come through the system and play for the first team. On opening this new academy, Manchester City have set themselves a target of producing four to six homegrown players for the first team. And the sceptics are questioning whether that will ever happen. Who the hell do these sceptics think they are? A map of the new Etihad Campus, which has been built just over the road from the Etihad Stadium . There are three gyms at City's new  complex, with one featuring the giant slogan 'create the future' on the wall . The training complex is linked to the club's Etihad Stadium by a long bridge that straddles Alan Turing Way . Lake (left) celebrates City's famous 5-1 victory over local rivals Man United with Ian Bishop back in 1989 . Sheikh Mansour has sanctioned not just a huge fortune on the building of this academy for Manchester City Football Club. He has demanded the very best facilities – there is a room in this building where at the push of a button conditions can be replicated from anywhere in the world at any time of year. He is providing young hopefuls with the best conditions to succeed, and the best chance of getting a decent education while they’re chasing the football dream. Perhaps even more importantly the Sheikh’s money is regenerating part of east Manchester and reducing unemployment with 70 per cent of the workforce taken on since the project's inception drawn from the local area, and 10 per cent of the staff previously unemployed. Sheikh Mansour's vision for City is being realised, and his quote from six years ago is emblazoned on the entrance to the CFA . It is a massive boost for football in Manchester, and for the economy of the area. It’s not the FA responsible, and it’s not the government. It’s a man from the United Arab Emirates. So instead of posing hypothetical questions about how many homegrown players will be in City’s first team in five years time, people should say thanks to Shiekh Mansour for what he’s given to Manchester City Football Club and to the city of Manchester. Sure City have set themselves a target they know some will judge them on – Bayern Munich do the same. Their policy every year is to try to produce three players for their first team, three good enough for the Bundesliga, and three good enough to be professionals lower down the ladder. If that doesn’t happen have they failed? No of course not. Instead of hypothetical questions, people should thank Shiekh Mansour for what he's given to the City of Manchester - including the Premier League title, clinched by Sergio Aguero in 2012 . Same applies to Manchester City. As an owner, Sheikh Mansour cannot be faulted. As a club, City are getting so many things right. They have the ambition to produce players for the first team, and if it happens some of them will be English. Cynics want to knock it down already. Not me. I’m too busy admiring a club and an owner trying to make English football and English society better.","Manchester City opened a new £200m Football Academy this week .

"Oldham manager Lee Johnson admitted that the Ched Evans saga had been 'unique' but declined to reveal whether he thought the club should have been able to sign the convicted rapist following his side's 2-2 draw with Doncaster Rovers. The 33-year-old was asked by MailOnline if he believed the deal, which collapsed on Thursday should have gone through. However, a club press officer interrupted and the interview ended. Oldham fans hold up a banner in relation to a petition set up against the move for Ched Evans' which attracted more than 70,000 signatures . Earlier Johnson said the potential move, which Oldham said fell through after threats from sponsors to remove their backing and after threats to staff, was decided on by the club's board. 'It was a very unique potential signing and one that could only have been made at the top end of the board,' he explained. 'There were so many aspects, it divided opinion even among individual families. I have to respect that and make sure I am very careful with what I say to protect everybody.' Oldham manager Lee Johnson kept his composure during a challenging few days for the club . Johnson revealed he had tried to turn the issue, which saw the world's media descend on the League One club, into a positive. 'It's been nice to be part of a team under siege,' he said. 'Everyone has stuck together. When you're in the media as much as we have been, it's been different but we've stuck together. Oldham defender Joseph Mills was sent off for a reckless challenge on Reece Wabara of Doncaster Rovers . 'I think the players and office staff come out with credit after what they have had to deal with. They have been superb.' During the first half around 20 supporters in the main stand chanted 'There's only one Ched Evans' while a cluster of fans in the home Chaddy End held a banner with the words '70,000 where are you?' in reference to a petition set up against the move for Evans' which attracted more than 70,000 signatures. Johnson said he had seen the banner but declined to comment on its content. Goalscorer George Elokobi holds up a T-shirt with the tribute 'To The French Victims RIP' Loan striker Jabo Ibhere gave Oldham the lead in the 23rd minute with a curling effort from inside the area. The 31-year-old, due to return to Colchester after this match, was teed up by fellow frontman Jonathan Forte who seized on an error from Rovers defender Andy Butler. Giant centre-half George Elokobi headed in Joseph Mills' corner on minutes on 54 minutes to make it 2-0 for the home side. On 75 minutes Mills saw red for a two-footed tackle on Doncaster full back Reece Wabara despite referee Carl Boyeson initially missing the offence. Three minutes later Rovers striker Nathan Tyson appeared to bundle over home keeper Paul Rachubka before halving the deficit. Deep into stoppage time James Coppinger cut in from the right to level the scores and further incense an already-furious home crowd to snatch a barely deserved point for the visitors.

"Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish thinks convicted rapist Ched Evans needs to 'go away, get his appeal done, and then come back into football' if he is to resume his professional career. Evans maintains his innocence and his case will be examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which will advise on whether it sees grounds to launch an appeal. Parish feels the former Sheffield United striker's lack of remorse has made it difficult, and that Evans is going about returning to football all wrong.

'If you're convicted of a crime, and you're on licence for that crime, he is effectively on probation. 'To have no remorse, to say ""I just didn't do it"", and expect everybody to employ you in the public domain in a very public sport, I think he has been badly advised. 'He really needs to go away, get his appeal done, and then come back into football and show the experience has changed him somehow.' Evans was close to signing a contract with League One club Oldham Athletic but the deal fell through after a storm of opposition. Steve Bruce contacted League One club Oldham to give them support over their move for Evans (above) Oldham fans hold a banner in relation to a petition against Evans joining which attracted 70,000 signatures . Oldham director Barry Owen insisted he has no regrets over the club's aborted attempt to sign the convicted rapist, and that it was only called off due to money issues. 'I will never regret it,' he told the BBC's Football League Show. 'I am hugely disappointed for many reasons that I can't discuss. 'Oldham were going to get a footballer that in other circumstances they wouldn't have been able to afford. This was driven by football reasons. 'We knew there would be a storm to bear and were prepared to accept a lot of that and take it on the chin because we believed strongly in the right to employ this man. 'We did not anticipate the amount of sponsorship pressure, which was understandable because they were under extreme pressure. In the end it came down purely to the finances.'

"Barcelona coach Luis Enrique says the thought of having a team without Lionel Messi is 'not even something we contemplate'. The future of the Argentina forward as been the subject of much speculation recently, following reports that he had fallen out with Enrique. Messi has been linked with a move to Premier League champions Manchester City and leaders Chelsea, but Enrique does not want to see the four-time former world player of the year leave the Nou Camp. Lionel Messi, arriving at the Ballon d'Or ceremony, will not be sold by Barcelona say Luis Enrique . Messi had partner Antonella Roccuzzo with him for the award ceremony in Switzerland on Monday .

"Swansea midfielder Pablo Hernandez is the subject of a £4million bid from Al Arabi in Qatar. The club is managed by former Chelsea defender Dan Petrescu who has also tried to sign Xavi Hernandez from Barcelona. Swansea paid £5.5million for Pablo Hernandez two seasons ago and may struggle to get that money back but he is 29 now and that may be the best offer they get. The Spaniard held talks in the Middle East last week and is eager to sign up with other members of Swansea's Spanish contingent also being targeted by Qatari clubs.

Michu though is expected to finalise his move to Napoli in the coming days if Swansea can agree to an initial loan with £8million to follow in a year's time. Sensing the upheaval, chairman Huw Jenkins is not letting Wilfried Bony or Ben Davies leave cheaply. Liverpool have been put off paying over £20m for Bony and are weighing up other options. Similarly they believe left-back Davies is over-priced but £10m may represent a good investment eventually for the promising 21-year-old. If they don't pay they know that Tottenham may do as they like both players and are continuing to barter. Liverpool will discuss a deal for Sevilla's Alberto Moreno again but it will be separate from the deal they strike for striker Iago Aspas with the Spanish side keen to loan the 26-year-old. Swansea have held talks with Sturm Graz about 24-year-old Bosnia international midfielder Anel Hadzic.

"Events that offer to set up wealthy older men with young cash-strapped women, dubbed ‘Sugar Daddy Parties’, are about to hit Britain after becoming popular in the U.S. The parties have been hosted at swanky New York cocktail bars, where the ‘daddies’ discuss fees for future dates with the women who take their fancy – and its organisers are now seeking London venues. The 'matchmakers' justify the events by insisting that all participants are consenting adults and 'nobody has to do anything they don't want to' but critics say the parties are bordering on prostitution. And the scenes from New York venues that have hosted the get-togethers, showing pretty young women hanging off the arms off much older men only add to the sleaziness factor. Looking for financial support: The 'Sugar Daddy Party' at the Hudson Terrace in Manhattan sees a young blonde meet an older wealthy 'sugar daddy' to discuss fees for future dates or a relationship . On average, fees of $500 per date is . said to be common in the U.S., but arrangements worth between $10,000 . and $20,000 per month have also been agreed upon in the past, according . to its organiser. Despite denying that they’re . encouraging prostitution, organisers say the women are usually aged in . their late teens or early twenties and are seeking money to pay for . university fees or a more glamorous lifestyle. And they say there are already thousands of British ‘sugar babies’ waiting to meet ‘daddies’, according to the Daily Telegraph. The . chief executive of the company Seeking Arrangement, Brandon Wade, told . the newspaper: ‘We have perfected our parties and are now ready to . launch in even bigger markets like London. ‘We are due to start in early 2012.’ At one party hosted at the Hudson . Terrace bar in New York, 600 hopefuls turned up to meet their future . ‘sugar daddy’ or ‘sugar baby’ and while the men were charged $100 (£62) to attend, the women paid $40 (£25) at the door. Looking for love or money? An older man holds onto a glass of wine and a cigar as he hugs two women at the party . Business is booming: At one party hosted at Hudson Terrace bar in New York, 600 hopefuls turned up to meet their future 'sugar daddy' or 'sugar baby' The average older man was aged 38, . while the average woman was over a decade younger, however some men aged . well into their 60s were also in attendance. Host Alan Schneider told the newspaper his events are ‘elegant, classy and refined’, and Wade boasts two men from Forbes magazines top 10 wealthiest American billionaires among the members of his website. While brushing off similarities to prostitution, 41-year-old Wade said: ‘People may feel obligated, but no one is required to do anything that they don’t want to.’ But in August the ‘elite sugar daddy dating site’ SeekingArrangement.com was being criticised in the U.S. for its ethos. Plan to find a man: Young women paid $40 to attend the party, while men paid $100 in an effort to meet a partner . Host: Seeking Arrangement's party host Alan Schneider says his events are 'elegant, classy and refined' Ronald Weitzer, a sociology professor at George Washington University, said: 'Under the banner of sugar daddy and sugar baby arrangements, a lot of prostitution may be going on.' Las Vegas lawyer Allen Lichtenstein said the legal parameters of prostitution are clouded. But Mr Lichtenstein said: 'Any relationship that is an ongoing one that's not purely about sex but may have a sexual aspect to it, you can't really classify as prostitution.' One of the site's users, 'Taylor,' said she was paid $350 to have sex with a man more than twice her age. Taylor said: 'I just wanted to get out of that situation as safely as possible, pay off my debt, and move on.' While a 19-year-old student from Stevenage, Demi Maguire, expressed her desire to find a sugar daddy who would pay her up to £1,800 per month for a relationship. She said she was looking for ‘sponsorship’ in order to do volunteer work in Tanzania and Uganda for 12 weeks. Similar websites offering to set up young women with wealthy older men such as sugardaddyforme.com and myrichsugardaddy.com have been booming with business. And Wade seems determined to introduce Britain to the party scene. Dangerous liaisons? 'Sugar babies' are offered the opportunity to pay the bills through 'dates' with older, more financially secure men on SeekingArrangement.com and the parties are coming to Britain .","An average fee of $500 per date is usual in the U.S.

"The woman behind everyone's favorite cookie: Ruth Wakefield, founder of the Toll House restaurant in Whitman, Massachusetts, created the chocolate-chip cookie in 1938 . There are two popular stories about how the chocolate-chip cookie was invented by Ruth Wakefield in 1938. One theory is that Wakefield, the co-owner of Whitman, Massachusetts' Toll House restaurant, accidentally spilled a bag of chocolate morsels into a batch of cookie dough that was being prepared in a mixer. The other is that Wakefield added chopped up bits of a chocolate candy bar when she ran out of nuts. Both of those theories were disproved by Carolyn Wyman in her recently-published book about the sweet-treat's origin: 'The Great American Chocolate Chip Cookie book'. In her research for the book, Wyman tracked down a rare interview given by Wakefield in 1974, just three years before the cookie inventor died. In the interview, Wakefield explains that she was trying to improve a cookie recipe they had been serving at her restaurant. 'We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different,' Wakefield explained. Adding chocolate chips made the cookies the new star of the dessert and they became an instant hit across the country. Unlike the fame-seeking celebrity chefs of today, Wakefield didn't care to use her recipe to get her places. Instead, she sold the recipe to Nestle nearly 75 years ago this week. The chocolate company then went on to start mass-producing chocolate chips. Touch of genius: Wakefield gave an interview in 1974, saying she was trying to improve a Butterscotch cookie when she created the world's first batch of chocolate-chip cookies . The best thing since sliced bread: The cookies became an instant hit at Wakefield's Toll House restaurant, and soon swept the country when Nestle began mass-producing chocolate chips . How-to: Soon after inventing the cookies, Wakefield sold the rights to her recipe to Nestle and they still publish her instructions on the back of their chocolate-chip bags . Chocolate chips remain one of the few food items specifically created for use in a recipe. They also printed Wakefield's original Toll House cookies recipe on the back of the chocolate-chip packaging. The recipe is still on the back of the bag today and remains the most frequently made back-of-the-package recipe. While it may seem a shame that Nestle profited from her invention, signing over her recipe proved fruitful in the end since it drove traffic to her restaurant and helped turn her cookbook 'Toll House Tried and True Recipes' into a best-seller. Eventually Wakefield and her husband Ken retired from running the restaurant, passing the popular eatery on to new owners. Wakefield passed away in 1977, and was quickly followed in death by the Toll House restaurant itself. It burnt down on New Year's Day 1985.

"It's a nondescript warehouse on the outskirts of Washington . D.C., but hidden inside are the remains of 100,000 explosives specifically . designed to harm U.S. troops. America's secret 'bomb library' holds many of the improvised explosive devices (IEDs) which have killed hundreds of military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks. They've been collected to help identify individual bomb makers and to develop high-tech responses.

Now, ABC News reports, the FBI and military use the facility to fight terrorists. 'When you really stop to think of what's . in those boxes, it really makes you pause and think of all the troops . wounded... by these devices, and it really is kind of sacred ground,' TEDAC director and FBI supervisory special agent, Gregory Carl, said.

In Afghanistan, IEDs have killed . 954 U.S. troops over the past twelve years of war. In Iraq, 2,207 . Americans were killed by roadside bombs. Tens of thousands . were wounded. According to ABC News' special report, each IED collected is prioritized by . specialized military units in Afghanistan and formerly in Iraq. A code . red item must be examined, photographed and checked for fingerprints or . DNA within five days. Amber cases have to be processed in 30 days and . green packages are considered low-priority. Each IED has its own computer case file, which states the . location and date it was detonated or located and if there . were any casualties. The . IED packages are piled into 3,500 stacked into five-foot-tall white boxes . in the FBI warehouse. About . 800 IEDs are delivered each month from Afghanistan and . about 20 other countries. The FBI archive contains about 40,000 IEDs each from Afghanistan and Iraq, plus another 20,000 shipped from countries such as Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia which are kept in simple cardboard boxes with labels that detail their contents . TEDAC has  reportedly placed 100 . individuals on terror watch lists and identified more than 1,000 . bomb makers. The agency's investigations also led to the high-profile convictions of Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadi. After analyzing thousands of IED parts, TEDAC officials were able to link the men to terrorist activity. Both . Iraqis pleaded guilty to terrorism-related charges last year. The Iraqi men were mistakenly allowed to resettle in . Kentucky in 2009 because flawed background checks failed to discover their past as al Qaeda-Iraq . insurgents.

"Britain’s most notorious prisoner Charles Bronson ‘smeared himself in butter before taking on 12 prison guards’ after Arsenal won the FA Cup, it has emerged. The 61-year-old Tottenham Hotspur fan, who is branded Britain's most violent and dangerous prisoner, admitted he ‘had another rumble’ after the Premier League team beat Hull at Wembley. Bronson, who is serving a life sentence for robbery and kidnap at Full Sutton Prison in York, covered himself in butter - supposedly making it harder for guards to restrain him – before going on the rampage on May 17. Prisoner Charles Bronson, a 61-year-old Tottenham Hotspur fan, admitted covering himself in butter and taking on 12 prison guards after Premier League team Arsenal beat Hull at Wembley in the FA Cup Final on May 17 . In a letter to Kate Kray, the ex-wife of London gangster Ronnie Kray, written two days after the incident, Bronson revealed how he was left with broken ribs after the scuffle. Excerpts from the letter, which was obtained by the Daily Mirror, revealed how he had ‘visions’ of Mrs Kray’s husband, who died in 1995, just before he flew into a rage because of the football result. He wrote: ‘I so wanted Hull to win, coz (sic) I'm Spurs. I got Lurpak and spread it on thick. Then a small cloud appeared. ‘I swear I see Ron’s face. It was eerie. Go on son, let ’em have it! ‘I know the mind plays games in moments of mad events but it is still a comforting thought Ron’s still around.’ Bronson has spent the last 40 years in jail - save just four months and nine days between crimes - with 36 of those years spent in solitary confinement due to his 'aggression'. He was first jailed in 1974, aged 22, . for an armed robbery on a post office and his jail time has been . repeatedly extended for various crimes including taking prisoners . hostage. In a letter to Kate Kray (right), the ex-wife of prolific London gangster Ronnie Kray,  Charles Bronson (left) revealed how he was left with broken ribs after the scuffle at the high security prison on May 17 . The 61-year-old, who is branded Britain's most violent and dangerous prisoner, admitted he 'had another rumble' at Full Sutton prison in York (pictured) Over the years, he has been involved in at least ten jail sieges and the outbursts have seen him moved 150 times. He was given a life sentence in 1999 for holding a prison art teacher hostage for 44 hours for criticising some of his sketches. CCTV footage showed him leading his victim around like a dog with a rope around his neck. He once boasted: ‘I’ve had more hostages than Saddam Hussein’ and reportedly ate a budgie after he became annoyed by its singing. The latest incident comes just months after he allegedly attacked a prison governor at Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes after his artwork was again criticised. Bronson has become a prolific artist . during his time inside and, controversially, his surreal multi-coloured . drawings have sold for up to £1,000 and been displayed in galleries . across London and the south east. Tottenham Hotspur fan Charles Bronson flew into a rage after Premier League giants Arsenal beat Hull in the FA Cup Final at Wembley (pictured) earlier this month . Mrs Kray, 58, from Kent, told the Mirror how Bronson was mortified to discover his mother Eira Peterson, 84, was upset by the alleged attack. She told the newspaper: ‘He got put back in the cage and started drawing Easter bunnies instead of his usual disturbing pictures. But he is really upset that he’s upset his mum. ‘He said, “Can you put my drawings in auction to send my mum on holiday?”’ The . prisoner, who was born Michael Gordon Peterson but changed his name in . 1989 - is due to go on trial for the alleged attack on September 1. Despite . the latest incidents, the muscle-bound convict - who is said to do . 2,000 push-ups a day – recently claimed his violent days ended more than . a decade ago. Charles Bronson's mother Eira Peterson, 84 (pictured), is said to have already been upset by another alleged attack at Woodhill Prison during which the inmate allegedly assaulted a governor .

"Notorious prisoner Charles Bronson has been moved to a different prison after allegedly attacking a prison governor, it has been claimed . Notorious prisoner Charles Bronson has been moved to a different prison and put in a 'punishment cell' after allegedly attacking a prison governor. The 61-year-old was moved to HMP Woodhill, in Buckinghamshire, just before Christmas last year. But he was moved to HMP Wakefield, in West Yorkshire, on Friday after being accused of assaulting a governor at Woodhill, it has been reported. Bronson, who is serving a life sentence for robbery and kidnap, was last week apparently banned from sending out his artwork after prison chiefs at Woodhill said people on the outside were selling it for profit. He has spent 40 years in jail, 36 in solitary, since first being jailed for armed robbery in 1974. He is now in a 'punishment cell' at Wakefield, according to the website of campaign group The Charlie Bronson Appeal Fund. The website claims: 'Woodhil Prison (sic) are alleging that Charlie assaulted a Governor and made threats and have charged him and passed the matter to the police to investigate. 'Charlie's legal team have been made aware of the situation and Charlie fully intends to fight these accusations, citing extreme provocation and duress.' The website also says it has received confirmation from Bronson, who has been dubbed the UK's most violent inmate, that he is back at Wakefield where he was allowed to make an emergency phone call. Bronson has now apparently been moved to HMP Wakefield, in West Yorkshire (pictured) Bronson was moved from HMP Woodhill, in Buckinghamshire, (pictured) after being accused of assaulting a governor . It says: 'He is, however in the . punishment block and at present, unsure how long he will be in . punishment or indeed, at Wakefield. 'There is apparently no cell on the CSC unit so the next few days are full of uncertainty in terms of his location. 'The protocol on the punishment block is that unless he is prepared to come out with his hands on his head and get on his knees, they will not let him out for the hour's exercise he is legally entitled to. 'Charlie has refused to do this, although he is keen to stress that he is cool and being respectful to the staff at Wakefield. Bronson was moved to HMP Wakefield on Friday after being accused of assaulting a governor at HMP Woodhill, according to reports . 'Charlie has nothing in the punishment cell, and has not the opportunity to wash or shave since Friday. We are hopeful this situation will change for the better within the next few days.' Bronson, who has won 11 awards from the Koestler Trust - a prison arts charity - for his drawings and has shows in galleries across London and the south east, has been in solitary for 36 years. He has convictions for wounding, criminal damage, GBH, false imprisonment and blackmail. The Ministry of Justice has said it does not comment on individual prisoners.","Charles Bronson apparently moved from HMP Woodhill to HMP Wakefield .

"Over a thousand exoplanets have so far been found, and the discoveries are coming thick and fast. But the recent find of three super-hot worlds in a stellar city 2,500 light years away has got astronomers particularly excited. One of the new exoplanets is orbiting a star that is a rare solar twin - a star that is almost identical to our sun in all respects. Astronomers have used ESO's HARPS planet hunter in Chile, along with other telescopes around the world, to discover three planets orbiting stars in the cluster Messier 67. Pictured here is an artist's impression of what one of the planet's with a sun like our own might look like . This is the first solar twin in a cluster that has been found to have a planet, and scientists claim there could be many more. Astronomers know that most stars form . out of giant gas clouds in clusters. But up until now, they haven’t . found many planets orbiting stars in clusters. The planet is thought to be about one-third the mass of Jupiter and orbits the star once every 6.9 days. Its surface is likely to be hotter than a blast furnace. The planet, and two others, orbit stars in the open cluster M67, which scientists believe is four billion years old – around the same age as the Earth and the sun. This chart shows the location of the star cluster Messier 67 in the constellation of Cancer (The Crab). This map shows most of the stars that are visible to the unaided eye under good conditions, and the location of the cluster is highlighted with a red circle on the image. This object can be spotted with binoculars and many of its component stars seen with a moderate-sized telescope . Messier 67 (also known as M67 or NGC 2682) is an open stellar cluster in the constellation of Cancer. Age estimates for the cluster range between 3.2 and 5 billion years. Only few known open clusters were found to be older, among them probably NGC 188 at about 5 billion years. M67 is the nearest old open cluster, and has become a standard example for studying stellar evolution. The cluster has more than 100 stars similar to the sun, and countless red giants. The total star count has been estimated at well over 500. The recent finding revealed the first solar twin in a cluster that has been found to have a planet. Only a handful of planets have been found orbiting stars so similar to the sun - such as HD 187123 and HD 86226 - but none in a cluster. The finding shows that stars just like the sun can form planets and that they can do so even when in a stellar cluster, where it’s relatively crowded. Anna Brucalassi from the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Garching, Germany, and lead author of the new study, said her team wanted to find out more. ‘In the Messier 67 star cluster the stars are all about the same age and composition as the sun. ‘This makes it a perfect laboratory to study how many planets form in such a crowded environment, and whether they form mostly around more massive or less massive stars.’ The team used the HARPS planet-finding instrument on ESO's 3.6-metre telescope at the La Silla Observatory. They carefully monitored 88 selected stars in M67 over a period of six years to look for the tiny tell-tale motions of the stars towards and away from Earth that reveal the presence of orbiting planets. Many of the cluster stars are fainter than those normally targeted for exoplanet searches and trying to detect the weak signal from possible planets pushed HARPS to the limit. ‘These new results show that planets in open star clusters are about as common as they are around isolated stars - but they are not easy to detect,’ said Luca Pasquini, from the European Southern Observatory. ‘The new results are in contrast to earlier work that failed to find cluster planets, but agrees with some other more recent observations,’ he added. ‘We are continuing to observe this cluster to find how stars with and without planets differ in mass and chemical makeup.’ Messier 67 (also known as M67 or NGC 2682) is an open stellar cluster in the constellation of Cancer. Age estimates for the cluster range between 3.2 and 5 billion years .","One of the planets orbits a star similar to our sun once every 6.9 days .

"Comet ISON took us on a roller coaster ride last year when it swung perilously close to the sun. Scientists all over the world were on the edge of their seats, urging the comet to survive its close encounter. But the optimistically-named 'comet of the century' was pronounced dead in December causing astronomers to mourn the loss of the sky show that once promised to light up Earth. Now ISON could have another trick . up its sleeve. Scientists believe an unusual meteor shower from the comet could . hit Earth tonight. Scroll down for video... Paul Wiegert's model of the Comet ISON debris stream and how it will hit Earth's orbit . Meteor researcher Paul Wiegert of the University of Western Ontario has been using a computer to model the trajectory of dust ejected by the comet. According to his computer models, the debris stream is populated with extremely tiny grains of dust, no more than a few microns wide. Pushed toward Earth by the gentle radiation pressure of the sun, they will be hitting at a speed of 125,000 mph (56 km/s). Because the particles are so small, Earth’s upper atmosphere will rapidly slow them to a stop. Scientists now believe an unusual meteor shower from comet ISON could hit Earth tonight. This image shows the position of the radiant for any possible ISON debris in Leo . In this frame grab taken from an enhanced video made by Nasa's STEREO-A spacecraft, comet ISON, left, approaches the sun on November 25 . Scientist at the Vostok Antarctic . station are currently in place to gather any dust from the comet ISON to . help them find the 'basic building blocks' of life. Dust gathering can take place the . Antarctic because the air over the polar continent is cleaner compared . to more inhabited locations. The scientists plan to use five . 150-square metre polyethylene canvases as traps.  Each trap will be . unrolled and left in the hope that some comet particulates would fall on . it. Then they will be preserved in . chemically inert argon gas and shipped to St. Petersburg for microscopic . study, which is expected to start in May. ‘Instead of burning up in a flash of light, they will drift gently down to the Earth below,’ said Professor Wiegert. Scientists are unsure exactly when or if the meteor shower will happen, but have estimated that it may reach its peak tonight. The invisible rain of comet dust, if it occurs, would be very slow. It can take months or even years for fine dust to settle out of the high atmosphere. But while the dust is in the atmosphere it could produce noctilucent clouds (NLCs). NLCs are icy clouds that glow electric-blue as they float more than 80 km above Earth's poles. Data from Nasa’s AIM spacecraft suggests that NLCs are seeded by space dust. Tiny meteoroids act as nucleating points where water molecules gather; the resulting ice crystals assemble into clouds at the edge of space itself. This is still speculative, but Comet ISON could provide the seeds for a noctilucent display. Electric-blue ripples over Earth's polar regions might be the only visible sign that a shower is underway. Ahile the dust is in the atmosphere it could produce noctilucent clouds such as the ones seen here . ISON, which has been dubbed the 'comet of the century', was visible to the naked eye in November . Comet ISON headed towards the centre of our solar system in Novermber passing within 1.2 million miles of the sun’s surface. At the time of discovery in September 2012, ISON was over 584 million miles from the sun. Its average speed in July was 55,405mph. It continued to accelerate steadily until November when it whipped around the sun at an astonishing 425,000mph. After much speculation, the optimistically-named ‘comet of the century’ was pronounced dead in December after its close encounter with our star. Astronomers who had followed the ice ball mourned the loss of the sky show that once promised to light up during December. Scientists now believe an unusual meteor shower from the comet's remains could . hit Earth tonight. Professor Wiegert notes another strange event: ‘The shower is going to hit our planet from two directions at once.’ When Earth passes through the debris stream, we will encounter two populations of comet dust. One swarm of dust will be following the Comet ISON into the sun. Another swarm will be moving in the opposite direction, pushed away from the sun by solar radiation pressure. The streams will pepper opposite sides of Earth simultaneously. ‘In my experience, this kind of double whammy is unprecedented,’ he said. Bill Cooke, lead scientist at Nasa’s Meteoroid Environment Office, added there's little danger to Earth-orbiting spacecraft. ‘These particles are just too small to penetrate the walls of our satellites, and they don't stand a chance against the heavy shielding of the ISS.’ However, he adds, mission operators will be alert this week for possible anomalies. Scientist at the Vostok Antarctic station are already in place to gather any dust from the comet ISON to help them find the 'basic building blocks' of life. Noctilucent clouds (NLCs)  are icy clouds that glow electric-blue as they float more than 80 km above Earth's poles. Data from Nasa¿s AIM spacecraft suggests that NLCs are seeded by space dust . Sergey Bulat from St. Petersburg Institute of Nuclear Physics, told RIA Novosti:‘We expected the comet to survive and hoped to gather some large particulates in December. ‘Now if we get something, it would be particulates from the coma [the major part of the head of a comet] and tail left when it was approaching the sun,’ he said. Dust gathering can take place the Antarctic because the air over the polar continent is cleaner compared to more inhabited locations. The scientists plan to use five 150-square metre polyethylene canvases as traps.  Each trap will be unrolled and left in the hope that some comet particulates would fall on it. Then they will be preserved in chemically inert argon gas and shipped to St. Petersburg for microscopic study, which is expected to start in May. Nasa said sky watchers should also be on alert. The odds of seeing anything are low, but comet ISON could be full of surprises. Last year the 'comet of the century' was spotted on a trajectory towards the sun before appearing to disappear, yet shortly afterwards bright lights (pictured top left) were spotted that some scientists have claimed could be the comet's nucleus .","Debris could be hitting Earth tonight at a speed of 125,000 mph (56 km/s)

"Slaughtered: Marmite the micro pig, pictured, was loaned to a school because he was lonely at home . A woman who loaned her beloved micro pig to a local school to stop the animal getting lonely was shocked to find out her pet had been sent to slaughter. Ria Dell, 21, was given Marmite as a present, but 'loaned' him to a local infant school so he would no longer be stuck in the house and could meet other pigs. Miss Dell, who works in a sweet shop, would visit her 'docile' porcine friend several times a week in his new home at West Rise Junior School in Eastbourne, Sussex - but one day he was no longer in his pen. When she investigated Marmite's fate, the school revealed that they had sent the animal off to be killed because of his 'aggressive' behaviour. It is claimed he bit a school site manager and even tried to attack a pupil. Miss Dell, who says Marmite was only loaned to the school, was 'devastated' by the news, and says they had no right to kill her pet. However, officials from the school have claimed they were within their rights to take the drastic step, consulted a vet first and even asked Miss Dell to take the pig back. Scroll down for video . Beloved pet: Ria Dell, pictured with Marmite, maintains the school had no right to send her pig to die . Vegetarian Miss Dell said: 'I have loved pigs since I was a child and they were always my favourite animal. 'My parents bought me Marmite as a present for my 21st birthday and I was ecstatic. I treated him very much like a pet rather than livestock and he lived in the house with us as a member of the family. 'He was so soft and domesticated that he . would sit on my lap in front of the TV, and let me stroke him. He would . even give me kisses and cuddles. When you called his name, he would . recognise it and come running like a dog. Devastated: Ria Dell is pictured above outside the enclosure where she used to visit her porcine friend . 'Docile': Miss Dell described how her pig was calm and loving, although school officials say he bit a member of staff . 'Unfortunately, it became clear he was a little lonely and I thought he would benefit from socialising with other pigs. You would not be alone in thinking that Marmite seems on the large size for a micro pig. However the animals, which shot to popularity because of their pint-sized reputation, are only truly tiny when they are piglets. Adult micro pigs can easily grow to knee-height, and some shocked owners have had to content with the beasts growing even larger and causing chaos at home. 'I contacted West Rise school because I knew they had other animals and they said they would be delighted to take him. 'They had a female pig they wanted to mate and they said Marmite would make the perfect stud. 'I took him to the school on the understanding he would be boarding there. I wasn’t giving them ownership. I thought he would have a dream new start in life with some other pigs to keep him company.' Marmite was placed into a pen with two other pigs in January this year, and within two months he was dead. Miss Dell said: 'I visited him at the school three times a week and my mum would drive past every day. 'You could see him from the pathway outside the school, so I never needed to go in. However, one day we realised he had disappeared, which was extremely worrying. New home: Marmite was sent to the school so that he could mix with other pigs. He is pictured left in the enclosure . Dispute: The school says it was within its rights to kill Marmite, and tried to offer him back to Miss Dell first . Relocated: Marmite was sent to West Rise Junior School, pictured, where he lived with other pigs . 'The school told us he had been aggressive towards the other pigs and moved to a separate pen. However, he was so docile and half the size of the ones they had. 'The school’s other male was older than Marmite and even had tusks.' Miss Dell said she offered to take Marmite back or help to find him another home, though the school disputes this. 'Devastated': Miss Dell would visit her porcine friend three times a week until his unexpected demise . But she also claims the school then sent him to slaughter at Tottingworth Farm in nearby Broad Oak without letting her know. She said: 'When I found out Marmite had been killed I was devastated. I couldn’t believe it and I was just screaming. The school had no right to kill my pet, who I loved so much. People should imagine how they would feel if somebody did that to their dog.' The school said it removed the pig upon the recommendation of a vet and attempted to find suitable housing for him on another site. Headteacher Mike Fairclough said: 'After a few weeks the new pig became extremely aggressive and attacked our two other pigs. It also bit the site manager and tried to bite a child. 'We contacted our vet and were advised to remove the pig from our site for the health and safety of the children and the other animals. 'The previous owners were contacted by the school to notify them of this development, but at no point did they offer to have it back or to help rehouse it. 'Our farm manager approached as many local farms as possible to rehouse the pig, but nobody wanted it because it was a boar.'","Marmite the micro pig used to live with doting owner Ria Dell, 21 .

"Two of Britain's top teenage sailors crashed into each other during a late-night journey, leaving a schoolgirl who was travelling with them brain-damaged, a court heard today. Nia Jones and Elleni Morus, who have both represented Great Britain, were in charge of a group of 24 girls aged between 10 and 14 when they themselves were aged 17. Their two boats collided in darkness when they were returning to their hostel after a day's sailing on Cardiff Bay during a half-term residential course. Four young passengers were thrown from the boats, and one suffered severe brain injuries, Cardiff Crown Court was told. Trial: Elleni Morus, left, and Nia Jones, right, are accused of acting recklessly before a boat collision . Crash: This is one of the boats involved in the collision during a half-term sailing trip in October 2010 . The jury heard that the girls had been urging Jones to go faster moments before the two inflatable speedboats crashed. Prosecutor Oliver Willmott said that four boats had illegally set off across the bay without using lights. 'Two of the four boats were more powerful than the others and the defendants ran to the top of the slipway in order to get them,' he said. 'Nicholas Sawyer was the chief instructor of the sailing course and he told the girls to be sensible. In fact, he said: ""Don't f*** around.""' Danger: The other boat involved in the crash, which took place when the boats did not have lights attached . Experienced: Morus and Jones were aged just 17 at the time of the accident, but were among the top young sailors in the country . In previous days, the boats had been used for 'wake jumping', the court heard. Mr Willmott said: 'This is where each boat jumps the other's wake for a thrill ride. It is also quite a potentially dangerous thing to do. 'In the boat driven by Jones, there was effectively a request made by one or two people in the boat that they go faster, jump waves and swerve. 'There came a point where Jones came across the path of Morus and they collided. 'It was a sufficiently violent collision to throw two people into the water and to cause a third person to fall halfway into the water. A fourth young girl was thrown from one boat and landed in the other. 'In the most severe case, a young girl suffered a brain injury of moderate severity.' The victim, an 11-year-old girl, has not been named. Court: Morus and Jones pictured with friends and family outside Cardiff Crown Court today . Holiday: The pair were supervising a group of schoolgirls doing a residential course at Cardiff Bay, pictured . Instructor Nicholas Sawyer and Cardiff Bay Yacht Club, organisers of the course in October 2010, have already admitted offences in connection with the accident. The court heard that Jones and Morus were not qualified to drive the high-powered boats at night. Mr Willmott told the jury: 'These girls were in a difficult position. They were 17 and had been coached in sailing to some considerable success by Nicholas Sawyer. 'It was his idea to cross Cardiff Bay without lights at night and they did what he said. But did this collision just happen because of Nicholas Sawyer and the sailing club's bad plan - or because there was excess speed and a failure to keep a proper look out? 'If you know you are close to other boats and without lights then you should be driving very carefully. It's common sense and it's good seamanship.' Morus and Jones, both 20, admit piloting the boats without navigation lights, but deny failing to travel at a safe speed and failing to keep a proper lookout. The trial continues.

"Richard Jeferies shed the weight in a . little over 12 months . Dropped from more than 24 . stone to a much healthier 16st 9lbs . Says getting stuck on rollercoaster and being called 'fat man' by child in shop was the push he needed . A man has lost almost 8 stone in just a year after being so large that he got stuck in a theme park ride. Richard Jeferies from Street, Sheerness was shamed into losing more than seven stone after almost getting stuck in a theme park ride and having a child point him out as a 'fat man'. Richard, 48, tipped . the scales at 24 stone but only realised he had a problem after getting . wedged in 'Sonic Spinball' at Alton Towers. Richard was shamed into losing more than seven stone after almost getting stuck in a theme park ride and having a child point him out as a 'fat man' The father-of-four was at the theme park with his daughter Isabella, 8. when he struggled to fit into the ride. Staff had to stamp on the bar to make it lock around Richard which meant he struggled to breathe. And when the carriage finally came to a stop overweight Richard was left wedged in the seat and had to be heaved out by staff. He says he was spurred on by the embarrassing experience and immediately . launched a fitness regime of eating salads and hitting the gym. In just over a year he has shed 7st 13lbs and now weighs a much healthier 16st 9lbs. Richard, from Sheerness, Kent, said: 'When we sat in the car the attendant . could not get the bar to go down so he was stamping on it. Richard Jeferies has gone from tipping the scales at more than 24 stone to a much healthier 16st 9lbs . 'I had to decide whether it was more embarrassing to get off or wait while they tried to stamp it on. 'I could barely breathe. It was spinning round and I thought 'they are going to be taking a corpse off this'. 'I swore I would never go on a ride again. It was those little triggers that made me realise.' Richard, a theatre volunteer, said on another occasion he was mortified . when he heard a little girl in a supermarket car park point at him and . say: 'look mummy, a fat man'. He said: 'When I heard the little girl say I was fat I was really hurt. I was too upset to turn round so I just kept walking. 'If someone had said to me I would be eating salad for lunch and going . to the gym three times a week I would never have believed them.

"A machete-wielding thug is one of three more criminals to go on the run from open prisons over the Bank Holiday weekend. Lewis Powter, 30, is serving an indeterminate sentence for public protection after  he used a 3ft knife to slash open the arm of his sister’s former boyfriend. Police warned the public not to approach him after he absconded from Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk. Violent: Lewis Powter, 30, left, was jailed indefinitely after nearly hacking off a man’s arm with a machete. He is the second prisoner to escape from Hollesley Bay in two days after Paul Oddysses, right,  escaped on Saturday . Prison officers discovered he had escaped and sounded the alert when he failed to turn up for the 8pm roll call on Sunday. Powter . – who has a tattoo of Dennis the Menace on his right arm – was jailed . in 2007 for the attack, during which he shouted that he was going to . ‘kill’ his sister’s former partner. He . used the machete to inflict a 10in gash on the elbow of his victim, who . was left needing 28 stitches and a metal plate in his arm, Cambridge . Crown Court heard. Psychiatric and probation reports concluded that . Powter posed a ‘medium to high risk’ to the public. Missing: Wayne Mcleod went missing from Springhill Prison in Buckinghamshire on Sunday evening . On the run: Powter, 30, was being detained at Hollesley Bay open prison in Suffolk (pictured) but failed to turn up to the evening roll check on Sunday . He . has a long history of  violence, and previously served an 18-month jail . sentence for spraying a nightclub bouncer with CS gas. It is thought he . could be in Cambridgeshire. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said there will be 'no nonsense' over the naming of on-the-run criminals whose identities had been kept secret by Government officials. Thirteen out of 18 missing convicts, whose identities had been withheld because Government officials believed it would be 'unfair' to publish them, have now been named. Mr Grayling stated that data protection laws will not be used to protect them, arguing: ' They are wanted men and should be treated as such. 'That's why on my watch we will not hold back their names, unless the police ask us not to for operational reasons.' It comes after a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Mail to release the identities of missing prisoners had been rejected by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) - without considering whether it would be in the public interest to release the information. The request was made after armed robbed Michael Wheatley - known as 'skull cracker' - absconded while on temporary release from an open prison three weeks ago. Mr Grayling said: 'The police catch most of them quickly. Even so, I think the rules in open prisons have been too lax and I am tightening them. 'They'll be more stringent risk assessments, and anyone who absconds will get a longer sentence and will be banned from going back to an open prison. 'From the end of this year, we'll also use GPS tags to monitor where they are.' He also suggested the number of people absconding from open prisons is a 'small fraction' of what it was ten years ago. When . he was last seen, about an hour before his escape, he was wearing a . blue jumper over a white T-shirt, blue jeans and white Ralph Lauren . trainers. A Suffolk Police spokesman said: ‘Police are asking anyone who . may have seen him or anyone with information about where he is to . contact officers. ‘You should not approach him or take any further action.’ Powter . was the second prisoner to go on the run from Hollesley Bay in less . than 48 hours. Paul Oddysses, 49, who is serving a life sentence for . attempted robbery and robbery with a firearm, absconded at about 12.30pm . on Saturday. He has a scar on the back of his head and tattoos on both arms, and has connections to Hertfordshire and Essex. A . third inmate, Wayne McLeod, 36, escaped from Springhill open prison in . Buckinghamshire between 5.15pm and 8.15pm on Sunday. Thames Valley . Police did not reveal why he was in jail but said he may now be in . Reading, Berkshire. News of . the latest absconders will heighten public concerns about the series of . prison breaks since armed robber Michael ‘Skullcracker’ Wheatley failed . to return to Standford Hill open prison in Kent on May 3 after being . allowed out. He has since been recaptured. The . Daily Mail yesterday revealed the identities of 13 criminals who went . on the run between May 2010 and March 2013 after Justice Secretary Chris . Grayling intervened to end the ‘nonsense’ of their names being kept . secret. A Ministry of . Justice spokesman said Mr Grayling had ordered ‘immediate and major . changes’ to tighten up temporary release processes and open prison . eligibility. The spokesman . added that absconds had reached record lows under this Government and . were 80 per cent down over the past ten years.","Lewis Powter, 30, was jailed indefinitely after the attack on Luke Shepherd .

"Heather Watson plans to talk to doctors about an occasionally recurring virus type symptoms that helped sink her Australian Open hopes this morning. The euphoria of her weekend title win in Hobart was to be short-lived as her stay in the season's opening Grand Slam event singles proved contrastingly short. The British No 1, complaining of nausea and blurred vision, was bundled out of the first round by Tsvetana Pironkova 6-4, 6-0 in 83 minutes on what was a more humid day in the Victorian capital. Heather Watson was struggling with nausea as she crashed out to Tsvetana Pironkova . Watson was not at her best as she was knocked out in the first round . Watson had to call for both the trainer and doctor during her defeat by Pironkova . Watson was unable to reproduce the form that saw her win in Hobart at the weekend . Watson looks disappointed as she goes out in the first round as Pironkova celebrates . Afterwards Watson explained: 'Yesterday I woke up not feeling that great and today I struggled on the court to have energy. Against any player here it's tough enough when you're fit.' In 2013 she suffered from glandular fever, although does not feel the sporadic bouts of lethargy are related to that: 'I have one or two days when I feel like this here and there. I'm going to see the doctor but I think it's just the way my body works. 'It's very frustrating, especially as this is one of those times I want all my energy. It sucks.' She still plans to play in the doubles before heading home. Pironkova took just over an hour and 20 minutes to beat Watson in the first round in Melbourne . Pironkova looked good with her groundstrokes as she progressed 6-4, 6-0 . Watson shakes hands with Pironkova after her defeat in the first round of the Australian Open . Watson started shakily and then called on both the trainer and doctor for treatment when she was trailing 2-5 in the first set. The treatment and delay briefly seemed to galvanise her as she got back to 4-5, but once Pironkova had closed out the first set the match ran away quickly. Certainly this was not the usual kind of performance from the 22 year-old Channel Islander, who on Saturday collected her second WTA Tour title in Tasmania which carried her to a career high ranking of 38. She particularly struggled with her serve, landing only 46 per cent of her first deliveries in and was unable to take advantage of the brief bouts of inconsistency of her opponent, who was cheered on by a noisy enclave of Bulgarian fans around the Spartan outside court. It is easy to see why Pironkova has done especially well at Wimbledon (where she has been a semi and quarter finalist) as her groundstrokes, struck with her long levers, are especially flat and penetrating. Watson looked very deflated afterwards, her defeat meaning British interest in the women's singles ending by lunchtime on the second day.","Heather Watson suffered from nausea and blurred vision during her defeat .

"Loss: Shanice Clark, 21, was found unresponsive in her dorm in Pennsylvania early on Sunday morning . A college basketball star has been found dead in her dorm room after choking on gum in her sleep, preliminary investigations have found. Shanice Clark, from Toronto, Canada, was found unresponsive at 3.03am on Sunday in Vulcan Village at the California University of Pennsylvania, the Washington County coroner's office said. She was rushed to Monongahela Valley Hospital but she could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 4.10am. Police said a preliminary report from medical personnel indicates Clark accidentally choked on gum while she was sleeping, the Pennsylvania Observer-Reporter reported. The manner of death continues to remain under investigation. University officials said they were 'deeply saddened' by the death of the 6-foot senior forward, who had played two dozen games for the Vulcans last season. Athletic director Karen Hjerpe called Clark 'a bright student and talented player' and said 'her smile and personality will be missed'. Clark, a communications major, had hoped to become a broadcaster and chose the school because of its good facilities after transferring from Santa Fe College in Florida. But friend Cleveland Clunis told the Toronto Star that she would often joke that she had gone to the university for a different reason. 'For Shanice, it was, ""There's a good hairstylist"",' said Clunis, the founder of a non-profit basketball program she had attended. 'When she shares that with you, you can't help but laugh.' He said that this sense of humor had made her popular among students and staff. 'She could start a conversation with you from morning and still have you laughing and interested till sundown,' he said. Geraldine M. Jones, interim university president, said in a statement: 'Our thoughts today are with the family of Shanice Clark, a senior from Ontario, Canada, who passed away early this morning. 'On behalf of California University of Pennsylvania, I extend my deepest sympathy to all of Shanice's family and friends. She will be missed by her teammates and coaches, her classmates, and by the entire campus community.' Clark leaves behind her mother, Kashaeka Fearon, and a younger sister.

"A man has described how his leg swelled up and erupted in blisters after he went to examine a ‘pretty plant’ that his wife had seen. Keith Cooper did not realise that they had stumbled across giant hogweed and was hit by the plant’s toxic sap after stepping on one of its leaf stalks. He had to be taken to hospital where he was told he could not expose his injured right leg to sunlight for seven years. Poison: Keith Cooper from Howdon, Tyne & Wear, shows his injured leg as he rests at home . Mr Cooper, 50, was out for a stroll in Whitley Bay, near Newcastle upon Tyne, with his 49-year-old wife, Maria Graham when she spotted the plant in the undergrowth. ‘We were walking the dog near the coast road when my wife stopped to admire a plant and she asked if we could have one for our garden,’ the father-of-two said. ‘The sap rubbed against me but I didn’t realise as it didn’t hurt. I just thought I had been bitten. It was only when I got home that my right leg flared up and it started blistering.’ Unable to walk without limping, Mr Cooper, a former dispensing optician, went to hospital where his condition at first baffled doctors. ‘The consultant said she he had never seen anything like it,’ he said. Damaging plant: Giant Hogweed - Herocleum Mantegazziamum can grow up to 16ft tall . After a while doctors were able to identify the cause of the blistering as a giant hogweed. Mr Cooper, from Howdon in Newcastle, said: ‘They told me I can’t put my leg in the sun for the next seven years. If my leg goes into the sun it blisters again because the injury has taken all the skin’s natural UV protection away. I will have to go round with one sock on.’ He had developed phytophotodermatitis – a disorder which makes skin hypersensitive to ultraviolet light and can last for years. Giant hogweed sap contains toxic chemicals known as photosensitising furanocoumarins, which react with light when in contact with human skin, causing blistering within 48 hours. Effectively the toxic sap prevents the skin from protecting itself from sunlight, which can lead to very bad sunburn and scarring. Damaged: Mr Cooper cannot expose his injured leg to direct sunlight for seven years after the poisonous sap destroyed his skin's UV protection . If accidentally rubbed in the eyes, the sap can cause temporary or even permanent blindness. Anyone who comes in contact with the weed is advised to cover up the affected area, to prevent the sap reacting with sunlight, and to wash it with soap and water. Giant hogweed, an invasive species that . resembles native cow parsley or hogweed, has large leaves, spotted leaf . stalks and a hollow, reddish-purple stem with fine spines that make it . appear furry, much like a stinging nettle . Giant hogweed is part of the carrot family, but it can grow up to 16ft tall. It is found in most of the UK, often near rivers and canals – the seeds spread on waterways as well as being dispersed by birds and people. The weed’s scientific name, Heracleum mantegazzianum, comes from the Greek hero Hercules – famed for his strength and size. A native of the Caucasus mountains and central Asia, it was introduced to Britain in the 19th century as an ornamental plant and is resistant to frost. Giant hogweed can take four years to flower. When it does so, in June and July, it has 20in wide flower heads filled with small white blooms. A single flower head can have 5,000 seeds, with each plant producing up to 80,000 seeds. After shedding its seeds the plant normally dies. It is commonly found along rivers and canals as well as beside footpaths and roads. Guy Barter, chief horticultural adviser at the Royal Horticultural Society, said the plant was introduced as an ornamental garden plant in the 19th century, but then spread rapidly into the wild where it now proliferates. ‘Sadly, once imported, it didn’t stay in the garden, and it was quickly out in the environment, with its seeds floating off along watercourses,’ he said. ‘You can immediately recognise it because it is much bigger than the native species, and has a thick bristly stem and often purple blotches. ‘As a rule, the plant is benign, but it has a particularly annoying property – the sap can cause injury when combined with sunlight.’ Gardeners wanting to tackle the giant weed are advised to wear gloves and overalls, and use secateurs not a strimmer, to prevent the sap coming in contact with the skin. They should only try to get rid of it when the weather is cloudy. ‘The sap is only activated by sunlight, so if you want to clear giant hogweed, then make sure it is a dull day,’ said Mr Barter. Seedlings and young plants can be hand pulled, while larger plants can be cut down to ground level or may be dug out.","Keith Cooper stepped on a giant hogweed stalk while dog-walking .

"Tunisia and Cape Verde Islands shared the spoils in their opening match in Ebebiyin, as all four teams in Group B go into the second round of games level on a single point. In a game lacking quality, Mohamed Ali Moncer put the Tunisians ahead after 70 minutes, before Heldon Ramos equalized from the penalty spot to secure Cape Verde a deserved draw. The spot-kick was heavily disputed by the Carthage Eagles, who claimed, with some justification, that Heldon both went to ground very easily, and that any contact there came outside the area. The Tunisia team celebrate after Mohamed Ali Moncer's goal put them 1-0 up in their first match on Sunday . Ali Moncer's goal looked as though it would put Tunisia top of Group B, but they could only manage a point . Tunisia (4-4-2): Aymen Mathlouthi; Hamza Mathlouthi, Abdennour, Ben Youssef, Maaloul; Akaichi (Rjaibi 82), Saihi (Ragued 87), Nater, Khazri (Msakni 82); Chikahoui, Ali Moncer . Goal: Ali Moncer 70 . Booked: Khazri 15 . Cape Verde (4-3-3): Josimar; Stopira, Varela, Gege, Carltios (Mendes 75); Babanco, Calu, Nuno Rocha; Heldon, Djaniny (Julio Tavares 68), Kuca (Fortes 84) Goal: Heldon 77 . Referee: Eric Arnaud Otogo-Castane . It was perhaps fitting that the first match of this competition to fall below a high standard of play should have seen the result settled by the competition's first seriously controversial decision. Matters were not helped by the pitch, laid shortly before the tournament began and obviously not up to the rigours of back-to-back matches. At one point, when Ali Moncer slid to get onto the end of a cross he brought up a divot more than a foot long. Tunisia, favourites to top the group before play started, did little to justify the tag, save for a short spell midway through the second half in which they hit the bar, and scored the goal. But, Cape Verde had by far the better chances, particularly in what was a decidedly lacklustre first half. Tunisia midfielder Yassine Chikhaoui (right) challenges Cape Verde's Nuno Rocha during the Group B match . Rocha (left) is stopped in his tracks by Tunisia's Aymen Abdennour during the match in Ebebiyin . In just the second minute Fernando Varela thundered a header against the post, with Aymen Mathlouthi in the Tunisia goal well beaten. For the first time in the tournament both the intensity of the football, and the atmosphere, was lacking. The Blue Sharks’ front three attempted to inject some life into it. Heldon Ramos and Kuca, two wingers based in Portugal, in particular posed a threat with their pace and trickery. Kuca was the first to test Mathlouthi in the 18th minute, stinging the palms of the Tunisia keeper at the near post, moments after a jinking run that roused the sleepy crowd. On the half hour mark the lively Heldon, who plays his club football at Sporting Lisbon, got free down the right, avoiding a dangerously high foot from Aymen Abdennour, but when he picked out Djaniny the striker could only fire low at Mathlouthi. Soon after Cape Verde keeper Josimar had to be alert to dive at the feet of Mohamed Ali Moncer, but the Tunisians carried little in the way of goal threat. Ali Maaloul (left) is sent flying as Cape Verde scorer Heldon comes away with the ball on Sunday . Tunisia's Syam Ben Youssef (right) leaps with Cape Verde's Jailton Miranda during their Group B opener . The Islanders, the smallest country in Nations Cup history, continued to come forward, Babanco playing a lovely pass for Djaniny down the right hand channel five minutes later, but the striker couldn’t seem to make up his mind between crossing for a well-placed Heldon, or going for goal. In this end, his attempt floated close to the far post, over Aymen Mathlouthi, but just beyond the target. Then, seven minutes before half time, Tunisia survived a moment of controversy, when Ali Maaloul avoided giving away a penalty, or receiving a red card, when he brought down Heldon, who was bursting through on goal. Nuno Rocha picked out his forward with a lovely pass, and when the Sporting man was brought down on the edge of the box, Gabonese referee Eric Castane correctly awarded a free kick, despite claims it was inside the penalty area. However, the full back was fortunate not to be shown a card, given the run Heldon was making towards goal. From the resultant free-kick Babanco smashed a shot into the wall, sparking a goalmouth scramble from which Kuca poked wide. The Tunisian team, favourites to top Group B, line up ahead of their opening Africa Cup of Nations match . Cape Verde, who are the smallest country in Africa Cup of Nations history, line up ahead of the game . Kuca had the second half’s first good chance, almost capping off a flowing break from Cape Verde, but having beaten Mathlouhi he saw Sayim Ben Youssef clear off the line. Tunisia finally began to threaten soon after the hour mark. First Chickhaoui beat Josimar to a free kick only to see his header rattled the woodwork. The ball was bundled in from the rebound, but by that time the referee had spotted a foul. Seven minutes later they had the ball in the net again, this time legally. Full back Ali Maloul got forward down the left and slid an inviting ball across goal, which Ali Moncer converted at the far post, firing into the roof of the net. The celebrations were shortlived however, and despite the controversial nature of the penalty, it was no less than Cape Verde deserved.","Earlier in the day, DR Congo drew 1-1 with Zambia in Group B .

"Yannick Bolasie put in a stunning display as the Democratic Republic of Congo began their Africa Cup of Nations campaign with a hard-fought draw against a resilient Zambia. The Crystal Palace winger, who has been in superb form in the Premier League this season, was the creative force in a team set-up to attack, and was rewarded with a second-half goal, which cancelled out Given Singluama’s early strike. On the first match-day outside of the country’s two major cities, and without the hosts playing any part, there was some concern that Ebebiyin’s stadium might be empty for the Group B clashes.

Those doubts proved to be unfounded, however, as locals and travelling supporters alike packed out the small ground in the jungle city, overfilling the stands to such an extent that some fans were moved into the press box to find them seats. It took Zambia, the Cup of Nations winners in 2012, just 62 seconds to take the lead, when Robert Kidiaba in the Congo goal made a hash of punching away a cross from the left hand side, and Singuluma curled in from the edge of the box. The men in green were always likely to sit back and play to their strengths on the counter-attack, where Southampton’s Emmanuel Mayuka was a constant threat, and the early goal allowed them to adopt their favoured gameplan and frustrate the Congolese side. Bolasie was the biggest threat in a DR Congo side that lined up with an all-out front four, but he was hindered by a Chipolopolo defence that conceded just twice during qualification, and a pitch that cut up at an alarming rate. There were concerns before the game that the stadium would not be full for Zambia v DR Congo . Fans were in jubilant spirits ahead of the first game of Group B at the African Cup of Nations . The Palace winger was still able to create an early chance for striker Herve Kage, but the centre forward couldn’t get the ball out of his feet. The Leopards kept attacking throughout the first half, and were almost handed a goal by Zambia keeper Kennedy Mweene, who spilled a cross straight to Dieudonne Mbokani, only for the striker to blaze over from 6 yards. Mweene more than made up for his early error though, saving well from both a Bolasie drive and an Mbokani header. The one time the Zambian keeper was beaten in the first period, by a deflected Bolasie free kick, the ball squirmed inches wide of the post. As the game wore on the men in white seemed to be running out of ideas, the Zambian defence living up to their mean-spiritied reputation.

But, when a slip by Zambia left back Chisamba Lungu gifted possession to Mabwati, the Chipolopolo were exposed. He picked out Bolasie on the edge of the box, and the winger curled it beautifully into the top corner. Suddenly the chances started to flow, substitute Junior Kabananga threatening with a couple of strikes from the edge of the box, before a spectacular Mbokani bicycle kick was saved by Mweene. But neither side could fashion a winner, and were forced to share the points ahead of games against Cape Verde and Tunisia.","Given Singuluma put Zambia ahead with low strike after only 62 seconds .

"Rafael Nadal sounded a note of caution ahead of his return to grand slam action in the Australian Open, especially after being handed a tricky first round clash in Melbourne. Nadal won his ninth French Open title last year, but lost in the fourth round of Wimbledon and then spent almost three months on the sidelines with a wrist injury that forced him to miss the US Open. After returning to action the 28-year-old was diagnosed with appendicitis and underwent an operation at the start of November, leaving him unsure about how he will fare against unpredictable Russian Mikhail Youzhny when the first grand slam of 2015 gets under way on Monday.

'Every match is tough for me as it is like we are starting everything again. We will see how I am. I am doing the right things in practice to try to be competitive and I am confident with the last few days that remain I can improve my performance and hopefully be ready. 'Every match is tough when you are in shape, so imagine when you have hardly played for six or seven months.

"Juventus general director Giuseppe Marotta has claimed Real Madrid ARE interested in signing midfielder Paul Pogba. Carlo Ancelotti told Sky Italia that he was an admirer of the 21-year-old, but insisted the Champions League winners did not intend to make a move for the former Manchester United youngster. However, Maratto has accused Ancelotti of telling a 'white lie' and insists the Italian has made enquiries about Pogba. Juventus claim Real Madrid have shown an interest in midfielder Paul Pogba . Carlo Ancelotti has been accused of telling a 'white lie' after he denied interest in his compatriot . 'Ancelotti asked me some questions about Pogba,' he said to Sky Italia. 'He says he's not interested? Well, that's a white lie. I'm sure he has his reasons to say it's not true.' Juve are desperate to fend off interest in the French international, but Marotta insists they are powerless to stop Pogba, who has scored five goals  in 16 Serie A games this season, being lured elsewhere with a massive financial offer. He added: 'We will do everything within out limits to hold on to Pogba, but we must not forget Italy is a country in transition. Juventus are desperate to keep Pogba at the San Siro but admit he may be prized away . 'The problem we have is that of offers coming in from other clubs offering him a salary that we are not able to match due to our financial situation. 'At the moment, there's no reason to believe that Pogba will definitely leave Juventus for another team, but we have to bear in mind that we cannot compete with the wages that are being paid elsewhere.

"Francis Coquelin has earned himself a place in Arsene Wenger’s long-term midfield plans thanks to his improved recent displays. The midfielder’s contract expires at the end of the season, but talks over a new deal are now underway and the Gunners are confident of securing the Frenchman to a long-term deal in the coming weeks. Wenger will give his midfield a shake-up ahead of next season and Coquelin will be part of a new-look Gunners engine room next season. Francis Coquelin (bottom right) marked David Silva out of the game in Arsenal's 2-0 win at Manchester City . At the end of last year Coquelin was on loan at Charlton, with his Arsenal career seemingly over . 2008-present: Arsenal (28 apps, 0 goals) 2010–2011: Lorient LOAN (24 apps 1 goal) 2013–2014: Freiburg LOAN (16 apps 0 goals) 2014: Charlton Athletic LOAN (5 apps 0 goals) The Gunners will make Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin their primary target in the summer, with Wenger identifying the France international as the man he wants to be his lynchpin next season. Alongside Schneiderlin and Coquelin in Wenger’s midfield options will be Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta. Abou Diaby is set to leave when his contract expires in the summer, while the fact that Coquelin has now overtaken Mathieu Flamini in the midfield pecking order has placed doubts over his future at the club. Coquelin is no stranger to the Arsenal shirt, here pictured in the 8-2 defeat by Manchester United in 2011 . Interceptions: 6 . Tackles: 3/3 . Aerial duels won: 7/8 . Clearances: 11 . Passing accuracy: 87 per cent . Coquelin’s new contract will complete a remarkable turnaround in his status at the club over the past few weeks. The former France Under-21 international was deemed surplus to requirements at the end of last season, but the Gunners failed to find a permanent buyer for the midfielder. He was loaned out to Charlton, where he made five appearances, before being recalled to the Emirates Stadium in December.

"Click here to read Martin Samuel's match report from the Etihad Stadium . On December 6, Francis Coquelin put in a battling performance for Charlton away at Nottingham Forest. His Arsenal career looked to be over. But in the space of just 43 days the young Frenchman is seemingly irreplaceable in the Gunners midfield after a masterclass in shielding his defence in the 2-0 victory at Manchester City. Such a display from the whole side has led to questions whether the penny has finally dropped with Arsene Wenger. And after years of trialling several players, he may have found a new midfield general. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger on the development of Francis Coquelin . Francis Coquelin marked David Silva out of the game as Arsenal beat Manchester City 2-0 on Sunday . Arsenal haven't had a midfield general in their side since Gilberto Silva (left) and Patrick Vieira (right) starred . At the end of last year Coquelin was on loan at Charlton, with his Arsenal career seemingly over . 2008-present: Arsenal (28 apps, 0 goals) 2010–2011: Lorient LOAN (24 apps 1 goal) 2013–2014: Freiburg LOAN (16 apps 0 goals) 2014: Charlton Athletic LOAN (5 apps 0 goals) Coquelin's commanding influence in midfield in shackling City playmaker David Silva was one Arsenal fans have longed for since the days of Gilberto Silva and Patrick Vieira. At just 23 years of age, his sense of leadership from the first whistle was evident on Sunday. The fact that Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny were rarely called upon in Manchester was testament to his performance. Coquelin won 100 per cent of his tackles, 7/8 of his aerial duels, made six interceptions, 11 clearances, and his passion and desire on the pitch went down a storm with the travelling supporters. While this was just his 13th Premier League start, Coquelin is no stranger to the Arsenal shirt although he has often deputised at full back, something which makes his renaissance all the more surprising. The worry with the former Lorient teen was never his ability to tackle or his tenacity, but his passing, positional sense and know-how. Coquelin is no stranger to the Arsenal shirt, here pictured in the 8-2 defeat by Manchester United in 2011 . Arsene Wenger watched his Arsenal side beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium . Interceptions: 6 . Tackles: 3/3 . Aerial duels won: 7/8 . Clearances: 11 . Passing accuracy: 87 per cent . However, he was cool in possession (with an 87 per cent passing accuracy), always had an eye on Silva and showed his maturity after Santi Cazorla opened the scoring in the first half. While his team-mates were celebrating by the corner flag, Coquelin can be seen instructing them to calm down, to keep their focus. It was only at the final whistle that he really started to celebrate, cupping his ear in front of the away fans to ramp up the noise. 'I took him from France at the age of 16,' Wenger said of his compatriot. 'Today he is 23. He has gone through some difficult periods but he's a learner from his experiences. I've always kept faith in him, because I told him three months ago that he needed to play somewhere. 'He accepted to go down to Charlton and had convincing performances. Now he's come back, I've played him and he's done very well.' Coquelin is pictured telling his team-mates to calm down while they celebrated Santi Cazorla's opener . Francis Coquelin controlled the midfield area against Manchester City - click here to view more stats using our fantastic match zone service . Of course, the whole team should take credit for the performance, as should Wenger. But have the performances of Coquelin been tactical genius or pure luck? If all men were fit on Sunday he surely wouldn't have started. Struggling to make an impact on a season-long loan at Freiburg last season, his Arsenal career looked to be over despite failing to move away in the summer. Another short-term deal followed in the Championship with Charlton, more as a means of getting minutes under his belt than with a view to stepping up again with the first team. But with Mathieu Flamini and Mikel Arteta struggling with form and fitness in north London, Wenger placed his faith in Coquelin. A battling performance at the City Ground last month turned out to be his last performance for the Addicks, he was booked in the 1-1 draw. Coquelin impressed in games against Hull and Stoke, but against the champions he stood up to the toughest test. Coquelin had a 100 per cent tackle success on Sunday, here competing against Stevan Jovetic . Thierry Henry had insisted that Arsenal sign Alex Song, but after the game praised Coquelin . His tale is similar to that of Alex Song, another man who impressed at Arsenal after a loan move at The Valley. New Sky Sports pundit and Arsenal legend Thierry Henry was one urging Wenger to bring back Song, now at West Ham, but even he couldn't help but be impressed by Coquelin. 'I think that he can do the job. Easily. You just have to be disciplined,' Henry said after the game. 'If you're a centre back and you have that protection, you have an easier game. 'He can do it. It's just up to them to show it every time now.' Arteta, Flamini, Song, as well as Denilson and Abou Diaby, have tried and failed to make the 'Claude Makelele' role their own, but none stood up to the champions like the man from Laval. Transfer targets have fallen by the wayside. It's now Coquelin's position to lose.

"World Cup winner Gennaro Gattuso has told Hamilton he is the perfect man to develop the next generation of Accies starlets. The former Rangers and AC Milan midfielder has applied for the New Douglas Park manager's job and is hoping that the wisdom garnered from a glittering career will work in his favour when the Accies directors make their decision. Applications for the vacancy created when Alex Neil left for Norwich City close on Wednesday and Sportsmail understands the Hamilton board are keen to have a new manager in place by the middle of next week. Caretaker Martin Canning will remain in charge for Wednesday's clash at Partick Thistle and Saturday's home fixture with Inverness. Former AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso has applied for the vacant managers's job at Hamilton . 'I know a lot about Hamilton,' said the Italian. 'They have a great academy there and have already produced so many good young players. 'With the experience I have gained during my playing career, I can teach them a lot. I like working with young players.' Another Scottish connection for Gattuso is that his wife, Monica, is Glaswegian but his reasons for wanting to return to the dear green place are, he insists, purely professional. 'I will not be coming to Scotland for a holiday,' he said. 'I will work as hard as I possibly can to be successful. 'I think my style is perfectly suited to the way the game is played in the UK. I like aggressive football and for players to put pressure on the ball. Gattuso was signed for Rangers by Walter Smith in 1997, but was moved on 15 months later . 'My agent has already spoken to the people from Hamilton and I have told him to put everything on hold until we have a response from them. 'There have been clubs from Hungary, Israel and other countries who have contacted us to offer me jobs but Hamilton is at the top of my list and I will not speak to anyone else for the next few weeks. 'I have family in Scotland but that is not the only reason I want to work there. The football is a good standard and there is a good atmosphere at the matches. 'Hamilton are also a nice club to go to. Their results this season have been impressive – especially beating Celtic at Parkhead – and they are in the top half of the table. 'Their previous manager has just been chosen by Norwich and he is younger than me so that proves it is a good job!' The tigerish midfielder is, of course, no stranger to the Scottish game. Signed for Rangers by Walter Smith in 1997, Dick Advocaat sold him to Salernitana for £4million just 15 months later, setting in motion a career which saw him lift the Champions League twice with AC Milan. Caretaker Martin Canning will remain in charge of Hamilton for Wednesday's clash at Partick Thistle . But Gattuso, who won the 2006 World Cup with Italy, hasn't enjoyed the best of luck in his initial attempts at management. He lasted just three months in his first two jobs, as player/coach of Swiss side Sion in 2012 and as manager of Serie B club Palermo the following year. He then spent six months with Greek Super League side OFI Crete before finally throwing in the towel just three weeks ago. Caretaker Canning, meanwhile, has still not officially applied for Neil's job but would welcome discussions with Les Gray and his board. Should he ultimately be overlooked by the Accies, however, Canning insists he would happily work under Italian World Cup winner Gattuso or whomever lands the post. At 33, he feels time is on his side to finish his career as a defender before one day eventually fulfilling his dream of taking charge of a team. 'If someone else comes in as manager I'll be fine going back as a player,' said Canning, who has his B-Licence and has coached the Hamilton Under-17s since 2012. 'I always knew that could be the case. I'd like to continue playing and there will be no hard feelings on my part if another man is in charge. Applications for the vacancy created when Alex Neil (above) left for Norwich City close on Wednesday . 'But management is something that interests me. I feel I have a decent knowledge in football and it's something I see myself doing, if not now then certainly in the future. 'I've not applied but the chairman and board will decide what way they want to go. And if they want to come and speak to me then that's great but until that happens I will continue to do what I'm doing and look to try and win games. 'The most important thing for me is the next game and right now that's Partick Thistle on Wednesday night.' Canning believes the success of Neil, who stepped up from captain to replace manager Billy Reid, shows that promoting from within can be the right move. And should he get the job, he jokes he has already planned his first major signing. 'My playing contract is up in the summer and I haven't spoken to the club about that yet,' he smiled. 'But I still think I've got something to offer on the pitch. I feel good physically and experience-wise I think I can be a help to the younger players round about me. So if I get the job maybe I can give myself a five-year deal! 'I'm best mates with Alex Neil and it shows how you can progress from player to manager and be a success. 'A few clubs have gone that way recently in terms of promoting players from within the squad and it's certainly been successful at Hamilton. 'But you just don't know what's going to happen. Until I do, I've got a lot more to think and worry about in terms of preparing the team than worrying about things I can't influence.'","Gennaro Gattuso has applied for the vacant Accies manager's job .

"Roberto Martinez admitted Leighton Baines is Everton's penalty king after Kevin Mirallas missed from the spot in Monday night's stalemate against West Brom. The Belgian took responsibility after Joleon Lescott was penalised for handling in the box, despite Baines being the Toffees' normal penalty taker. However, Mirallas, who was successful from 12 yards in the shoot-out in last week's FA Cup clash with West Ham, was left red-faced after his kick skimmed the post and went wide.

'Obviously missing the target makes it a big issue, if he hits the back of the net nothing would have happened, but both players have got enough quality, enough personality and enough character to convert the penalty at that moment.' He added: 'The big disappointment is that we couldn't convert the penalty, not who took it or why we missed it.'

The 20 year-old from Yorkshire, who came through three qualifying matches, went down 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 in an hour and ten minutes to powerful American Steve Johnson, failing to make up a ranking deficit of more than 150 places. With Heather Watson bowing out it was left to James Ward to try and join Andy Murray in the singles second round of the Australian Open as he took on Spain's Fernando Verdasco. Kyle Edmund put in a brave performance against America's Steve Johnson in the first round . Edmund arrived on court and had to wait for Johnson to arrive as he was running seven minutes late . Edmund will now head to Hong Kong to play in a Challenger level event next week . Playing on a remote outside court in the shadow of the giant MCG, Edmund did not disgrace himself against the much improved Californian, who in the past twelve months has cut his ranking from 157 to 38. The big-serving Johnson was sometimes troubled by Edmund's potent forehand but managed to break once each in the first two sets, with the qualifier unable to take his one break point created as the American tried to serve it out in the opener. Johnson was too strong for the young Brit as he progressed in straight sets . Edmund stayed with him admirably until halfway through the second, but the gap in experience and quality began to tell and there was no way back from the early break in the third. The British player, who has appeared at Wimbledon but only with the help of a wildcard, peppered the Johnson backhand but could never quite break it down. He went down with a second break of serve in the third set but is bound to have gleaned a lot from his Melbourne experience. He now heads for a Challenger level event in Hong Kong next week away from the bright lights of the Grand Slams. Edmund faces competing against a tough generation of contemporaries – as demonstrated by the likes of Thanasi Kokkinakis and Nick Kyrgios here – and admitted he needs to keep improving. 'To qualify here through three matches was a good experience, but I need to keep working on my return to get into the rallies. You learn more from your losses. The more matches you play at this level the more comfortable it becomes. 'I'm in a strong generation, there are quite a few coming through but I have to focus on what I'm doing and bring my game to the court. I haven't faced many players with that kind of serve I faced today.'","Steve Johnson beat Kyle Edmund in straight sets 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 .

"When a make-up artist is required backstage at men's fashion week, they're more often than not in for an easy job. But beauty buff Maria Comparetto had her work cut out for her when she was called on for the Sankuanz show at London Collections: Men today. The make-up maestro worked with Chinese designer Shangguan Zhe, whose show was supported by GQ China, to give the male models black eyes and even split lips. Chinese designer Sankuanz gave male models 'beautiful bruising' in a street fighter-inspired show . 'This is my second season working with Sankuanz and I love it because the show is always very playful and cartoon-like,' Maria told MailOnline. The beauty buff was asked to create a beautiful interpretation of bruises, essentially a 'playful edge on fight club'. 'We used obscure colours that you wouldn't usually see in bruising and made them more cartoon-like. It was bright, vibrant and fun but the guys were still pretty macho,' explained Maria. Maria deployed one of her artists to two male models and they spent around half an hour beautifying each man.

'The night before the show, I looked through the roster of models and decided which section of the face we would play up based on their features. 'So whether it was their forehead, lips, cheek or eyes, I told my team to take their time and make it look beautiful but hard at the same time,' she said. The make-up aimed to complement the playfully sinister collection, which was full of woollen trousers, pink tailoring and spray-painted shirts.

"Not charged: Torreano Batton, 18, is due back in adult court this afternoon for his arraignment after prosecutors asked for more time to make a decision . Five high school football players have been charged with the gang-rape of a 16-year-old girl after she was able to record part of her ordeal on her iPod. Of the five underage boys, all aged between 16 and 17 and on the football team at Winter Springs High School in Seminole County, Florida, two are now being prosecuted as adults and three will face court as juveniles. A sixth suspect, 18-year-old Torreano Batton, has not been charged but is due back in adult court this afternoon for his arraignment. The delay came after prosecutors asked for more time to make a decision, the Orlando Sentinel reports. The six suspects were arrested last November after a 16-year-old girl told police they sexually assaulted her in woods close to Winter Springs High School. She was allegedly raped by three of them as she walked from school to a nearby McDonald's through a small patch of woods on November 13. Batton and two others trapped her and refused to allow her to leave until she performed sex acts on each of them, prosecutors said. Then, as she was leaving McDonald's, the suspects are alleged to have dragged her back into the woods where four of them forced her to perform sex acts. Two suspects assaulted her twice, she said. The girl used her iPod to film part of what happened to her. The recording is said to show the suspects ordering her to perform sex acts and insisting she submit because it is one boy's 17th birthday. According to a police report seen by the Orlando Sentinel: 'The males are circling her and appear to be trying to intimidate her into performing the acts and keeping her from leaving.' The recording shows the victim answering 'No' and telling her attackers she wants to go back to school, the report says. Two of the underage suspects denied being involved, while the other three insisted the sex was consensual. Batton also denied involvement. Of the five underage boys, all aged between 16 and 17 and on the football team at Winter Springs High School in Seminole County, pictured, two are now being prosecuted as adults and three will face court as juveniles . If convicted, the three suspects charged as juveniles could be placed in a juvenile prison until they are 19 years old. The two juveniles charged as adults face a maximum of four years in the adult prison system as 'youthful offenders'. Batton, if charged and found guilty as an adult, faces a potential maximum sentence of 30 years. Four of the underage suspects are from Sanford and the fifth is from Winter Springs, where Batton is also from. Batton was freed on a £35,000 bond after more than three weeks in jail, ordered to wear a GPS tag and to stay away from Winter Springs High School.","Two of the boys will be prosecuted as adults and three as juveniles .

"It's perhaps the only opportunity most of us will have to 'visit' two monuments to the great age of exploration - in considerably more comfort than their first inhabitants. Google's Street View has created 3D explorable panoramas of the huts used by two fo the greatest Antarctic explorers - Ernest Shackleton and Robert Falcon Scott. The huts have been preserved by the intense cold - and offer an insight into the grim conditions faced by Scott and Shackleton a century ago. The panoramas were created by a lightweight tripod camera with a fisheye lens. In the winter of 1913, a British newspaper ran an advertisement to promote the latest imperial expedition to Antarctica, apparently placed by polar explorer by Ernest Shackleton . The interior of the hut has remained as it was when the explorers set sights on the South Pole . Google . said its new Street View Trekker backpacks, which took more than a year . to develop, were ‘another step forward’ in its plans to produce an . interactive and comprehensive map of the world. The . 40lb backpack holds up a number of 15-megapixel cameras, an on-board . hard drive, and enough battery to run for an entire day. Cameras are positioned to give a 360 degree view so every possible angle is captured. At the launch earlier this month, the US company said: ‘There’s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by foot. 'Trekker . solves that problem by enabling us to photograph beautiful places such . as the Grand Canyon so anyone can explore them.’ In the winter of 1913, a British newspaper ran an advertisement to promote the latest imperial expedition to Antarctica, apparently placed by polar explorer by Ernest Shackleton. It read, 'Men wanted for hazardous journey. Low wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in event of success.' Google's Street View blog has launched a 360-degree 3D version of the huts. The company first created Street View imagery of Antarctica in 2010. 'Today we’re bringing you additional panoramic imagery of historic Antarctic locations that you can view from the comfort of your homes. We’ll be posting this special collection to our World Wonders site, where you can learn more about the history of South Pole exploration,' says Laurian Clemence of Google. 'With the help of the Polar Geospatial Center at the University of Minnesota and the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust, we’ve now expanded our 360-degree imagery of the continent and are making views of many other important spots, such as the South Pole Telescope, Shackleton's hut, Scott’s hut and the Cape Royds Adélie Penguin Rookery, available to people around the world.' This new imagery was collected with a lightweight tripod camera with a fisheye lens—equipment typically used to capture business interiors through the Business Photos program. We worked with this technology because of its portability, reliability and ease-of-use (our Street View trikes wouldn’t be much use in the snow). For all its planes and vans mapping out the world, there have been places even Google cannot reach. Now . thanks to its latest weapon, the internet giant will be able to chart . everywhere from the depths of the jungle to the narrowest city alley.

"George Michael performing on November 17 in Munich, Germany, shortly before he fell seriously ill . A  £100,000 futuristic hospital bed is helping critically-ill George Michael fight severe pneumonia. He was rushed to the AKH hospital in Vienna a week ago after falling ill during his European tour. On Saturday, Professor Dr Christoph Zielinski and Professor Dr Thomas Staudinger, who are looking after the singer around the clock, said: ‘George Michael has severe community acquired pneumonia and is being . treated as an in-patient. ‘His condition has stabilised and he is responding to treatment.' However, yesterday morning The Sun claimed Mr Michael . had developed acute respiratory distress - a dangerous new complication that stops oxygen getting . into the blood and can often prove fatal. The . Wham! star is now being treated on a Triadyne Proventa bed, which is . for people with pneumonia who are unable to move. His family are believed to be by his bedside. Dr Carol Cooper, told the paper: 'The bed has probably saved his life so far. But he is far from out of the woods yet.' The futuristic bed, which measures 7ft 6in by 3ft 5in, mimics the body’s . natural movements to improve blood and lymph flow. It is also equipped with sophisticated technology to reduce . pressure on the patient's lungs. The bed holds them securely in place using moulded foam, while special Gore medical fabric creates a barrier against bacteria. George Michael is being treated with the TriaDyne Proventa Therapy System . It rotates the patient from side to side at 40 degrees or more to increase oxygenation of the blood and stop fluid building up in the lungs. It has an integrated scale to measure the patient's weight as well as an airflow system that helps maintain skin temperature control and manage moisture levels. The Triadyne can also transform into a chair or rotate fully upright to . enable medical staff to take chest X-rays. A doctor told Austrian daily Osterreich: 'He is still in intensive care and his condition remains critical. The next 48 hours are going to be crucial in George Michael's recovery.' He added that it was very possible the singer could still be in hospital at Christmas. George Michael is believed to have fallen ill in his suite at Vienna’s exclusive Imperial Hotel on Monday. After a doctor was called, he was immediately taken to the city’s Rudolfinerhaus private hospital. Doctors later decided to transfer him . to Vienna’s AKH hospital, which has the advanced specialist facilities . to treat his illness. He is being treated in a special ward at the hospital used by Austrian politicians and VIPs when they are seriously ill. Wham! George Michael (left) with Andrew Ridgeley from his boyband heyday in the 1980s . A . statement from his publicist stressed that he has pneumonia . and said any other speculation regarding his illness was ‘unfounded and . untrue’. It added Michael . had been told by doctors it was unclear how long he would take to . recover and he could not continue with his Symphonica tour because he would need complete rest. Ear, Nose and Throat specialist Gerrit Wohlt who has treated many famous opera and pop stars said the illness could have a terrible effect on his voice. 'It depends how long he spends on the ventilator, but in the worst case scenario his illness could seriously affect his singing capacity. 'The pressure put on his throat by the ventilator is very close to his vocal cords and in the worst case scenario could affect them,' said Dr Wohlt. Dr Wohlt continued: 'He could end up with a hoarse voice either short term or long term. A comeback in the new year is unlikely. George Michael will need months of rest and recuperation.' All 14 remaining dates have been postponed, including three concerts at Earl’s Court as a finale before Christmas. The latest cancellations come after . Michael had to call off one of his concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in . London after being hit by a viral infection. That concert has now been . rescheduled for next May. Regular tweeter Michael has also been conspicuously absent from his Twitter page since November 17. He announced the 65-show tour of Europe in May – three years after he said he would quit live performance. At the time, the singer, who spent a . month in prison for drug-driving last year, told a press conference: ‘I . felt very re-energised after my recent troubles. ‘I felt it was really what I want to do as an artist.’",Doctors tells Austrian newspaper 'next 48 hours are crucial for George Michael'
"Jurors in the rape trial of two former Vanderbilt football players watched dorm surveillance video on Thursday showing their alleged victim being carried inside and dragged out of an elevator. Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey are accused of assaulting the 21-year-old unconscious woman in a dorm room in June 2013. Two other football players are also accused in the case. The surveillance footage, which was discovered when officials were looking into vandalism, prompted the rape investigation. Vanderbilt police Lieutenant Donnie Harville testified on Thursday that the video showed a male student walking naked out of a bathroom in the coed dorm. Defendant Brandon Vandenburg, left, and Cory Batey, right, listen with attorney Fletcher Long, center during their trial for sexually assaulting a fellow student on Thursday . Vandenburg and Batey are the only two suspects who did not strike a plea deal with with prosecutors and plead guilty. The other two defendants are slated to testify against them . Jurors saw a surveillance video that showed the victim being dragged out of an elevator before she was gang raped . It also appeared that no one called police to report concern for the woman, even though the video showed two female students nearby when she was carried inside Gillette House around 2.30 a.m. 'To your knowledge, did she contact anyone out of concern?' defense attorney Worrick Robinson said. 'To my knowledge, no,' Harville said. The footage did not show any bystanders around when the woman was dragged out of the elevator. Defense attorneys say the video portrays a culture of binge drinking and promiscuous sex that their clients were caught up in. The defense also appears to be trying to convince jurors that no one would have been concerned for the woman because it was commonplace to see students drunk. Prosecutors accuse the players of laughing, taking photos and videos while the incapacitated woman was being violated in a dorm room. One is accused of inserting something in her while another egged him on. Another player is said to have had sex with her and urinating on her. On trial: Pictured in court on Wednesday, Brandon Vandenburg, left, and Cory Batey, right, are accused of raping a 21-year-old unconscious woman in a dorm room at Vanderbilt in June 2013 . Lieutenant Donnie Harville of the Vanderbilt Police Department testified about the surveillance footage and said that Vandenburg placed a towel over a campus surveillance camera on the morning of the incident . On Wednesday, Harville also testified that Vandenburg placed a towel over a campus surveillance camera on the morning of the incident. The footage shows the woman lying on the floor of a dorm hallway and being photographed in a compromising position, prosecutors said. Defense attorneys have said Vandenburg and Batey were drunk despite not being old enough to drink. Vandenburg, a star player who had recently transferred to Vanderbilt from College of the Desert in California, took the student to a bar called Tin Roof for a date on the night of the alleged attack. On the ride back, she reportedly passed out in the car and he drove to the dorm, where he ran into the other players. During the opening statements, the alleged victim, an Oklahoma native, sat in the audience wiping her eyes with a tissue. She is expected to take the stand as a witness for the prosecution. Star witnesses: Fellow football players Brandon Banks (left) and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie (right) also have been charged in the rape case but are expected to testify against Vandenburg and Batey . Accused: Vandenburg (left) had been on a date with the woman the night she says she was attacked. On the way back, she passed out and Vandenburg took her to the dorm where he saw Batey (right) and the others . Crime scene: Prosecutors say Vandenburg brought his unconscious date to his second-floor room in the Gillette House dormitory, where the men egged each other on and proceeded to rape the young woman . Vandenburg and Batey are being tried on five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg is also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography. The two ex-players not on trial but also charged in the case, Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie and Brandon Banks, are expected to testify against Vandenburg and Batey. All have pleaded not guilty. The trial comes in the midst of a debate about the prevalence of rapes on America's college campuses. The Obama administration has launched a campaign to end sexual assault on university campuses. Officials at Vanderbilt University did not immediately respond to a call seeking comment.","Brandon Vandenburg and Cory Batey 'assaulted the unconscious 21-year-old student with two more football players as they egged each other on'

"Rafael Nadal is referencing the past and the future with his equipment at this year’s Australian Open — and so far it does not seem to be doing him any harm. The 28-year-old Spaniard is looking ahead with his racket, which includes a microchip transmitter in the handle that records which type of shots he is hitting and at what velocity. His increasingly tight shorts, meanwhile, are more of a throwback to the 1970s. Most importantly he is now off the mark for the season, winning his first round with surprising ease against Russian Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. The microchip racket technology is legal from the start of this year. Rafael Nadal celebrates after beating Mikhail Youzhny in the first round of the Australian Open . Nadal beat the Russian in straight sets to ease into the second round in Melbourne . ‘It is a help to see how many forehands and backhands you hit,’ said Nadal. ‘I know to play well I have to hit 70 per cent forehands and 30 per cent backhands.’ As for the shorts, he says: ‘We made them a bit shorter last year and this year a little bit more. I feel more comfortable this way, more fresh.’ Back problems and then appendicitis wrecked the second half of last year for Nadal, and he did not look good in this season’s early run-outs. Nadal is using a new microchipped racket called 'Smart Racket' to record what type of shots he plays . Nadal said that he has not felt any pain in his back this season after being plagued by injury last season . But he is a different creature in the Grand Slams, where his form tends to build towards a crescendo. And, after beating the tough Youzhny, he finds himself in by far the easiest part of the men’s draw, with American journeyman Tim Smyczek up next. He should now be able to gain desperately needed matches in the first week and then ratchet up his level in the second. ‘For the moment this year the back is not limiting me,’ said Nadal. ‘You always have doubts before the first match, so winning today gives me some confidence.’ Former finalist and No 5 seed Ana Ivanovic was upset 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 by Czech qualifier Lucie Hradecka.","Rafael Nadal beat Mikhail Youzhny in straight sets in Australian Open .

"Andy Murray got an early season reminder that even players ranked below 300 can be a handful, and that playing Grand Slams is different to playing unofficial exhibition events. Faced with the pressure of the year's first Major and an underrated opponent in Yuki Bhambri, the world No 6 had life made awkward for him by the unfacied Indian before coming through 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 in two hours and 13 minutes at the Australian Open. The 27 year-old Scot now faces Australia's Marinko Matosevic, who won his first match in five attempts at Melbourne Park by overcoming Russian Alexander Kurdyatsev in five sets. Murray, who had swept all before him at non-ranking events in Abu Dhabi and Perth prior to this, struggled to contain his frustration against Bhambri, who had nothing to lose after coming through the qualifying event.

Murray celebrates his win by throwing his sweatband into the crowd . Yuki Bhambri looks dejected as he goes down in straight sets to Murray . Murray was played on the newly redeveloped Margaret Court Arena on day one . The Indian was the lowest ranked player in the draw at 317 but his probing groundstrokes often had Murray frantically retrieving, not to mention chuntering away at himself, shaking his head and cursing. At times it looked as if he had been expecting an easier ride. However, he made clear that was not the case afterwards, saying, 'He made it very difficult for me, he played very aggressively and made it tough. I had never seen him play before or hit with him and that made it more tricky. He shouldn't be ranked where he is. Murray was made to work for his win and was pushed all the way in the third set . Murray looked comfortable on his serve and did well to win in straight sets . 'I have got a tough draw this year and it's going to be quite a challenge.' The invective directed at Amelie Mauresmo and his player box does not bode well, although he looked fairly sharp a lot of the time, despite having to fight back from being a break down in the third set. He won the subsequent tiebreak 7-3 and overall served and returned with purpose against someone who showed the strength in depth of the men's game. Bhambri played far better than his world ranking of 317 suggested . On the plus side, and if one is looking at what he and Mauresmo have been working on during the off season, there seems to be a more deliberate ball toss on his serve and he moved particularly well wide to his forehand side. Murray was given the small honour of playing the first match ever on the revamped Margaret Court Arena, which now seats 7,500 and has been added to by what is proudly termed as the fastest closing roof in Australia. Murray's coach Amelie Mauresmo looked relaxed as the British No 1 progressed to the second round . Murray's fiance Kim Sears was there to watch her man from the courtside box .

"A homeless woman has come forward to add more confusion to the Robert Allenby saga, claiming she discovered the Australian golfer just one block away from the bar he says he was abducted from in Hawaii - not 10km away as he said immediately after the ordeal. Allenby said he was thrown in the boot of a car and woke up in a park on Sunday morning some 10km away from the Amuse Wine Bar in Honolulu where he had been drinking with friends before he was attacked. But the unnamed woman, who has spoken with police, told Channel Nine News that she stumbled across a 'bloodied and confused' Allenby in a park just a block away  where he was arguing with two homeless men. She alleged Allenby asked her to use his one remaining credit card to withdraw $500 so he could pay the two men to give him back his wallet. Scroll down for video . Allenby says he caem to about 10km from the Amuse Wine Bar in Waikiki on Friday night . An unnamed homeless woman claims she saw Robert Allenby 'bloodied and confused' just a block away from the wine bar . The woman told Nine News the men started to become 'quite aggressive' before a man, described as a former soldier, intervened and helped Allenby into a cab back to his hotel. It comes as Honolulu police reviewed CCTV footage from the wine bar showing Allenby leaving with two men and a woman before he was attacked. Police also have footage of a suspect using Allenby's credit card in Waikiki to purchase two bottles of alcohol, according to Channel Nine. Allenby had been having dinner and drinks with friends, including his caddie Mick Middlemo, who says there's 'no doubt' the golfer's drink had been spiked, the Daily Telegraph reports. Middlemo said he left the bar at 10.30pm and Allenby wasn't 'hammered'. The golfer paid a drink bill at 10.48pm and then went to the toilet. 'Later (on CCTV) you can see him come out of the bathroom looking like he's had 400 drinks. He didn't get that drunk in 20 minutes,' Middlemo said. The pair had been dining with friend Anthony Puntoriero and another person. Punteriero called Middlemo after noticing the golfer was missing about 11pm - the pair thought he had just gone back to the hotel room. CCTV footage showed Allenby leaving with two men and a woman before he says he was bashed and knocked unconscious. Allenby only remembers paying the bill and coming out of the bathroom where he was notified Puntoriero had already gone downstairs. He said he had no recollection of his time spent in the boot as he had been knocked unconscious. Australian golfer Robert Allenby was kidnapped from a bar, robbed and beaten up in Hawaii .

The thriller flick features Liam Neeson playing a former spy who is trying to track down his biological daughter, who has been sold into sex slavery. In an interview with the Seven Network on Monday morning, a battered and bruised Robert Allenby said the FBI are investigating the alleged incident. But the FBI denies that. 'The FBI is not investigating this matter whatsoever,' FBI Special Agent Tom Simon told Daily Mail Australia on Monday morning. 'A little bit of an American civics lesson - the FBI could only investigate a kidnapping if the victim was transferred interstate.' But Mr Simon said he did not believe Allenby was lying about FBI involvement. 'I don't believe the golfer was lying. Here's what the confusion arose from. 'The head of security for the PGA in Hawaii who I believe spoke to the alleged victim is a retired FBI special agent. 'So I believe it was from that conversation that the golfer came to the erroneous but not illogical conclusion the FBI was looking into this field. Allenby, 43, was in the country playing the Sony Open but missed the cut on Friday . In his son's corner: Robert Allenby appeared on Sunrise supported by his father, Don, who is pictured left . The golfer was drinking at Amuse Wine Bar about five miles from his hotel when he was kidnapped . The four-time PGA Tour winner paid special tribute to the homeless woman who helped him as he was starting to be harassed by other homeless people after being dumped out of the car. Born: 12 July, 1971 . Turned pro: 1992 . Joined PGA Tour: 1999 . Best major results: Equal seventh, U.S. Open (2004), The Open Championship (2008) Best Australian PGA result:2005 'triple crown', winning the Australian Masters, Open and PGA . Earnings: Allenby is 27th on the all-time list for the PGA Tour with $27,329,892 . The homeless woman got the bruised and beaten golfer away from the others, before a retired military officer also came to his aid. 'I was very fortunate, a homeless lady pretty much saved my life,' Allenby said. Scans have cleared Allenby of any serious facial or head injuries and he is hopeful of being cleared to fly in the next day or two. He doesn't yet know when he'll next hit the golf course. 'The chances of me playing next week are very slim, but I'm just taking it one day at a time.' 'Medically, I thankfully didn't suffer anything major beyond some bumps and bruises that will take a bit of time to heal,' Allenby said in a statement released by the PGA Tour on Sunday.

The Sony Open was held at the Waialae Country Club and Allenby was staying at the nearby Kahala Hotel . The Australian failed to make the cut after the first two days of play and was relaxing on Friday night . 'My plan currently is to fly back to the mainland and at that point, evaluate my ability to play next week at the Humana Challenge. 'Whatever the outcome regarding my ability to play next week, I anticipate a successful rest of the 2014-15 PGA Tour season.' Allenby has noticeable damage and lacerations to his nose and forehead. He has told reporters the FBI and local police have some leads. Middlemo had been with Allenby earlier in the night . 'We have some names and numbers and they have some leads to follow up, so I am confident they will get the guys,' Allenby said. 'With the FBI guys involved, they're the best, the guys on the tour are awesome, and they'll get to the bottom of it.' Allenby was most concerned about potentially not being able to call 13-year-old daughter Lily for her birthday, but scans have cleared him of any serious facial or head injuries and he is hopeful of being cleared to fly in the next day or two. 'She's really upset about it but at the end of the day it could have been a lot worse,' the Victorian said. 'I don't care about the money or my cards or anything like that. I am just glad I have survived this one.' After the incident, the Australian golfer was then returned to the Kahala Hotel where he had spent the week while playing at the Sony Open held at the nearby Waialae Country Club - where Allenby failed to make the cut after the first two days of play. His friend Anthony Puntoriero - who was with Allenby earlier on the night - confirmed he was kidnapped. 'He's all right now but we are still talking to detectives,' Puntoriero told AAP. Allenby was set to head back to the US on Saturday morning, but has stayed on to assist police with their investigations. The 43-year-old had been drinking with caddy Mick Middlemo and friend Anthony Punteriero . Allenby was set to head back to the US on Saturday morning, but has stayed on to assist police . The 43-year-old has been a professional golfer since 1992, and while a consistent performer on the PGA Tour for 15 years he has never won a major tournament. Allenby's best result at a major was to finish equal seventh - which he achieved twice - at the 2004 U.S. Open and the 2008 Open Championship. He won Australia's 'triple crown' in 2005 - winning the Masters, Australian PGA and Australian Open. He's also been a regular in the Presidents Cup, representing the International team five times between 1993 and 2009. The Melbourne-born golfer now lives in the U.S. full time, in Jupiter, Florida.","Robert Allenby was drinking in a wine bar in Waikiki, Hawaii, on Friday .

"Australia’s rising tennis star Thanasi Kokkinaki has sealed an astonishing upset win against world’s No.13 Latvian Ernests Gulbis after saving four match points. Powering through the first round of the Australian Open, the new kid on the block lit up the night with an incredible five-set victory 5-7, 6-0, 1-6, 7-6, 8-6 on Monday. It was a thriller performance for the 18-year-old from Adelaide, who is ranked 147th in the world, as he stunned the crowd and served his way out of an early exit of the tennis tournament. The potential grand slam superstar did a quick head-stand before running a lap of the court as he high-fives his supporters in the crowd after closing the match. Scroll down for video .

The potential grand slam superstar ran a lap of the court after his win as he high-fives his supporters . ‘I was thrilled with that win. Best win of my career. I’m really happy with how I played,’ Kokkinaki said after his staggering win against 11th seed Guilbis. ‘I started off well, got to 3-0, then dug a hole for myself. ‘I lost my form a lot. I played a really good second set and got on top of it and the match went up and down from there. ‘The crowd was unbelievable the whole night. Great atmosphere.’ Counting down to the dramatic final set, Kokkinaki refused to back down as he pushed the French Open semi-finalist to a decider after coming from behind. ‘I knew what I needed to do to play five-set tennis. Last year I wasn’t quite fit enough but this year, I feel physically very [sic] good so I’m happy with how my body is holding up,’ he said.

'I know that it was a good win but there's more to come. I don't want to just win one round. Obviously it was my best win yet and I'll enjoy it for the rest of the night. 'But then tomorrow I've got to get preparing for my next match - two days away.' The teen's epic win has earned him a match against Australian Sam Groth in the second round.

"A smuggler  tried to sneak 94 iPhones into China by strapping and concealing them around his torso - but was foiled when customs officers noticed his 'weird walking posture'. Embarrassing pictures show the man standing with his trousers down as officers reveal the startling number of mobiles attached to his body. He was seized at Futian Port, an immigration port of entry on the border between mainland China and Hong Kong. Foiled: A smuggler was caught trying to sneak 94 iPhones into China by strapping and concealing them around his torso . Customs officers grew suspicious after seeing a male passenger with 'weird walking posture, joint stiffness and muscle tension', reports the Huffington Post. Smuggling under Hong Kong law, where this man was said to be caught, can warrant a seven-year prison sentence and a fine as high as  $2m (£171,000). According to the report, so-called 'mobile armor' is a fairly common tactic for phone smugglers. All of Apple's iPhones are actually made in China under contract before being shipped to countries around the world -but purchasing one in the country can be a challenge. Not long ago, the only way to do so was through the black market. Recently, deals can be agreed to with legitimate providers such as China Mobile but supplies of the latest models are usually limited. Cluee: He was foiled when suspicious customs officers noticed his 'weird walking posture' And contracts and handsets are expensive compared to the devices made by Chinese manufacturers. According to the FT, an unlocked 16GB iPhone 6 is around £577. At around 18 per cent of the annual salary in China, it's a costly buy. As a result, buying new or second-hand handsets outside China and smuggling them into the country can be a lucrative business. Most of the devices in the pictures appear to be the iPhone 5S but there are also some iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models in view.

"Celtic boss Ronny Deila began preparing for next season by signing Dundee United's Gary Mackay-Steven on a pre-contract agreement. The Parkhead side confirmed on Friday that the 24-year-old Scotland winger will join the Scottish champions this summer. Mackay-Steven, who started his career with Ross County, made his first-team debut for United in July 2011, and has gone on to make almost 130 appearances for the Tayside club. Celtic boss Ronny Deila has signed Dundee United winger Gary Mackay-Steven on a pre-contract agreement . United, in a statement, claimed the player had rejected several attempts to extend his contract, 'including an offer that would have made him one of the highest earners at Tannadice'. 'He is a player we have been looking at for a long time,' said Deila as he prepared for the trip to Hamilton on Saturday, where defender Adam Matthews ruled out revenge as motive for Celtic's bid for victory. The Lanarkshire side grabbed the headlines in October when they beat Deila's men 1-0 at Parkhead with their first win over the Hoops in 76 years. Celtic went on an impressive run of nine league wins after that but still have not been able to shake off Accies, who can go level on points with the Parkhead side, albeit the Hoops have two games in hand following their return from the winter break in Gran Canaria. The 24-year-old scores against Hamilton during a Scottish Premiership match . Matthews, who missed the defeat to Hamilton, said: 'You don't like to lose to any team. But we're not looking for revenge. 'We go into this game the same we do every game looking to win and play as well as we can. 'Obviously we were disappointed to lose against them but since that defeat we went on a good run, I think nine games unbeaten. Maybe that was the wake-up call we needed. 'It's going to be a tough game but we know what we've got to do and we're fully focused on the job ahead. 'Obviously there's a bit more pressure playing catch-up but we know if we win our games in hand we go back top.'

Accies also have a plastic pitch but the Wales international was not for putting two and two together. He said: 'They are difficult pitches to play on because you don't see them every day. 'We played really well against Kilmarnock. Sometimes the pitch can be sticky so I think the rain helped. 'We've just go to see what it's like when we get there. Hopefully we can play the same as we did against Kilmarnock. if not, we've got to adapt quickly and find a way to win the game.'

Arsene Wenger is keen to sign the New Zealand central defender this month as he looks to bolster his options at the back.

Under the Advanced tab, look for the Security heading, and make sure that the SSL 3.0 check box is unchecked. If you're running a web server, check with your code provider in the case of open-source programs, for how to turn SSL 3.0 support off. Sergey Lozhkin, Security Expert at Kaspersky Lab has advised people to take the following steps to avoid possible incidents: . 1. Do not use public Wi-Fi hotspots if you’re sending valuable information such as online banking, accessing social networks via browser. This is always a risk, but the Poodle vulnerability makes it even more dangerous. 2. Disable SSL v3 and all previous versions of the protocol in your browser settings. SSL v3 is 15 years old now and has been superseded by the more up-to-date and widely supported TSL protocol, supported by most modern web browsers. The TSL protocol is not affected by the Poodle vulnerability. However, keep in mind that disabling SSL v3 could cause compatibility problems, so be careful before implementing this measure. Rumours of a bug in SSL software had been circulating in . recent days, prompting some security professionals to prepare . for a major new threat this week. Ivan Ristic, director of application security research with . Qualys, said 'Poodle' was not as serious as the previous threats . because the attack was 'quite complicated,' requiring hackers to . have privileged access to networks. Jeff Moss, a cyber adviser to the U.S. Department of . Homeland Security, added attackers would need to launch a . 'man-in-the-middle' attack. This would involve placing themselves between victims . and websites using approaches such as creating rogue WiFi . 'hotspots' in Internet cafes. Google suggested a technical workaround to secure web . servers, but added on its blog that it hopes to eventually . remove support for SSL 3.0 from all client software. Mozilla plans to disable SSL 3.0 by default in the next . version of its Firefox browser, to be released on November 25. SSL 3.0, in which the software is found, is currently used by Internet Explorer (IE) 6 (right).  'If Shellshock and Heartbleed (left) were Threat Level 10, thenPoodle is more like a 5 or a 6,' said Tal Klein, vice president with cloud security firm Adallom . 'SSL version 3.0 is no longer secure,' Mozilla said on its . blog. 'Browsers and websites need to turn off SSLv3 and use more . modern security protocols as soon as possible.' Microsoft Corp issued an advisory suggesting that . customers disable SSL 3.0 on Windows for servers and PCs. Representatives with Apple could not be . reached and an Oracle spokeswoman had no immediate . comment. Matthew Green, an assistant research professor of computer . science at Johns Hopkins University said that disabling SSL 3.0 . can be difficult for some computer users. 'It's not going to take out the infrastructure of the internet. But it's going to be a hassle to fix,' Professor Green said.","Poodle allows hackers to see data meant to be encrypted in plain text .
This could allow access to accounts for email, banks and other services .
Source of flaw is a widely-used, outdated encryption protocol, SSL 3.0 .
So far, no one has used the Poodle bug in SSL 3.0 to hack an account .

"This is what happens when a herd of elephants find a GoPro camera recording. Mike and Marian Myers left their video camera near to a watering hole where they had hoped to film two wild dogs they had spotted in Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe during a trip in September. While they were waiting for the dogs to show up, a group bull elephants unexpectedly approached the device and began playing with it. One of the elephants even put the camera in its mouth before spitting it out and giving it a few thumps with his foot on the floor. Describing the encounter, Marian wrote online: ‘Mike was on the edge of his nerves concerned for the safety of the camera. He was cursing the elephants from afar – he even gave an almighty whistle and shouted ‘leave the camera alone’ from the platform.’ Marian works as a film-maker, creating promotional videos for Wilderness Safaris. She lives in Johannesburg with her husband Mike, a pilot and wildlife photographer. Mike specialises in stills photography, while Marian uses GoPro cameras and writes regular blogs for the company’s website. Photographers Mike and Marian Myers left their GoPro video camera near to a watering hole where they had hoped to film two wild dogs they had spotted in Hwange National Park during a trip in September . Talking about their experience filming the elephants, Marian added: ‘We had seen two wild dogs at Hwange’s Madison Pan on an early morning drive and decided that we would venture back there with the GoPro to see if they appeared with the rest of the pack and the pups for an evening drink. ‘We set it up and arranged ourselves on the deck with the remote in hand. Now we had established the distance we could safely operate between the camera and the remote. 'On cue, elephants arrived and we started to film from our vantage point. While they were waiting for the dogs to show up, a group elephants approached the device . One of the elephants even put the camera in his mouth before spitting it out and giving it a few thumps . ‘Everything went very well until one large bull elephant came over and gingerly sniffed the camera and then gave it a prod with his foot. ‘That made the camera whip back and forth on the bendy stake like a Cape cobra ready to strike. ‘Things settled down again and we thought everything was back to normal. Until another young bull came over and investigated the camera. This time he kicked the stake hard enough to knock it over. ‘Then he sniffed it seriously and picked it up in his trunk and put it in his mouth! He quickly spat it out and gave it a few thumps with his foot and then moved on. Mike Myers managed to retrieve his GoPro camera when the elephants had turned their back on the device . Marian works as a film-maker, creating promotional videos for Wilderness Safaris. She lives in Johannesburg with her husband Mike, a pilot and wildlife photographer . ‘Round three came when a third elephant came past and looked at this weird contraption now lying apparently lifelessly on the ground, and he too gave it a cursory sniff and then with utter distain stomped on it. Several times. ‘Actually, the footage shows what the underside of an elephants foot looks like if he were to stand on you! After a few more stomps with his front foot, elephant number three lost interest and moved off. ‘Of course retrieving the camera is always a great challenge, but this time the split second there was a gap Mike hotfooted it down in the vehicle to the site. At first he couldn’t find the camera, but thankfully the white of the home-made conduit piping stuck out so he could identify it. ‘Back at camp we downloaded the footage, which we are delighted with! Elephants don’t think too much about foreign technology invading their watering hole – methinks!’","Mike and Marian Myers had set up a GoPro camera at Hwange National Park .

"It is a normal rite of passage for a baby to be toilet trained, but not many people extend that training to their dog. However, this Welsh Corgi, PingPong, certainly knows its manners and has been taught to use a human toilet all by herself. The dog's owner decided that using a toilet was a necessity for her pooch as the pair live in an apartment. PingPong, an adorable Welsh Corgi, has been trained to use the human toilet all by herself . Her owners have set up a small staircase to help her reach the toilet bowl . After she scales the stairs, the pooch can stand on - and pee over top of - the perforated platform . And it seems her skills are in demand. Since uploading a video of PingPong using a step ladder to reach the toilet and urinating into the toilet bowl, dog-owners have been inundating her with advice on how to train their pets to do the same. The adorable video shows the dog scurrying into the washroom and up the four steps needed to reach the bowl. And yes, she does slip and stumble a bit along the way. Perfect for apartment dogs, this loo trick is not just impressive - but makes for an effortless clean up . Where's my treat? PingPong looks eagerly at her owners after completing the task . Once PingPong gets to the top of the ladder, there is a makeshift perforated platform that she can stand and pee on. The platform is secured to the bowl with clips and makes for an effortless clean up as the pup's pee simply strains through. Posting the video online, the dog's owner writes: 'My puppy PingPong pees on the toilet ALL BY HERSELF! Successful potty training for living in an apartment.'","PingPong, a Welsh Corgi puppy, has been taught to use a human loo .

"While animal lovers can bond over complaints of a dog chewing their prized book or a cat mangling their favourite socks, few can boast about having their camera gnawed on by a grizzly bear. Environmental film-maker John Kitchin now stands in that rarefied group, after going through the bizarre experience in British Columbia, Canada, recently. Mr Kitchin has captured and shared the moment in a clip which starts off rather unassumingly. Scroll down for video . A grizzly bear is caught on camera wandering along a wooden bridge in British Columbia, Canada . Other bears are also seen wandering along the weathered structure in what begins as an unassuming clip . One bear begins to stare intently at the camera filming her actions, before she slowly makes an approach . In a remote forest setting, the bear is seen wandering along a wooden bridge over a salmon bearing river, where she peers down at her potential freshwater meal. Making the most of the weathered structure, the imposing creature scratches her nose - and even her bottom - against the edge of the bridge while enjoying what appears to be a lazy day. Mr Kitchin, who says he visited the picturesque region to shoot an interview with bear biologist Dr. Melanie Clapham, recalls: 'While were filming we had a visitor.' The 'visitor' is shown meandering along the bridge before looking over the edge to see the two humans sitting by the river as they chat. Apparently unfazed by what she sees, she continues to sniff around before catching sight of the hidden GoPro camera. Suddenly, the camera is flipped over before going into the bear's mouth - giving viewers a brief at her very large and sharp set of teeth. The bear curiously sniffs out her target as she inches nearer, pressing up snout up against the lens . Going in for the kill, the brown bear takes a large bite into the camera - and shows her large teeth . The bear appears to be unwittingly taking a selfie as she continues to toy with the device . After failing to find the taste appealing, the camera is spat out by the bear, who then proceeds to rub her snout all over the lens. She then gives the device another flip, showing the clawed paws of the bears surrounding her. Mr Kitchin, who eventually retrieved the device, says: 'The bear removed the camera from its case and put a canine, or four, through the body. The GoPro (mostly) still works when held together by duct tape.' While the unexpected moment created some fascinating footage, there's still more to come - provided somebody with nifty tech skills can help out. Explains Mr Kitchin in a caption on the video: '[The bear] had the camera for 2 mins and the last clip is corrupt. If anyone knows a rescue I'll be happy.' After ejecting the camera from her mouth, the bear gives viewers something new to glance at . The bear enjoys one last sniff of the now-damaged device as the brief clip draws to a close .","The brown bear discovers the device while meandering along a bridge in a remote part of British Columbia, Canada .

"The challenge was to boldly send a burger and chips where no fast food had gone before. And that's what two fast-food entrepreneurs managed to achieve. Andy Shovel and Pete Sharman, the proprietors of London-based burger outlet Chosen Bun, decided to attempt the outlandish challenge for a third time two weeks ago. Take-off: Peter Sharman loads the  burger and chips onto their flying device . First mission: The business partners claimed they were sending the first burger and chips into space . The business partners had made previous attempts to complete the stunt In June and August but their recording equipment broke and both trips were unsuccessful. The pair sent the burger and chips meal 112,000ft up and incredibly the video has now been viewed almost 89,000 times. Writing about their reason for sending a burger and chips into space the owners of Chosen Bun wrote in the video description: 'We sent a burger and chips to space. For no good reason.' Science: The two men have a background in physics and they spent £2,000 on the project . The Chosen Bun! Peter Sharman described the burger as being cold after it landed following the stunt . Mr Shovel and Mr Sharman needed a burger, chips, a balloon the size of a two-bedroom house, lots of helium, a GPS transponder, hand-warmers, a camera, a parachute, duck-tape and some string in order to send the fast food skywards. Speaking on the video Mr Shovel said the mission was reborn and they were eager to finally achieve their goal. The footage was captured on a GoPro camera and a loud bang is heard after two minutes and 50 seconds when the balloon expanded to eight metres in height. A message then appears on-screen which states that  the burger was found 32 miles from the launch site. One internet user on Reddit humorously labelled the burger and chips as Unidentified Frying Objects.","The owners of burger outlet Chosen Bun in London were behind the stunt .

"The ashes of items taken from the Dallas apartment where the man who died from the Ebola virus first became ill will be taken to a Louisiana hazardous waste landfill for burial. The linen, bedding and carpet taken from the apartment where Thomas Eric Duncan got sick were taken to the Veolia Environmental Services incinerator in Port Arthur, where they were destroyed Friday. Company spokesman Dan Duncan tells the Beaumont Enterprise that the ash will be analyzed for two days for any remaining contamination before it is sent to the Louisiana landfill. Steam from cooling towers rises above the rotary kiln at Veolia Environmental Services in Port Arthur, Texas. Items from the Dallas home where Thomas Duncan took ill were incinerated here at temperatures exceeding 1,500 degrees. Still, locals were concerned about the risks . State officials say Duncan's body was cremated but aren't giving further details. 'All 142 drums were unloaded with no incident and all were destroyed by noon (Friday),' Duncan said. Beaumont-Port Arthur officials say they're upset that Veolia didn't advise them that potentially contaminated material was being shipped into the area for destruction. A group of concerned area citizens met over the weekend to voice their fears, reports 12NewsNow. 'This can't happen,' Janice Rogers said.

"'Is he dead'? Not quite, but that's the reaction many shared when they watched Parkour runner Matt Quinlan plunge through the air before ploughing face-first into the side of a shipping container. Mr Quinlan, from New Zealand, was attempting the last leap of a routine Parkour run up and down several shipping containers before completely misjudging the final hurdle. After pacing through the circuit at speed, Quinlan had just one last leap to make but slipped in the process - smashing his face on the side of the steel container. Scroll down for video . Matt Gilmour lost his front tooth in the Parkour incident he was taking part in with a friend . The slip-up cost the Parkour runner dearly when he lifted his head to reveal a missing tooth and what would appear to be an expensive dental bill. A friend, who filmed the whole incident from behind, found the lost tooth on the ground when he went to help Mr Quinlan but let him know that it was likely he was in for more than just a headache. 'That's going to cost quite a few f****ing dollars to replace mate,' he said, staring down into his wide smile. 'Let's go, I'll drive you to the hospital.' Mr Quinlan required three stitches in the incident but was lucky not to do more serious damage when he fell limp to the ground after the failed jump.

Parkour participants run through urban areas jumping and tumbling between built objects . Mr Quinland hit his face and then fell limp to the ground below . He’d apparently done the jump twice before, but this time his shoes were wet and he lost grip when he when to push off from a standing start. The video was posted on a page dedicated to the 'World's Best Parkour and Freerunning Videos' but it's not because of Mr Quinlan's style or grace that his clip appeared on there. Those dedicated to the sport of Parkour took to YouTube to school the amateur in how to perform the stunt correctly, criticising his technique on the last jump. YouTuber Clay Eickemeyer said it was Parkour suicide to jump from a standing start. 'Looks like when he went up to do the jump, his feet were right behind the shallow trim on the sides, so when he jumped, his feet caught on it and his body flew in front, ' YouTuber Clay Eickemeyer said. 'Moral of the story: standing jumps kill people, do running jumps always.' Responding to his online pasting,  Mr Gilmour said injuries are part of the sport and that he wasn't a 'Parkour wannabe'.

"With Halloween just a few weeks away, thoughts are turning to costume ideas. If you're bored of dressing as a cat and tired of transforming yourself into a red devil, Millie Mackintosh has provided some garish inspiration. The former Made In Chelsea star, who usually oozes glamour, is almost unrecognisable as she transforms herself into a terrifying zombie for a photoshoot - and she's shared the tricks behind achieving the look with FEMAIL. Scroll down for video . Halloween inspiration? Former Made In Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh was transformed into one of the undead to help celebrate the imminent season five launch of The Walking Dead and now she's shared her tips for getting the look at home . 'I usually enjoy looking glamorous so it was really fun to get into character as a zombie walker The Walking Dead TV show,' said Millie. 'People wouldn't expect me to get made up to look ugly so it was really fun to do.' The fashion designer has traded her usual glamorous look for blood and gore after uniting with NOW TV for the startling makeover, which saw her transformed into one of the undead, in anticipation of the new series. With her face slathered in ghostly white foundation and smeared with fake blood, Millie, 25, a self-confessed fan of the hit show, posed for a series of fun shots. The painstaking steps involved in transforming the reality TV star took professional make-up artists more than three hours to complete - and the results were undeniably impressive. Startling: The process involved in transforming Millie took professional make-up artists more than three hours to achieve . 'This look is terrifying,' said Millie. 'I am a full-on zombie complete with wounds, hollow eyes and greasy hair.' Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millie won't be sporting this look herself come October 31st. 'Last year Stephen and I went to Jonathan Ross' party as vampires but me and my girlfriends are going as the Spice Girls this year. 'I think I'll go as a zombified Ginger Spice because I'm strawberry blonde; I've already bought my Union Jack dress from eBay,' she said. Recalling her most disastrous Halloween outfit, she said: 'One year I went as a zombie bride and everyone was wearing skimpy outfits. It was sort of a Lindsay Lohan in Mean Girls vibe. I just think the standard revealing outfit with fishnet tights isn't such a good look.' Impressive: Millie, 25, a self confessed fan of The Walking Dead, traded her usually glamorous look for blood and gore . Millie, who is married to London born grime star Professor Green, revealed that the rapper got her into boxsets - especially scary ones. Just one year into married life, Professor Green has joked that TV box sets have already become the 'downfall' in he and Millie Mackintosh's 'sex life'. The 30-year-old rapper, real name Stephen Maderson, revealed he and the former Made In Chelsea star enjoy nothing more than staying in for a quiet night in front of the box. Speaking in an interview with heat magazine, the Lullaby rapper joked: 'Most of our relationship is driven by humour. All we do is take the p**s out of each other until one of us cries. 'That's been the downfall of our sex life, I think - box sets. We've done House Of Cards, Breaking Bad, 24, American Horror Story. We're doing Ray Donovan at the moment - it's f**king wicked.' Finished article: Millie, a recent contestant on Celebrity MasterChef,  poses for before and after shots .

Fright fan: Millie says her husband Stephen has got her into scary box sets and the couple love staying in and watching TV . Big fan: In a promotional video filmed during the shoot Millie admits she loves the show, which launched on American channel AMC in 2010 . Special effects make-up artist Nicholas Thompson helped Millie, a former make-up artist herself, transform into a gruesome walker from the show for NOW TV. 'These simple tricks and techniques will help you achieve the look at home, with just a little practice and patience,' said Nicholas. 'Everything used within the tips can be found in a make-up bag or made with things that you can find at a supermarket or online.' What you'll need . - Skin cleanser . - Hair pin or band . - Sculpt gel (a mix of silicon and a curing agent) or porridge oats and petroleum jelly . - Wound filler or seedless raspberry jam and cooking glycerine . - Hairdryer . - Cuticle stick . - Grease paint palette (red, yellow, brown, purple colours) - Sponge, paint brush, wet wipes, fixing agent or talcum powder . - Fake blood . - Hairspray a comb and hair conditioner . Here we go: She applies ghostly foundation as the transformation gets under way . How to do it . Top tip: Ensure you aren’t allergic to any new products you might use by performing a patch test on . the wrist 24 hours before you begin . Step 1: Preparation . Massage some cleanser into the face to create a base. This will allow the skin to be moist and eases the removal at the end of the process . Pin back hair to see the full face and to stop stray hairs getting into the make-up . Step 2: Create cuts and scars . Use sculpt gel to create cuts and scars across the face . Apply the gel to the face, using a cuticle stick to move the gel around and create shapes – get creative and think about how your walker wound got there! Don’t be too even. Nature doesn’t work in straight lines and symmetry is seen as traditionally beautiful so we want to avoid this! Top tip: Sculpt gel can be bought online or within specialist make up shops. Porridge oats mixed with petroleum jelly make a great back up if you can’t find it . Greg’s tip: Think about what happened to the Walker for them to look like this and begin to tell a story through the make-up . Step 3: Dry the wounds . When you know where you want the wound, use a hair dryer on a low heat setting and work quickly to shape the cut using a cuticle stick . Getting ready: Massage some cleanser into the face to create a base. This will allow the skin to be moist and eases the removal at the end of the process . Step 4: Add dark shadows to the recesses of the face . Using a grease paint palette of just a few basic darker colours - you can get these from fancy dress shops or specialist make up stores - and a sponge or paint brush to apply . Add dark shadows under the eyes, temples and the nose. You want to really exaggerate where the natural shadow is for this . Top tip: Think of a skeleton’s face when doing this and try and mimic that look! Step 5: Create a unifying base . Use a yellow grease paint and a sponge and blend it to create an even base tone . You can also highlight certain areas around the darker patches using complimentary colours to create a gaunt look . Top tip: Check out a colour wheel before you start to decide on which colours work best together . Step 6: Highlight wounds . Using light red colouring and a sponge, highlight the dried wound and make it standout . You can remove any excess with a wet wipe, but smudging and smears give a more authentic walker look – it shouldn’t look too perfect! Top tip: Less is more here! Final touches: Fill in the wounds with wound filler which you can get from specialist make up shops, dabbing it with a paint brush to build up in layers . Step 7: Exaggerate features . Go over the eyelids and lips with a purple or brown hue using a paintbrush to really exaggerate those features . You’re aiming here to give the areas a bruised look . Top tip: Stand further away from the mirror so you can see yourself overall rather than focussing on one area . Step 8: Fill the wounds . Fill in the wounds with wound filler which you can get from specialist make up shops, dabbing it with a paint brush to build up in layers . Highlight the highs and lows with a range of bruise tones, giving the wounds depth and a less uniform colour . You can go over the wounds with a fixing agent or talcum powder so the colour doesn’t run . Top tip: You can make your own wound filler by mixing seedless raspberry jam with cooking . glycerine . Step 9: Add blood . Paint fake blood on to the wounds to give it a more gory look . You can also flick the blood onto the face with a toothbrush for a more authentic splattered look . Greg’s tip: Think about how your Walker got their injury and use that to consider how you should apply the blood and where to. For example, a gunshot wound will look different to a cut . Step 10: Dress the hair . Apply a little conditioner and back comb the hair in sections . Spray with hairspray to achieve the messy look . Top tip: Finishing touches and accessories really make the look, so consider everything from your clothes to your hair in your overall presentation. Dying to see it from the start?

"There are those who love nothing more than the adrenaline rush of amusement park rides... and then there's this teenager. During a visit to Orlando's Magical Midway Thrill Park, the man passes out three times during a one-minute ride on the Sling Shot. In between fainting, the unnamed rider wakes up and screams in terror when he finds himself dangling 390 feet above the ground. Not for the faint-hearted! A teen passes out on the Sling Shot ride at Magical Midway Thrill Park in Orlando . The whole traumatising episode is captured on video on the ride's camera. At the start of the clip the boy, who is riding with his friend Jordan Van Schalkwyk, looks decidedly nervous as they prepare to be catapulted into the air at a g-force of 3-5Gs. The ride promises to enable you to experience total weightlessness as you are flung into the air at breakneck speed - a feeling this guy does not appear to enjoy. Scared of heights? The young man is visibly nervous at the start of the ride . For thrillseekers: The ride catapults riders 390 feet into the air with a g-force of 3.5g . As they are catapulted, he screams and squeezes his eyes shut, before suddenly losing consciousness. He is passed out for eight seconds before coming to and, seeing that he is suspended 390 feet in the air, screams in terror again before fainting for a second time. His amused friend can be seen laughing and nudging his buddy trying to stir him. 'Dude, wake up': The young man faints three times in the minute-long ride . The frightened teen wakes, briefly passes out for a third time, and eventually manages to remain conscious. Jordan, who posted the footage online, finds the experience hilarious, and comments that they have to buy the video so they can watch him passing out three times in a row. He tells the ride operators: 'Three times, he passed out! Three times!' Far from a unique reaction, there are a handful of other viral videos on YouTube which show riders passing out multiple times on the Sling Shot ride.","Unidentified rider passes out multiple times during one-minute ride .

The prestigious university - regularly . ranked among the world's best - was not immediately available for . comment on the incident, which happened on Friday night. But concerns have been raised over levels of binge drinking during freshers' week in the city, with police drafting in extra man power in time for the influx of new students. A video of the alleged incident shows the rapper turn to the crowd and say: 'Are we going to have a f***ing good time tonight, or what?'

"This shocking video shows the extreme lengths impatient drivers will go to to avoid getting stuck behind bin lorries. Motorists were filmed mounting the pavement, swerving round lamp posts and careering into people's gardens to get around the vehicle as rubbish collectors made their rounds. The video, filmed on the Isle of Wight, has been released by Island Waste Management in a bid to encourage drivers to be more patient on the roads. Scroll down for video . A driver drives into a front garden to get around bin collectors in the video which shames reckless driving .

A white van captured on the rubbish lorry's CCTV camera squeezes in between the vehicle and a shop to avoid waiting behind rubbish collectors . Rubbish collectors have to jump out of the path of an oncoming car as it mounts the pavement to get around the lorry . In one clip, a white van with a roof rack squeezes itself in between the lorry and a roadside shop, ploughing into its fabric canopy as it slowly pushes past. Dozens of other drivers mount the pavement on residential streets to get around the vehicle, forcing rubbish collectors to jump out of their path as they try to empty wheelie bins. One driver, somewhat unnecessarily, even careers into a front garden to scoot around the lorry. A montage of the footage - taken between 2012 and 2013 - was presented to Hampshire Police by the waste management company. Twenty of the drivers received a fixed penalty notice between £50 - £100 and three points of their licence. Around six others were taken to court for dangerous driving placing serious or imminent risk to life. All pleaded guilty once shown the video evidence and were given six points and a fine of approximately £600.

A large van with equipment strapped to the top squeezes past the lorry as an employee waits to collect more rubbish . Rob Brooker, Island Waste Services municipal manager said: 'Refuse collections are a vital part of everyday life on the Isle of Wight and the vast majority of drivers are courteous and drive safely past our vehicles and staff. 'However, there have been occasions where impatient drivers have not only risked their safety, but those of others and our staff. 'Whilst residents are aware that the refuse collection vehicles will hold up the traffic not all are willing to wait patiently for our staff to go about their work.' Sergeant David Sanderson from the Isle of Wight's Roads Policing Unit said: 'I am astonished by the impatience of many drivers and the blatant disregard to their own safety and that of Island Waste Services staff. 'The highest risk is drivers passing either side of the truck too fast and without due care and attention often being abusive and insulting. ‘Our Roads Policing Unit is committed to working with Island Waste Services to collect evidence and prosecute drivers. We have already issued a number of fixed penalty notices and several drivers are being taken to court.'","Drivers mounted pavement and swerved around lamp posts on Isle of Wight .

"New camera footage offers a first-hand view that few people have ever been able to record: what a black bear attack really looks like. Filmed on a game camera at Island Park in Idaho, the 30-second video shows the animal sniffing around the site, before lunging toward the lens. The black bear swipes his paw at the screen, shaking the camera violently, before scampering away. This quick video offers a first-hand account of what it's like to be attacked by a black bear . The black bears are native to the Island Park, Idaho region - however, they often only emerge at night . Idaho's Island Park is located only 15 minutes from the west side of the famed Yellowstone National Park. The Greater Yellowstone National Park Area is known for its high population of black bears. While the bears are most active at night, they can be spotted at any time of day - particularly during the early fall berry season. In order to get this type of footage, an outdoor camera, like a game camera, is required. They are tough, motion-activated cameras, designed precisely to capture these types of wildlife encounters. Using infrared night-vision technology, their extremely long battery life means that they can be left for weeks to really allow hunters to get a sense of the area. As in this instance, the camera can even be fastened to a tree or bush, minimising the risk that a predator will run off with it. In this blurry screen grab, the bear is swiping his right paw at the camera - shaking it violently . Using a motion-activated outdoor camera, such footage is possible to capture - without endangering humans .","Video from Island Park, Idaho, shows rare first-hand account of bear attack .

"They're some of man's closest relatives. But this little Capuchin monkey has taken aping human behaviour up a notch. When his keeper hands him some dental floss, he does what we all need to do more of - he gives his gnashers a thorough floss.

Google has vigorously denied claims of size discrimination by issuing a flat-out statement that it does not discriminate in its hiring process. But the unidentified woman, who had already passed a phone interview, thought there was discrimination during the test, reported the Jezebel blog.

Hot favourite Selby was dumped out of the tournament by home favourite Reece McFadden after receiving a points deduction for repeatedly losing his gumshield.

'I wasn't thinking straight and I was thinking I had had enough. But in the end I knew I just had to face reality. Every champion loses so hopefully I will do better in the future.' Selby will be part of the re-formed British Lionhearts squad which will compete in this season's World Series of Boxing - starting with a January 15 clash against China Dragons at York Hall in Bethnal Green. Selby was docked points for losing his gumshield and returned home without the medal he craved . Selby shows his dejection after defeat and admits he still hasn't fully recovered . Automatic qualification for Rio 2016 is at stake for the leading WSB fighters in each weight category and Selby is determined to make the most of his opportunity to end his amateur career on a high. Selby added: 'Whatever happens I will definitely be turning professional after Rio and there's no reason why I can't do so with a medal.

Scroll down for video . Prince Harry was caught up in a dramatic high speed crash yesterday when one of his police outriders smashed head on into a mini-cab . The drama unfolded as the royal’s motorcade headed to the Invictus Games, which has been spearheaded by Prince Harry, in north London . The police outrider, pictured, was catapulted 30ft down the road after the collision, which took place as the Prince was on his way to the Invictus Games . Pictures taken in the aftermath of the accident in central London show the police motorbike embedded in the white Toyota Prius, as the driver lies slumped in his seat surrounded by deployed airbags . According to one witness the prince’s Range Rover, which was taking him to an Invictus Games event in north London, took immediate evasive action. The driver, acting in line with his anti-terrorism training, expertly steered through the damaged vehicles at speed before coming to a stop several hundred feet along the road. The bystander said he saw Harry, 29, in the back of the car with his head in his hands, constantly looking backwards at the injured men with ‘concern etched on his face’. Last night the rider from the Special Escort Group was discharged from hospital, while the driver was said to be in a ‘stable’ condition. Last night the rider from the Special Escort Group, who rode the motorbike, was discharged from hospital, while the driver of the Toyota was said to be in a ‘stable’ condition . After the crash, Harry's driver - apparently fearing a potential terrorist attack - expertly steered through the damaged vehicles at speed before coming to a stop a several hundred feet up the road . A source close to Harry said the prince was insistent they stop and help, even though his security advice would have been to drive on . The Metropolitan Police also began an investigation into the accident, which occurred at around 9.40am on Prince Albert Road, adjacent to Regent’s Park and London Zoo. A cyclist, who wishes to remain anonymous, saw the convoy of two blacked-out Range Rovers and four motorbike outriders pass him at ‘incredibly high speed’. He said: ‘I decided to speed up to see if I could catch up with them. I really wanted to know who it was. CCTV footage obtained exclusively by the Mail appears to show the minicab driving down a side street, stopping at the junction . The car then pulls right across the main road – straight into the path of the police motorbike, which was on the wrong side of the road . The motorbike became wedged into the bonnet of the white car and police and ambulance were called to the scene . The witness said: ‘The first thing that struck me was the motorbike rider in his high visibility jacket lying prone on the ground. He had been put in the recovery position and had his helmet off' ‘I didn’t see the actual crash but came across it just seconds after it had happened. 'There was debris everywhere, steam coming out of the car bonnet. It was carnage.’ CCTV footage obtained exclusively by the Mail appears to show the minicab driving down a side street, stopping at the junction and then pulling right across the main road – straight into the path of the police motorbike, which was on the wrong side of the road. The bike had its police lights on but there were no sirens. The witness said: ‘The first thing that struck me was the motorbike rider in his high visibility jacket lying prone on the ground. He had been put in the recovery position and had his helmet off.

Firemen were forced to cut the roof off the Prius to pull its driver from the wreckage . One cyclist, who did not want to be named, said the aftermath of the crash was 'carnage' The smashed vehicles were still on the road several hours after the accident, with traffic diverted to avoid the scene . Safety of royals on the road is in the hands of Scotland Yard’s Special Escort Group. Its officers are a common sight in the capital, where teams of outriders are used to ease a smooth path through congested roads. Riding powerful Honda VFR 1200cc motorcycles, they use blue flashing lights and whistles – not sirens – to control the traffic. In many cases, the motorcycle team will be backed up by officers in a following command vehicle, often a Range Rover. All SEG officers are advanced drivers and motorcyclists, and are among the few police motorcyclists who openly carry firearms. Yesterday’s crash will spark an urgent internal review – not least to reduce the chances of a repeat. ‘He was definitely the focus of everyone’s attention. The motorbike was well and truly wedged in the bonnet of the Prius.’ Not wanting to get in the way of the emergency effort, the cyclist began to ride off when he noticed the second black Range Rover parked down the road. ‘I could see Prince Harry clearly in the back of the car with his head in his hands,’ he said. ‘He looked really distressed and was constantly looking back over his shoulder to see what was happening. It was clear that for security reasons he had to stay in the car.’ Royal aides confirmed last night that Prince Harry’s convoy had been involved in the crash but that he hadn’t been injured. A source close to Harry said: ‘It was clearly a shocking incident but he was pleased the officers were able to stop and administer important immediate first aid.’ A source on the scene said: ‘The police were fantastic and sped into action, assessing those who were injured and treating them until the ambulances arrived.’ Officers cleared up debris in the aftermath of the crash, which took place at about 9.40am .

"This three-year-old already knows the importance of budgeting. Adorable Nova is clearly anxious of over the loss of her money and is set to get to the bottom of the mystery of her missing dollars. The questioning - shown on a video uploaded to YouTube by her father - starts  with her dad asking her just how much her mother had spent shopping and what was it she bought. ‘How much did mummy spend?’ he asks. The child is certain of the amount, saying ‘$80,’ but only holds up four fingers. ‘I did not!’ a voice says from the background, just as the child reiterates her statement, claiming that her mother had used a credit card to spend the money. But she quickly corrects herself, telling her father: ‘She used your dollars.’ Her face is serious as she tries to convey the severity of the situation to her clearly amused father, who fights to contain his giggles. ‘What did she buy?’ the father questions. Adorable three-year-old Nova first blames her mother, and then her father, for taking her money . ‘She bought a “frozen” and a playdough,' the girl says in the four-minute clip, punching the air to stress her point. But unbeknownst to her, she’s walked right into a trap as her father’s next question has her confused. ‘Now why would she buy that?’ he asks. But Nova turns away and in a barely audible whisper says, ‘I wanted playdough’. Her father pursues the subject, ‘Did you have money? Did you buy the playdough? Then why did you ask for it if you don’t have the money?’ She wanted 'playdough': Nova's story changes and she stumbles at one point as she weaves her tangled tale . ‘I have money,’ she says, certain of her financial independence. And in a swift move, Nova turns the tables neatly and her father now finds himself at the end of a barrage of accusations. ‘You took my money,’ she says. He’s shocked at being dragged into the blame game and denies taking her cash but Nova is not interested in his side of the story. The three-year-old seems quite sure of the exact time and place the incident occurs and continues to eloquently explain just what happened and how much money was pilfered. ‘You take my money to your work, when you’re going to work, you take my money’, she says in her endearingly lilting tones. She is certain that her father spent ‘ $20 of my money’ and swiftly becomes the inquisitor, asking, ‘Why, why did you take my money?’ Nova is convinced that her father owes her 'twenty-eighty-nine dollars.' The eloquentlittle girl spends nearly four minutes trying to get to the bottom of the mystery of her missing dollars . ‘I want my money back,’ she beseeches. ‘Is it in your pocket? Did you leave it in the store?’ ‘I didn’t take your money,’ her father says, but to no avail as Nova is convinced he now has her cash. ‘How much does Daddy owe you?’ her mother asks. ’Twenty-eighty-nine dollars,’ Nova says, as both her parents try to stop themselves from laughing out loud. They quickly change the subject, asking the child what was purchased with the precious dollars. ‘I bought eat and then I went to the store and then I bought a whole bag of frozen,’ she rambles on. ‘Why would you buy a whole bag of frozen stuff,?’ her father asks. Disconcerted by this line of questioning, Nova is at a loss for words and stumbles on her sentences as she tries to clear her thoughts and explain to her father just what happened. She quickly gains her composure, saying, ‘You took my money, I didn’t take your money, you did’ and goes on to explain what was bought and how much was spent. ‘It’s not true, Nova’ her mother admonishes as the little girl’s story gets more and more tangled. ‘You guys spent $28 on toys?’ the father asks in mock disbelief as Nova’s mother is heard protesting in the background. ‘Mummy bought your medicine because you were sick and then we went to eat breakfast,’ the mother says, clarifying just what happened. ‘You’re something else!’ Nova says, pointing at her mother. ‘You’re taking all my money!’ ‘I am not something else, I am your mother!’ her mum says, just as the father is unable to control himself any longer and starts laughing.","Nova first blames her mother and then her father for pilfering her cash .

"Rafael Nadal put his recent woes behind him as he eased to victory in his first-round match at the Australian Open on Monday. Nadal's 2014 season had ended with defeat by 17-year-old Borna Coric in Basle and this year on tour began with a shock loss to world No 127 Michael Berrer in Doha. But the Spanish world No 3 was in fine form in his opener at the first Grand Slam of the year in Melbourne as he took just one hour and 50 minutes to beat Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. Rafael Nadal  salutes the crowd after winning his first round match against Mikhail Youzhny . Nadal celebrates his straight-sets victory over Youzhny in the first round . Nadal said: 'It was a very positive result for me. I think a very good start is very important. 'Always before the first match you always have the doubts, especially in the situation I'm arriving here. Every match is very important for me today. It was a comfortable victory that gives me some confidence.' Nadal has never lost a set in the first round here in Melbourne and never on Monday did that run look like ending on the Rod Laver Arena. Russian world No 49 Youzhny can be a wily opponent but the 32-year-old has struggled in recent times to match the level of consistency he once had when he was ranked as high as No 8 in the world. Nadal hit a total of 37 winners throughout the match and sealed the win with a volley before showing his clear delight in celebration, pumping his first after picking up his first official victory of the year. Nadal of Spain plays a backhand on his way to his first round victory over Youzhny . Russia's Youzhny had no answer as Nadal brushed him aside in straight sets . Nadal had cautiously downplayed his chances prior to the tournament but there is no doubt that he has the benefit of a kind draw from this point until a possible semi-final meeting with Roger Federer. However, the 14-time Grand Slam champion still feels he needs to shake off the rust after only playing nine tour matches since July due to a wrist injury and appendix surgery. Nadal said: 'You can practice a lot. I did. I practised I think enough and with the right attitude, but at the end what you need is matches. You practice very well, but you don't have matches under your shoulders. 'You cannot play with the right confidence, with the right competitive spirit, because you need to feel that. All the practices, you don't get that. The only way to get that is having matches. 'That's why this victory today is very important, and every time that I am on court competing is a big help for me to try to be back on the right level that I want to be.' Next up for Nadal in the second round is American world No 112 Tim Smyczek, who beat Luke Saville 7-6 (7-2), 7-5, 6-4.","Rafael Nadal made a winning start to his Australian Open campaign .

"Danny Cipriani faces Six Nations heartache on Monday, when England’s selectors meet for the final time before naming their squad for the last tournament before the World Cup. With eight Tests left before the global tournament kicks off, Stuart Lancaster and his coaching team of Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt will convene to pore over a weekend of high-class European action before announcing a 33- or possibly 34-man squad on Wednesday for the RBS Six Nations, which kicks off in Cardiff on February 6. The Mail on Sunday understands Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley will be in the squad after serving the fifth ban of his career but 27-year-old Cipriani looks almost certain to miss out despite a string of outstanding displays for Sale this season and a much-improved disciplinary record. Danny Cipriani faces missing out on the Six Nations when England selectors meet for final time on Monday . Stuart Lancaster and his coaching team of Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt will convene . ‘If he’s not picked this time, Danny won’t know what more he has to do,’ said a source close to the player. With a possible move to French giants Toulon touted, the decision to omit the Sale playmaker may prompt him to move across the Channel next season and effectively end his international career. Barring the probable return from injury of Ben Morgan (broken leg), Dan Cole (foot) and Manu Tuilagi — with the Leicester centre’s slower than expected recovery from a groin problem causing concern — the vast majority of players named on Wednesday can expect to be involved in the World Cup later this year. Conversely, those who miss out will need injuries or loss of form from their rivals to stand a realistic chance of featuring in the global tournament. Harlequins flanker Chris Robshaw will captain a squad which will also include Exeter’s Jack Nowell and fit-again Northampton prop Alex Corbisiero. With George Ford and Owen Farrell set to be named as the first-choice fly-halves, Lancaster must decide whether to opt for Northampton’s dependable Stephen Myler or the mercurial but potentially game-changing talent of Cipriani as the third-choice No 10. The England head coach has spoken twice in the past fortnight with Cipriani — who has not started a Test match since 2008 — to assure him he remains in his plans. But on Saturday night he appeared certain to be named in the Saxons squad to face the Irish Wolfhounds on January 30 alongside rugby-league convert Sam Burgess. The Mail on Sunday understands Cipriani could be invited to train with the senior squad but anything less than a full recall will leave a player many consider the most talented of his generation bitterly disappointed. ‘If he’s not picked this time, Danny won’t know what more he has to do,’ a source has told Sportsmail . The decision to omit Sale playmaker Cipriani may prompt him to move across the Channel next season . The England head coach has twice assured Cipriani that he remains in his plans in the past two weeks . ‘With Cipriani you either love him or your hate him,’ said England World Cup winner Kyran Bracken. ‘He’s mercurial and he’s different and he can do things on the hoof. ‘But the fact that Cipriani has had his chance over the years and probably hasn’t settled in the England shirt means I think Stuart Lancaster will go with someone like Myler, who is a bit safer.’ Hartley’s selection, following a three-week ban for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith before Christmas, will leave many baffled. Last season Hartley admitted his already abject disciplinary record had left him in the ‘last-chance saloon’ after he was banned for 13 weeks for swearing at referee Wayne Barnes in the Premiership final. But, with his set-piece work still unrivalled among northern hemisphere hookers, pragmatism will win the day and the serial offender will return. Sportsmail understands Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley will be involved after serving his fifth ban . Hartley makes his way off after being shown the red card for elbowing Leicester's Matt Smith in December . Nick Easter is another in-form player who needs a last-minute change of heart from England’s coaches to stand a chance of resurrecting an England career that saw him win the last of his 47 caps during the 2011 World Cup. He is still under consideration, but his chances look slim. Exeter’s Thomas Waldrom looks assured of a place as a like-for-like replacement for the stricken Morgan, alongside Billy Vunipola. The 36-year-old Easter, back in contention due to Morgan’s potentially World Cup threatening broken leg, has not been selected since Lancaster took over in 2012. But the experienced Harlequin has been the Premiership’s form No 8 this season and is desperate for one last shot at international rugby. ‘There is massive unfinished business for me as far as England is concerned,’ he said. ‘My hunger to play for England is as strong as ever, stronger probably. I believe that I am a much better player than when I was last capped.’ Nick Easter is another in-form player who needs a last-minute change of heart from England’s coaches . Easter is still under consideration by England's coaches but his chances look slim to be involved . Exeter winger Nowell will be included, despite his club’s recent league slump, with a position on the right wing against Wales in his sights following an impressive return from a long-standing knee injury this season which required surgery over the summer. Billy Twelvetrees’s alarming loss of form for Gloucester, and failure to convince on the international stage, leaves his position in jeopardy, with another Exeter youngster, Henry Slade, seen by many as the closest thing England have to Toulon’s Wallaby playmaker Matt Giteau. The midfield remains Lancaster’s biggest headache. With Tuilagi sidelined, Luther Burrell and Brad Barritt are favourites to start in Cardiff. ‘I have an eye on the Six Nations,’ said Burrell. ‘Any young player who has had a taste of it and is on the fringes of potentially being back in the mix, it will be in the back of your head. I am so hungry for that opportunity again.’ Billy Twelvetrees remains uncertain with his position in jeopardy after an alarming loss of form for Gloucester .","Stuart Lancaster and his coaching team of Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt are to meet ahead of announcing a 33- or 34-man squad .

Referee: Ian Davies (Wales) Danny Cipriani, seeking to impress England coach Stuart Lancaster for one last time before the RBS 6 Nations squad is announced on Wednesday, showed his defensive prowess in the eighth minute. Lopez and Aurelien Rougerie combined to find Wesley Fofana unmarked in support on the left flank, but Cipriani denied him a try with a vital cover tackle. Clermont led moments later when fly-half Lopez kicked a penalty, but the visitors were dealt a blow when Rougerie succumbed to an arm injury and was replaced by Jonathan Davies. Sale soon responded with a routine penalty from Cipriani, but Clermont remained dangerous when on the attack. In the 17th minute, it took a fine tackle to deny Nick Abendanon as the former Bath full-back threatened to burst clear inside Sale's 22-metre line.

"Wasps took a giant step towards the European Champions Cup quarter-finals as they stunned Harlequins 23-3 at The Stoop on Saturday evening. The victory set up a winner-takes-all showdown with Leinster, who trounced Castres 50-8 in Dublin, at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry in the final round of Pool Two next weekend. Early tries from Christian Wade and Joe Simpson set the platform for the triumph, while Andy Goode kicked 10 points along with Elliot Daly's long-range penalty effort. Quins could only muster a solitary Ben Botica penalty in reply. Joe Simpson (left) of Wasps celebrates with Nathan Hughes and Andy Goode after scoring second tr . Conor O'Shea made two changes to his starting side which dismantled Leicester 32-12 last weekend, with Will Collier coming in for Kyle Sinckler at tighthead and Tom Williams replacing Ugo Monye on the wing. Wasps director of rugby Dai Young brought Tom Varndell, Daly, Edd Shervington and Ashley Johnson into his starting line-up after his side's 39-26 loss to Bath at the Recreation Ground last Saturday. Williams was lucky not to be sent to the sin-bin in the third minute when the Quins winger collared Alapati Leuia as the Wasps centre raced onto a deft chip from Goode. Referee Nigel Owens kept his card in his pocket, despite the loud protestations from the home crowd, and Goode made no mistake from the tee as the visitors took an early 3-0 lead. Andy Goode of Wasps holds off Danny Care as he is tackled by Chris Robshaw . Quins were playing with plenty of early enterprise, but two massive errors from Danny Care and Mike Brown handed Wasps the initiative. First, Care failed to find George Lowe with an ambitious long pass, allowing Wade to collect the loose ball and race away 75 metres downfield to touch down. Goode tagged on the extras as the visitors stormed into a 10-0 advantage. Quins were left reeling, but worse was to come as Brown kicked the ball out on the full, handing Wasps a prime attacking lineout. Joe Simpson of Wasps breaks clear to score the second try against Harlequins . After strong carries from Leuia and James Haskell, Simpson spotted a gap on the edge of the ruck to snipe though and race under the posts to further increase his team's lead. Goode converted once again to cap off a dream opening quarter for the visitors. The hosts dominated possession and territory for the rest of the half, with Wasps number eight Nathan Hughes being despatched to the sin-bin for persistent infringing in the 29th minute. Quins could not capitalise on their numerical advantage, however, and failed to get onto the scoreboard before the break. Tom Varndell of Wasps stops Marland Yarde of Quins winning the ball and scoring a try . The home team needed a good start to the second half, but Goode's long-range penalty made the comeback mission all the more difficult. After turning down a number of kickable penalties in the first half, Botica finally got Quins on the scoreboard with a belated three-pointer in the 45th minute. Daly then landed a monster 50-metre penalty to make it 23-3 as veteran fly-half Nick Evans, who recovered from a groin injury to make the Harlequins bench, entered the fray in a bid to turn the tide in the final quarter. Trailing by 20 points, Quins monopolised possession but could not find a way through the stubborn Wasps defence marshalled superbly by skipper Haskell and fellow back-rower Hughes. As hordes of home fans began to leave The Stoop with 10 minutes of the contest remaining, Wasps continued their resolute defensive effort to see out an incredible victory in London.","Wasps in pole position to reach European Champions Cup quarter-finals .

"Mitchell Starc believes Australia's Tri-Series victory over England can help 'reopen a few scars' from last winter's miserable Ashes tour. England were whitewashed in the 2013/14 Test series down under and also lost both limited-overs legs, leaving the country humiliated and downtrodden. A year later they are back for a three-way one-day contest, which also involves India, before the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Ian Bell (left) was dismissed off the bowling of Mitchell Starc (centre) in the first ball of the match . Starc (second left) celebrates with his Australian team-mates after taking the wicket of Bell in the opening over . Their time away got off to a familiar start at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the home side claimed a three-wicket victory with a massive 61 balls to spare. Starc may not have had a big part to play in England's previous woes, but he started the rot this time by dismissing Ian Bell and James Taylor for ducks in the first over of the day. 'Hopefully we reopened a few scars tonight,' said the left-arm paceman. 'They're going to have to be out here for a few months now with this Tri-Series and the World Cup so there's no better way to kick off our campaign than getting one above them. 'I think we played really well with bat and ball, showed great intensity, and the only way to go is to try and improve on that.' Australia got off to the best possible start, and Starc (centre) hopes they can continue it through the series . Bell leaves the Sydney Cricket Ground pitch after being dismissed off the first ball of the match . Starc, who finished with four for 42, took man-of-the-match honours off Eoin Morgan and David Warner, who made 121 and 127 respectively. His speed helped rout England's top order and with Pat Cummins and the rested Mitchell Johnson also capable of serious pace, Starc feels that could be a key difference between the sides. 'I guess blokes bowling at 140-145kmph (87-90mph) plus is handy. It has that intimidation factor towards some of the batsmen,' he said. 'It's also about execution but having that pace is good. Pat bowled a few at 150kmph today and we obviously have Mitch coming back in at some point bowling rapid as well. It's a great combination.' Morgan excelled with the bat on his bow as England's permanent one-day captain, his century lifting the tourists towards respectability after slumping to 33 for four. Starc (right) took four for 42 and was named man-of-the-match after his impressive performance . Starc was all smiles at the end of the match, as Australia cruised to victory with 61 balls remaining . But the comprehensive defeat, which saw Australia claim a bonus point, meant he struggled to enjoy the moment. 'Overall I'm really disappointed,' he said. 'We came into the game with a lot of good preparation under our belt and within the side we would have had a lot of expectation on ourselves, so we have a lot of disappointed guys in the changing room. 'We're going to have to dust ourselves off and come back in four days (against India). 'There are certain positives we can take from the game but ultimately being four down so early has cost us. 'Simply, we weren't good enough to adapt the wicket and play accordingly. 'They bowled well up front, but nothing that we shouldn't be capable of dealing with.'

"It took only one ball of the first one-day international against Australia on Friday for England to be handed a rude reminder of the size of the task that awaits them here in the tri-series and the World Cup that follows. Once Ian Bell, who made 187 just two days ago, was trapped lbw by a rapid Mitchell Starc at the Sydney Cricket Ground, much of the optimism England garnered from two near perfect warm-up performances began to evaporate. When James Taylor followed two balls later and England then crashed to 33 for four it seemed as though this was simply a continuation of the Ashes tour from hell that reached its nadir on this same famous old ground a year ago. Ian Bell (left) was dismissed off the bowling of Mitchell Starc (centre) in the first ball of the match . Pat Cummins (second left) celebrates taking the wicket of Joe Root, who was caught behind . Jos Buttler (left) appeals unsuccessfully for the wicket of David Warner, who went on to reach a century . Thank heavens then for Eoin Morgan who made a welcome return to form and once again appeared galvanised by high office as he single-handedly saved England from one of the total humiliations common place here last winter. Yet a century from the new England one-day captain that augers well for the battles ahead was never going to be enough to stop Australia showing that they will be very much the team to beat in the World Cup that begins next month. Once David Warner got in the groove that tormented England all too often during the 5-0 thrashing Australia’s domination was clear against an attack worryingly lacking in variation and incapable of defending a sub-standard 234. As it was, Australia cruised to a win so comfortable they were able to gain a bonus point and demonstrated that they remain a formidable one-day machine even without injured captain Michael Clarke and the rested Mitchell Johnson. Eoin Morgan, England's one-day captain, top scored for the visitors with 121 runs against Australia . Warner bats during the opening match of the One Day International Tri Series between Australia and England . Warner and Aaron Finch (right), Australia's opening batsman against England, take to the field on Friday . Back to the drawing board? Not really, because England were always likely to be a one-day work in progress here with only a puncher’s chance of competing for a tri-series that also includes India and the premier 50-overs tournament. Yet they will want to do much better than this, starting when they meet that other one-day powerhouse in India in Brisbane on Tuesday and then when they face Australia yet again in Hobart next Friday. It was somehow inevitable that Bell would fail here after showing against a Prime Minister’s XI that he can produce the type of dynamic, substantial innings that has been beyond so many Englishmen in 50-over cricket. England may have breathed a sigh of relief that they did not have to face Johnson here but instead came another left-arm bowler with the pace, hostility and skill to rip the heart out of their innings before it had barely begun. England's Chris Woakes (third left) celebrates with his team-mates after taking the wicket of Finch (left) Morgan proved his worth as England's one-day captain when he came in at five to top score for the visitors . Ravi Bopara (right) plays a sweep shot on his way to 13 runs off 18 balls for England against Australia . Starc appears to have added the priceless ability to swing the ball back into right-handers to his armoury and here he was simply too quick for both Bell and Taylor as England made the worst possible start to their busiest ever year. There was a suspicion that Bell may have got an inside edge onto his pad but the replays were inconclusive and not even the Decision Review System that will not be used in this tri-series at India’s insistence would have saved him. By the time Morgan came to the crease England were in disarray – welcome to the captaincy, Eoin – but at least he was able to steady his ship and hit his first century since this time last year in Brisbane. It was desperately needed. No-one else had an answer to Starc, the equally rapid Pat Cummins, the left-arm variations of James Faulkner and even the mediocre spinner in Xavier Doherty who England were unable to attack. Shane Watson, Australia's number three, plays a shot... he eventually scored 16 runs off 20 balls for the hosts . Steve Smith watches on as his shot flies away towards the boundary at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Morgan leads the England players on to the field as a St George's Cross flies in the background . When Chris Jordan hung around with his captain long enough to add 56 for the eighth wicket England at least looked like they would reach the relative riches of 250 and give themselves something to bowl at. But Starc returned to dismiss Morgan for 121 and last man Steven Finn in successive balls and England had wasted 13 deliveries after being bowled out within 50 overs for the 10th time in their last 13 one-day internationals. Where Australia have plenty of bowling options Morgan had no choice other than to rely an attack lacking a left-armer of his own and even their main one-day spinner in James Tredwell, surprisingly left out on a worn SCG pitch. Warner’s one-day record pales into insignificance compared to his Test and Twenty20 statistics but he loves being a thorn in England’s side and once he had negotiated the two new balls there was absolutely no shifting him. Morgan gathered his England squad together to give a team-talk before they took to the field . Fans dressed up in the sun to enjoy the One Day International match of Australia against England . A view of the MA Noble and Don Bradman Stand shows the ground bathed in sunshine on Friday . England left out Jimmy Anderson to give him more time to recover from his knee problem but in his place Finn was again a shadow of the bowler who looked among the best one-day performers in the world in New Zealand in 2013. Clearly the problems that led to Finn being sent home from the Ashes tour with his action in disarray have not totally been solved yet and Finn did well to escape injury when he clattered into the stumps after losing his footing. The much improved Chris Woakes was quicker than Finn and provided encouragement with four wickets but the decision to keep Stuart Broad away from the new balls suggests he too has not fully recovered from knee surgery. The end came with more than 10 overs to spare but only three wickets in hand after Warner, who could have been given out lbw to Moeen Ali on 51, had been dismissed for 127 within sight of the winning post. England will hope Australia prove just as difficult to beat when they face India in Melbourne on Sunday, leaving them to battle it out with MS Dhoni’s side for a place in the final. Yes, this is a reality check but it was always expecting a lot for England to hit the ground running against Australia in this series. At least Morgan, who must have a good World Cup for England to have any chance, is back in business.","England won the toss and opted to bat first against Australia in Sydney .

"Eoin Morgan delivered an inspired performance with a magnificent century in his first outing as one-day captain to rescue England from a potential nightmare against Australia in Sydney. Ian Bell was trapped lbw by Mitchell Starc with the first ball before the Australian bowler claimed James Taylor to leave England 0-2 in a disastrous start to this Tri Series clash. Joe Root didn't last for long either as he departed for just five after he was caught by Shane Watson in the slip off the bowling of Pat Cummins. England one-day captain Eoin Morgan celebrates his century against Australia in Sydney . Morgan hit 11 boundaries and three sixes before he was eventually dismissed for a fantastic 121 runs . Morgan (R) celebrates his unbeaten century as his team-mate Chris Jordan applauds during their tri-series one-day cricket match against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground . But skipper Morgan steadied the ship and single-handedly rebuilt England's innings before he was caught by Glenn Maxwell and bowled by Starc for a fantastic 121 - the highest-ever score from an England one-day captain against Australia. With his sixth one-day century for England, Morgan hit 11 boundaries and three big sixes to help England set the hosts a target of 235 runs to win this World Cup warm-up. Two wickets in the first over from Starc and one from Cummins left the batting side 12 for three in the fourth over and facing embarrassment. Morgan saved them from that fate, making a dogged fifty before moving through the gears on the way to his seventh ODI hundred and first in a year. Yet there was no real support, Jos Buttler's scratchy 28 the next best effort. Australia rested England's Ashes tormentor Mitchell Johnson but his young team-mate and fellow left arm seamer Starc provided a blockbuster start to proceedings. His first ball to Bell, who came into the match on the back of 187 against the Prime Minister's XI, was an opener's nightmare - quick and swinging fractionally back towards the stumps. Bell may have got a slight inside edge but it went undetected and he was on his way lbw. Taylor suffered the same fate two balls later, though there was no doubt about his dismissal - Starc going slightly fuller with one that would have torn out leg stump. The series had started with a double-wicket maiden to the hosts and there was worse to come when Joe Root fell for five, aiming a big drive at Cummins and edging to Shane Watson at slip. Pat Cummins of Australia celebrates with team mates after taking the wicket of Joe Root . Moeen Ali attempted to rebalance the contest with a couple of powerful strokes and one wonderful pick-up six off Starc, but his charge did not last. He fell for 21, chipping James Faulkner's third ball to the waiting  Maxwell, who had only just been moved to the ropes. Morgan had a sizeable rebuilding job on his hands but needed a partner to assist him. Ravi Bopara was not that man, feeding an innocuous Xavier Doherty ball straight to point. England batsman Jos Buttler dives to the crease in partnership with captain Eoin Morgan . At 69 for five, England were in serious strife. But Morgan stayed calm and persuaded Buttler to dig in with him. The pair, both naturally aggressive strokemakers, played a cautious game but halted the slide with a sixth-wicket stand of 67. Australia spinner Doherty was a thorn in their stand, turning in 10 disciplined overs for 38, but Morgan finally got hold of him and brought up his 50 with a six down the ground. England soon suffered another setback when Buttler, already dropped once by Brad Haddin, lobbed Faulkner gently to David Warner in the outfield. Mitchell Starc  celebrates taking the wicket of Ian Bell  with the first ball of the match . But Morgan was now timing the ball sweetly and upped the rate with 11 runs off Maxwell's sixth over, including a second maximum. Morgan converted his century in style, planting Faulkner through the covers for a ninth boundary before cutting the next ball for four more. Chris Jordan chipped in with 17 and Morgan struck a couple of handsome blows off Starc before the seamer had his revenge, the centurion holing out to deep midwicket. Starc finished things by cleaning up Steve Finn first ball, returning four for 42.

"Ronnie O'Sullivan became snooker’s most prolific century-maker as he cruised into the Masters semi-finals on Thursday. The five-time world champion eclipsed the record of Stephen Hendry as he recorded his 776th career ton in the first frame of a convincing 6-1 win over Marco Fu at London’s Alexandra Palace. ‘I was a bit nervous because I knew everyone was thinking about it, so to get it out of the way was nice,’ O’Sullivan told the BBC. Ronnie O'Sullivan racked up the 776th century of his career at the Masters in London on Thursday . O'Sullivan passed Stephen Hendry's record of 775 on the way to thrashing Marco Fu 6-1 . ‘But there was still a match to play — at 1-0, I was like, “calm down”.’ The 39-year-old received a standing ovation after rattling in a break of 101 to get his match off to a perfect start. O’Sullivan had equalled Hendry’s mark of 775 in Tuesday’s win over Ricky Walden. Hendry, whose record of 42 wins at the Masters tournament was also surpassed by O’Sullivan, was commentating for the BBC as O’Sullivan reached his record-breaking ton. ‘It hasn’t been in doubt from very early on,’ said the Scot. ‘Every shot has been cued to perfection.’ Fu immediately levelled the match but O’Sullivan ground out the next two frames before easing to victory. Fu struggled to compete with O'Sullivan at Alexandra Palace and managed to win just one frame . O'Sullivan is happy with the way he is playing at the moment and will be in semi-final action on Saturday . O’Sullivan was clinical in the later frames, notably punishing Fu for missing a risky plant in the fifth and a red with the rest in the seventh. The victory took five-time winner O’Sullivan through to the semi-finals of the tournament for an 11th time. He said: ‘Marco is playing consistently well, so I knew it was going to be a tough match. He is at the business end of most tournaments and he always plays well against me, so I knew I had to be on my game. ‘The first four frames were a bit hit and miss but I was pleased I was able to not get frustrated and drain every bit out of them that I could.’","Ronnie O'Sullivan recorded the 776th century of his career .

"Mark Allen got through to the Masters quarter-finals after emerging from a high-quality contest with former winner John Higgins. The Northern Irishman was a 6-4 victor at Alexandra Palace but the scoreline did not tell the story of an outstanding tussle. The pair put on three centuries in the three opening frames, with another following later, as well as breaks of 96 and 88. Higgins also missed out on two maximum breaks, one faltering on the final yellow. It was a tough afternoon for the Scot, who took a 2-0 lead and scored 668 points but ended up on the wrong end of the result. Mark Allen salutes the crowd after prevailing 6-4 in the Masters last 16 against John Higgins (right) His slip-up on 120 in the ninth frame was the stand-out moment of misfortune. Attempting to match Marco Fu’s Sunday 147, he did not get high enough up for the yellow and had to take on a mid-ranger which rattled the jaws and spun out. ‘John has done most of the scoring,’ Allen, who posted a personal high of 121, told BBC2. ‘I have a good record against him recently and I just needed to hang in there. I stayed positive and did that.’ Allen has put himself on a strict fitness regime in 2015 in a bid to be more nimble around the table. ‘There’s certain shots out there which I can’t reach, I’m too fat,’ he added. ‘I need to lose weight.’ Allen has been in fine form this week at the Masters and next faces Joe Perry for a semi-final place .

"The clock at the Trinity Road End had ticked on to 60 minutes when, at long last, Aston Villa finally got a clear sight of goal. Andreas Weimann nodded the ball into Christian Benteke’s path and, as he steadied himself, only one outcome looked possible. History suggests Liverpool crumble when pressure is applied and this looked like the moment when they would concede. Standing firm, though, was Simon Mignolet. Benteke may have unleashed fury from his right foot, smashing his drive towards the Holte End net, but Mignolet - so often lampooned for his mistakes - would not be beaten. Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet earned boss Brendan Rodgers' praise during their win at Aston Villa . Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke (right) saw his blistering shot saved by Liverpool's  Mignolet (left) The Belgian parried away Benteke’s blockbuster before leaping up to punch the loose ball off Weimann’s head. Moments later, when a corner was flung in as Villa tried to find a way through, Mignolet came charging out, bulldozing through everyone in front of him to claim possession. This was more like it. Mignolet has had a poor season, his low point coming when he was dropped for the December 15 trip to Old Trafford, but here was a performance to show why he was bought. For the first time in a long while, he exuded the authority of a Liverpool No 1. ‘I thought he was outstanding,’ said Brendan Rodgers. ‘Simon wasn’t overly worked but he made two great saves when called upon. But what was really pleasing was how dominant he was. Benteke is nearly unstoppable in the air when he is challenging for the ball. But Simon came for a number of crosses and got contact with the ball and was really calm and composed and wasn’t flustered. The team as a whole defended very, very well but I was particularly pleased for him as he has had a wee bit of stick. I thought he was excellent.’ Mignolet wasn’t the only one. Liverpool were pushed hard by Villa, particularly in the second half, but they were resolute and didn’t look as if they would concede. That, certainly, is a sign they are making progress. Mignolet (right) commanded his penalty area with authority and dealt with aerial balls well at Villa Park . Defending has been Liverpool’s achilles heel under Rodgers. In his first campaign, they kept 21 clean sheets in 54 games. Last year, there were only 12 shut-outs in 43 matches, while this year the record is seven from 32 fixtures. The picture, however, has changed dramatically recently. They have not conceded on their last three away trips at Burnley, Sunderland and Villa - the first time they have had such a run since 2008 - and this was the first time they had kept back-to-back clean sheets this campaign. That big moment from Mignolet was crucial but so were the contributions of Mamadou Sakho, Martin Skrtel and Emre Can, the German midfielder who has slotted so effortlessly into a role on the right side of a back three. Jordan Henderson and Lucas Leiva were also key. ‘What a wonderful player he is,’ Rodgers enthused about Can, his £10million signing from Bayer Leverkusen. ‘He is a central midfield player but [in defence] his composure, calmness and strength against Benteke was very impressive.’ Bigger tests, of course, must be negotiated in the coming weeks but if Liverpool are to salvage a season that looked to be undermined by a bad back, this defensive renaissance has to continue. The free spirits might just be turning into the mean spirits.

"Crystal Palace had lost the 'hunger' instilled by Tony Pulis under Neil Warnock, according to new manager Alan Pardew. New Eagles boss Pardew has quizzed both Selhurst Park predecessors Pulis and Warnock on his south London Premier League survival bid. The former Newcastle boss hailed Pulis' Palace for finishing 11th in the league last term, before conceding Warnock suffered second-season syndrome when he took the helm in August. Alan Pardew has called on his side to replicate the hunger they had previously shown under Tony Pulis . Crystal Palace finished 11th in the Premier League last season thanks to the help of former boss Pulis . 'I think last year they were hungry and that hunger came out in that run that took them 11th,' said Pardew. 'The second year sometimes is a bit more dangerous because that hunger just goes off a bit. 'And if there's one thing I want to put back into that group it's that hunger. 'I think they've been missing that a little bit, that hunger they had last year. 'Once the hunger goes out a little, it's difficult to reignite that.' Former Stoke boss Pulis walked out on Palace on the eve of the season after rowing with Eagles chairman Steve Parish over transfer targets. Ex-Sheffield United manager Warnock came out of retirement to plug Palace's gap in August, but was sacked in December after a run of one win in 11 games. Neil Warnock (left) was sacked after failing to get the best out of his players . Pardew guided Palace to a 2-1 home win over Spurs in his first Premier League game at the Selhurst helm, with his side facing Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday. The former Palace midfielder admitted sympathy with Warnock's position, having to fight to restore the spark Pulis lit at the club. 'I always worry about a team in the second year, wherever they are, I always think it's a little bit more difficult for the manager when you've had it one year,' said Pardew. 'We showed a little bit of that hunger against Spurs and hopefully we can keep that going moving forward now too.' Pardew suffered relegation from the Premier League as Charlton manager, but managed to steer Newcastle away from a basement scrap in his first season on Tyneside. The Eagles go into their league match against Burnley on the back of a 2-1 win against Tottenham . The 53-year-old believes those two experiences will steel him for the challenge of keeping Palace in the Premier League this term. 'The biggest learning curve I had was my first year at Newcastle,' said Pardew. 'We were not too far away from the bottom and we sold Andy Carroll for £30million and I didn't get a replacement. 'That was one of my biggest achievements I think as a manager. 'The pressure we were under, it was only our first year in the Premier League, and I would say I think we played above ourselves that year, to finish without really having ourselves in any pressure situation. 'We always kept ourselves out of it and if there's one hope I've got for Crystal Palace it's that we can do that. 'If we can get a couple of quick wins in the next three or four we can give ourselves a bit of breathing space and try to stay away. Because once you're down the bottom it's very, very difficult.'","Alan Pardew believe Palace have lost hunger shown under Tony Pulis .

Here is all the information you need for West Ham's home clash with Hull... West Ham United vs Hull (Upton Park) Team news . West Ham . West Ham boss Sam Allardyce is hoping for a double defensive fitness boost ahead of Sunday's visit of Hull. Winston Reid (ankle) missed the FA Cup third-round replay win over Everton on Tuesday but is now back in training, as is full-back Guy Demel who has been sidelined since the turn of the year with a muscle problem. That means only top-scorer Diafra Sakho (back) and Cheikhou Kouyate (international duty) are definite absentees. Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, O'Brien, Reid, Demel, Collins, Jenkinson, Noble, Song, Nolan, Amalfitano, Downing, Poyet, Jarvis, Vaz Te, Cole, Carroll, Valencia. Andy Carroll rifled his left footed shot into the top corner past Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski . Hull .

"Ronald Koeman's remarkable job with Southampton continued to progress on Saturday afternoon as his rebuilt Saints squad defeated Newcastle 2-1 at St James' Park. January loan signing Eljero Elia fired in both goals to keep the south coast side third in the Premier League, holding Champions League qualification chasers Manchester United and Arsenal at bay. Here is all you need to know about the latest canny bit of business by Koeman... Eljero Elia salutes the travelling Southampton fans after his brace secured three points at Newcastle . Eljero Elia (left) scored twice at Newcastle, his first goals in English football since joining the Saints on loan . WHO IS HE? The 27-year-old Dutchman joined on loan from Werder Bremen at the start of the month. WHAT’S HIS HISTORY? Played for ADO Den Haag and FC Twente in Holland, then Hamburg and Juventus before joining Bremen in 2012. He has 27 caps for Holland, including an appearance as a substitute in the 2010 World Cup final. Elia (left) ran straight to Southampton boss Ronald Koeman to share his first goal for the club on Saturday . WHAT KIND OF PLAYER IS HE? A fast, strong winger. WHAT ABOUT HIS PERSONALITY? No shrinking violet. He left his first club after falling out with the manager. He has had rows with fans on social media and he was fined by Hamburg for complaining that they had not looked after him enough following an ankle operation.

"John Carver has called on Newcastle United’s hierarchy to resolve their vacant head coach position during the next fortnight. The Magpies – beaten 2-1 by Southampton on Saturday – fly to Dubai for a four-day break on Sunday and do not play again until their trip to Hull on January 31. Caretaker boss Carver would still like the job on a permanent basis but concedes his chances may have gone after a third defeat in four matches since taking over from Alan Pardew. VIDEO Scroll down to see John Carver's plea to the Newcastle United board . Caretaker manager John Carver shows he has passion and desire to be Newcastle boss . Newcastle were denied a late penalty when Jose Fonte handled in the area, and Carver says Robert Madley’s failure to award the spot-kick could prove costly for himself. ‘It’s a penalty, no danger,’ he said. ‘When it smacks you on the palm of your hand it’s a penalty. ‘These decisions can have an impact on people’s future. You need a stroke of luck like that because jobs are decided on decisions such as that.’ Tim Krul (left) is left a mere spectator as Eljero Elia's fizzing shot goes underneath him in the Newcastle goal . Newcastle have spoken to former Lyon boss Remi Garde but he would prefer to wait until the summer were he to be offered the role. Either way, Carver wants a decision before the end of the month. ‘I want this uncertainty to end – I think everyone does,’ he said. ‘The staff, the crowd, and myself. I still love this and want to do it. But sometimes it’s out of your hands. Elia (left) scored the winning goal for Southampton in the second half with a deflected effort . ‘Everybody isn’t sure what is going on. I think after the result tonight a decision has to be made – whether it’s me or someone else. ‘But you’ve got to win football matches (to get the job).’ Eljero Elia was Southampton’s two-goal hero – scoring either side of Yoan Gouffran’s equaliser – but Carver thought his side were worthy of at least a point. ‘I thought we deserved to get something from it,’ he added. Florin Gardos' (centre left) clearance hits winger Gouffran (right) before going into into the net . ‘We conceded two bad goals. We were caught out twice by two long balls up to the frontman. ‘We worked on it all week, dealing with Pelle and runners in behind, so it’s disappointing that both goals came in the same way. ‘But we don’t have that cutting edge. When we get in the final third it either breaks down or we don’t have enough leaders to take responsibility and put the ball in the back of the net.’","Newcastle were beaten 2-1 at home by Southampton on Saturday .

"Jose Mourinho hailed the 'perfect game' after his Chelsea side underlined their Barclays Premier League title credentials by sweeping aside Swansea 5-0 at the Liberty Stadium. Oscar and Diego Costa both scored twice in the first half to put Chelsea in cruise control before substitute Andre Schurrle grabbed a fifth goal 11 minutes from time to ensure Swansea suffered their heaviest home defeat for 24 years. 'It was a perfect game, everything went in our direction,' Chelsea manager Mourinho said. Chelsea's  midfielder Oscar scored twice as Chelsea won 5-0 away at Swansea City on Saturday . 'To score a goal in the first minute makes an immediate difference. To be 4-0 up at half-time is not game over, especially in the Premier League, but it's a good situation to control and we did that in the second half. 'I was on the bench saying they were similar goals in terms of principles as the one we scored against Burnley in the first game of the season. 'The team is playing with high quality and has a clear identity of playing. Sometimes teams are good and play well without the clear identity, but all this season we are going in a certain direction and have a certain kind of way to play football.' Chelsea's win opened up a five-point lead on their nearest challengers Manchester City, who entertain Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, but Mourinho felt the victory would not increase the pressure on Manuel Pellegrini's chasers. Blues striker Diego Costa (second left) also added a double as Chelsea cruised to victory . 'I don't think they feel it (pressure),' Mourinho said. 'They have to win but they know that. 'We don't feel pressure, we feel responsibility, and for them it's not a problem. 'A team like them with the experience they have - much more than us - it's not a problem. 'I keep saying the same to my players and they have to understand it, there is no history without titles so if we play fantastically well and we don't win cups in 20 years time no one will remember this team. 'I am the first one that wants the team to play well but we have to win competitions. 'This team is a young team with lots of years in front of them, but we are trying this season to make some history by winning something.' Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was delighted with his side's dominant display against the Swans . Mourinho said he felt for his opposite number Garry Monk, who was without three midfielders in Leon Britton, Jonjo Shelvey and Ki Sung-yueng and who was forced to play Gylfi Sigurdsson in an unfamiliar deeper role. Swansea also appeared to carry a hangover following the £25million midweek sale of top scorer Wilfried Bony and Monk later apologised for a performance which never recovered from Sigurdsson losing possession inside the first minute for Oscar to open the scoring. 'I said sorry to Jose that I couldn't give him a game today,' Monk said. 'It was a horrible performance and the first 45 minutes was our worst of the season. 'It's difficult to make those mistakes continuously and against a Chelsea side like that it magnifies it even more. 'We didn't give fans the performance we wanted and I can only apologise because it's my team and I take full responsibility for that.' Swansea boss Garry Monk has apologised to the fans for his team's display against Chelsea . But Monk insisted that Swansea's heaviest home defeat since a 6-1 thrashing to Wigan in April 1991 would not derail a league campaign which has seen them placed in the top 10 all season. 'The good thing is we're still in a good position and I don't worry about the long-term because I know the characters in that dressing room,' Monk said. 'It's one performance we have to reflect on and learn from but every time we've had a disappointment we've reacted straight away and this defeat won't define our season.'","Premier League leaders Chelsea won 5-0 away at Swansea on Saturday .

"The Rangers board say they will fight Dave King's attempt to force them out of the club using a shareholder vote - but admit they may have to mortgage off Ibrox in the meantime. Former Oldco director King has called a general meeting as he starts the process of removing chairman David Somers, chief executive Derek Llambias, finance director Barry Leach and director James Easdale from their positions of power - replacing them with himself, former Blue Knight Paul Murray and John Gilligan, the one-time managing director of Glasgow brewer Tennent's. But in the first of two 7am statements to the Stock Exchange, the Gers board say they will ask King to withdraw his bid in order to save the cash-strapped club the expense of hosting the meeting, and if he does not they will recommend the South Africa-based businessman's motions are voted down. Rangers Chairman David Somers (left) with Derek Llambias (right) The Rangers board have conceded that Ibrox may have to be mortgaged off . Dave King plans to oust the current Rangers board by calling a shareholders' vote . If the meeting is to go ahead, it must take place between three and six weeks from Friday when the board were informed. King now faces a race against time to build an anti-board coalition with enough shares to win a majority vote but can expect support from the likes of the Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor. The two groups own around 34 per cent of the club between them - roughly the same portion as controlled by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley and the Easdale brothers. Off-field politics have prompted numerous protests from Rangers fans . The statement said: 'The company is currently verifying that the notice (issued by King) is properly constituted. If valid, the board intends to seek to have such notice withdrawn in order to avoid the cost and disruption of an ad hoc general meeting. The AIM rules require that all individuals appointed to the board of an AIM company are suitable to be a director of a UK public company. 'If the notice is valid and is not withdrawn, the directors intend to recommend that shareholders vote against the proposed resolutions. A circular will be sent to shareholders in accordance with the act, however in the meantime the directors will not be distracted from the more important matter of securing the future of the business. A further announcement will be made shortly.' In their second statement, the directors conceded they may have to consider using Ibrox as security on a loan - but insisted any decision would not be 'taken lightly'. Any move to use the stadium or the Murray Park training ground as collateral will prove highly controversial. Thousands of fans have already protested against that possibility before Friday night's abandoned clash with Hearts after it was revealed Mike Ashley was preparing to have his name added to the title deeds of both properties as part of a £10million loan arrangement. The Three Bears have already announced they will increase their own loan offer of £5million - but will not ask for security on the stadium. Mike Ashley (left) appointed his associate Derek Llambias (right) as Rangers Chief Executive in December . The second board statement said: 'The board notes press speculation and shareholder concern in relation to an advanced notice for a charge over Ibrox stadium. The company continues to need funding, including urgent short-term financing. 'Over the past few weeks the company has held discussions with a number of parties with a view to finding a stable financial future for the business. The discussions, which have been wide ranging, including both stakeholders and third parties, are with a view to achieving the best possible terms for the business. Without the authority to issue equity on a non pre-emptive basis, the directors cannot issue shares in the timeframe required. 'At the current time the assets (other than Ibrox), cash flow and business of Rangers does not support a significant financing, on an open market commercial basis, to achieve the goals which the directors have set for the club. 'Accordingly the directors are pursuing bilateral discussions with two parties who are both stakeholders in Rangers. These discussions contemplate a significant amount of capital being available to the business on a long-term basis in order to enhance the squad which the directors believe is necessary. A consequence of funding to this level is that, in reality, it may be necessary to use Ibrox stadium as security; such a decision would not be taken lightly. 'No decision has been taken at the current time while discussions are being finalised in good faith. The advance notice does not mean that security will be given, and the directors are adamant that it will not unfairly advantage the party with whom it was agreed. The board will conclude a transaction, based on its merits, which it believes is in the best interests of shareholders as a whole in accordance with their fiduciary duty.' Shareholders arrive at Ibrox Stadium in Glasgow, ahead of the 2014 Rangers AGM. The Rangers directors announced earlier this month that they require 'urgent' funding just to see the club through January, but they were forced to knock back US financier Robert Sarver's £20million takeover bid after admitting they could not get enough shareholder support to vote it through. King will only have made his move if he is certain he can carry with him at least 51 per cent of the shareholders. But even if they do sweep out the existing directors, they could still face problems with Ashley, who controls the Ibrox retail division at rates highly beneficial to his Sports Direct empire.","The Rangers board say they will fight Dave King's attempt to oust them .

"The departure of the Greatest Ever Ranger caused real concern. The decision by his old gaffer to walk away then definitely started the alarm bells ringing. When former team-mate Ally McCoist decided he could no longer serve under the current board, Stuart McCall became convinced that all hope was lost. ‘Imagine Bobby Charlton at Man United saying: “You know what? I’ve had enough of the club”,’ said the former Ibrox midfielder. ‘Then Sir Alex Ferguson departing because something was going on — and then Ryan Giggs leaving. If that happened at Man United, imagine how everyone would react. They’d be asking: “What is going on?”. Rangers fans display a 'Forever Ibrox' banner after continuing their pre-match protests on Friday . Stuart McCall, who played for Rangers from 1991-1998, fears for the club since Ally McCoist departed . Mike Ashley reportedly attempted to get security over Rangers' stadium and training ground . ‘At Rangers, we’ve had Walter Smith, Coisty and John Greig walking out. That’s what would worry me. What is going on in there? ‘Yeah, football is a business now. But is there anybody in there actually doing it for the sake of the club? ‘Or are they just in to make a few quid then disappear into the night? Over the past few years, that has been the case. ‘John Greig stayed away, which for me is hard to get my head round. Walter left the board and, again, alarm bells started ringing. If Walter is walking away when you need somebody there, it must be bad. You know that, for him to go, he must have had his reasons. Ally McCoist, on the touchline as Rangers manager, left the role in December after three years in charge . ‘For John Greig not to be there means stuff must be going on that people can’t quite see. Obviously, the great Sandy Jardine passed away, unfortunately. And now Coisty is away. So there are four great Rangers men who have departed the club.’ McCall is, like all with Rangers at heart, greatly saddened by the continued struggles of a club gifted tens of millions of pounds by supporters who believed in ‘the journey’ from a starting point at the bottom of the senior game. Like anyone with an interest in or knowledge of football as a business, he remains suspicious of the moves and motives that have led Rangers to the brink of insolvency. The Rangers board considered mortgaging off Ibrox  in return for a £10million loan from Mike Ashley . ‘Rangers are possibly in an even worse state now than they were when they went down to the bottom tier,’ he said. ‘What has gone on off the park at Rangers for the last three years, as a supporter, player, manager or part of the coaching staff — I speak to the coaching staff — you just don’t know what is going to happen next or who you can trust. ‘A new guy comes in and it’s: “Oh yeah, great, he’s going to put money in.”. Then that falls flat and somebody else goes in, all while there is money going out of the club. ‘There has been a whole load of mismanagement off the park, I think that’s plain for everyone to see. ‘Listen, I think Rangers going into administration and going down to the bottom tier was a boot in the b***s. A big setback. Kenny Miller (right) during the clash with Hearts on Friday, which had to be abandoned due to adverse weather . Rangers fans protest before Friday's match with Hearts over claims that Ibrox is to be mortgaged off . Rangers fans stormed an entrance at Ibrox to  voice their feelings against the board on Friday night . One of the supporter's flags read: 'Rangers F.C. supported by fans, directed by parasites' ‘But even then people thought: “Right, they’ve bottomed out, they can build again, build up”. And it’s just not happened. ‘People couldn’t believe Rangers were getting 45,000 or whatever against Elgin City and the like. So the support stood by them and remained steadfast as they rolled through the bottom two divisions. ‘But, when you get to this stage, you have to be ready for it. If the club had been managed properly, they would have been able to go back into the top flight and be stronger. ‘It’s just been one calamity after another. People coming in, then leaving. I think the fans put in about £20million — and now they need so many million just to survive. ‘Not just Rangers fans, any fan of football would be asking: “How can that be so? Where has that money gone?”. Those fans are now in open revolt against the current regime, with elements of Friday night’s demonstration outside Ibrox turning violent as some tried to gain access to club offices. Dave King has called a general meeting to ask Rangers shareholders to rout the entire Ibrox board on Friday . McCall said: ‘I think the other night was just everything coming to a head. That’s why there was such a big demonstration. ‘Obviously, you don’t condone any violence, although I don’t think there was much of that, to be fair. Protest is OK. ‘The thing that really brought it to a head was finding out the ground was going to be put up as security on a loan, the board having told everyone at the last AGM that this would never happen. The fans have had enough. ‘I think the fans would come back, no doubt. I don’t think there is a case of generations of fans being lost. Police and stewards hold people back as Hearts and Rangers fans attempt to confront each other inside Ibrox . ‘They went to the fourth tier and still got 45,000 fans, 30,000 in the third tier. Rangers have fans across the world and are a huge brand, even though people don’t perceive that just now. ‘It would be a silly thing to say just now, but they still have support across the world. It goes hand in hand, it also needs to be done on the park. ‘There is no reason that Rangers can’t be playing top flight next year. If they get there, will more money be ploughed into the club? Would more investors be interested? ‘I’m sure there would be and supporters won’t turn their backs on Rangers. There are people there who will always be there.’ Although McCall feels promotion is a possibility, he accepts that it will have to come via the play-offs. And that’s assuming the emergency sale of Lewis Macleod to Brentford is the last cut-price departure during this transfer window. With one eye on the Old Firm League Cup semi-final to come, the former Scotland midfielder said: ‘No disrespect to Brentford because they are flying in the Championship, but it shows how far Rangers have slipped. ‘Looking to the game with Celtic, Rangers cannot afford to lose any more players before then, that is for sure.’","Fans protested against the Ibrox board before and after Hearts match .

"Norwich City withstood a determined second-half fightback from Cardiff City to make it a winning start for new boss Alex Neil at Carrow Road. The Canaries ended up sneaking home 3-2 after appearing to be in total command with a 3-0 lead at half-time. Goals from Gary Hooper, Kyle Lafferty and Cameron Jerome, together with a penalty save from John Ruddy, made it a miserable opening period for the visitors. Norwich City's Gary Hooper celebrates with his team-mates after his opener against Cardiff City . The Canaries' Kyle Lafferty celebrates scoring his side's second goal at Carrow Road on Saturday . But they then made a game of it by scoring twice in three minutes around the hour mark through Alex Revell and Kadeem Harris and might have come away with a draw in the end. New Norwich manager Neil was given a rousing reception before kick-off and his team responded to a cracking atmosphere by dominating the early stages. It took an excellent one-handed stop from Cardiff keeper Simon Moore to keep out a Hooper snap shot on eight minutes - but he could nothing to prevent the same player from opening the scoring on the quarter-of-an-hour mark. Nathan Redmond's cross from the right found the head of Jerome and he nodded the ball on for his strike partner to convert from close range at the back post. Cardiff might have equalised five minutes later when a corner was missed by Norwich keeper Ruddy and Sean Morrison failed to convert from close range. Cameron Jerome (centre) gestures to the Norwich crowd after scoring what turned out to be the winner . But the hosts looked the stronger side and it needed another good stop from Moore to keep out a fiercely struck shot from Gary O'Neil. The Canaries then caught the visitors on the break to make it 2-0 on 25 minutes. The ball fell to Lafferty in oceans of space out on the left and had plenty of time to pick his spot, with his curling shot finding the back of the net via the far post. The Bluebirds should have been back in it almost immediately when Carlos Cuellar was adjudged to have tripped Adam Le Fondre in the box but Ruddy made a superb save to his left to deny Peter Whittingham from the spot. The penalty had come after a swift Cardiff break - and the Welsh side again caught Norwich short five minutes from the interval, only for Revell to scoop the ball over from inside the six-yard box. Cardiff's Aron Gunnnarsson (left) competes with Norwich's Nathan Redmond on Saturday . The points appeared to be wrapped up in stoppage-time when Norwich scored their third. A buccaneering run from Russell Martin took the defender deep into the visitors' area and, when his effort was blocked, Jerome was on hand to steer home his 14th goal of the season from close range. Norwich continued to go hunting for goals after the break and Redmond saw his rising drive come back off the crossbar while Jerome's far post header went just wide a couple of minutes later. Cardiff kept battling away though and got one back on 61 minutes. Whittingham picked out Revell at the back post and the big striker coolly side-footed home to open his account for his new club. It was a goal the visitors deserved as it had not been a one-sided game by any means, and they were right back in it a couple a minutes later when they got a second. Cardiff's Sean Morrison (left) and Norwich's Redmond (right) challenge for the ball at Carrow Road . A long punt forward from keeper Moore deceived the home defence and substitute Harris nipped in to lob the ball over Ruddy. It needed another good save from Moore to prevent Redmond from making it 4-2 while substitute Wes Hoolahan fired just over as the hosts started to regain the upper hand. Cardiff still posed a threat however and Revell went close to completing what would have been a remarkable comeback 10 minutes from time with a header that drifted just wide.","Norwich City beat Cardiff City 3-2 at Carrow Road on Saturday .

"Host commentator . Host commentator . Barcelona will face Atletico Madrid in the quarter finals of the Copa del Rey after a convincing win against La Liga strugglers Elche. The game was over after Barca's 5-0 win in the first leg but Luis Enrique's side maintained their professionalism to complete the job. Adriano heads in Barcelona's fourth to complete the scoring with just seconds to go. Ter Stegen is called into action as he palms out the first shot before making sure he holds on to the second effort at goal. We are into the final minute. Elche are trying their best to score a goal but they have been unable to really test Ter Stegen. Sportsmail's Rik Sharma: 'Alen Halilovic is the SEVENTH youth player that Luis Enrique has given his debut to since he has been at the club. Whatever you think of the coach, he's certainly buying in to the La Masia philosophy. He might as well as he won't be buying anything else because of the transfer ban.' Halilovic produces a terrific piece of skill before curling the ball towards goal. However the woodwork comes to Elche's rescue as his shot cannons off the post. He looks a real talent. 20 minutes left to play. Barcelona's youngsters are playing in a similar mould to the first team. Neat, intricate passing in the final third. No wonder Enrique is all smiles. Highly-rated teenager Alen Halilovic has been brought on to make his debut for Barcelona's first team. The Catalan giants beat off competition from their European rivals to sign the 18-year-old in the summer. It feels like a low-profile friendly match now. An easy night for Barcelona's players. Elche have rarely threatened despite trying their best to give their fans something to celebrate. Sportsmail's Rik Sharma: 'Some interesting goalkeeping from Ter Stegen there. Perhaps he's been watching too much of his countryman, Manuel Neuer. Then again, maybe he thinks he can handle an outfield jaunt tonight because Elche haven't been at the races so far. Chelsea youngster Pasalic, meanwhile, has made three not-inconsiderable fouls, but has thus far avoided a booking. Jose Mourinho will be taking note.' Goalscorer Roberto will be hoping he can impress enough to earn himself a start in La Liga. However it must be hard for the 22-year-old when you are competing with Neymar and Messi. Barcelona starlet Adama should have added a fourth however his cross-cum-shot goes just wide of Manu Herrera's goal. The moment of the first half was definitely Mathieu's free-kick. Messi would have been proud of that strike! Enrique's side are 3-0 up on the night without even stepping into second gear. Elche's players will be dreading the second half. Munir is fouled inside the area - leaving Pedro to net from the spot. It's just too easy for Barcelona's 'weakened' side. Sergi Roberto doubles his side's lead with a left-footed drive from the edge of the box. It is now 7-0 to Barcelona on aggregate. Pique must have woken up after that strike! Substitute Gerard Pique looks extremely bored on the subs' bench. He probably wanted the night off alongside the likes of Messi and Neymar. Pedro ran to celebrate with Mathieu after the opener. Barcelona's stand-in captain is being given the time and space to dictate play but has not been able to unlock Elche's defence thus far. Sportsmail Rik Sharma: 'Only around 8,000 here tonight, but who can blame Elche's fans? It's been a miserable season and with Barcelona 5-0 up from the first leg, there's not even the draw of seeing any of the major Blaugrana stars. Oh, and the game kicked off at 10pm local time - on a school night.' Mathieu's last goal came at the back end of last season for Valencia. He was congratulated by his team-mates after his opener. Sportsmail's Rik Sharma: 'Jeremy Mathieu has been a good signing this season but people frequently comment that he can look a bit cumbersome, a bit clumsy. There was nothing cumbersome about that free kick though. Lionel Messi has some competition for those set-plays...' Mathieu's goal was his first competitive goal for Barcelona. I wonder if Messi will let the Frenchman take free-kicks in future matches... Albacar gets a yellow card for a deliberate foul. Barcelona open the scoring with a tremendous free-kick through Matheiu. 18 minutes gone and Barcelona's defenders seem to be content with passing the ball around. Elche look lively but have not threatened Ter Stegen's goal. Pedro is captaining Barcelona in the absence of Messi, Xavi and Iniesta. Adrian has just missed a great chance from close range. Nine minutes gone here. Attention has turned to Barcelona who are hoping to book a date with Atletico Madrid. Messi, Suarez and Neymar have all been given a night off due to Barca's 5-0 lead. The holders are out! Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid have drawn 2-2 in their second leg meaning Atletico go through 4-2 on aggregate. Fernando Torres was on target twice for Atletico. 'In stark contrast to the scenes we saw outside of the Santiago Bernabeu, with the streets full of supporters, there's little atmosphere for this game. It's largely because Barcelona ended it in the first leg, with a brutal and relentless barrage of attacks that saw off Elche. That said, there was still a fair crowd to greet Barcelona's team bus tonight. 'What tonight's about, for Luis Enrique, is giving the youngsters a chance to shine and making sure the team arrives in high spirits for the trip to the Riazor, to face Deportivo la Coruna on Sunday.' The teams are in... Barcelona have made a number of changes . Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Montoya, Bartra, Mathieu, Adriano, Gumbau, Sergi Roberto, Rafinha, Pedro, Munir, Adama . Subs: Masip, Pique, Rakitic, Douglas, Halilovic, Ie, Diagne . Elche: Manu Herrera, Peral, Lomban, Pelegrin, Edu Albaca, Galvez, Pasalic, Coro, Alvaro, Fragapane, Cristian Herrera . Subs: Pol Freixanet, Enzo Roco, Domingo Cisma, Aaron, Adrian, Faycal Fajr, Moha . Hello and welcome to the Copa del Rey clash between Elche and Barcelona. Barcelona won the first leg 5-0 at the Nou Camp last week, so there is little doubt about who will progress to the next round. Luis Enrique changed his Barcelona line-up for the 28th time in a row, dropping Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez, but this time nobody was complaining as they racked up a big victory to ease through to the Copa del Rey quarter-finals. The Asturian coach put out an entirely different side to the team that saw off Atletico Madrid last weekend and the reserves responded impressively, to offer Diego Simeone's side the chance of revenge in the next round. Two brilliant first half goals from Jeremy Mathieu and Sergi Roberto set Barcelona on their way, before Pedro and Adriano added two more, and their team did the footballing equivalent of putting their feet up and having a doze in front of the fire, gently stirred by the odd Elche effort whizzing over the crossbar.

"The Russian Football Union has failed to achieve its goal of paying national team coach Fabio Capello his unpaid wages by the end of the year. Capello has not received any of his reported £7million-a-year ($11m) salary since June amid financial problems at the RFU. The organization's president Nikolai Tolstykh said Monday he planned to resolve the issue by the end of 2014, but told local media Wednesday that was now impossible. Fabio Capello (left) sits alongside Patrick Kluivert at the Dubai International Sports Conference this week . With Russia gearing up for almost two weeks of public holidays and days off work, Tolstykh said it had been hard to find sources of funding to pay the veteran Italian coach. Unpaid wages were 'not a topic for the New Year holidays,' he told the R-Sport agency, adding that talks would resume January 12.

"Fabio Capello claims Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is failing to get the best from summer signing Luis Suarez. Suarez, who signed for Barca from Liverpool in a £75million deal in July, has been mainly deployed in a wide position from Enrique and has scored just two goals in 10 games for the Catalan giants. Russia manager Capello believes the Uruguay forward would be more help to the team if playing centrally. Barcelona star Luis Suarez is being wasted out wide, claims Russia manager Fabio Capello . 'His coach knows more than us, but the wing is not the best place for Suarez,' Capello told Onda Cero. 'He's a goalscorer and you lose 50 per cent of that on the wing. 'You need to be in the centre, not on the wing. Luis Suarez is one of the best strikers in the world and I think that Luis Enrique is trying to find a tactical solution to this. 'While I think this Barcelona team has the same desire to hoard the ball as before, they do not have the same speed as they used to.' Suarez has scored just two goals in 10 games for the Spanish club since his move from Liverpool . Capello believes Manchester City will need a fit Sergio Aguero to defeat Barcelona next year . The former England boss also declared that Barcelona should have little trouble brushing aside Manchester City in the forthcoming Champions League last 16 matches. The only way the English champions can win is to hope Sergio Aguero is fit, thinks Capello. He added: 'I do not think Man City will be a difficult opponent for Barcelona,' he added. 'City did not do well in qualifying because they are missing something - they lack speed and they lack desire. 'At this point, they would be easy opponents for Barca. But, in February we'll see because they will have [injured forward] Sergio Aguero back. He's one of the best players in world football.'

"Russia manager Fabio Capello, who has gone unpaid since June, is likely to get his back-pay in full next month according to Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko. It was reported earlier this month that Capello has not been paid amid financial problems at the Russian Football Union, who have simply been unable to afford his £7million per-year contract that he signed in January. 'I can say for a fact that the Russian Football Union simply does not have enough money to pay Capello's salary,' executive committee member Sergey Stepashin said in November.

But Mutko claims the issue will be sorted in December and Capello will be paid in full for his work since June. 'By the end of the year, the situation should be resolved, the debt to Capello should be cleared,' Mutko told Russian media. While Mutko played a key role in hiring Capello, he suggested there would be no government financial help and that 'the RFU should do it by itself,' even though the organization says it lacks the money.

"Hull have enquired about Blackburn Rovers striker Rudy Gestede. The 26-year-old has also been the subject of interest from West Brom. Bruce looks set to miss out on former Tottenham striker Jermain Defoe, who is set to move to Sunderland, as his search for a striker continues.

"Jermain Defoe is to undergo a medical at Sunderland as he closes in on a return to English football. The 32-year-old Toronto FC striker will have medical checks within the next 24 hours with a view to completing his switch to the Black Cats. Sunderland have been engaged in advanced talks with Defoe recently and now look to be closing in on a capture they hope will significantly boost their attacking threat. Jermain Defoe will undergo a medical at Sunderland as he closes in on a move to the Black Cats . The Black Cats have turned to the former Tottenham front man after scoring just 18 goals in their opening 21 Barclays Premier League fixtures of the season, with Steven Fletcher, Connor Wickham and Jozy Altidore having contributed only six of them. It is understood chairman Ellis Short and sporting director Lee Congerton have put together a lucrative package to lure Defoe not only back to his native country, but also to the north east after it became clear he was looking for a way out of Major League Soccer after less than a year in America. Sources on Wearside were cautiously optimistic that a deal could be done on Wednesday morning, and that optimism grew when news of the medical emerged. However, the transfer could yet depend on United States international Altidore, whose future has been the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks, and his proposed move in the opposite direction. Defoe (left) joined MLS side Toronto FC during the summer but is keen on return to England . That switch would have to be ratified by MLS, which operates an allocation process, and meet with Altidore’s approval to allow the Defoe transfer to go through. Defoe only joined Toronto during the summer, but, despite having scored 11 goals in 16 league appearances after signing a four-year deal, he has not settled and has been courted by a series of Premier League clubs. He has been training with Spurs, Sunderland’s next league opponents on Saturday, in recent days. The Londoner, who worked briefly with Sunderland boss Gus Poyet during his time at Tottenham, has scored goals throughout his club career and has 19 in 55 appearances for England to his name. That is something Altidore has singularly failed to do since arriving on Wearside from Dutch club AZ Alkmaar in a £6.5million in July 2013. The 25-year-old, who also signed a four-year deal, has scored just three times for the club in 52 outings.

"Australia's cricketers have failed to honour the memory of batsman Phillip Hughes by sledging again, according to BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew. The sport was shaken by the death of Hughes on November 27 after a bouncer hit him below the line of his helmet during a Sheffield Shield match in Sydney. He died three days short of his 26th birthday. In an emotional funeral that was broadcast around the world, Australia captain Michael Clarke delivered a moving eulogy in which he pledged: ‘Phillip’s spirit, which is now part of our game for ever, will act as a custodian of the sport around the world.’ Australia's Mitchell Starc celebrates taking the wicket of India's Murali Vija last week . Michael Clarke vowed that Phillip Hughes' spirit would run through his team . But Agnew has cited a number of flare-ups during the recent Australia-India Test series as evidence that sledging is again, regrettably, to the fore. ‘Michael Clarke said very clearly that Hughes’s memory would run through the team, and would be there in the way they would play their cricket,’ said Agnew (right). ‘Well, I haven’t seen evidence of that. ‘I really hoped that out of this tragedy might have come some good. But the players haven’t behaved any better, and I think that’s a real disappointment.’ Sledging was pervasive from both sides during Australia’s Ashes victory against England last winter. And on the evidence of Australia’s series against India, which they won 2-0 under stand-in captain Steve Smith, more of the same can be expected when the Ashes are contested again in England this summer. Phillip Hughes was killed when he was struck in the head by a ball in Sydney in November . Kohli claimed he targeted by Johnson during the third Test in Melbourne . Among a number of dubious incidents, Virat Kohli was hit by Mitchell Johnson throwing at the stumps during the third Test in Melbourne. The Indian centurion said verbal insults had come at him ‘throughout the day’ and specifically complained that Johnson had called him a ‘spoilt brat’. Kohli recalled: ‘I was really annoyed with him hitting me with the ball, and I told him that’s not on. “Try to hit the stumps next time; not my body.” You have got to send the right message across. ‘I am not there to take unnecessary words. There’s no good reason that I should respect some people when they are not respecting me.’ Indian great Sunil Gavaskar blamed his compatriots, three of whom were fined for poor behaviour. He said, reproachfully, that the Indians had ‘started it’ but it had ‘backfired’. Indian great Sunil Gavaskar says his compatriots only had themselves to blame . Former Australian star Ian Healy agreed that the bad blood was ‘out of control’. Agnew, a consistent and outspoken opponent of sledging, which he believes tarnishes the spirit of cricket, added: ‘It’s all you hear on a cricket field — “Knock his head off, knock his head off.” ‘Cricket has gone too far. It shouldn’t be posturing, abusing. Jonathan Agnew believes Australia's cricketers have failed to honour the memory of Phillip Hughes . ‘I know there has been a lot of bad blood between Australia and India for some years now, but it was an opportunity. I have that Michael Clarke speech tucked away ready to throw at the Australians. ‘If this is really how you feel, then let’s see how you play.’ Agnew recognises the need for aggressive bowling. He told the Radio Times: ‘The bouncer shouldn’t be banned. Hitting batsmen, I’m afraid, is part of the game. But it’s the histrionics, the nonsense, the prancing, the in-your-face nastiness. It’s become accepted, and actually it’s not acceptable at all. ‘The comments Michael Clarke made, I thought, summed up how people felt at the time about the way that cricket should be played. ‘The onus is on Australia to lead the way, and for others to grasp the opportunity. We owe it to Phillip Hughes.’ Meanwhile, former England one-day captain Adam Hollioake has questioned the ECB’s ability to plan properly for a World Cup. Speaking to The Times, Hollioake also criticised selectors for overlooking Ben Stokes. ‘Stokes, how does that guy not make it to a World Cup squad?’ said Hollioake. ‘He plays in my team every day of the week even if he scores 10 ducks in a row. He can bat, he can bowl. He’s a good cricketer. End of story. ‘England has the best one-day players in the world, we’ve got the best system, the best everything. ‘But we just don’t know a good player from a bad one. ‘The fixtures are mapped out years in advance. The chance is there to identify people, give them a run, and let them get used to the conditions. You should be able to plan it.’ Ben Stokes should not have been overlooked by selectors, says Adam Hollioake .","Phillip Hughes died after being hit by a ball below the line of his helmet .

"Australia spinner Xavier Doherty has described Jonathan Agnew’s comments about his side’s on-field conduct since the death of Phillip Hughes as ‘pretty touchy’. BBC cricket correspondent Agnew penned an article in the Radio Times chiding the Australians for their sledging and behaviour in a tense Test series against India.

Clarke never overtly called for an end to sledging but Agnew believes flashpoints in the India series represented a missed opportunity to improve standards. Doherty said: ‘I think sledging has been a part of cricket for a long time and as long as it’s above board and all fair it always will be. ‘The Phil Hughes memory, I’m not too sure about — it’s a pretty touchy one to cast it under that.’ Agnew responded: ‘The first thing I need to make clear is that my remarks are not critical of Michael Clarke. ‘But the verbal abuse, the posturing, the unnecessary gesturing appeared to be every bit as bad as ever (in the Australia-India series). ‘The ICC plans to bring in new, strict anti-sledging regulations in time for the World Cup which, I am assured, will have the same zero-tolerance as the recent purge on throwing. ‘But it is a shame the players have not felt prompted to act for themselves.’ Phillip Hughes was killed when he was struck in the head by a ball in Sydney in November last year .

Defending champion Stan Wawrinka could face Djokovic in a repeat of last year’s semi-final. Heather Watson was drawn against world No 67 Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria, best known for her excellent Wimbledon record. Overall it is not the worst draw for Murray, although there could have been easier potential fourth rounds than facing the hugely talented Bulgarian. When he played Federer last year he was still some way from peak physical fitness after his back operation, but he will be a different proposition this time around, should both players get that far. James Ward plays a backhand during his three-set win against John Isner at Kooyong on Thursday . Heather Watson has her eye on the ball as she claims victory over Roberta Vinci in Hobart . Having played exhibition tennis so far this season – very impressively – he will not be disappointed to get a qualifier first up and a relatively comfortable looking second round to ease his way in. Djokovic, who starts as the strong favourite for the event, can also ease his way in but his quarter has more than its quota of towering power merchants in Milos Raonic, John isner and Jerzy Janowicz. The standout first round in either draw is twice champion Victoria Azarenka against American Sloane Stephens. The two played a controversial match here two years ago when Azarenka called a suspicious injury time out when she began to struggle against the American, who lost to Heather Watson this week.","Andy Murray has been drawn against a qualifier in the first round .

"A schoolgirl who was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in Pakistan has undergone successful surgery, it was revealed today.. Doctors at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham have confirmed that Malala Yousafzai, 15, underwent cranial reconstruction and cochlear implantation procedures yesterday. A hospital spokeswoman said Malala’s medical team were 'very pleased' with her progress following the operations, which lasted for around five hours. Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai and a 3D image of her skull, which has had titanium plate fitted . Commenting on the surgery, the spokeswoman said: 'Both operations were a success and Malala is now recovering. 'Her condition is described as stable and her medical team are very pleased with the progress she has made so far. She is awake and talking to staff and members of her family.' This is a 3D model taken from Malala's skull and shows the damage inflicted by the Taliban . Malala has been receiving treatment . at the hospital since she was flown to Britain last October after being . shot in north-west Pakistan for promoting women’s rights. The Pakistani schoolgirl has since been nominated for this . year's Nobel Peace Prize. At the start of January a . frail-looking Malala hugged and waved goodbye to staff at the hospital, . where she has undergone months of life-saving surgery following the . failed assassination attempt that left her with a bullet in her brain. She continued her rehabilitation at the family's temporary West Midlands home before undergoing the major reconstructive operation. Last Wednesday, doctors at the hospital said that Malala was set to undergo surgery for what they hoped would be the last time. The teenager required the fitting of a custom-made titanium plate to repair damage to her skull, as well as a cochlear implant to help her recover hearing in her left ear. Speaking earlier this week, Dr Dave Rosser, medical director at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, said both procedures were routinely carried out at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Dr Rosser described Malala as a 'remarkable young woman' who had made great progress in her recovery. He also said she was fully aware of the threats the Taliban had made against her life. During the media briefing Dr Rosser said: ""She's not naive at all about what happened to her and the situation in terms of her high-profile. 'She's incredibly determined to continue to speak for her cause.' These images demonstrate how the plate for Malala's skull is created by using wax and shaping it to fit the contours of her skull . The red line drawn diagonally down the skull shows the journey of the bullet through the schoolgirl's head, and the plate to cover her damaged skull . Dr Rosser said it could take 'between . 15 and 18 months' for any hearing to recover in her left ear but added . that in time she would have almost normal levels of hearing, thanks to . the surgery. He also credited the surgeons who operated on Malala in Pakistan soon after she was shot with saving her life. Malala escaped death by a matter of . inches when she was shot on October 9 last year - as the bullet entered . just above her left eye and ran along her jaw - 'grazing' her brain. In a statement, the hospital said . Malala would continue her recuperation as a patient until she was well . enough to be discharged. Stefan . Edmondson, Principal Maxillofacial Prosthetist at the trust, explained . how the plate would be fitted over a hole in Malala’s skull, which has . been left by the path of the bullet. Dr Dave Rosser praised Malala's sense of humour and bravery . It was also revealed that the damaged . portion of missing skull had been implanted in Malala’s abdomen - where . it remains - in case it was needed to repair her skull at a later date. However, surgeons have now decided instead to fit the metal plate. Malala was put forward for the Nobel prize by three Norwegian MPs, . who praised her 'commitment so threatening to extremists that they tried . to kill her'. Freddy de Ruiter, from the country's . ruling Labor party, said her courage in speaking out, particularly on . the subject of a girls' right to education, made her a worthy candidate. Gorm Kjernli said on the party's website yesterday that the teenager had 'made ​​a strong impression on the whole world.' Magne Rommetveit said Malala was now . 'an important symbol in the struggle against the destructive forces that . will prevent democracy, equality and human rights.' Dr Rosser credited the surgeons who operated on Malala in Pakistan soon after she was shot for saving her life. Malala's . bravery has moved the world in the months since she was targeted by the . Taliban in Pakistan for heroically speaking out for women's rights and . freedom of access to education in the country. Dr . Rosser said Malala had already undergone surgery since her discharge . from the Birmingham Hospital at the start of the year, to repair a . facial nerve severed in the gun attack. 'The facial nerve was damaged by the course of the bullet,' he said. 'The facial nerve comes under the ear, but the surgeon was able to re-route and reconnect it. 'The surgeon has managed to do that without having to take a graft from another nerve. 'Malala . does have a weakness in her face so the left side of her face droops, . but there's a good chance she will completely recover within 18 months.' Malala Yousufzai was attacked and shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in Pakistan for campaigning for education for girls . Malala was flown to Britain for specialist treatment at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital after escaping death when a bullet 'grazed' her brain . Malala is now likely to secure permanent . residence in the UK after her father was granted a job with the . Pakistani consulate in Birmingham. The Taliban have vowed to target her again.","Medical team 'very pleased' with schoolgirl's progress following surgery .

"Novak Djokovic's chances of winning a fifth Australian Open title have been boosted by a kind draw in the opening week of the year's first grand slam. World No 1 Djokovic faces a qualifier first up and will avoid the top 10 seeds until at least the quarter-finals, where he could meet No 8 seed Milos Raonic .

Third seed Rafael Nadal has also been given few favours, with a dangerous opening round encounter with wily Russian Mikhail Youzhny, a former top-10 player, and a possible third round against Czech bogeyman Lukas Rosol, who shocked him in the second round of Wimbledon in 2012.

"Glee beauty Naya Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey just six weeks after they revealed they were tying the knot, her new father-in-law revealed today. Her marriage to Dorsey may have come as a shock to fans - but it came equally as a surprise to their parents. Calling the intimate wedding, held at the Las Ventanas al Paraiso resort in Cabo San Lucas, 'beautiful', Ryan's father, Arnold Dorsey, 59, told MailOnline: 'We knew about the wedding six weeks ago, still, it was a bit of a shock! 'I met Naya a couple of weeks ago, I was working in California and I drove up to her house. She's very tiny, real petite, but real down to earth, not with her nose stuck up in the air.' Scroll down for video . Wedding week: Naya in Los Cabos, Mexico, on Tuesday . Playful: The star appeared to share a fun moment with a friend . A beautiful spot: Naya Rivera and Ryan Dorsey tied the knot watched by just 12 guests at Las Ventanas al Paraiso in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on July 19 . The couple wed on Ryan's 31st birthday on July 19, with just 12 guests and a minister in attendance. Among the group were Naya's mother Yolanda and her stepfather - however the brunette's father, George Rivera, didn't attend. Mr Dorsey, from Charleston, West Virginia, was at the wedding with his wife, Rhonda, while his ex-wife Cheryl, Ryan's mother, was there with her husband David. He told how wedding guests, including Ryan's brother Aaron, dined on steak, shrimp, seabass and lobster as well as a selection of flatbreads - and that Naya had wanted to marry in Mexico as a birthday present to Ryan. Despite the fact Naya only split with her ex-fiance Big Sean in April, Mr Dorsey told how she had actually met Ryan four years ago and revealed how she spotted him at a nightclub. 'I knew she met him at some kind of a party, she saw him across a dance club and she went to talk to him. 'He was a playboy, he didn't want to settle down, he wanted to concentrate on his work. But they remained friends and I guess they hooked up after the engagement from Big Sean was dropped', he said. Mr Dorsey said he had not yet asked Naya about why her engagement ended, but added: 'In time if she wants to say anything about it, she can.' For now, he says the newlyweds are like 'two lovebirds', and although it was 'strictly family' at their nuptials, friends came to help them celebrate the day afterwards. According to Us Weekly, the bride tied the knot with Ryan on the same date she had planned to get married to ex Big Sean. Meet the fabulous Mrs Dorsey: Naya changed her name on Twitter on Wednesday .

Meanwhile another insider told Us Weekly that Naya used the same wedding hairstylist as Kim Kardashian, Clyde Haygood. In addition the source also claimed Naya's Monique Lhuillier dress looked 'a lot like the one Kim married Kanye in'. The television actress could be seen soaking up some rays . on Wednesday before grabbing a couple cold beverages in the vacation hotspot. Wearing a jaunty hat and sunglasses as she displayed her beach body in a clingy one-piece that showed off her legs.

He recently wrapped filming on Blood Father alongside Mel Gibson and William H Macy. Although the couple had only just started dating recently, they had been friends for four years. Their friendship turned to love after Naya's six month engagement to rapper Big Sean ended in April.

"James Ward knows that the dividends will come from the weeks he has been spending with the buddy he describes as ‘The Beast’. The friend in question is Andy Murray, his host and training partner last month in Miami, where they worked themselves into a stupor before Christmas to prepare for a new season which should see them spend more time together. That is because Ward’s steadily-climbing ranking should mean he gets into some of the tournaments Murray takes for granted, such as the Australian Open, which begins on Monday. Andy Murray's gruelling training regime is paying dividends as he prepares for the Australian Open . Murray goes into the first grand slam of the year in great shape after putting in the hard graft . The 27-year-old Londoner, now on the cusp of the world’s top 100, further illustrated that he belongs there with a 3-6, 7-6, 6-2 victory over American No 1 John Isner in the Kooyong Classic. True, it was only an exhibition but to defuse the giant’s serve when he is tuning up for the year’s first Grand Slam is a good effort all the same, and an early payback for the toiling in Florida. ‘Andy is a beast, everyone knows that, and he might disagree but I kept up with him, we were pushing each other,’ said Ward, who spent two-and-a-half weeks as Murray’s house guest, before hooking up with him again in the Middle East after Christmas. ‘It was hard but you don’t have doubts because you know you have done the work with one of the best in the world.’ Ward outlined the kind of regime they endured in a place where most go for hedonistic pleasure, not brutal training punishment. James Ward joined Murray in Miami last month to prepare for the new season . ‘Every other day we would play for about three-and-a-half hours, like in a Grand Slam. On the other days it would be more like two hours on court and then every day it’s up to two hours in the gym.’ There would also be sessions on the beach, no recliners necessary. ‘We did sand work, mainly short repeated sprints when you’d compete against each other. At the end of most days you are dead... in bed by 10 o’clock. ‘I was looked after really well by his team. I am a lot stronger and moving better than before.’ This is the sort of regime that sees Murray turn up every year in Australia in prime shape, and his reversion to sand training looks to be a change under his new structure working full-time with trainer Matt Little. Murray has been gearing up for the Australian Open under the watchful eye of coach Amelie Mauresmo . Murray’s future father-in-law, the experienced coach Nigel Sears, revealed earlier this month that his resting heart beat was a phenomenally low 37 beats per minute. The former Wimbledon champion has been working on his already lightning foot-speed, spending slightly more time on the court and less in the gym. He and Ward have become close since becoming a regular duo in the British Davis Cup team and although they have largely inhabited different tennis worlds Murray has taken a close interest in his rise up the rankings. ‘Andy is always the first to say well done when I’ve had a decent win,’ said Ward. ‘I was flagging a bit at the end of last season and he helped keep me going.’ They have a shared interest in Arsenal, for whom Ward, who grew up in Euston, dreamed of playing as a child. While Britain’s No 2 has an unusual sports clothing deal with men’s outfitter Ted Baker, Murray has a more lucrative tie-in with Under Armour. ‘The only bad thing about him is that he is sharing his clothing supplier with Tottenham,’ added Ward. Ward has made a steady rise up the rankings and is on the cusp of the world's top 100 . British youngsters Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady moved to within one match of qualifying for the main draw of a Grand Slam for the first time when they made the third round of the Australian Open qualifying event. Edmund, the 20-year-old from Yorkshire, came back to beat American left-hander Austin Krajicek 4-6, 7-6, 6-2 and now faces a winnable clash with world No 323 Dane Propoggia of Australia. Broady fought out a fine 7-6, 6-7, 6-4 win over another American, 18-year-old Jared Donaldson, a superb ball-striker reckoned to be one of the sport’s hottest prospects. It was a match of supremely high quality for the qualifying event on the most remote outside court, and his reward is to meet American veteran Michael Russell. Heather Watson’s encouraging form continued when she made her second semi-final on the main WTA Tour by defeating Italy’s Roberta Vinci 7-6, 6-2 in the Hobart International.","James Ward joined Andy Murray in Miami to prepare for new season .

"Andy Murray has unveiled his new personal logo, which he will display for the first time at the Australian Open next week. The design will feature on Murray's on-court bag and training T-shirts in Melbourne. The world No 6 hired Aesop Agency to come up with the logo, which combines his initials with the number 77. Andy Murray's new logo incorporates his initials AM and the number 77 - a reference to his Wimbledon title . The logo will make its first appearance at the Australian Open, which starts next week . Roger Federer - Like Murray, the tennis star also has his own logo (RF). Gareth Bale - In 2013 Bale successfully applied for intellectual property rights to his '11 of hearts' trademark celebration. Cristiano Ronaldo - The Ballon d'or winner has brought out and entire fashion range under his CR7 logo. Murray became the first British man in 77 years to win the Wimbledon singles title in 2013, and it is the name of the management company he set up following his second grand slam victory. The launch of the logo follows Murray's switch of clothing sponsor from adidas to Under Armour. Dan Calderwood, design director at Aesop, said: 'We wanted to create a modern mark that captures Andy's energy and spirit whilst subtly referencing his affinity with the number 77. 'It's simple and striking, with heraldic cues that echo his dominance on the court.' Roger Federer already has his own logo, pictured here on his T-Shirt while he trains . Murray in training for the Australian Open while coach Amelie Mauresmo watches on . Murray follows in the footsteps of a number of players, most famously Roger Federer, whose RF logo is ubiquitous at tennis events.

"Pablo Zabaleta reckons Sergio Aguero can become Manchester City's first Ballon d'Or winner - but only if he can stay injury free. The Argentina striker hit 19 goals in 20 games this season before suffering a knee ligament injury in December - the latest in a long line of setbacks.

"Hosts Australia swept into the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup in some style on Tuesday with a 4-0 hammering of Oman at Stadium Australia that ensured South Korea would go through from Group A with them. Midfielder Matt McKay and striker Robbie Kruse struck inside three minutes just before the half-hour mark, Mark Milligan converted a penalty on the stroke of half time and striker Tomi Juric added the fourth in a one-sided second half. Having beaten Kuwait 4-1 to open their campaign last Friday, the Socceroos have a healthy advantage in goals scored over the South Koreans and will just need a draw to win the group when the teams meet in Brisbane on Saturday. The Australian team celebrate with Matt McKay after he scored to put Australia 1-0 up against Oman . McKay (second left) heads past Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al-Habsi (right) to open the scoring in Sydney . A shot from behind the goal shows McKay heading home, to set Australia on their way on Tuesday night . Australia: Ryan; Franjic, Sainsbury, Spiranovic, Davidson; Milligan, McKay, Luongo (Bresciano 51), Leckie (Oar 77), Cahill (Juric 51); Kruse . Subs not used: Langerak, Behich, Troisi, Burns, Galekovic, Antonis, Wilkinson . Goals: McKay 27, Kruse 30, Milligan 45+3, Juric 70 . Oman: Al-Habsi; Al Mukhaini, Al-Owaisi, Al-Musalami, Al-Busaidi (Amer Said 46); Al Khaldi, Mubarak, Al-Farsi; Saleh (Ali Salim 88), Al Hosni (Al Jabri 46), Al-Maqbali . Subs not used: Nasr Al Shimli, Al Siyabi, Qasim Saeed, Yaqoob Abdulkraim, Hassan Mudhafar, Al Kasbi, Ahmed Salim, Al Breiki, Al Razaiqi . More than that, though, Australia showed enough against a team that has caused them problems in the past to suggest their ambitions should not be confined to reaching the last eight for the third straight tournament. midfielder Massimo Luongo, man of the match against the Kuwaitis, played only 50 minutes but contributed to the first two goals and Kruse could have had a hat-trick on another night. Oman had the first shot on target in the third minute, Raed Saleh's raking half volley from outside the penalty box drawing an athletic save from Mat Ryan and confirming the goalkeeper's strong form. That proved to be pretty much Oman's only attacking contribution to the match and they will now go home with Kuwait after their final group game in Newcastle on Saturday.

Tim Cahill posted this selfie on board the Australian team coach after securing their place in the next round . After 27 minutes, the Australian pressure finally told when Luongo swung in a cross from the left which Trent Sainsbury headed down towards goal, leaving McKay the simplest of finishes. Three minutes later, Luongo was again the provider with Kruse taking his through ball on the hip before firing it into the net through the legs of Ali Al-Habsi. Australia had to wait until stoppage time to go three up when Tim Cahill was hauled down trying to reach Kruse's cross and Milligan, who replaced the injured Mile Jedinak in midfield and as penalty-taker, stepped up to convert from the spot. Melbourne Victory's Mark Milligan scored from the spot to make it 3-0 to Australia against Oman .

Striker Juric, who replaced Cahill after 50 minutes, added the fourth after 70 minutes, turning winger Mathew Leckie's beautifully weighted cross into the net at the far post.

"Everton boss Roberto Martinez is busy looking for a new goalkeeper but has played down talk linking him with Cardiff's David Marshall - and emphasised that neither Samuel Eto'o nor Seamus Coleman are about to leave Goodison Park. Martinez has wanted to bring in a shot-stopper since first-choice Tim Howard picked up a calf injury on Boxing Day that is set to rule him out until well into February. Reports have suggested the manager is interested in Marshall, but when asked on Monday if there was anything in the stories about the Scotland international - who missed Cardiff's match at the weekend due to an injury of his own - potentially joining Everton, Martinez said: 'No - nothing at all.' Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall has been linked with a move to Roberto Martinez's Everton . Despite the reports, Martinez has claimed that Marshall (pictured) is not on Everton's radar . The Spaniard did, however, confirm he had made some enquiries about goalkeepers this month, adding: 'It is something we have done for a while now, but nothing has been conclusive or done in a way that we can announce any names. 'I'm not interested in bringing in a short-term goalkeeper - we'll look at the options, but if we bring in anyone, it has to be someone who can stay with us for the long term. 'We are going to explore that avenue and if we find the right personality, we'll act on it.' With regard to potential outgoings from Everton in the current transfer window, there has been speculation that striker Eto'o could move to Italian side Sampdoria and full-back Coleman make a switch to Manchester United. Speaking at his press conference to preview Tuesday's FA Cup third-round replay at West Ham, Martinez also dismissed those suggestions, insisting there would be no 'big sales' made by the Merseysiders this month. Martinez has said that there is 'nothing at all' in the Marshall rumours, while stating that Seamus Coleman and Samuel Eto'o will both stay at the club beyond the January transfer window . Coleman (right) has been linked with a move to Manchester United, but Martinez says there will be no big exits . On Eto'o, Martinez said: 'I know there has been a lot of speculation, but we haven't been contacted - we have had no conversations about that issue at all. 'At the moment Samuel is working really well and is always a really strong influence in the day-to-day work, and there is nothing to comment on really.' And when asked about there being any truth in the Coleman reports, Martinez said: 'No. 'I have said before that we are in a position where all that matters is to get good momentum in the league and be as strong as we can in the cups. 'We are not entertaining that speculation of big sales. We are not going to sell our big assets in the window, so I think all those stories and admiration from the outside are just a waste of time.' Everton have struggled for 'good momentum' in recent weeks - indeed, prior to the original cup tie against West Ham last Tuesday they had lost four games in a row and won only one in nine in all competitions. It has been reported that Samuel Eto'o (left) could be set for a move to Serie A side Sampdoria in January . Martinez has played down reports of Coleman (left) moving to Louis van Gaal's Manchester United . The rot has been stopped with 1-1 draws in that match and then against Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday; performances Martinez believes have provided a platform from which his side can now build for a decent second half of the season. Although he accepts questions have been asked of his players, the 41-year-old has stressed he has never doubted them himself. And that includes striker Romelu Lukaku, the £28million club record summer signing who has bounced back from starting two successive games on the bench to put in eye-catching displays as part of the first XI against the Hammers and City. Lukaku's last-gasp equaliser against the London outfit last week means he has scored a goal in each of his last four encounters with West Ham. There were doubts over Romelu Lukaku, but he proved his worth with two eye-catching displays for Everton . Lukaku scored a last-gasp equaliser against West Ham to nick a draw for Everton in the FA Cup last Tuesday . Martinez will be hoping for more of the same on Tuesday, and said of the Belgium international: 'Romelu is now performing at a very good level, but he has always showed real desire to help the team and strong responsibility. 'I have always known that Romelu, fully fit, is in my eyes one of the best strikers in world football. 'Now he is in the right place and it has been very pleasing to see him enjoying his football and being so effective in the last two games.' Everton will on Tuesday be without the same seven players who missed the City contest - Howard, Sylvain Distin (groin), Tony Hibbert (unspecified), Leon Osman (foot), Darron Gibson, Steven Pienaar (both knee) and James McCarthy (hamstring). Martinez has confirmed he intends to include 22-year-old forward Conor McAleny in the squad to face West Ham.","Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard picked up an injury on Boxing Day .

"Miles away from the history that is being made in London, a former Olympian is living an entirely different life – one of service and devotion to God. Back then, she was Kirstin Holum, a promising teenage speedskater making her Olympic debut at the 1998 Nagano games. Now 32, she's Sr Catherine Mary, in the Franciscan Sisters of the Renewal, driven by a calling that she first began to receive in Nagano. Rising star: Kirstin Holum looked like a promising athlete when she competed in the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics as a 17-year-old . That's where she realised that the life of an Olympic champion may not be for her. Sr Catherine told ABCNews.com:  'I couldn't see myself continuing all through my 20s and 30s like other athletes.' She added: 'I remember it vividly, one day practicing: I said [to my mother], 'I just want to be in a play or a musical in school rather than this.' I had a feeling there was something else for me.' In a December 1997 interview with the Associated Press, Holum - who was 17 at the time - said she was ready to quit speedskating to pursue a career as an artist. Now and then: Holum, now Sr Catherine Mary, left, said she couldn't see herself continuing speedskating into her 20s and 30s. At right, she's pictured in the 1998 Olympics at 17 years old . That same year, she broke her own American record for the 3,000 meters three times, but was looking to leave it all behind. Holum said at the time: ‘There's so much more out there than speedskating. It's too consuming. I don't know what it's like not to skate. I want to get on with [my life].' Several months later, Holum competed in her first and only Olympic games in Nagano, where she came in 6th place in the 3,000m and 7th place in the 5,000m. Her mother and coach was Dianne Holum, who has four Olympic medals under her belt - including a gold she won in the 1972 Sapporo games. Devotion: Looking back at her life, Sr Catherine says she wouldn't change a thing . Dianne Holum said that when her daughter first told her that she was looking to hang up her skates, she was relieved. 'We were real close and I always knew,' said her mother. 'She was getting more and more focused on her faith and I was happy for that.' Looking back at her life now, Sr Catherine says she wouldn’t change anything. In a 2010 interview with CHN Online, she said: 'I don’t miss any of those things, because life is so rich and so full. 'Without all of the technology, we have more time for one another as sisters and also more time to serve God’s people. Life is so much simpler that way.'","Kirstin Holum had a promising career ahead of her after finishing 6th and 7th in events at the Nagano Olympics in 1998 .

"Goals either side of half time from Oscar and Diego Costa saw Chelsea return to winning ways in the Premier League as they beat Newcastle at Stamford Bridge. Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham runs through how the players performed. CHELSEA (4-2-3-1) Petr Cech - 7 . The goalkeeper was to thank for keeping Chelsea from going behind in the first half, despite making only his second league start. Branislav Ivanovic - 6.5 . Played a great ball to pick out Oscar at the back post, after receiving a corner kick from Willian, to put Chelsea ahead. Right back Branislav Ivanovic stretches to get a touch on the ball as Yoan Gouffran looks on . Kurt Zouma - 6 . Put in a competent display in his first Premier League start, but Chelsea lacked the usual defensive assuredness with Cahill alongside Terry. John Terry - 5 . Not his usual commanding self, easily between twice in the first half, by Cabella and Sissoko, but Cech saved him the first time and the post the next. Cesar Azpilicueta - 6 . His afternoon was ended prematurely when he came off with an injury in the first half and left little mark on the game. Chelsea captain John Terry heads clear as Ayoze Perez puts pressure on Kurt Zouma . Nemanja Matic - 6 . A few stray passes, when Matic is usually so certain to find his man, but was strong and solid in the middle of the park. Cesc Fabregas - 6 . Biggest shock of the day was that he did not get an assist, but when Chelsea finally started to dominate in the second half he kept their midfield ticking along. Willian - 6.5 . Acted fast to play a quick corner to Ivanovic which resulted in Chelsea's first goal and sent a free kick heading into the top right corner only to be saved. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas battles for possession with Newcastle's Perez . Oscar - 7.5 . Sent Chelsea ahead with a calm finish at the back post then played an exquisite back-heel flick to set up Costa for their second. Eden Hazard - 6.5 . Quiet in the first half, not his usual dominating form on the ball, but produced a lovely clipped ball for Oscar to skilfully put in Costa's path for the second goal. Diego Costa - 6.5 . Scored the goal which put the game beyond doubt for Chelsea in an afternoon that Newcastle could've got something from. Oscar celebrates after giving Chelsea the lead just before half time at Stamford Bridge . SUBSTITUTES . Filipe Luis - 6 . Put in a solid performance down the left flank after coming on to replace the injured Azpilicueta. Ramires . Came on for Oscar to provide a bit more stability to the midfield with the game virtually out of reach for Newcastle. Remy . Got some stick from Newcastle fans, where he used to play, but provided some fresh legs in the final moments. Diego Costa looks to the heavens in celebration after doubling Chelsea's lead 15 minutes into the second half . NEWCASTLE (4-3-3) Tim Krul - 6 . Little that Krul could do about Chelsea's opener but was solid in his first return since November, after seven weeks out with an ankle injury. Daryl Janmaat - 6 . Sprightly at right-back but managed to nullify Hazard to a certain extent, which is no mean feat. Fabricio Coloccini - 6 . Excellent sliding clearance to stop Diego Costa adding a third after the Chelsea striker had beaten four of his team-mates. Tim Krul and Daryl Janmaat can do can do nothing to stop Oscar opening the scoring as the ball squeezes in . Mike Williamson - 6 . Diego Costa proved too much of a handful for the centre-back in the end who was well organised throughout. Paul Dummett - 6 . Received a yellow card for a late challenge on Willian, but overall coped well with the Brazilian winger. Moussa Sissoko - 6.5 . Rattled the right post after leaving Terry for dead to almost open the scoring for Newcastle. Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko is beaten in the by Terry, and takes a whack in the back . Jack Colback - 6 . Did well breaking up Chelsea's midfield rhythm with interceptions and the odd niggling foul. Vernon Anita - 6 . Did a similar job to Colback, disrupting Chelsea's forward play which has been so fluid and devastating this season. Remy Cabella - 7 . Constantly causing Chelsea's defence problems by popping up in spaces between them and often beating two or three with his skill. Denied by a great diving save from Cech. Remy Cabella manages to get a shot away, but fails to score, as Terry bears down on the Frenchman . Ayoze Perez - 5.5 . While Cabella was drawing Chelse's defenders all over the pitch, Perez failed to capitalise on the spaces and proved little threat. Yoan Gouffran - 6 . Hit a bullet of a free kick that was well-saved by Cech, but failed to match impact up front of Cabella who needed an ally to unlock Chelsea. SUBSTITUTES . Sammy Ameobi - 6 . Almost caught out Cech with a cross that was mis-hit but heading on target soon after coming on. Emmanuel Riviere . Not long enough to make an impression on the game after coming on in the final five minutes. Perez goes in for a strong challenge on Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic .","Brazilian midfielder Oscar opened the scoring just before half time .

"Roma president James Pallotta has revealed that he has no intention of selling star midfielder Kevin Strootman, but admits the club would have to listen to 'huge' offers. Manchester United have been linked with a £32million for Strootman, who has been rumoured to a move away from Roma despite signing a five-year deal in 2013. Pallotta told Bleacher Report: 'I do get annoyed. I think the papers have finally given up on the Strootman thing, because Kevin's come out and addressed it, saying he likes it in Italy and he has a five-year contract. And by the way, I wasn't going to sell him anyway!' Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman is not for sale, according to club president James Pallotta . Strootman in action for Roma against Udinese last week, has been linked with the Red Devils . 'My view is that I don't want Kevin to go, for example, but if someone offers a huge amount, you at least have to listen to them. 'You're running a team, so you have to look at what's best for everyone, not just one individual. That's the way the world works.'

"Liverpool are set to play two matches in Australia as part of this summer’s lucrative pre-season tour. The Reds will return Down Under after the huge success of their first visit two years ago when they played in front of 95,000 supporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. This time Adelaide and Brisbane are expected to be the destinations for Brendan Rodgers’ squad as they step up their preparations for the 2015/16 campaign. Liverpool visited Australia two years ago and played in front of 95,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground .

Then-Liverpool striker Luis Suarez pictured after the match between the Reds and Melbourne Victory . Liverpool are set to play two matches in Australia as part of this summer’s lucrative pre-season tour . Details have yet to be finalised but it’s likely to be a four-game, fortnight-long tour starting in July with Liverpool stopping off in Asia both en route to Australia and on the return journey. Indonesia and China are the leading contenders to also host friendly fixtures. A return to Indonesia was always on the cards with their national airline Garuda one of Liverpool’s key commercial partners. A crowd of 82,000 watched the Reds beat an Indonesia XI in Jakarta in July 2013. The alternative option to Indonesia is playing in the Malaysian city of Kuala Lumpur. The Reds last visited China in 2011 when 35,000 saw Kenny Dalglish’s side beat Guandgdong Sunray Cave 4-3 in Guangzhou. This time Liverpool are expected to visit the city of Macau – 40 miles west of Hong Kong – instead. Charlie Adam, now of Stoke City, pictured playing for Liverpool in China in July 2011 during pre-season . Andy Carroll (left) and Conor Coady (right) of Liverpool celebrate scoring a goal during a pre-season friendly . Sources in Australia expect the matches Down Under to be officially announced early next month once contracts have been exchanged. Anfield officials have been in talks with various cities about staging matches but it appears that Sydney has lost out to Adelaide and Brisbane. The game in South Australia would be played at the Adelaide Oval which is best known as a historic cricket venue. It boasts a capacity of 53,000 and has also hosted international rugby and football previously. Brendan Rodgers' side are set to play two  games in Australia this summer just as they did two years ago . Last summer A-League outfit Adelaide United played La Liga side Malaga there in front of 23,000 and promoters know Liverpool would represent a much bigger draw. The Reds would be the first Premier League club to visit the state of South Australia since Sheffield United in 1994. Liverpool are set to line up against either Adelaide United or a A-League All Stars XI. Rodgers’ men will also head for the east coast of Australia to play in Brisbane, Queensland. State government officials have been heavily involved in negotiations to secure Liverpool’s visit. The venue is likely to be the 52,500-capacity Suncorp Stadium which is home to Brisbane Roar FC. Celtic and Everton have both played friendly matches there in the past six years. Liverpool toured America last summer - playing matches in Boston, Chicago, New York, Charlotte and Miami .

"Liverpool have revealed they expect their income to surge by £25m a year when their expanded main stand opens next year. Around £20m of that cash will come from 8,500 extra seats, including 4,500 corporate seats. The club also hope to make £5m a year from getting a naming rights sponsor for the stand - while keeping the name Anfield for the ground as a whole. Extra income could also follow because the new Anfield will be eligible and fit to stage major European club finals. The details are revealed in an interview with Liverpool’s chief executive Ian Ayre in the new edition of FC Business magazine.  Liverpool desperately need extra match-day income to help them catch up with major rivals already housed in much bigger stadiums, not least Manchester United and Arsenal. Stadium expansion work began in December on the redevelopment of the Main Stand at Anfield . By the start of the 2016-17 season it is expected that the stadium redevelopment will be completed . 45,000 - Anfield's current capacity . 54,000 - Capacity after initial expansion . 58,800 - Potential capacity after second phase . 8,500 - Phase one to extend the Main Stand . 4,500 - Phase two to extend Anfield Road end . £75m - cost of extension by 2016/17 season . £260m - cost of overall regeneration in Anfield . Anfield’s current capacity is just shy of 45,500 and the first phase of expansion - with building work just underway - will take that to 54,000 by the start of the 2016-17 season. A second phase could see the Anfield Road Stand expanded later by a further 4,800 seats. The expansion will cost £100m but the club will reap the benefits in the medium term. Ayre insists that adding a sizable amount of higher-priced corporate seats, often known as ‘prawn sandwich’ places, is key to the scheme’s viability. ‘Corporate hospitality revenues are essential,’ Ayre says. ‘If we had increased capacity by 8,500 general admission seats only, it would have taken a ridiculous time to pay back the investment, meaning revenues into the team would have been affected. ‘But the large corporate increase means we will pay the debt back quickly and not be saddled with debt, while quickly increasing revenues into the playing squad. Liverpool's new Main Stand will be made up of three tiers and will include premium seating for Reds fans . The Main Stand will have two new tiers added to take the capacity to over 53,000 by start of 2016-17 season . ‘The club wants the return on investment as quickly as makes sense. Liverpool has to be sustainable. We have formulated a model that gives a fast return of the capital expenditure over five to six years, but that will also allow the club to enjoy some benefits from the expansion even before that time. Beyond the five or six years, we will of course really see more revenues on the bottom line.’ Liverpool’s American owners Fenway Sports Group, who also own US baseball team the Boston Red Sox and successfully modernised their Fenway Park Stadium, are effectively lending Liverpool the stadium expansion money in the form of an interest-free loan, bypassing the need to meet crippling bank charges. The £5m-a-year potential income in naming rights is an estimate floated by experts in that field. Ayre says: ‘The commercial department is in talks with various people. We didn’t think that looking for a naming rights deal on a stadium as iconic as Anfield made sense, but there are real value and benefits to be had around a naming rights deal on the new stand. There was plenty of building activity from workers on the opening day of the Anfield Main Stand redevelopment . ‘It is not just a question of how much a deal is worth, but more about which deal would allow the club and partner to enjoy the most benefit.’ Not only will the club benefit enormously from the expansion, so will the wider area, with local regeneration directly creating 360 new long-term jobs according to economists. The numbers exclude construction and supply chain jobs, which, if included would see 770 jobs created. The redevelopment will also allow Liverpool to host international fixtures and European finals in the future. UEFA insist upon at least a 50,000-capacity stadium, corporate accommodation and a minimum standard for players and match officials’ changing rooms - which will all be passed once the first phase has been completed.","Expansion of main Anfield stand is set to be completed in time for 2016-17 .

"Liverpool are anxiously monitoring Steven Gerrard’s fitness amid fears that he could miss the Capital One Cup semi-final showdown with Chelsea. The 34-year-old was substituted at half-time during Saturday’s 1-0 win over Sunderland to protect a tight hamstring. He has subsequently received treatment at Liverpool’s Melwood training base but his involvement in the weekend trip to Aston Villa is in doubt. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard celebrates with goalscorer Lazar Markovic at Sunderland on Saturday . The 34-year-old had to be replaced at half-time at Sunderland last Saturday with a tight hamstring . With the first leg of the Capital One Cup tie played at Anfield 72 hours later, should Gerrard fail to appear at Villa Park, there would then be a question mark over whether he would be ready to face Jose Mourinho’s men. Gerrard brings the curtain down on his glittering Anfield career at the end of the season and the perfect send-off would be to win a trophy before he joins LA Galaxy. The Capital One Cup perhaps offers the best chance to fulfil that dream. No firm decisions will be made until later in the week and, until then, Gerrard will continue to work closely with Liverpool’s medical staff to maximise his chances of being involved in the match with Chelsea. England forward Daniel Sturridge poses for a photo with Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard . Daniel Sturridge is also unlikely to play in either leg of the semi-final. The striker has returned to training at Melwood following extensive treatment in the USA but the England international, who has not played since August 31 last year, has yet to join in a full training session. Liverpool — preparing to open contract talks with Martin Skrtel, who has 18 months left on his deal — are desperate to bring Sturridge’s goal threat back into their team but, at the same time, they are also aware of the need to be patient. It is looking certain, meanwhile, that Liverpool will return to Australia in the summer for their pre-season tour, with the likelihood being that they will play games in Brisbane and Adelaide. A two-week tour of the Southern Hemisphere could also include a fixture in Macau and one in Indonesia. When they played in Australia two years ago, a crowd of 95,000 saw them beat Melbourne Victory 2-0 in the MCG.

"Former Bundesliga champions Werder Bremen are ready to sign World Cup top scoring striker Miroslav Klose if the opportunity arises, the club said on Wednesday. The Lazio player, who won the World Cup with Germany last year and is the tournament's all-time top scorer, played at Werder from 2004-7 scoring 53 goals in 89 matches, before joining Bayern Munich and then moving to Italy in 2011. 'It would be a dream. If everything fits why would we ever say no, that is if Klose is still fit and he also has the will to come to Bremen,' Werder coach Viktor Skripnik told reporters in Turkey when asked about it.

'Should Klose be available on the market it is something that we will look into,' Werder sports director Thomas Eichin told Sport Bild magazine. 'He has a great Werder past and has a great name in Bremen.'

"Cristiano Ronaldo insists he has no regrets about playing in the World Cup despite carrying an injury and refuses to use it as an excuse for his below-par performances in Brazil. Portugal were eliminated at the first hurdle after finishing third in a group containing eventual winners Germany, the United States and Ghana. Ronaldo, who was crowned the best player in the world for a third time at Monday's Ballon d'Or gala in Zurich, only managed to score once in three World Cup games - during Portugal's only win against Ghana. Cristiano Ronaldo, pictured at Real Madrid training on Wednesday, has no regrets about playing at the World Cup despite carrying an injury into the tournament in Brazil . Ronaldo refuses to blame his fitness concerns for his below-par performances . There were fears the 29-year-old would miss the tournament all together after struggling with a knee injury towards the end of the season with Real Madrid. But Ronaldo played through the pain to represent his country last summer and the former Manchester United man revealed he would do it all over again. 'I've no regrets about what I did, as things happen for a reason. After winning the Champions League, for which I was injured - I had to sit out training for two weeks ahead of the final because of pains – I headed off to the World Cup,' Ronaldo told FIFA's official website.

'However, I like to face up to things directly. First of all, I don't want to use the fact I was injured as an excuse but it's true that I wasn't 100 per cent, as many people knew, and some didn't want to know but, as I said, I'm not making excuses.

"Jamie Murray is in line for a recall to the British Davis Cup team to partner his brother Andy when they take on the USA in the biggest team match the country has hosted for decades. The 28-year-old doubles specialist, who has already won a title on the ATP Tour this season, is in pole position to make his first appearance since 2011 when Glasgow hosts the World Group first round tie in early March. While talking up the prospects of pitting the Murrays against the world champion Bryan brothers, GB Captain Leon Smith also ruled out any prospect of Aljaz Bedene being selected on Tuesday, regardless of his current citizenship application. Brothers Andy (left) and Jamie (right) Murray share a joke while playing together in Glasgow five years ago . The two brothers also played together during the London Olympics in 2012 . The 25-year-old Slovenian, who reached the final of the ATP event in Chennai at the weekend, wants to represent his adopted country and hopes that a nationality switch is imminent. But Smith made it clear on Tuesday that he is set on having Londoner James Ward as his back up singles player, and is more concerned with who will make up his doubles team for what could well be the pivotal rubber of the tie. He has five realistic options for the doubles team: the Murray brothers, Davis Cup stalwart Colin Fleming, former Wimbledon champion Jonny Marray and recent British number one Dom Inglot. Tellingly, though, he pointed to Jamie's decent record against the Bryans when discussing his thoughts for Britain's opening tie in the elite sixteen-team knockout. Murray Snr (left) and John Peers (right) celebrate winning the Brisbane International earlier this month . 'It's very difficult for anyone to play three matches in three days at this level, but without disrespecting anyone the strongest doubles team is Andy and somebody else,' said Smith, in attendance at the Australian Open. 'I've got some very good options but I'd say Jamie has been the strongest player over the last six months, and he has done well in recent matches against the Bryans (two wins alongside Australian John Peers in their last four meetings).' He acknowledged that Fleming has played well in the Davis Cup previously, but he is sitting out at the Australian Open after the birth of his first child and is likely to be short of matches. Smith witnessed wins in the qualifying event for both Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady, an event that Ward does not need to play in because his ranking of 102 has secured a place in the main draw. Murray Jnr trains with a heart monitor around his chest ahead of the Australian Open in Melbourne . 'Wardy has always fought 100 per cent for Britain in the Davis Cup and is improving all the time. 'Aljaz is a good guy but he's ranked lower than James and I don't see him as an issue for me to consider at the moment.' Bedene is ranked 116 but highly rated, and he believes he could soon be a British citizen. However, even if he comes to represent GB as an individual he would have to launch an appeal process to overcome rules hindering him from playing in major team competitions. One of Broady, 21, or Edmund, 20, are likely to be the reserve player at the Davis Cup. Broady defeated Uzbek Farrukh Dustov 6-4 6-3 in the qualifying first round while Edmund overcame France's Tristan Lamasine 6-4 6-2. Smith said that he would like to have been able to consider former British number two Dan Evans, who has not played since the summer after knee problems. He revealed that Evans is likely to make his comeback at a Futures level event starting in Sheffield this weekend.","The Two Murray brothers are in line to play alongside one another for Great Britain when the Davis Cup gets underway in early March .

Watched by Fed Cup captain Judy Murray, Broady recovered from an early break of serve in the opening set to lead 3-2, but then lost her serve for a second time in the seventh game and Radwanska served out for the set with ease.

Poland's Urszula Radwanska comfortably saw off Broady 6-4, 6-3  on Thursday . A double fault from Broady gifted Radwanksa an early break in the second set and the world number 149 saved two break points in the eighth game to move within sight of victory. That seemed to break Broady's spirit and the 24-year-old committed four unforced errors in the next game - including two double faults - to hand her opponent a second break and the match. Konta also lost in straights to American Ann Tatishvili in a match featuring eight breaks of serve and complaints from both players about the standard of officiating. Broady waits to play a forehand during the qualifying loss against Radwanska . The players swapped breaks of serve in the first two games of the match and Konta saved a total of five break points before gifting Tatishvili a 5-4 lead with a double fault.

On the second occasion the world number 147 served three double faults and told umpire Jose Sierra 'We need to change you' after a crucial overrule. Another debatable line call prompted Konta to tell Sierra 'You're shocking, you know that?' as she lost her serve once more in the 11th game and Tatishvili gratefully grabbed her chance to secure a 6-4 7-5 win.

"Paul Murray has urged Rangers fans to take destiny into their own hands by throwing their financial muscle behind one of two fan ownership schemes. Murray, who together with Dave King and John Gilligan, is seeking a place on the Ibrox board at a forthcoming Extraordinary General Meeting, has taken out life membership of both the Rangers Supporters Trust and Rangers First. With the Trust enjoying contributions from over 3,000 members and Rangers First members now numbering 4200, the prospect of fans holding the balance of power in determining boardroom change is growing by the day. Former director Paul Murray has asked supporters to take their own control of Rangers' destiny . Murray (right) has taken out lifetime membership with both the Rangers Supporters Trust and Rangers First . And, with the current incumbents fighting for survival at the EGM, the former Ibrox director is imploring each disgruntled supporter to vote with their pocket by joining the growing number seeking meaningful change via the mass purchase of shares. A statement on behalf of Murray read: ‘I have today taken out life membership of both the Rangers Supporters Trust and Rangers First. Whilst I would like to make special mention of the RST, who have supported our cause tirelessly over the last few years, I wish to make it known that I fully support these two groups in their desire to help safeguard the future of our club. ‘Along with many of the people who have been working behind the scenes to ensure Rangers can again function fully, both on and off the pitch, I believe the supporters should be able to participate significantly in the club’s rehabilitation. ‘Dave King, John Gilligan and I are committed to introducing meaningful fan ownership and representation at the club and that is one of the reasons I have pledged my support to both groups. ‘RST and Rangers First have bought not insignificant amounts of shares and must be recognised by those of us who are striving to remove the current Directors and begin the process of repairing the considerable damage caused by a constantly changing Boardroom. The future of the Scottish giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems . Rangers players applaud the fans after their match with Hearts was abandoned at the weekend . ‘The Club and not the needs of individuals must be put back to the top of the priority list and the supporters can help us achieve that goal. Rangers First and RST will always have the best interests of their club at heart and they deserve as much support as we can give. ‘I would urge as many of this club’s fans to sign up to either one or both if possible. The fans can play a hugely significant part in forcing change through votes. ‘They are the most loyal supporters any club could wish for but have been disregarded by a succession of directors in recent years, and I for one recognise their contribution in the struggle to end the disgrace and level of mismanagement within Ibrox. ‘There is now a demand for a General Meeting and our fans can make a difference in that process, which hopefully will bring about the changes necessary. We have seen what happens when Directors with no feel, no understanding and no real concern for Rangers are in control.’ No date has yet been set for the EGM which ordinarily must be called within 42 days. The board has stated it plans to resist the requisition on the grounds that King isn’t fit to be a director due to his convictions for contravening South African income tax law. Rangers have been sent into further disarray following the resignation of caretaker boss Kenny McDowall . Murray, though, says the wider fan-base must be prepared to stand strong in the face of a war of words that’s only going to intensify. ‘In the lead up to the General Meeting the usual suspects will attempt to undermine our cause because they realise their days could be numbered,’ the statement went on. ‘The truth is that for the first time in years there is a group of people capable of rebuilding and repairing our club and malicious speculation will not deflect us. ‘Rangers have to re-engage with Scottish football and take our place again at the top table. ‘We need to be financially stable again and accept our responsibilities to the game in general. Change will come and we can all emerge from a black period in this fantastic club’s history.’","Paul Murray has called for supporters to join fan ownership schemes .

"They were undoubtedly the main attraction. Two rays of South American sunshine to pierce the gloom of a freezing January afternoon in Manchester, two dashes of spice sprinkled on the already-tasty dish of Manchester City versus Arsenal. In the blue corner, Sergio Aguero of Argentina. Back in business, fit again and firing after injury and hotly-fancied to add to his 19 goal tally for the season so far. In the red corner (well yellow and blue), Alexis Sanchez of Chile. A £30m man who has paid back his hefty transfer fee already; exceeding even the loftiest of pre-season expectations with his 18 goals, copious assists and a seldom-found and whole-hearted desire to play in EVERY single game. Alexis Sanchez hurdles the challenge of Martin Demichelis during his bravura first-half performance . The sight of Sanchez surrounded by City players became a familiar one as he controlled the first-half . City's Sergio Aguero, by contrast, was struggling to impose himself on the game . Aguero attempts to close down Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin as City seek a route back into proceedings . Aguero and Sanchez were worth the admission money alone at the Etihad Stadium - they belong to that magical category of players who make impressionable young fans fall in love with the game. But in the first-half just one of the pair made any impression. The opening 45 minutes was a collector's item in itself - a modern Arsenal team travelling away to one of the big teams and dominating proceedings. Goalkeeper David Ospina was redundant, quite incredibly, as Arsenal controlled the game and, better yet, gained the lead through a Santi Cazorla penalty after Nacho Monreal was brought down - how easily is another debate - by Vincent Kompany. But that seemed to be the only moment when Sanchez wasn't involved. The Chilean was holding the baton, conducting the orchestra and yet also playing some solos of his own. Sanchez (right) gets involved in the celebrations with Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla after the first goal . Aguero (left) cuts a frustrated figure after Olivier Giroud doubles Arsenal's advantage at the Etihad . Sanchez was picking passes at will, dictating the pace and direction of the game in the first-half . The result leaves Man City five points behind Chelsea in the Premier League title race . Fernandinho had been assigned the task of minder. Early on, Sanchez played the role of little silver ball to pinball machine bumper. On six minutes, he showed immaculate chest control to bring an Arsenal move infield but the Brazilian snatched the ball. Game over. Sanchez would have to be persistent. He mainly occupied the open acres on the left but willingly drove inside. At one point, he thrillingly squeezed between two blue shirts only to be swallowed by four more on the edge of the box. As has so often been shown this season, Sanchez is indefatigable. One minute he was performing defensive duties, dispossessing James Milner and knocking it out for a throw, the next he was charging down Martin Demichelis as he hacked clear. As Arsenal sat back a little more following Cazorla's penalty, Sanchez refused to follow suit but his forward charges increasingly led down blind alleys. Fernandinho started to take control and perhaps the Chilean might have dropped back more to help the increasingly-stretched back line. But what of Aguero? Frankly, he was anonymous. For a side who found themselves five points behind leaders Chelsea after Saturday's action, they had surprisingly little impetus. On 34 minutes, the Argentine positioned his body to win a corner - set-pieces were pretty much their only threat in the first-half - but it was his first contribution in about 25 minutes. Ironically, the corner was headed away by, you've guessed it, Alexis Sanchez. The first-half heat map for Alexis Sanchez shows how he gravitated to the left side to orchestrate attacks . Sergio Aguero, by contrast, was starved of touches in the Arsenal box during a quiet first-half . The start of the second-half suggested the tide was turning. City started brightly, pressed incessantly and looked like scoring at last. Aguero set the tone, cutting inside from the right, onto his left foot, before forcing a fingertip save from Ospina. All of a sudden, he was everywhere, the touchpaper lit. He tried to shoot with the outside of his right boot but it sliced away from goal as unmarked team-mates glared at him. The equaliser seemed inevitable. Sanchez just wasn't in the game, his ball-carrying instinct nullified as Arsenal struggled to gain the ball. Then, out of nowhere, a sucker punch. Fernando was caught napping, Cazorla pinched the ball and Olivier Giroud headed home for 2-0. As the Arsenal players celebrated with knee slides in front of their delirious fans, Sanchez greeted the goal with a high-pitched screech. It obviously meant a lot. In all honesty, Cazorla was overshadowing everyone. The man known as the 'Little Magician' was outstanding, the best on the park. His execution of the first-half penalty was perfect, his cross for the second unstoppable. Like Sanchez, he drove Arsenal on - probably more often. You lost count of the number of times the No 19 was visible on the back, streaking away into space. While Sanchez was impressive, it was Santi Cazorla who made more of a difference for Arsenal . Cazorla dispatches his first-half penalty past the outstretched Joe Hart to give Arsenal the lead . His touch was assured, his energy limitless, his creativity infinite. Cazorla was the difference. Still, despite his efforts, you sensed a big finale was in store. Aguero's partner-in-crime, Edin Dzeko was introduced from the bench. Sanchez exited the stage with seven minutes left, replaced by Kieran Gibbs as Arsenal shored up the barricades. The travelling fans applauded warmly, it had been another excellent performance by their star signing from the summer. Moments later, Aguero raced 60 yards to catch up with Gibbs as he sprinted clear down the left. The striker pulled back his shirt and earned a booking. The effort was admirable but it kind of summed up his afternoon. The late onslaught never came, this was a poor City display. The Etihad was half-empty long before the end as a massive blow in the title race was dealt. Sanchez had well and truly got the better of Aguero in the battle of the South Americans.

"Brazil legend Ronaldo said on Wednesday that he will try to get back into shape with an eye on coming out of retirement to play for North American second division club Fort Lauderdale Strikers. The 38-year-old three-times FIFA world player of the year, who last played professionally with Corinthians in 2011, recently became a minority owner in the North American Soccer League's Strikers. During a news conference attended by the mayor of Fort Lauderdale and NASL leadership, Ronaldo was asked whether he was planning a comeback.

"An internet feed to his bedroom and a phone line to West Ham’s bench. Suffice to say, Sam Allardyce’s day away from the touchline was not altogether that relaxing. His chest infection was deemed significant enough to keep him away from this fixture, but that self-imposed exile seems to have only applied to the body. The mind was firmly in south Wales, watching stuttering footage on his home computer and calling the shots to Neil McDonald via his phone. West Ham’s manager might just have ended up with a headache for his trouble. This was a game his side should have won, having led through a goal of some beauty from Andy Carroll.

Andy Carroll scored West Ham's opener by latching on to a cross by Stewart Downing - click HERE for our brilliant Match Zone . The striker reversed some of the farcical luck that has affected him this week by opening the scoring after 43 minutes, but also contrived to miss the target altogether from three yards after Mark Noble’s 74th-minute own goal pulled Swansea level. ‘I think we should have won,’ said McDonald who, along with club officials, claimed Allardyce’s illness was not serious. ‘Sam has a chest infection so he was watching a live stream on the computer and giving us a few tips on the phone. There was a delay on the live stream I think but he was happy with what we did. ‘He has taken time off to recover and he should be fine for next week (when West Ham play Everton in an FA Cup replay on Tuesday).’ That game will be an opportunity to address a winless run that now extends to five matches in all competitions. Hardly cause for major concern for a side that always faced a formidable task in replicating their form of the first half of the season. Carroll rifled his left footed shot into the top corner past Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski . Fabianski dives to his left but he is unable to stop Carroll's shot from flying into the net . What will bother Allardyce, though, is how some of their clear openings were not turned into goals before Swansea levelled. Swansea are lobbying for the goal to be credited to Gomis, whose header had struck Noble after bouncing back of a post. One would expect those efforts given the Frenchman's need for confidence in his mission to replace Wilfried Bony. Gomis celebrated that moment with a French flag in memory of those killed in the Charlie Hebdo massacre. There was evident joy in the moment, but it remains to be seen if, primarily, he is up to replacing Bony, and also if he stays in Wales. Clubs are interested and he has not been shy in encouraging the admirers. Monk said: ‘I hope they give him the goal, he deserves it for the hard work he did. He is a top striker - there was not much to choose between him and Bony. 'I brought him in and he has been frustrated but he has shown his qualities and he has a run to keep getting better. ‘The goal meant a lot for him. He wanted to show the flag. It was a very good gesture for the people hurt in Paris and that was a really nice touch.’ West Ham goalkeeper Adrian celebrates Carroll's goal by clenching his fists and sliding on his knees .

Gomis was less than convincing with his finishing in the first, most notably when he was presented with a sight at goal in the 30th minute and dallied. He cut inside to his right foot rather than swinging the left and allowed James Tomkins to block. Would Bony have been so hesitant? West Ham improved, took control some excellent passing and led through Carroll’ s magnificent goal. He chested a Stewart Downing cross, evaded three men and found the top corner from the edge of the area. Not bad at the end of a week in which he missed a fixture with an injured foot – he kicked the floor in training – and sliced open his finger while making lunch. He now has four goals and three assists in six Premier League games against Swansea. It should have been five goals but he blew an excellent late chance after Noble’s own goal. If Allardyce's feed caught the moment his bed rest might have failed to fulfil its purpose.","West Ham striker Andy Carroll scored opener just before the half-time interval .

"Rangers great Stuart McCall has given his backing to Dave King and the Three Bears in their bid to oust Mike Ashley’s regime from the Ibrox boardroom, insisting that only investors with business brains and the best interests of the club at heart will be able to win over fans currently in open revolt. The consortium led by George Letham, Douglas Park and George Taylor will back King’s call for a General Meeting — and vote with him to remove the current board — if their alternative to Ashley’s £10 million mortgage on the stadium and training ground is rejected. Although negotiations between Letham and Rangers chief executive Derek Llambias are still ongoing, there is general scepticism over the club’s willingness to deal with anyone other than Newcastle United owner Ashley, described by former Magpies chairman Freddy Shepherd on Saturday as ‘the Bank of Rangers.’ Rangers legend Stuart McCall, pictured when he was Motherwell manager, wants a fan to take charge . McCall (left) says that only someone with the best interests of the club will win over supporters in revolt . Shepherd suggested that Ashley could yet sell his controlling stake in the English Premier League club in order to mount a genuine takeover of the club — although he believes that the Sports Direct tycoon ‘enjoys the idea of controlling two clubs’. For Nine-in-a-Row legend McCall, the chance to get rid of Ashley and replace him with genuine Rangers fans is too good to be missed. ‘What Rangers need is someone at the club who doesn’t just have business sense, but is actually doing it for the love of the club — because they’ve got ties to the club,’ said the former Scotland midfielder. ‘I don’t know any of these gentlemen (Park, Letham, Taylor) but, if you believe what you read, they have Rangers at heart. And I know Richard Gough has spoken about Dave King. ‘Now I’m not saying that, just because you have Rangers at heart, you are going to be successful and the club is going to make money. But you do know that, whatever they are doing, they are doing it for the right reasons. For McCall, Mike Ashley (pictured) should not be in charge of Rangers and needs to be replaced with a fan . Newcastle owner Ashley is not yet ready to give up his grip on power at Rangers . ‘They are not in there just for, we can do this, we can do that, we can earn this and we can get out. What you want is people that the club matters to and will do their best for the club, not for themselves as individuals. ‘If it is The Three Bears, if it is Dave King, if it anyone else, you would rather have people who bother about the club and it’s just about money making. ‘What is alarming is when they (the board) say they need so much. No-one really knows Mr Ashley’s plans or ideas because you never get a one-to-one interview, he is a private person. ‘But as a supporter, you want to know what is going on, even a little bit. It’s all of this cloak-and-dagger stuff. Mike Ashley (centre) has been described as the Bank of Rangers by Freddy Shepherd . Former Newcastle owner Freddy Shepherd described Ashley as the Bank of Rangers . ‘How is it going to be resolved? Do they need the money here and now to keep the lights on? ‘Mr Ashley has got what, eight-and-a-half or nine per cent of the club? Yet he seems to be the one making all the decisions — appointing a chief exec and a finance director etc. ‘Obviously I’ve got a lot of friends and family who are Rangers supporters — and they can’t understand how this can be the case. ‘The catalyst for everything now has been the fact that Ibrox was going to be put up as security against loans. Supporters see other people wanting to offer money and ask why Ashley is the best option.’ Shepherd told BBC Five Live’s Sportsweek programme on Sunday that Ashley was now calling all the shots at Ibrox, despite the SFA limiting his shareholding and charging him with a breach of dual influence rules, the former Newcastle chairman saying: ‘He’s now become the Bank of Rangers. He’s a very clever guy. ‘What he’s done is get ten per cent of Rangers, he can’t buy any more — so he’s lent them money and become the bank. And banks control clubs. It’s as simple as that.’ Asked if he thought Ashley was ready to sell Newcastle and buy into Rangers properly, Shepherd said: ‘Possibly. But I think he likes the idea of controlling two clubs, that’s where it’s coming from. ‘He’s put money into Rangers when they were desperate for money.’","Stuart McCall says only investors with the best interests of Rangers at heart will be able to win over the supporters .

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini is confident his side can overcome the absence of midfield driving force Yaya Toure. City will be without the influential Toure for up to another four weeks due to his involvement in the African Nations Cup with Ivory Coast. Toure was sorely missed during the tournaments of 2012 and 2013, and although he has not been at his formidable best this season, his recent form has been good. Manuel Pellegrini (right) believes Manchester City can cope without midfielder Yaya Toure (left) Pellegrini (left) watches on during his side's training session ahead of their game against Arsenal on Sunday . James Milner, who has played as a forward in recent weeks for City, pictured during a training session . David Silva controls the ball during Manchester City's training session on Friday, two days before they play Arsenal . Following last week's draw with Everton - the first match of Toure's absence - City have actually not won in the Barclays Premier League without the former Barcelona player since last April. Toure was rested when City were surprisingly held by Burnley on December 28 and also when they drew at Arsenal in September. Pellegrini said: 'Of course we are going to miss Yaya because he is a very important player - in the same way that we miss Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko, David Silva, or all the players that for different reasons cannot play every week. 'But we have a squad and we have to replace Yaya. We must continue fighting for the title with or without Yaya. We have to play two more games without Yaya and he will arrive here in February. I don't think our team depends just on one player.' In terms of league action, Toure will definitely miss Sunday's return clash against Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium and the January 31 trip to title rivals Chelsea. City have coped without the 31-year-old before, most recently in the Champions League when he missed the vital wins over Bayern Munich and Roma in November and December through suspension. Toure himself is confident City can come through the spell. Joe Hart (left) keeps out a shot that fellow goalkeeper Willy Caballero (right) was unable to get a hand to . Jesus Navas will look to fill the void left by Toure's departure for the African Cup of Nations . Sergio Aguero is returning to fitness for City after missing most of December and the Christmas period with a knee injury . Frank Lampard will look to continue his fine form for the Premier League champions when they take on Arsenal . Speaking in an interview while on international duty, Toure told CNN: 'I think City can compete without me to be honest with you. 'We get fantastic players and I think you've been able to see when we miss Aguero with injury, we've been able to cope without him. 'When you see we miss Kompany we've been able to cope without him, but at the moment I think we're in good shape.' In the same interview, however, Toure did give further mixed messages about his future. Toure sparked considerable speculation over his status at City during an unsettled last summer when he voiced criticisms of the club amid the notorious birthday cake saga. He again cast doubt over his position when asked if he would still be at Eastlands next season. 'I don't know. I'm at City at the moment,' he said, before laughing. It is not the first time Toure has been vague on the subject but Pellegrini has no concerns about it. The Chilean said: 'I think Yaya is 100 per cent committed with our team and with this team. I don't have any doubts about that.' When pressed further Pellegrini, speaking at a press conference to preview the Arsenal game, acknowledged circumstances can change but presently has no doubts and insists there is no link to last year's issues. He said: 'I don't think any of us know what will happen in six months more. We don't know where you can be, we cannot know what will happen in the future. Goalkeeper Hart appeared in jubilant spirits ahead during the City session . Defender Gael Clichy (centre) shares a joke with his team-mates ahead of the training session . Bacary Sagna (second right) warms up as he gets ready for the game against the team he left to join City in the summer . 'But it's not a problem with his commitment. You can't link one thing with the other. I repeat, Yaya is very happy here. His commitment with our club is not a problem.' Toure has played a key role in City's development over recent years and Pellegrini is determined to maintain progress, with success in the Champions League an obvious target. Pellegrini recently suggested his playmaker David Silva lacks the recognition he deserves because he is not at one of Europe's bigger clubs. However, he believes winning Europe's greatest prize with City is a realistic ambition and accolades for individuals could then follow. Asked if City could one day win the Champions League, Pellegrini said: 'I think so, the way we are growing, and we will continue improving with this squad and bringing in new players. Of course, I think we have chances to continue winning important things. 'Maybe we do not have the whole history of Real Madrid, Barcelona or Manchester United but that is part of the reason this club tries to improve every year. 'We need to win important trophies and that way our top players will be on the list of the best players of the year. 'Our club must improve and grow every year, winning important titles.'","Manchester City have been gearing up to take on Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday .

A miserable afternoon for the keeper summed up by Sanchez's free kick that crept passed him. RYAN SHAWCROSS – 5.5 . Imposing physically but couldn't deal with Arsenal's clever movement in front of him. PHILIPP WOLLSCHEID – 5 . Welcome to the Premier League.

The 26-year-old has thanked Chelsea's midfielders for helping him find the back of the net on a consistent basis. He added: 'If my first goal didn’t come in the first few games I would have still been confident. 'That is because the team we have is such a great one and the ability of the players that play in midfield and feed the striker is very high, so I always knew goals would come.'

He said: 'Good striker. If they have the money and no problems with FFP, well done. Rules are different for City.' VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Jose Mourinho has raised questions about Manchester City's signing of Wilfried Bony (right) Bony joined Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year deal, and he will wear the No 14 shirt . The 26-year-old puts pen-to-paper on his deal with Premier League champions City . City's signing of Bony means they now boast four  of the Barclays Premier League’s top five goalscorers of 2014 - Bony, Yaya Toure, Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko. Manuel Pellegrini's side are two points behind Chelsea in the title race, but Mourinho believes his side are not favourtes. He said: 'We are not favourites for the title, we are candidates. I would say the same if we were two points behind.' Chelsea travel to Swansea on Saturday but Mourinho is still expecting a difficult test from Gary Monk's side despite the loss of Bony. He said: 'Swansea have a very good team and very good teams don't depend on one player. Losing Bony doesn't make them less difficult.' Mourinho also refused to deny whether he called referee Phil Dowd fat after Chelsea's 5-3 defeat to Tottenham earlier in the month. Mourinho was alleged to have said: ‘You’re too fat to referee, you should retire.’ Mourinho is also said to have shouted. ‘You’ve cost us.’ But when asked about the incident on Friday, he said: 'He made a big mistake. But when I got to his room, I go in a privileged position having watched it on TV.' Mourinho is said to have berated referee Phil Dowd over his performance in the 5-3 defeat at Tottenham . The Chelsea boss allegedly described Dowd as being 'too fat to referee' and told him he should retire .","Manchester City signed £25million striker Wilfried Bony on Wednesday .

"Crystal Palace have failed in a £3.5million swoop for Swansea left-back Neil Taylor. The Welsh club rejected the bid on Thursday night for the 25-year-old, who is also is a target for West Bromwich Albion. Taylor is entering the final 18 months of his contract at Swansea City and Garry Monk is said to be searching the market for left backs, suggesting a deal could be done this window. Neil Taylor (right) of Swansea City is attracting interest from West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace . Baggies boss Tony Pulis has been unconvinced by Sebastien Pocognoli, preferring to start Chris Baird in the win over Hull City, and is keen to do extensive business in January. Palace have been desperate for a natural left back with Joel Ward and Martin Kelly asked to cover their weaker flank frequently this season.

"London Irish director of rugby Brian Smith will leave the club at the end of the season, after deciding to return home to Australia with his family. The former England attack coach, who was part of Martin Johnson's management team at the last World Cup, is in his second stint in charge of the Exiles. Sportsmail understands that Smith informed his employers before Christmas that he would be moving Down Under in the summer, to end an association with Irish stretching back to 2005. London Irish director of rugby Brian Smith will leave the club at the end of the current season . Former England attack coach Smith will return to his native Australia with his family . There has been speculation linking ex-Ireland coach Declan Kidney to the job, but it is thought that the Exiles' difficult financial position will guard against such a high-profile appointment. Meanwhile, Smith has been mentioned in connection with a coaching role at the Brisbane-based Queensland Reds, but with Michael Cheika recently taking charge of the Wallabies, there is also the possibility of an opening with Super 15 champions the Waratahs in Sydney. Irish have been in the lower reaches of the Aviva Premiership table this season, but in his previous spell with the Exiles, Smith guided the team to the Heineken Cup semi-finals and third place in the league.

"Thierry Henry has brought an end to his illustrious playing career by announcing his retirement from professional football. The former Arsenal striker left New York Red Bulls at the end of the MLS season and he will now take up a position at Sky Sports as a pundit. The French forward joins Sky's already strong line-up of analysts including Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher and Jamie Redknapp. Thierry Henry was Arsenal's leading scorer with 228 goals, 175 of those in the Premier League . Henry has been confirmed as a full-time pundit for Sky Sports . Henry will be remembered as one of the best strikers the Premier League has ever seen after what he achieved at Arsenal. Having moved to north London from Juventus in 1999, the Frenchman spent eight years as a Gunner and became a legend at the club. Henry is the highest scorer in Arsenal's history with 228 goals in all competitions, 175 of those coming in the Premier League. He helped Arsene Wenger's side win the Premier League and FA Cup double in 2002 and was also part of the invincible title-winning team of 2004.

He returned to Arsenal for a loan spell in January 2012, scoring the winner against Leeds in the FA Cup and Sunderland in the league. But Henry's four-year stay in New York has now come to an end, and he will take up a role as an analyst with Sky Sports. The Frenchman said: 'I’ve been fortunate enough to have had an amazing playing career with many incredible memories and now I can’t wait for the next chapter to begin with Sky Sports.

Henry had been tipped to go into management once he hung up his boots and while he will be joining Sky in the studio, he has not ruled out a career in the dugout. He told Sky Sports: 'I don’t know if I can be a good coach or not, but the desire is there. We’ll see. Just because you can play the game doesn’t mean you can teach it - dealing with egos and lifting people.' But Henry did admit he did not think a third return to Arsenal was not a good idea. 'We didn’t talk too much about that,’ said Henry. ‘How many comebacks do you make? It would have turned into a bad movie. It would have been like the film Rocky, you like the first one but what about the last one?' Henry scored on his second debut as his winner saw off Leeds in the FA Cup at the Emirates Stadium . The French striker scored the winner against Sunderland  in his final Premier League game for Arsenal . Henry left Arsenal in 2007 and spent three years at Barcelona, where he won the Champions League .

I would have loved him to be on the same team as me during my playing career, I’m delighted we’re finally on the same side.' And Sportsmail and Sky's Jamie Redknapp added: 'I know from playing against Thierry how good a player he was and Sky Sports viewers are in for a treat. 'His game was built around incredible pace, power and finishing, not to mention the ability to read the game better than most. His views will be fascinating and I can’t wait to work alongside him.'

"Shane Geraghty has become England's forgotten man in recent seasons but the London Irish No 10 delivered a sweetly struck drop goal to snatch victory over Exeter at the Madejski Stadium yesterday. The Exiles looked buried towards the end of a scrappy contest but, with the clock in red, Geraghty converted from 30 metres to secure his side's second win in nine games. It prompted calls from director of rugby Brian Smith for the 28-year-old to be handed an international recall, having gone off the radar since emerging as the next big thing in 2007. London Irish fought back to beat Exeter 28-26 in their Aviva Premiership clash on Sunday afternoon . 'There are very few ball players who want to step up like that,' said Smith. 'It shows the class of the player to get us home at the death. He's definitely international class and I wouldn't swap him for another ball player in the league. 'A lot of things came his way early and easily. He was a prodigious talent but he's a better player now than when he got his chances for England. If Shane was at a top-four club, everyone would be behind him. He hasn't changed as a player but he's matured a lot as a person.' Geraghty's last Test was against New Zealand in 2009, but the playmaker has not given up on his international ambitions. 'I spoke to Stuart (Lancaster, the England coach) before the autumn and he said to just keep playing well,' said Geraghty. 'There are a lot of talented players in that 10 position, so I'm not expecting a call-up any time soon in that regard. But I still think I can offer something at 12 or even off the bench.' The last minute drop goal from Shane Geraghty sent Exeter down to a fourth consecutive Premiership defeat . The visitors were outscored by four tries to two but the kicking of Gareth Steenson  kept the Chiefs in the hunt . Irish have been unable to generate any momentum this season and Geraghty's late three points ended a losing streak at the Madejski dating back to September. Exeter, too, are woefully out of form. The opening quarter was littered with the sort of mistakes you expect from two struggling sides, with silly cross-field kicks and fluffed passes undoing any good work. Promising Chiefs youngster Henry Slade rattled the left upright with a fifth-minute penalty and it remained scoreless until the 20th minute, when Gareth Steenson kicked the opening points. But the hosts hit back and, off a 12-man driving maul, flanker Blair Cowan touched down. Exeter's lineout struggled but the boot of Steenson kept the scoreboard ticking, edging his side back in front. Their opening try was as much down to Irish inaccuracies as it was to Exeter precision, with Alex Lewington sloppily knocking on before lock Dean Mumm dived over. London Irish's Blair Gowan goes over for a try during the Premiership clash on Sunday . Exiles flanker Tom Guest dives over to score a try for the hosts at the Madejski stadium . Having trailed at half-time, three tries in 12 second-half minutes from Tom Guest, Lewington and Cowan secured the bonus point and put the hosts back ahead. Exeter's response came through a close-range Dave Ewers try, but the reliable boot of Tom Homer kept the Exiles on course for a rare win. The Chiefs rallied with two penalties from Steenson but, as Chiefs defenders charged towards him, up stepped Geraghty with the perfect kick. It leaves Exeter in fifth position and director of rugby Rob Baxter admits his side need to snap back into life if they want to keep up their play-off challenge. 'We're going through that period where a win is proving tough to find,' said Baxter. 'It can be difficult to break the cycle. There will be some brutal honesty.'

"Aviva Premiership club London Irish have confirmed rugby director Brian Smith's departure from the club. Irish said Smith has been granted early release from his contract - which was due to expire on June 30 this year - on 'compassionate grounds' and he will return to Australia for family reasons. Exiles forwards coach Glenn Delaney will take on the role of interim head coach between now and the end of this season. Aviva Premiership club London Irish have confirmed rugby director Brian Smith's departure from the club . Former England attack coach Smith, 48, had two spells with Irish as rugby director. He was in charge between 2005 and 2008, guiding the club to a third-place Premiership finish and the European Challenge Cup final. He also took Irish to the 2008 Heineken Cup semi-finals, when they were beaten by Toulouse at Twickenham. Smith then spent three years with England, before returning to Irish. 'My family has to be my priority right now, which is why I have asked to be released from my contract early,' he said. 'I have thoroughly enjoyed my 10-year association with London Irish and I will look back on my time with fond memories.' Irish are currently 20 points above Premiership bottom club and red-hot relegation favourites London Welsh, effectively securing their top-flight status for another season. Irish said Smith has been granted early release from his contract - which was due to expire on June 30 . Smith guided London Irish to a 10th placed finish in the Aviva Premiership last season . Delaney, meanwhile, will be assisted by Richard Whiffin and Mark Tainton, and the club's academy coaching team of former Exiles players Nick Kennedy, Declan Danaher and Paul Hodgson. Irish host Grenoble in the European Challenge Cup on Saturday, still harbouring quarter-final ambitions in that competition. Irish executive chairman David Fitzgerald added: 'London Irish is grateful to Brian Smith for the contribution he has made to the club. 'He led us to the greatest experience we've had to date of European rugby, and introduced some great players to the club. 'We believe that, following Sunday's results at Madejski Stadium and Kingston Park (where Newcastle beat London Welsh), our Premiership status for next season is more or less secure and allows us to focus on preparing for next season. 'All involved with London Irish, especially the new owners, would like to personally thank Brian for his considerable contribution over the last two-and-a-half years, and wish him and his family well for the future.' Irish say they will announce a new head coach 'in due course'. Former Ireland boss Declan Kidney is thought to be in the frame.

"Manchester United have agreed to sell Chile striker Angelo Henriquez to Dinamo Zagreb for a fee in the region of £1million. Henriquez cost £4m when he moved to Old Trafford in the summer of 2012 from Universidad de Chile but never played a competitive game for United, scoring once in a pre-season friendly against Swedish club AIK a year later. He went out on loan to Wigan Athletic and Real Zaragoza before making a season-long move to Zagreb where he has scored 10 goals so far this season. Manchester United striker Angelo Henriquez will join Dinamo Zagreb on a permanent basis in the summer . United signed Henriquez, pictured scoring in a pre-season friendly in August 2013,  from Universidad de Chile . The deal included an option for the Croatian side to sign Henriquez permanently in the summer, and coach Zoran Mamic confirmed that terms have now been agreed. With so many star names in Louis van Gaal’s squad, Henriquez had already indicated that his future would probably lie away from Old Trafford. ‘We have bought him outright,’ said Mamic. ‘Taking Henriquez depends on us, not on Manchester United. We took him with the right of first refusal, which stands at around €1.5m (£1.1m), and we have already signed a contract with him for the summer. There is no longer any doubt – he is ours and the story is resolved.'

"Aston Villa have now gone eight hours and 42 minutes of football without scoring after losing 2-0 against Liverpool at home, with Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert getting the goals. Boos rang around Villa Park as they yet again gave the home fans little to cheer about. Here, DOMINIC KING gives his ratings from the Barclays Premier League match. ASTON VILLA (4-3-3) Brad Guzan – Stood firm when Sterling went clean through and made an excellent fingertip save in second half when the Italian threatened – 7.5 . Alan Hutton – Aggressive and tried to push Villa forward; no blame could be attached to him for either goal conceded – 6.5 . Jores Okore – Did well in the first half and, like Baker, couldn’t be named as the reason Villa ended up floundering – 6 . Fabio Borini (left) and Aston Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan (right) check for an offside flag for the first goal . Nathan Baker – Commanding display when the sides met at Anfield; not so impressive here but not the worst by any means – 6 . Aly Cissokho – Didn’t give Liverpool any reason to regret not making his loan move permanent; anonymous for most of the match – 5 . Ashley Westwood – Normally assured and steady and keeps the ball ticking over but nothing of the sort here and was hauled off – 5 . Carlos Sanchez – Pick of Villa’s midfield, bright and energetic. Could have done with a few more performing like that around him – 7 . Carlos Sanchez gives Raheem Sterling a kicking during the Premier League defeat at Villa Park . Fabian Delph – At the heart of Villa’s best moments in the second half but costly error when caught in possession gave Liverpool their second goal – 6.5 . Tom Cleverley – Had no impact at all; cheers from The Holte End when Lambert finally took the wise decision and substituted him – 4 . Gabby Agbonlahor – Lots of running up and down the field and ran around the ball a lot but hardly touched it. No shots at goal – 4 . Christian Benteke – Threatened to come to life in the second period but impact fizzled out after a shot was saved by Mignolet – 6 .

Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert has been under pressure and he reacts during the Premier League match . LIVERPOOL (3-4-3) Simon Mignolet – Struggled with ball at his feet, misjudged crosses and made some fine saves; his season in 90 minutes – 7.5 . Emre Can – This new system has enabled Rodgers to shoehorn the German into his team; not always foot sure but is improving – 8 . Martin Skrtel – Pick of Liverpool’s defence, his efforts summed up by one sliding tackle to deny Benteke in the second half – 7.5 . Liverpool goalkeeper Mingolet pictured during the Premier League match at Villa Park . Mamadou Sakho – Looks more settled now in this team; his gait may be awkward but he did exactly what was expected of him – 6.5 . Lazar Markovic – Not as impressive as he was last week at Sunderland but bright in possession, covered the hard yards and sensible in possession – 6.5 . Jordan Henderson – Found his stride in recent weeks; usual enthusiasm and prodigious work rate, his ball for Borini’s goal was magnificent – 8 . Lucas Leiva – Rodgers rightly quelled talk of him joining Inter Milan this week; is playing too important a role at the moment – 7.5 . Raheem Sterling misses a good chance to make it 2-0 to Liverpool against Aston Villa on Saturday . Borini has his shot to score the opening goal against  Aston Villa during the Premier League match .

Fabio Borini – His running gave Liverpool purpose and he took his goal well but there were other moments that left something to be desired – 7 . Raheem Sterling – Back from a mid-season holiday; fluffed a glorious chance to kill the game with a lazy finish straight at Guzan – 6.5 . Philippe Coutinho – Another who is getting better; big impact and some moments, particularly in first half, were of highest quality – 8.5 .

"Manchester United suffered a setback in the race for the top four after they lost to rivals Southampton last weekend. Fortunately for Louis van Gaal, United are blessed with plenty of cash they could spend on reinforcements in the January transfer window. Having already spent £150million last summer on mostly attacking talent, United's defence remains a cause for concern. Here Sportsmail looks at the targets they could sign. Aymeric Laporte (Athletic Bilbao) Aymeric Laporte (left), pictured here battling Real Madrid's James Rodriguez, has been facing La Liga's best . The 20-year-old Frenchman is a great athlete but still raw. As with Ander Herrera, Bilbao will only consider a deal at buy-out clause level, which is understood to be £32m after a contract revision last June. That represents a big gamble for such a young player. However, Laporte has impressed this season for Bilbao, making 3.9 interceptions per game  - the second highest in La Liga. And former Bilbao manager Marcelo Bielsa certainly rates Laporte highly, tweeting: 'Laporte is a great player, with lots of qualities. I can't remember a fault that I could tell you.' Joao Miranda (Atletico Madrid) Joao Mirande celebrates scoring for Atletico Madrid against Eibar earlier in the season . Atletico need money to service growing debts and will listen to bids but would prefer to sell in the summer. Brazilian centre-back Miranda is 30 and would cost £23m due to a reported release clause in his contract. Team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez are younger and represent better value for United. The emergence of 19-year-old Gimenez this season has possibly convinced Atletico that now is the right time to sell Miranda. Convincing him to leave Madrid may prove difficult, however. 'Staying at Atleti was the best for me and my family. I’m very happy to be at Atleti. I love Madrid and this is a great club,' he said when linked with a move away last summer. Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) Mats Hummels signs autographs during Dortmund's training camp in Spain earlier this month . Dortmund are in crisis, joint bottom of the Bundesliga after 17 games, and selling their captain would be a disaster on and off the pitch. His father Hermann says there is no deal to be done but some would argue Hummels' form hasn't helped their plight and £35m is a lot to turn down. Let's not forget that Dortmund are a club accustomed to losing their best players annually and have seen the likes of Nuri Sahin, Shinji Kagawa, Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski leave in consecutive seasons. Asked about his future on Monday, Hummels was somewhat ambiguous. 'I have always decided not to leave. I think I have made some good decisions and I want to make those in the future as well,' Hummels told Sky Sports News. 'I have never said I will stay until 2024 or 2030 or whenever. But I have stayed until today. I will stick to my way of not promising anything and maybe leave someday instead of saying I will stay forever and then leave all of a sudden.' Seamus Coleman (Everton) Seamus Coleman (left) battling West Ham's Enner Valencia before crashing out of the FA Cup on Tuesday . Roberto Martinez has insisted none of his players are for sale but offers above £25m would make Everton think. United want a right back but Chelsea also have a long-standing interest in Coleman and would rival any offer. Coleman would be comfortable at right back or wing back in Van Gaal's preferred 3-5-2 formation and is a proven Premier League performer who could instantly step in and improve United's creaking defence. Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa) Ron Vlaar has struggled with injuries for Aston Villa this season after an impressive World Cup . Throw enough money at it and this is a deal that could be done this month. But United have shown no inclination so far to sign the 29-year-old who is out of contract in the summer. The central defender has suffered a spate of injuries restricting him to just 12 appearances for Villa this season and is currently out for at least a month with a knee injury. This a concern for United who have suffered their own run of defensive injuries. Vlaar, however, was a part of Van Gaal's Holland squad during the World Cup and certainly impressed his manager. 'He was the most important defender for Holland and he is always stable which is important. I was very happy with him,' he said. Nicolas Otamendi (Valencia) Nicolas Otamendi (top) celebrates scoring the winning goal for Valencia against Real Madrid earlier this month . The 26-year-old centre-back is a tough, warrior-type defender and Argentina international who United watched while at Porto last season. Otamendi has been a mainstay of Valencia' defence this season, playing 18 times and scoring the winner against Real Madrid earlier this month. He can also play right back - a bonus for Van Gaal who likes his players to be tactically flexible. Otamendi also reportedly has a close relationship with international team-mate Angel di Maria which may help any potential move, though his £40m buyout clause could prove prohibitive.","Manchester United are still after new recruits to improve a shaky defence .

"Midfielder Angel di Maria has urged fans to forget about the old Manchester United style as manager Louis van Gaal is creating something new. Under the lengthy reign of Sir Alex Ferguson, the Red Devils developed a certain way of playing which brought untold success and silverware to Old Trafford. Since his departure, the club have gone through a period of significant readjustment during the ill-fated short-lived tenure of David Moyes and now Van Gaal. Manchester United winger Angel di Maria arrives at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in Zurich on Monday . Di Maria (top row, 2nd left) was named in the FIFA FIFPro World XI team of the year . The Argentina international poses with his wife Jorgelina Cardoso at Monday's Gala . But Di Maria has advised supporters who continue to harp back to the days of Ferguson's football that they are wasting their time. 'From the start of the season to now, you can see that we've grown,' he told MUTV. 'We weren't so great at the beginning but we've started getting a few victories under our belts. 'There are some people saying that we're not playing in a particularly good style or that it's not the old Manchester United - but it's not. 'We're beginning something new here. We've got a new style, we've got a new manager and we're all working hard to make sure we're putting Manchester United back where it belongs. Di Maria returned to United's starting line-up against Southampton for the first time since November . Di Maria said Louis van Gaal, pictured watching the Under 18s on Tuesday, is creating a new style at United . 'We're focusing on growing as a team, working hard and getting as many points as we can. 'We all know the Premier League is difficult, but all we're focusing on now is meeting our objectives and our targets for the year. 'So whether it's qualifying for the Champions League, making sure that we do well in the FA Cup or getting as high in the league as possible, these are things we are going for now.' Di Maria's arrival in the summer as the club's £59.7million record signing has not been all plain sailing, with Sunday's defeat by Southampton the Argentina international's first appearance in the starting line-up since November because of injury. Di Maria was on the losing siude at the weekdnd as Manchester United were beaten by Southampton . The 26-year-old admits adjusting following his switch from Real Madrid has taken some time, but is targeting a major improvement in the second half of the season. 'It is difficult for a player, especially when you come to a new club,' he added. 'You just want to arrive and you want to show them how well you can play. 'So when these things happen it is unfortunate but, that said, the important thing was that when I came back I needed to make sure that I could help the team and that's what I did. 'It's important for me and important for the team to be really doing my best and showing what I am capable of.'","Angel di Maria admits Manchester United's start to the season wasn't great .

"They're a long way off. But expecting mom Ashley Gardner has given her not-yet-born quadruplets a costume of their own this Halloween. Celebrating the miracle surgery that saved all four children last week, she excitedly got into the festive mood by wearing a skeleton outfit - with four little skeleton characters printed on her ballooning pregnant belly. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Festive feeling! Ashley Gardner dressed up her pregnant belly with this bespoke Halloween costume . It came just days after Ashley and her husband Tyson were hauled into the hospital for emergency surgery to save the four girls. 'Happy halloween everyone!!!' Ashley wrote on Facebook, giving a 21-week update on her pregnancy. 'Doctor appointment went GREAT! All 4 girls are looking wonderful! They will continue to monitor weekly! But for now I just need to keep doing what I'm doing!' Last Monday, it emerged that one set of twins had contracted twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) - a condition which affects identical twins, causing an unequal flow of blood between the twins. In an operation that experts branded 'miraculous', all four were saved. Ashley and Tyson Gardner captured the nation's emotions with their news that she was pregnant with quadruplets after spending eight years trying to conceive - a one in 70 million chance. Delight: After hours of grueling surgery, Ashley and Tyson Gardner have celebrated as all four babies are safe . Fears: They were rushed to Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital on Monday when doctors saw that one set of twins could be losing blood and Ashley appeared to be approaching labor at just 19 weeks of pregnancy . The couple was flown to a specialist center at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where Ashley was admitted for surgery last Tuesday. On Thursday, after hours of surgery, the couple revealed on Facebook that doctors recorded steady heartbeats for all four of the unborn babies. They added: 'God is GOOD! Prayers have been answered!! Miracles continue to take place. ALL the babies survived the surgery, they heard 4 heartbeats today! We want to thank all of you for being part of our miracle!! We don't know how to say THANK YOU enough!! xoxo' 'We haven't slept much the past few days,' Tyson told ABC News. He said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor. On Wednesday, doctors performed the emergency surgery to more equally divert blood flow between one set of the Gardner twins. 'Today, we're doing much better,' he said. 'The last few days have been really rough ... very scary.' Ashley Gardner, a Utah woman (pictured here recently) who captured the nation with her news that she was pregnant with quadruplets after spending eight years trying to conceive has been rushed to hospital for emergency surgery - it was a success according to the family . Ashley pictured in a photo last week at 19 weeks. According to a Facebook page which updates their followers Ashley and Tyson Gardner, from Utah, flew to see a specialist surgeon in California yesterday following a meeting with their doctor about their two sets of identical twins . The family posted this message to their Facebook today after the successful surgery . The couple also found out that Ashley's cervix is opening prematurely as a result of the condition. Ashley underwent surgery today and was given 'meds to halt any contraction that might occur.' A few hours later the anxious family revealed the surgery went well. They posted on Facebook: 'It went great. Dr. Chmait smiled and said, 'This has been a good day!' Our tears have been replaced with relief and continue to pray for the babies safety and continued 'baking' for a good long time!! Stunned: This is the moment Ashley and Tyson Gardner, for Utah, found out they were having quadruplets in the summer after spending eight years trying to conceive. Above, Mrs Gardner stares at the screen in the ultrasound . 70-million-to-one odds: The couple were delighted to learn their first round of IVF was successful in July following a long battle with infertility. But they were later stunned to discover they were having four babies . Caught on camera: Their incredible reaction to the news was captured in hospital by friend Alicia Hallock . Twin to twin transfusion is caused by an abnormal connecting of blood vessels in the twins' shared placenta which results in an imbalance of blood flow from one twin to the other. It affects approximately 15% of identical twins who share the same placenta. One twin is often larger than the other twin and receives more blood than usual from the placenta. This can put a strain on the baby's heart and makes this twin produce more urine than normal, resulting in extra fluid around the baby, within the amniotic sac. This can be uncomfortable for the mother and also increases the risk to the pregnancy by causingpremature labour due to the extra pressure on the neck of the womb (cervix). The other twin is usually smaller and may become anaemic due to receiving less blood from the placenta. The treatments for TTTS pregnancies depend, in part, on when in pregnancy the twins become affected. If the twins are mature enough to survive outside the womb (beyond 25 weeks), immediate delivery is an option for TTTS babies. Fetal laser surgery may be done to stop the flow of blood from one twin to the other. Another treatment is amnioreduction -  a procedure whereby fluid is taken from around the twin with polyhydramnios to try and prevent premature delivery. A needle is passed through the abdomen into the sac of the recipient twin and fluid removed. Source: Liverpool Women's NHS . 'Ashley will be put on bed rest from here on out. They then posted: 'The doctor just came out and said the babies are cured of twin to twin transfusion... he said that part couldn't have gone better!!!' Twin to twin transfusion is caused by an abnormal connecting of blood vessels in the twins' shared placenta which results in an imbalance of blood flow from one twin to the other.

Their incredible reaction to the news was captured in hospital by their friend, Alicia Hallock, and later uploaded online. Footage shows the couple gazing open-mouthed at the screen, before Mrs Gardner places her hand on her forehead and breathes out. The pair then start laughing in delight, while the mother-to-be holds up scans of her four babies. Speaking to CNN, Mrs Gardner, who suffers from endometriosis - a condition which sees cells from the lining of the womb grow in other areas of the body - said she was shocked but excited to discover she was pregnant with quadruplets. 'I couldn't think straight. I had never been so excited and terrified in the same instant. We waited so long to have babies so we were so happy,' she said. 'But at that time we literally had never even thought once about this being a possibility. We didn't know anything about having quads and the risks that go with it. But overall, we were just excited.' She added that her doctor 'didn't believe it' when he learned the news from the ultrasound technician - and asked her to come back the following week so he could 'see for himself'.

Above, the Gardners . Before getting pregnant, Mrs Gardner spent eight years trying 'everything' to counter the fertility problems caused by her condition, which can also result in intense pain. She adopted a specific diet, underwent a laparoscopy, took medication and had four failed rounds of intrauterine insemination, before finally saving up for IVF. 'My endometriosis was so bad that we found during the IVF process that it had compromised my eggs. They all started dying off and left us with one perfect egg and one good egg,' she said. 'They put both back to give me the best odds of one sticking. The chances of even getting one to stick was 40 per cent. To have both stick and both split... well, that's a one-in-70 million chance!' But despite her joy, Mrs Gardner said she is aware of the risks involved in her pregnancy, writing on Facebook: 'I am extremely high risk and things can change at a moments notice for us.'

"Ohio executed a condemned killer for fatally stabbing the 15-year-old son of his former employers in what was the state's first execution in six months. Mark Wiles, 49, dropped his final appeal last week, and died by lethal injection earlier today, ending an unofficial moratorium on the death . penalty that occurred while the state and a federal judge wrangled over . Ohio's lethal injection procedures. For his special meal, . Wiles requested a large pizza with pepperoni and extra cheese, hot . sauce, a garden salad with ranch dressing, a large bag of Cheetos, a . whole cheesecake, fresh strawberries, vanilla wafers and Sprite. Mark Wiles, 49, dropped his final appeal last week, and is scheduled to die by injection later today . Wiles broke into the house of his former employer, Carol Klima, but was caught in the act by Mark Klima, the couple's son. Afraid of leaving behind a witness who could return him to prison, Wiles stabbed and beat the boy until he finally stopped moving, then left the knife buried in his victim's back. Wiles told members of the Ohio Parole Board during a March 2 interview he wasn't sure he deserved mercy but was asking for clemency because he had to. The execution marked the first . time in six months Ohio has put someone to death. Wiles' defense team had argued he should be spared because he confessed to the . crime, has shown extreme remorse and regret and has a good prison . record. 'Mark does want to live out his natural life in prison,' his attorneys said in their application for clemency. They added, 'his remorse and regret are so overwhelming that he could not articulate reasons his life should be spared.' Mark Wiles stabbed and beat Mark Kilma until he finally stopped moving, then left the knife buried in his back . Wiles could easily have escaped the farmhouse after Mark Klima surprised him, Portage County Prosecutor Victor Vigluicci told the parole board. 'Instead Wiles chose to repeatedly plunge the eight-inch kitchen knife into Mark Klima again and again,' Vigluicci said. A report to the parole board said Wiles had suffered a head injury in a bar 12 days before the slaying in Rootstown in northeast Ohio, and a doctor testified that tests indicate he may have an injury to part of the brain that regulates impulse control. Another doctor agreed that Wiles has a brain injury and said he also has a substance abuse problem and personality disorder. The parole board earlier this month ruled unanimously that Wiles' execution should proceed because he exploited the family's kindness and because his remorse doesn't outweigh the brutality of the crime. Gov. John Kasich, without additional comment, agreed with the board last week. Wiles went to prison in 1983 for stealing tools, jewelry, a wallet, a checkbook, a pistol and other items from a Tallmadge home in November 1982. Carol Klima agreed to fill out a form that March ahead of a parole hearing for Wiles. The farmhand was 'polite, very helpful and did a nice job,' she wrote on March 21, 1983. 'Yes,' she answered to the question: 'If possible, would you re-hire him?' Ohio's most recent execution delays stem from inmates' lawsuits over how well executioners perform their duties. U.S. District Court Judge Gregory Frost sided with inmates last summer and postponed executions while the state updated its procedures. Two weeks ago, after a week-long trial over the latest procedures, Frost said the state had narrowly demonstrated it was serious about following its rules. He warned prison officials to get it right the next time.","Mark Wiles, 49, died by lethal injection .

"After riding in a self-driving Toyota Prius to Google . headquarters on Tuesday, Gov Jerry Brown signed legislation paving the way for . driverless cars throughout the state of California. The bill by Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla will establish . safety and performance regulations to test and operate similar autonomous . vehicles on state roads and highways with the vehicles expected to hit the market in a decade. 'Today we're looking at science fiction becoming tomorrow's . reality - the self-driving car,' Brown said. 'Anyone who gets inside a car and . finds out the car is driving will be a little skittish, but they'll get over . it.' Scroll down for video . Approved: California Governor Jerry Brown exits a self-driving Toyota Prius before signing a driverless cars bill at Google Headquarters on Tuesday . Google Inc. has been developing autonomous car technology . and lobbying for the regulations. The company's fleet of a dozen computer-controlled . vehicles has logged more than 300,000 miles of self-driving without an . accident, according to Google. 'I think the self-driving car can really dramatically . improve the quality of life for everyone,' Google co-founder Sergey Brin said. Autonomous cars can make roads safer, free commuters from . the drudgery of driving, reduce congestion and provide transport to people who . can't drive themselves, such as the blind, disabled, elderly and intoxicated, . Brin said. 'I expect that self-driving cars will be far safer than . human-driven cars,' Brin said. The future: Gov Brown signed the bill that will work to establish safety and performance regulations to test and operate similar autonomous vehicles on state roads and highways . Laser eyes: The vehicles' Lidar system, pictured, operates it using laser radar technology along with various other computer sensors . Brin predicted that autonomous vehicles will be commercially . available within a decade. He said Google has no plans to produce its own cars, . but instead plans to partner with the automobile industry to develop autonomous . vehicles. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers expressed concern . that California is moving too quickly to embrace self-driving cars and needs to . first sort out liability issues. 'Unfortunately this legislation lacks any provision protecting . an automaker whose car is converted to an autonomous operation vehicle without . the consent or even knowledge of that auto manufacturer,' the trade group said . in a statement. Autonomous cars use computers, sensors and other technology . to operate independently, but a human driver can override the autopilot . function and take control of the vehicle at any time. With smartphone-wielding drivers more distracted than ever, . backers say robotic vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce . collisions and traffic fatalities, noting that nearly all car accidents are a . result of human error. The legislation requires the California Department of Motor . Vehicles to draft regulations for autonomous vehicles by Jan. 1, 2015. Currently, state law doesn't mention self-driving cars because the technology . is so new. The regulations would allow vehicles to operate . autonomously, but a licensed driver would still need to sit behind the wheel to . serve as a backup operator in case of emergency. The legislation also is aimed at keeping California at the . forefront of the autonomous car industry since Stanford University and Silicon . Valley companies have been working on the technology for years. Report card: A Google self-driving car is seen parked outside Google headquarters, one of a fleet that the company says have undergone more than 300,000 miles of self-driving without an accident . Manufactures: The technology placed inside a seen Toyota Prius is one of several car makers working on autonomous car technology, including Audi, BMW, Ford and Volvo . In February, Nevada became the first U.S. state to approve . regulations spelling out requirements for companies to test driverless cars on . that state's roads. Carmakers such as Audi AG, BMW AG, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo . have been working on autonomous car technology for years. In recent years, automakers also have been introducing . autonomous functions such as self-parking, lane departure warnings and adaptive . cruise-control, which allows vehicles to automatically accelerate and . decelerate with the flow of traffic. Outside a cafe in Mountain View, customers said they looked . forward to a day when their cars could drive themselves, as long as they could . do it safely. Expectations: Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, pictured beside Gov Brown, believes self-driving cars will be safer than those driven by people, while expecting them on the market within the next decade . 'It would make our streets safer,' said Barrett Howard, 33, . an auto technician. 'We wouldn't have to worry about people texting or getting . sidetracked. The computer will take over, and it will make life easier.' Abraham Eshel, a retired mechanical engineer who has vision . problems, said self-driving cars would make his life easier, too. 'If I could tell my car, ""OK, you take over when it's dark,"" and I don't have to worry about it, that would be fantastic,' said Eshel, who . lives in nearby Los Altos. 'It's a good idea.

"Sentenced: Ed Bagley was finally sentenced Wednesday for holding a mentally disabled woman captive as a sex slave he drugged and abused for six years starting when she was sixteen years old . Fans of 50 Shades of Grey are worried that the unorthodox sexual practices depicted in the erotic best-seller could face a backlash thanks to the upcoming trial of a man accused of abusing his wife who says they were simply engaging in S&M. Ed Bagley faces a federal trial early next year on 11 counts of abuse against a woman authorities say he groomed to be his sex slave. Now prosecutors plan to present consensual, though violent, acts between Bagley and his own wife Marilyn as evidence that Bagley has a history of sexually assaulting women. Defense attorneys plan to show evidence of 'sadistic sexual assaults' and S&M advocates fear that it will cause a negative public reaction to their lifestyle choices, which have come to public attention partly because of E.L. James's . Some worry the government's assertion could open up people who practice bondage, dominance, sadism and masochism - or BDSM - to criminal charges for consensual acts they're already performing, said Susan Wright, founder of the Baltimore-based National Coalition for Sexual Freedom. 'We are following this case specifically because we were hoping this issue would not come up,' she said. Ed Bagley, 45, of Lebanon, Missouri, is accused of grooming a young woman to be his sex slave starting in 2002, then keeping her captive for years while making money from her images on fetish Internet sites and forcing her to work as a dancer at strip clubs. Marilyn Bagley, 47, is charged with five counts, including sex trafficking and forced labor trafficking. Both have pleaded not guilty and are scheduled for trial in February. 'Marilyn Bagley's ""consent"" to the sexual assaults by Defendant Edward Bagley does not change whether the acts legally constitute assault or not,' prosecutors wrote in court documents filed last month. 'Pursuant to the Missouri state assault statute... consent is not a defense to assault resulting in serious physical injury.' The case came to light in early 2009 after the woman, then 23, was hospitalized after what prosecutors said was a torture session. Then-U.S. Attorney Beth Phillips called the case one of 'the most horrific ever prosecuted in this district.' Advocates for the BDSM community say even the most brutal acts detailed in Bagley's federal indictment are not criminal acts, as long as there was consent. Popularity surge: Susan Wright, founder of the Baltimore-based National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (left), said that S&M is on the rise since the release of 50 Shades of Grey (right) But if the woman was too young or not intelligent enough to consent, as prosecutors allege, or if she initially gave consent and then changed her mind, most who spoke with the AP said that would be criminal sexual abuse. It's the inclusion of Bagley's acts with his wife in the case that concerns BDSM advocates and Bagley's attorney, Susan Dill. 'Like many people from all walks of life, my client and his wife engaged in what some might term alternative, but nonetheless, consensual sexual activity that they both enjoyed,' Dill said. 'The assertion that their consensual, marital sex life is evidence of prior criminal activity is nonsensical.' As in several other states, Missouri assault laws limit instances in which consent can be used as a defense against criminal charges when serious injuries occur. Exceptions generally are made for athletic activities and the victim's occupation or professions in which the conduct and harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards. As in several other states, Missouri assault laws limit instances in which consent can be used as a defense against criminal charges when serious injuries occur. Exceptions generally are made for athletic activities and the victim's occupation or professions in which the conduct and harm are reasonably foreseeable hazards. Wright's group contends 'serious physical injury' is not well-defined under law. 'The assessment of the seriousness of harm is often affected by judges' ""moral judgments about the iniquity of the conduct,""' the organization says on its website in a section focusing on the consent issue. 'Courts tend to inflate the risk and harmfulness of an activity they want to denounce. For example, any injury caused during a sadomasochistic encounter has been consistently classified as serious.' Wright notes that regardless of the legal precedent, prosecutors' attempts to present acts between Bagley and his wife as evidence in the Missouri case also comes at a time when kinky sex practices appear to be gaining broader public acceptance amid the popularity of the E.L. James 50 Shades of Grey bondage books. 'Because of 50 Shades of Grey, a lot of people are trying BDSM for the first time this year,' she said. 'We want to be sure they understand they have to do these activities consensually, and to make sure they have the skill to do them safely.'","Man charged with abusing 'sex slave' but he says it was consensual S&M .

"Father Benedict Groeschel has sparked outrage claiming it is often boys who seduce priests in religious sex abuse cases . A friar has sparked outrage after claiming it is often the boys who seduce priests in religious sexual abuse cases. In an interview with the National Catholic Register, Father Benedict Groeschel of the conservative Franciscan Friars of the Renewal, said he did not believe a priest found guilty of sexual absuse should go to jail if it was his first offence. He even went on to describe disgraced Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky as a 'poor guy'. Father Groeschel, an influential voice in the American catholic community, has written several books and appears weekly on a religious television network. He said: 'People have this picture in their minds of a person planning to [be] a psychopath. 'But that’s not the case. Suppose you have a man having a nervous breakdown, and a youngster comes after him. A lot of the cases, the youngster — 14, 16, 18 — is the seducer.' He added: 'Here’s this poor guy Sandusky it went on for years. Interesting: Why didn’t anyone say anything? Apparently, a number of kids knew about it and didn’t break the ice. 'Well, you know, until recent years, people did not register in their minds that it was a crime. It was a moral failure, scandalous; but they didn’t think of it in terms of legal things.' 'If you go back 10 or 15 years ago with different sexual difficulties — except for rape or violence — it was very rarely brought as a civil crime.' Asked to clarify his commenst he went on to suggest that most of these 'relationships' are heterosexual in nature, which historically have not been thought of as a crime. He said: 'If you go back 10 or 15 years ago with different sexual difficulties — except for rape or violence — it was very rarely brought as a civil crime. Nobody thought of it that way. 'Sometimes statutory rape would be — but only if the girl pushed her case. Parents wouldn’t touch it. People backed off, for years, on sexual cases. I’m not sure why. 'I think perhaps part of the reason would be an embarrassment, that it brings the case out into the open, and the girl’s name is there, or people will figure out what’s there, or the youngster involved — you know, it’s not put in the paper, but everybody knows; they’re talking about it. 'At this point, any priest, any clergyman, any social worker, any teacher, any responsible person in society would become involved in a single sexual act — not necessarily intercourse — they’re done. 'And I’m inclined to think, on their first offense, they should not go to jail because their intention was not committing a crime.' But Father Groeschel's comments immediately prompted a string of angry posts. 'Poor guy': Father Groeschel suggested disgraced Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky was a victim . One anonymous writer raged: 'Those comments on abuse make me shiver.  I really really hope he doesn't actually think the way he explained things in those answers. 'Jerry Sandusky is a monster and the image people have in their mind when his name comes up is that of an evil pervert committing unspeakable acts on an innocent 10 year old in a shower.' Another wrote: 'Comments like this about pedophilia take the biscuit. I am disgusted at what I have just read. 'How dare this prominent priest accuse abuse victims of acting as seducers! You can NEVER justify or condone pedophilia. It is a disordered and depraved act. God forgive you for your comments!' Siginificantly The National Catholic Register is a publication affiliated with the disgraced Legion of Christ religious order. The legion, which in 1995 helped saved the National Catholic Register from closing, was involved in one of the most damaging Catholic sexual abuse scandals of recent times. Its former leader, the Rev. Marcial Maciel, who had close links to Pope John Paul II, had been investigated for a string of sexual abuse claims since the mid 1950s. In 2005, the Vatican was dragged into disrepute after it emerged Maciel had been abusing seminarians for year.

"Mitt Romney has jokingly told supporters that he has never been asked to produce his birth certificate, as President Barack Obama has, because everyone knows that he and his wife are from Michigan. There were gasps from reporters and laughs and cheers from the crowd of thousands as Romney, in an ill-judged attempt at humour, gave Democrats the opening to portray him as subscribing to the ‘Birther’ conspiracy theory that Obama is not an American. ‘No one has ever asked to see my birth certificate,’ Romney said. ‘They know that this was the place that we were born and raised.’ Joke? Mitt Romney told supporters that he has never been asked to produce his birth certificate, as President Barack Obama has, because everyone knows that he and his wife are from Michigan . There was an immediate, indignant . response from the Obama campaign. Ben LaBolt, campaign spokesman, said . in a statement: ‘Throughout this campaign, Governor Romney has embraced . the most strident voices in his party instead of standing up to them. ‘It’s one thing to give the stage in . Tampa to Donald Trump, Sheriff Arpaio, and Kris Kobach. But Governor . Romney’s decision to directly enlist himself in the birther movement . should give pause to any rational voter across America.’ Romney was telling the crowd in Commerce, Michigan on Friday that he and wife Ann had been born in hospitals nearby. ‘Now I love being home in this place where Ann and I were raised, where both of us were born. Ann was born in Henry Ford Hospital,’ he said. ‘I was born in Harper Hospital.' Campaigning: US Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney (2nd L) and his running mate Paul Ryan greet supporters during a campaign event at a farm in Commerce, Michigan, today . It was then that he said that he had never been asked to show his birth certificate. The quip was an obvious reference to the theory propounded on the Right-wing fringe that Obama was not born in Hawaii, as a newspaper notice at the time and the long-form birth certificate produced by the White House show, but in Kenya. For Romney, the subject is a perilous one because many independent voters view such theories as racist and an attempt to de-legitimise America’s first black president. Romney is more vulnerable on the issue than many other Republicans because he publicly accepted the endorsement of Donald Trump, the billionaire property mogul and reality television star, who is an outspoken proponent of Birther theories. At the time, Romney said he did not . agree with Trump on Birtherism. ‘You know, I don't agree with all the . people who support me and my guess is they don't all agree with . everything I believe in. But I need to get 50.1 per cent or more and I'm . appreciative to have the help of a lot of good people.' Kevin . Madden, a Romney spokesman, immediately sought to downplay the comment, . saying that ‘the governor's been clear on this issue many times before’ and viewed it as settled. Proof is in the papers: Mr Obama released his birth certificate last April to try and quiet a debate within Republican circles that he was not born in the country . ‘The governor has always said, and has repeatedly said, he believes the president was born here in the United States. He was only referencing that Michigan, where he is campaigning today, is the state where he himself was born and raised.’ LaBolt’s mention of Arpaio and Kobach was an attempt to link Romney to two of the most controversial figures on the Republican right. Arpaio is the Arizona sheriff who calls himself ‘America’s toughest sheriff’ and has gained notoriety for his determination to round up and arrest illegal immigrants. Arpaio has also called into question Obama’s citizenship and carried out an investigation that concluded his long-form birth certificate was a forgery. Kobach is the Kansas secretary of state who has filed a lawsuit challenging Obama’s directive that illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children by their parents should be allowed to stay in the country. The claim that Obama is not a natural-born citizen of the US and is therefore not eligible for the presidency sprung up during the 2008 election campaign, when his official birth certificate was released by his aides. There have been various theories put forward – that he was born in Kenya or that he became an Indonesian as a child or that he was a dual citizen at birth. A number of lawsuits have been brought on the issue, to no avail. Conclusion: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio . announced on Tuesday, July 17, 2012, in Phoenix that President Obama's . birth certificate, as presented by the White House in April 2011, is a . forgery based on an investigation by the Sheriff's office . In April last year, the White House released Obama’s long-form birth certificate after polls suggested that at least a quarter of Americans were unsure where he was born. During the early stages of the Republican primary campaign, Trump, who said he was weighing candidacy, gained traction in the polls by alleging Obama was not born in the U.S. Romney advisers said that his joke was unplanned. But many Obama supporters were quick to suggest that it was a dog whistle to racists and an attempt to whip up anger. Republicans were quick to say that an Obama adviser had suggested Romney was a felon and a super PAC campaign ad linked him to the death of a woman who succumbed to cancer. At best, Romney’s joke was a tactical blunder because it undermined his promise to run a substantive campaign about big issues and took the focus of the campaign away from what voters care about most – jobs and the economy. Mitt Romney was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1947 and his wife Ann in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan in 1949. Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1961 and Donald Trump in Queens, New York in 1946.","Mitt Romney said everyone knows he and his wife are from Michigan .

"Ever questioned whether the moon landings were faked, whether aliens really crash landed at Roswell or whether there was more to the Kennedy assassination than Lee Harvey Oswald and a lone rifle? Your view on popular conspiracy theories depends on your political affiliation, according to new findings. A study of registered voters in the US has found that whether you believe in Bigfoot or think that global warming is a myth depends on which side of the political fence you sit. Contentious: Opinion was almost literally split in half when US voters were asked whether they though there was a bigger force than Lee Harvey Oswald, right, acting alone in the 1963 assassination of John F Kennedy, left . Sceptics: You're more likely to be a Democrat than a Republican if you think the Moon landings were faked . According to the poll, carried out by the Public Policy Institute, when it comes to some of the most famous conspiracy theories out there, American opinion is split right along party lines. While a staggering 37 per cent of those surveyed overall believe that global warming is a hoax, it is more likely that you are a Republican if you hold that view. For almost 60 per cent of Republicans asked thought that the phenomenon was made up while just 11 per cent of Democrats polled agreed. Republicans are also more likely to believe that aliens crash landed at Roswell in 1947. Around a fifth of those surveyed in total believe that particular conspiracy theory, but just 18 per cent of Democrats believe that a flying saucer came down in New Mexico, compared to 27 per cent of Republicans asked. About 35 percent of Republicans and Independents believe a secretive group of worldwide elite are trying to set up a totalitarian government known as the New World Order. But that number falls to just 15 per cent if you quiz a Democrat. Party politics: Naturally, more Republicans believe that Democrat President Barack Obama, left, is the anti-christ than his own party's supporters, but more Democrats believe that George W Bush misled the US over Saddam Hussein's WMDs stock than Republicans . Unsurprisingly, political affiliation influenced voters' opinions on a number of conspiracy theories involving the US's two most recent leaders. Asked if current White House incumbent Barack Obama is the anti-Christ, a fifth of Republicans said yes compared to a meagre six per cent of those polled who support President Obama's Democratic party. And when it comes to the Iraq war and whether Republican ex-President George W Bush misled Americans over Saddam Hussein's WMDs, more than 70 per cent of Democrats say that he did and just 13 per cent of Republicans agree. And questioned if former Iraqi leader Hussein was connected with the 9/11 terrorist attacks, just over a fifth of Democrats think he was compared to a third of Republicans. Former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . Conspiracy? The twin towers of the World Trade Center pour smoke in New York in this September 11, 2001. Many Americans believe Saddam Hussein was involved in the attacks . But when it comes to some of history's most debated theories, opinion seems to be more divided regardless of political persuasion. Around seven per cent of Americans believe that the 1969 moon landings were faked, with seven per cent of Democrats quizzed believing that the iconic images of Neil Armstrong taking one giant leap were mocked up, and four per cent of Republicans holding similar views. Just over half of those polled believe that there was a wider conspiracy involved in the 1963 assassination of President John F Kennedy, with both Democrats and Republicans split almost 50/50 in their views. And around 15 per cent of both Democrats and Republicans believe in Bigfoot. Some of the more bizarre conspiracies bought by voters include the idea that Sir Paul McCartney died in 1965 and was replaced by a lookalike so that the Beatles could carry on with their chart success - five per cent believe that is true - with nine per cent worried that the Government is adding fluoride to the water deliberately for sinister means and, surprisingly, four per cent believing in lizard people. Staggering: Five per cent of US voters believe that Paul McCartney, left, died in 1965 and was replaced by a lookalike in the Beatles .","Republicans more likely to believe that global warming is a hoax .

"A blind pensioner determined not to be a burden on his family jumped into a harbour and drowned shortly after learning he had cancer. Coastguards and paramedics desperately tried to save Reg White, 97, a former sailor from Aberystwyth, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. He was spotted going into the harbour near the lifeboat slipway at around 3.30pm last Wednesday. Popular Reg White, pictured with son Brian, drowned after doctors gave him his diagnosis . Mr White jumped into the harbour six days after leaving hospital, where he had stayed for six weeks after doctors discovered he had cancer. One of Mr White's two sons, Brian, who runs an art shop in Pier Street, said: 'My dad was well-known and well-liked. 'He lived a full life and had his independence right to the end. 'He had been in hospital the last six weeks and was very agitated when he came out and I don't think he would have wanted to be a burden or lose his independence.' Mr White, who was registered blind, had been a sailor in the Merchant Navy in the Second World War, and went on to work as a master painter and decorator. Mr White, who was registered blind, had been a sailor in the Merchant Navy in the Second World War, and went on to work as a master painter . Mr White was spotted going into the harbour near the lifeboat slipway at around 3.30pm last Wednesday . Described by friends as 'very skilful and knowledgeable', he was an expert knot-tyer, who could make beautiful arts and crafts from rope, made ships in bottles, and also previously played the guitar in several local bands. Until three months ago, Mr White was still cycling to the supermarket, despite losing his sight. The family said they wanted to pay tribute to those who tried to save Mr White. 'We would like to thank the rescue services for their efforts and the hospital staff during his recent stay,' said Brian White. 'I know my dad wouldn't have liked to impose on those who had to get him out of the water.' He went on to work as a master painter and decorator, but always retained his love of the sea, being a member of the Lifeboat and Coastguard crews in Aberystwyth in the 1950s and '60s. Though he had been registered blind 10 . years ago, Mr White could still make out shapes and cycled to Morrisons . regularly up until three months ago.

'Reg would come down the harbour twice a day or walk up to the benches and sit and talk to people,' he said. 'He'd always been a keen sailor and taught me a lot when we used to go out in the boat together. 'His health and eyesight had been failing recently but he always had time for a chat and was well liked down at the harbour. I'll miss him greatly.' Town councillor Mair Benjamin lives on the next street to Mr White and said he was 'well loved and would be truly missed in the community'. A sailor with the Merchant Navy for . many years, including the Second World War, Mr White was once adrift in . the Indian Ocean for weeks after the crankshaft broke on his ship.

"The year’s first Grand Slam sees Andy Murray with a new kit, a new personal logo, a slimmed-down support team, pain-free and engaged to be married. And, as he insisted during a break in preparation for the Australian Open, which starts on Monday, he also feels unencumbered by a surrounding atmosphere he felt may have held him back in 2014. It was an unusual sight to see him practising without Dani Vallverdu, who — along with trainer Jez Green — departed in the off-season, the former to work with Tomas Berdych. Andy Murray (left) recently parted ways with trainer Jez Green (right) Murray also split with another of his coaching staff in Dani Vallverdu (right) Murray said he had different ideas on how to progress compared to Green and Vallverdu . They had been through a lot and achieved much together, but it is becoming clear how much their harmony had deteriorated in the wake of Ivan Lendl leaving and being replaced by Amelie Mauresmo. Murray referred to ‘moving together in one direction’ so often that it sounded like the topic might have been boy bands rather than the split from two of his most trusted lieutenants. ‘When I sat down with Dani and Jez at the end of the year it was clear they had different views on things and what they wanted to do,’ said Murray, who meets a qualifier in the first round. ‘I didn’t really agree with them and that’s why things ended up changing. ‘When you’re actually playing tournaments you’re not discussing every little thing, but when you look back at the year and the last few months I would say the atmosphere within the team wasn’t particularly good. ‘It’s not helpful for anyone when it’s like that and that hadn’t always been the case, we had a very good relationship for most of the time. When things aren’t going well and you look back and the atmosphere hasn’t been good, it affects how everybody works. ‘The atmosphere is good now. When the people around you are pulling in the same direction it’s beneficial and hopefully that will mean some good performances.’ It is clear that, aside from the passage of time — which can fray any good coaching relationship — one of the areas of disagreement involved training methods. Murray and Matt Little, the trainer now working full-time with him, have been focusing more on speed and slightly less on the hard yards in the gym. Murray (left) pictured in training ahead of the Australian Open as coach Amelie Mauresmo (right) watches on . Murray feels that he is in good shape going into the first major championship of the year . He already feels it is paying a dividend and performances in his first two, albeit unofficial, tournaments of the year have banished the memory of that 6-0, 6-1 loss to Roger Federer at the O2 Arena in November. ‘I have never moved as well at the beginning of a year,’ he said. ‘Coming into the Australian Open last year I did loads of fitness, too much, probably. I trained almost every day for three months and you could say I was very fit but I was tired as well. ‘When I was playing matches I was waking up sore and stiff so I wasn’t necessarily match fit, whereas now I feel in good match shape. My first match of the year was long but I woke up with no issues. I feel strong and balanced. I have been doing a lot more speed work on the court. I have been working a lot on my movement in the off-season — three, four days a week. That isn’t something I have done much of over the last few years. ‘I feel that my speed around the court is a huge strength and something I should work on and try to get better at, because when I move well around the court, even when I am not playing good tennis, I can still find ways to win matches.’ He is also clearly of a mind to prove wrong those who question whether Mauresmo is the right person to restore him to the status of Grand Slam winner. Murrayhits a return during a training session as he prepares for the Australian Open . Murray unveiled his own logo this week and it will be launched at the Australian Open in 2015 . Andy Murray says he will leave the wedding planning to fiancee Kim Sears. A word of warning — when engaged to Kim Clijsters, former world No 1 Lleyton Hewitt declared: ‘I’ll just rock up. She can organise it.’ Nine months later the pair split amid rumours of a dispute over the organising of their big day. ‘You can’t judge how a relationship is working with someone based on a few events, you have to look over an extended period of time,’ he said. ‘In the off- season it has been the first time I have got to spend a good amount of time on the court with her to consistently work on things.’ The sense is that he is excited about his prospects, in contrast to 12 months ago when he was nervous about how his back would hold up following surgery. There is also the anticipation of his nuptials later this year, although he is leaving much of the arranging to fiancee Kim Sears, saying: ‘I try to stay out of all that. I just agree with Kim on most things. The only thing I will be involved in is the food — that is what I am particularly interested in. The rest is on Kim.’ Murray (left) is engaged to Kim Sears (right) but is letting her plan the wedding . Yesterday’s draw has kept him in the opposite half to strong favourite Novak Djokovic but there could be a fourth-round meeting with world No 11 Grigor Dimitrov, who knocked him out of the Wimbledon quarter-finals last year. And in the last eight Murray is due to meet Federer, so there is plenty of scope for avenging some of the disappointments of 2014. James Ward will face world No 33 Fernando Verdasco while Heather Watson, who overnight was attempting to win her second WTA title at the Hobart International, is up against world No 67 Tsvetana Pironkova. Britons Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady were involved in the last round of qualifying.","Andy Murray in positive spirits ahead of Australian Open challenge .

"Rep. Paul Ryan said Saturday that Republicans need to stick together and pick their fights during President Barack Obama's second term, rejecting some White House proposals outright and trying to infuse others with conservative principles. In a speech to conservatives, the GOP's 2012 vice presidential nominee said Obama would attempt to divide Republicans but urged them to avoid internal squabbles after a second straight presidential loss. 'We can't get rattled. We won't play the villain in his morality plays. We have to stay united,' Ryan said at the National Review Institute's weekend conference on the future of conservatism. 'We have to show that if given the chance, we can govern. We have better ideas.' United front: Paul Ryan looks rueful at the inauguration of President Obama on January 21. 'We can't get rattled. We won't play the villain in his morality plays,' he told conservatives . The Wisconsin congressman outlined a pragmatic approach for a party dealing with last November's election defeats and trying to determine whether to oppose Obama's agenda at every turn or shape his proposals with conservative principles. How the party moves forward was a major theme of the three-day meeting of conservative activists who also heard from Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Govs. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Bob McDonnell of Virginia were scheduled to address the conference on Sunday. The theme also dominated the Republican National Committee's winter meeting, which ended Friday in Charlotte, N.C. With a surging minority population altering the electorate, Republican leaders have discussed the need to attract more women and Hispanics while at the same time standing firm on the values that unite conservatives. Republicans said despite the losses, the party could return to power by projecting optimism and attracting new voters with a message of economic opportunity. President Barack Obama gives his inauguration address. Republican congressman for Wisconsin, Paul Ryan, said he plans to battle Obama and promote conservatism with 'every tool at our disposal' Walker, a star among conservatives after surviving a union-led campaign to recall him from office, said government needed 'brown-bag common sense,' a reference to his frugal practice of packing his own lunch of ham-and-cheese sandwiches every day. Qualities like optimism, staying relevant to voters and showing courage in tackling big problems would be rewarded at the voting booth, he said. 'We've got to learn to be more optimistic. We've got to learn to give a viable alternative to the voters,' Walker said. Cruz said Republicans needed to use upcoming fights over the budget and the deficit as 'leverage points' to tame long-term spending and debt. Projecting an upbeat outlook for the party, he said Obama's policies would drive many voters to Republicans just as many Americans turned to Ronald Reagan after the economic turmoil of the late 1970s. 'We're on the verge of a rebirth of conservativism,' Cruz said. Ryan said he was 'disappointed' at last year's election results but was able to joke about his failure to become vice president. 'My kids were looking forward to having a pool,' he said . Looking ahead, Ryan rejected the notion that Republicans were 'in the wilderness,' noting that the party controls the House and most statehouses. But he said Obama's victory over Romney meant that Republicans would need to recalibrate their approach to deal with the new political realities. 'If we want to promote conservatism, we'll need to use every tool at our disposal,' Ryan said. 'Sometimes, we will have to reject the president's proposals - that time may come more than once. And sometimes we'll have to make them better.' He said Republicans should have two main goals for the next four years, namely 'to mitigate bad policies' and 'to advance good policy wherever we can.' Ryan acknowledged that 'we all didn't see eye to eye' on the recent 'fiscal cliff' vote to deal with a combination of spending cuts and higher taxes that were set to take effect at the start of the year. He defended his support for the bill, saying it was the only way to avoid sweeping tax increases and prevent the economy from going into a free-fall. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan said Republicans needed to guard against a debt crisis for the country that would undermine the economy. He said he would promote changes to Medicare and Medicaid and would propose a budget 'that will balance and pay down the debt.' But November's election results still linger. Ryan said he was 'disappointed' by the outcome, saying he was 'looking forward to taking on the big challenges' while living at the vice president's residence. 'My kids were looking forward to having a pool,' he joked.","Former GOP vice presidential nominee says the party must stay together against Obama .

"It's still rolling. The red paint may have been chipped, the bodywork a bit bashed up and the foot has perhaps eased on the accelerator ever so slightly. But the juggernaut keeps moving along. The notion that a home draw with Dundee could possibly be construed as a point gained by the Dons would have seemed faintly absurd before kick-off. Eight straight league wins without conceding tends to offer that kind of all-or-nothing perspective. By the time Ryan Jack bundled home the sixth and final goal of an enthralling match deep into injury time, though, no one was thinking of two points lost - save the sizeable, shell-shocked Dark Blue contingent of course. David Goodwillie (left) celebrates his goal for Aberdeen against Dundee with striker Adam Rooney . Two goals behind with three minutes of regulation time to play, the salvation of the match from the league leaders was every bit as remarkable as the fact they had not bludgeoned Dundee into submission by the time half-an-hour had elapsed. It was a captivating, bizarre afternoon. The kind of day when neither laughing nor crying seemed appropriate for either manager. Once breath had been drawn, Derek McInnes was closer to the former, with Paul Hartley, his opposite number, solemnly scratching around for positives. There were many of those. Dundee were magnificent in patches, most notably in the 10 minutes before half-time when Gary Irvine and Greg Stewart finished excellent team moves to cancel out David Goodwillie’s opener. They were efficient and effective for much of the second period and not ill-deserving of the deflection that took Gary Harkins’ volley beyond Scott Brown to make it 3-1 - only to wilt at the end when their leaden feet became planted in their own box. Dundee's Kevin Thomson (right) tries to evade the challenge of Aberdeen Peter Pawlett . You could only admire Aberdeen’s steadfast refusal to bow down to the seemingly inevitable. Invigorated by the late introductions of Willo Flood, Cammy Smith and, most tellingly, Lawrence Shankland, they strained every sinew to restore parity with two late goals. A crowd of nigh on 17,000 inside Pittodrie bellowed its approval at their favourites’ indefatigability. If this goes down as a bad day at the office by recent standards, then they will take them now and again. It almost goes without saying that, if hopes of the title are to remain alive, they won’t want to be emulating Harry Houdini too often but, occasionally, such acts of escapology are necessary. Shankland, a 19-year-old contemporary of Andrew Robertson from their Queen’s Park days, was the unlikely hero of the hour. Aberdeen's Peter Pawlett (left) battles for the ball with Dundee's Kevin Thomson o Saturday . Thrown from the bench to replace Adam Rooney with seven minutes remaining, he repeatedly displayed that most coveted of striking habits - being in the right place at the right time. Having made sure Kostadin Gadzhalov clipped his ankles to allow Jonny Hayes to score from the spot on 87 minutes, he then teed up Jack with a headed flick in the second of four added-on minutes to win a point that was celebrated as fervently as any last-gasp victory. The Dons may have had their lead at the top over Celtic cut to two points but, as Dundee found to their cost, their grasp of the meaning of the word defeat is becoming increasingly flimsy. ‘We all believed,’ said Shankland. ‘You never give up in a game and there were still a lot of minutes to go. Ten minutes is enough to score two goals, as we showed. We are delighted to get the draw in the end.’ The expected script was being rigidly adhered to when Goodwillie smashed Rooney’s cross high beyond Scott Bain inside seven minutes, the goal stemming from Niall McGinn picking Irvine’s pocket. Dundee's Greg Stewart runs off in celebration with his arms aloft after he scores against Aberdeen . For the next 20 minutes, the only debate seemed the margin of Aberdeen’s victory. Rooney somehow missed a pinch from three yards after Hayes’ initial shot had been blocked by a defender, Jack’s strike flew a yard wide and Dundee just couldn’t get up for air. Then, remarkably, having not lost a league goal in 757 minutes, the Dons conceded two in 180 seconds. Irvine redeemed himself with a lung-bursting run and a splendid finish to a sweeping six-pass move. Then, before calm could be restored, Stewart marched onto Luka Tankulic’s sumptuous flick and artfully found the bottom corner with the outside of his boot. Had Rooney found the net and not the base of the post two minutes after the restart, the game may have veered in a different direction but, as it was, Harkins’ fearsome volley, which nipped the leg of Ash Taylor, a minute later set the hare racing. If question marks were raised about whether Aberdeen were about to suffer a serious blow to their aspirations, there seemed no doubt about the validity of Alan Muir’s spot-kick award, which Hayes just about squeezed past the Dundee keeper and, from that moment on, the visitors were on the ropes. Dundee's Greg Stewart scores for his side to put them 2-1 up against Aberdeen . Shay Logan’s speculative cross was helped on by Shankland and Jack’s gamble paid off handsomely as he bundled the ball home from a matter of two yards. Every title-winning team enjoys such moments of relief. McInnes stated afterwards that it could be a huge point for his side but was characteristically elusive when pressed on exactly what it could mean in the final reckoning. Improvement - whether week by week or season on season - remains the mantra of those inside Pittodrie. Shankland, the scorer of 19 goals for the development team this season, is certainly growing in stature and is the kind of livewire presence that suggests the depth of McInnes’ squad is very much in keeping with that of a genuine title contender. ‘We looked out of it at the end, but I managed to get two assists,’ beamed the 19-year-old Glaswegian. ‘The manager sent me on and told me to do what I could. He said: “You have got your minutes on the pitch, so go and do what you can.” ‘The gaffer wants me to score goals and that is my job as a striker. I have not managed to score, but I got the assists, so I am happy. ‘I am confident. I try to get myself into good positions on the pitch and, hopefully, I can put one in.’ Not quite confident enough yet to spot the ball for the penalty he won, however. ‘No, there are a few experienced boys and I left it to them,’ smiled Shankland. ‘Jonny took it well, to be fair.’ Despite the formidable figures of Goodwillie and Rooney standing ahead of him in the queue for a starting berth, in Jack - again invaluable to the Dons’ cause here - Shankland sees a road map to regular involvement. ‘We have a really strong squad and the strikers have been doing really well and scoring goals,’ he said. ‘They have created a lot for the team and so I had to be patient, work hard in training and, when I get my chance, I know I have to have as much impact on the game as I can. ‘Jacko is a good player and we have a lot of them at the club. They have taken their chance when it has come along and that is what I need to do to get myself into the team.’ And so to McDiarmid Park on Friday. Shorn of Taylor for around a month after the defender hobbled off with a knee complaint around the hour mark, McInnes will have to move his pieces around the board and re-strategise. But they are still in the game.","Aberdeen drew 3-3 at home to Dundee in SPL on Saturday .

"If anyone's going to twerk it, it's the dancers at London's Notting Hill Carnival this bank holiday weekend. And to help the rest of us shape up and shake our booty like the pros, Red Bull has released a 'how to' video demonstrating some of the must-have moves. In the video a bunch of Londoners take to the camera wiggling their posteriors in the spirit of carnival that will see jerk chicken and twerk dancing in abundance. The dancers limber up for the big twerk out by flexing their muscles in figure-hugging outfits before letting all hell loose on the dance floor. They work through a series of moves including the Big N Nasty, Tempa Wine and Bruk It Down that the rest of us can only dream of copying. No matter, with a beach for the video back drop, there's no stopping the dancers as they get into the spirit of the Caribbean festivity. The annual event has taken place since 1966 and is led by members of the West Indian community.

"Have you ever wondered the amount of organisation that goes into safely guiding aircraft across our skies? Following up on our last video which focused on Europe, we now take our attention to the North Atlantic, which is often referred to as ‘the gateway to Europe’. Every day, between two and three thousand aircraft fly between Canada, the United States and Europe. And this stunning video, created by NATS (the National Air Traffic Services),  shows every single airplane that went through the five . major air spaces over the North Atlantic during a 24 hour period in August last year, but condensed to two minutes. The video tracks the movement of flights over the course of 24 hours - highlighting the complexity of the routes and how they manage to fly across the continent without crashing into each other. Scroll down for video . Flight path video: The North Atlantic is one of the most popular routes in the world . This visualisation from data visualisation experts 422 South shows 2,524 flights crossing the North Atlantic, of which 1,273 pass . through the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area. At its busiest traffic can peak at 1,500 . flights a day in the summer. NATS, from its control centre in Prestwick, is responsible for providing the air traffic control service to the Shanwick OCA, which is the busiest of all North Atlantic Airspace regions. Around 80% of all North Atlantic Air Traffic passes through it, demonstrating the strategic importance of Prestwick Centre and UK airspace. Paul Beauchamp, NATS spokesman said: “Airspace is an incredibly valuable asset – just as important as the rail, road and utility networks that everyone relies on everyday. ‘However, most people aren’t aware of the work that goes into managing and safely guiding aircraft through our skies. ‘That’s why we created this visualisation to highlight the complexity of that work, the skill of our air traffic controllers and the UK’s strategic importance as the aviation gateway to Europe and North America.’ Data visualisation experts 422 South combined 24 hours worth of flight radar data from all UK flights on one of the busiest days of last year, and blended it with flight schedules and routing information for the rest of Europe – reaching out into the North Atlantic. Computer artists used specially developed programmes to convert the longitude, latitude and height data into luminous dots, which were accurately positioned over satellite images of Britain and mainland Europe, by day and by night.

European maze of air traffic: Video shows the extent of precision planning that is needed every day to ensure the safety of airplanes . Beauchamp continued: 'European airspace is some of the busiest and most complex anywhere in the world. Every day thousands of air traffic controllers guide millions of passengers safely to their destinations. 'Yet to most people, the choreography going on above them is entirely unnoticed - it quite literally goes over their heads. Some might say that is how it should be. 'But, that ignores one very important point.

"From the lack of leg room to annoying reclining seats, the frustrations for plane passengers travelling long-haul in economy class seats have been well documented. So one award-winning designer is taking it into his own hands to encourage airlines to improve comfort for travellers. James Lee, who has won accolades for his forward-thinking concepts, has revealed his plans for new long-haul seats with Hong Kong-based company Paperclip Design. Scroll down for video . The new-look plane seats would have reclining backrests - that don't bump into the passenger sitting behind . Multi-function: The new tray table would double-up as a tablet holder, large enough to fit an iPad . Future concept: James Lee's designs would see economy planes equipped with dual-use armrests . And those travelling on a budget will welcome the new-look, as it's designed with economy passengers in mind. As well as seats with a reclining backrest and a tray with a tablet stand, holidaymakers will also be able to relax on flights with a footrest under the chair in front of them. Potentially spelling the end to elbow wars among travellers sitting next to each other, Lee's Meerkat seat concept also includes a dual-use armrest. End of elbow wars? The new-look seats would have a dual-use armrest which passengers could share . Comfort: James Lee's Meerkat concept includes a footrest for passengers travelling economy class . The design allows both passengers to use it - with a raised front so that space isn't restricted and that neighbours' arms don't touch. The sleeper backrest seats offer an alternative to traditional recliner mode to allow passengers to relax - and could mean the end to passengers' knees being crushed. The lower portion of the backrest cushion detaches, pushing the traveller forward in a 'deep recline' position, allowing them to stretch their legs out in front. And the tablet stand works when the tray is locked in a half-open position, with enough room to support an iPad or tablet on the grooves in the edge of the stand. Future design: The cup holder on planes would be separate to the tray, meaning tables could be stowed away . Seats would have compartments for sunglasses and water bottles - taking away the full-width seat pocket . Entertainment: The dual-use armrest would feature a hook for headphones - making them easier to stow away . Lee's design plans also include a fixed cup holder - meaning the tray could be stowed away - a personal cabinet below the table, replacing the seat pocket, and a box footrest - in which airlines could store electronics. The designer, who has won various prices in the travel industry, said he also sought to address airline's cost concerns when compiling the concept. Explaining the design, the website said: 'The Meerkat is a concept design for long haul economy class seating that enhances passenger experience while minimising weight and maintenance costs. Adaptable: Paperclip Design's Caterpillar Convertible seat can work in both the economy and business cabins . 'Passengers today are far more focused on comfort. 'However, airlines need to balance costs with fancy facilities. Weight reduction is especially critical since it has a direct bearing on the amount of fuel consumed particularly on long flights. 'The Meerkat seeks to satisfy both sides. 'It introduces a number of innovative features with minimal weight and complexity. The Meerkat is a seat for passengers as well as a seat for airlines.' Elbow room: The Paperclip design means that both passengers can use the armrest . Versatile: James Lee hopes that his design will be incorporated into both aircraft and trains . Other designs by Lee were unveiled at this year's influential Aircraft Interiors Expo, held in Hamburg in northern Germany. The imaginative ‘Caterpillar Convertible’ seat – which has already won awards thanks to its versatility - was also mooted. Futuristic and flexible, the Caterpillar can be both a cheaper seating option in the economy cabin – or can be reconfigured as something rather more exclusive in business class, with the capacity to spread out as a flat bed. And Lee has won awards for his two-teared armrest and now, after patenting the product in the UK and US, he is hoping the idea will catch on for planes, trains and even cinemas.","Award-winning designer James Lee's concept improves passenger seating .

"Holidaymakers are being given a sneak peek inside what’s in store for them on board Royal Caribbean’s newest ship, Quantum of the Seas, in a new video. Teaming up with author and TV presenter Jason Bradbury, the cruise line's footage reveals passengers will be able to enjoy skydiving, a 300ft-high observation deck, and first-at-sea entertainment. In the two-minute clip, Bradbury takes viewers on a technological tour on what is being billed as ‘the world’s most futuristic and advanced ship’, set to launch on November 23. The North Star, set to launch this November, will carry as many as 13 guests at a time . World first: Concerts on board Quantum of the Seas will be projected on to screens in Two70 . The C5 Gadget Show host, who’s a ‘self-confessed geek’, showcases the ‘ground-breaking technology and new entertainment offerings’ – including ‘things that have never been tried on a cruise ship before’. The 4,180-passenger ship will boast an iFLY skydiving experience on board, of which Bradbury says: ‘Skydiving on board a ship; isn't that astonishing.’ The cruise line, which already boasts zip lines, real trees, boxing rings and the world's first sea bound amphitheatre on board its ships, is also launching the North Star: a jewel-shaped, glass capsule. Quantum of the Seas: How the brand new ship will look featuring the North Star . 'Astonishing': Passengers will be able to try skydiving in the iFly experience on board Quantum of the Seas . Unrivalled entertainment: Two70 will transform at night with 100ft-wide windows forming the backdrop for gigs . The bubble-like structure, which was inspired by the London Eye, will give those brave enough to be hoisted high above the ocean incredible 360-degree views, lifting as many as 13 guests at a time. Bradbury says: ‘It's basically a pod that carries you 300ft above the deck of a while at sea or at port, giving you a completely unique perspective.’ Talking about Quantum of the Sea’s ‘futuristic approach to entertainment’, Bradbury says the best example is Two70°. As well as boasting stunning 270-degree, the room will be used for concerts and performances, which will also involve ‘robotic’ screens – which move independently or together -  and be projected onto 100ft-wide windows over 20ft high – which has never been done before. Guests will have the chance to rollerskate - or try out bumper cars - in the transforming SeaPlex area . The North Star: The orb-like structure was based on the London Eye . 'Tech geek': Channel 5 Gadget Show presenter Jason Bradbury hosts the new video . He adds: ‘This is a space you can go to in the day and get this beautiful 270-degree vista, but if you go back there in the evening, it's like you've walked into a completely different place.’ Speaking about the vessel, which boasts 18 decks and weighs 167,800 registered tonnes, Bradbury adds: ‘The technology on board this ship is extraordinary. ‘This is an absolute game changer and will completely revolutionise the way we holiday.’ Other new features, which will be free to all passengers, include The Sea-Plex, the largest indoor sports and entertainment complex at sea with bumper cars, a simulated skydiving experience, a version of the line's popular FlowRider surfing simulator, and 'virtual balconies' - video screens that provide streaming views of the ship's surroundings to interior cabins. The Quantum of the Seas will also have Jamie's Italian restaurants, new 'family connected' staterooms are designed to offer more flexibility for multi-generational travel and 'studio' staterooms, especially for single travellers.","Cruise line teams up with 'self-confessed geek' Jason Bradbury for video .
