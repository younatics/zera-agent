Tragic: Richard Stanton and Rhiannon Davies lost their daughter Kate after failings by NHS staff which led to the baby being born in a midwifery unit rather than a hospital . The death of a newborn baby could have been avoided if the child had been born in a hospital rather than a midwives unit, an inquest has ruled. A couple slammed the NHS after losing their tiny daughter just six hours after she was born, claiming she should have had better treatment. Kate Seren Stanton-Davies died on March 1, 2009, after suffering from a rare pregnancy condition in which blood leaks from the foetus into the mother. Her mother Rhiannon Davies, 38, a technical writer from Ludlow, Shrops., suffered complications in the last month of her pregnancy which lead to a series of hospital trips and tests. Just two hours after being born at Ludlow Community Hospital, tiny Kate suffered a collapse and was flown by the West Midlands Air Ambulance to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital where she died at 4.05pm the same day. On Friday, an inquest jury at South Shropshire Coroners' Court unanimously concluded that the baby would have survived if she had been delivered elsewhere, and the decision by clinicians to treat Mrs Davies' pregnancy as low risk contributed to Kate's death. Mrs Davies and her husband Mr Stanton, who got married in December last year, described the care given to Kate as 'a complete and utter catastrophe', and say everything which could have gone wrong did. Speaking after the inquest, Mrs Davies said: 'Lessons must be learned and change implemented to ensure no other family has to endure what we have been through. 'Throughout my pregnancy and Kate's birth we, as a family, have been let down by the various organisations within the NHS. 'Knowing what we know now I would never have consented to have given birth at Ludlow maternity unit. 'We have grave concerns about the quality of midwifery care that Kate received after her birth. 'Following the inquest we now know that she was left alone in a cold cot in a hypothermic state with signs of respiratory distress by a midwife who was meant to be caring for her. 'That image haunts us.' Mr Stanton, a professional photographer, told The Sunday Times: 'The hospital trust were, and are responsible for the death of our daughter. Anger: Ludlow Community Hospital where Rhiannon Davies gave birth to her daughter Kate . 'The questions we have been battling to get answered for three years and eight months have finally been answered by a unanimous jury verdict.' After the inquest, Cathy Smith, head of midwifery and deputy centre chief for the women and children's centre at The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, said: 'We will now be taking the time to reflect on the jury's findings.' Ian Cohen, of Goodmans Law, the family's solicitor, told the newspaper: 'Lessons must be learnt, but it is of critical importance that mothers-to-be are fully informed and give full and informed consent.' The inquest also heard of a catalogue of transportation failings in rushing the couple to be with their dying daughter. West Midlands Ambulance Service refused to treat Kate's mother as a priority, and told her she may have to wait up to four hours to be transported to be with her dying daughter. A happier time: Rhiannon Davies, of Ludlow, Shropshire, pictured in her . 36th week of pregnancy, just five weeks prior to the birth of her baby . Kate Seren who died after a collapse . Not wanting to be separated, Mrs Davies and her husband Richard Stanton, 42, decided to drive themselves to Birmingham to find Kate and attempted to follow the helicopter by car. But during the journey, the new mother collapsed from an acute stress reaction, and an emergency ambulance had to be called which, instead of taking her to Birmingham, transferred her to Worcester Hospital instead. Photographer Mr Stanton eventually found out where Kate was being treated having rung around multiple hospitals in the West Midlands desperately trying to find her. He arrived just in time to hold her for the last five minutes of her life, but Mrs Davies did not reach her until 90 minutes after she died. Dr Andrew Carson, medical director for the West Midlands Ambulance Service, commented in a report to the family: 'Logistical and procedural issues within WMAS led to an unsatisfactory experience for this family at a time of great difficulty for them.' In response to this statement Mr Stanton said: 'If one flies with a budget airline one might have an unsatisfactory experience. 'But the fact that it took 58 minutes from the 999 call being made to Kate arriving at Heartlands Hospital, where she died in my arms, makes this comment grossly inappropriate.' A spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service later claimed they did everything they could to save baby Kate. Spokesman Murray MacGregor said: 'The inquest has shown that the care provided by the ambulance crew and the doctor and paramedic on the air ambulance was appropriate and they did everything they could to get Kate to Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham, a Level 3 neonatal unit, in the shortest possible time.' But yesterday, Mr Stanton said he was disgusted with the response the grieving family received from the West Midlands Ambulance Service. He said: 'The ambulance service said the flight time for the air ambulance to get Kate to Heartlands was just 15 minutes. Intimate: Rhiannon Davies just moments after the birth of her baby daughter on March 1 at Ludlow Community Hospital. Tiny Kate died on the same day after she was airlifted to hospital. 'But the inquest heard the actual time from departure to arrival was 58 minutes. 'It's clear to us that by their response they are still in denial that their actions contributed to the suffering of our daughter. 'Ultimately... my daughter would only be alive today if the clinicians from the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust had listened to mine and my wife's concerns about our baby, both before she was delivered and immediately following her birth.'

"By . Associated Press and Kerry Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 03:53 EST, 14 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:17 EST, 14 November 2012 . On trial: Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, seen in 2011, is on trial for the murder of 16 Afghans slain in the early hours of March 11 . Army prosecutors say the U.S. soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan villagers in a murderous rampage must face the death penalty for his 'heinous and despicable crimes'. Attorneys asked the investigative officer overseeing a preliminary hearing to recommend a death penalty court-martial for Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, as they made their closing arguments at the end of a week of testimony. Bales, 39, is accused of slipping away from his remote base at Camp Belambay in southern Afghanistan to attack two villages early on March 11 - nine children were among the dead. The slayings drew such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations in Afghanistan, and it was three weeks before American investigators could reach the crime scenes. 'Terrible, terrible things happened,' said prosecutor Major Rob Stelle. 'That is clear.' Maj. Stelle cited statements Bales made after he was apprehended, saying that they demonstrated 'a clear memory of what he had done, and consciousness of wrong-doing'. Several soldiers testified that Bales returned to the base alone just before dawn, covered in blood, and that he made incriminating statements such as, 'I thought I was doing the right thing'. An attorney for Bales argued that there was not enough information to move forward with the court-martial. 'There are a number of questions that have not been answered so far in this investigation,' attorney Emma Scanlan told the investigating officer overseeing the preliminary hearing. Scanlan said that it is still unknown what Bales' state of mind was the evening of the killings. An Army criminal investigations command special agent had testified last week that Bales tested positive for steroids three days after the killings, and other soldiers testified that Bales had been drinking the evening of the massacre. 'We've heard that Sgt. Bales was lucid, coherent and responsive,' Scanlan said in her closing argument. 'We don't know what it means to be on alcohol, steroids and sleeping aids,' she added. Accused: This courtroom sketch shows Staff Sgt Bales on the final day of his preliminary hearing at Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington, U.S. The investigating officer said at . Tuesday's hearing that he would have a written recommendation by the end . of the week, but that is just the start of the process. 'Terrible, terrible things happened. That is clear' Prosecutor Major Rob Stelle . That recommendation goes next to the . brigade command, and the ultimate decision would be made by the . three-star general on the base. There's no clear sense of how long that could take before a decision is reached on whether to proceed to a court-martial trial. If a court-martial takes place, it . will be held at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, the Washington state base . south of Seattle, and witnesses will be flown in from Afghanistan. The military hasn't executed a service . member since 1961, and none of the six men on death row at Fort . Leavenworth, Kansas, today were convicted for atrocities against foreign . civilians. All of their crimes involved the killing of U.S. civilians or . fellow service members. In the most recent high-profile case . at Joint Base Lewis-McChord before Bales, the Army did not seek a death . penalty court-martial against five soldiers accused of killing three . Afghan civilians for sport. In that case, the ringleader was sentenced . to life in prison with possibility of parole. Bales faces 16 counts of premeditated . murder and six counts of attempted murder. The preliminary hearing, . which began on November 5, included nighttime sessions on Friday, Saturday and . Sunday for the convenience of the Afghan witnesses. Bales did not . testify. 'We are proud to stand by him': The soldier's wife Kari Bales, left, is seen with her sister Stephanie Tandberg, right, outside the military courtroom yesterday . Emma Scanlan, defence attorney for Bales, has said there is insufficient information to move foward with a death penalty court-martial . The witnesses included a seven-year-old . girl, who described how she hid behind her father when a gunman came to . their village that night, how the stranger fired, and how her father . died, cursing in pain and anger. None of the Afghan witnesses were able . to identify Bales as the shooter, but other evidence, including tests . of the blood on his clothes, implicated him, according to testimony from . a DNA expert. After the hearing concluded, Scanlan . spoke with reporters, saying that in addition to questions about Bales' state of mind, there are still questions of whether there were more . people involved. 'We all grieve deeply for the Afghani families who lost their loved ones...but we must all not rush to judgement' Statement from Staff Sgt. Bales' family . Scanlan also raised the issue of . post-traumatic stress disorder and brain injury, noting that Bales had . received a screening at the traumatic brain injury clinic at Madigan . Army Medical Center during a period of time that the center is under . investigation for reversing hundreds of PTSD diagnoses of soldiers since . 2007. 'We're in the process of investigating that,' she said. The attorney refused to confirm if Bales had ever been diagnosed with PTSD. Bales' wife, Kari, and her sister, . Stephanie Tandberg, met with reporters briefly after the hearings . concluded. Ms Tandberg read a statement, saying 'we all grieve deeply for . the Afghani families who lost their loved ones on March 11, but we must . all not rush to judgment'. Last week, the lead prosecutor, Lt. Col. Jay Morse, said on the night of the killings Bales watched a movie . about a former CIA agent on a revenge killing spree, with two fellow . soldiers, while drinking contraband whiskey. Morse said Bales first . attacked one village, Alkozai, returned to the base at Camp Belambay, . then headed out again to attack a second village, Najiban. Bales . returned to the base covered in blood, Morse said, and his incriminating . statements indicate he was 'deliberate and methodical'. In the family statement, Ms Tandberg . said: 'We all want very much to know how, why, and what happened ... Much of the testimony was painful, even heartbreaking, but we are not . convinced the government has shown us the truth, the whole truth, and . nothing but the truth about what happened that night ... We know Bob as . bright, courageous and honorable, as a man who is a good citizen, . soldier, son, husband, father, uncle and sibling. 'We in Bob's family are . proud to stand by him.' Survivor: Sadiquallah, a young boy of about 13 or 14, is sketched left at an earlier hearing during his testimony against Bales, right, after surviving the attack despite a bullet grazing his skull . Home invasion: Sadiquallah's father, Haji Naim, was the first to be shot in his home, testifying how he saw the shooter climb over a wall with a light on his head before firing . The . stories recounted by the villagers during testimony have been harrowing. They described . torched bodies, a son finding his wounded father, and boys cowering . behind a curtain while others screamed 'We are children! We are . children!' One girl, Robina, who was shot in the leg, told how she hid behind her father when the gunman came to her village, and how her father died as shots were fired. Bales sat . quietly throughout, betraying no reaction to what he heard. Robina's . friend, Zardana, now eight, also testified, but only briefly to describe . what the shooter was wearing. Zardana . suffered a gunshot wound to the top of her head, and when she arrived . at a nearby military base, the doctors focused on treating the other . injured victims first. They figured Zardana had no chance of surviving. After two months at a military . hospital in Afghanistan and three more at a Navy hospital in San Diego, . she can walk and talk again. The . Afghan witnesses recounted the villagers who lived in the attacked . compounds and listed the names of those killed, to provide a record of . the lives lost. The bodies were buried quickly under Islamic custom, and no forensic evidence was available to prove the number of victims. The military courtroom on Joint Base Lewis McChord in Washington, U.S., where the preliminary hearing was held . Sadiquallah, . a slight boy of about 13 or 14 whose head rose just above his chair at . the witness table, described being awakened by a neighbor screaming that . an American had 'killed our men'. He said he and another boy, Zardana's . brother, ran to hide in a storage room and ducked behind a curtain. It . provided no protection from the bullet that grazed his head and . fractured his skull. Sadiquallah said the shooter had a gun and a light, . but he could not identify the man. The other child was hit in the thigh . and also survived. That boy, Rafiullah, testified on Saturday that an . American had attacked them and put a gun in his sister's mouth. His . father, Samiullah, was away when the shootings occurred, and testified . that by the time he returned the next morning, his two wounded children . had been driven to a base for treatment. He found his mother among the . four corpses at the compound. 'I just saw her, I cried, and I could not look on her face,' he said. Prosecutors . said that in between his attacks, Bales woke a fellow soldier, reported . what he'd done and said he was headed out to kill more. The soldier . testified that he didn't believe what Bales said, and went back to . sleep. During . cross-examination of several witnesses at the hearing, Bales' attorney, John . Henry Browne, sought to elicit testimony about whether there might have . been more than one shooter. One . Army Criminal Investigations Command special agent testified that . several months after the massacre, she took a statement from one woman . whose husband was killed. The . woman reported that there were two soldiers in her room - one took her . husband out of the room and shot him, and the other held her back when . she tried to follow. But . other eyewitnesses reported that there was just one shooter, and several . soldiers have testified that Bales returned to his base at Camp . Belambay, just before dawn, alone and covered in blood. A video taken from a surveillance blimp also captured a sole figure returning to the base.

Bush and son of former Florida Gov Jeb Bush, has made a campaign filing required of candidates planning to run for state office, an official said Thursday night. The younger Bush, of Fort Worth, Texas, filed a campaign treasurer appointment on Wednesday, a requirement for someone to become a candidate under campaign finance law, Tim Sorrells, general counsel for the Texas Ethics Commission, told The Associated Press. Sorrells said the report does not specify what office Bush might seek, if any, and he had no other details on the filing, which wasn't available online. Political aspirations: George P. Bush, 36, is pictured at a campaign rally in Texas last month . Famous family: George P. Bush is the son of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, who is being talked about as a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2016 . Bush did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment, and no phone listing for him could be found. The 36-year-old said in September his goal was to run for office and acknowledged that he had his eyes on several statewide offices. Raised in Florida, Bush decided to settle in Texas, home to his uncle and his grandfather, former President George H.W. Bush. Playing the part: Bush kisses an infant during a small political rally at the Republican Party Headquarters in Harlingen, Texas . He runs a consulting firm and has been active in Republican Party outreach to college students. He's also the co-founder of Hispanic Republicans of Texas, a group that seeks to elect Hispanic candidates. Ana Navarro, who was the national Hispanic co-chairwoman for John McCain when he ran for president in 2008, tweeted her enthusiasm Thursday. 'Wrote check for my friend, (at)georgepbush newly formed exploratory committee for office in TX. Young, pragmatic, Hispanic, just what GOP needs,' Navarro's tweet read. Bush and his wife, Amanda, met while attending law school at the University of Texas at Austin. After working as a lawyer, Bush became a partner in a real estate investment firm. He has started his second company, St. Augustine Partners, a business consulting firm aimed at small- and medium-market energy industries. Bush also has Navy service on his resume, including a six-month deployment to Afghanistan, where, for security purposes, he was given a different name.

Famously freewheeling San Francisco may no longer be a city where anything goes - and that includes clothing. The city's lawmakers are scheduled to vote on Tuesday on laws that would ban nudity in most public places - and, in a funny twist, it's a man called Wiener who's leading the campaign. Supervisor for the gay Castro District Scott Wiener's proposals to ban anyone over the age of five from exposing 'his or her genitals, perineum or anal region on any public street, sidewalk, street median, parklet or plaza' have caused outrage amongst the city's many nudie devotees. Scroll down for video . Baring it all: a man protesting a city ban on public nudity undresses at Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco . No place to hide: Scott Wiener will face plenty of public opposition . Tuesday when officials vote at City Hall (right) on a ban on public . nudity. Sheriffs plan to escort at the hearing who tries to strip in . protest from the building . Wiener felt compelled to act two years . ago after constituents complained about the naked men who gather in a . small Castro plaza most days and sometimes walk the streets au naturel. He persuaded his colleagues last year . to pass a law requiring a cloth to be placed between public seating and . bare rears, yet the complaints have continued. 'I don't think having some guys taking . their clothes off and hanging out seven days a week at Castro and . Market Street is really what San Francisco is about. I think it's a . caricature of what San Francisco is about,' Wiener said. The proposed ban predictably has produced outrage, as well as a lawsuit. Outrage: many San Francisco residents are angry at Castro District supervisor Scott Wiener for sponsoring the proposed public nudity ban . Last week, about two dozen people disrobed in front of City Hall and marched around the block. McCray Winpsett, 37, said he . understands the disgust of residents who would prefer not to see the . body modifications and sex enhancement devices sported by some of the . Castro nudists. But he thinks Wiener's prohibition goes too far in undermining a tradition 'that keeps San Francisco weird.' 'A few lewd exhibitionists are really ruining it for the rest of us,' he said. 'It's my time to come out now to . present myself in a light and show what true nudity is all about so . people can separate the difference between what a nudist is and an . exhibitionist is.' Because clothes are required to enter . City Hall itself, demonstrators who try to disrobe at the Board of . Supervisors meeting will be escorted out by sheriff's deputies. San Francisco lawyer Christina . DiEdoardo filed a federal lawsuit last week on behalf three men that . seeks to block Wiener's ordinance, if it passes and is signed by Mayor . Edwin Lee. Outspoken believer: McCray Winpsett, 37, is an avid nudist supporter in San Francisco . The complaint alleges that the ban . infringes on the free speech rights of nudists and discriminates against . those who cannot afford to obtain a city permit. While it may seem strange that going . out in the buff is not already illegal in San Francisco, most California . cities do not have local nudity laws, Wiener said. 'I suspect there are a lot of places . that maybe don't currently have a local law (and) that if people started . getting naked every day would quickly see a local law,' Wiener said. If Wiener's ban is passed, the violators will face a maximum penalty of a $100 fine for a first offense. But prosecutors would have authority . to charge a third violation as a misdemeanor punishable by up to a $500 . fine and a year in jail. Exemptions would be made for . participants at permitted street fairs and parades, such as the city's . annual gay pride event and the Folsom Street Fair, which celebrates . sadomasochism and other sexual subcultures.","Campaign led by Castro District supervisor Scott Wiener to ban public nudity goes to a City Hall vote on Tuesday .

A school tutor who is tasked with improving the behaviour of pupils has been caught on camera feeding a wild rat by the school kitchens. Paul Ashworth is now being investigated by the school for his own behaviour after parents complained after a video of the incident was posted on Facebook. The 33-year-old is a student support co-ordinator at Springwell Community College and runs the behaviour improvement programme. He was filmed laughing as the foot long rodent scurried from bushes to nibble bread that was left out. Food for thought: Tutor Paul Ashworth was caught on film feeding a wild rat near the school's kitchen (file picture) Pest control experts were called in to the 900 pupil school near Chesterfield after fears that the pregnant rat could start an infestation. A furious parent reported the incident to the school after seeing the video on the social networking site and an investigation has been launched. Mandy Sludds, told The Sun: ‘For staff to encourage wild rats not far from where children are eating and playing is just diabolical. 'This was stupid, mindless behaviour from an adult in charge of sorting out children behaving badly. 'The bread had been put out for the rat not far from the kitchen block. It was a big, pregnant thing with a nest under a bush.' Rat problem: Springwell Community College launched an investigation after a school tutor was filmed feeding a wild rat . The footage was filmed by a female student on her mobile phone and shows the rat as it ran in and out of its nest to grab the food, the girl was then allegedly warned by Ashworth and his two colleagues not to show the video to anyone. Ms Sludds, from Staveley in Derbyshire, added: 'It was particularly bad because the school has only been up a couple of years, but the old building on the site had a real rat problem.' Ms Sludds’ children, Shannon, 15, and Reece, 12, plus a friend stayed off school for a day in protest of the incident. In the film, one of the men calls out: 'Come on you little sod. It's obviously a clever rat.' Ashworth is then heard saying: ‘Fresh meat.’ He refused to comment, saying: ‘It's being dealt with by my line manager.' Acting head Tracey Burnside confirmed pest controllers were called to put down rat traps. She said in The Sun: 'Clearly staff should not put out food for any animals on school grounds.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 08:51 EST, 15 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:51 EST, 15 November 2012 . A judge has decided against forcing a mentally impaired Nevada woman to have an abortion after the court and her family reached a tentative agreement to help her through her high-risk pregnancy. The 32-year-old woman's legal guardian told local station KRNV-TV on Wednesday that district court Judge Egan Walker had agreed that the woman wants to carry the pregnancy to term and that the evidence doesn't show it's medically necessary to abort the baby. The woman, who has the mental capacity of a 6-year-old, had wandered from a Reno group home that she was living in and became pregnant 13 weeks ago. Big issue: The parents of a pregnant woman with a mental age of six and the Nevada court have agreed to help the woman carry her child to term even though it may put her health at risk . The child's father has not been . identified, and it's unknown whether the pregnancy resulted from rape or . consensual sex, according to court documents. The Associated Press is not naming the woman or her parental guardians because the circumstances of conception remain unclear. The woman’s parents, who hail from . Fernley, Nevada, adopted the woman and several siblings from Costa Rica . in 1992, and they were appointed as her legal guardians when she turned . 18. She suffers from fetal alcohol syndrome and epilepsy. After taking the abortion option off . the table, Walker said he plans to hold additional medical evidentiary . hearings in the weeks ahead to determine the safest way to proceed. Ruling: Judge Egan Walker (left) ruled that an abortion wasn't legally necessary, much to the delight of pro-life advocates like Melissa Clement (right) who got involved in the case . The court became involved in late . September, when officials with Social Services voiced concerns about the . effects that her medication could have on the fetus. The case quickly . drew attention from anti-abortion advocates nationally. The woman's parents said that while . the pregnancy poses health risks to their daughter and the baby, medical . experts back their decision to continue the pregnancy. Melissa Clement, president of Nevada Right to Life, praised the judge's announcement that abortion no longer was an alternative. 'We are pleased (the pregnant woman) will be able to carry her baby to term and that the court recognized . that childbirth is a natural process and is the generally accepted . course of treatment for pregnancy,' she said in a statement. Deadline set: Legal hurdles in the case meant that it was brought to the state's supreme court but eventually the verdict was handed down a district court judge . Last week, the Nevada Supreme Court . denied a request to block Walker's hearings into the health risks of the . woman's pregnancy. The woman's parents argued that the judge lacked the . authority to terminate the pregnancy of their daughter. They claimed they have exclusive . authority over her health care decisions, and they want their daughter . to carry the baby to term in line with their Catholic religious beliefs. The state Supreme Court disagreed, but the tentative agreement apparently makes the point moot.","Nevada couple are legal guardians of their daughter, 32 .

Robert Bales, seen in 2011, is on trial for the murder of 16 Afghans slain in the early hours of March 11 . Little Robina took her seat wearing a deep-red head covering and a nervous smile, ready to tell her story. When the questions began, what she recalled seemed impossibly dark: how she hid behind her father when the gunman came to their village that night, how the stranger fired and how her father died, cursing in pain and anger. 'I was standing behind my father,' she testified by video feed from Afghanistan on Saturday night during a hearing for the soldier accused of killing 16 civilians, including nine children, in Kandahar Province. She added: 'He shot my father.' One of the bullets struck her in the leg, but she didn't realize it right away, she said. Her testimony came on the second overnight session of the preliminary hearing for Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, who prosecutors say slipped away from his base to attack two villages. The slayings drew such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations in Afghanistan, and it was three weeks before American investigators could reach the crime scenes. The stories recounted by the villagers have been harrowing. They described torched bodies, a son finding his wounded father, and boys cowering behind a curtain while others screamed ""We are children! We are children!"" Bales sat quietly throughout, betraying no reaction to what he heard. Robina's friend, Zardana, now eight, also testified, but only briefly to describe what the shooter was wearing.

Before she testified, Zardana sat at the witness table sipping from a pink juice box. A loose head covering and a barrette held her dark brown hair out of her face. The hearing at Joint Base Lewis-McChord is meant to help determine whether Bales, 39, will face a court-martial in the deaths. He could face the death penalty if he is convicted. The Ohio native and father-of-two from Lake Tapps, Washington, has not entered a plea and was not expected to testify. His attorneys have not discussed the evidence, but say he has post-traumatic stress disorder and suffered a concussive head injury while serving in Iraq. The Afghan witnesses recounted the villagers who lived in the attacked compounds and listed the names of those killed, to provide a record of the lives lost. The bodies were buried quickly under Islamic custom, and no forensic evidence was available to prove the number of victims. Sadiquallah, a slight boy of about 13 or 14 whose head rose just above his chair at the witness table, described being awakened by a neighbor screaming that an American had 'killed our men'. Witness: Tosh Ali, a guard with the Afghan National Army, is shown on the right-hand side of a video monitor during testimony that recounted the chilling slaughter of alleged innocent men, women and children . He said he and another boy, Zardana's brother, ran to hide in a storage room and ducked behind a curtain. It provided no protection from the bullet that grazed his head and fractured his skull. Sadiquallah said the shooter had a gun and a light, but he could not identify the man. The other child was hit in the thigh and also survived. That boy, Rafiullah, testified on Saturday that an American had attacked them and put a gun in his sister's mouth. His father, Samiullah, was away when the shootings occurred, and testified that by the time he returned the next morning, his two wounded children had been driven to a base for treatment. He found his mother among the four corpses at the compound. 'I just saw her, I cried, and I could not look on her face,' he said. Prosecutors said that in between his attacks, Bales woke a fellow soldier, reported what he'd done and said he was headed out to kill more. The soldier testified that he didn't believe what Bales said, and went back to sleep. During cross-examination of several witnesses Saturday, Bales' attorney, John Henry Browne, sought to elicit testimony about whether there might have been more than one shooter. One Army Criminal Investigations Command special agent testified that several months after the massacre, she took a statement from one woman whose husband was killed. The woman reported that there were two soldiers in her room - one took her husband out of the room and shot him, and the other held her back when she tried to follow. But other eyewitnesses reported that there was just one shooter, and several soldiers have testified that Bales returned to his base at Camp Belambay, just before dawn, alone and covered in blood. A video taken from a surveillance blimp also captured a sole figure returning to the base. Survivor: Sadiquallah, a young boy of about 13 or 14, is sketched left during his testimony against Bales, right, after surviving the attack despite a bullet grazing his skull .

Illegal immigrants and terrorist suspects with no right to remain in Britain will be forced out of the country quicker after David Cameron said he would cut short their appeals yesterday. The Prime Minister announced plans to speed up government, including overhauling the system of judicial reviews which lawyers can use to protest against the government. The plans were billed as a way of curtailing opposition to new infrastructure projects but the vast majority of judicial reviews concern immigration cases. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last night confirmed that the plans will prevent those with no right to be in Britain delaying their deportation for as long in future. David Cameron has revealed plans to cut short appeals by illegal immigrants and terror suspects in the wake of the Abu Hamza fiasco. Hamza used judicial reviews of extradition arrangements to hold up his removal . Hook handed hate preacher Abu Hamza is one of dozens of terrorist suspects who have sought judicial review of their extradition arrangements to hold up their removal. But tens of thousands of ordinary immigration cases also get mired in time consuming judicial review cases. In future the government plans to increase the cost of judicial reviews, reduce the time period in which people can bring a case and reduce the number of appeals from four to two. Speaking at the CBI conference in London, Mr Cameron said judicial review had become a 'massive growth industry' which was delaying action and costing taxpayers too much money. ‘We urgently needed to get a grip on this.’ Mr Grayling told the Mail: ‘People who do not have the right to remain in this country should not be in the position of being able to lodge trivial challenges to delay their removal, even when they know they have no chance of success. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last night confirmed that the plans will prevent those with no right to be in Britain delaying their deportation for as long in future . ‘This is why I am looking to change the system so public time and money are not wasted on spurious claims that clog up our courts.’ The number of judicial review applications has rocketed in the past three decades, from 160 in 1974 to 11,200 last year - an increase of almost 7,000 per cent. At the same time, the proportion of successful applications is very low and amount to little more than time wasting.In 2011 only one in six applications determined were granted permission to be heard and even fewer were successful when they went ahead. Mr Cameron used his speech to the CBI to demand an end to further regulations, axing politically correct equalities red tape in Whitehall departments to speed up new policies to boost growth. And he said the government has already scrapped guidelines which forced ministers to hold a three month consultation on major policies when they could just as soon consult the relevant parties in a couple of weeks. The PM said he was 'calling time' on Government departments having to make Equality Impact Assessments, which assess how policies affect ethnic minorities and the disabled. He said: 'We have smart people in Whitehall who consider equalities issues while they’re making the policy. We don’t need all this extra tick-box stuff. 'Mr Cameron said: ‘In government we have taken the letter of this law and gone way beyond it, with Equality Impact Assessments for every decision we make. 'Let me be very clear. I care about making sure we treat people equally. But let’s have the courage to say it - caring about these things does not have to mean churning out reams of bureaucratic nonsense. 'We have smart people in Whitehall who consider equalities issues while they’re making the policy. 'We don’t need all this extra tick-box stuff.’ Mr Cameron said that too often ministers announced policies which then got bogged down in Whitehall red tape. 'When we came to power there had to be a three-month consultation on everything - and I mean everything, no matter how big or small,” he said. 'So we are saying to ministers: here’s a revolutionary idea - you decide how long a consultation period this actually needs. 'If you can get it done properly in a fortnight - great. Indeed, the Department for Education has already had a consultation done and dusted in two weeks. If there is no need for a consultation, then don’t have one.'","PM wants powers to get rid of terror suspects .

David Cameron’s former spin doctor was charged yesterday with illegally purchasing sensitive information about the Royal Family. Andy Coulson is accused of conspiring to obtain an internal telephone directory for the Royal Household. The directory, known as the Green Book, includes landlines and mobile numbers for royal aides. The offence is alleged to have taken place while he oversaw the work of News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman. The claims were revealed as Coulson, Goodman, two other News International employees and a Ministry of Defence official were accused of a ‘cash for stories’ conspiracy. Rebekah Brooks, former chief executive of News International, has been charged with paying a defence strategist £100,000 for information over a seven-year period. The announcement was the most significant yet in the Scotland Yard investigation into corrupt payments to public officials. It threw News International into a fresh crisis as claims against the company continued to mount and the first formal allegations were made relating to The Sun newspaper.

For several generations board game fans have searched for clues to crack the classic whodunnit. Was it Reverend Green in the library with the revolver or Miss Scarlet in the billiard room with the candlestick? But makers of the much-loved board game Cluedo are to give the format a new lease of life with a modern twist - just in time for Christmas. Modern: The classic board game Cluedo has been given a makeover with new characters and a London edition to be launched today . New: Instead of the traditional characters, including the likes of Mrs White and Miss Scarlet, the new version will feature a socialite, the mayor and a footballer . The game has been given a 21st century makeover with a whole new cast of characters replacing the classic figures players have come to know and love, with a footballer, journalist and socialite stepping in for the likes of Mrs White and Professor Plum. And London will become the setting for the first ever regionalised version of the parlour game with versions set in Birmingham, Cardiff and Edingburgh and elsewhere also set to hit the market next year. Inventor: Anthony E Pratt, a solicitors clerk from Birmingham, patented the originally Cluedo concept in 1944 . It will feature Malcolm Mustard the Mayor, Gus green the footballer, Paul Plum the journalist, Penelope Peacock the socialite and Winnie White the therapist. Instead of the murder taking place in the study, kitchen, dining room, bathroom, garage, living room or games room, the scene of the crime will now either be St Paul's Cathedral, Tower Bridge, Covent Garden, Heathrow, Wembley, the Houses of Parliament, Knightsbridge, Canary Wharf and Soho. One thing that will not change in the new version however, is the customary list of possible murder weapons - the candlestick, dagger, lead piping, revolver, rope and wrench. There are 324 potential murder combinations in the new game, with the victim - a high profile Media Mogul - always staying the same. And it includes portraits of each . character, with the Mayor, who lives in Westminster, described as 'loved . by the people' with 'an abundance of charisma'. But . in London Cluedo, suspicion is rife as rumours spread about the board’s . Media Mogul turning on the Mayor and exposing him so he will ditch his . ambitious plans to climb politics ‘greasy pole’. And . all the other shady characters are under suspicion too, with the . Camden-based Therapist’s motive for murder stemming from a move she made . on the Media Mogul, who has been using her couch in an unorthodox way. London-based . games maker Winning Moves UK is launching the game today at College . Green, Westminster, with the help of a Boris Johnson look-alike on a . Boris Bike armed with a giant candlestick. Suspect: The new version features the likes of footballer Gus Green who is described as 'consumed by greed' Familiar: The blond mayor is described as having 'an abundance of charisma' The new game features new suspects . New landmark murder scenes replace the old rooms . The game still features the same selection of weapons . Camden therapist Winnie White is one of the new characters . Journalist Paul Plum is 'always looking for the next scoop' Sally Scarlett is a talent show winner 'clinging to stardom' Traditional: The original Cluedo game as released by Waddingtons . An oversized 5ft by 5ft replica of the game will also be on show, and people around the capital will be treated to Cluedo street art complete with a silhouette game and the words ‘Was it the Mayor’ outside tube stations and popular tourist destinations. ‘Detectives’ have been handing out Top Secret tips as to ‘Whodunnit’ across London this morning, telling the public to meet at Westminster at 1pm to solve the case. Winning Moves UK Chairman Tom Liddell said: 'The public has been asking us for some time to do regionalised CLUEDO. And with the 2012 buzz around London, we are now delighted to oblige. 'We have very exciting plans to roll out other regional CLUEDO’s across the UK and Ireland too.' The board game Cluedo was first patented by Birmingham solicitor's clerk Anthony E Pratt back in 1944 and was originally called 'Murder!' and designed to provide entertainment in shelters during lengthy air raids. But the game wasn't released until 1949 after it was picked up by Waddingtons who renamed it Cluedo - a play on the word 'clue' and 'ludo' which is Latin for 'I play'. It was released at around the same time in the US and renamed Clue. Unlike the version that board game fans came to know and love, Pratt's original concept featured 10 characters, including names such as Mr Gold and Mr Brown, one of whom would be designated as the murder victim by random drawing at the beginning of each game. It also featured a range of nine weapons, with murders committed using an axe, bomb, poison or even a fireplace poker. There has been three editions released in the UK over the years, with the longest lasting 47 years following the game's release. The latest edition was released back in 2002/2003. As well as providing hours of fun as a board game, Cluedo has also been the inspiration for a number of spin off products, the 1985 cult classic film Clue starring Tim Curry and Christopher Lloyd, a Broadway musical, a play and various game shows.","Traditional Cluedo characters killed off as the popular board game gets a 21st century makeover .

When a beautiful protected pine tree was chopped down in the dead of night, investigators were baffled. Until a council officer followed a trail of clues...that led straight to a neighbour’s hot tub. Andrew Dearing, who was called in to investigate the destruction of the 40ft maritime pine, started his inquiry standing at the stump of the tree. Accused: Neil Davey, left, allegedly 'paid or otherwise instructed' his friend and tree surgeon Thomas McGuire, right, to cut down his neighbour's tree. Council investigators say it blocked Davey's sea views from his hot tub . Felled: Neighbour Steve Bransgrove told the court he was woken by the revving of a chainsaw during the night. When he looked out his window the huge tree was on top of a wall. Following a trail of flattened grass, he . came to the home of neighbour Neil Davey where an outdoor hot tub and . sun terrace now, in the absence of the tree, had a gloriously . uninterrupted view of Poole Harbour. ‘I saw the sun lounger and hot tub and saw where the tree had stood,’ Mr Dearing told Bournemouth Crown Court. 'I realised the owners had perfect views which were obstructed by the tree in question' Poole Council officer Andrew Dearing . ‘I thought, “Here’s a family who clearly enjoys sitting on their patio looking at the extensive views”. ‘I realised the owners had perfect views which were obstructed by the tree in question.’ Businessman and hot tub owner Neil Davey, 51, is accused of arranging . for the pine, which had stood in the garden on the Dorset coast for 55 . years and was protected by a preservation order, to be chopped down to . improve his sea view. Tree surgeon Thomas McGuire, 34, is charged with carrying out the deed. Investigation: Poole council launched a probe after the 55-year-old tree was cut down during the night . Mapped: A council investigator said Neil Davey's sea views from his new hot tub and sun terrace were being blocked by the tree . Neighbour Stephen Bransgrove, 53, told the court how he was woken by the . sound of a chainsaw the night his tree came crashing down in June 2010. ‘It sounded like a two-stroke engine, it was a loud revving noise,’ he . said. ‘It wasn’t there for very long before all of a sudden a bang came . and that was it. ‘It was the sort of noise as if something had hit the house, it was a loud bang.’ He told the jury that he went to a window overlooking the garden and saw . his tree on top of a wall. He rang the police and Poole council were . called in to investigate. Mr Dearing, a planning enforcement officer at the council, told the . court that once the tree on Mr Bransgrove’s property was out of the . way,  his neighbour Davey had perfectly uninterrupted views of Poole . Harbour, the Isle of Purbeck, and Corfe Castle. He refuted a suggestion he had been presumptious in claiming Mr Davey . had ordered the tree to be chopped, saying: ‘I was thinking “Who would . actually gain?” ‘The beneficiaries of the tree’s destruction would be Mr Davey and Mr Davey’s family.’ Davey, who owns an auctioneers based in Poole, was on honeymoon with . wife Sheena in France on the night the tree was chopped down. But the council claims he arranged for McGuire, who had been working at . his £550,000 home, to remove the pine tree in his absence. Matthew Tomlinson, prosecuting for Poole council, said a tree . preservation order had been in place on the pine since 1990.  ‘Mr Davey . lives in a neighbouring property to where the tree was cut down,’ he . told the court. ‘It is the prosecution’s case that Mr Davey paid Mr McGuire or otherwise instructed Mr McGuire to cut down the tree.’ He said the two men claimed to have known each other for only five months, but had actually been friends for ten years. He said although McGuire claimed to be in a different county on the . night the tree had been destroyed, signals from his mobile phone had . been traced to Poole. Improved: The stunning views of Poole Harbour after the protected tree was cut down . Andy Luddington, arborilogical officer at the council, told the jury the . pine had been a healthy tree that stood 40ft high and had a canopy . spread of 23ft.

Police officer Brendan Buggie, pictured, lost control of his car while drink-driving and killed his former girlfriend's best friend, who he was dating at the time, a court heard . A police officer lost control of his car while drink-driving and killed his new girlfriend, a court heard today. Brendan . Buggie, 39, an officer with Greater Manchester Police, had just started . a relationship with Justyna Stanczak, his former girlfriend's best friend, when the incident occurred, a jury . has been told. The court heard he skidded on an icy road in Ramsbottom, Lancashire, while twice the legal limit in the early hours of December 5 last year. Bradford Crown Court heard that Buggie’s Toyota skidded into a stationary white van, killing 26-year-old Justyna, the best friend of his former girlfriend Lucy Fox. Prosecutors said Miss Fox’s mother, taxi driver Elaine Singleton, had seen Buggie and Justyna holding hands that night and told her daughter. That sparked a furious text exchange between the three, so Buggie had offered to drive his new girlfriend back to her home in Bury. Nicholas Williams, prosecuting, told a jury of eight men and four women that Buggie had drunk six pints of beer at several different pubs in Ramsbottom on December 4, before meeting with Justyna, who worked in a wine bar. He knew the young Polish national 'very well' through his ex-girlfriend who he had recently split with, but was keen to reconcile with, Mr Williams told the court. He said that despite this, he and Justyna had begun a physical relationship, and that night had met for a drink before walking back to Buggie’s house - when they were spotted by Miss Fox’s mother. Mr Williams said the text exchange between Miss Fox and the defendant had upset Justyna, and so Buggie offered to drive her the six miles back to her home in Bury. Mr Williams said: 'He told police he had been hoping to get back together with his ex-girlfriend. She had ended the relationship and he was feeling really down at the time. 'By the time Justyna and the defendant got to his house it was after midnight and his dark blue Toyota was on the drive. 'He told police he had to de-ice the car as hail had frozen on the windscreen. 'The weather was ""treacherous"" as he called it. 'He said he had been slipping on ice on his walk back from the pub. He knew the road would be icy and was familiar with the road.' Scene: Manchester Road in Ramsbottom where the accident happened in 'treacherous' conditions . Mr Williams told the court there was a 'thick sheet of ice' near the scene of the accident on the single-carriageway Manchester Road. Another witness had been driving from Bury to Ramsbottom, and Mr Williams told the court he had described ice or frost 'glistening' on the surface of the road. He had been driving at around 20-30mph. Buggie told cops that at around 12.30am, he had been driving from Ramsbottom to Bury at the speed limit - 40mph, when he approached a left-hand bend in the road, and the back end of his car had skidded out. He collided with a white van on the other side of the road, parked adjacent to a row of terraced houses. The court heard Buggie called an ambulance straight away, and neighbours came out of their houses to see what had happened - with one telling cops how she could smell alcohol 'immediately'. When the police arrived, and asked him how much he had had to drink, Buggie told them: 'enough'. Justyna was unconscious straight away and despite regaining consciousness briefly, she died at around 4.30am at Fairfield General Hospital. Mr Williams told the jury: 'In police interviews, the defendant said that despite having drunk six pints, he considered himself fine to drive. 'He said he knew the roads were slippery. In fact, he said he crawled along the minor road to the main road, but believed the main road would have been gritted. 'When asked what caused the accident, he said: ""The vehicle slipping, I think it was the road conditions"". 'But the prosecution say if he had been driving in such a way to take account of these conditions the accident would never have happened. 'The reality is if he had never been drinking he would never had lost control of the vehicle and Justyna would never have lost her life. 'His driving fell below the standard of a careful driver.' Buggie denies the charge of causing death by careless driving while over the prescribed limit. The trial continues.

A man with a suspended driving license has been accused of killing his wife and critically injuring their special needs son after losing control of their car and ploughing them down outside their home. Michael Rivard, 48, told police that he was inside the vehicle in Quincy, Massachusetts when it started moving forward and when he tried to stop it, he hit the gas instead of the brake. The car lurched forward and knocked down his wife, Beatrice, and their adult son, Michael Jr., on the sidewalk outside their home. She was pinned under the Lincoln Continental and died at the scene. Michael Jr. remains in critical condition with internal injuries in hospital but is expected to survive. Scroll down for video . Pained: Michael Rivard allegedly ran over his wife and critical injured his son outside their home . It was not Rivard's first crash; just three months ago, his wife needed to be cut from their vehicle after he crashed it into a telephone pole while he was allegedly under the influence of drugs. Rivard tried to hide his face in his sweater as he appeared at Quincy District Court on Monday. He was unsteady on his feet and leaned on guards as they took him into the court. He pleaded not guilty to charges including motor vehicle homicide, negligent operation of a motor vehicle, operating a motor vehicle after revocation, and impeded operation of a motor vehicle. The judge ordered Rivard to be on a $10,000 cash bail, and his attorney, Raffi Yessayan, said his client was 'devastated' by the accident. Scene: He told police he pressed the gas instead of the brake and darted onto the sidewalk, hitting his family . Tragic: The accident took place outside the family's home, pictured. Beatrice Rivard died at the scene . The death came after Rivard, whose license was revoked in 2011, climbed into his wife's car at 7.50am on Monday, police said. Prosecutor Debi Curley said Beatrice, 67, and her son were walking around the corner when the car darted onto the sidewalk, hit them, snapped a utility . pole and knocked over a fence. One neighbour, Eliza Bergstrom, told the Boston Herald she heard screams and saw Rivard's son under the car. 'He was screaming, ""My stomach, my stomach"",' she said. 'I saw what I thought was a sweatshirt on the ground, then I realised it was his wife. I grabbed her hand, and it was limp.' Neighbours ran to the family and desperately tried to rescue Beatrice from under the car, using brooms, jacks and shovels, but she died at the scene. Struggle: Rivard was unsteady on his feet as he was led into Quincy District Court to face his charges . History: Rivard has been in four car crashes since 2011 and has had his license permanently suspended . Curley said Rivard told an officer at the scene: 'I can’t believe I just ran them over.' Police took Rivard into custody and said he often drove without a valid license. Records show traffic violations, crashes and license suspensions dating back to 1987, according to the Patriot Ledger. He has had four car crashes since June 2011 and his license has been indefinitely suspended . on several occasions - most recently in June. In August, he hit a telephone pole and rescue crews needed a machine to remove Beatrice from the passenger seat, prosecutor Debi Curley said. 'Police found him in the middle of the street, foaming at the mouth, with white powder around his lips,' she said. Home: The couple, who lived in Quincy, MA, had been married for 31 years and had two adult sons . Rivard was charged with operating a motor vehicle under the influence of drugs, but was later released. On Monday, the judge revoked his bail in the case. According to their marriage certificate, Michael and Beatrice Rivard married in 1982 when Beatrice was 37 and Michael was 18. Yessayan asked the judge to release his client on his promise to return to court so that he could plan his wife's funeral - but Rivard has been kept behind bars. 'As a result of this accident, he lost his wife of 31 years, his special-needs son is in the hospital in critical condition,' Yessayan said. 'He wants to be able to bury his wife.' Rivard will return to court on December 14. See below for video .","Tragedy comes just three months after Beatrice Rivard, 67, escaped another crash with her husband, Michael Rivard, at the wheel .

Jane Austen originally left the first prints of Emma to her family and the Royal household . An incredibly rare first edition of Jane Austen's novel Emma is tipped to sell for 200,000 pounds after being discovered. The three volume presentation copy is the only one from the original print run of 12 known to exist today. The literary legend requested that 11 of the books went to members of the Royal family, including the Prince Regent, and her own family. The one that has now emerged for sale was gifted to Anne Sharp, a close friend of the novelist. A clerk at the publishers was specifically instructed by Austen to pen the words 'from the author' on the title page of the book, which is still present today. Emma was the last of Austen's work to be published while she was alive and followed her other classics Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice and Mansfield Park. It tells the tale of the misadventures of matchmaker Emma Woodhouse. Dr Philip Errington, a specialist in English literature at auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'Jane Austen contacted her publishers and asked for 12 copies of her new novel to go to various people. 'These people were either royalty, members of her family and friends. 'But just one copy went to a friend and that was Anne Sharp, who was the governess at the school of Austen's niece Fanny Knight. The first editions will go up for auction at Sotheby's next month . 'It is not known what happened to the 11 other books and this is the only one of the 12 to come on the market before. 'Jane Austen wasn't a celebrity or personality so there was little need for her to sign copies of her work. 'Its rarity and the fact there is a direct link between the owner and the author gives it its value.' The novel has been in the hands of a private collector for many years. It will be sold at Sotheby's in London on December 12.","The only one from the original print run of 12 known to exist .

An heir who sued his father four times in eight years for selling the family’s £2million estate has been awarded just  £5.60 a year by the High Court. Philip Howard, 51, is involved in a bitter 20-year dispute with his father, Sir John Howard-Lawson, over the sale of 13th-century Corby Castle. The business consultant launched a fourth legal case against his father earlier this year, claiming he had been swindled out of his rightful inheritance. But today a judge dismissed 21 of the 22 allegations against Sir John and his former legal advisers, including claims of coercion, fraud, theft and deception. Family feud: Phillip Howard (left) who sued his father Sir John Lawson-Howard (right) over the sale of the family property Corby Castle in Cumbria, at the High Court today . The Cumbrian castle was bought in 1611 by William Howard, the third son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, who was beheaded for treason under Elizabeth I in 1572. It passed through ten generations of Howards until Sir John sold it to Northern Irish businessman Edward Haughey for £1.85million in 1994. Following yesterday’s judgment, Mr Howard was ordered to pay over £100,000 in costs, but in a strange twist was told he had the right to claim £5.60 a year in ground rent from households on the estate. Mr Howard, who represented himself, glared at his father across the courtroom as he said: ‘You stole the money. You  used it to defend yourself. That’s marvellous.’ He claimed his father’s strategy during the hearing had been to ‘diss [disrepect] me personally in every single way he possibly can’. But Sir John’s barrister Stephen Boyd said Mr Howard had made the latest accusations knowing they would fail, just to put his father ‘through an emotional wringer’. Widower Sir John, 78, said he was ‘greatly saddened’ that the eldest of his three children had once again brought him before the court. He told the Mail: ‘I’m relieved by the outcome. It was what I had expected.’ Sir John inherited the Grade I-listed mansion, set in park and farmland on the bank of the River Eden near Carlisle, in 1961. He said: ‘I often wonder what my ancestors would have made of all this. Our family went through some bad times in the 1800s, but I can’t really tell what they would have made of this. 'I wait with interest until I meet them again.’ Sold for £1.8million: Corby Castle lies on the bank of the River Eden . The sixth baron claims that he was forced to sell the estate after his son used part of it to secure an overdraft on his property business. But when the enterprise failed and Mr Howard was declared bankrupt, with debts of £1million, Sir John says the rest of the estate became ‘unviable’, adding: . ‘The day we sold it was the most appalling day of my life. My family had been there since 1611 – that’s 375 years. It was dreadful.’ Mr Howard began to pursue his father over the sale of the estate just months after the death of Sir John’s wife, Lady (Jean) Howard-Lawson, in 2001. In 2004 he issued the first legal proceedings, claiming Sir John sold the property in breach of a family trust agreement after mismanaging the estate and accumulating debt. Mr Howard has now vowed to go to The Court of Appeal, saying: ‘I am obviously extremely unhappy.’ Mr Justice Norris said Mr Howard, who is married with a 15-year-old daughter, was ‘now deeply hostile’ towards his father. Asked if he would ever make peace with his son, Sir John said: ‘It is long beyond that now I think.’","Philip Howard launched a legal battle with father Sir John Howard-Lawson .

Alonna Norberg said she wasn't practicing medicine at the time and only found out later that propofol and Diprivan are the same product. She told the court in Fargo, North Dakota, that her husband . gave her the drug three times via an intravenous chest tube in 2010 because she was in chronic pain. Last week, she told the court that it was 'true horror' when she awoke in June last year to find she was unable to breathe because her husband was engaged in oral sex with her, according to the Grandforksherald.com.

A boy survived a deadly shooting by playing dead under his murdered brother's body, and his sister was spared because she was down the street sledding on a snowy hill, the family's pastor said. The Rev Grant Patterson said that he spoke to Christian Schuster, 12, about an hour after his grandmother and three of his siblings were shot dead on Sunday in their home in New Town, North Dakota, on the Fort Berthold Indian reservation. Martha Johnson, 64, and three of her grandchildren - Benjamin Schuster, 13, Julia Schuster, 10, and Luke Schuster, 6 - were killed, Mountrail County Sheriff Ken Halvorson said. Murder in a small town: Martha Johnson, pictured with her husband Harley, was shot to death along with three of her grandchildren on Sunday . Crime scene: A stuffed bear is placed on a white picket fence where Martha Johson and three of her grandchildren were murdered on Sunday . He described a man who committed suicide hours later as a 'person of interest' in the slayings. Christian Schuster saw the man who entered his home but didn't recognize him, said Patterson, pastor of the Bethel Lutheran Church in New Town. When the shots rang out, one of his brothers fell on him. 'He laid there and played dead until the . shooter left the house,' Patterson said. Sister Ava Schuster, 8, also . may have been killed had she been home, the pastor said. Tragedy: Mountrail County Sheriff Ken Halvorson described Kalcie Eagle as a 'person of interest' in the killings . 'She was sledding on a hill a block from her house with a bunch of her pals,' Patterson said. 'If not for sledding hills, she may also have been murdered.' The slayings have attracted widespread interest in North Dakota, where homicides are rare. Only 24 murders and non-negligent manslaughters occurred in 2011. Halvorson on Tuesday identified Kalcie Eagle, 21, of New Town, as the man who'd committed suicide in nearby Parshall hours after the slayings. Eagle, who lived a block from the Johnson family and was the son of a former tribal council leader, stabbed himself Sunday night at a friend's home about 20 miles away. The FBI is leading the investigation into the deaths because the federal government has jurisdiction over crimes on reservations. FBI spokesman Kyle Loven would not confirm that investigators were looking at Eagle. He . said it was unlikely the FBI would release any information on the . shootings or the suicide in Parshall 'until all aspects have been nailed . down.' The pastor and the . sheriff said Christian Schuster notified authorities of the shooting, . saying an unknown man had killed his family. 'His brother was on top of him and as . soon as he saw the guy leave, he called 911,' Halvorson said. 'He hung . up on the deputy and said he was going in to the other room to hide.' Patterson said the children had been living with their grandparents, Martha and Harley Johnson, for about two months. New Town: Police are investigating whether an apparent suicide is connected to the murder of a woman and three of her grandchildren on this North Dakota reservation . Their mother had been suffering from some 'emotional issues' and moved across the state to the Grand Forks area, he said. Harley Johnson was out hunting at the time of the killings, Patterson said. 'It's . a time of great confusion for Harley, with the storm of events,' said . Patterson, who believed the surviving children were being cared for by . state Social Services. Senseless: Jessica Bratvold, with her son, Brady, who live nearby, talk about the killing of Martha Johnson and three of her grandchildren . 'He's doing the best that anybody could.' Eagle killed himself Sunday night in Parshall in front of a deputy and a highway patrolman. Halvorson said Eagle walked out of his friend's house and stabbed himself. The sheriff would not say why the officers were at the house. New Town and Parshall are on the Fort Berthold reservation, home to the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara, who are known as the Three Affiliated Tribes. Johnson and her grandchildren were not tribal members, but Eagle was. Halvorson said Eagle was familiar to law enforcement officials in the area. He was arrested in March after leading authorities on a 100-mile, high-speed chase in western North Dakota in a stolen pickup truck pulling a trailer, the sheriff said. Eagle pleaded guilty in August to unauthorized use of a vehicle and was sentenced to a year in jail with 10 months suspended and three years of supervised probation, court records show. He was ordered to pay more than $45,000 in fines and restitution. Halvorson described the Johnsons as 'very upstanding citizens' who had both recently retired. Martha Johnson was a private pilot and had helped authorities in the region with search missions, he said, noting she also had a concealed-carry gun permit. 'I gave her the test,' Halvorson said. Patterson said Martha Johnson was a longtime member of the church, and her grandchildren recently helped serve dinner at a church function. 'They acted like little waitresses and waiters,' he said. 'They were all nice little kids.'

Last month, a Minneapolis man was convicted of helping send young men . to Somalia to join the al-Qaida-linked terrorist group al-Shabab. Along with Kabir, Ralph Deleon, . Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales and Arifeen David Gojali are facing . charges of providing material support to terrorists. The charges can carry a maximum 15-year prison sentence upon conviction. Defense attorneys did not immediately return calls for comment. Federal investigators said Kabir met . Deleon and Santana at a hookah bar and introduced them to the radical . Islamist doctrine of the U.S.-born extremist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who . was killed last year in an American airstrike in Yemen. Kabir, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan, served in the Air Force from 2000 to 2001. He spent some time at Davis Monthan . Air Force Base in Tucson, Ariz., pulling aircraft or vehicle parts from a . supply store. He was administratively separated for unknown reasons and . was given an honorable discharge, the military said. 'It was a standard enlistment that ended early but not for reasons of misconduct,' said Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. According to the court documents, . Deleon said meeting Kabir was like encountering someone from the camps . run by al-Awlaki or Osama bin Laden, who was killed in a U.S. raid last . year on his compound in Pakistan. Kabir was 'basically a mujahid . walking the streets of LA,' Deleon said, using the term for holy . warrior, according to court documents. 'He was just waiting to get his . papers. And I met him at the point of his life where he was about to . go.' Authorities wouldn't say how the . investigation began, but they tracked Kabir's travels last year and . flagged violent extremist messages posted online by Santana. Covert FBI . agents had conversations with Santana online where he expressed his . support of jihad and desire to join al-Qaida. 'We were on them for quite a while,' said FBI Special Agent David Bowdich. In video calls from Afghanistan, . Kabir told the trio he would arrange their meetings with terrorists, . investigators said. Kabir added they could sleep in mosques or the homes . of other jihadists once they arrived in Afghanistan. Whispers of terror: The four suspects were reportedly influenced by the writings of U.S.-born radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike last year . Faces of terror: Gojali, left, was reportedly recruited later by DeLeon, right, and Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales . Stateside, Deleon and Santana were . eager about the prospects of being terrorists. When asked by the FBI . informant if both men had thought about how it would feel to kill . someone, Santana responded, 'The more I think about it, the more it . excites me.' The two men also discussed where they . could do the most damage. After considering going to Palestine and the . Philippines, Santana said he preferred Afghanistan because the military . bases there could easily be ambushed. Santana said he was easily influenced . by people growing up and spent time around gangs. He said converting to . Islam was a good move for him because he could fit in and 'actually . fight for something that's right,' according to court documents. Santana, 21, was born in Mexico, while Deleon, 23, was born in the Philippines. Both are lawful, permanent U.S. residents. Jen Collins, who lives two doors down . from Santana's apartment in Upland, east of Los Angeles, said at least a . dozen FBI agents swarmed his unit early Friday. 'It was like something . coming out of the movies or TV,' Collins said. The apartment was shuttered on . Tuesday, but someone inside removed a sign that read 'Don't burn the . Qur'an, READ IT!' from a shuttered upstairs window as reporters gathered . outside. Targets: The men were allegedly plotting to fight alongside the Taliban against U.S. troops in Afghanistan . Deleon studied business . administration at California State University, San Bernardino, but . withdrew in September after first enrolling five years ago, said . university spokesman Joe Gutierrez. Court documents show the men talked about their propensity for violence. Santana, who claimed he went to . Mexico to learn how to shoot different kinds of guns and how to make . explosives, wanted to be a sniper. Deleon said he hoped he could be on . the front lines or use C-4, an explosive, in an attack. Gojali, a U.S. citizen, was recruited in late September and he said he would be willing to kill, court documents state. 'I watch videos on the Internet, and I . see what they are doing to our brothers and sisters. ... It makes me . cry, and it gets like I'm, like, so angered with them,' Gojali said. Gojali's father, Ghazali Musa, said . he hadn't heard from his son for three months when he suddenly showed up . at the family house last week and said he was leaving on a long trip . with a friend. Gojali's younger sister said the family learned of his arrest through news reports that left them stunned. 'He's not even remotely close to . being violent at all,' the 18-year-old sister told the Associated Press . in an interview in front of the family home. 'He's not capable of any of . this.' From left, Mohammad Atia with his father Gamal Atia , and Muhammad Sanusi speak near their home in Pomona 2012, about their neighbor, Sohiel Omar Kabir who was arrested along with three other men . She said Gojali - vulnerable, . unemployed and lacking even a high school diploma - had recently become . fast friends with Deleon, who was a compelling speaker and popular . figure at the mosque the two attended. 'I just think he was lost. I think . peer pressure is one of his biggest problems in life, and that's why . he's in trouble now,' said the sister, who requested anonymity because . she did not want to be associated with the alleged crimes. 'A lot of . people are saying he was brainwashed by this guy, and my brother, not . being employed, he offered him rides to places, and to him that was a . sign of a true friend.' This past summer, plans to travel to Afghanistan became clearer for the group. They talked about how they would . avoid detection. They talked about opening an Afghan orphanage or . possibly posing as cologne salesmen. They finally devised a cover story . that they were going to attend Kabir's fictional wedding. It's unclear whether Kabir actually . made contact with Taliban or al-Qaida fighters, but in an August video . conversation with Deleon, Kabir was with a shiekh or an imam, the . complaint said. Kabir also had intended to go on a . suicide mission earlier this month but got sick, according to the court . documents. He indicated he would wait for the group, which included the . FBI informant, before staging an attack, according to the affidavit. Court documents also show the . confidential informant had been working with the FBI for more than four . years and received more than $250,000 and unspecified immigration . benefits. The informant had been previously convicted of trafficking . pseudoephedrine. Before going, Deleon said he was . going to leave parents a farewell letter. Asked by the informant if . Deleon could lie about his true intentions in the letter, Deleon said, . it's OK to lie in war. 'I believe right now ... we are in a state of . war,' he said. Using the informant's debit card, . Deleon bought four tickets for a flight from Mexico City to Istanbul . scheduled to leave this past Sunday. Had the men made it to Afghanistan, . they would have initially joined the Taliban and then graduate to . al-Qaida, Bowdich said. 'They saw this as jihad. They saw this as their way to push out the aggressors,' Bowdich said. Even if he failed in a terrorist training camp, Santana said, he would continue trying. 'If for some weird reason, if I can't . handle it, I'm not going to give up,' he said, according to court . documents. 'Like, because, this is my strong intention. This is what I . desire of doing in this life.'","Arrested were Sohiel Omar Kabir, 34; Ralph Deleon, 23; Miguel Alejandro Santana Vidriales, 21; and Arifeen David Gojali, 21 .

A police officer whose new girlfriend died when he lost control of his car while driving at around twice the legal limit said he 'felt sober' when he got behind the wheel. Brendan Buggie, 39, who was not on duty at the time, had downed six pints ahead of the crash in Greater Manchester. Justyna Stanczak, 26, who was in the passenger seat, suffered fatal injuries when the Toyota Celica hit a van in Ramsbottom. Greater Manchester Police officer Buggie, who denies causing death by careless driving while over the prescribed limit, has said the car skidded as a result of icy road conditions on the night of the accident last December. The police officer had been driving Miss Stanczak - the best friend of his ex-girlfriend Lucy Fox - back to her home in Bury after the pair met at the end of her shift in a bar on December 4 last year. The couple had been spotted walking to his own house by Miss Fox's mother and, fearing his ex-partner would turn up, Buggie offered to drive his new girlfriend to her home at around midnight. Buggie, who had spent the afternoon in various local pubs, told Bradford Crown Court: 'I'd had a number of drinks at that time, I'm not denying it. 'But I felt sober.' The officer's car hit a stationary white van parked on the A56 in Ramsbottom after it skidded on the road. Buggie said the roads looked damp and although he did not notice ice on the surface, he had to defrost frozen hail from his car windscreen before the journey. 'As far as I could see, at that time it appeared to be damp,' he said. 'Speed-wise, I didn't feel like I was exceeding 40mph. 'Virtually as I'm exiting the corner the back end has come round to my right-hand side. 'It came as such a surprise because I'd nearly got round the bend,' Buggie said. He said the car fishtailed before smashing into a parked van. 'The split second of the impact, I don't know whether I had my eyes closed or not. 'Straightaway I looked to my left and Justyna's eyes were shut. 'When I looked over, I expected screaming or shouting. But to look over and she's unconscious...To see someone not responding is the worst case scenario.' Scene: Miss Stanczak died after the car hit a van on the A56 Manchester Road in Ramsbottom in 'treacherous' conditions . Buggie called an ambulance but Miss Stanczak, a Polish national, died of 'massive internal bleeding' in hospital hours later, the court was told. Expert witnesses have told the jury the road was extremely icy and the conditions treacherous. The prosecution claims that Buggie was not driving with care and his ability to do so was impeded by the amount he had drunk. Nicholas Williams, prosecuting, told jurors: 'The prosecution say he drove carelessly that night - no doubt because he'd been drinking - by failing to adapt his driving.' The court previously heard that when the defendant's ex-girlfriend learned that he had been seen with Miss Stanczak it sparked a furious text exchange between the trio. The exchange of messages had left Miss Stanczak upset and Buggie offered to drive her home. Despite briefly regaining consciousness after the crash, the 26-year-old died at around 4.30am at Fairfield General Hospital in Bury. The trial, scheduled to last five days, continues.

Horrifying news: Mother Lauren Henry was Christmas shopping while Destiny was supervised by friends when the attack happened . Before the attack: Once comfortable around dogs, with one of her own, Destiny is now petrified of them . Mother Lauren Henry, 21, received the horrifying news from friends who were looking after her daughter while she was Christmas shopping in the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham. She said: ‘She was playing on the roundabout and the dog just jumped on her face, ripping it from the mouth to the cheek. ‘There was blood everywhere.

It was terrifying. ‘She cried all the way to hospital until she saw the nurses. Every time she touched it and it hurt and she could see the blood she was in hysterics but she calmed down eventually. She was a very brave girl.’ Ms Henry said she does not blame the dog for attacking her daughter. She said: ‘I don’t blame the dog for what happened. I blame the owner, who wasn’t there. ‘Destiny has been left petrified of dogs, although she’s OK with her own, Dollar.’ A relative called for the dog to be caught quickly. He said: ‘Destiny is a battler, she’ll be fine, but the next child may not be so lucky.’ One of the friends supervising Destiny bravely fought off the animal, kicking it repeatedly.

A gang of muggers robbed wealthy people at knifepoint after following them home from expensive restaurants, a court heard yesterday. The masked men ripped rings, necklaces and watches worth almost £250,000 from their victims as they reached their doorsteps, the jury was told. Among those attacked were Sir Nigel Rudd, chairman of airports operator BAA, and his wife who were targeted outside their £7million mansion. Targeted: Chairman of BAA Sir Nigel Rudd, pictured left, was one of four wealthy home owners to be attacked by the gang. Jewellery store owner Radcliffe Benjemin, pictured right, yesterday denied any involvement with the gang or handling the stolen goods from their robberies . Expensive taste: The gang have been dubbed the 'Rolex Robbers' after targeting wealthy home owners for their jewellery in the West End of London . Other victims were left fearing for their lives as they were singled out by the gang who stalked London’s most exclusive neighbourhoods, Southwark Crown Court was told. The three men cruised the streets in stolen high-end cars with false number plates looking for lone women and elderly people to rob. They netted valuables worth £242,000, including one ring worth £75,000, before selling the loot to a corrupt Hatton Garden jeweller, the jury heard. Kenneth Millett, prosecuting, said the robberies left victims terrified. The court was told Sir Nigel, 64, and his wife Lesley were robbed after walking home from a Chelsea restaurant in May last year. As they walked through their front door a masked man grabbed it and forced it open, making Lady Rudd fall over. Mr Millett said: ‘She looked up and saw what she believed was a masked man standing over her who then put his knees on her chest. He then pulled her fingers on her left hand trying to get her rings off. He pushed her face and she started to scream. ‘He told her to shut up and ‘‘give him the f****** rings’’. He also removed her Cartier watch from her wrist and tried to remove her bracelet. The scene: The couple were followed from a restaurant near their £7 million central London home and confronted on their doorstep in London's Belgravia (stock image) ‘When he had difficulty he forced it, breaking the clasp. He then ripped the necklace she was wearing from her neck.’ Lady Rudd feared her husband would be killed as a second masked man held a large kitchen knife to his chest and demanded he open a safe. The safe was empty but the men still escaped with valuables worth £84,000. The court heard the gang was also responsible for four other robberies between May and October last year. Two women were attacked in Hampstead within days of each other after returning home from dining in Mayfair, and a third was followed home to Knightsbridge from Chelsea. The robberies netted valuables worth a total of £83,000. The final robbery led to the gang’s arrest after they ripped a ring worth £75,000 from the finger of a woman in October. She scratched one of the men and DNA taken from her nail clippings identified one of the suspects,  the jury was told. Gulam Gani, 47, of West London, Nicholas Lewis, 34, of Romford, Essex, and Shaun Wallace, 30, of West London, all deny conspiracy to rob.

An 81-year-old checkout worker is suing DIY giant B&Q for unfair dismissal, claiming she was sacked for being too old. Dedicated Irene Mullenger had worked at B&Q for almost a 25 years and had planned to continue in the role that she loved, saying that she is not ready to sit at home and 'vegetate'. But the widow was left devastated after bosses at the company, which made £161m profit last year, forced her to leave after unfairly changing her shift pattern, she claims. She is now claiming unfair dismissal . and age related discrimination - making her one of the oldest employees . in Britain ever to do so. Mrs Mullenger claims bosses at the store in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, changed her . shift patterns to hours and days she would not be able to work. She was originally contracted to work 12 hours a week and for the past ten years had worked mornings only on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Friday. But she claims she was asked to work every other weekend, perform early and late shifts and be available for work five days out of seven on a four week rota basis. Mrs Mullenger claims this was indirect age discrimination because she is being asked to work hours most people her age would not usually be able to work. She is also exempt from working Sundays . as a 'protected shop worker' but the new shifts put to her stated she . would have to work a minimum of every other weekend. Because she has been employed by the . same employer continuously since before 26 August 1994 she is a . protected shop worker - which means she can opt out of working Sundays. She alleges she was told that if she did not agree to the new terms of her working shifts she would be sacked. Irene Mullenger had worked at B&Q for almost a quarter of a century and had planned to carry on for many more years in the job she loved . After failed negotiations with management, Mrs Mullenger was dismissed in August. She contacted legal firm Regents Solicitors who issued the claim on October 30 giving B&Q 28 days to respond - they are yet to do so. The claim form reads: ‘It was put to her that if she was not prepared to agree to these changes the Respondent would move to terminate her employment’. Mrs Mullenger, of Great Brickhill, Buckinghamshire, said she was devastated at no longer having the job she believes has helped keep her going. She said: 'I loved working there and I miss it badly. I’m worried I’ll vegetate if I sit at home doing nothing. 'It’s strange not working. Bosses at the company, which made £161m profit last year, forced her to leave after unfairly changing her shift pattern, she claims . 'I’ve worked all my life, for 64 years, and spent more than 30 years with the civil service before I joined B&Q. 'I wasn’t ready to be retired. I’m still fit and healthy and I had planned to carry on working for as long as I could. 'I always said I’d stop when I got too tired to carry on. But the fact is that I’m not tired yet.' Lawyer Daniel Valentine, from Manchester, said: 'I think what the company did to Mrs Mullenger  was absolutely awful. 'She gave her all to B&Q for almost 25 years and she did not deserve to be treated in such a way. 'They are asking her to work hours people her age are usually unable to work. 'She feels they have unfairly changed her shift patterns and discriminating against her because of her age. 'The way she has been treated is utterly shocking.' A spokesman for B&Q said: 'B&Q is proud of its track record on employing older people, almost 30 per cent of our 33,000 employees are over 50 years old and our oldest employee is 89 years old. 'We would never comment on an individual case and as this is an ongoing legal process it is not appropriate to comment further.'","Irene Mullenger had worked for B&Q for nearly 25 years when they allegedly demanded she work shifts she could not do .

Councils who are refusing to reinstate weekly bin collections are today warned they face a cut in Government funding. Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles says a voluntary scheme has ‘stopped the rot’ and prevented more councils switching to hugely unpopular fortnightly schemes. But, in an article on this page, he threatens to go further - suggesting central Government grants to local authorities will be slashed in the long-term for those that refuse to bring back the weekly bin round. Scroll down to read Eric Pickles write: 'It's a human right to have your rubbish taken away' Bin collections: Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles says a voluntary scheme has 'stopped the rot' and prevented more councils switching to hugely unpopular fortnightly schemes . Mr Pickles is also changing the law to prevent councils sending ‘bin spies’ to rifle through people’s bins and issuing penalties for those deemed to have broken recycling rules. At least half the homes in Britain - 10million households covered by 180 local authorities - have lost their weekly collections and now have general rubbish taken away only once every two weeks. Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875 to stamp out cholera and other plagues which claimed huge numbers of lives. They were maintained until after Labour’s 1997 election victory, when local authorities were encouraged to collect household waste and recyclable rubbish on alternate weeks. The Audit Commission downgraded councils in their inspections if they kept weekly collections and told them to adopt ‘progressive’ solutions of ‘only emptying the refuse bin on a fortnightly basis or issuing smaller bins’. But homeowners quickly began to complain about rises in rat and pest populations, smells from food waste left uncollected for a fortnight, and a plethora of bin fines and taxes imposed on those who broke the rules. Falling numbers: At least half the homes in Britain - 10million households covered by 180 local authorities - have lost their weekly collections and now have general rubbish taken away only once every two weeks . Those who overfill bins or accidentally leave rubbish out on the wrong day have risked penalties of up to £1,000. The Daily Mail mounted a long-running campaign to have weekly collections restored. The Coalition announced a £250million scheme to prevent more local authorities moving to fortnightly collections and persuade others to switch back. Mr Pickles approved bids from 85 councils. Only five local authorities have restored weekly collections in full, though more have reintroduced weekly pick-ups of food waste and 41 have started reward schemes to encourage recycling. He says the Government is now working with families to go green, rather than following Labour’s ‘punitive policies of fines and taxes’. Over 6million households are now receiving a weekly collection of residual waste, he says, insisting that without the Government’s intervention, the weekly bin collection would have disappeared by 2015. But he says there has been opposition to weekly collections from town hall bureaucrats and from waste industry ‘barons’ who see big money in fortnightly collections. Getting it right: Those who overfill bins or accidentally leave rubbish out on the wrong day have risked penalties of up to £1,000 . The minister’s threat to strip local authorities who do not switch back to weekly collections of some of their central government grants will infuriate council bosses. But he insists radical further steps are required. The Local Government Secretary insists it is quite possible to increase recycling rates while also offering weekly  collections of all rubbish. He will point to the example of Windsor and Maidenhead, which has increased recycling by 35 per cent by offering households incentives such as shopping vouchers or loyalty card points. Mr Pickles suggests councils should introduce innovative technology such as ‘mechanical biological treatment’ facilities, where rubbish is sorted mechanically into recyclable items and those that need to go to landfill. He adds: ‘I am now giving my colleagues in local government fair warning about the way life is going. I don’t see it as a penalty. It’s a recognition that they have decided they don’t need the money designed to support weekly collections.’ Today I’m making it absolutely clear that it’s wholly unreasonable to expect Government grants to go, in the long term, to councils that are operating fortnightly bin collections. That support is designed to provide weekly collections on the grounds of public health. This is a basic service that people expect. I’m not going to do this immediately because I recognise councils have contracts that they may be bound into for some time. But councils should be in no doubt that we will change the way this funding works. 'The public pay a lot of money in council tax - the typical bill is £120 a month. I believe that people deserve proper frontline services in return' The public pay a lot of money in council tax – the typical bill is £120 a month. I believe that people deserve proper frontline services in return and there is nothing more essential than regular rubbish and recycling collections. Under Labour, council tax doubled and bin collections halved. Town hall bureaucrats spied on residents and fined them if they made a simple mistake of breaking barmy and complex rules and regulations. Fortnightly collections weren’t a local choice - Labour politicians and Whitehall pen-pushers cajoled and bullied councils into cutting collections. The Government’s bin quango, WRAP, told councils to make the cuts after local elections - to avoid democratic opposition. Another quango, the Audit Commission, marked down councils in their Whitehall inspections if they didn’t adopt fortnightly collections. It was Disraeli’s Public Health Act 1875 which introduced a duty on local authorities to collect rubbish. This was enhanced by the Conservative-led Government’s Public Health Act 1936, obliging councils to collect household waste weekly. 'It was Disraeli’s Public Health Act 1875 which introduced a duty on local authorities to collect rubbish' Then, in a 2001 Whitehall restructuring, Tony Blair split waste policy away from local government services – and cuts to services began. For all of Labour’s talk on human rights, I believe it’s a fundamental right for every Englishman and woman to be able to put the remnants of their chicken tikka masala in their bin without having to wait two weeks for it to be collected. So, back in 2008, David Cameron pledged to Daily Mail readers that we sack Labour’s trash policy of imposing fortnightly rubbish collections for one and all. We have delivered on that pledge, as well as scrapping Labour’s plans for new bin taxes, and are changing the law to ban unfair bin fines. We have also now delivered a quarter-of-a-billion-pound fund which will help councils support weekly collections. This cash comes on top of the standard funding councils already get from us and from £23billion of taxpayers’ money raised via council tax. Our Weekly Collection Support Scheme will help more than 6million households across England receive a weekly collection, and champion innovation and new technology. 'I’ve little doubt that, without our . decisive action, the weekly bin collection in England would have gone . for good by the end of this Parliament' There are a further 4million households continuing to receive weekly collections outside this scheme. I’ve little doubt that, without our decisive action, the weekly bin collection in England would have gone for good by the end of this Parliament, looking at the experience of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. The usual suspects have been out in force to say we can’t have weekly bins – Industry bin barons who smell the whiff of easy money in fortnightly collections and municipal bin bullies. They want you to believe the fortnightly collection is the only way. In reality, it was their failure to negotiate decent contracts that lead to unnecessary expense. Weekly collections can actually be cheaper. So this scheme has bagged the Labour myth that fortnightly rubbish collections are needed to increase recycling or save money. I will now be working with Owen Paterson, the new Environment Secretary, to spread best practice on weekly collections, change dyed-in-the-wool attitudes and challenge shoddy and shady municipal practices. Despite the need to tackle Labour’s deficit, councils across England this year will still be spending £114billion – roughly £5,000 per household. I will be asking why councils can’t provide a weekly collection in return for their central government funding.","Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles warns councils in article for Mail .

Jailed: McGrath was sent to prison for 22 months after admitting dangerous driving, endangering rail passengers and aggravated vehicle taking . A boy racer jumped out of a moving car as it rolled over a level crossing just yards from the front of a departing train. Ricky McGrath, 22, was trying to evade police when he leapt from the driver's seat on the wrong side of the road. The 22-year-old was jailed for 22 months at Norwich Crown Court yesterday. Judge Stephen Holt said it . was a miracle his ‘terrifying driving’ had not killed anyone. After he jumped clear the black Audi . A4 rolled under the descending barrier 65ft in front of a . train which was just about to leave the platform at Watlington station. The . empty car only just made it under the nearest barrier, which was . descending, before coming to a halt under the far side barrier. First . Capital Connect, which runs the train services through Watlington near . King's Lynn, Norfolk, said luck had stopped him causing a 'major . accident'. Police . pursued McGrath on September 30 after spotting him overtake at speed in a . 30mph zone and reach speeds up to 70mph in the borrowed Audi. Scroll down for video .

Lucky: McGrath runs over the crossing despite the barriers closing as a train prepares to depart just 20 metres away . Chase: McGrath reaches the other side safely but his trailing car, both highlighted, gets trapped in the barriers. Train company First Capital Connect said his 'reckless actions could have caused a major accident' Reckless: The Audi is allowed to slowly roll across the tracks. Judge Holt said: 'Had a train ploughed into the car, one shudders to think what would have happened.' CCTV images taken by cameras at the . station show McGrath, who has 16 previous convictions, jump from the car . and then run ahead of the moving vehicle over the crossing. Other . images show police in pursuit stopping their patrol cars and running . after McGrath although they did not follow him over the tracks. McGrath of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, admitted dangerous driving, endangering rail passengers and aggravated vehicle taking. He also admitted escaping from custody after fleeing the dock during his first hearing after arrest. He was also banned from driving for three years at the hearing yesterday. A . First Capital Connect spokesman said: 'Luckily no-one was hurt. But . this man’s reckless action could have caused a major accident, injuring . or claiming the lives of scores of people.' 'Terrifying': The empty car came to rest trapped under the barriers. Judge said it is a miracle no one was killed by Ricky McGrath's 'terrifying driving' Trains were delayed for up to 13 minutes after he abandoned the car at the level crossing. Judge Holt told McGrath he had an ‘appalling record’ for someone who was still only aged 22. He . added: 'You were not to know whether a train was coming or not. Had a . train ploughed into the car, one shudders to think what would have . happened.' Prosecutor Nick . Methold said that McGrath had tried to get away by leaping from the . moving vehicle as he drove up to the level crossing. He said: 'The barriers were . coming down and the car continued underneath the barriers. He got out of . the car while it was still moving and the car went through without him . in it. 'It went through the first set of barriers and nearly the second set of barriers when there was a train at the station.' McGrath was later arrested and brought before King’s Lynn magistrates the next day, but he fled from the dock. He was recaptured seven days later when he was stopped in a car on the A17 at Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire. McGrath . also took a VW Golf on July 27 this year and drove it at up to 115mph . on the A47 in Cambridgeshire before police used a stinger device to . puncture his tyres and stop him. He was pursued by police for ten miles and drove at 90mph as he overtook a line of cars, forcing oncoming traffic to swerve. He also drove at 80mph through a 40mph zone. Andrew . Cogan, defending, said McGrath was a 'realist' and knew he would be . going to prison, but he deserved credit for his guilty pleas. He . said 'There is no suggestion whatever there was any driving under the . influence of any sort of substance, whether it be drugs or drink.' McGrath . was jailed for four months for escaping custody, nine months for . dangerous driving and a further nine months for aggravated vehicle . taking, all to run consecutively . He was sentenced to nine months, to run concurrently, for endangering rail passengers and ordered to pay £100 costs.

A father has been charged with killing his 23-year-old son, after he allegedly engineered what appeared to be a gruesome accident four years ago. Karl Karlsen, 52, of Romulus, New York, told police that he found Levi Karlsen's lifeless body in the family barn in November 2008. It appeared that the pickup truck that Levi was working on had slipped off its jack and crushed him to death. The death was ruled as a 'tragic accident' but investigators reopened the case on new information in March. Well-planned accident: Police believe that Karl Karlsen staged the death of his 23-year-old son in order to collect life insurance money . On Friday, Karl Karlsen was charged with murdering his son for insurance money. Investigators are now re-examining a house fire that killed Karlsen's first wife in 1991. Police reopened the case on Levi Karlsen's death when they discovered that just before his son died, Karl had taken out a new and large life insurance policy in Levi's name. The new policy named Karl as sole beneficiary instead of Levi's two young children. Investigators then took another look at . the circumstances surrounding the alleged accident. They concluded that . Karl Karlsen had made the pickup truck fall on his son, crushing and trapping him under its weight. Karl then went out to a family . gathering, returning four hours later to make a show of discovering his . son's body and telling his wife, Cindy, to call 911. Karl is charged with murdering Levi, disguising it as an accident and then picking up the insurance money. 'To think that a father could cause a vehicle to fall off a jack . crushing his son and then leave for four hours, knowing all the time . that his son was pinned under the truck apparently dead, is . unconscionable,' Seneca County Sheriff Jack Stenberg said. Levi Karlsen, father of two young children, was crushed to death by a pickup truck at his family's farm . 'Then, to put on an act for arriving first responders was part of a well-planned event staged by Karl Karlsen,' Stenberg added. But this might not be the first time Karlsen has claimed insurance money in suspicious, possibly murderous, circumstances. Now police are looking into a fire in Karl Karlsen's former home in California that killed his first wife, Christena Karlsen, on New Year's Day in 1991. The sheriff's office declined to give further details on Saturday. But Art Alexander, Christena's father and Levi Karlsen's grandfather, told the Syracuse Post-Standard that he had always been suspicious. And Alexander's doubts had grown over the years. Karl Karlsen claimed that the fire had started while he was in the garage and that he had been able to save his son and two daughters, but not his wife. But as Alexander explains, not all the evidence adds up. Karl Karlsen has been charged with murdering his son and will be reinvestigated for a fire that killed his first wife. He collected insurance payouts on both occasions . Alexander explains that one investigator told him that the children would have been covered in soot if they had been in the house during the fire. Yet when he arrived on the scene the children were unharmed and clean. He also claims that he was shown multiple 'flash points' where the fire had started. According to Karlsen's story there should have been only one. While Alexander did have concerns he says that he couldn't confront Karlsen as he wanted to stay in touch with his family. 'I couldn’t tell him what I thought,” he told the Post-Standard. 'It would alienate me from my grandkids.' 'Just to keep it bottled up - it was the hardest thing I ever did in my life,' Alexander said. Following Friday's developments, authorities are now looking into this suspicious blaze. Karlsen received $200,000 in insurance money from this fire and moved from California to New York with his children. In New York, Karl Karlsen used this payout to buy the property in Romulus - the place where Levi Karlsen died. The family farm in upstate New York where Levi Karlsen died.

Police were called to the home and Gabriel . was taken to hospital for his injuries after suffering a broken rib, bruises to the face and a possible more serious head injury, TMZ reports. Thanksgiving drama: Gabriel Aubry, pictured here attending the same party as Halle Berry and Olivier Martinez in LA on Wednesday, was arrested after a 'brutal' brawl on Thursday . Tense: Halle and Olivier, also pictured on Wednesday, recently lost a custody battle to take Nahla to his native France . Olivier has a possible broken hand and . neck injuries. He arrived at the same Los Angeles hospital for . treatment as Gabriel around an hour after him, according to the website. The drama went down inside Halle's home at around 10am after Gabriel dropped off their daughter Nahla in a custodial handover. Martinez apparently approached Aubry and said: 'We have to move on,' - a reference to the recent custody battle which blocked Halle from moving to France with Nahla.

Protective: Gabriel was concerned his relationship with his daughter would be damaged if she moved to France . A source told gossip website TMZ: 'Gabriel went nuts,' in front of Halle and other witnesses. It is not clear whether Nahla witnessed the fight. However, details about the argument are unclear because both men were speaking in French.

He argued it would give him limited access to his . daughter, while the Cloud Atlas actress countered the privacy laws are . stronger in France and would keep Nahla safe from the paparazzi. Halle, 46 . - who split with Gabriel in 2010 - and Olivier, had put their wedding . plans on hold while the actress focused on her custody battle. Just 24 hours earlier, Halle, Oliver and Gabriel all attended an early Thanksgiving celebration in Los Angeles with Nahla. While Halle and Olivier picked up Nahla from school and took her to the party, her father took her home with him on Wednesday.

The very good years: Frank Sinatra and his loyal assistant Tony Consiglio who acted out every whim of the legendary singer . The memorable incident happened when the two friends were drinking at the Claridge Hotel in Atlantic City.

Researchers say they have become increasingly popular in the home as a cheap alternative to turning on the heating. But if the bottles are poorly made or the rubber has perished, they can explode without warning during the night. This can cause serious burns or scalds which in some cases are so serious that patients require skin grafts. Researchers say the number of hot water bottles being used in Britain has risen due to the rising cost of the heating . Researchers at Anglia Ruskin University say that the numbers needing hospital treatment for hot water bottle burns has risen in the last two years. But they say these admissions only represent a handful of the true numbers suffering injuries as most will not go to hospital. One reason for the increase is that people are buying cheap hot water bottles from abroad made from rubber that easily perishes. Furthermore the researchers say rising numbers of families are using them as a 'cost-effective' way of staying warm in the hope of saving on their energy bills. Quentin Frew, of Anglia Ruskin University, said: 'Anecdotally we have seen an increase in burns caused by hot water bottles in the last couple of years. 'It could be that more people are using them as a cost-effective way of keeping warm or it could be that people are buying cheaper hot water bottles over the internet from abroad. 'What we have seen at the hospital is only the tip of the iceberg, as the majority of these cases go unreported. People try and manage the burns themselves, often because they are embarrassed about what they have done or the area they have burnt. 'When looking at burns from hot water bottles it is sometimes difficult to say which have been caused by patient misuse and which are due to poor manufacturing standards. 'What is clear is that there is a need to increase awareness of the ability of hot water bottles to cause significant long-term burn injuries and also highlight the precautionary measures that could be taken to prevent such injuries. 'One common problem is people storing them incorrectly, which can cause the rubber to perish.' The researchers looked at the medical notes of 50 patients who had suffered burns and scalds from hot water bottles. They found that injuries took an average of 25 days to heal - three and a half weeks. And in three of the patients, including two children, the burns were so serious they needed skin grafts. In some cases patients were to blame for the injuries as they had filled bottles with boiling water that causes the rubber to wear out. The NHS does not compile figures on the numbers of patients needing treatment for hot water bottle burns. But last year more than 1,800 were admitted to hospital following injuries caused by hot water or other hot fluids, which would include hot water bottles.","Rising numbers of Britons are suffering burns from hot water bottles .

These incredible before and after aerial pictures show the destruction wreaked by Superstorm Sandy on the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. The shocking before and after photos of the New York and New Jersey shoreline reveal in minute detail how much the land was altered in just a few moments. They are part of a large-scale survey of the damage by the U.S. Geological Service, which is attempting to analyse the devastation caused to houses, public services and the lives of people from the battered seaside towns. Scroll down for video . Peaceful: View of Mantoloking, looking west along the New Jersey shore, before Superstorm Sandy hit the barrier island's wide beaches . Torn apart: Days after the storm, the beach, houses and roads are destroyed. Construction crews are seen clearing sand from roads and pushing it seaward. The yellow arrow pinpoints the same spot in the two images . Ravaged: In Seaside Heights, New Jersey - made famous by reality TV show Jersey Shore - part of the pier and its rollercoaster have been thrown into the ocean. Sediment deposited on the island is visible in the background . At risk: A view of Pelican Island, looking northwest across Fire Island, near Old Inlet - a very narrow portion of the island that has experienced breaching in previous large storms . Devastation: The island breached during Sandy, creating a new inlet. Despite the breach, the fishing shack (yellow arrow) remained standing . 'Sandy taught us yet again that not all . Cat-1 hurricanes are created equal,' said USGS Director Marcia McNutt. 'The superstorm's enormous fetch over the Atlantic produced storm surge . and wave erosion of historic proportions. 'We have seized this opportunity to gather unique data on a major coastline-altering event.' As major storms approach, the USGS conducts pre-storm and post-storm flights to gather images along the length of the coastline likely to take the hit of the storm’s landfall. Pictures from these points of impact help scientists understand which areas are likely to undergo the most severe impacts from future storms, and improves future coastal impact forecasting. When the project is complete, it will stretch from the Outer Banks of North Carolina in the South to as far north as Massachusetts. Ordinary day: Ocean Bay Park, Fire Island, New York, looking northwest across the island towards Great South Bay . Changed landscape: Overwash from the beach and narrow dunes carried sand inland towards the interior and bayside of the island, and numerous houses were destroyed or severely damaged . Life-altering: Seaside Heights, looking west along the New Jersey shore.The red arrow points to a building that was washed off of its foundation and moved about a block away from its original location . USGS oceanographer Nathaniel Plant said Sandy caused 'significant beach and dune erosion and minor disruption of infrastructure in the south, to extreme and often catastrophic erosion, overwash and sediment deposition and inundation on northern beaches like Mantoloking, New Jersey.' Overwash occurs when waves are higher than protective sand dunes, sweeping sand from the beach inland. This can wreak havoc on roads and public transport, bury buildings and put lives at risk. The photos will help USGS identify areas particularly vulnerable to severe coastal change. Before Sandy, the service predicted erosion of 91 per cent of the Delmarva coastline, 98 per cent of beaches and dunes in New Jersey and 93 per cent in New York. It recorded drastic changes on Fire Island in New York, where the beach all but disappeared overnight, seaside homes reduced to matchsticks and 3ft of sand dumped in back gardens. USGS coastal geologist Cheryl Hapke said: 'On average the dunes eroded back 70 feet - the equivalent of 30 years of change. 'Our data also showed that dunes lost as much as 10 feet of elevation.'

Call for investigation: David Davis said it was 'highly unusual' for a senior official to be involved in the detail of an industrial deal . A leading Tory yesterday heaped pressure on Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood over his role in the controversial European merger of defence giant BAE. David Davis said the Defence Select Committee – which is probing the proposed link up between BAE and civil aviation firm EADS – should question Britain’s top mandarin, saying it was ‘highly unusual’ for such a senior official to be involved in the detail of an industrial deal. Sir Jeremy’s role has raised eyebrows since he worked for four years at Morgan Stanley, the investment bank advising BAE Systems on the £28billion merger with the Franco-German firm. The Mail revealed earlier this week that he has held four private meetings with BAE over the last 15 months, plus two with Morgan Stanley and another with EADS – which will control 60 per cent of the new firm. Mr Davis said it ‘would be a good idea’ for Sir Jeremy to give evidence to the select committee. He added: ‘I do think it’s highly unusual for someone as senior as the Cabinet Secretary to be involved in a deal like this. ‘You can imagine senior staff in the Department of Business and the Ministry of Defence taking an interest but quite why the Cabinet Secretary is involved, I’m not at all sure. It’s not something that’s within his purview. ‘I’m sure he’s been utterly proper and obeyed all the rules but the worry is that the judge of whether a civil servant has behaved appropriately is the Cabinet Secretary himself. It would have made more sense if he had delegated to other officials.’ MPs on the Defence Select Committee . say they are seeking to call senior officials from Downing Street and . the Ministry of Defence to give evidence about the deal. Collaboration: BAE,which may be merged with aviation firm EADS, helped to build the Eurofighter . Sources . close to Sir Jeremy said he would be prepared to appear before the . committee but said the onus would be on the MPs to submit a formal . invitation. Yesterday Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg backed the deal, saying it would further the cause of European defence integration. His intervention is also controversial since it pre-empts a decision by Business Secretary Vince Cable about whether to refer the merger to the Competition Commission. And his call for European defence . cooperation will be a red rag to many Tories, who fear the deal will see . Britain’s biggest defence firm fall partly under the control of the . French and German governments, which own shares in EADS. 'Backing the bid': Prime Minister David Cameron . In . an interview with Bloomberg Television, Mr Clegg said: ‘The two . companies are making a case, a strong case, in favour of this merger. ‘I . personally have always been in favour, over time, of greater . consolidation in the European defence industry.’ Mr Clegg’s words will . fuel concerns among Tory MPs that the Government has pre-judged the . affair. Senior officials have already revealed that David Cameron is backing the bid as long as he receives reassurances that it will not damage relations with the Americans, who are concerned military secrets will be compromised. And Mr Cable made clear he had no objection in principle when he told a Lib Dem fringe meeting on Monday he didn’t ‘worry about foreign ownership’ of British companies – although he refused to comment on the specifics of the deal. Former shadow home secretary Mr Davis said: ‘They shouldn’t be briefing anything until the bid has been through the proper process. This calls for cool, measured judgment first and activity later, not the other way around.’ He added: ‘It’s very hard to see the French allowing their primary defence company to fall into foreign ownership. ‘This is very old-fashioned industrial politics, the idea that you bring big companies together to make even bigger companies. It has been a proven fallacy since the days of British Leyland.' A spokesman for the Cabinet Secretary insisted it was ‘standard practice’ for him to show an interest in a deal involving a major government contractor like BAE. He added: ‘He is not the lead official on this, his role is no different from the role he plays on other major issues requiring high level ministerial involvement and coordination across departments.’","Concerns over Sir Jeremy Heywood's role in proposed £28billion link up between BAE and EADS .

The number of women dying from ovarian cancer has fallen by a quarter in 20 years thanks to  earlier diagnosis and better treatment, say researchers. And the length of time the women survived for also increased, especially amongst women aged between 40 and 60. Ovarian cancer is known as the ‘silent killer’ because it is notoriously difficult to diagnose and is often detected only once it has spread to other organs. It remains the fifth most common form of cancer amongst women, with 6,500 cases diagnosed in Britain a year. The number of women dying from ovarian cancer has fallen by a quarter in 20 years . Scientists from the National Cancer Intelligence Network compared data on mortality and survival from 1989 with the latest  figures from 2009. They found that mortality rates had fallen from 11.9 per cent per 100,000 women in  1989 to 8.8 per cent in 2009 – a drop of 26 per cent. And almost three quarters of sufferers survived for at least a year, with 44 per cent still alive five  years later. In 1989, a little over half of patients lived beyond a year and only a third survived for five years. The biggest improvements in survival rates occurred amongst 40 to 60-year-olds. Rates for those aged 45 to 49 rose almost 50 per cent in ten years, with 61 per cent living for at least a year. Experts believe these women have responded particularly well to national awareness campaigns alerting them to the early warning signs of the disease. Silent killer: Ovarian cancer is difficult to diagnose and is often detected only once it has spread to other organs . This has coincided with improvements in care, with patients usually referred to specialised gynaecology centres run by highly experienced surgeons and consultants. But the NCIN – which is funded by the Government and cancer charities to carry out research – found that survival rates have barely improved amongst the elderly. Only 24 per cent of over-85s lived for at least a year, compared with 23 per cent living this long in 1989. Elderly women may also be less aware of the symptoms and unwilling to trouble their GP, even if they suspect something is wrong. Lead author Andy Nordin, a consultant . gynaecologist at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust, . said: ‘This drop in deaths may reflect improvements in detecting and . treating the disease, such as improvements in scanning, surgery and . chemotherapy treatments. ‘Additionally, . over the past decade, ovarian cancer patients throughout the UK have . experienced better management due to organisation of ovarian cancer care . in specialist gynaecological cancer centres, planning of care by teams . of cancer experts and specialist surgery by specially trained and . accredited gynaecological oncologists.’ A number of charities have run awareness campaigns over the past decade alerting women to the warning signs of the disease, which include bloating, loss of appetite and severe pain. Patients and GPs can often confuse these symptoms with irritable bowel syndrome or period pains. The NHS is hoping to improve diagnosis rates and last year a £20 blood test capable of detecting the illness was made available to GPs for the first time. Chris Carrigan, head of the NCIN, said: ‘As ovarian cancer can be very hard to diagnose and treat, this report was important to help us learn as much as we can about the numbers of women who develop the disease, how many survive and how many die.’","Length of time woman survived also increased, especially among 40-60s .

Singer Beverley Knight, who presented Mrs Lawrence’s award, said: ‘It is a joy to present such a quietly courageous, determined and humble woman with an award. ‘I have admired her for years – the grace with which she has dealt with injustice after cruel injustice on both sides of the law to eventually see some resolution. Stabbed: Doreen Lawrence was praised for her courage and tenacity during her tireless campaign against racism following the murder of her son Stephen (pictured) in 1993 . ‘She is the embodiment of the saying, “Never give up”.’ Yesterday’s award was the latest in a series of accolades for Mrs Lawrence, 59, who founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust to help young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. In 2003, she was awarded an OBE for services to community relations and this summer was chosen as a flagbearer at the Opening Ceremony of the Olympics, alongside boxer Muhammad Ali and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, president of the Women of the Year awards, said Mrs Lawrence had ‘campaigned tirelessly for the victims of racist crime and reform of the police service’. Britain’s female Olympic and Paralympic stars were also winners at the awards, and crime writer PD James was given the lifetime achievement honour. More than 30 British Olympic and Paralympic medallists – including swimmer Rebecca Adlington and gymnast Beth Tweddle – attended the ceremony in central London. Lindsay Nicholson, of Good Housekeeping magazine, who presented an award to the sports stars, said: ‘London 2012 was, undeniably, “the Women’s Olympics”. Our incredible Olympians and Paralympians broke new records and won more medals than ever before. But, for me, most importantly they sent out a message to all young women that there is so much more to aspire to, physically, than being size zero.’ Women’s rights activist Zainab Salbi and Alzheimer’s campaigner Kate Woolveridge were also named as Women of the Year winners.

Kate Middleton once honed her schoolgirl hockey skills there, and a young John Betjeman drew inspiration for his first poems. But the playing fields of Marlborough College were host to a different type of boarder yesterday – a convoy of travellers. Visitors to the £30,000-a-year school were greeted by the sight of cart horses grazing on the carefully tended sports fields, now a car park for seven caravans, two trucks and a tarmac lorry. New arrivals: A horse grazes on the playing fields at Marlborough College yesterday after a convoy of travellers set up camp . Travellers speak to police in the grounds of the exclusive school . Children and their dogs used the fields as a playground, just weeks before the school’s more privileged pupils are due to return from their summer holidays. Police were called to the school on Thursday after the convoy of some 15 caravans, cars, trucks and lorries pulled in through the school’s gates. The 25-strong group of travellers had been evicted from an illegal camp site in Newbury, Berkshire, just hours earlier. Police monitored the convoy until it crossed the Wiltshire county border but the travellers were then seemingly unchecked as they drove up Marlborough’s historic High Street and through the school gates. Captain: Kate Middleton playing hockey during her days at Marlborough . They eventually came to a halt opposite the Elmhurst boarding house, where a young Kate Middleton was a sixth-former and house prefect, and was rumoured to have had a poster of Prince William on her wall. She was also a hockey captain at the school, and would have spent long hours training on the playing fields, on the banks of the River Kennet. Yesterday more caravans attempted to join the makeshift camp, but were blocked by police and private security guards. Onlooker Jacqui Broadbridge said: ‘We could hardly believe our eyes when this convoy of lorries, caravans and horseboxes drove through.’ A police spokesman said the travellers had said they would leave before Monday, adding: ‘We are monitoring the situation.’ Jonathan Leigh, the master of Marlborough College, said: ‘We are pursuing all legal steps to remove these people as soon as possible.’ If the travellers do not leave willingly, the school may have to consider legal action to evict them.Ironically, it has just installed a multi-million pound security system upgrade but a worker said the convoy had used the only gate on the campus which could not be closed. The estate worker, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Not a spot of this place isn’t covered by a camera. But once they started pouring in there was no way to stop them.’ The school was founded in 1843 for the education of the sons of Church of England clergy, and is now considered one of Britain’s leading private schools. Other alumni include Princess Eugenie and Prime Minister’s wife Samantha Cameron. War poet Siegfried Sassoon, singer Chris de Burgh and former poet laureate John Betjeman were also pupils. Travellers have taken residence on the playing fields on the grounds of historic Malborough College in Wiltshire . A group of the travellers' children set out some chairs as they make themselves at home . Betjeman later wrote of his hatred of sports at the school, writing: ‘The dread of beatings! Dread of being late! And, greatest dread of all, the dread of games!’ The school is described in the Good Schools Guide as a ‘famous, designer label, co-ed boarding school’. It began admitting girls in 1968. The Duchess of Cambridge (4th from left back row) was a member of the prestigious school's hockey team . Residents are furious that the travellers have chosen to use the beautiful grounds as their new site . Police say they are powerless to evict the travellers as the independent day school is private property .","Arrived there after being evicted from an illegal site in Berkshire .

Scandal on Sesame Street: Kevin Clash, pictured with Elmo, allegedly had sex with a 16-year-old boy when he was 45 . The voice of Elmo in Sesame Street sent graphic emails to a sexual partner who claims the puppeteer slept with him when he was underage. Kevin Clash exchanged messages with his accuser in 2010 in which he apologised for constantly talking about sex and promised to make all of his 'dreams come true'. Clash, who has left the show in the wake of the accusations, told the man almost 30 years his junior that he loved him and offered to buy him a ticket to visit him in New York, it has emerged. The Sesame Street stalwart, who has worked on the show since the mid-80s, admits to having a sexual . relationship with the accuser but insists it only took place after the younger man was an adult. Clash, 52, took a leave of . absence from the children's show after the 23-year-old contacted the programme's lawyers and told them he had a sexual . relationship with the puppeteer seven years ago. At the time of the alleged relationship, Clash was 45 and the boy was 16 - with the age of consent 17 in New York. In the latest emails published by TMZ, sent well after the accuser turned 18, Clash wrote: 'I'm sorry that I keep talking about sex with you, its driving me insane.' He added: 'I want you to know that I love . you and I will never hurt you. I'm here to protect you and make sure . your dreams come true... 'I'll have my assistant book a ticket for you to come to NY and we can talk about this in person.' Clash said he will now focus on fighting the allegations, which he described as false and defamatory. He said the relationship was between two consenting adults that he was deeply . saddened that the younger man was 'trying to make it into something it was not.' Allegations: Clash has left the popular children's show to fight the accusations . The . accuser reportedly felt he was being silenced after his initial meeting with Sesame Street lawyers. He is now being represented by Andreozzi and Associates - the firm that worked with one of the victims . in the Jerry Sandusky child rape case. In August, the accuser's lawyers wrote a . letter to Sesame Street accusing the programme of trying to 'discredit . the victim in order to protect its . employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters.' The letter also claimed the show's attitude 'places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of . a young man.' Sesame Workshop officials, however, said they found the  the allegation of underage sex was . unsubstantiated after a thorough . investigation. Iconic: Clash, left, who has voiced Elmo for two decades, admits he had a relationship with the man, but only after the accuser was an adult . They say that rather than trying to hush up the accuser, they asked for evidence of his allegations, which was not received. TMZ reported they had seen an email supposedly sent to the accuser by Clash, . acknowledging they had the affair when he was 16, but officials believe it is fake as they say the . accuser never mentioned such an email existed. Sesame Street disciplined Mr Clash . for inappropriate use of company email after they found his messages to . the accuser, but they reportedly did not indicate an illegal sexual . relationship. They said the divorced father of a 19-year-old girl had shown poor judgment, but claimed . his leave of absence was to allow him to defend his reputation in the wake of the damaging allegations. Clash's ex-wife, Gina, declined to comment, but a friend who answered the door at her Baltimore home told the New York Daily News that the former nurse is 'surviving'. In the spotlight: Clash, who joined Sesame Street in the mid-80s, sent his accuser emails promising to make his dreams come true . A neighbour who did not wish to be identified defended Clash, saying: 'He was really good to her and the family. He's a really nice guy.' Sesame Workshop insisted the scandal surrounding Clash does not mean the end of Elmo. 'Elmo is bigger than any one person,' the company said. Clash has been Elmo's puppeteer for two decades, performing on the show as well as for PBS specials, DVD releases and TV movies, while earning nine Daytime Emmy Awards. He eventually assumed the title of Sesame Street's Senior Puppet Coordinator and Muppet Captain, while also directing and producing show segments and TV specials. He published an autobiography about his career in 2006 called My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud. Earlier this year he appeared in Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey, a documentary detailing Clash's journey from a childhood obsession with puppets to assuming his role on the iconic show.","Kevin Clash, 52, told his accuser, now 23, he would 'make his dreams come true' and offered to pay for him to visit New York .

Modern-day Rasputin: Thierry Tilly, pictured today at the court of Bordeaux, southwestern France, persuaded 11 relatives to sell off their chateau and possessions . A British conman who brainwashed three generations of an aristocratic French family into handing over their £3.6million fortune was today jailed for eight years. Thierry Tilly used mental manipulation to convince the Vedrines clan of a secret plot to kill them, leaving the 11 relatives so scared they locked themselves in their chateau near Bordeaux for years. Over the course of almost a decade, the 48-year-old from Oxford persuaded the family - aged from 16 to 89 - to sell off their possessions and their turreted mansion. Tilly has been nicknamed 'the guru' by local media and compared to Rasputin, a Russian mystic thought to have influenced Emperor Nicholas II. Tilly became a confidante of the landed Vedrines in 2000 and gradually persuaded them to pour their money into a fake Canadian charity he claimed was set up to pay their 'protectors'. In a case that has fascinated France, Tilly was accused of using mental manipulation and violence to convince them that they were in mortal danger from a cabal of freemasons, a European secret society and paedophiles. The family claims he brainwashed them into believing they were the lost descendants of an ancient society called 'The Balance of the World'. For five years, they barely left their castle in Monflanquin, 100 miles east of Bordeaux, terrified they would be killed. Prosecutors called Tilly, who told the family that he could protect them, the 'Leonardo da Vinci of mental manipulation'. The court in Bordeaux was told that Tilly used his 'superior intelligence' to ingratiate himself with the family. French-born Tilly was today convicted of . arbitrary detention, using violence against vulnerable people and . abusing people weakened by 'psychological subjection'. Manipulated: Christine de Védrines, pictured today with husband Philippe, says she was locked in a room for several months, deprived of food and beaten for resisting Tilly's lies . His accomplice, Jacques Gonzalez, 65, was sentenced to four years in prison. Christine de Vedrines, who first alerted police to Tilly's actions, said today: 'Eight years is a small price to pay for . what he did to our family and children. The trial is behind us and . we will do everything to rebuild.' His lawyer Alexandre Novion had argued that the Vedrines, from 13th-century village of Monflanquin in southwestern France, had acted willingly. 'These 11 family members aren't ill, . have their feet on the ground, a level of self-awareness,' he said. 'Eleven people . manipulated by mysterious forces by a single man? The legal basis for . case is weak.' Despite the conviction, Tilly remained . defiant, invoking his right as a British citizen and saying he would . take his case to the European Court of Justice, news agency Sipa reported. His lawyer, however, said he was not aware that his client was a British citizen. Tilly was deemed mentally stable during . his trial, and French media have reported that he has a history of lies and . exaggerations. Mind control: When Jean Marchand, left, denounced Tilly as a fraudster, his wife Ghislaine and son Francois, behind, branded him an 'agent of evil' He claimed before the Bordeaux court that he was a . member of the Habsburg dynasty, that he once almost played football for . Marseille and that he knew former French President Francois Mitterrand. His victims included Guillemette de Védrines, who died in 2010 aged 97, her three children Philippe, Ghislaine and Charles-Henri, the two brothers' wives, Brigitte and Christine, and five adult grandchildren. Devious pair: Tilly's accomplice Jacques Gonzalez, pictured, was sentenced to four years in prison today . Tilly's first victim was Ghislaine de Védrines, 66, who he met when he worked for her Paris secretarial college in 1999. After barely registering the 'uncharismatic' man for the first year, she gradually found herself drawn to him, and introduced him to her family, the court heard. Tilly claimed they were protected by a global network of secretive grandees, whose head, Mr Gonzalez, was a cousin of King Juan Carlos of Spain. As scrutiny intensified in France, Tilly convinced most of the family to decamp to Oxford, where they often failed to pay rent and were taken to court. Anyone who resisted was punished severely. Christine de Védrines, 62, says she was locked in a room for several months, deprived of food and beaten. She says he insisted she knew the number of a bank account that would lead to the lost treasure of the Knights Templar. When Ghislaine's husband, Jean Marchand, a journalist, denounced Tilly as a charlatan, his wife and two children branded him an 'agent of evil'. Mr Marchand alerted the authorities, who refused to act because there were no legal complaints from the rest of the family. Tilly was finally arrested in Switzerland in 2009 following a complaint by Christine, who escaped after confiding in her employer in Oxford. When Mr Gonzalez was arrested in 2010, police found a BMW 645 with €86,000 in the boot, as well as expensive watches, bottles of fine wine and an 'opulent wardrobe'. The case raises echoes of another . controversial trial involving France's richest woman, 90-year-old . L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, who was swindled by a French tax . lawyer into giving him a private Seychelles island.","The 11 relatives locked themselves in their turreted chateau for five years .

Women should freeze their eggs when they hit 30 as an ‘insurance policy’ for having babies later on, according to researchers. Anyone who hasn’t met Mr Right - or is intent on pursuing their career -should consider paying up to £5,000 to ‘bank’ their eggs. Not only will their chances of having babies be higher, say researchers from the US Government, they will also save money as they won’t have to pay for IVF later in life. Women who freeze their eggs at 30 and have them reinserted ten years later are five times more likely to get pregnant . In Britain, the cost of removing and freezing a woman’s eggs can be as high as £5,000 in addition to an annual fee of £200 for every year they are stored. But the academics have calculated that if women wait until they are 40 before trying for children, they may need several rounds of IVF which will cost double this amount. And by this stage there is no guarantee they will ever become pregnant - even with IVF - as their eggs are of far poorer quality. The researchers claim if these women were to freeze their eggs aged 30 and then have them re-inserted ten years later, their chances of having a baby would be five times greater. The experts have worked out that a 40-year-old woman who uses eggs frozen when she was 30 has a 75 per cent chance of falling pregnant. This compares to a 40-year-old on IVF who has less than a 15 per cent chance. At present very few women in Britain bank their eggs unless they are about to undergo cancer treatment . Dr Kate Devine, from the National Institutes of Health, the research agency of the US’s Department of Health, said: ‘You take a 30-year-old lawyer - she knows that she wants children someday but she’s getting concerned because she knows that ten years goes by before she’s in that position. ‘So her options at that point are to freeze eggs or not to freeze eggs.’ Addressing the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s conference in San Diego, she added: . ‘If you’re sure you’re not going to get pregnant until you’re 40, the younger the better. ‘So long as you freeze your eggs before 35 you have a 75 per cent chance of having a live birth.’ But she added that if a woman ‘took her chances’ and waited until she was 40 to try for a baby, she may need several cycles of IVF - each costing at least £3,000  - before she was successful. At present very few women in Britain bank their eggs unless they are about to undergo cancer treatment as it can damage their reproductive system. The process involves them firstly being given high doses hormones –  called gonadotropins – to stimulate their ovaries and make them produce high numbers of eggs. Once the eggs have reached a certain size, they are removed via a fine needle and placed in liquid nitrogen which freezes them at -196 C (-320F). Normally between 10 and 12 eggs are stored at a time – by law in Britain they can only be kept for a maximum of ten years. But the procedure is relatively new in Britain and only a handful of babies have been born from frozen eggs – the first was in 2002. The exact numbers are not known but it is believed to be fewer than ten. Nonetheless research shows that rising numbers of women in their 20s and 30s are considering the option. A woman undergoing IVF treatment at 40 has less than 1 15 per cent chance of getting pregnant . Only last month a poll of 3,000 women aged 28 to 45 by Red magazine found a fifth had considered freezing their eggs for use later on. Oxford academic Dr Dagan Wells backed the idea and said women were increasingly waiting until their late 30s before trying for a baby. By the time they realised they need IVF they may well be 40 by which time success rates are ‘really low’ he added. Josaphine Quintavalle, of the group Comment on Reproductive Ethics warned that in rare cases, egg freezing can cause fatal blood clots. She said: ‘Egg harvesting is a very uncomfortable invasive process, and can actually go seriously wrong. ‘Keep searching is my advice and spend the money on finding Mr Right rather than enriching the IVF providers.’ Dr Devine added that some women would never need to use their frozen eggs as they may decide to have babies a couple of years later-having met Mr Right or deciding to put career on hold. ‘Obviously some women will never need to use their eggs. This is just an insurance policy of sorts.’","Women who freeze their eggs at 30 and have them reinserted years later will have a higher chance of getting pregnant .
At a cost of £5,000, it could work out cheaper than IVF which has a much lower success rate .

Court victory: Adrian Smith wrote on Facebook that gay marriages were an 'equality too far' A Christian housing worker who was demoted for criticising gay marriage on Facebook today won his battle to get his job back. Adrian Smith, 55, lost his managerial position, had his salary cut by 40 per cent and was given a final written warning by Manchester's Trafford Housing Trust after posting that gay weddings in churches were 'an equality too far'. Mr Smith was today awarded less than £100 compensation at London’s High Court after winning his legal action for breach of contract. Mr Justice Briggs, ruling in his favour today, said he had 'real disquiet' about the limited financial award for Mr Smith, who was only paid the difference between his . contractual salary and the amount he earned for the 12 . weeks after he took on the reduced role. The comments were not visible to the . general public and were posted outside work time, but the trust said he . broke its code of conduct by expressing religious or political views . which might upset co-workers. Matthew Gardiner, chief executive at the housing trust, said: 'We fully accept the court's decision and I have made a full and sincere apology to Adrian. 'At the time we believed we were taking the appropriate action following discussions with our employment solicitors and taking into account his previous disciplinary record. 'We have always vigorously denied allegations that the Trust had breached an employee's rights to freedom of religious expression under Human Rights and Equalities legislation and, in a written judgment handed down on 21st March 2012, a district judge agreed that these matters should be struck out. 'This has been a case about the interpretation of our code of conduct and the use of social media by our managers. 'This case has highlighted the challenges that businesses face with the increased use of social media and we have reviewed our documentation and procedures to avoid a similar situation arising in the future. Adrian remains employed by the Trust and I am pleased this matter has now concluded.' In response to the amount of money awarded to Mr Smith, he added: 'Sadly, the first time we knew that court proceedings had been issued against us was when we read about it in the Press and we had little option but to defend our position. 'We had tried to come to a settlement with Mr Smith which would have resulted in him receiving 10 times the amount he was claiming, but he chose to reject this offer.' Supported: Mr Justice Briggs ruled in his favour at London's High Court, pictured, and his company has had to apologise and pay him damages . He said the Trust would be making no further comment. The dispute began in February 2011, when Mr Smith posted a link to an article from the BBC News website on his Facebook page. The headline was 'Gay church marriages get go ahead' and he added the comment, 'an equality too far'. Two colleagues read the remark, which . could be viewed by friends and friends of friends, and one of them . posted a response asking Mr Smith to explain what he meant. The . next evening he posted: 'I don't understand why people who have no . faith and don't believe in Christ would want to get hitched in church. Difficult: Matthew Gardiner, chief executive of the Trafford Housing Trust, said the case highlighted the challenges that businesses face with the increased use of social media . 'The Bible is quite specific that marriage is for men and women. If the state wants to offer civil marriage to the same sex then that is up to the state; but the state shouldn't impose its rules on places of faith and conscience.' The judge said that the trust did not have a right to demote Mr Smith as his Facebook postings did not amount to misconduct, and the demotion imposed by way of purported disciplinary sanction constituted a breach of contract. He admitted he felt 'uncomfortable' that he had only awarded 'very modest' damages to Mr Smith. 'I must admit to real disquiet about the financial outcome of this case,' he said. 'Mr Smith was taken to task for doing nothing wrong, suspended and subjected to a disciplinary procedure which wrongly found him guilty of gross misconduct, and then demoted to a non-managerial post with an eventual 40 per cent reduction in salary. 'The breach of contract which the trust thereby committed was serious and repudiatory. 'A conclusion that his damages are limited to less than £100 leaves the uncomfortable feeling that justice has not been done to him in the circumstances.' Change of fortunes: The Trafford Housing Trust made 'a full and sincere' apology. Pictured, the front page of the organisation's website . He added that if Mr Smith had commenced proceedings for unfair dismissal in the Employment Tribunal, rather than starting an action for breach of contract in the county court, there was every reason to suppose that the tribunal would have been able to award him substantial compensation if it felt he had been unfairly treated. If financial stringency made it practically impossible for Mr Smith to bring such proceedings, then the injustice he had suffered, although very real, was something the court was unable to alleviate by a substantial award. Later, Mr Smith said in a statement: 'I’m pleased to have won my case for breach of contract today. The judge exonerated me and made clear that my comments about marriage were in no way ""misconduct"". 'My award of damages has been limited to less than £100 - but that is for technical legal reasons and the judge made it clear he was not able to award me a much larger sum. 'But I didn’t do this for the money - I did this because there is an important principle at stake. 'Britain is a free country where people have freedom of speech, and I am pleased that the judge’s ruling underlines that important principle. 'But this sad case should never have got this far. Long ago, Trafford Housing Trust should have held their hands up and admitted they made a terrible mistake. Had they done this then my life would not have been turned upside down and my family and I would not have had to endure a living nightmare. 'However, to the bitter end, they claimed I had broken equality policies and brought the Trust into disrepute - all because, like millions of people, I support traditional marriage. 'Something has poisoned the atmosphere in Britain, where an honest man like me can be punished for making perfectly polite remarks about the importance of marriage. 'I have won today. But what will tomorrow bring? I am fearful that, if marriage is redefined, there will be more cases like mine - and if the law of marriage changes people like me may not win in court. 'Does the Prime Minister want to create a society where people like me, people who believe in traditional marriage, are treated as outcasts? That may not be his intention, but, as my treatment shows, that’s what will happen. 'The Prime Minister should think very carefully about the impact of redefining marriage on ordinary people.'","Adrian Smith said on Facebook that gay weddings were 'an equality too far'

An ex-rugby player who feared undergoing surgery for his battered nose would leave him resembling Micheal Jackson has won £26,000 after surgeons botched the operation. Carl Egonu, from Plymouth, wanted to streamline his nose after years of playing the high-octane sport. The concerned 49-year-old spoke to his doctor about ending up with unusual features similar to those of the late pop star - but he now has a raised scar and a permanent patch of darkened skin on the end of his nose. Distressing difference: Carl Egonu wanted his nose streamlined after years of playing rugby. Left, the 49-year-old before the surgery, and right, with an obvious dark and raised scar that can never be removed . Mr Egonu said he became depressed and withdrawn after the private operation at Nuffield Hospital, Plymouth, Devon in March 2006. The dermabrasion operation left what Judge Christopher Gardner QC described as a 'significant cosmetic defect' on the end of his nose, which he will have for the rest of his life. Mental effects: Mr Egonu said the surgery made him depressed and he even tried hypnotherapy to help him cope . Although the sportsman has now managed to put his scar to the back of his mind, the judge said there was no doubt it had badly affected him and he even had a session of hypnotherapy to come to terms with the blemish. Judge Gardner said: 'The resultant appearance of his nose is something that people - including his own children - tend to ask him about, and the experts agree that attempts to camouflage or skin graft will not assist.' Mr Egonu, a building surveyor, sued the cosmetic surgeon who operated on him, Dr Adeshola Adeniran, who also carries out an NHS role as a locum consultant at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth. Mr Egonu’s lawyers made no criticism of the medic’s surgical skills, but said he failed to warn his patient about the possible risks of the procedure, which was meant to give his nose a cleaner, smoother profile. The judge added: 'Having reached an age where he had finished playing rugby - in which sport his nose had been injured on occasions but not fractured - he consulted Dr Adeniran to ascertain whether the shape of his nose, the bulbous tip of which he felt was too large, could be made more streamlined, and at the same time some small acne lumps could be removed or reduced - although they were not his main concern.' The surgery carried a higher risk of causing hyper-pigmented scarring, resulting in darker areas of skin, because Mr Egonu is black, his lawyers claimed. 'Hyper-pigmented': The businessman, left before the operation and right, afterwards, had wanted to reduce the bulbous tip of his nose and remove acne scars at the same time - although this was not his main concern . Drastically altered: The building surveyor says even his own children ask him about the scar, and that he should have been better warned of the risks . Life-changing mistake: The judge agreed that Mr Egonu would probably not have gone ahead with the operation had he been properly informed of the scarring risk . He had wanted the size of his nose reduced by the procedure, the county court heard, and believed there was no risk of permanent adverse scarring. Hyper-pigmentation is the result of an . overproduction of melanin, a substance which gives skin and hair its . colour, protects against UV light and absorbs heat from the sun. An . overproduction of melanin leads to a mottled, uneven skin tone. It can . be stimulated by excessive sun exposure, hormones, or scarring. Post-inflammatory . hyper-pigmentation is a darkening of skin as a result of skin injury or . acne scarring, caused by an inflammatory response in skin. You cannot stimulate cells the skin's immune system cells without stimulating cells linked to melanin production. If the pigment is found in cells deep in the skin it is very difficult to treat. Source: Dermalogica . Dr Adeniran, however, insisted that he gave Mr Egonu a strengthened warning about the potential downsides of the operation. At their initial consultation, he claimed Mr Egonu told him he had a good knowledge about the options open to him but did not want a complete rhinoplasty as he did not want to 'look like Michael Jackson'. Dr Adeniran’s QC, Richard Wilson, urged the judge to reduce the figure because the scar was only visible at a conversational distance, but Mr Egonu was awarded £26,000. The doctor went on to challenge the county court ruling at London’s Appeal Court. His lawyers argued that he gave his patient a clear warning about the risks of the procedure. But Mr Egonu insisted that, after his wife expressed concerns, the surgeon reassured him that scarring would not happen, and that, if it did, he would have to use him as a case study. Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with Lord Justice McFarlane, said the county court judge found that Mr Egonu gave consistent evidence that he would not have gone ahead with the operation had he been properly informed of the scarring risk.

He was also told to stay at least 500 metres (550 yards) from the couple as part of his bail. Scroll down for videos . Earnest: Sam Bracanov appeared at Auckland District Court today after he was arrested less than an hour before the royals arrived in his country . Sitting outside the courthouse, Bracanov . admitted he would have thrown the manure at Charles and Camilla if he had not been arrested. 'I make it liquid like porridge,' he told reporters. 'I would have done it. I was going to mix it with water, stir it around and make it easy to throw and then throw it at them. 'Royalty smells, so what difference does it make if I hit them?'

The couple are currently . touring Australia and New Zealand as part of the celebrations to mark . Queen Elizabeth's 60 years on the throne. Others have also heckled the royal couple during their six-day visit to New Zealand, and many were angered by prime minister John Key's confirmation that the British Commonwealth country would pay for Camilla's travelling hairdresser. Most New Zealanders are supporters of the monarchy, however. A poll conducted by Television New Zealand before the royal couple arrived last week found that 70 per cent want to keep Queen Elizabeth as head of state. Strong beliefs: Bracanov has been ordered to stay away from the royals and will have to return to court later this month .

An artist intends to sue the organisers of the London Olympics because he believes director Danny Boyle used his design for the opening ceremony set. Lee Sendall, from Hull, entered drawings of a spiral mound in the middle of the countryside into an arts competition held by Olympic chiefs. After not winning, he thought no more of it until he saw the Slumdog Millionaire director's memorable opening ceremony in July this year. Familiar look? Lee Sendall's Olympics design for features a small lake, . low-lying clouds and giant spiral-shaped mound as the centrepiece, with a . man holding a torch on top . 'Isles of Wonder': Director Danny Boyle's set for the spectacular £27million opening ceremony has a very similar design . Mr Sendall noticed that the spiral-shaped, verdant hill that formed the centrepiece of the spectacular event looked remarkably similar to the one he had entered into the 2009 competition. The 42-year-old has now taken legal advice with a view to suing the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Locog) for breach of copyright. Mr Sendall and his friend Dominic Heffer entered their ‘Large Spiral Mound’ design as part of an Arts Council competition held in conjunction with London 2012. The idea was for artists to come up with a project, such as a sculpture, that was associated with English regions. Mr Sendall decided to build a grassy, spiral mound in East Yorkshire and created a series of postcards depicting the concept. His design also included a small lake, low-lying clouds and a man running up the mound with the Olympic torch - all of which also featured in Boyle's ceremony. Competition: Mr Sendall, left, says he is not angry but would like recognition from Boyle, right, and is hoping to sue the organising committee - if he can afford it . The competition’s aim was not to find ideas for the opening ceremony, but Mr Sendall claims the organisers based the final product on his design. Mr Sendall said: 'I entered the competition in the Yorkshire heat and did a brief proposal about building a spiral mound in East Yorkshire. 'I was lucky enough to be short-listed but wasn’t selected as the eventual winner. 'I moved on and put the idea on the shelf. There was still a possibility of doing it in the future. 'About two weeks before the Olympics, I saw an article in a newspaper which set out the design for the opening ceremony and there was a picture of a model by Danny Boyle. 'I was gobsmacked. The model had so many similarities to so much of our work. 'Our version was the mounds through the ages and the 2012 model looked like what ended up in the opening ceremony. 'I didn’t invent spiral mounds. The notion isn’t original but there were just too many similarities for it to be a coincidence, given that we had entered an Olympic competition.' Iconic images: The 42-year-old artist was convinced that Boyle must have seen his competition entry from 2009 after watching the London 2012 opening ceremony, pictured . Another view: Locog insist that the opening ceremony design was based on the Glastonbury Tor in Somerset, pictured . The ‘Isles of Wonder’ opening ceremony was seen by 26.9million people across the country. It had the largest average audience for any broadcast since 1996 and was one of the top 20 most-watched UK television broadcasts of all time. Mr Kendall has consulted lawyers about taking legal action but says the cost involved could force him to abandon his plans. He said: 'I’m not angry, it’s more like a feeling of bemusement. Did I give away a concept that was used as the centrepiece of a £27million event? 'People were getting in touch with me on the night asking if Danny Boyle had got our permission to use our idea. 'If they were in any way inspired by our idea then Dominic and I should have had some form of recognition. 'Somebody like Danny Boyle saying these artists from Hull came up with this idea, that would obviously be very nice.' A London 2012 spokeswoman denied the organisers had used Mr Sendall’s idea and said their set had been inspired by Glastonbury Tor. He said: 'Danny Boyle was not involved in the Taking the Lead programme, which was funded by the Arts Council, and would not have seen any of the submissions. 'Danny Boyle’s vision for the opening set for the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony was inspired by the very well known Glastonbury Tor landmark and British history.'","Lee Sendall, 42, created several postcards for a competition held by London 2012 and the Arts Council in 2009 .

It could mean the sight of Posh gliding through Sydney in her trademark sunglasses with well-travelled children Brooklyn, Cruz, Romeo and Harper Seven in tow. Popular trip for Brits: David and Victoria Beckham could be about to make a move to the other side of the world . Beckham signed a two-year deal with his current side in January, tying him to the U.S., but he could head across the world during the gap between seasons in the . Major Soccer League. The . former England captain's family would therefore not have to make another . permanent move. Beckham moved to the U.S. from Spain's Real Madrid as part of a £20million deal in 2007. He has previously joined AC Milan on loan between MLS seasons, so this could be another chance for . Victoria to tour the designer stores of the world's most . glamorous cities. Earlier this month, however, there were . rumours that Victoria wanted to move to New York to pursue her . flourishing fashion career. An FFA spokesperson said: 'The approach from David Beckham's . people is another sign of how much the Hyundai A-League has grown in . stature on a global basis. Family holiday: Beckham could move the whole brood - Victoria, Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper - to the other side of the world . 'Beckham is a superstar on the world . stage and he would be another massive signing for the Hyundai A-League . after the arrivals of Alessandro Del Piero, Emile Heskey and Shinji Ono. 'But this approach remains at a very preliminary stage.' Reports in Australia suggest that any move for Beckham would likely see him agree a 10-match stay. A spokesman for Beckham, however, refuted the claim, saying: 'David is completely focused on the . MLS play offs and winning another Championship with the Galaxy. 'There's always enormous interest from clubs across world in signing David. He has absolutely no plans to play in Australia.' Beckham could play his last Galaxy . game of the season this weekend when his side meet the Seattle Sounders . in the second leg of their Western Conference Championship play-off. Perth Glory have already stated an interest in Beckham and Lyall Gormal, executive chairman of the Western Sydney Wanderers, said the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star would have obvious commercial appeal. Eye on the ball: Beckham could be set to make a short-term move to Australia . He told Sky Sports News: 'We haven't had formal or informal contact over this, but clearly we are aware of the iconic vale of David Beckham. 'Beckham is outstanding. We've seen him here before on a couple of occasions. There was an 80,000 sell-out at the Olympic Stadium and he was here with the Galaxy the year before last for a game against the Newcastle Jets. 'He would be a fantastic commodity to bring to Australia.' On the contradictory statements from the FFA and the Beckham camp, Mr Gormal added: 'It is puzzling isn't it? 'My understanding is there have been . informal approaches to other clubs. One or two have already come out and . talked about their interest. Clearly there has been some informal . discussions.' Head boy: A spokesperson for Beckham has dismissed the story . Perth Glory chief . executive Paul Kelly said: 'We are always happy to speak to . players of the calibre of David Beckham, who would be great for the . Hyundai A-League. 'At the end of the day it's the . coach, Ian Ferguson, who makes these decisions and we as a club, have a . process that we follow when recruiting players. 'But we would be mad not to seriously consider David Beckham.' Yet Melbourne Victory coach Ange Postecoglou has ruled out making an approach for the football superstar.

Firefighters have been forced to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds rescuing severely obese people - including those stuck in the bath – in the past five years. UK fire and rescue services have responded to more than 2,700 calls, with a single incident costing as much as £11,000. As well as rescuing people wedged in baths, firefighters have been called to pick up obese people who have fallen out of bed, help undertakers move bodies too heavy to lift and assist those needing medical treatment that are who large to leave their homes. Firefighters have been called to pick up obese people who have fallen out of bed and help undertakers move bodies too heavy to lift . A Freedom of Information request, to which 53 out of 58 UK fire and rescue services responded, revealed that South Wales Fire and Rescue attended the most calls – a total of 189 since 2007. London and Essex were placed second and third, with 170 and 159 respectively. Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service had incurred the highest costs, spending £313,000 on assisting obese people with one single three-and-a-half hour rescue costing £11,000. The most expensive single incident in England was a £5,000 rescue carried out by Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service. London, South Yorkshire and West Midlands services all incurred costs of more than £50,000 over five years. It is likely that the total number of calls is even higher than 2,700, as some services have not kept records of this type of incident. At the request of firefighters, a new category of rescuing a ‘bariatric’ (severely obese) person was added to the Incident Reporting System used by services in England in April this year. Three firefighters at County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service have suffered muscle strain while trying to move an obese person, area manager Alan Kernohan told BBC 5 Live Investigates, which submitted the FOI request. It is one of several services which has changed its policy to respond instantly only when people need urgent medical attention. It will carry out a risk assessment before acting in non-emergency cases. Other services are already charging the obese person or, more usually, local ambulance services for their help.

He had not left home in two years and the front wall of his flat had to be knocked down and a forklift truck used to get him out. He told the programme that he was ‘embarrassed’ about what had happened. He said: ‘I thought “why are they doing it for me?” My esteem, the way I thought about myself, was non-existent. ‘My eating disorder was way out of control, my depression was severe, and I just didn’t want to get to grips with my life or sort myself out in those days. ‘In this country we have a policy where we treat people whatever problems they’ve got. It took a situation like that for me to realise how bad I got myself.’ Mr Mason has since lost 40 stone. Peter Dartford, speaking on behalf of the Chief Fire Officers Association, told the Today programme that the figures should make people think about their lifestyles. He said: ‘Fire and rescue service are here to help and people find themselves in need of help for a number of reasons. They may be medical conditions, they may indeed be lifestyle choices but we don’t judge we just get on and help people. ‘While we do respond to people in need we are actively seeking to reduce demand for this kind of service by encouraging people to act differently. ‘Prevention is not only better than cure it is very much cheaper than cure.

Some people would pay thousands to eat lunch with a spectacular view, but this crafty leopard takes her meals to another level. These incredible pictures show the big cat having a snack while up a tree in south-western Kenya and were taken by New York-based photographer Cindy Corcoran. Ms Corcoran had to patiently wait nearly two hours before the female leopard revealed herself and led her safari group to the secret lunch spot. Feat: With incredible agility and strength, this leopard dragged its kill up a tree to eat . Tasty: The animal made the most of its peaceful vantage point in the tree to have a relaxed bite to eat . Wild and free: The savannah in south-west Kenya is famous for its diverse population . Ms Corcoran said: 'We were driving around the Maasai Mara early one morning when we saw about 25 vehicles around some thick scrub. 'We knew it had to be something exciting so we drove over to find out that there was a leopard in the area. 'After about 90 minutes, one by one each vehicle left because this leopard was nowhere in sight anymore. 'As they were each pulling away my guide spotted this female leopard well hidden in this thick brush. 'It finally got down to about three vehicles, when she finally decided to come out in the open. 'She proceeded to walk out into the wide open savannah plains, taking her time, and obviously knew where she wanted to go. Protective: The leopard had left its prey high up the tree earlier in the day to keep it safe . Hungry mouths: Experts believe the leopard was planning to take the gazelle home to share with the family . Unforgettable: Ms Corcoran said the experience in the Maasai Mara would stay with her for life . Guarded: The female leopard made those following her wait for two hours before leading them to her meal . 'We followed close behind her and she seemed relaxed and disinterested in us driving along with her.' Ms Corcoran followed the predator for a while before seeing the leopard stop suddenly and look around a lone tree before climbing up at impressive speed. She said: 'We were so focused on looking at her that we did not notice that there was a Thomson's gazelle body hanging near the top of this tree. 'This was a kill that she must have put up there the night before. She sat with it a few minutes, then came back down the tree.

Risks: Common allergy medicines have been found to cause memory and concentration problems in older people, researchers say. Picture posed by model . Allergy pills taken by thousands of Britons could be causing memory problems, researchers claim. Common treatments including Benadryl for hayfever have been found to increase forgetfulness and concentration difficulties in pensioners. Canadian scientists have also found a link with popular sleeping pills and antidepressants. They are now urging doctors to consider whether their patients should really be taking these medications in light of the possible side-effects. Although the researchers did not look at the risk of dementia, there is some evidence having mild memory problems makes you far more susceptible to the devastating illness. Academics from Montreal University in Canada looked at 68 studies which had examined the potential health risks of certain medications. They found that treatments for allergies, insomnia, depression and for overactive bladders were all linked to memory and concentration problems. These drugs include Benadryl, for hayfever, benzodiazepines such as the sleeping pills diazepam and temazepam and the antidepressant  amitriptyline. Lead researcher Dr Cara Tannenbaum warned that the potential effects of such drugs on memory problems, or cognitive decline, is ‘undervalued.’ She said: ‘Patients need this information so that they are more comfortable talking to their doctors and pharmacists about safer pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment options. ‘Each individual has a right to make an informed choice based on preference and a thorough understanding of the effects the medications may have on their memory and function.’ The study, published in the journal Drugs and Aging, concluded: ‘Patients are increasingly concerned with perceived memory and attention deficits that may signal early dementia. ‘The impact of medications on cognitive function and their ability to affect the results of neuropsychological test scores during the clinical assessment of memory complaints is undervalued. Recall: Having mild memory problems can make elderly people more susceptible to dementia, evidence suggests . ‘There is a consistent body of evidence suggesting that drug-induced mild cognitive impairment can occur with episodic use of medications for insomnia, anxiety or allergy symptoms.’ Experts think the drugs interfere with chemicals in the brain called neurotransmitters, which are responsible for passing on messages. This may result in forgetfulness, concentration problems and there is some evidence it leads to dementia. Earlier this year Harvard researchers found that benzodiazepines increased the risk of developing the devastating illness by up to 50 per cent. Most antihistamine tablets are sold over the counter and there are no figures for the numbers of patients currently using them. But as many as 15 million Britons suffer from some form of allergy in their lives, including hayfever, although not all will seek treatment. Figures also show that around 1.5 million are on sleeping pills and 6 million on antidepressants.","Canadian scientists say allergy pills can hit memory of older people .

Tracey Taylor, 41, offered the huge amount of cash for information about the burglar who stole an entire safe from her home while her family were at a funeral. She described her family as 'devastated' by the loss of jewellery and a substantial amount of money, but now she has been charged, along with two men, with kidnapping.

They allegedly bundled the man into a car which was later intercepted by police. Maidstone Magistrates’ Court heard the man was allegedly kidnapped on the Promenade in Leysdown, Kent. Taylor, also from Strood, appealed for information after burglars broke into her home and prised a safe off the wall in the basement and made off with it on July 31. At the time, the personal trainer said there was a substantial amount of money in the safe along with some jewellery. She said she knew immediately something was wrong as she could see a kitchen window was open.

Members of the England football team who struggled to unwind after their game against Poland was delayed by 20 hours were given sleeping tablets, it has emerged. The decision is likely to raise questions after the team managed only a 1-1 draw - losing out on two vital World Cup points - in a lacklustre performance when the game finally went ahead at Warsaw's National Stadium last night. The England players, some of whom routinely take caffeine stimulant tablets before matches, had been all set to take on the Polish team on Tuesday night, but the game was postponed at the last minute because of a waterlogged pitch. Blunder: Poland's Kamil Glik beats Joe Hart to the ball to score the equaliser in Warsaw . Many players struggled to unwind after being poised to take to the pitch, and those worst-affected were given sleeping tablets. When the match went ahead last night Wayne Rooney scored to give his team a first-half lead, but Poland's Kamil Glik equalised 20 minutes from time to bring the score level. The disappointing result raised questions over the impact taking sleeping pills can have on a player's performance. But goalkeeper Joe Hart was quick to take the blame for the scoreline, while defender Rio Ferdinand took to Twitter to rubbish suggestions sleeping tablets had anything to do with Wednesday's result, posting 'What's all the fuss with caffeine/sleeping tablets?? Players have used them for yrs before + after games without any fuss...' Hart shouldered responsibility for Poland’s goal after coming out to punch a corner, only to be beaten to the ball by centre half Glik. ‘I came out and didn’t get there,’ said Hart. ‘It’s my fault and that’s cost us the three points.' Poland mastered the sodden pitch better than the English players, who looked to have suffered more from the disruption of the game being put back because of a waterlogged pitch. Thousands of football fans who had travelled to eastern Europe for the game were left infuriated after officials ignored weather forecasts and chose not to close the £400million stadium's retractable roof. Heavy rain had been falling in the Polish capital for most of the day, but the roof stayed open and - after 45 minutes of deliberation - the game was called off. Main man: Glik celebrates after heading home the equaliser for Poland against England . The key World Cup qualifying tie eventually went ahead last night, but players and fans will have been disappointed with the result. Manager Hodgson said: ‘I had the impression . earlier in the week that the players were looking sharp and lively. I . didn’t have that impression today. I don’t know if that’s due to the . extra night, the sodden pitch or that we didn’t play well on the day. ‘There are days when you don’t hit the heights. You just have to make certain you don’t go away ruing that fact. A point in Warsaw is not to be looked down upon.’ Hodgson took his team for a walk and a stretch on Wednesday morning and no-one tried to use the delay as an excuse. Captain Steven Gerrard questioned why the roof of the stadium in Poland wasn't closed due to the weather ahead of the scheduled match on Tuesday, but added that the players were 'at the top level' and couldn't use the delay as an excuse. 'When you’re fired up, pumped up and you’ve had your massages and you’re ready to go and then don’t play, that’s not ideal,' he said. 'But we’re professionals. We’re playing at the top level and we had to get ourselves up for this but I didn’t think we were totally at the races. ‘The pitch was slippy, wet and cutting . up. I think it was laid a week-and-a-half ago. So it wasn’t ideal. Both . teams tried to make the most of it and they did it better. Opening salvo: Wayne Rooney got his shoulder to the ball to put England in front in Warsaw . ‘The surprise was why they didn’t shut the roof the night before when it was raining. But that’s life. We get on with it. I won’t use the delay and conditions as an excuse. The reason we didn’t win was because we didn’t pass it when we went in front.’ The draw means England will be overtaken as group leaders if Montenegro beat San Marino next month and manager Hodgson is looking for a big improvement when his side travel to San Marino and Montenegro in March. He said: ‘We didn’t play well. We’ve got to be satisfied we came away with a point. We were fortunate to be 1-0 up at half-time because we hadn’t played well. ‘The extra day and stay over, the sogginess of the pitch didn’t work in our favour. But we leave here with a point, on an unbeaten run, and hopefully we’ll continue to progress and get the points  we need.’","The England football team's game against Poland ended in a 1-1 draw .

Apology: Staff at payday loans firm Wonga branded shadow home affairs minister Stella Creasy (pictured) 'mental' in an anonymous Twitter attack . Staff at controversial payday loans firm Wonga branded an MP campaigning against the company ‘mental’ in an anonymous Twitter attack. Stella Creasy, a shadow home affairs minister, was also labelled ‘nuts’, ‘a raving self-publicist’ and a ‘self-serving egomaniac’ in posts from a now closed Twitter account traced back to the firm’s offices. The online slurs were made after she accused Wonga of ‘legal loan sharking’ for offering short-term loans of up to £1,000 with a typical annual rate of interest of 4,214 per cent. Company computers were also allegedly used to post anonymous comments on blogs critical of its practices and to delete criticism from its Wikipedia page. Wonga accepted that a staff member had posted the offensive Tweets but stressed the comments were not authorised by them and appeared to have come from an ‘over-zealous’ employee. The Twitter account was operated in the name of @DanielSargant1, but it was closed shortly after a newspaper journalist questioned Wonga about its provenance. No one of that name is thought to work at the company, but an online comment on a blog using the same name was said to be made from an IP address – a unique set of numbers similar to a telephone number that computers use to communicate with one another – based at Wonga’s London offices. We're sorry: Wonga apologised to Dr Creasy for the tweets which accused her of being a 'raving self-publicist' The same IP address was used to edit the firm’s Wikipedia profile, it was reported. 'In this job, sometimes when people are out to get you, they really are out to get you. Wonga admits trolling me' Stella Creasy, Labour MP . Dr . Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, said: ‘Wonga have been less than . positive about the arguments I’ve made about cost-capping [of . short-term loans] and have been the most virulent and aggressive about . defending the industry as a whole.’ Dr Creasy has been an outspoken critic of payday loan companies since being elected in 2010. She has helped organise rallies, set up a website and lead pickets outside money lending shops as part of the protest. Changes: David Cameron told MPs yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading would have new powers to suspend the credit licences of rogue payday loan firms to protect customers . After receiving an apology from the . company, she tweeted: ‘In this job, sometimes when people are out to get . you, they really are out to get you. Wonga admits trolling me.’ However, Wonga maintains ‘an unauthorised junior employee’ is responsible for the attacks. The total number of loans Wonga  agreed quadrupled to almost 2.5million in 2011 after it started accepting applications via a mobile phone app, pushing profits up from £12.4million to £45.8million. The company insists it offers a valuable service by helping people access cash quickly until they are paid. But critics have accused it of cashing in on the desperation caused by the soaring cost of living and pay freezes. A Wonga spokesman said if they found the employee who posted the offensive comments they would face ‘serious disciplinary action.’ She added: ‘This is an issue that Wonga takes extremely seriously, as we are committed to openness and transparency. We are now carrying out a full investigation.’ She said Wonga regularly reviews its Wikipedia entry, but added: ‘We would not attempt to remove accurate material, even if negative. ‘To be clear, we do not condone any form of misleading or aggressive behaviour, on or offline.’ It came as David Cameron told MPs yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading would have new powers to suspend the credit licences of rogue payday loan firms to protect customers.","Labour MP Stella Creasy labelled 'nuts' and 'raving self-publicist' on Twitter .

A luxury cruise operator is being sued for a total of £500,000 by 25 passengers who say they had their dream holidays ruined after contracting stomach bugs. The passengers, who all sailed on the Independence of the Seas cruise liner at some stage between December 2010 and June 2011, claim they were laid low by gastroenteritis, due to alleged lapses of hygiene aboard ship. They are now suing Royal Caribbean & Celebrity Cruises, of Weybridge, Surrey, with one couple alone claiming their bathroom cabinet was infested with sewer flies, and that they saw one waiter sneeze into a napkin before placing it on a table, and another wipe his nose on his sleeve. Sea of green: 25 passengers who sailed on Royal Caribbean International's Independence of the Seas cruise ship claim they suffered gastroenteritis due to alleged lapses of hygiene . The group say there had been ‘multiple cases of gastroenteritis on previous cruises’ on the vessel, which they dubbed a ‘sick ship’, and that they ought to have been warned and offered an alternative or a refund. Charles Crow, the barrister representing the group, states in documents lodged in the High Court that the passengers had been promised that Royal Caribbean were ‘committed to excellence’ and had been told they could ‘look forward to an experience like no other’. ‘The passengers would have presumed and Royal Caribbean must have intended this to mean a unique experience for good reasons,’ says Mr Crow, who claims the firm ‘caused or allowed multiple guests to suffer symptoms of gastroenteritis’. ‘There were often ambulances waiting for customers at the ports visited,’ he states. Shore leave: One of the passengers believed to have suffered food poisoning while aboard is lifted on to an ambulance after the ship arrived at port . Frequent sight: One passenger told how 'there were often ambulances waiting for customers at the ports visited' Mr Crow alleged Royal Caribbean’s . staff had ‘failed properly to clean the ship’ before or during the . cruises, and ‘provided unhygienic food that was capable of causing – and . did cause – the claimants to suffer illness’. Yesterday holidaymakers involved in . the class action told the Daily Mail they would never set foot upon such . a large liner again after their ‘horrendous’ experiences on the 15-deck . vessel, which caters for up to 4,370 passengers. Peter Morley, a retired scientist from Rugby, Warwickshire, booked a £1,500, 11-night cruise to the Canaries with wife Glenys, a retired accountant. Problems began when they arrived at . Southampton to be told there was a delay because the ship was undergoing . a ‘deep clean’ because of a sickness outbreak on the previous voyage. Just . 24 hours into the voyage, Mrs Morley, 63, became ‘savagely’ ill for . around 36 hours, but did not fully recover until two weeks after their . return. Peter Morley, 66, (left) whose wife Glenys was one of many taken ill,  and David Sacks (right) who was one of those struck down with food poisoning on the ship . Mr Morley, 66, said he believes the sheer size of such ships makes controlling outbreaks ‘near impossible’, adding: ‘Once an infection occurs, it spreads like wildfire. Every day at breakfast and lunch there is a scrum to get to the buffet and you end up with all these people within touching distance of open food, shuffling past and coughing and spluttering. It is little wonder outbreaks like this occur.’ A spokesman for Royal Caribbean said: ‘Of the 25 guests, not all experienced illness. Those affected by the short-lived illness responded well to over-the-counter medication which was administered on-board the ship. ‘Regarding the instances referred to, our crew conducted extensive cleaning on-board the ship and guests were kept up to date on these additional measures prior to embarkation and throughout their cruise. ‘Our hygiene procedures on-board are comprehensive and always strictly adhered to.’","The passengers all sailed on the Independence of the Seas cruise liner .

This is the dramatic moment armed police surrounded the home of an embittered man who planted a hoax bomb on his landing to scare neighbours in his genteel Lancashire town. Jann Nirmal, 39, who believed he was being 'intimidated' by fellow residents, got drunk and built a cylindrical device featuring hazard stickers, a red light and wires from a sex toy. He then left it at the top of his stairs, leaving a trail of post-it notes along the bannister rail - one of which read: 'Just one more step' - before taking refuge in his bedroom. Nine-hour siege: Armed police officers, equipped with blast shields and sub machine guns, outside the home of Jann Nirmal in Leyland, Lancashire. Nirmal planted a hoax bomb on his landing to scare neighbours . Arrest: Nirmal is led away by police officers at the end of the stand-off, on March 23 this year. Officers broke down his front door and found Nirmal hiding in a bedroom, his fake bomb in pieces . Hoax: Nirmal said he did not intend for his hoax device to cause public panic and the evacuation of 108 houses. He was sentenced to 14 months in prison . The alarm was raised when Nirmal sent a sinister text message to a police constable, who spotted the 'bomb' when he peered through the letter box. He saw the trail of notes from the bottom of the stairs and followed them with his eyes to the device at the top. Police armed with sub-machine guns sealed off the area, in Leyland, Lancashire, during a nine-hour siege, with 108 homes evacuated. Trained negotiators and army bomb squad officers were sent in, while British Red Cross volunteers were used to look after up to 50 locals at a nearby leisure club. Jobless Nirmal eventually gave himself up, telling police it was his intention 'only to frighten the neighbours' and not to alarm the wider public. He was sentenced to 14 months in prison today at Preston Crown Court after admitting placing a hoax bomb. Judge Christopher Cornwall told him: 'You placed that device with the intention of inducing someone else to think the object would explore or ignite and likely cause damage. 'The constable had the unnerving experience to look through the letterbox to find this extraordinary object on the top of the stairs with a red light and wires coming out of it. 'A 100 metre cordon was thrown round your house, which meant that everyone living within it had to evacuate their homes regardless of their state of health and told to leave their pets behind. 'They were kept out of their homes for eight or nine hours. 'It caused immense disruption to the lives of a very large number of people and the whole dreadful incident was spun out for the whole of the day. 'The fact is that those members of the emergency services who attended were then not available had there been a genuine emergency elsewhere. 'The enormity of what you did was a deliberate and calculated act. You said you felt intimidated by your neighbours - even though on investigation they felt contrary. 'It is just wholly unacceptable that you respond by drinking alcohol and erecting this hoax device. 'I regard this as a grave crime, in reality, committed against the whole community. 'All those people who had their lives turned upside down for the whole of that day - I stress it was avoidable.' Chaos: Dozens of armed police were involved in a nine-hour siege after Nirmal alerted police with a sinister text message. Army bomb squad and trained negotiators were also called in . Earlier in the trial, David Traynor, prosecuting, said the incident occurred on March 23, the morning after Nirmal had threatened two of his neighbours. He said 'watch what happens to you lot' before laughing and walking into his house. Police were alerted after a text message sent at 8.15am which read: 'I've had enough, the emotion.' They were able to trace it back to Nirmal. Mr Traynor said: 'Officers banged on the door but there was no answer, so they looked through the letter box. 'The officers could see a 2ft tall, deep purple cylinder emblazoned with an orange hazard sticker on the top of the stairs. Wires connected it to a device which had a red light and it looked like explosives. 14 month sentence: Nirmal was given a jail term at Preston Crown Court, with the judge telling him he had committed a 'grave crime' against the 'whole community' 'Post-it notes were stuck to the stairs, one of which read: 'Just one more step.' The notes were inviting someone to go upstairs - officers felt is was a trap being prepared. 'The defendant was aware that the bomb unit and armed police were in attendance but he would not surrender and he seemed to have a weapon under his bed. At 5pm the police decided entry should be forced.' Once inside, police found parts of the dismantled bomb around the house and arrested Nirmal in his bedroom. In mitigation, his counsel Andrew Gilmore told the hearing: 'It was his intention to frighten the neighbours, not to alarm the wider public. He's desperately sorry for what he's done. He bitterly regrets his actions on that day.' Genteel: Mendip Road (pictured) and adjacent Hunters Road were sealed off by police during the scare and residents evacuated . After the case, Det Insp John Entwistle from Lancashire Police said: 'I hope the jail sentence serves as a warning to others who think it is acceptable to concoct such terrifying hoaxes. 'All three emergency services had to respond to this incident which resulted in hours of wasted time and of course wasted money from the public purse. 'It was also a frightening experience for local residents who had to evacuate their homes and be moved to a rest centre whilst we dealt with the incident. 'Nirmal will not be able to reflect on what he has done whilst serving time in prison and hopefully he will realise the impact his actions have had on people.'","Jann Nirmal, 39, wanted to scare neighbours in the Lancashire town of Leyland .

A Massachusetts utility worker mistakenly punctured a high-pressure pipeline on Friday causing a natural gas explosion that destroyed a building housing a strip club. The explosion injured 18 people and damaged 42 buildings in an entertainment district in Springfield, Massachusetts, one of New England's largest cities. No one was killed in the explosion. Building down: Inspectors stand in debris, Saturday, Nov. 24, 2012, at the site of a gas explosion that leveled a strip club in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Friday evening . Investigators were trying Saturday to figure out what caused the blast . that could be heard for miles and left a large hole in the ground where the . multistory building housing the Scores Gentleman's Club once stood while scattering debris over several blocks. State Fire Marshal Stephen Coan said on Sunday that the Friday night blast was caused by ‘human error.’ He didn't name the Columbia Gas Co. worker who pierced the pipe while responding to reports of a gas leak. The worker damaged the underground pipe while using a metal probe to locate the source of the leak, Coan said. A flood of gas then built up in a building that housed a strip club, and some kind of spark touched off the blast, officials said. Coan said the employee was following older markings on a sidewalk that indicated the location of the gas line. More damage: An apartment building near the area where the gas explosion occurred is seen with shattered windows, among other damage . He appeared to be an appropriate distance from the line, but the markings were incorrect and the worker accidentally punctured the pipe. A message left for a Columbia Gas spokeswoman wasn't immediately returned. Columbia Gas, a subsidiary of public company NiSource Inc., announced earlier Sunday that it planned to open a claims center for residents and businesses affected by the explosion at City Hall on Monday. Preliminary reports showed the blast damaged 42 buildings housing 115 residential units. Three buildings were immediately condemned, and 24 others require additional inspections by structural engineers to determine whether they are safe. The building that housed the Scores Gentleman's Club was completely destroyed. After the pipe was ruptured, authorities evacuated several buildings. Most of the people injured were part of a group of gas workers, firefighters and police officers who ducked for cover behind a utility truck just before the blast. The truck was demolished. Some officials said it was a miracle no one was killed. Springfield Fire Commissioner Joseph Conant praised the actions of city firefighters. ‘The firefighters did an excellent job evacuating the area which certainly prevented additional civilian injuries and saved many lives,’ Conant said. Columbia Gas officials have been cooperating with investigators and have determined that there are no more gas leaks in the neighborhood, Mayor Domenic Sarno said. Coan said the investigation is being turning over to the state Department of Public Utilities. It's not clear whether investigators will ever be able to determine what caused the spark that ignited the explosion. Springfield, which is 90 miles west of Boston and has about 150,000 residents, is the largest city in western Massachusetts. It's known as the home of the Basketball Hall of Fame, which is not near the blast site. The city has been rebuilding from damage caused by a tornado in June 2011.","An unnamed utility worker was looking for a gas leak when he accidentally punctured a high-pressure pipeline in Springfield, Massachusetts .

The Forestry Commission has declared a national emergency after it found a disease which has devastated ash trees in Europe has spread to the British countryside. Ash dieback has been found in the wider environment at sites in East Anglia, and there are fears it could wreak the same kind of damage as Dutch elm disease in the Seventies. Responding to the outbreak, the government today said it will bring in a ban on ash imports and tight restrictions on ash movements within Britain on Monday. Under threat: An ash tree in Gwent. The Forestry Commission today warned that a virulent disease affecting the trees has spread to the UK - and there are fears it could cause as much damage as Dutch elm disease . Environment Secretary Owen Paterson . told MPs of the plan after Simon Hart, Tory MP for Carmarthen West and . South Pembrokeshire, asked in Commons Defra questions what steps the . department was taking to deal with the disease. The Chalara fraxinea fungus, which . causes leaf loss and crown dieback and can lead to tree death, wiped out . 90 per cent of ash trees in Denmark in seven years. It had previously been identified in . nurseries and recently planted sites including a car park, a college . campus and a new woodland. The Forestry Commission today announced that the fungus is being treated as a quarantine pest under national emergency measures and urged members of the public to report any suspected cases. Ash dieback is a serious disease of ash trees caused by a fungus called Chalara fraxinea (C. fraxinea). The disease causes leaf loss and crown dieback in affected trees, as pictured right, and it can lead to tree death. European trees now believed to have been infected with this newly identified pathogen were first reported dying in large numbers in Poland in 1992 and it spread rapidly to other European countries. However, it was 2006 before the fungus’s asexual stage, C. fraxinea, was first described by scientists, and 2010 before its sexual stage, Hymenoscyphus pseudo-albidus, was described. In February 2012 it was found in a consignment of infected trees sent from a nursery in the Netherlands to a nursery in Buckinghamshire. Since then it has been found in a number of locations and situations in England and Scotland, including a car park in Leicester; a Forestry Commission Scotland woodland at Knockmountain, near Kilmacolm, west of Glasgow; a college campus in South Yorkshire; and a property in County Durham. All these sites had received stocks of young ash plants from nurseries within the past five ears. However, now that infected older trees have been found in East Anglia with no apparent connection with nursery stock, the Forestry Commission are also investigating the possibility that it might have entered Britain by natural means. Mr Paterson told the Commons: 'I’ve . very grateful to [Mr Hart] for raising this because there have been . reports today on the radio of the horrific danger to our 80 million ash . trees. 'We have already launched a . consultation on the ground looking in real detail to see whether this . disease has taken root in this country. 'That consultation will report to me . tomorrow and I will discuss it over the weekend with the head of the . Forestry Commission GB and I think on the evidence we are seeing, I . intend to bring in a ban on imports and tight restrictions of ash . movements within GB on Monday.' Labour’s MP Dame Joan Ruddock . criticised the timing of the coalition’s response to the issue, arguing . Mr Paterson would 'not be forgiven for any delay'. She said: 'May I tell the Secretary of . State that he should have banned the import of ash seedlings the minute . the disease was actually found in nurseries in this country. He will . not be forgiven for any delay by the people of this country who so value . the ash trees. 'Will he ensure that the Forestry Commission has all the resources it needs to be able to confront this terrible threat?' Mr Paterson replied: 'I think she is . being pretty unfair. The minute we heard about this we launched a . consultation, that will report tomorrow, so on the basis of evidence, . and all her colleagues are shouting at me about evidence and science . based, I will look at the evidence from tomorrow evening and if it’s a . sensible decision I will ban the import and I will make restrictions on . Monday.' The Woodland Trust today confirmed the . fungus had been found in both mature ancient woodland and woodland . creation areas on its estate at Pound Farm in Suffolk. The Trust is supporting a ban on . importing and moving ash trees in a bid to stop the disease becoming . established in the UK, which the Government is poised to bring in as . early as next week. The Horticultural Trades Association . has also urged members to abide by a voluntary moratorium on importing . ash trees for planting in this country. But there are concerns that if it has been found in the wider countryside, a ban on imports could be of limited value. Infected: A tree in Franfurt, Germany, suffering from ash dieback. The disease, caused by the Chalara fraxinea fungus, causes leaf loss and crown dieback and can lead to tree death . In the UK, ash trees make up around 30 . per cent of the wooded landscape, across woodlands, hedgerows and park. Losing the trees would have serious implications for Britain's ecology, . warned Andrew Sharkey, head of woodland management for the Woodland . Trust. Dutch elm disease caused the deaths of more than 25million elms in the UK alone, almost completely eradicating one of the English countryside's most distinctive trees. Although Dutch elm disease first reached these shores in 1927, a new, more virulent strain appeared in 1967 to which the English elm was particularly susceptible. Caused by a fungus spread by the elm bark beetle, the Dutch elm disease is believed to actually be native to Asia, from where it was accidentally spread by man. Thirty years after the outbreak of the epidemic nearly all of Britain's English elm trees, which often grew 150ft high, are gone. The species still survives in hedgerows, as the roots are not killed and send up root sprouts ('suckers'); but these suckers rarely reach more than 5m before the fungus attacks. The largest remaining concentration of mature elm trees in England is in Brighton and Hove, East Sussex, where 15,000 elms still stood in 2005, several of which were estimated at over 400 years old. Their survival is owing to the isolation of the area and efforts of local authorities remove infected sections of trees as soon as they show symptoms. 'This is yet another example of why . the protection of our native trees, natural resources and eco-systems . needs to be at the top of the agenda and we need a step change in the . level of importance placed on bio-security to tackle the bigger issue,' he said. 'The occurrence of tree diseases in . the UK is becoming far too frequent and once they are established we are . often powerless to act. 'We are potentially facing the ash . equivalent of Dutch elm disease, and unless we take serious measures as a . country we will continue to see problems arising from imported . diseases.' The Trust called for an emergency . summit or taskforce to be set up by the Government to tackle tree . diseases, before another species was lost for good. Dr John Morgan, head of the Forestry . Commission’s plant health service, said: 'We and our colleagues in the . Food and Environment Research Agency, the Scottish Government and the . Northern Ireland Forest Service have stepped up our efforts to tackle . this disease as a priority. 'This includes redeploying Forestry . Commission staff from their usual duties to survey woods and forests in . East Anglia and throughout Great Britain.' He added:'It is still early days and . investigations are continuing, but there is a possibility that the East . Anglia outbreak is an isolated one which has been present for some time. 'This emphasises the importance of preventing spread further afield.' He urged forest managers and tree . professionals to use the information on the Forestry Commission’s . website about the disease, inspect trees again and report any suspected . to be infected. As a precaution, the Forestry Commission is suspending the planting of ash trees in public forests it manages. Infected ash trees have also be identified at Norfolk Wildlife Trust’s Lower Wood reserve, Ashwellthorpe. The trust’s head of nature reserves, . John Milton, said: 'This is possibly the first case of ash dieback . disease in established woodland in Norfolk, although it is likely we . will now see further cases. 'We are working closely with the plant health team from Forestry Commission and monitoring our woodlands closely.' But he warned: 'Tracking the disease . is going to be difficult with the imminent autumnal leaf fall, so the . true extent of the disease in the UK may be difficult to establish until . the spring.' The Forestry Commission today announced that the fungus is being treated as a quarantine pest under national emergency measures and urged members of the public to report any suspected cases. The Commission has produced a pictorial guide to how to spot the disease. Here are some of the signs: .","Ash dieback has been discovered at countryside sites in East Anglia .

Supermarkets have vowed to add more fruit and vegetables to microwaveable ready meals as the Government steps up its battle to get Britain to eat more healthily. Fruit and veg sections will also be expanded and arranged 'more attractively' in a bit to entice people who normally avoid the fresh produce aisle to healthy living. Supermarkets have vowed to add more fruit and vegetables to microwaveable ready meals as the government tries to get Britain to eat more healthily . It comes after it was revealed that fewer than a third of adults and only one in 10 children are eating their recommended five-a-day of fruit and vegetables. A recent poll also showed  23 per cent of Britons think chips count as vegetables, while almost half think the same of roast potatoes. The move will see supermarkets such as Iceland, Aldi and Lidl include more 'child friendly' displays with 'fun cartoon characters'. And Subway will launch a new campaign fronted by athletes Louis Smith and Anthony Ogogo for low-fat and salad options. Eating five portions of fruit and veg a . day helps to lower the risk of serious health problems, such as heart . disease, and some cancers. It is also credited with lowering the risk of obesity. It is part of the Department of Health's Responsibility Deal which works with large businesses to improve Britain's public health. Public Health Minister Anna Soubry said:  'It’s vital that we focus particular . attention on encouraging those who currently consume very little to . boost their intake. 'Research shows that fruit and veg intake ‘tracks’ through childhood and adolescence, so healthy school lunches with at . least two portions of fruit or vegetables are really important to give . children the opportunity to experience fruit and vegetables from an . early age, and to see other children and adults around them enjoying . these foods.' The 16 leading supermarkets, food manufacturers and trade bodies, that have signed up to the pledge include Aldi, Co-operative Food, Iceland, Lidl, Morrisons, M&S, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose, General Mills, Mars, caterers 3663, Brakes, CH & Co Catering, Subway and the British Frozen Food Federation. Aldi will increase the amount of store space dedicated to fresh produce and Lidl will rebrand its entire fruit and vegetable range making it more appealing, particularly for children – with 'fun characters and jokes on kids packs'. Ready meals such as those pictured here are set to include more vegetables under the scheme . Waitrose is training hundreds of staff to become 'fruit and vegetable specialists' offering in store advice to customers. And Iceland has pledged to increase the amount of fruit and vegetables included in packaged meals with low cost frozen options. The move comes as a YouGov survey of more than 2,000 people for Sainsbury's revealed that 23 per cent of Britons think chips count as vegetables, while almost half think the same of roast potatoes. Just over one-third said they did not have time to eat the recommended amount of fresh fruit and vegetable and a fifth said they were too expensive.","Recent poll also showed 23 per cent of Britons think chips count as vegetables, while almost half think the same of roast potatoes .

Michelle, 25, took her straight to the vets where Charlie was kept in overnight before undergoing surgery but her eye was so badly damaged it had to be removed. Now police and RSPCA officers are looking for the culprits responsible and are appealing for information. 'Charlie doesn't usually wander away for too long but she had been been missing for a few days and when she came home, I was just so shocked at what I saw,' said distraught Michelle, from Swinton, near Rotherham. 'Her eye was nearly falling out and there was superglue on her tail.It was obvious what had happened. The vets did what they could but Charlie's eye was in an awful state and they couldn't save it. 'I'm so upset because she must have suffered terribly but I'm also fuming. I want to find out who's done this and stop it happening again. 'I can't believe anyone could be so cruel to a defenceless animal. Charlie is such a friendly cat. Whoever did this is sick, they're not even human.

The 16-year-old's Twitter message - 'There is someone in my hour ecall (sic) 911' - was shared by almost 34,000 people and the #HelpFindKara campaign gathered attention worldwide. A full-scale search was put into operation by New Jersey police, including large amounts of expensive overtime. But as authorities investigated it became obvious that the story didn't add up. Then Kara was found unharmed two days later and safely returned to her parents. Officials have never put a final figure on how much the operation to find Alongi cost them, and the taxpayer. But today Clark Township announced that the police bill incurred by Kara's hoax will not be passed onto her family. 'Kidnap': A huge worldwide campaign went into operation to find Kara Alongi. Police have now decided that her family won't face the bills for her search . Found: Kara Alongi, 16, was picked up by officials on a highway after being caught on CCTV at the NJ Transit Station in Rahway . Clark mayor Sal Bonaccorso told The Star-Ledger that the bill was not 'exorbitant' and he didn't want to burden Kara's parents. 'We're not going to sit there and pass . the costs along,' Bonaccorso said.'Obviously this young lady had some . things going on, however you want to say it. We're just happy she was . returned to her family and we hope she makes some better choices in the . future.' Alongi gained hundreds of followers . after asking people on Twitter to call 911 that first Sunday. However, all evidence pointed toward the teen being an apparent runaway. Surveillance video showed her at the . Rahway train station purchasing a ticket to New York City on Sunday . after the tweet was sent. Then Clark Police Chief Alan Scherb said state troopers spotted 16-year-old Kara Alongi walking along the New Jersey Turnpike near Interchange 1 in Carneys Point around 4.30pm Tuesday October 2. She was taken to a hospital for evaluation and returned home early Wednesday. Disappeared: Police traced a phone call placed from her house to a local cab company around the same time as the Tweet, and the cab driver identified her as the girl he picked up . The high school student posted . a misspelled message to her Twitter page around 6.20pm Sunday night . that gave the impression that she was in a panic, stating: 'There is . someone in my hour ecall 911'. Her Twitter followers did not call the . authorities, but her parents did once they returned to the family home . in Clark, New Jersey, and realized that the girl was missing. But . the teenager was spotted on CCTV holding a backpack and a . large purse while waiting for a train at the NJ Transit station in . Rahway. The 16-year-old's lone tweet that . appeared to be a desperate plea for help went viral with hundreds of . Twitter messages posted hoping for a her safe return. Clark police confirmed Sunday night . that the girl's initial tweet was a hoax and there were no signs of foul . play in Alongi's home. At the time of her disappearance, her family were watching her younger brother's sporting event. Police . brought a canine unit to the home and, according to their press . release, the dogs 'tracked Kara's scent from the back door of the house, . through a neighbor's yard and then to the sidewalk and around the . corner back onto her block where the scent goes cold.' Gone: The taxi driver took her to the nearby Rahway train station which has regular services to Manhattan . After initially believing the Tweet, police became suspicious because there were no signs of foul play or abduction. The . biggest sign, however, that something was amiss came from phone records . that showed someone in the Alongi's home called a local taxi company . and ordered a pick up at their address right around the time that Kara . posted the intruder claim to Twitter. 'The investigation quickly revealed a number of inconsistencies in the teen's statement,' the police statement reveals. The local Patch site . reports that police got in touch with the taxi driver who picked up the . request, and the man identified Kara as the girl he drove to the nearby . Rahway train station. The train station serves the Northeast Corridor line and the North Jersey Coast line, both of which have their northern-most stop in Manhattan. 'Kara might feel that she will be in trouble if she comes home after this scare and causing a panic.

In all 18 people were injured, many of them emergency workers investigating a possible gas leak an hour before the explosion in Springfield, 90 miles west of Boston. Their injuries aren't life-threatening. Scroll down for videos . Blown out: More than 40 buildings were damaged when a gas explosion levelled a gentlemen's club and blew out windows for blocks . Guarding: Officers stand at a perimeter around where a gas explosion leveled a strip club in Springfield and injured 18 people . Mementos: A woman's high-heeled shoe is seen among the rubble where Score's Gentleman's Club use to be . Cordoning off the area on Saturday a preliminary finding by building inspectors reported 42 damaged buildings that house 115 residential units. Three were immediately condemned. Investigators are still trying to figure out what caused the Friday evening blast that could be heard for miles and left a massive hole where Scores Gentlemen's Club once stood in a multi-storey brick building. The explosion blew out windows in a three-block radius, leaving at least three buildings irreparably damaged and causing emergency workers to evacuate a six-story apartment building that was buckling, police said. Pieces of broken glass littered streets and sidewalks. It was unclear how many residents had been evacuated. A shelter was set up at a school. Suspicious report: Workers surveyed the damage the morning after following a report of a strong gas odour an hour before the building exploded . Miracle: Springfield, with about 150,000 residents, is the largest city in western Massachusetts prompting Lt. Gov. Tim Murray to declare it a miracle no one died . Officials had already evacuated part of the entertainment district after responding to a gas leak and odour reported about an hour before the explosion while firefighters, police officers and gas company workers were in the area filled with commercial properties and residences. 'It really is a miracle and it's an example of our public safety officials, each and every day, putting themselves in harm's way, taking what could have been considered a very routine call of an odour of gas, but they took the proper precautions,' State Fire Marshal Stephen Coan said. 'And thanks to God that they did.' Officials also marvelled how the 5.30pm blast occurred when a day care centre next door to Scores was closed. The centre’s building was heavily damaged. Lt. Gov. Tim Murray and Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno were attending a tree-lighting ceremony when the explosion occurred. Sarno said some people mistakenly thought the boom was part of the holiday event. Wrecked: An apartment building, about a block away from the area, is seen with many of its windows blown out blanketing the ground with glass and other dangerous debris . Estimations: Residents and business owners creeped as close to the scene as they could on Saturday hoping to survey the damage while building inspectors worked to estimate which were safe to enter . Close call: A day care centre directly beside the strip club is seen with its windows shattered which remarkably was closed before the explosion erupted . Small businesses: Robert Spano, left, and Alan Hugley shovel broken glass outside of Punta cana Restaurant & Bar, one of many businesses feared by their owners and managers of staying closed for too long . Murray said it was 'a miracle' no one was killed. Omar Fermin, manager of the Punta Cana Restaurant two blocks from the explosion site, found the floor-to-ceiling windows blasted out when he came to check on the property Saturday morning. 'It looks like an earthquake hit,' said Fermin, a native of the Dominican Republic. 'I've never seen anything like it.' He said he was waiting for somebody to come and assess the damage. He worried the restaurant would remain closed for weeks while the owner seeks to replace the massive custom-made windows. On Saturday anxious residents gathered at the site’s perimeter, waiting for permission to visit their buildings. Trapped inside, dogs were heard barking loudly from inside abandoned buildings on Saturday as building inspectors fanned out across the area. One inspector said he wished he could get a ladder and permission to retrieve a dog that was barking in the upper floor of one building sealed off from residents. Leveled: Gas company workers stand where a building once stood, which was leveled by the explosion in downtown Springfield. Victims: An injured firefighter is wheeled from the scene . Coan, the fire marshal, said his office was investigating a cause of the blast and its possible origin. The state's Department of Public Utilities was also investigating. Sheila Doiron, a spokeswoman for Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, said the company will continue to monitor for any potential leaks within several blocks of the blast site. So far, she said, the company hadn't yet found any measurable readings. Those injured were nine firefighters, two police officers, four Columbia Gas workers, two civilians and another city employee. Springfield, with about 150,000 residents, is the largest city in western Massachusetts. It's known as the home of the Basketball Hall of Fame, which is not in the vicinity of the blast. The city has been rebuilding from damage it sustained in a June of 2011 tornado. Exploded: The Scores Gentlemen's Club, pictured here in 2009 when it was called 'Lace', was leveled in the gas blast that occurred around 5pm on Friday . Powerful: Glass and debris litter a street after the explosion . On Friday night, residents milled around the neighbourhood where the explosion occurred, stunned by the destruction and confused by the cordoned-off area, which grew as crews continued to search for gas leaks. The mayor warned against looting, saying police would be out in force. Wayne Davis, who lives about a block away from the destroyed building, said he felt his apartment shake. 'I was lying down in bed, and I started feeling the building shaking and creaking,' he said. The Navy veteran said the boom from the explosion was louder than anything he'd ever heard, including the sound of a jet landing on an aircraft carrier. The blast was so loud it was heard in several neighbouring communities. Video from WWLP-TV showed the moment of the explosion, with smoke billowing into the air above the neighbourhood.","18 people were injured after the explosion levelled Scores Gentlemen's Club in Springfield .

Thousands of elderly people are suffering poor and unsafe care in hospitals and care homes, a watchdog said last night. Callous staff routinely treat pensioners with little respect and do not even help them to eat their meals when they are clearly malnourished. Fifteen per cent of hospitals and 20 per cent of nursing homes failed to meet national standards on ensuring residents had enough food and drink, and the help they needed to consume it, a report found. Shameful: Callous care home staff routinely treat pensioners with little respect and do not even help them to eat their meals when they are malnourished, a report found . Ten per cent of NHS hospitals and 15 per cent of nursing homes failed to meet standards on treating patients with dignity and respect. Only 2 per cent of private hospitals had the same failings. The damning study by the Care Quality Commission watchdog revealed that too many doctors, nurses and care home staff see patients not as people but as tasks to be completed. Care staff ‘fail to see past the illness’ or ‘treat each person as someone deserving respect and understanding, empathy and kindness’. The report is based on evidence from 13,000 CQC inspections carried out last year. Inspectors found examples of nurses failing to close curtains when they were carrying out personal tasks, talking over patients and speaking to them in a ‘condescending or dismissive way’. Many hospitals had call bells out of reach, or their staff failed to answer them in a reasonable time.Many also failed to identify patients who were malnourished or to ensure they had food if they missed a set meal time because they were having an operation. Short-staffing at almost a quarter of nursing homes and 16 per cent of hospitals was putting the quality and safety of care at risk, it found. Not having enough staff was a ‘major ingredient’ of poor care. Where ‘staff are stretched’ standards slip, the report said. Fourteen per cent of hospitals and no fewer than 33 per cent of nursing homes failed to give and keep medicines correctly. Three quarters of nursing homes failed to train staff correctly. Eleven per cent of hospitals failed to ensure decent cleanliness and infection control. Failings: Too many doctors, nurses and care home staff see patients not as people but as tasks to be completed, the Care Quality Commission found . The Mail has long exposed poor treatment of the elderly in hospitals, nursing homes and residential homes as part of its Dignity For The Elderly campaign. The State of Care report blamed the failings on a culture where ‘the unacceptable becomes the norm’. 'This report is a serious indictment of the way that older people are cared for in England today' Age UK director general Michelle Mitchell . It said: ‘Those who are responsible for the training and development of staff need to look hard at why “care” often seems to be broken down into tasks to be completed – focusing on the unit of work, rather than the person who needs to be looked after. It is not good enough and it is not what people want and expect. Kindness and compassion cost nothing.’ The CQC, which regulates health and social care in England, said it found too many hospitals and homes where patients are treated as objects. ‘A lack of dignity and respect is a persistent issue and one that has been hard to shift,’ the report said. ‘Staff have a huge responsibility to see past the illness or condition and to the patient as a person.’ In care homes, the report condemned examples of poor care including cutting up someone’s food without asking them, and ‘getting people ready for bed at a time that suits staff rather than the individual people being cared for’. Lack of help with eating and drinking is a real concern, the report found. Age UK’s charity director general, Michelle Mitchell, said: ‘This report is a serious indictment of the way that older people are cared for in England today. ‘It is appalling that 15 per cent of hospitals and 20 per cent of nursing homes failed to ensure people were given the food and drink they needed and that a significant proportion were equally unable to protect the dignity and respect of their patients and residents.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘There can be no hiding place for those providing poor care.’ Needed paramedics: Harold Massey holding one of his grandchildren . War veteran Harold Massey, 83, died  at a care home after a nurse refused to call an ambulance. Staff noticed that the great-grandfather – who had been transferred to the Bupa nursing home six days earlier – was  ‘blue-grey in colour’ and in obvious pain. But when care assistants told senior nurse Carmelita Castro he needed an ambulance, she rang the out-of-hours GP instead. As Mr Massey deteriorated, she ignored further pleas to call paramedics and gave him constipation medicine instead. He died of a severe water infection an hour later, before the doctor arrived. Coroner John Pollard told an inquest earlier this year that the efforts of Miss Castro, who was trained in her native Philippines, ‘fell well short’ of expectations. Mr Massey was a sergeant in Burma in the Second World War before settling in Flixton, Greater Manchester, where he worked for a steel firm. He moved to his first care home in 2006 after developing dementia but in 2009 an ulcer on his leg was left unchecked and ultimately led to amputation. Shortly afterwards, his two daughters moved him to Bupa’s Barton Brook home in Eccles. He died six days later, on December 28, 2009. The coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes but said the care Mr Massey received had been ‘minimal, unprofessional and ineffective’.","Ten per cent of NHS hospitals and 15 per cent of care homes failed to treat elderly people with sufficient dignity and respect, a watchdog found .

Sir John Major yesterday warned Tory rebels not to commit ‘regicide’ by getting rid of David Cameron.The former prime minister said it was ‘inevitable’ that Mr Cameron would have critics in the party after more than two years in power. But he told disgruntled Tory backbenchers that in-fighting would cost the party votes at the next general election. Disaffected MPs from across the party are said to be plotting to oust the Prime Minister. Up to 14 have reportedly written letters demanding his resignation and are canvassing colleagues to do the same. Support: Former Prime Minister John Major has urged Tory rebels to stop plotting to oust David Cameron . They are furious that faithful ministers and whips were sacked without explanation in the recent reshuffle. Former Army colonel Patrick Mercer was yesterday named as one of the rebels who have written to Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee. A leadership contest would be triggered if more than 46 MPs followed his example. One MP said: ‘A lot of people feel we have reached the crucial tipping point. I think the plot is credible.’ But Sir John said: ‘I would have . thought that if the Conservative Party has learned anything in the last . 20 years, it’s that regicide is not a good idea. Former Army colonel Patrick Mercer was yesterday named as one of the rebels . ‘My message to them is: Look at history. Disunity costs votes, unity helps a government achieve the changes in our economy that we wish to see – that’s good for the nation, good for the economy, good for them, and good for the next election.’ Sir John took over the Tory leadership in 1990 after Margaret Thatcher was challenged by Michael Heseltine. When the PM pulled out of the contest, Mr Heseltine failed to get enough votes and Mr Major won on the second ballot. In 1995, he was nearly a victim of the Tory Right when he resigned the leadership to stage a ‘back me or sack me’ contest. Former Tory leader William Hague once remarked that the Conservative Party operated like an ‘absolute monarchy, moderated by regicide’. Some rebels are said to want London Mayor Boris Johnson as PM. Sir John praised him as an ‘attractive’ politician, but added: ‘Boris isn’t in Parliament. Boris hasn’t said he wishes to become prime minister – quite the reverse. ‘The belief that suddenly everything is going to change – you’re going to have a leadership challenge and you’re going to have a replacement of the prime minister – I think isn’t in the real world.’ Former defence secretary Liam Fox urged the party to ‘fall behind’ Mr Cameron, quashing reports that he was plotting against the PM. Dr Fox, who is popular with the party Right, said: ‘We have a very good Prime Minister, we have a very good leadership in the party – we need to fall behind it. We need a robust debate, but having a robust debate is not the same as undermining the leadership.’ It emerged yesterday that US Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was mocked by Mr Cameron for suggesting the London Olympics would be a failure. Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein said Mr Cameron derided gaffe-prone Mr Romney, adding: ‘I witnessed David Cameron saying Mitt Romney had that unique distinction of uniting all of England against him.’",Up to 14 Tory rebels said to be plotting to oust the Prime Minister .

Two British women are to appear in court to defend the man charged with raping them in Barbados. University researcher Rachel Turner, 30, and retired primary school teacher Diane Davies, 63, are leading the fight to free Derick Crawford, who is accused of raping them in identical attacks on the Caribbean island. Crawford is said to claim a confession was beaten out of him. Meeting: Rachel Turner (left) and Diane Davies (centre) met Derick Crawford (right) outside the court in Holetown, Barbados . Savage: Mrs Davies' face was bruised and swollen after the attack, which left her with a broken collarbone and ribs . The women are so adamant he was not . their attacker that they have waived their anonymity to insist publicly . that police have arrested the wrong man. The latest hearing in the case . is due to take place today. Dr Turner, from Letchworth, . Hertfordshire, says their rapist is 10 to 15 years younger and bears no . resemblance to Mr Crawford, 48, who has already spent 18 months in jail . awaiting trial. This week, the women met their alleged . attacker for the first time after he was granted bail at a preliminary . hearing – and said they were now ‘100 per cent’ sure it was not him. In . an emotional meeting outside the courthouse, Mr Crawford thanked the . ‘very brave’ women for their support. Dr Turner moved to Barbados in 2010, to take up an environmental research post at the University of West Indies. She was walking along a beach in Holetown in October that year when she was dragged into a deserted hotel building and raped. Two days later Mrs Davies, who was on . holiday, was raped as she walked along the same beach path. The widow . and grandmother-of-nine, who lives in Anglesey, North Wales, suffered a . broken collarbone and ribs. Photo-fits of their attacker were so . similar that police initially mixed them up. But when officers arrested . Mr Crawford and asked the victims to identify him, both knew instantly . it was the wrong man. They say their protests were ignored . and that Mr Crawford was charged anyway to save the island’s reputation . as a holiday destination. Face-to-face: Hilary Heath (left) also met with Derick Crawford along with Rachel Turner and Diane Davies. The three British women are paying for an attorney to represent Mr Crawford . Support: The three British women have retained attorney Andrew Pilgrim (pictured) to represent Mr Crawford .

I have no doubts at all – this is not . the man who attacked me. Everything about him is wrong. He doesn’t fit . the appearance of my attacker in any way. He told us police beat him and . put a bag over his head to make him sign the confession.’ Mrs Davies, who returned to the island . for the court case, said: ‘I have stated categorically that is not the . man who attacked me. Convinced: Rachel Turner and Diane Davies say police have ignored their insistence that Derick Crawford is not the man who attacked them . Speaking out: The women have waived their right to anonymity to speak out as they believe the real rapist is still at large . ‘He is older and his features are . totally different.

Kirsty Brook's (left) baby Harry was born five weeks early in a hospital car park, delivered by his aunt Michelle (right) A woman was forced to deliver her nephew in a hospital car park and then give him the kiss of life after doctors sent his mother home prematurely. First-time mother Kirsty Brook, 30, had been to . hospital on November 13 fearing she was in labour, even though her baby wasn't due for another five weeks. But staff told her she simply had a urine infection and sent her home at 2pm that day. By 8pm it was clear Ms Brooke was indeed in  labour, so her sister, Michelle Brook-Lomas, drove her to hospital. However baby Harry was in such a rush to enter the world that she was forced to deliver him outside the entrance of Calderdale Royal Hospital in Halifax, West Yorkshire. And moments after delivering the little boy, she realised he wasn't breathing. Quick-thinking Ms Brook-Lomas, a former childminder, wiped the mucus from her tiny nephew’s mouth and gave him the kiss of life. Seconds later he began to cry. Medics rushed baby Harry into the hospital to check him over before reuniting him with his mother and father Mark. Baby Harry, who weighed 6st 3lb, was kept in hospital for five days and spent the first 24 hours in an incubator with oxygen and a heat lamp. Ms Brook, of Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, has now hit out at her treatment, saying the outcome could have been very different if it wasn’t for her sister. Harry's father Mark (pictured) was also in the car when Michelle gave his son the kiss of life . She said: 'I feel disgruntled about . it. I was a first-time mum, I didn’t know what was going on. I didn’t . know the difference between contractions and a water infection. 'It felt like they were trying to fob me off, as if they were saying ‘don’t be silly, you’re not in labour’. 'It was surreal, like it was happening to someone else. I just wanted to get to the hospital. 'Thankfully Michelle was there or else Harry may not have been here today. She was brilliant.' 'It wasn't the birth I was expecting,' said first-time mother Miss Brook . Full-time mother-of-three Ms Brook-Lomas, 34, who used her baby first-aid training from her former job as a childminder, said: 'I had asked Kirsty a few times if she wanted me to pull over as we drove to hospital but she said ""‘just get me there"". 'As we were approaching the hospital she said she wanted to push and when I saw the car park, I just did a handbrake turn across four spaces near the entrance, jumped out and Mark raced in to get the midwife. 'Kirsty was in the back seats and I talked her through it. It all happened within minutes. 'When the baby arrived he had mucus in his mouth so I wiped it out. He wasn’t breathing so I gave him the kiss of life, then he started crying and I gave him to Kirsty to do skin-to-skin. 'The medics came and the umbilical cord was cut before he was taken inside.' Ms Brook said: 'I was overjoyed when Harry started to cry. We all were. It wasn’t the birth I was expecting.' 'I felt my waters break that morning, but the hospital put a baby monitor on me, checked me over and sent me home. 'The pains kept getting worse and by about 8pm I went to my sister’s home and she suggested I have a bath. 'When I got out we timed the contractions at three minutes and phoned the hospital and they said to come in. 'I saw the doctor who sent us home . the next day and he said to me ""I’m so sorry, I haven’t got X-ray eyes. I . honestly believed you had a water infection"".' Baby Harry is now back at home with his parents. His mother added: 'He is wonderful. We are over the moon.' A spokesperson for Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are sorry to learn of these concerns and we would urge Miss Brook to contact us so we can discuss them with her.'","Kirsty Brook, 30, went into labour five weeks early .

That petition on Change.org, titled ‘Target: Take the high road and save Thanksgiving’, now has over 198,000 supporters, up from 100,000 earlier in the day. ‘I have worked at Target for six years and I really enjoy my job,’ writes the petitioner, ‘C.

The man who accused Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash of engaging in sex when he was underage has been identified as a 24-year-old wannabe model that was once arrested for allegedly robbing someone at knifepoint. The accuser, Sheldon Stephens, of Pennsylvania, was named by The Smoking Gun website on Wednesday. The website said it learned the identity of Stephens from a family member and friend who were not named. Stephens describes himself as an 'entrepreneur, student, model [and] actor' on his Twitter account. On his Facebook page, he writes, 'I like to consider myself a rare breed. I'm very spontaneous and random… I'm determined and goal oriented. My destiny is laid on a solid gold brick pathway... MY FUTURE IS BRIGHT and never will it dim.' Named: Sheldon Stephens, 24 of Pennsylvania, has been identified as the man who accused Elmo Muppeteer Kevin Clash of engaging in sex when he was underage . Stephens had publicly accused Clash, the puppeteer behind Elmo on Sesame Street, of an underage . sexual affair this week and then later recanted his claim. The recantation comes one day after . the accusations against Clash, who is openly gay, were published on TMZ, . setting off a firestorm in the media. Andreozzi & Associates, a law . firm that said it represented the accuser, said in a . statement on his behalf: . 'He wants it to be known that his . sexual relationship with Mr Clash was an adult consensual relationship. He will have no further comment on the matter.' Since the scandal broke, Clash, 52, . has taken a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop which produces the . popular children's TV show on PBS. Since the scandal broke, Clash, 52, has taken a leave of absence from the Sesame Workshop which produces the popular children's TV show on PBS . Court records show that Stephens has . been arrested several times since 2009 on charges that include writing a . bad check and reckless driving. His most serious charges were in . September of 2009, when he was arrested at an airport in Pennsylvania . after stepping off a flight from Los Angeles.He was charged in that arrest with robbing his former employer, Darian Pollard, at knifepoint. Pollard accused Stephens of stealing a $250,000 'white gold necklace with diamonds' and a 'white gold ring with diamond baguettes' and then boarding a flight to Pennsylvania, according to a criminal complaint. Stephens was wearing the jewelry when police arrested him and he insisted that the pieces were gifts. Charges filed against him in Pennsylvania were later dropped, however, and charges were never filed in California, The Smoking Gun reported. After Stephens withdrew his allegations, Clash told the New York Times through a . spokesman: 'I am relieved that this painful allegation has been put to . rest. I will not discuss it further.' Clash exchanged messages with his accuser in 2010 in which he apologized for constantly talking about sex and promised to make all of his 'dreams come true.' The puppeteer, who has left the show . in the wake of the accusations, told the man almost 30 years his junior . that he loved him and offered to buy him a ticket to visit him in New . York, it has emerged. The Sesame Street stalwart, who has worked on the show since the mid-80s, admits to having a sexual . relationship with the accuser but insists it only took place after the younger man was an adult. Clash, 52, took a leave of . absence from the children's show after the 23-year-old contacted the program's lawyers and told them he had a sexual . relationship with the puppeteer seven years ago. Allegations: Clash has left the popular children's show to fight the accusations . In the latest emails published by TMZ, sent well after the accuser turned 18, Clash wrote: 'I'm sorry that I keep talking about sex with you, its driving me insane.' He added: 'I want you to know that I love . you and I will never hurt you. I'm here to protect you and make sure . your dreams come true... 'I'll have my assistant book a ticket for you to come to NY and we can talk about this in person.' Clash said the relationship was between two consenting adults and that he was deeply . saddened that the younger man was 'trying to make it into something it was not.' The . accuser reportedly felt he was being silenced after his initial meeting with Sesame Street lawyers. He is now being represented by Andreozzi and Associates - the firm that worked with one of the victims . in the Jerry Sandusky child rape case. In August, the accuser's lawyers wrote a . letter to Sesame Street accusing the program of trying to 'discredit . the victim in order to protect its . employee and the image of one of its most valuable characters.' The letter also claimed the show's attitude 'places a greater value on a puppet than the well being of . a young man.' Sesame Workshop officials, however, said they found the  the allegation of underage sex was . unsubstantiated after a thorough . investigation. Iconic: Clash, left, who has voiced Elmo for two decades, admits he had a relationship with the man, but only after the accuser was an adult . They say that rather than trying to hush up the accuser, they asked for evidence of his allegations, which was not received. TMZ reported they had seen an email supposedly sent to the accuser by Clash, . acknowledging they had the affair when he was 16, but officials believe it is fake as they say the . accuser never mentioned such an email existed. Sesame Street disciplined Mr Clash . for inappropriate use of company email after they found his messages to . the accuser, but they reportedly did not indicate an illegal sexual . relationship. They said the divorced father of a 19-year-old girl had shown poor judgment, but claimed . his leave of absence was to allow him to defend his reputation in the wake of the damaging allegations. Clash's ex-wife, Gina, declined to comment, but a friend who answered the door at her Baltimore home told the New York Daily News that the former nurse is 'surviving'. In the spotlight: Clash, who joined Sesame Street in the mid-80s, sent his accuser emails promising to make his dreams come true .

Sesame Workshop insisted the scandal surrounding Clash does not mean the end of Elmo. 'Elmo is bigger than any one person,' the company said. Clash has been Elmo's puppeteer for two decades, performing on the show as well as for PBS specials, DVD releases and TV movies, while earning nine Daytime Emmy Awards. He eventually assumed the title of Sesame Street's Senior Puppet Coordinator and Muppet Captain, while also directing and producing show segments and TV specials. He published an autobiography about his career in 2006 called My Life as a Furry Red Monster: What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life, Love and Laughing Out Loud. Earlier this year he appeared in Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey, a documentary detailing Clash's journey from a childhood obsession with puppets to assuming his role on the iconic show.","Sheldon Stephens, 24, accused Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash of having sex with him when he was underage .

These atmospheric shots of herders and their camels trekking across the desert appear to hark back to a time before technology and industrialisation - but the images are actually of the world's largest camel fair still held every year in the middle of the Indian desert. Hundreds of herders descend upon Pushkar in the state of Rajasthan for the five-day annual camel and livestock fair. The Pushkar Fair, also known as the Pushkar ka Mela, is held on the banks of Pushkar Lake every November at the time of the Kartik Purnima full moon. The epic spectacle attracts 300,000 people and up to 20,000 camels, cattle and horses. The event, which sees tough bartering over livestock, has also become a major tourist attraction in recent years with a fair football match between the locals and visitors. A camel race starts off the festival followed by music performances and tough competitions such as the 'matka phod' meaning 'longest moustache' and a 'bridal competition'. While the herders deal livestock, many shoppers attend to visit the stalls of clothes and textiles. Scroll down for video .

But what mobile phone you own, the television programmes you watch and whether or not you have a Facebook page might also keep you youthful, according to new research. Owning an iPhone, watching reality television and beating younger relatives at games are just some of the secrets to keeping young, it emerged today. Silver surfer: Surfing the internet could make you feel younger according to the survey commissioned by Benenden Healthcare . And silver surfers, those who spend more time with their grandchildren or trying to catch the eye of someone younger tend to feel more alive. The study of 1,000 over 50’s found the secrets of youth the older generation rely on - with having regular sex, fancying a younger celebrity and knowing what Twitter is all likely to give a burst of life. The research, which was commissioned by healthcare specialist Benenden, found that age really is just a number with the average person claiming their youth secrets lead to them feeling 18 years younger than they are. Many of the 'older' generation thought staying up past midnight led to feeling alive, while eating spicy food and keeping in touch with the local gossip are guaranteed to keep a person fresh. Using smartphone apps, eating chocolate and having a younger partner all appeared to keep many an over fifty in good nick. Nine in ten or those surveyed thought that how old you feel as a person mostly depends on your outlook and attitude to life with 70 per cent also saying it’s crucial to laugh regularly. Generation gap: Spending time with the grandchildren is key to keeping youthful for many over 50s . The average respondent was aged 59 - but the age people actually felt was 18 years younger at 41. And sometimes feeling young means not always playing by the rules - four in ten describe themselves as rebellious, with more than a quarter saying they’ve received ‘a telling off’ while in their fifties. In fact, it seems forty per cent of over fifties have trespassed somewhere and a quarter admits they’ve broken the law since hitting half a century. Paul Keenan added: 'Of course, it’s not so much about feeling young as it is about feeling content in life and making time to do the things that make you happy. 'It can be a serious world and sometimes we can get wrapped up in it too much so it’s important not to lose sight of what keeps you feeling good about yourself. 'Whether that’s dancing, keeping tabs with what’s deemed ‘trendy’ or simply enjoying games with younger relatives, taking time to remember what you enjoy about life is crucial to approaching it in the right way.'

Sacked: Indian radiographer Ramani Ramaswany was dismissed from The Christie cancer hospital in Manchester after complaints that he could not speak clear English . An Indian radiographer has been sacked from his job at a cancer hospital after six years following a string of complaints that he could not speak clear English. Ramani Ramaswany was dismissed from The Christie hospital, in Manchester, and suspended from the national radiography register for a year after complaints were made against him that he was unable to communicate effectively with patients and colleagues. The Health and Care Professions Council found that Mr Ramaswamy had showed a ‘lack of competence’ in a number of areas while working at The Christie. The panel heard that patients and staff had difficulty understanding him, with his command of English said to be getting worse by managers at the hospital despite extra English lessons after taking a job there. He was also slammed for failing to demonstrate competent handling of equipment and setting up a bed so badly that a supervisor had to step in to stop a patient getting injured. Mr Ramaswarmy had asked a patient to confirm their name four times before a colleague was forced to intervene because neither the patient nor the member of staff could understand what he was saying. The radiographer, who lives in Moss Side, also failed to consistently ask patients to empty their bladders before procedures were carried out. A senior colleague described his practice as being ‘a bit of a hit or a miss’ and he often read out numbers incorrectly. The committee heard that Mr Ramaswamy was recruited from India as an experienced radiographer and started work in August 2005. Because of concerns over his communication skills, he was at first restricted to a role where he had no contact with patients. He was moved on to the treatment floor in September 2009 for a three-month trial but this proved unsuccessful. Cancer Hospital: The Christie in Manchester where Dr Ramaswany worked . He was then closely-monitored and an improvement plan was put in place. In June last year, his performance was rated as ‘unacceptable’ in every area. He was suspended and dismissed after a hearing in August last year and he has now been struck off for a year. The panel’s report said: 'On one occasion, a patient had become distressed. 'His communication skills, even after six years at the trust, were poor and he was recorded as keeping his communication with patients to a minimum and to be difficult to understand. 'The deficiencies identified by the panel have the potential to cause serious harm to patients.' Mr Ramaswamy said that the sanctions were unfair and the allegations had been ‘cooked up’. He said he had now retired and was not looking for work, adding: 'It’s totally ridiculous. I previously worked in Malaysia and I was very well respected. 'The Christie said there were communication problems but I speak good English. I may be a little reserved.' When asked about failing to ask patients to empty their bladders before starting treatment he said: 'Maybe I missed it for one patient. I’ve never done any harm to the patients.; . A spokesman for The Christie said that no treatments were affected and no patients were put at risk by Mr Ramaswamy. He added: 'He spent the vast majority of his time in treatment planning which involves no contact with patients. 'We are satisfied that our systems and processes have enabled us to identify this problem and deal with it appropriately.'","Ramani Ramaswany was dismissed from The Christie cancer hospital in Manchester .

The bad taste fancy-dress event was organised by members of St Cuthbert’s Society Men’s Rugby Club at Durham University. St Cuthbert’s - one of the . university’s most successful college sides - has been forbidden from . playing for the rest of the term after first-year players dressed up as . young girls, second years wore Savile outfits, and third and fourth . years came as police officers or Panorama journalists.

On top of the inappropriate theme, it . is alleged one person stripped off, another tried to steal a dartboard . from a rival college bar and more players set off a fire alarm. Members have also been barred from at least two college bars. A Durham University spokesman said: 'The university has been made aware of an incident. 'We take such matters very seriously.

It is understood organisers of the event, on October 25, have been ordered to carry out unpaid work and £50 fines have been imposed on players.

A member of the team, who did not want to be named, said he was ‘disillusioned’ with the process. 'Playing bans are unprecedented,' he said. 'Other colleges have had numerous disciplinary hearings, while the university rugby club, DURFC, have been involved in several serious incidents that have not resulted in playing bans. 'Would DURFC ever be banned from playing? Absolutely not.' The college rugby team has one of the most successful records in Durham,  winning the Men’s Premiership five times in the last seven years. However, on the Men’s Premier League website, the team has already been dropped to the bottom of the table and a loss of 40-0 will be recorded for every game until their ban has ended.","Durham's St Cuthbert’s Rugby Club banned from matches until Christmas .

Appeal: DJ Chris Moyles tried to keep his name secret during an HMRC appeal hearing as his lawyers claimed to reveal his identity would infringe his human rights, it has been revealed . Chris Moyles is engulfed in a privacy scandal as it emerged today he fought to keep his membership of a tax-avoidance scheme secret claiming unmasking him would 'infringe' his human rights. The former Radio 1 breakfast show host, who earned a £500,000 annual salary until he left his job in September, asked a tax tribunal to grant him anonymity in his battle with HM Revenue and Customs. Mr Moyles was a member of a 'marketed tax-avoidance scheme' which HMRC said did not work, but the broadcaster appealed that decision and asked that the press and public be prevented from knowing the case involved him. Usually that appeal would be heard in public but the legal team acting for the self-appointed 'saviour of Radio 1' argued he was 'fearful' his career would be damaged should be be exposed as an aggressive tax-avoider. But the judge considering the case dismissed his plea saying there was 'obvious public interest' in naming him adding the rich and famous should be treated like everyone else. 'If it were to become public knowledge that he availed himself of a tax-avoidance scheme, his career might be damaged and his earning capacity reduced,' Judge Colin Bishopp said when summarising the DJ's arguments. 'He is already the focus of media interest for other reasons, much of it hostile,' he added. At the heart of the DJ's claim to be protected was that 'adverse media comment' would deny him the 'right to respect for his private and family life' But Judge Bishopp disagreed, adding: 'The fact that a taxpayer is rich, or that he is in the public eye, does not seem to me to dictate a different approach. 'On the contrary, it may be that hearing the appeal of such a person in private would give rise to the suspicion that riches or fame can buy anonymity, and protection from the scrutiny which others cannot avoid.' Exit: After years on the Radio 1 breakfast show Chris Moyles, 38, left in September but says his career would be damaged if he was revealed to be involved in the HMRC appeal case . In spite of his ruling, at London’s Upper Tribunal in July, Judge Bishopp made it clear that HMRC did not claim that Moyles had behaved unlawfully. The Times said yesterday it established that the man referred to as 'Mr A' in the court papers was Chris Moyles. The BBC has been widely criticised for allowing staff to be paid 'off the books' with at least 120 stars earning more than £150,000 being paid in this way. It is not clear, however, if Mr Moyles has funnelled his BBC earnings via a tax avoidance scheme but the corporation confirmed he is still under contract with them. Avoidance: It comes just months after it was revealed that Jimmy Carr was paying as little as 1% tax via a scheme . BBC rules say that their staff must pay 'an appropriate amount of tax' and a spokesman added that aggressive tax avoidance would 'very likely' break those rules. In some cases this could lead to disciplinary proceedings and even get the sack. MailOnline has attempted to contact My Moyles's representatives but they have not responded. His claim for anonymity is just another attempt for the rich and powerful to avoid open justice, Mark Stephens, one of Britain's leading privacy lawyers has said. He added he was astonished Mr Moyles had been advised to seek a gagging order in these circumstances. 'He has effectively made worse a situation which was already bad. For the last five years the courts have provided people in the public eye with a degree of privacy, but many judges are now looking much more rigorously at whether privacy is genuinely needed,' he told The Times. 'If there’s some measure of public interest, as there would be in this case, the courts are starting to re- apply principles of open justice.' In June comedian Jimmy Carr – who in the past had publicly mocked tax avoidance – was revealed as one of thousands of people using a legal off-shore scheme to pay as little as 1 per cent income tax. He is believed to have been the largest beneficiary of the K2 accountancy arrangement, said to shelter £168million a year from the taxman. He put away £3.3million a year via the K2 tax scheme, it was claimed. K2 works by transferring salaries into a Jersey-based trust, which lends investors back the money. Because the loan can technically be recalled, it is not subject to income tax.","Broadcaster in dispute with HMRC after he joined legal avoidance group .

A thug who sparked an armed police raid when terrified residents mistook a sex toy for a gun has been jailed for five years. Ian Poulton, 33, was arrested when 15 officers armed with machine guns swooped on a quiet street in Telford, Shropshire in May this year. Police were alerted when residents reported seeing a man with a concealed weapon tucked into the waistband of his trousers. But it turned out the suspected handgun was actually a sex toy. Poulton, from Wellington, Shropshire, was jailed for five years after he admitted possessing an item which had the appearance of a handgun with intent to cause fear of violence. He also admitted at Shrewsbury Crown Court to assaulting his neighbour Jose Luis Candelaria, causing him actual bodily harm, on the same day. Jailing Poulton, Judge Robin Onions said: 'It was clearly not a gun, be it imitation or real. 'It was an entirely innocent object. It was the defendant's intention to deceive. 'Witnesses thought is was a firearm so he has to take the consequences.' Poulton also pleased guilty to separate charges of causing criminal damage to a police car and laptop and aggravated vehicle taking. He was also banned from driving for three years and made the subject of three restraining orders. Rhiannon Jones, prosecuting, said shortly after 2pm on May 22, witnesses thought they had seen a man carrying a gun in the Hall Gardens area of Hadley.

When armed police arrived minutes later, arrested Poulton and seized the weapon, they discovered it was in fact a 'sex aid'. Speaking at the time of the incident, West Mercia Police said: 'A member of the public reported to us that a man had been seen with a firearm in the Hall Gardens area of Hadley.

Turmoil in the Tory party seemed liked a million miles away as Nadine Dorries turned her attention to her tan in I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! Nadine Dorries has tried to defend her appearance on I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! by comparing her jaunt to the time ministers spend abroad on official visits. The MP was suspended by the Tory Party for failing to tell the Chief Whip she was jetting off to Australia to appear on the reality TV show. And it was confirmed yesterday that she is being investigated by the Parliamentary Standards Officer over claims she may have breached the MPs’ Code of Conduct. Mrs Dorries, 55, could be away from the House of Commons for up to a month but is still drawing her £65,738 MP’s salary, while being paid up to £40,000 by ITV. Astonishingly, the Mid-Bedfordshire MP justified her appearance on the show by saying she ‘mostly works seven days a week’ and ministers are often out of the country. In an interview given before she left Britain, she claimed neighbouring MP Alistair Burt frequently travelled abroad without criticism in his role as a foreign minister. Mrs Dorries – who has been pictured sunbathing topless during a pre-show stay at a luxury hotel – said: ‘In his ministerial role he has had 20 weeks abroad this year. But do they say when he is in Qatar for weeks that he is neglecting his constituency?’ She claimed her constituents would understand why she has gone on the show. Last night in Brussels, Mr Burt, the MP for North East Bedfordshire, said: ‘I am surprised Nadine believes there is some similarity between me being abroad on behalf of the British people, including my constituents, and her taking part in a TV show in the jungle.’ A chaperone applies sun cream to Nadine Dorries as the Tory MP relaxes by a pool on the gold coast before entering the jungle for I'm a celebrity get me out of here . One of Ms Dorries' daughters revealed last night she has taken over her Twitter account, posting updates to her 12,000 followers . The show’s producers are understood . to have told Mrs Dorries that she has been suspended by her party but . sources in Australia say she has apparently decided to press ahead with . her appearance on the show. An update to her 12,000 followers on twitter read: 'Hello! I can confirm Nadine Dorries MP is in the jungle! I (her daughter) will be covering her Twitter in the meantime!' It is thought the tweets are being posted by Ms Dorries daughter Cassie. It also emerged today that Ms Dorries could be investigated over the revelations she kept another daughter, Philippa, on the public payroll as a parliamentary aide even after she had joined a major law firm as a full-time trainee. Philippa is listed on the register of MPs' interests as an 'Office Manager/Executive Secretary' in her mother's office, despite joining Mischon De Reya in August. Ms Dorries agent insisted Philippa stopped working for her mum in August and the record had not been updated. Earlier this year Philippa was revealed to be dating Tory MP Chris Kelly. David Cameron interrupted a visit to Jordan to distance himself from the decision to suspend Ms Dorries from the Tory party, insisting it was made by Chief Whip Sir George Young . Speculation has grown that Mrs Dorries could defect to UKIP after she emerges from the jungle. Bookies Ladbrokes slashed the odds that she would jump ship, making it just 2/1 that Mrs Dorries would join UKIP before the next election and 5/1 that she would leave she leaves politics for good. UKIP leader Nigel Farage tried the play down an imminent defection, saying: ‘I haven’t had an application, she is in the jungle for a month.’ He added: ‘I wish her well with the creepy crawlies in the jungle as opposed to the creepy crawlies in Westminster.’ Mr . Farage said the Conservative party had gone too far in suspending Mrs . Dorries: ‘If one of my MEPs who was not a frontbench spokesman decided . to go into the jungle, I would see it as an opportunity to reach an . audience of 16 million.’ Ms Dorries has long been linked with a defection to the UK Independence Party, but sources warn of a 'personality clash' with leader Nigel Farage . UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom said he would delighted if Mrs Dorries eventually joined UKIP. ‘We like her, she is feisty and has balls.’ He added: ‘I’m not sure this jungle thing is a good idea, I’d rather she came straight to us.

But . as fellow MPs reacted with fury to Ms Dorries, they were quickly . briefing that Mr Cameron had decided she should be reprimanded. In another change of tone, Mr Cameron did nothing to claim the credit yesterday. In . his first comments on the affair, he said at the close of his visit to . the Middle East: ‘I think the Chief Whip has made the right decision, . he’s responsible for these things. I think it was well made, well . explained and he’s done the right thing.’ The . change of heart suggests the premier does not want to be seen to have . over-reacted to a woman who once described Mr Cameron and the Chancellor . as ‘two arrogant posh boys’. But a poll of 5,500 people for AOL.com . showed the public was overwhelmingly behind the decision to suspend Mrs . Dorries. Some 86 per cent backed the action, while just ten per cent . thought the Tory party was wrong to suspend her. Louise Mensch - the outgoing Tory MP . for Corby who stood down last month to spend more time with her rock . band manager husband in America - accused Mrs Dorries of ‘demeaning’ parliament. Mrs . Mensch added: ‘Celebrity is fleeting; laws actually matter. I envy and . honour my former colleagues, on all sides, who are still making them.’ Other senior politicians also poked fun at Mrs Dorries during Prime Minister’s Questions. Nick . Clegg, standing in for Mr Cameron, said: ‘When I heard she had been . sent to the jungle to eat insects, I thought that despite the appearance . of civility from our new chief whip, this indicated a new . disciplinarian approach in our whips’ office,’ he said. Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman added: 'I am beginning to have quite a lot of sympathy with (Ms Dorries). All those rats and snakes... and that’s before she went to the jungle.’ But former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, who has also been on the show, tweeted: ‘Pls back Nadine Dorries - victim of witch hunt by her party, and ‘on trial’ with no opportunity to even know she’s been suspended.’","Parliamentary Standards Commissioner asked to investigate claim she has broken MPs' code of conduct .

Ed Balls appears determined to shed his tough man reputation by shedding a few tears . Labour bruiser Ed Balls it seems cannot stop blubbing. The shadow chancellor has previously . claimed to have been moved to tears by Antiques Roadshow, the Sound of . Music and a cartoon version of Robin Hood. Now in his latest attempt to prove . that he is really a big softie, the 45-year-old claims he keeps crying . while watching US sitcom Modern Family. Together with his public boasts of . being a great cook –  14-hour pulled pork South Carolina barbecue being a speciality – and . learning to play the piano, Mr Balls seems determined to persuade voters . he is not the political hardman of Westminster legend. As one of Gordon Brown’s closest . advisors Mr Balls has a reputation as a bruiser who regulalrly briefed . against colleagues when Labour was in power. But after losing out to Ed Miliband for the Labour leadership, he has made a concerted effort to show off his softer side. In a new interview with House . magazine, which is circulated around Parliament, he reveals Modern . Family is one of his favourite series. ‘The reason why the programme is so brilliant is there's a little bit of [lead character] Phil Dunphy in all of us,’ he said. But he went on to claim to have been . moved to tears by an episode in which Phil and wife Claire drop off . daughter Haley at university for the first time. ‘I cry every time I see that. Every . time. It is all about the vulnerability of the daughter…and it captures . the sort of dilemmas of parenting in a teenager.’ He went on: ‘Dads are supposed to be a . bit embarrassing, but of course you always think to yourself at key . moments, “was that a bit embarrassing?” ‘But actually it’s sort of what you’re . supposed to do and it’s always really important to remember that you're . appreciated for being a bit embarrassing, even if it may not feel like . it at the time.’ Scroll down for video . Modern man: Mr Balls claimed to have wept when watching an episode of Modern Family. when parents Phil and Claire take daughter Haley (right) to university . He reveals his own children Ellie, . Joe, and Madelyn were left ‘appalled’ after one of his tweets was read . out live on the X-Factor last week. He wrote on Twitter: ‘For the . avoidance of doubt “Call Me Maybe” is the song of 2012.. But (in the . absence of the fab Misha B) I'm voting for Ella.’ X-Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger was taken aback, and asked: ‘Is he really called Ed Balls?’ before adding: ‘Vote for Balls!’ He then tweeted Scherzinger direct: ‘Hey @NicoleScherzy .. This is Crazy .. Thanks for the shout-out.. Call me maybe.’ ‘It certainly enlivened our sitting room’, he jokes, though his children ‘were appalled’. It is unclear what they make of the fact he seems unable to switch on the TV without breaking down. The shadow chancellor claims to cry watching Antiques Roadshow when someone learns their heirloom is worth a fortune and earlier this year revealed he first cried watching Disney 1973 film version of Robin Hood . His claim to cry at Modern Family . comes a year to the day after he gave an interview revealing he blubbed . at Antiques Roadshow. ‘You know, when someone comes in with some family . heirloom and it’s often the last bit in the programme and the expert . says, “Do you know how much this is worth? It’s valued at X thousand . pounds.” ‘And they say, “I’m amazed it’s worth that much, but it means more to me than money.” Incredibly emotional.’ Children singing in harmony in the Sound of Music is also said to move Mr Balls to tears . The 45-year-old has boasted of his culinary prowess, offering to cook George Osborne  a 14-hour pulled pork South Carolina barbecue . In the same interview with Total . Politics magazine he admitted to shedding a tear at the scene from the . Sound of Music ‘when the father brings the Baroness back from . Vienna...and the children sing the Sound of Music in harmony with the . guitar’. Earlier this year he revealed he first cried at a film aged five or six, watching the 1973 Disney version of Robin Hood. He told The Times of the moment he . welled-up: ‘There is a point where the rabbits have saved up all year to . give the little rabbit a gold coin for his birthday and then the . Sheriff of Nottingham comes in and says “I’ve come to collect the . taxes.” And he takes the gold coin!’Mr Balls has also boasted of his . efforts to learn how to play the piano – passing the Grade 1 exam . normally taken by children – and his prowess on the drums. Earlier this month he revealed he would appear as a guest drummer for folk-rock band Clogiron. The confessions to weeping are seen in Westminster as an attempt to soften his hard man image . Last year Mr Balls also passionately revealed he was a big fan on One Man And His Dog. 'The relationship between the farmer and his dog, the skill, the countryside, the music – it's a fabulous programme,"" he told the Independent on Sunday. 'The world divides into those people who like watching One Man and His Dog and those who don't. And I've always liked One Man and His Dog.' He insisted it was one of the few programmes not to make him cry, but added: 'You see the guy, he's trained his dog, and he's so proud of the dog, and you can just see that relationship. It's about a celebration of relationships; it's a big deal.'

Breaking into a bookshop before sitting down to read a copy of Fly Fishing by J R Hartley can hardly be described as a typical Saturday night out. But that’s what one drunk man ended up doing before he called the police to confess his crime. Clive Crittenden had been out drinking in Tonbridge, Kent and was on his way home in the early hours with a kebab in hand when he broke into the Mr Books store. Scroll down for video . Not your average Saturday night: Clive Crittenden broke into Mr Books in Tonbridge, Kent before he started reading a copy of Fly Fishing by JR Hartley . Shop owner Mark Richardson told the . Kent and Sussex Courier that books were thrown around the shop, items . swept off the counter and an antique bookslide and a wooden box . containing small change smashed during the 3.30am incident. The 50-year-old said: ‘The first I . knew of it was about 9am on Sunday when I found answering machine . messages from my landlord and the police. ‘My initial feeling was of shock and sheer horror and I was worried about what damage had been done. ‘It's fortunate that he hasn't damaged . any of the really valuable stuff as he must have been blundering round . in the dark. It's just a mess, really.’ The shop owner said that books were thrown around the shop (interior pictured) and items swept off the counter during the incident . After stealing  some £1 coins, Crittenden settled down to read the book which was immortalised in the popular 1983 . Yellow Pages TV advertisement. Mr Richardson added: ‘He actually said to the police he was sitting in my shop reading Fly Fishing by JR Hartley. ‘I think they thought he was taking the mickey at first but there is actually a copy right by the phone. ‘It’s a book that I’ve had in the . window before because it symbolises that I can get anything for you. His . choice of book adds to the bizarreness of the whole situation. Crittenden sat reading the book with a kebab in hand. The title was named after the book in 1983 Yellow Pages advert (pictured) ‘I even think in a strange sort of way that might have brought him to his senses.’ The book was written by author . Michael Russell under the pseudonym of JR Hartley to cash in on the . success of the TV advertisement which shows an elderly man calling round . various bookshops looking for a copy of a ‘rather old’ book that he had . written years before. He is told by all that the book is . not in stock and it is only when his daughter picks up a copy of Yellow . Pages that he tracks down a copy. When the advertisement was aired, . the book was purely fictional but in 1991, Mr Russell published Fly . Fishing: Memories of Angling Days. The advert (pictured) showed the fictional author JR Hartley trying to track down a copy of his book about fly fishing . After spending some time reading . the book, while eating a kebab and drinking a bottle of water, . Crittenden was ‘overcome with remorse’ and dialled 999 from the . bookshop’s phone to confess the crime. According to owner Mr Richardson, . Crittenden told police that he was reading Fly Fishing by JR Hartley and . that officers initially thought he was joking when he called at 4am. He added: ‘The detective described . it as a one-off, what with him phoning to get himself arrested. It . sounds funny after the event but it isn’t really funny at all.'

When Cheryl Cole stepped into Japanese restaurant Zuma last night for Kimberley Walsh's birthday party last night wearing a skintight leather dress, it was a wonder one of the sushi chefs didn't chop off his finger in shock. The Girls Aloud singer and former X Factor star looked jaw-dropping in the stretch mustard number,  a £1,800 piece from Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's luxury label The Row. But for those of us without an A-list bank account, is it possible to get a flash of that Cole magic in our wardrobes? Getting leathered! Cheryl Cole looked stunning last night in a light tan leather dress for bandmate Kimberley Walsh's birthday party at Knightsbridge restaurant Zuma . The short answer is yes. Leather brand Kaliko have a lookalike tan leather dress, which is available at House of Fraser for £150, and currently discounted at £115 at Debenhams. Of course, the High Street version is less likely to cling in all the right places in the way that Cheryl's does. Leaving aside for a moment the fact that most of us could only dream of having the body of the petite yet curvy star, the leather on the designer version is stretchy and buttersoft - making it comfortable and flattering to wear. CREDIT: £1,800 (LEFT) Cheryl Cole's leather dress cost £1,800 from the Olsen's brand The Row. CASH: £150  (RIGHT)  Kaliko's version is on sale for £150 at House of Fraser and has been reduced to £115 in the sale at Debenhams . The High Street version likely does not have the same element of stretch (it is very costly to create buttersoft leather with decent stretch, hence why J Brand's leather jeans sell for upwards of £800 and Sandro's stretch leather leggings are a credit card-scorching £645.). But for the price and the overall appeal of the look, the bargainista's leather dress can't be beaten. Surprisingly enough, a leather dress is a more versatile garment than you'd think too. Glam up with glossy hair, a slash of red lipstick and bare legs for a high maintenance look, or dress down with tights, boots and a chunky cardigan for weekend wear.","Cheryl's stretch leather dress is by Olsen twins' brand The Row .

Booking sheet: Gabriel Aubry was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of battery and bail was set at $20,000 . Gabriel, . a French-Canadian model who lives and works in Los Angeles, had petitioned the . court to stop Halle's plans to move to France with Nahla.

In her custody battle, Halle claimed Los Angeles was not the ideal place for her daughter to grow up, . due to the constant glare of the paparazzi.

Greek authorities need to take rapid action against malaria as recent outbreaks have exposed the already crisis-hit country to a possible re-establishment of the disease, scientists in Athens said today. Several cases of malaria have been discovered in the southern regions of Lakonia and East Attica, and researchers warned that stricter controls are needed. Greece's healthcare system has already suffered severe budget cuts, and experts fear vulnerable groups are not getting sufficient treatments. Further crisis: Cuts to public services such as hospitals have been cause of protest in Greece in the past, but scientists fear authorities may have a new crisis on their hands with recent malaria outbreaks . ‘It is clear that surveillance and vector control programmes should be strengthened and rapidly intensified,’ researchers at the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (HCDCP), wrote in online journal Eurosurveillance. They urge the Greek authorities to take measures such as insecticide spraying, eliminating standing water and tracking . mosquito populations as well as people infected with the disease. This year Greece has reported 75 cases of malaria. Most were contracted abroad but 16 cases were local. The American Centre for Disease Control are advising visitors to the worst hit region, Evrotas, to take antimalarial pills, according to the Telegraph. Malaria, which causes high fever and . chills and kills hundreds of thousands of people a year worldwide, was . once endemic in Greece but was officially eliminated in 1974. However, . Greece has established populations of potentially malarial mosquito . species, and last year, 40 cases of locally-acquired malaria were . reported, mainly in Lakonia and Attica. Danger: Malaria is contracted through mosquito bites and is common in Africa and Asia although scientists warn that it may return to Greece unless authorities take action . Apostolos Veizis, director of medical-operational support for Medecins Sans Frontieres in Greece, warned in a statement earlier this month that any malaria plan could not work properly unless access to healthcare was available to all. 'It is very important to monitor the situation and invest in mosquito control,"" he said. ""But medically speaking if people cannot be examined and properly diagnosed, it's easy to lose sight of the problem.' The HCDCP experts said a coordinated effort had begun with the collaboration of Greek authorities, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and World Health Organisation (WHO) experts to prevent malaria returning.",Greek scientists warn authorities to take action against disease .

Babies born prematurely are at higher risk of developing severe mental health problems as adults, warn researchers. A major study suggests those born after just seven months in the womb or earlier are at highest risk compared with full-term babies. They could be up to seven times more likely to develop bipolar disorders and at three times the risk of severe depression and eating disorders. Increased risk: Babies born more than eight weeks premature are '4.5 times as likely' to suffer from a severe mental illness such as depression, bipolar disorder or psychosis . But even those born four to eight weeks early are more likely to develop schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. The study, published in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, is the first to show a link between prematurity and a broad range of psychiatric disorders in later life. The chance of pre-term babies needing hospital treatment for any mental health condition is 4 in 1,000 – double the risk of babies born after nine months in the womb. But the risk for very premature babies who spent less than seven months in the womb is six per 1,000 births. Researchers at the Institute of Psychiatry (IoP) at King’s College London and Karolinska Institute in Sweden believe subtle alterations in brain development caused by being born early could be responsible, rather than restricted growth or lack of oxygen during childbirth. Doctors are concerned about rising numbers of premature babies – which are defined as being born at least three weeks early, when they have spent fewer than 37 rather than 40 weeks in the womb. Previous research found that babies born three months early – before 28 weeks - were most likely to suffer medical complications, learning difficulties or other handicaps, leading to a £1 billion bill for extra health and education needs each year. Doctors are concerned about rising numbers of premature babies - which are defined as being born at least three weeks early . The latest study had data from nearly 1.5 million birth and medical records in Sweden between 1973 and 1985 and identified all those admitted to hospital with their first episode of a psychiatric disorder by 2002. The researchers found that individuals born very prematurely after fewer than 32 weeks in the womb were three times more likely to be hospitalised with a psychiatric disorder at 16 years and older, compared to those born at term – 37 weeks or later. The risk varied depending on the condition - for psychosis it was 2.5 more likely, for depression three times more likely and for bipolar disorder 7.4 times more likely. The findings also revealed a smaller increased risk for moderately premature babies born between 32-36 weeks. They were 2.7 times more at risk of bipolar disorder and 1.3 times more at risk of serious depression but not more likely to have an eating disorder. Lead author Dr Chiara Nosarti, of the IoP . at King’s, said ‘We found a very strong link between premature birth . and a range of psychiatric disorders. ‘Since we considered only the most severe cases that resulted in hospitalisation, it may be that in real terms this link is even stronger. ‘However, it is important to remember that even with the increased risk, these disorders still only affect between one and six per cent of the population.’ She said ‘We believe that the increased risk of mental disorders in those born very prematurely can be explained by subtle alterations of brain development.’ The team ruled out restricted growth or oxygen deprivation during delivery as possible causes. Dr Nosarti said ‘The strongest association we found in this study was to mental health disorders known to have a strong biological basis, such as bipolar disorder, further adding to the theory that neurodevelopmental differences in those born prematurely may play an important role for later mental health.’ Approximately 1 in 13 children is born prematurely in the UK every year, and as a group they are more likely to require extra school support and be hospitalised with a variety of physical problems. Dr Nosarti said medical advances kept premature babies alive today who would not have survived 30 years ago. She stressed most premature babies would not be affected by psychiatric illness, but it was important to identify children who might be susceptible as adults at an early stage. They could be given extra support both pre-school and at school, she added, while doctors develop interventions to protect the brain when babies are born early such as head cooling.",Study of 1.3m Swedish medical records reveals that premature babies are more likely to experience mental health problems that extend into adulthood .
"Attack blamed on Lashkar-e-Jhangvi - one of Pakistan's most violent anti-Shi'ite groups and part of an Al Qaeda-linked nexus of militants . Karzai cuts Europe trip on future of Afghanistan short to visit injured in hospital . By . Ian Drury, Defence Correspondent . UPDATED: . 13:49 EST, 7 December 2011 . A former British ambassador to Afghanistan today denounced the 2014 deadline for the withdrawal of troops from the country as a further bombing in the country claimed the lives of 19 civilians. Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, ambassador from 2007 to 2009, said the move was 'worse than questionable, it's disgraceful' if it was not accompanied by a determined peace process. Nato troops, including UK forces, are to be withdrawn from combat roles by 2015. His comments come as Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai today vowed to confront the Pakistani government over yesterday's devastating suicide bombing against a Shiite shrine in Kabul. The attack on the holiest day of the Shia calendar killed 59, including one U.S. citizen. After flying back from Europe, Hamid Karzai visited victims wounded in Tuesday's suicide bomb attack at the Emergency Hospital in Kabul . Grieving: Afghans carry a body in a funeral procession through the streets of Kabul today. A suicide bomber targeted worshippers outside a shrine . Distraught: A relative cries near the grave of a victim of yesterday's bomb attack. Yesterday's blast marked the first major assault on a Muslim sect in Afghanistan in recent memory . Mr Karzai said the attack originated . in Pakistan, putting further pressure on already strained relations . between the two neighbours. Relations dropped to a new low after a Nato . air strike hit an army checkpoint in north-west Pakistan killing 24 . soldiers. Ever since then Pakistan has blocked Nato supplies heading through its country to Afghanistan. The Afghan leader today visited a hospital where scores of people who had been wounded in yesterday's attack were being treated. 'We are investigating this issue and we are going to talk to the Pakistani government about it,' he said. Nato oil tankers are seen in southern Pakistan's Karachi. The country's security forces have blocked Nato supplies to Afghanistan after a Nato ir strike hit an army checkpost in the north-west of the country . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and European Union High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Catherine Ashton (right) today at the start of the Nato Foreign Ministers council at Nato headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. On the agenda for the 28 NATO ministers are the alliance's operations in Afghanistan . He said the attack was not just an act of hate against Muslims, but against mankind. 'Afghanistan cannot ignore the blood . of all the victims of this incident, especially the children,' he added. Karzai cut short a European trip and returned to Kabul this morning . because of the attack. Today's slaughter was caused when a . roadside bomb in Helmand Province struck a minibus struck in the Taliban . stronghold of Sangin, where more than 100 UK soldiers lost their lives . during the war. Sir Sherard, an outspoken critic of . the government's tactics, said: 'It is very questionable - it's worse . than questionable, it's disgraceful if it's not accompanied by serious . political strategy. Fears: As families gathered for funerals across the city today, it was still unclear what the political reverberations of the attack might be . Funeral: Afghanistan's Shi'ite community of mostly Hazaras make up about 20 per cent of the nation's 30 million population . Slaughter: The victims were killed as they gathered to honour the death of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, in 680 A.D. 'Had the decision to stop fighting . been accompanied by an effort led by [US Secretary of State Hillary] . Clinton to bring all the regional leaders together and keep them . together until they thrashed out an agreement, had we started a serious . peace process ... then signalling to the people of Afghanistan that our . troops were going to come out of combat wouldn't have been a bad thing. 'But to do it without that is rather . similar to our scuttle from Palestine in 1948 or our scuttle from India . in 1947 - it's tactics without strategy. 'It breaks my heart, because we owe . it to the people of Afghanistan, we owe it to all our servicemen and . women who have fought and died and been wounded in Afghanistan.' Yesterday's IED strike come amid . mourning for 59 people, mainly Shia worshippers, who were killed in twin . bomb attacks in the country on Tuesday. Another simultaneous smaller . explosion in the north of the country killed four people in a holiday . vehicle procession. It marked the first major assault on a Muslim sect . in Afghanistan in recent memory. A man claiming to be from . Lashkar-e-Jhangvi al-Alami, a Pakistan-based splinter group of the . Lashkar-e-Jhangvi terror group that has carried out attacks against . Shiite Muslims in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the Kabul . bombing. Scene: Afghans run from the area just moments after the attack yesterday . A distraught Afghan woman in the aftermath of a suicide bomb attack in Kabul yesterday, which killed 56 and injured more than 160 . The attack on the Shi'ite shrine in . Kabul was unprecedented. As well as the 59 dead a further 160 . worshippers were injured. They had gathered to commemorate the holiday . of Ashoura, which honours the death of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the . Prophet Muhammad, in 680 AD. Mr Karzai said Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Jhangvi had claimed reponsibility for the attack. He added: 'This is the first time in . Afghanistan, on a very important religious day, they have acted. Without . doubt it is hostile to Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan, and . Islam.' Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is one of . Pakistan's most violent anti-Shi'ite groups and part of an Al . Qaeda-linked nexus of militants. It has also forged strong ties with . militant groups operating in the tribal areas on the Afghan border. The group emerged as a sectarian . force in the 1990s, targeting minority Shi'ite Muslims, but graduated to . more audacious attacks, like the truck bombing of Islamabad's Marriott . Hotel in 2008 in which 55 people were killed. As families gathered for funerals . across the city, it was still unclear what the political reverberations . of the attack might be. The Taliban condemned the attack, . which was reminiscent of the wave of sectarian bloodshed that shook Iraq . during the height of the war there. Suspicion centred on militant groups based in neighbouring Pakistan, where Sunni attacks on minority Shi'ites are common. A man who claimed to be from . Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Pakistan-based group that has carried out attacks . against Shi'ite Muslims, called various media outlets in Pakistan to . claim responsibility for the bombing in Kabul. The validity of the claim . could not be determined. Until now, the decade-long Afghan war . has largely been spared sectarian violence, where civilians are . targeted simply for their membership of a particular religious group. Yesterday's attack suggests that at . least some militant groups may have changed tactics, taking aim at . ethnic minorities such as the Hazara who are largely Shi'ite and support . the Afghan government and its Western partners. President Karzai joins German President Christian Wulff to meet a group of pupils at Bellevue Palace in Berlin, yesterday. He has cut his Europe trip short to return to Kabul . Afghanistan's Shi'ite community of mostly Hazaras make up about 20 per cent of the nation's 30 million population. Hard-line Sunnis consider Shi'ites non-believers because their customs and traditions differ from the majority sect. President Karzai had been in Germany . for a global conference about the future of security in Afghanistan, . where U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had vowed to keep . supporting the country after most foreign forces leave the country in . 2014. It comes as the nation faces an enduring Taliban-led insurgency and possible financial collapse. 'The United States is prepared to . stand with the Afghan people for the long haul,' U.S. Secretary of State . Hillary Rodham Clinton told the conference, that was overshadowed by . the absence of key regional player, Pakistan. The international community has 'much to lose if the country again becomes a source of terrorism and instability' she added. The conference was focused on the . transfer of security responsibilities from international forces to . Afghan security forces during the next three years, as well as long-term . prospects for international aid and a possible political settlement . with the Taliban to ensure the country's viability beyond 2014. Clinton stressed that in return for . continued support the Afghans must live up to their commitments 'on . taking difficult decisions to embrace reform, lead in their own defense . and strengthen an inclusive democracy rooted in the rule of law'. About 100 countries and international . organisations were represented among the 1,000 conference delegates in . the German city of Bonn, including some 60 foreign ministers. Afghanistan is economically dependent . on foreign aid and spending related to the huge military presence, . currently totalling about 130,000 international troops. The country . seeks assurance that donor nations will help fill the gap after most . forces leave by 2015. Afghanistan estimates it will need . outside contributions of roughly $10billion in 2015, or slightly less . than half the country's annual gross national product, mostly to pay for . its security forces, then slated to number about 350,000. Pakistan is a central player in . regional efforts to improve trade and strengthen its weak economies. But . its boycott has cast a pall over the session, because it points out . that nation's influence in Afghanistan and its ability to play the . spoiler. Pakistan is seen as instrumental to . ending the Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan because of its links to . militant groups and its unwillingness, from the U.S. and NATO . perspective, to drive insurgents from safe havens on its soil where they . regroup and rearm.","Further 19 civilians killed by roadside bomb today .

On Monday at 10 am, California Highway Patrol officers pulled over a vehicle for a traffic stop on the common smuggling route of Interstate 5 at Coalinga.

The Highway Patrol often uses sniffing dogs on the Interstate 5 due to its importance as a drug corridor from Mexico to the US and Canada. Police, however, have noted a new trend. Mexican cartels are increasingly sending drugs north disguised in liquid form. This is the biggest example yet – it is estimated that this 56-pound haul of liquid meth would be worth more than half a million dollars on the streets. Highway patrol spokesman Matt Radke told KFSN: 'At this level of amount, it is going to be distributed all over the place.

He was a skinny bear with only one arm, who could do little more than scavenge for food in order to survive. But the disabled black bear made the crucial mistake of rummaging through bins at the upscale housing community in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. He was a common sight as he ambled along golf courses and the neighbourhood, but finally some residents had enough - particularly when he stole two pies from a kitchen counter - and he was shot dead by the area's Wildlife Management. Now his death in Mountain Air, about 35 miles north of Asheville, has become a flashpoint for the community - with wildlife advocates and some residents outraged at the way the disabled bear was destroyed. Killed: This three-legged bear was killed by management at the Mountain Air development in North Carolina . Residents . in the Mountain Air community first saw the injured bear in November . 2011. At the time, its right front leg was still attached but appeared . to be hanging by a flap of skin. It is unclear how the leg was injured. When . the bear reappeared in the spring, its leg was missing. Construction . workers building a house on the development began feeding the bear . because he was so skinny, said Beverly Hammond, who lives in the . community. For some, . Mountain Air is their second home. So when they returned to the . development for spring and summer, they began complaining about the bear . breaking into homes. After the bear started breaking into . homes looking for food, . some people had enough. Wildlife advocates scrambled to find a sanctuary . for the animal, but time ran out: in August, the bear was shot and . killed by management. Those who were left distraught by what they say was an inhumane response say officials need to find non-lethal ways to handle . so-called nuisance bears. 'When . it comes to nuisance bears, the state's policy is simple: shoot them,' Millie Bowling said. 'And that's just wrong. That needs to change.' Pest: Some residents of the wealthy Mountain Air community complained about the bear's presence . North Carolina has seen a major . resurgence in black bears. A generation ago, their numbers had dwindled . because of hunting and development, and the animals were only found in . the most remote mountains and coastal swamps. Now there are about 15,000 black . bears in North Carolina, with about 5,000 in the western North Carolina. Bear complaints began to increase in the 1990s, primarily in . residential areas of western North Carolina where developers began . building multimillion-dollar homes in gated communities. The number of bear complaints has doubled in the last decade - from 277 in 2001 to 671 in 2011, according to the agency. Many . involve bears who have become too comfortable around humans. They . wander into backyards, looking for food. Most of the blame can be placed . on humans, said Bill Lea, a nature photographer and naturalist who . tried to find a sanctuary for the three-legged bear. If . people do not lock up garbage cans, bears will sift through the trash. If people leave food in bird feeders, bears will find it. 'Bears . that have learned to get food from people - either direct feeding, or . the garbage and bird feeders... and they subsequently lose their fear of . people,' Lea said. Management sent emails and posted notices advising people to keep their windows and doors closed on the ground level. Some residents ignored the warnings, . Hammond said. By early summer, Hammond and other activists were racing . to find a sanctuary to take the bear. She said she begged for another . day or two, but the community's management refused, and the commission . also offered no help. 'Everyone in our development wanted . the bear to be removed, but most wanted him to be removed alive and . taken to Grandfather Mountain, and not removed from our development dead . in the back of a pickup truck,' she said. 'It was just devastating.' This is the latest controversy . surrounding the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. Wildlife . advocates were upset last year when state biologists killed nine penned . deer on a homeowner's property in Randolph County. The commission said the deer were . killed because they had to be tested for a fatal disease called chronic . wasting, which cannot be done on live animals. But the owner, Wayne . Kindley, and supporters said they were outraged. Wildlife . and environmental groups are also angry that the commission allowed . overnight hunting of coyotes throughout North Carolina this year, . including in the area inhabited by the only wild population of red . wolves, one of the world's most endangered animals. The groups opposed . the rule because red wolves resemble coyotes and are hard to tell apart . even during the day. David . Cobb, chief of the agency's Division of Wildlife Management, said the . Mountain Air community decided to kill the three-legged bear. 'This was . an animal that had caused damage to property multiple times, and the . property owners decided they were going to address that issue. And they . did,' he said. Complaint: Management at the community said they had no other way to deal with the bear . But wildlife advocates say the state . did not do enough to help them relocate the bear. 'The idea of shooting . bears should be an absolute last resort,' said Leslie Hayhurst, who . lives on Beach Mountain and runs the Genesis Animal Sanctuary. Some states - mostly in the West - . capture and relocate nuisance bears to remote wildlife settings. The . Wyoming Game and Fish Department routinely relocates and removes black . and grizzly bears as part of normal department operations. But in many . states, there is no place remote enough to relocate them. And the bears . seldom stay where they are released and may return to where they were . caught. In North . Carolina, the agency can relocate a bear but it is done on a . case-by-case basis, and it usually only involves orphan cubs, Cobb said. 'There . are very few places you can put a bear that won't be in somebody's . backyard,' said Bradley Howard, the agency's private lands program . coordinator.

If a weekend in Las Vegas isn’t wild enough for Southern Californians, a Nevada entrepreneur is about to add five more hours of party to either end. Las Vegas Railway Express is one step . closer to bringing to life the X Train, a luxurious 'party train' complete with big screen TVs, recliners and two ultra lounges after striking an agreement with Union . Pacific Railroad last week. 'The whole idea is when you get on a train, you feel like you’re in Las Vegas,' said Michael Barron, president and CEO of the $100 million venture that hopes to launch its maiden voyage on New Year’s Eve 2013. 'It’s essentially a nightclub on wheels.' Scroll down for videos . More to come: An artist's sketch shows the planned interior of one of the X Train's two ultra lounges while transporting guests between Los Angeles and Las Vegas . Fun never stops: The idea is to provide riders with the feeling of already being in Las Vegas, with one lounge seen with slot machines in the far back, as well as game tables in the foreground . Tickets for the adults-only train would . cost $99 each way and include a meal and beverage, with plenty more . alcohol available for purchase. To keep ticket prices low, the company . would try to make money booking Las Vegas hotels and entertainment for . passengers. It would start in Fullerton, Calif. — . already home to an Amtrak station and part of Southern California’s . Metrolink commuter train network — and end in downtown Las Vegas. Tourists can’t get from Southern California to Las Vegas by rail alone, and Barron’s company isn’t the first to try and fix that. The much-talked-about XpressWest project proposes a high-speed train connecting Sin City to the region from which it draws 25 percent of its tourists. All ease: The president and CEO of the $100 million venture says his plan sympathizes with people who spend up to 40 hours gambling in Vegas and then drive seven hours back to Southern California . All aboard! Union Pacific Railroad gave a go ahead for the Las Vegas Railway Express' party train last week, seen here . But it’s a multi-billion-dollar proposal that would require setting new tracks, and it’s often panned as a 'train to nowhere' because the first phase would start in relatively obscure Victorville, about 100 miles outside of Los Angeles. The X Train proposal calls for an Amtrak crew aboard a 576-passenger train that runs at standard speeds on traditional tracks. A conditional agreement with Union Pacific, approved Nov. 16, will allow the company to use a rail line that’s currently limited to freight trains and hasn’t served passengers since Amtrak discontinued its Desert Wind service in 1997 due to low ridership. With initial plans for one trip a day on Thursday, Friday, Sunday, and Monday, Barron believes he can attract tourists weary of the weekend traffic gridlock and perhaps hung over from their weekend revelry. What's included: Riders would be given a meal and beverage with their $99 ticket with plenty more drinks available for purchase, a sports bar's sketch seen here . 'Sunday is horrific,' Barron said of the Interstate 15 corridor that links Las Vegas and its neighbor. 'So now you’ve been up for 40 hours gambling and you have to drive for seven hours — that’s just horrible. But people do it in spite of that!' John Lawson, who was in Las Vegas from Orange County for a few days over Thanksgiving, said he’d like the option of hopping on a train rather than braving bumper-to-bumper traffic on the way back. 'If you party really hard, it sucks driving back,' said Lawson, 28. Vegas visitor Christina Bojorquez, 25, said she’d have to weigh the cost of the train ride against other cheap options, including discounted flights and sharing the expense of driving to Vegas. 'For special occasions it would be good, but not all the time,' she said. Amenities: A possibly more quiet room is seen aboard the train which will take riders on a five-hour trip each way . Tom Skancke, a transportation consultant for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, pointed to the proposed trains and other alternatives to personal cars as options that could entice a new generation of tourists. A new Greyhound Express nonstop bus route between L.A. and Las Vegas launched earlier this month. 'These modes of transportation do appeal to a younger, more eco-friendly traveler,' Skancke said. 'This generation is more interested in passenger rail, transit and high-speed rail than previous generations.' There’s still work to be done on the X Train to get it running by late 2013. The sixteen cars the company has purchased need to be renovated, and a station needs to be completed in downtown Vegas. 'We’re four years and $12 million into it. It’s a lot of infrastructure building,' Barron said. 'This is a simple concept in discussion, but it’s complicated to do.'","Train would cost $99 each way and include a meal and beverage .

While some may say never work with children or animals, photographer Brad Wilson decided to ignore this pearl of wisdom. The snapper wanted to work with something 'a little less predictable' and certainly achieved that, by bringing in hungry wild animals and taking their portrait. Mr Wilson brought in hungry mountain lions, cheetahs and orangutans, who were trained not to attack humans, and using their favourite types of food managed to take their photograph in a studio by rewarding them with snacks. Scroll down for video . Keeping an eye out: An elephant stares into the lense in graphic close up as part of Brad Wilson's collection . Detailed: The close up of this mountain lion shows its beauty in close up . Almost human? This orangutan's face seems almost human as it looks into the camera, while a Siberian tiger lets out a roar under the keen eye of photographer Wilson . He began by calling wildlife sanctuaries and handlers that provide animals for Hollywood movies, he told Petapixel. The photographer based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, said the most difficult part was 'pre-production' of his ambitious idea. He said: 'Trying to find the animals I could bring into the studio, find the right trainers to come with these animals, and even just to find a space that could contain an elephant, contain a giraffe - and that was a big part of it.' Once he had the animals he needed, he signed large insurance policies and liability contracts so, if an animal died during a shoot, Mr Wilson owed $500,000, the website reported.

They are basically trained to not come out on to the set and try to attack you; beyond that, they are really going to do what they want to do.'

Majid Khan, 30, who has been jailed for 16 and a half years after flooding the north-east of England with heroin and cannabis, using his car wash business in Middlesbrough . A drug gang mastermind who used an accomplice behind bars to flood the north-east of England with heroin and cannabis has been jailed for 16-and-a-half years. Majid Khan, 30, used his carwash business in Middlesbrough, Teesside, as a disguise for his multi-million pound plot to distribute drugs. Another man involved in the scheme is already serving a 14-year sentence behind bars. Teesside Crown Court heard how convicted drugsman Imran Bashir helped to orchestrate the team. Bashir, 36, discussed the plan during a prison visit when his wife used her mobile phone to host a conference call with Khan. Although both men spoke English, their conversations - recorded by prison bosses - were mostly in Urdu and contained code. Police only managed to recover drugs worth £300,000 but the court heard how the trade was worth millions. Judge Howard Crowson ruled that . Bashir, from Droylesden, Manchester, will start a seven-year sentence at . the end of the term he is currently serving. Khan's right-hand man, Mohammed Akram, . 25, described by the judge as 'a trusted second in command' received . ten years and four months.

"By . Claire Bates and Jenny Hope . UPDATED: . 21:25 EST, 28 February 2012 . Angry: Ex-gymnast Penny Brown, 51, had her ASR metal-on-metal implant removed in 2011. She said she has endured almost two years of constant pain . Almost 50,000 patients with ‘metal on metal’ hip replacements face increased checks amid fears they may cause serious health problems. The UK’s safety watchdog has increased vigilance on implants suspected of causing serious damage to muscle and bone from metal debris. Friction between two metal plates in the body produces chemical fragments called ions that leak into the blood, triggering inflammation and two to three times the predicted failure rate. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) yesterday issued a new alert to the NHS on a wide range of implants, saying there was a ‘small risk’ they could cause complications in patients. Hip replacements involve a ball, socket and stem. The new alert relates to those whose replacements have a ball with a diameter of 36mm or more. Around 65,000 people in the UK have received metal on metal hip implants since 2003, of whom 49,000 are affected by yesterday’s guidance because they have these ‘large-head’ implants. They have been told they should have annual tests on blood ion levels while those with symptoms will also need annual MRI scans. Guidance published in 2010 said patients with large-head metal on metal implants should have annual checks for the first five years, but these have now been extended to the lifetime of the implant. Doctors will be told to consider removing and replacing the implant if the MRI scans come back abnormal or they are concerned about rising ion levels in the blood. Among those needing greater supervision are 10,000 people with DePuy ASR implants or resurfacing devices, which were recalled in 2010. Some of those affected will need second hip replacements but excessive wear on the hip joint can make such surgery more difficult. The MHRA has received 370 ‘adverse incident’ reports involving metal on metal implants, including soft tissue damage, of which 242 relate to large-head implants. Risk: Metal hip replacements by DePuy have already been recalled by hospitals for tests . Metal hips: Concerns are growing that small particles of metal in these devices could poison patients . According to the MHRA, metal on metal implants are made by the following manufacturers: Biomet, Smith & Nephew, Finsbury, Stryker, Zimmer, DePuy, Corin, Joint Replacement Instrumentation Ltd, Implacast GmbH and Wright Medical UK Ltd. Solicitors are coordinating a group claim for ‘crippling pain’ and serious damage against DePuy Orthopaedics. They claimed the MHRA action was ‘too late’ after figures showed metal on metal implants fail sooner than other devices such as those made of ceramic – with one in eight needing to be refitted within seven years and women being particularly badly affected. Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action against Medical Accidents, said it was ‘scandalous that tens of thousands of patients have been put needlessly at risk by the failure by manufacturers and regulators to act quickly’. By TAMARA COHEN . Traditional . hip replacements – carried out since the 1950s – used a metal ball and a . plastic socket. In the 1990s, however, metal on metal types became . popular. In these . products both the femoral ball, which sits on top of the leg, and the . acetabular socket it fits into which is attached to the hip, are made of . metal. It was thought these could cope with more wear and tear. Around 40,000 have them and they are still being fitted. In . 2010, regulators became worried about the number of patients needing . their operations redone because their muscle tissue had been damaged by . the metal on metal hips. It . turned out tiny metal particles were getting into the blood, poisoning . it and leaving patients in pain and with lasting damage to tissue. If . the problem is not identified early enough, further operations can be . more difficult. The . Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ordered two types . of hip implant manufactured by DePuy to be taken off the market. Surgeons . say their failure rate could be 50 per cent after just six years for . full hip replacements, far higher than previously thought. Other metal . on metal implants – of which the most popular is the DePuy Pinnacle – . may also have higher than average failure rates, but there is not enough . evidence yet to be sure. If . you have a DePuy ASR or ASR XL implant or do not know whether you do, . you are advised to see your doctor and ask for a blood test to check the . metal level, even if you are not experiencing any pain. If . you have another brand of metal on metal implant you are advised not to . panic, but to have an annual check-up for five years. There is a . website for ASR patients at asrrecall.depuy.com. DePuy has a helpline on 0800 2794865. The . MHRA has issued a new alert for everyone with a metal on metal . implant  because surgeons fear the devices are more dangerous than had . been appreciated. It says most patients should have regular MRI scans to monitor the hip. It can be viewed at mhra.gov.uk . Dr Susanne Ludgate, the MHRA’s clinical director of devices, said problems surfaced in 2008 after reports from some surgeons that patients were suffering swelling around their hip. She said the two-year delay before advice was issued on DePuy implants was because of ‘very varied reports from surgeons’ but they had performed worse than others. A study by the British Medical Journal in . partnership with the BBC, also revealed that some companies changed the . design of the metal hips - making the head of the joint larger - without . performing safety trials first. Tens of thousands of UK patients may . have been exposed to dangerously high levels of toxic metals from . failing hip implants, according to the investigation published in the BMJ. This is despite the risks being known for decades. Hip implants, like breast implants did not have to pass any clinical trials before they were put into patients. However, . the report reveals that cobalt and chromium ions can seep into the . tissues of patients with 'metal on metal' hip implants, causing local . reactions that destroy muscle and bone, and leaving some patients with . long term disability. The BMJ said despite concerns being raised, UK and U.S regulators failed to warn doctors and patients of the potential dangers. They . said evidence was mounting about high metal concentrations in patients . with articular surface replacement (ASR) hips as early as 2006. But it . was another four years until the UK regulator, the MHRA, issued an . official safety alert and the ASR hip was recalled from the market. Instead, it said the MHRA appointed a . committee that included company representatives and several consultants . to decide the fate of metal on metal hips. As a result, the regulator concluded patients should be told about the risks, but no alert was issued to surgeons or patients. During . this time, implant rates peaked. In England and Wales over 20,000 large . diameter metal on metal hips were implanted thereafter, while in the . US, metal on metal hips are still being marketed to orthopaedic . surgeons. Nick Freemantle, Professor . of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at University College London . says: 'We shouldn’t be in this position where we don’t know and there’s . so much uncertainty. The stability of a compound should have been . ascertained before it was used widely in people. As yet, we don’t know . the consequences of this.' Dr . Fiona Godlee, BMJ Editor in Chief says: 'Hip replacements are one of . the great successes of modern medicine. But a combination of inadequate . regulation and untrammelled commercialism has caused actual and . potential harm for large numbers of patients around the world. 'They should have known about the risks, as the manufacturers and regulators did, but they were not told. 'No . pre-market system can ensure all devices are safe, but they can . certainly make it more likely,' add Dr Carl Heneghan and colleagues in . an accompanying article. 'Creating . an independent system for post-marketing analysis for implantable . medical devices that is robust and increasing international coordination . around device alerts and withdrawals should go some way to sorting out . the current mess.'","MHRA announces most patients with metal-on-metal hips should have regular MRI scans .

A natural gas explosion that leveled a strip club and injured 18 people was caught on camera. Scores Gentleman's Club was flattened and a day . care center heavily damaged in the massive blast on Friday night in . Springfield, Massachusetts. It left a large hole in the ground where the multistory, brick building once stood and scattered debris over several blocks. Scroll down for videos . Blast: A natural gas explosion tore through a strip club in Springfield, Massachusetts on Friday . Danger: Scores Gentleman's Club exploded in New England and left 18 injured . The blast was caused by human error, according to fire marshal Stephen D Coan, after a gas worker accidentally punctured a pipe. Officials already had evacuated part of the entertainment district after responding to a gas leak and odor reported about an hour before the explosion. Workers venting a gas leak got indications that the building was about to explode and they ducked for cover behind a utility truck – along with firefighters and police officers – just before the blast, said Mark McDonald, president of the New England Gas Workers Association. Most of the injured were in that group, and the truck that saved their lives was essentially demolished, he said. 'It really is a miracle and it's an example of our public safety officials, each and every day, putting themselves in harm's way, taking what could have been considered a very routine call of an odor of gas, but they took the proper precautions,' State Fire Marshal Stephen Coan said. 'And thanks to God that they did.' Officials also marveled how the 5.30pm blast occurred when a day care center next door was closed. The center's building was heavily damaged. Miracle: No one died in the massive blast after gas workers fled the scene . Blown out: More than 40 buildings were damaged when a gas explosion levelled a gentlemen's club and blew out windows for blocks . Lt. Governor Tim Murray and Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno were attending a tree-lighting ceremony when the explosion occurred. Sarno said some people mistakenly thought the boom was part of the holiday event. The explosion blew out windows in a three-block radius, leaving at least three buildings irreparably damaged and causing emergency workers to evacuate a six-story apartment building that was buckling, police said. Pieces of broken glass littered streets and sidewalks. It was unclear how many residents had been evacuated. A shelter was set up at a school, but city officials said no one stayed there overnight. Omar Fermin, manager of the Punta Cana Restaurant two blocks from the explosion site, found the floor-to-ceiling windows blasted out when he came to check on the property Saturday morning. 'It looks like an earthquake hit,' said Fermin, a native of the Dominican Republic. 'I've never seen anything like it.' He said he was waiting for someone to come and assess the damage. He worried the restaurant would remain closed for weeks while the owner seeks to replace the massive custom-made windows. Suspicious report: Workers surveyed the damage the morning after following a report of a strong gas odour an hour before the building exploded . Guarding: Officers stand at a perimeter around where a gas explosion leveled a strip club in Springfield and injured 18 people . Authorities cordoned off the center of the explosion Saturday as building inspectors worked to identify unsafe structures. Anxious residents gathered at the perimeter, waiting for permission to visit their buildings. Preliminary reports show the blast damaged 42 buildings housing 115 residential units, said Thomas Walsh, spokesman for the mayor. Three buildings were immediately condemned, and 24 others require additional inspections by structural engineers to determine whether they are safe, Walsh said. Dogs trapped in abandoned buildings barked loudly on Saturday as building inspectors fanned out across the area. One inspector said he wished he could get a ladder and permission to retrieve a dog that was barking in the upper floor of one building sealed off from residents. Mementos: A woman's high-heeled shoe is seen among the rubble where Score's Gentleman's Club use to be . Small businesses: Robert Spano, left, and Alan Hugley shovel broken glass outside of Punta cana Restaurant & Bar, one of many businesses feared by their owners and managers of staying closed for too long . Authorities are opening an animal shelter for pets affected by the explosion, Walsh said. Coan, the fire marshal, said his office is investigating the cause of the blast and its possible origin. The state's Department of Public Utilities was also investigating. Sheila Doiron, a spokeswoman for Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, said the company will continue to monitor for any potential leaks within several blocks of the blast site. So far, she said, the company hadn't yet found any measurable readings. The utility will keep at least 30 workers at the scene, along with a so-called sniffing car mounted with sophisticated gadgets capable of detecting low levels of gas leaks, Walsh said. Doiron said the company also didn't find in its records any gas odor calls to the area where the strip club was located. Authorities also deployed police officers throughout the area to prevent looting, Walsh said. The victims were taken to two hospitals in the city. Those injured were nine firefighters, two police officers, four Columbia Gas workers, two civilians and another city employee. Springfield, which is 90 miles west of Boston and has about 150,000 residents, is the largest city in western Massachusetts. The city has been rebuilding from damage caused by a tornado in June 2011.

A mother who fell into a coma after colouring her hair at home has died in hospital. Julie McCabe had been on a life- support machine following a ­suspected allergic reaction to L’Oreal Preference hair dye in October last year. The 38-year-old estate agent collapsed with breathing difficulties and suffered heart failure and brain damage. Doctors had given her only an eight per cent chance of survival. She never recovered and died on Thursday. Her family blamed paraphenylenediamine (PPD) - a chemical found in hair dyes - for her extreme reaction. They were too upset to speak last night but a friend said 'It is an absolute tragedy. They are devastated.' There has been no definitive link . made with the L’Oreal product but doctors caring for Mrs McCabe asked . for the kit and gloves she used so they can carry out tests. The costmetics giant offered to assist the medical staff with any information and launched an investigation. Mrs McCabe’s husband Russell, 45, and . children Luke, 21, and Abigail, 16, had kept a bedside vigil at Airedale Hospital in Keighley, West Yorkshire, where she was given round-the-clock care. Mrs McCabe dyed her hair every six weeks but had never suffered a reaction before. Airedale hospital: The family kept a vigil at Julie's bedside where she had 24-hour care following her collapse . Doctors caring for Mrs McCabe, an estate agent, have asked for the L'Oreal hair dye kit and gloves she used . On the day of the tragedy she had been rinsing the dye off after the recommended 20 minutes when she began struggling for breath . Her father Keith Miller, 63, said: 'She finished dyeing her hair and told her husband, ""I don’t feel well, I can’t breathe"". He rushed her to hospital and her heart stopped beating on the way.' Her family have called for PPD to be banned from home dye kits. Mr Miller said: ‘I promise for the sake of my daughter and other women to get this chemical outlawed in Britain. 'I don’t want this happening to anybody else’s daughter or wife.’ Mrs McCabe’s mother Brenda Miller, 60, said: ‘PPD builds up in your system over time and this is what has caused a reaction in Julie.' The family have been in contact . with a hair and scalp specialist who claims that an allergy to hair dye . increases as a result of cumulative exposure to PPD. Consultant trichologist Brian Plunkett, who has spent more than a decade researching hair dye allergy, told the Sunday Express: 'This is a tragedy and we have spoken with the family on many occasions over the last very difficult year. 'Allergy to hair dye can happen at any time and skin testing before every colour is essential. Manufacturers must do more to raise awareness and improve protocols of testing.' A U.S. study has linked exposure to PPD to increased rates of bladder cancer. Under EU rules, in Britain it can constitute six per cent of a hair dye. It is a colourless compound but it achieves a rich colour when it reacts with oxygen contained in ingredients in hair dye, such as hydrogen peroxide. The chemical is used in many permanent hair dyes because it binds firmly to the hair and does not wash out. Allergy to it is rare, affecting one in 250,000 people, and in most cases the effect is a mild rash. But reactions can be severe, causing serious skin irritations or even anaphylaxis. An allergic reaction does not necessarily start the first time a product is used. It can happen after several uses. Dye users are told to do a ‘patch test’, applying a small amount of it to their skin 48 hours before treatment every time they use it.","Julie McCabe had been given only an 8% chance of surviving .

Rock carvings held sacred to an American Indian tribe in California's Sierra Nevada for thousands of years have fallen prey to modern thieves armed with power saws. At least four petroglyphs - some 2 feet wide and located 15 feet above the ground - were hacked from lava cliffs in the Eastern Sierra. Visitors to the area, known as Volcanic Tableland, discovered the theft and reported it to the federal Bureau of Land Management on October 31. Sacred: Rock carvings that graced an American Indian site in California's Sierra Nevada for thousands of years have fallen victim to thieves armed with power saws . Ancient writings: Raymond Andrews, the tribal historic preservation officer of the Bishop Paiute Tribe visits area that hosts petroglyphs etched more than 3,000 years ago into the volcanic cliff faces . 'This was the worst act of vandalism ever seen' on the 750,000 acres of public land administered by the BLM field office in Bishop, BLM archaeologist Greg Haverstock told the Los Angeles Times. The thieves must have used ladders, electric generators and power saws. In addition to the four carvings that were stolen, one was defaced with deep saw cuts on three sides, and another was removed but apparently broke during the theft and was left propped against a boulder near a visitor parking lot. More than 3,500 years ago, Native Americans carved pictures of hunters, deer and other animals, and geometric and other designs into a half-mile-long volcanic escarpment. Theft: The drawings have apparently been taken by bold thieves armed with ladders, power saws and other equipment . The images adorn hundreds of lava boulders.

A first-time felony conviction for damaging or removing petroglyphs can carry a one-year prison sentence and a $20,000 fine.

"By . Adam Shergold . PUBLISHED: . 08:30 EST, 20 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:19 EST, 21 November 2012 . A Christian girl accused of blasphemy over the burning of the Koran has been acquitted by a Pakistani court, her lawyer said. Rimsha Masih, 11, faced the death penalty after being arrested in Islamabad in August when her neighbour Mohammed Khalid Chishti, a Muslim cleric, accused her of desecrating the holy book. The cleric was later accused of 'framing' Masih by fabricating evidence in a case that went to the highest levels of the Pakistani government and sparked international outrage at the country's strict blasphemy laws. Acquitted: Christian Rimsha Masih, 11 (pictured left), had been accused of burning page of the Koran by her Muslim cleric neighbour Mohammed Khalid Chishti (right), who now faces charges of fabricating evidence . Attorney Abdul Hameed said a court in Islamabad dismissed all the charges against Masih on Tuesday, concluding they were based on heresy and incriminated material that was planted in the girl's possession. 'I am happy that the poor girl's ordeal is now over,' Hameed said. Masih was released on bail in September but was flown by helicopter to an unknown location. There were fears Masih and other Christians in her neighbourhood could be in danger if she remained there. In Pakistan, the mere allegation of causing offence to Islam can mean death, with some killed even if they are found innocent by the courts. Flight to safety: After being released from an Islamabad prison in September, Masih (face covered) was forced to flee by helicopter to a safe location . Extraordinary: Masih and her family were forced to move away from their majority Muslim neighbourhood in Islamabad after the incident . However, this was a rare occasion when senior Islamic clerics intervened to oppose the charges levelled at her. Sympathy for the girl has been heightened by unsubstantiated claims that she is mentally impaired and has Down's Syndrome. She was accused of carrying charred pages from the Koran near her house in a poor neighbourhood on the outskirts of Islamabad. In an extraordinary development, however, three officers from the local mosque accused Chishti of planting the pages among the charred refuse Masih had been carrying to strengthen the case against her. Tahir Naveed Chaudhry, another of the girl's lawyers, said the testimony of a local police officer, who told a court there was no evidence against her, had proved crucial in securing her acquittal. Protest: Chishti is restrained by police after trying to shout slogans after a court appearance. The cleric is accused of 'framing' the 11-year-old girl . The officer had appeared to 'arrest' Masih in mid-August to protect her from protests by the majority Muslim community in the Mehrabad district. Chaudhry went on to demand changes to Pakistan's religious laws, which were strengthened during the hardline conservative rule of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in the 1980s. 'It is very difficult to change these laws in Pakistan,' he said. 'But this judgement will set a precedent so that other cases can be properly investigated and pursued.' Concerns remains over the safety of Masih, who is unlikely to return to Mehrabad because of continuing support among many for Chishti. 'While I'm thrilled to hear the charges have been quashed, my foremost concern at the moment is her safety,' said Tahira Abdullah, a rights activist in Islamabad. 'Others have been acquitted before but they have not lived to tell the tale.' Many Christians moved out of the area during protests in the weeks after her arrest.","Rimsha Masih, 11, faced the death penalty under strict blasphemy rules .

"By . Peter Campbell and Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 13:43 EST, 20 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:31 EST, 21 November 2012 . The UK's most revered technology entrepreneur, known as 'Britain's Bill Gates', has denied masterminding a £3billion accounting cover-up as a bitter row with his former bosses at Hewlett Packard intensified today. Dr Mike Lynch made more than £500million by selling his home-grown software firm Autonomy last year in a £7.1billion deal but now the American company has wiped £5.5billion ($8.8bn) off its value. HP boss Meg Whitman blames ‘accounting improprieties’ by 'certain former Autonomy employees' for the £3billion loss, accusing Lynch and others of 'lying' to them by inflating revenues and profit margins for at least two years before the deal was struck. But Dr Lynch denies the claims and says that the 300 auditors HP had poring over their books would have picked up any problems. Tonight he ruled out legal action against those making the claims and pointed the finger at HP. Row: British technology guru Dr Mike Lynch (left) denies his company orchestrated a £3bn accounting cover-up when he sold his Autonomy company to Meg Whitman's (right) Hewlett Packard last year . Appearing on Sky News, he told Jeff Randall: 'HP was once a great company. If that business can get back to its core and fix itself then I think Autonomy will have a good future. HP needs to stop trying to deflect attention away from itself.' After the write-off, HP's shares dropped to $11 yesterday - down 12 per cent - the lowest level for HP in a decade. Dr Lynch, 47, who is a non-executive director of the BBC and adviser to David Cameron, could now face a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and today said he was furious about the claims levelled at him and rejected them all. He lives in a £6millon Grade II-listed Georgian manor house in Suffolk, with eight bedrooms and five bathrooms, and sits in 70 acres of grounds with private woodland, paddocks, a swimming pool, four cottages and a lodge. Home: Mike Lynch owns the £6million Grade II listed Loudham Hall in Suffolk . Luxurious: The handsome house has eight bedrooms and five bathrooms . Grand: The mansion has 70 acres of grounds with private woodland, paddocks, a swimming pool, four cottages and a lodge. 'The figures are just mad. Things would have to have gone pretty badly wrong to justify writing $8.8bn,' Dr Lynch said in his rebuttal. 'It . is utterly untrue. We reject this as utterly untrue. Everything we did . we gave correctly to the auditors and was correctly noted by the . auditors. 'I don't . understand how you can write-down this amount and say somehow this was . all caused by something you didn't notice when you did due diligence . with 300 people. It would have been kind of a big elephant to miss.' According to HP, evidence of an accounting cover-up was . apparently revealed to them by a former Autonomy executive whistleblower within the last . six months. It has already been passed to financial prosecutors on both . sides of the Atlantic. Lynch has 'flatly rejected' the accusations and said he was 'shocked' but confident he would be absolved of any misdeeds . He left HP after Autonomy missed budget forecasts and says that Autonomy has been mismanaged since his exit. Tech giant: Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto in California, has taken a £5.5billion hit after accusing staff at Autonomy - a British company it purchased last year - of cooking the books to increase its company value . Dr Lynch is on the BBC's executive board and said today that it had spoken to him and would not ask him to resign as a non executive director. A spokesman told MailOnline: 'The BBC has spoken to Dr Mike Lynch regarding the allegations made against his company in the media.  We note that the company has denied the allegations. 'We have not asked Dr Lynch to step down from his role as a BBC Non-Executive Director. We will continue to monitor the situation as it develops and will take any further action should it become necessary.' HP also said it would also . ‘aggressively pursue’ individual Autonomy executives to recoup financial . damages for its shareholders. The allegations come six months after . Dr Lynch walked away from the business he founded after he fell out with . management, insiders say. New Yorker Meg Whitman is arguably . America's most successful businesswoman with a CV littered with jobs . at some of the world's biggest companies. The . mother-of-two is the fourth wealthiest woman in California with a net . worth of $1.3billion, mainly built up while serving as eBay’s chief executive . from 1998 to 2008. In that . time she started with 30 employees and boosted it to 15,000 staff . within a decade, drawing in an incredible $8bn in annual revenues. Previously . she had worked at giants like Walt Disney, DreamWorks, Procter & . Gamble and Hasbro before joining Hewlett Packard on an annual salary of . $1 - but also around $16million of stock options and other perks . including a company plane. She . also attempted a political career and in 2010 shattered the record for . the biggest spending candidate in any U.S. election in history. She . splashed out a staggering $119 million of her own money in her failed . bid to succeed Arnold Schwarzenegger as California’s next Republican . governor. By shelling out . another $15 million from her hi-tech fortune , she surpassed the $109 . million spent by New York mayor Michael Bloomberg on his 2009 . re-election campaign. Her track-record in business is hallmarked with her reputation for her determination in driving companies to success. When he started a . software company in his garage in 1996, Mike Lynch could not have dreamt . he would one day sell it for more than £7billion. Those who knew . him well say that Lynch is intelligent driven, and ambitious, and . predicted the sale of Autonomy, which netted him just over half a . billion pounds, would not be the last that we would hear of Dr Lynch. Little . were they to know that he would reappear as he did yesterday, with the . allegations levelled by Hewlett Packard throwing him back into the . spotlight. After he was born in County Tipperary in Ireland in . 1965 to a fireman and a nurse, Lynch’s family moved to Chelmsford, Essex . while he was still a child. There Mike showed early signs of his fierce intelligence, and won a scholarship to the nearby private school Bancroft’s. He . went on to study physics, maths and biochemistry at Christ’s College, . Cambridge, before opting to spend the next years of his life in . academia. It was the miracle growth of Autonomy that earned him the title ‘Britain’s Bill Gates’. He was given an OBE in 1996 and a year later was appointed to the BBC executive committee as a non-executive director. He . lives in a Grade II listed Georgian manor house in Suffolk, although it . is not known whether he has a family at the massive home.The £6m estate has 70 acres of grounds and is surrounded by private woodland. Autonomy rose from humble beginnings . in 1996 to become a darling of the City and a member of the FTSE 100 . index of the UK’s biggest companies. It was seen as a great success story . of British innovation, providing computer programs that processed large . amounts of data to thousands of small businesses. Software giant Oracle says it had the chance to buy Autonomy but decided it was incredibly over-priced, its founder Larry Ellison has said. The world's sixth richest man said Mike Lynch approached him with a deal but he balked at the proposed $6bn value. 'We looked at the price and thought it was absurdly high,' he said a month after HP did the deal. It then turned into a war of words between him and Dr Lynch, who said: 'If some bank happened to come with us on a list, that is nothing to do with us.” But Oracle then declared it was 'another whopper from Autonomy CEO Mike Lynch.' The statement went on: 'Either Lynch has a very poor memory or he’s lying. 'Some bank did not just happen to come to Oracle with Autonomy ""on a list."" The truth is that Mr. Lynch came to Oracle, along with his investment banker.' To further embarrass Lynch, Oracle then released a slides detailing Autonomy’s financial health they had received. Ten years after founding the firm, . Irish-born and Cambridge-educated Dr Lynch was awarded an OBE. HP’s chief executive Meg Whitman, was not in charge when it bought Autonomy. Former HP boss Leo Apotheker led the acquisition of Autonomy and in his two years in charge the company's share valuedropped by 45 per cent, with a big dip when they completed the deal. She issued a strongly worded . statement about the affair. She alleged that ‘some former members . of Autonomy’s management team used accounting improprieties, . misrepresentations and disclosure failures to inflate the underlying . financial metrics of the company, prior to Autonomy’s acquisition by . HP’. She added: ‘These efforts appear to . have been a wilful effort to mislead investors and potential buyers, and . severely impacted HP management’s ability to fairly value Autonomy at . the time of the deal.’ Miss Whitman has passed details of the . financial cover-ups to the UK’s Serious Fraud Office and its US . equivalent, the Securities and Exchanges Commission, ‘for civil and . criminal investigation’. Although she refused to name the . executives who were likely to be questioned, she said ‘a senior member . of Autonomy’s leadership team came forward [with the details] following . the departure of Mike Lynch’. It is thought to be unlikely that any financial cover-up would occur without the knowledge of Dr Lynch. A PR company acting for Dr Lynch . yesterday issued a statement saying he was ‘shocked to see this . statement today, and flatly rejects these allegations, which are false’. It added: ‘HP’s senior management has also been closely involved with running Autonomy for the past year. ‘It took ten years to build Autonomy’s . industry-leading technology and it is sad to see how it has been . mismanaged since its acquisition by HP.’ The SFO refused to comment on whether it would launch an investigation.

Controversial: A cartoon aired on Channel 4 has sparked anger after mocking Princess Diana and Jade Goody . Complaints: The ghosts of both women made appearances in Full English - with one scene showing the pair attempt to strangle each other in a row over who was the real 'People's Princess' The cartoon, shown at 10.50pm on Monday night, shows two characters holding a seance for a 'great woman'. Suddenly Jade, who died of cervical cancer in 2009, appears as a foul-mouthed ghost. Later in the show, the ghost of Princess Diana arrives. But her opening remarks will no doubt be found offensive by many people. In reference to the Paris crash in 1997 which killed Princess Diana, the cartoon character says: 'Sorry I'm late everyone. Had some car trouble, the traffic was absolute murder.' Diana is then labelled a 'bulimic slut'  by Jade, in reference to her eating disorder. The ghost of Diana then calls Jade 'baldy' before the pair begin to fight by grabbing each other around the throat. The racism row involving Jade and Shilpa Shetty from Celebrity Big Brother in 2007 is also brought up in the cartoon.

At one point, Jade's character says: 'I call someone a poppadom and everybody hated me, then I got cancer and everyone loved me again.' The cartoon clearly infuriated some viewers, with some taking to Twitter to vent their anger. Adam B tweeted: 'I do not really like . this Full English show. It is not Family Guy and it just did a cancer gag on Jade Goody. It wasn't in good taste.' Sam Jones said: 'Quite disgusted the way Channel 4's Full English took the p**s out of the late Jade Goody.' Full English is a new animated sitcom based around the Johnson family. The controversial episode was only the second to be shown. Complaints: Shortly afterwards, Princess Diana's ghost appears before she and Jade fight . Channel 4 describes it as 'unashamedly rude and silly, with identifiable characters and hilarious stories.' A C4 spokesperson said: 'Full English is a late night animated sitcom that takes a satirical swipe at popular culture, celebrities and every other aspect of modern British life. 'Appropriate warnings flagged that the show contained humour of an adult nature and the content was within viewers expectations of those tuning in to a comedy at this time.' A spokesman for Ofcom confirmed it had received a number of complaints about the show. He said: 'I can confirm we have received a number of complaints. We are assessing them at the moment.'

A frantic young mother ran screaming from from her parent's house screaming 'My baby, my baby' after her week old son was killed by the family's pet terrier. Eight-day-old Harry Harper is understood to have suffered a crushed skull after being bitten just once by the Jack Russell-cross. The animal has since been destroyed. Yesterday it was unclear which family members were present at the time of the incident, which is said to have taken place in the living room of the family's home in Ketley, Shropshire. Eight day old Harry Harper died after being bitten by a Jack Russell dog while staying at his grandparents' house in Ketley, Shropshire . Grandad Gordon Bell with daughter Mikayla and grandson Harry who died after being bitten yesterday . A police car sits outside the house in Ketley, where Harry Harper was bitten by a dog yesterday morning. He later died in hospital . Neighbours said the child’s distraught mother, . Mikayla Bell, ran out of the house screaming and pleaded with paramedics to save her newborn son. Baby Harry was rushed to hospital but died of his injuries soon after. The pet, named as PJ by residents, was . one of two dogs kept at the three-bedroom semi where Miss Bell lived . with her own parents and younger siblings. Just over a fortnight before giving . birth, Miss Bell, 19, had tweeted how the dog had ripped the eye off one . of the family’s soft toys. Police yesterday said Harry’s death . appeared to be a ‘tragic accident’. Officers are examining the . possibility that the dog may have attacked the infant after becoming . jealous at his introduction to what the animal considered to be its . territory. Police believe that Harry Harper, pictured, died as a result of the single dog bite, but are awaiting results of a formal post mortem . Mikayla posted these pictures of a Jack Russell-type dog on Twitter. However, it is not clear whether this is the dog that attacked her baby . Jack Russell breeders and an animal . behaviour expert agreed the dogs could be both possessive of their . existing family unit and jealous of new additions to the family. Harry’s mother and father, Tom Harper, 19, were being comforted by their parents and police family liaison officers. One neighbour said at least one of the two dogs kept by the family was ‘very vicious’. Nigel Pitchford yesterday said Miss Bell had brought her first child home from hospital only a few days before the tragedy. Mr Pitchford, 71, said: ‘It’s very sad news – the whole street is shocked to hear what has happened. ‘The dog is one of two kept at the house  as family pets. ‘I often saw Mikayla’s younger twin sisters walking them in the evenings. ‘I know one of the dogs is very . vicious. I tried to post a Christmas card through  the letter box last . year and it went for my hand as I posted it through. It was only small . but a vicious little thing.’ New mother Mikayla Sonya, pictured left, posted this picture of her feeding baby Harry, right, on her Twitter feed . Miss Bell lives at the semi-detached . property with parents Gordon, 42, and Teresa, 40, . a shop worker, and three of her siblings. Her brother Jamie, a . 24-year-old carpet fitter, lives around the corner. It is unclear whether Mr Harper, a . trainee electrician who lives in nearby Shifnal with his parents Andrea . and Neville, was still in a relationship with Miss Bell, a part-time . model who is one of six children. She gave birth to 7lb Harry on November 12 and posted pictures of her new baby on Twitter, describing the infant as ‘my life’. Heartbreakingly, just one day before . her son was killed, the teenager wrote: ‘Not gonna lie this little boy . gets far too many kisses.’ The teenager’s profile on the social . networking site also contained two pictures of a terrier-type dog . captioned ‘my doggy’, posted within the last six months. Mrs Bell was so delighted at becoming a . grandmother that the day after Harry was born she told a friend she . couldn’t ‘keep my hands off him’. The family of Harry told yesterday how . they had ‘no words’ to describe the pain they were experiencing after . the loss of the tot. In a statement issued through West . Mercia Police, they said: ‘We are absolutely devastated by Harry’s death . and have no words to describe the loss we have suffered. ‘At the present time we have no wish . to speak publicly about yesterday’s events and would ask that we are . left in peace to grieve and begin to deal with our loss.’ Mrs Harper, a nursery nurse, later described the family as being ‘numb’ with grief. Baby Harry's grandmother Teresa and grandfather Gordon . Angela McKenzie, a Jack Russell . breeder from Carlisle, said the breed could become possessive of toys, . family members or other pets in their environment. ‘They may happily live with a cat, but go after other cats in the neighbourhood, the same with children,’ she said. Police and ambulance crews were called to the scene of the tragedy just after 8am on Tuesday. Harry was taken to The Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, Shropshire, but was pronounced dead shortly after being admitted. A post-mortem examination to establish the exact cause of death will take place today. Detective Chief Inspector Neil . Jamieson, of West Mercia Police, said: ‘Our investigation is ongoing but . it appears that the baby died as a result of a dog bite.’ Victim: In April, five-year-old Haley Turner was attacked by a Jack Russell terrier after reaching down to stroke the pet in a neighbour's garden in Otley, West Yorkshire . By Liz Hull . Although small, Jack Russell terriers are known for their feisty, tough nature. Principally bred to hunt foxes, rabbits and rats, the breed is among the most popular in the UK and is known for being ‘a big dog in a small dog’s body’. Dr Roger Mugford, an animal behaviourist and expert on dangerous dogs, said: ‘If Jack Russells were scaled up to labrador size they would be on the dangerous dogs list. They are very tough dogs. They can be very sweet, very lively and very playful, but they are also strong and powerful for their size. ‘They are bred to catch rabbits and rodents so they are reactive, terribly impulsive and incredibly fast. Like any dogs Jack Russells can form strong attachments, be quite possessive of their owners and jealous when a new baby is introduced. ‘However, an incident like this is very rare. The attachment a dog has to the mother of the child usually extends to the baby and, generally, dogs are very good caretakers and are protective of babies. Something like this is very out of character. ‘Most dog attacks on children also occur on toddlers because they interact with the dog. In this case an eight-day-old baby was obviously passive and, even if he was crying, should not have posed a threat to the dog. We don’t know the circumstances of this tragedy, but if the parents were present there is a chance the dog lunged and moved so fast they could do nothing about it. No dog of any breed should be left around children unsupervised.’ Brutal: Three-month-old Jaden Mack was attacked by a Staffordshire bull terrier and a Jack Russell after his parents left him with his grandmother in South Wales . Currently, police can only prosecute . owners of dogs who harm people in public places. They can only forcibly . remove illegal dogs under the Dangerous Dog Act 1991. These include the . pit bull terrier and the Japanese Tosa. Some critics want the law to be extended so owners can be prosecuted when an attack occurs on their property. But Dr Mugford said this is a step too . far. ‘You cannot legislate for an event like this, it’s just an awful . tragic accident,’ he said. In April, five-year-old Haley Turner . was bitten by a Jack Russell after reaching down to stroke the pet in a . neighbour’s garden in Otley, West Yorkshire.

Shocked: Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the scale of the problem was 'staggering' Celebrities, small firms and large corporations are among those robbing Britain of around £5billion of tax revenue every year, a damning report reveals today. The investigation, by the National Audit Office, lays bare the ‘staggering’ scale of tax avoidance – and warns that HM Revenue and Customs is struggling to control the epidemic. The Government spending watchdog says some 2,289 tax avoidance schemes have been disclosed to HMRC by experts over the last eight years. But Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said the disclosure regime, introduced in 2004, ‘has had little impact on the persistent use of highly contrived schemes which deprive the public purse of billions of pounds’. Tax avoidance is legal while tax evasion, which involves fraud or deliberate concealment, is not. According to HMRC’s own definition, tax avoidance is ‘using the tax law to get a tax advantage that Parliament never intended’. But the report reveals how HMRC wins more than eight in ten tax avoidance cases which end up in court, a sign of how tax experts are stretching the law to the point of absurdity. It is currently investigating around 41,000 tax avoidance cases among small firms and individuals – but about 15 per cent have been under investigation for between five and ten years. Probe: The investigation, by the National Audit Office (central London office pictured), lays bare the 'staggering' scale of tax avoidance - and warns that HM Revenue and Customs is struggling to control the epidemic . And it warns these 41,000 cases are estimated to have avoided a total of £10.2billion in tax over several years. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘The scale of the problem is staggering. 'People who pay their taxes promptly and in full will be dismayed to discover that the enormous level of tax avoidance taking place is overwhelming HMRC’s efforts to combat it.’ She said it was ‘particularly galling’ that taxes are not being paid at a time when the Government’s austerity drive is hitting essential services. Mrs Hodge said: ‘My concern is that without a credible plan to resolve these cases and to stamp out future avoidance, the public will lose confidence in the tax system’s ability to collect even-handedly what is due from all individuals and companies.’ The NAO report reveals the top five ‘mass marketed’ tax avoidance schemes alone have around 40,900 ‘users’ among small firms and individuals. Questions: Big businesses, such as Google, Starbucks (pictured) and Amazon, are caught up in a growing scandal about the amount of tax that they pay . Big businesses, such as Google, Starbucks and Amazon, are also caught up in a growing scandal about the amount of tax that they pay. To make matters worse, the report says HMRC is likely to ‘understate the true scale of avoidance’, and says the problem could be even larger. 'My concern is that without a credible plan to resolve these cases and to stamp out future avoidance, the public will lose confidence in the tax system’s ability to collect even-handedly what is due from all individuals and companies' Margaret Hodge, Labour MP and Public Accounts Committee chairman . It raised fears about specialist firms, dubbed ‘tax boutiques’, which exist solely for the purpose of helping people to avoid paying tax. The report reveals how they ‘stretch the rules to the limit and will typically exist only to invent and administer avoidance schemes.’ In each of the last four years, accountants and other  tax avoidance experts have ‘disclosed’ more than 118 new tax avoidance schemes to HMRC every single year. Since 2004 when the disclosure regime was introduced, HMRC has applied to tax tribunals against firms for not complying with the rules just 11 times. The maximum penalty is just £5,000. The number of tax avoidance cases which it brings to court is equally paltry. Between April 2010 and October 2012, just 110 cases went to court. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘HMRC has successfully challenged over 40 tax avoidance schemes through the courts in the last two years alone, successfully disrupting the avoidance industry through a combination of legal challenge and improved intelligence on  new schemes, and protecting around £4billion.’","National Audit Office inquiry lays bare 'staggering' scale of tax avoidance .

The former secretary to the former first lady of the Philippines was charged Tuesday in New York with conspiracy to sell valuable artworks that disappeared during the collapse of Imelda Marcos’ husband's regime. Vilma Bautista, 74, was indicted on charges of conspiracy, tax fraud and offering a false instrument for filing. Two of her nephews, Chaiyot Jansen Navalaksana and Pongsak Navalaksana, also were charged. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said Bautista used false paperwork to sell a work from Claude Monet's 'Water Lilies' series for $32 million in September 2010.

Views: Algerian View, by Albert Marquet, is another work that the Phillipine first lady acquired during her husband's presidency . Bautista is accused of secretly keeping and, with the help of two nephews, selling 'Le Bassin aux Nympheas,' one of Monet's 'Water Lilies' series, to a London gallery in 2010 for $32 million, according to Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. The nephews also were charged in the case.

Other paintings Bautista is accused of secretly keeping are Monet's 'L'Eglise et La Seine a Vetheuil,' Alfred Sisley's 'Langland Bay,' and Albert Marquet's 'Le Cypres de Djenan Sidi Said.' Imelda Marcos, known for her extravagant lifestyle and thousands of shoes, is not expected to face charges in the case, prosecutors said. Ferdinand Marcos died in 1989. 'The integrity of the international art market must be protected,' Vance said in a statement. 'This indictment sheds light on what happened to major works of art missing for more than 25 years.' Her attorney, Fran Hoffinger, said Bautista got caught in a civil dispute between the Marcoses and the Philippine government. 'It's a civil dispute,' Hoffinger said. 'It doesn't belong in criminal court.' According to the indictment, Bautista was a foreign service officer assigned to the Philippine Mission to the United Nations but unofficially served as Imelda Marcos' New York-based personal secretary. The indictment says that during the presidency of her husband, Ferdinand, Imelda Marcos used state assets to acquire a vast collection of artwork and other valuables. Prosecutors say some of the art ended up in Bautista's possession after the Marcoses were ousted in a citizen revolt in 1986.

There was also another Monet and Alfred Sisley's 'Langland Bay' from 1887. Prosecutors said Bautista and her nephews plotted to sell the paintings and keep the proceeds tax-free.

Judicial sources suggest the former French president is likely be placed under formal criminal investigation - the equivalent to being charged - following his appearance before judge Jean-Michel Gentil at the Palais de Justice in Bordeaux tomorrow. Mr Sarkozy will be grilled at length by the Judge over his links with Liliane Bettencourt, the l'Oreal heiress and France's richest woman. In the spotlight: Nicolas Sarkozy risks being placed under formal criminal investigation after he is grilled about his links with l'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt at a court in Bordeaux tomorrow . Controversial:  Nicolas Sarkozy, right, will be . grilled about his highly suspicious relationship with l’Oreal heiress . Liliane Bettencourt, left . The principal allegation in the so-called 'Bettencourt Affair' is that Sarkozy accepted thousands of pounds in illegal cash to fund his election campaign in 2007. In return, it is claimed, Mrs Bettencourt was offered massive tax breaks on her multi-million pounds fortune after Sarkozy came to power. While some believe Sarkozy will be quizzed 'as a witness', judicial sources told AFP, France's national news agency, that 'he may be indicted'. This would mean him facing the kind of criminal trial which his former mentor and predecessor as conservative president, Jacques Chirac, went through. Chirac ended up receiving a suspended prison sentence for fraud last December, becoming the first head of state in the history of the Fifth Republic to be treated as a common criminal. In Sarkozy's case, Judge Gentil is examining evidence that Sarkozy 'abused the weakness' of Mrs Bettencourt, who celebrates her 90th birthday today. Predecessor: Sarkozy could face the kind of criminal trial as former president, Jacques Chirac . Investigators are examining the withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of euros from Swiss bank accounts, and the claim that cash was delivered in brown envelopes. Sarkozy, who lost May's presidential election to Socialist Francois Hollande, has denied a series of allegations of illegal campaign financing. Police raided the Paris mansion Sarkozy shares with his third wife, Carla Bruni, in July - just weeks after he lost his presidential immunity from prosecution. Sarkozy's legal troubles mounted on Tuesday when it emerged that judges are investigating millions he spent on opinion polls when he was president. The allegation is that he enriched friends who produced the polls, many of which were used for personal reasons including gauging how popular Carla Bruni was as first lady. Sarkozy is also being probed over the Karachi Affair - a fraud enquiry centred on submarine sales to Pakistan - and allegations that he received millions from former Libyan despot Muammar Gaddafi. Despite all this, Sarkozy has not ruled out running for president again in 2017, and is attempting to set himself up as an international speaker in the Tony Blair and Bill Clinton mould. Sarkozy's aides said he was delivering a speech in London today - suggesting that he will travel direct to Bordeaux from the UK.","Humiliating prospect raised by .

Lucas had grown up with his father and stepmother while Thiago had been raised by his paternal grandmother in another town just 15 miles away in south east state of Espirito Santo. Their mother reportedly suffered health problems and was unable to look after them. Lucas had been told he had a long-lost brother three months ago and was desperate to find him. Lucas told Brazil’s A Gazeta newspaper: ‘I got really down when I found out. I wanted to find him to talk with him, play with him and be his friend.’ Lucas confided in the school's head teacher, Deuseli de Souza, 40, who tried to help for him by searching through the register of names at other schools in the region, but had no luck.

Death probe: The HSE is investigating the death of Savita Halappanavar died of blood poisoning after doctors refused her an abortion . The independence of a probe into the death of a mother who was refused an abortion in Ireland has been questioned after a series of blunders. The HSE investigation has bowed to pressure to remove three doctors from the seven-member inquiry panel because they were from Galway University Hospital, the hospital where Savita Halappanavar died, after a conflict of interest was questioned. Now it has emerged that the professor leading the investigation had previously helped write a report which was written in favour of more liberal abortion laws. Mrs Halappanavar, 31, died of blood poisoning after Irish doctors refused her an abortion at 17 weeks pregnant when she began miscarrying. She died of septicaemia a week later on October 28. Her grieving husband Praveen Halappanavar, 34, told how he begged doctors at Galway University Hospital to terminate the pregnancy, but they refused to do so because she was 'in a Catholic country' and the foetus's heartbeat was still present. In a recent interview he said that he has no intention of cooperating with the HSE investigation. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny has said . that the three replacement experts would ‘have no connection at all . with Galway University Hospital. In that sense the investigation will be . completely and utterly independent’. Grieving husband: Pictured on their wedding day, Mrs Halappanavar's husband Praveen Halappanavar begged doctors at Galway University Hospital to terminate the pregnancy after she began miscarrying and now refuses to assist investigators . Pro-life campaigners have argued that the head investigator, Professor Sabaratnam Arulkumaran, head of obstetrics and gynaecology and deputy head of clinical sciences at St George’s Hospital in London, should not be allowed to stay on after revelations about a medical paper he co-wrote in 2009. The paper, entitled Safer Childbirth: A Rights-Based Approach, says that countries with more liberal abortion laws have lower death rates from pregnancy. The HSE stated that it would be challenging to find any obstetrician who did not have an opinion on pro-life or pro-choice issues and argued that Prof Arulkumaran’s qualification in the field was ‘beyond reproach’ and that his opinions previously expressed were irrelevant to the probe. Independence questioned: The investigation is under scrutiny after three doctors who work at the hospital where she died were on the panel, sparking a conflict of interest debate but Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny (left) said the replacements will have no connection with the hospital. It was also revealed that head investigator Prof Sabaratnam Arulkumaran (right) wrote a pro-abortion paper in 2009 . Refused begging: Doctors at Galway University Hospital (pictured) refused Mrs Halappanavar refused an abortion because she was 'in a Catholic country' and the foetus's heartbeat was still present . In response to Mr Halappanavar's refusal to help the investigation, Prof Arulkumaran hoped to persuade the grieving husband to talk to investigators. His testimony on Mrs Halappanavar’s care was essential to identifying problems, the professor said. Thousands of protesters took to the streets in rallies around Ireland on Saturday to pay tribute to Mrs Halappanavar as campaigners demanded changes in the law to allow abortion in the case where the mother's life is in danger. The Irish Health Minister James Reilly is set to present a report to Cabinet next week from a group of abortion experts but will not make any recommendation. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties . is pushing for an independent inquiry. They said that the best way to . involve hospital staff in the investigation was to call them as . witnesses rather than panel members. Director . Mark Kelly was quoted in the Irish Independent saying: ‘This remains an . internal HSE investigation into the conduct of persons employed by the . HSE.’ Campaigning for change: Thousands took to the streets of Dublin on Saturday to pay tribute to Mrs Halappanavar and demanded changes to abortion laws in Ireland . Tribute to mother: People light candles in Galway on Saturday as investigations into the 31-year-old's death continue . India's ambassador to Ireland said last week that Mrs Halappanavar might still be alive today if she had been treated in India. Debashish Chakravarti told RTÉ radio that he hoped the Irish government would take steps to ensure the circumstances which led to her death never arose again. Mr Halappanavar, who works as an engineer at Boston Scientific in Galway, came to Ireland from India with his wife four years ago to start a new life together. She had a job in Westport, Co Mayo and the pair lived in Galway city. They were so excited about the expected birth of their first child, which was due on March 20, that they had an early baby shower in recent weeks when Mrs Halappanavar’s parents were visiting.","Savita Halappanavar died of blood poisoning after an abortion was refused .

To help their relationship: Councillor David Sprason (right) admitted to watching hardcore porn film 'She Likes It Rough' on a council laptop with wife Sue Sprason (left) because their home DVD player broke . Mr Sprason, 56, yesterday said the film was one of the ‘tools’ the couple used to ‘help’ their relationship. The DVD was found when Mr Sprason . took his laptop to council IT workers for repairs. He said: ‘The laptop . crashed and I took it to get it repaired. I should have taken the film . out and put it back in its box. ‘I was probably rushing around the next morning and grabbed it before going in to County Hall. ‘Me . and the wife use things to help our relationship. That’s one of the . tools we use. We both enjoy them. It’s one of those situations that . shouldn’t have happened. ‘I’m not embarrassed. There was nothing dodgy about it. ‘It’s the kind of thing that can easily be bought in an adult shop.’ The . incident took place in 2007, but has only just come to light after a . copy of a confidential letter sent to Mr Sprason by former . Leicestershire County Council monitoring officer Elizabeth McCalla was . anonymously leaked to a local newspaper. In the letter, Miss McCalla said the DVD had been sent to the police ‘to ensure it did not contain any unlawful material’. Investigated: Leicestershire County Council checked Cl Sprason's internet usage from the laptop and found nothing untoward but since the incident has gone public, Tory whips are doing their own internal investigation . She . said: ‘They subsequently advised me the DVD contained hardcore . pornography of the type you might be able to buy in this country, but . more likely to buy abroad or over the internet, but that no criminal . offence had been committed.’ Although it was considered that Mr . Sprason had breached council policy, the letter said the matter was not . pursued because the DVD was watched in a private capacity. Mrs Sprason said of the porn film: ‘Our DVD player broke so we unfortunately used a county council laptop (to watch it). ‘We are a middle-aged couple who love each other as much as we did when we were in our 20s. ‘When you get to middle age, you need a bit of assistance.’ After . the DVD was found five years ago, officers at council headquarters . checked Mr Sprason’s internet usage and found nothing untoward. However, . Miss McCalla warned him not to view pornography on a county council . computer again ‘otherwise I have no alternative but to pursue the matter . further’. Mr . Sprason yesterday said he had referred the incident to the Conservative . group on the council in order for whips to investigate, after he became . aware the letter had been leaked. 'Error of judgement': Cl Sprason said he forgot to take the DVD out of the computer's CD drive before handing it to council IT workers for repair . He has stepped down as deputy leader but will continue as a councillor while the investigation continues. The . councillor, who represents Markfield, Desford and Thornton, said: ‘Most . of the feedback I have had from  people is that this is all a storm in a . tea cup. ‘If this damages . my chances of re-election then so be it but I am honest and . straightforward and it is better to be open. I am just an ordinary guy . who works hard for his patch and that is what I’ll continue to do.’ Nick . Rushton, the council leader, said that under new Conservative group . rules introduced following the resignation in July of his predecessor, . David Parsons, members were required to either step down or be suspended . while an investigation took place to ensure no breach of the party’s . rules had taken place. Mr Rushton said it was imperative the . authority was ‘seen to be acting in accordance with the highest . standards of conduct’, adding that Mr Sprason had made the ‘right . decision, personally and in the interests of the council’s reputation’. Mr Rushton said he found it . ‘disappointing’ that Mr Parsons didn’t ‘deal with this matter properly . through the group rules at the time’. Mr Parsons resigned shortly after it emerged police had begun an investigation into his travel expense claims.","IT workers found the DVD in Councillor David Sprason's work laptop .

This unsightly and unshapely Christmas tree, with just a few sorry-looking bulbs and baubles, was slammed as Britain's worst festive decoration this week after crowds jeered at its big unveiling. About a thousand people, including excited children, turned out in the bitter cold to watch pantomime stars Gareth Gates and Toyah Wilcox flick the switch to turn on Herne Bay's Christmas lights. But they were left stunned when the 'shocking' lights, which barely covered the tree, flickered into life. Many stormed off in disgust as boos and jeers rang out. 'Atrocious': Crowds booed as lights on this Christmas tree in Herne Bay, Kent flickered into life. The town had persuaded panto stars Gareth Gates and Toyah Wilcox to turn on the decorations, but crowds were left bitterly disappointed . It later emerged that Canterbury City Council spent a whopping £83,000 on Christmas tree decorations for Canterbury, Whitstable and Herne Bay this year, though the Herne Bay business association were responsible for funding the tree. One resident condemned the decorations as looking like a couple of domestic lightbulbs, while a local businessman laughingly claimed he had more decorations in his shop window. Other shop owners claimed the pathetic decorations would affect their vital Christmas trade. They had been encouraged to open late for last Friday's switch-on but most potential shoppers had drifted away by 5.45pm. Greengrocer Stan Truelove, 57, said: 'It took me an hour to put some lights and a few decorations up in my shop and it definitely looks better than these lights. 'We were asked to keep our shops open until 7pm but everyone left at 5.45pm. 'Christmas tree lights are supposed to put you in the mood for shopping but no one will want to spend money here. 'The lights are a waste of money because they look terrible.' Grand switch-on: Herne Bay had managed to attract Gareth Gates (left) and Toyah Wilcox (right) to switch on the town's Christmas tree lights and over one thousand residents turned out to watch them . Seaside resort: Businesses in Herne Bay had been hoping the lights would offer them a Christmas boost . Steve Warrener, a sports shop owner, added: 'I think it must have been embarrassing for the council. 'There were a lot of people there and we had two stars in Gareth Gates and Toyah Wilcox. What must they have thought? 'There was no wow factor there at all. I just walked away.' Sparse: Residents and local shop owners said the unsightly tree would do little to entice Christmas shoppers to the town . A disappointed mother-of-three, who asked not to be named, said: 'I could not believe how bad the lights are. 'It was supposed to be this grand unveiling but the lights look atrocious - they were so bad people started booing. 'I think it must be the country's worst set of Christmas lights.' Salon owner Lou Richards added: 'I'm absolutely fuming. Why would you come to Herne Bay to see light bulbs? The tree is an absolute joke.' Canterbury City Council have launched a consultation over the Christmas lights. A spokesman said: 'The display in Herne Bay this year is the same as last year's, with the exception of some netting. 'Consultation on Christmas lights will start with businesses soon and we'll be keen to talk to those traders who are showing an interest in the display in their towns.' The council had provided £83,000 to pay for the decorations in Canterbury, Whitstable and Herne Bay. They added that the Herne Bay business association was responsible for raising any extra funds for the tree. But Coastal Towns manger Chris West said: 'There was more than a thousand people and it was bigger crowd than in Whitstable.'","Crowds jeered in Herne Bay as 'atrocious' tree was lit up .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:05 EST, 21 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 20:48 EST, 21 November 2012 . One of the world’s richest men, Hong Kong property magnate Samuel Tak Lee, today lost his appeal against a court decision to award his ex-mistress two London properties he claimed were his. In July last year, High Court judge Mr Justice Norris ruled in July last year that married Mr Lee - who he described as 'one of the world’s truly super rich' - lied when he claimed that masseuse Fuk Fei Wu was only his employee, and not his mistress. Though Mr Lee did not appeal that finding, he claimed that the judge wrongly focused on the nature of the relationship when he should have concentrated on legal documents he claimed showed he was intended to retain ownership of two homes on Avonmore Road, London, which he bought for £1.5 and £1.6 million in 2008. At the HIgh Court: Samuel Tak Lee, pictured left, today lost his appeal against a court decision to award his former mistress Fuk Fei Wu, pictured right, two London properties he insisted belonged to him . But Lord Justice McCombe LJ dismissed his appeal today, stating: 'The nature of the entire case, and ultimately the rival cases about the disputed properties, was coloured by Mr Lee’s untruthful and dishonest account of his relationship with Ms Wu. Its true nature gave the explanation for the acquisition of these properties.' In the ruling under challenge, Mr Justice Norris rejected Mr Lee’s claim to ownership of the properties and found that one of the properties was intended as a gift to her, while the other was bought with money he gave her. Mr Lee had argued at the High Court that Ms Wu was only an employee and that she was intended to run the one of the houses as a hotel enterprise. He said the house formed part of his complex and secretive business model known as 'Zho Wen Xuan', named after a Chinese businessman from Ms Wu’s hometown . But Ms Wu claimed that she was his mistress and that they met after he responded to a newspaper advertisement she placed seeking a 'spouse'. She claimed he encouraged her to emulate him and Zhou Wen Xuan, who started with nothing and built a commercial empire. The rightful owner: The court found that one of the properties, the Avonmore Hotel, was given as a gift to Ms Wu while the other was bought with money Mr Lee had given her . Though Mr Justice Norris found that Ms Wu was 'frequently an untruthful person', he said in his written ruling in July 2011 that on the issues of their relationship he was satisfied that she was telling the truth and Mr Lee was not. He said: 'She was not a business functionary but a sexual companion. In this regard, Mr Lee has not incorrectly recollected matters. He has been deliberately untruthful. He has lied.' He added: 'Mr Lee was a generally truthful person: but he has lied to me because, I think, he sees it necessary for his honour and his reputation to demonstrate that he can control people within his realm of management, and Ms Wu resists his control. 'He certainly does not care about the money, which is to him next to nothing. His case could not have been harder fought.' Mr Lee’s lawyers argued on appeal that their client’s testimony about his relationship status with Ms Wu should have had no bearing on the case in light of contemporaneous documents that showed the clear intention that he would be the true owner of the properties. In written submissions to the court they claimed that it was clear that Mr Lee might have had reasons for lying about whether he had had an affair with Ms Wu which had nothing to do with whether he was telling the truth about the property ownership agreement. However, dismissing the appeal, Lord Justice McCombe said that the judge was not bound simply to construe the documents 'in isolation from the realities of the case', and that he was correct to have regard to the whole of the evidence. He added: 'For reasons that the judge explains at substantial length, he found that the relationship between Mr Lee and Ms Wu was not as Mr Lee contended. 'The relationship was one of companionship and was sexual in its nature. This was clearly a significant feature of the case to which the judge quite properly gave weight.' He said that Mr Lee had lavished 'large sums, which to ordinary people would seem extraordinary' on Ms Wu, providing jewels, watches and furs to the value of some £123,000 on top of money and properties. He continued: 'The fact that Mr Lee had lied so compendiously about this relationship and this type of expenditure, as the judge quite properly found on the evidence before him, was obviously highly relevant to the issues in the case. These matters put the property acquisitions in context. 'I reject entirely the submission for Mr Lee that these matters were of no relevance at all and that all one had to do was to construe, in a formalistic legal fashion, the language of the solicitors’ documents and certain individual remarks taken from a series of confused and confusing telephone conversations.' The Court ordered Mr Lee to pay Ms Wu’s legal costs, and make a £50,000 payment up front.","Property magnate Samuel Tak Lee appealed against court ruling giving his mistress two London houses - claiming Fuk Fei Wu was just an employee .

Lauren Hughes, pictured, died three days after being admitted to hospital with an asthma attack . Nurses who didn’t know how to give the kiss of life went into a panic when a child was admitted to hospital with a severe asthma attack. Her family described scenes of hysteria as staff who were meant to be helping their daughter desperately tried to call senior medics to ask them what to do. Three days later, 15-year-old Lauren Hughes died having suffered brain damage due to a lack of oxygen. The appalling case was revealed by her parents today in a damning report by the Patients Association into failings in NHS care. Pat and Dolly Hughes said one nurse became so distraught at the Ross-on-Wye community hospital she had to be calmed down by a colleague. They said they couldn’t understand how a healthy teenager was able to die of an asthma attack while in hospital. The hospital trust later admitted the nurses at its minor injuries unit weren’t trained in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and should have dialled 999. Lauren had been taken to the unit by her mother when she started to suffer an asthma attack. Initially they couldn’t even get into the hospital as the door had been locked for the evening. Lauren – who was in obvious distress – was also ignored by two paramedics walking out of the hospital who did not stop to help or even let her in. She was eventually transferred to University Hospital North Staffordshire but died three days after the initial attack in May. Dr Peter Wilson, Medical Director at Wye Valley NHS Trust, which runs the community hospital said the trust has carried out a ‘full review’ of the unit where Lauren was treated. Staff have also admitted that nurses are not trained to do CPR as it is ‘above and beyond what is expected of them’. Untrained: Nurses at the Ross-on-Wye Community Hospital didn't know how to carry out the kiss of life . Today’s report on NHS care also found cases of patients being treated ‘worse than animals’ and ridiculed by ‘rude’ nurses. Relatives also say doctors are ignoring their pleas to promise to resuscitate loved ones should they stop breathing. Some families spoke of a lack of compassion among staff who didn’t care if patients ‘lived or died’. In one case, the daughter of a 94-year-old man who was being neglected by nurses told them ‘you wouldn’t treat an animal like that’. Sandra Lamb also revealed how a doctor refused to sign a form agreeing to resuscitate her father should he stop breathing. In another example, an elderly man with dementia was allowed to wander out of hospital and drowned in a river. The family of Ronald Bowman, who was being treated at the Panteg Hospital, Pontypool, South Wales, think he was trying to get home to his wife. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association said: ‘The sad conclusion of this report is that still far too many patients are being shockingly let down by the NHS every day. ‘These appalling and tragic cases serve to highlight the devastating consequences when poor practice is left unchallenged and unchanged. Behind each one are many more unheard voices. ‘Whilst there is a lot to be proud of about the NHS, including the overwhelming majority of staff who are skilled and hard-working, these cases are a tragic wake-up call for those in Westminster as well as on hospital wards.’ Over the past few years a number of reports have drawn attention to examples of poor hospital care, particularly involving the elderly. The Government, along with various NHS organisations, has repeatedly promised to drive up standards and change the culture of the health service. But the Patients Association said that little had changed. It has been producing annual reports of poor care since 2009. Mike Farrah, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health service staff, described the stories in the report as ‘shocking and deeply distressing’. Alzheimer's patient Ronald Bowman, who went missing from a 'dementia friendly' ward, drowned in a river near the hospital . An Alzheimer’s patient who went missing from a 'dementia friendly' ward drowned in a river near the hospital, his son said. Nick Bowman has accused Panteg County Hospital staff of not appropriately caring for his father Ronald, from Langstone in Newport, who died earlier this year. He said that his family had been assured by healthcare professionals that his 74-year-old father was being well looked after. But after escaping the ward, which is especially designed for patients with dementia, Mr Bowman drowned in a river near to the hospital. The family believe that Mr Bowman was trying to cross the river so he could get home to his wife. Mr Bowman was admitted to the Royal Gwent Hospital suffering with meningitis. He was later transferred to the Hafen Deg ward at Panteg County Hospital in Pontypool, South Wales. His family were told that he would be checked on by ward staff every 15 minutes. But Mr Bowman managed to escape from the ward twice, being found once in the hospital car park and in the reception. Mr Bowman went missing for a third and final time in June this year. Police found his shoes at the bank of a river near to the hospital. Three weeks later Mr Bowman’s body was found four miles downstream from the hospital. His son said: 'We believed that as he had left the ward twice before, that the medical staff would be especially diligent when keeping an eye on my father. This was not the case. 'My family and I are incredibly hurt and distressed that after my father was admitted to hospital with meningitis, and seemingly making a recovery, he was left without any of the basic care that he deserved and he needed.' King George's Hospital, in Ilford, Essex . Joan Girdiefski is afraid to be admitted to her local hospital following the treatment of her sister Margaret Allen. She had been admitted to King George’s Hospital, in Ilford, Essex, and was suffering from advanced breast cancer. Mrs Girdiefski told the Patients Association that when her other sister phoned the ward to ask after Margaret, she was told by a nurse: ‘She is screaming away nicely.’ She said: ‘I would rather die on my own settee than be admitted into the local hospital, because I would hate to depend on people that wouldn’t care if I either lived or died.’ Sandra Lamb accused a doctor at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital of acting like God when he refused to promise to resuscitate her father Edward. Mrs Lamb said on one evening she had tried to summon a nurse to help the 94-year-old  but there was no one on the ward. She then noticed 18 other patients had pressed their ‘assistance lights’. When a consultant refused to sign a form promising to resuscitate her father, she told him: ‘You are not God. I brought my father here to make him well, not to kill him.’ Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham .

The elderly man had been admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham with bowel problems. Mrs Lamb said that on one evening she had tried to summon a nurse to help her father go to the toilet but there was no-one on the ward. She then noticed that ‘assistance lights’ had been pressed on the beds of 18 other patients on the wards who had not yet been attended by nurses. And when she tried to get the consultant to sign a form promising to resuscitate her father should the need arise he refused. She said: ‘I asked him why he would not resuscitate if necessary and the reason he gave was that he would not be willing to put his signature to.’ Mr Lamb died last September.","The Patients Association report discloses how some doctors are 'acting like God' by telling relatives they will not try and resuscitate their loved ones .

Treating ADHD in convicted criminals could have a major impact on reoffending, a study suggests. Criminal behaviour in people diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) falls by about a third when they are on medication, the research shows. Translated to the prison population, similar treatment could have a dramatic effect, experts believe. Treating ADHD in convicted criminals could have a major impact on reoffending . Around four per cent of children in the UK and half as many adults are believed to suffer from the disorder, which is characterised by over-activity, impulsivity, aggression, short temper and disorganised thinking. But a disproportionate number of people with ADHD end up being convicted of petty crimes, often related to violence and drug abuse. Studies suggest that anything from 10 per cent to 40 per cent of prison inmates have the disorder, but few are diagnosed or treated. Treating ADHD-affected children with drugs such as the stimulant Ritalin is controversial because of the side effects, which can include nervous system disturbances and raised blood pressure and heart rate. The research was conducted in Sweden, . where it is easy to access data on medical treatments and criminal . convictions through national registries. Scientists studied the records of more than 25,000 individuals with ADHD, mostly teenagers and young adults. They . found that over a period of four years, 37 per cent of the men and 15 . per cent of the women were convicted of crimes, compared with a rate in . the general population of 9 per cent and 2 per cent. Drug . treatment for ADHD was associated with a 32 per cent drop in offending . rates by men and 41 per cent by women - an overall reduction of about a . third. But the study authors say such drugs could have a real impact on crime, although their use would have to be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. The findings are published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Professor Paul Lichtenstein, one of the researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, said: 'It's said that roughly 30 per cent to 40 per cent of long-serving criminals have ADHD. 'If their chances of recidivism can be reduced by 30 per cent, it would clearly affect total crime numbers in many societies.' Almost 27 per cent of convicted criminals released from prisons in England and Wales reoffend within a year, according to the latest Ministry of Justice figures. Besides crime, ADHD is linked to many problems that can afflict a person's life, including poor academic performance, unemployment, alcohol and drug abuse, and relationship breakdown. However, although the disorder is known to persist into adulthood, treatment invariably stops in adolescence. British expert Professor Philip Asherson, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, said he would expect to see wide-ranging benefits if convicted criminals were regularly treated for ADHD. 'If they were in prison and showing aggressive or difficult behaviour, I'd hope to see a reduction in those aggressive behaviours,' he said. Almost 27 per cent of convicted criminals released from prisons in England and Wales reoffend within a year, according to the latest Ministry of Justice figures . 'I'd also expect to see more engagement with rehabilitation processes. 'In the long run, in the community, if people remained engaged in treatment you'd expect to see reduced rates of repeat offending but also better adjustment overall. 'They'd be more able to find employment and maintain themselves in employment, and generate better relationship and social structures. 'We would hope to see maybe half of these people showing significant benefits, but we do need to do the research.' He pointed out that drug treatment for ADHD cost around £100 - £300 per patient per month, which was 'vastly outweighed' by the financial burden of criminal behaviour.","Around four per cent of children in the UK and half as many adults are believed to suffer from ADHD .

Police are treating both deaths as 'unexplained' It is understood police are investigating the possibility that Mrs Ziemba may have had a 'cardiac episode', fallen, and hurt herself. Officers are believed to be investigating the theory that her husband then tried to comfort her before injuring himself and lying next to her for several hours. A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said: 'They had no defensive injuries, so that would suggest that no one else was involved. 'There is an ongoing investigation and officers are looking at lots of possibilities. 'It's just very sad.' Initial post-mortem findings indicate the 89-year-old, who had bruising on her body, may have fallen. Police are investigating how the the elderly couple came to suffer multiple injuries in the property in Newbury .

He died after being taken to the John . Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Preliminary post-mortem findings revealed . he had injuries which indicated he had fallen heavily. It is also believed he had internal . complications arising from him having been lying down for many hours. Like his wife, there were no signs of assault or defensive injuries, . police disclosed. The couple had lived in the property for more than 30 years. Detective Chief Inspector Gill Wootton said: 'While the preliminary findings of the post mortems into these two deaths appear to indicate a tragic incident, we are continuing our detailed forensic investigation at the scene and investigative inquiries in the area. 'We are acting on behalf of the family and the coroner to fully determine the circumstances around these deaths and also to preclude any third party involvement.' Next of kin have been informed but formal identification has yet to take place. Retired shop worker Pam Cooper, who lives opposite the couple's home, said she thought Mr Ziemba had a Polish background and had served on destroyer ships during the Second World War. Mrs Cooper, 65, added that she understood Mrs Ziemba had been unwell recently. 'They have got family and quite a lot of friends, there are often people in and out of there. 'They are very well-liked. When he was about he was always chatty.' Builder David Yates, a neighbour of the couple, said he would occasionally help Mr Ziemba with odd jobs around the home. Mr Yates, 50, said Mr Ziemba had been torpedoed three times as he sailed with the Merchant Navy in the Atlantic convoys during the Second World War. 'He was very jolly and always happy to say hello.

The Missing Persons Bureau published a . report on the number of missing persons and unidentified bodies in . Britain based on figures provided by forces across the country on the . number of missing person incidents reported in 2010/11. The bureau are a total of around 1,000 unidentified cases which remain unidentified. Just six per cent of those involve . living people, most of whom have been found without identification and . suffer from a form of memory loss or dementia. The vast majority of cases - 83 per . cent - the bureau is desperate to solve involve dead bodies while there . are still more than 100 unidentified body parts (11 per cent) sitting in . police morgues across Britain waiting to be identified. with a small . number of body parts (11 per cent) and unidentified alive people (6 per cent) also still . awaiting identification. Joe Apps, from the Bureau, said: 'The . aim of the new site is to bring closure to the families and friends of . the people featured. 'With new unidentified person cases . we rely on modern forensic techniques for identification but on older . cases we look to use every tool available and believe that case . publicity is the best chance of getting images recognised. 'This will be the first time families of missing people have been able to search through records for themselves and it will empower families to play an active part in the search for their loved ones.' Members of the public will be able to search the cases and provide information online. Any relevant details will then be passed to the police or the coroner in charge of the case. Details of all unidentified cases, including bodies, remains and living people, will be posted on the website - apart from cases where remains are too partial to be of value. The site: The bureau has now launched a new website which is dedicated to finding the identity of mystery individuals . The bureau was unable to give any details of individual cases - other that the ones highlighted here - but a spokesperson said the website had already been significantly slowed due to the amount of traffic it has already received. The UK Missing Persons Bureau continually work with police forces and the public to try to put a name to these individuals, to enable them to be put at rest and to provide closure for their family and friends. The Bureau is also running a special project, called Operation Kharon, providing resources to assist police forces to identify their outstanding unidentified people, bodies and body part cases. Similar websites have been set up in certain states in the U.S, and by police in Belgium and Switzerland. The Missing Persons Bureau is part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency.

It's a well-known theme tune that conjures up images of Lancaster bombers and air raid sirens. So shoppers at a German Christmas market in Birmingham were left feeling confused rather than festive when they heard the famous Dam Busters theme tune being blared out at the carousel. Visitors to the huge Frankfurt Christmas Market in the city's Victoria Square said the tune, written by British composer Eric Coates for the 1955 war movie, The Dam Busters, was being played there up to nine times a day. German delights: Stalls at the traditional Frankfurt Christmas Market which visits Birmingham UK every year sell pretzels, sausages, and other local delicacies . The film, starring Michael Redgrave and Richard Todd, depicts the daring raid by 617 Squadron on the Möhne, Eder and Sorpe dams deep in wartime Germany. One shopper said he was shocked to hear the stirring tune as he shopped at the market last week. 'It stopped me in my tracks when I realised what the tune was on the carousel, and it put a smile on my face. 'Who says the Germans haven't got a sense of humour?  Either that or someone's taking the mick at their expense.' Stirring stuff: shoppers at Birmingham's popular Christmas market were surprised to hear the Dam Busters theme tune as they strolled amongst the German stalls . The annual Christmas shopping extravaganza has been staged in Birmingham for the past 11 years and is now the largest outdoor Christmas market in the country. Traditional German stalls offer grilled sausages, German mulled wine (Glühwein), pretzels, German beer and gingerbread, among other treats.  It runs from 15 November until 22 December and attracts scores of visitors to its nearly 200 stalls. Daring raid: The Dam Busters tells the true story of how the British attacked the German dams in WW2. This scene from the 1955 film recreates the Lancaster bombers in the 1943 raid . Popular wartime drama: the film tells the story of Operation Chastise, when the RAF attacked three German dams with Barnes Wallis' 'bouncing bomb' A spokesman for Birmingham City Council, which organises the contract for the funfair at the event, said 'We do not have any control over the music the carousel plays.

A sex pest who terrorised women with 17,000 perverted phone calls in just one year has been jailed for 30 months. Married Martin Poulter, 51, from Southampton, made calls to random numbers at night in the hopes a female would answer. He would then breathe heavily and make 'disgusting, lewd sexual comments' as he described what he was doing to himself. Guilty: Martin Poulter was sentenced to jail for 30 months after he made almost 17,000 inappropriate calls to random women . Spending almost all of his £440 monthly . benefits on credit for his unregistered pay-as-you-go mobile phone, he . visited the same Co-op store so often staff even named him 'top up man'. It transpired he was spending around £5,280 a year on phone credit. Poulter made a staggering 16,690 calls on his phone between January 2010 and February 2011, 13,346 of which were dialled between 11pm and 6am. Southampton Crown Court heard that some of his victims were targeted repeatedly, leaving them scared and physically sick as he 'moaned and groaned' down the phone. The youngest victim of his 'deeply disturbing' campaign was just 17. The court was told Poulter simply changed digits in mobile numbers, randomly dialling people across the country, hanging up if a man answered. Prosecutor Siobhan Linsley traced back Poulter's calls to January 2010, saying one woman from Wiltshire had phoned police to report receiving 'obscene' calls in the middle of the night. She lived alone with two young children and said she felt threatened by the anonymous one-minute-long calls. Her mobile phone company provided her with the number that had been calling her but police could not trace the owner as it was not registered. Another victim was a student who was subjected to 'diabolical language' in the middle of her exams. 'Deeply disturbing': Southampton Crown Court (above) heard that some of Poulter's victims were targeted repeatedly, and the youngest victim was just 17 . In October 2010 police were informed that top-up cards were being bought for the phone at a Co-op store in Southampton. Detectives investigated and traced 21 victims around the country, who provided statements. Workers at the store were initially unable to identify the man, but when police returned in January 2011 staff knew exactly who he was - and revealed they had nicknamed him 'top-up man' because he visited so often. Poulter was eventually traced when he used his wife’s Co-op store card. When police went to his home they found he had made his final nuisance call just moments before they arrived. He initially denied the offence but admitted one charge of making public nuisance phone calls on the day he was due to stand trial. Jamie Porter, defending, said Poulter was 'sexually frustrated'. He agreed any suggestion Poulter would stop offending went 'against all common sense'. Jailing Poulter for 30 months, Judge Peter Henry QC described the phone calls as 'deeply disturbing'. 'They were completely random and you had no idea whether you were going to be talking to a person under 16 or not. 'They were highly unpleasant and upsetting. 'Your victims had no idea whether you were around the corner, watching them, or just a sad person calling from somewhere else in the country.' 'Top-up man': Police were informed that top-up cards were being bought for the phone at a Co-op store in Southampton (pictured). He was eventually traced by his wife's store card . It’s not the first time that Poulter has struck. Almost 20 years ago, in 1985, he was before the courts for similar public nuisance offences. He made around 200 calls to women in which he told them he was holding someone they knew hostage. He then threatened to kill or harm his imaginary hostage unless they complied with his sexual requests. Poulter was then convicted of four counts of making threats to kill and a further charge of causing a public nuisance. Today’s custodial sentence is believed to be the first since the law surrounding 'public nuisance' was changed to include silent and disturbing calls. Detective Constable Amy Speed, who led the investigation, said after the case, 'A huge number of women around the country will sleep better tonight knowing their tormentor has been given a custodial sentence. 'His actions were despicable and cowardly and the impact should not be underestimated. 'His victims had their privacy and security of their homes invaded'.","Martin Poulter, 51, made 'disgusting, lewd sexual comments'

A great-grandfather was left for dead by an ‘evil’ young mother and her partner who attacked him in his own home. Arnold Hilton, 88, had his life ‘destroyed’ when Aurelisa Galdikaite and Laurynas Dauksas broke in and inflicted ‘severe violence’ on him. Mother-of-one Galdikaite, 23, ransacked ‘every drawer, in every room’ of the house while Dauksas repeatedly punched and kicked Mr Hilton. The Lithuanian couple then left their victim lying on his bedroom floor, covered in blood. Life destroyed: After the horrific robbery 89-year-old Arnold Hilton, pictured with his grandchild, needs round-the-clock care and barricades himself in his bedroom at night . Galdikaite was jailed for nine years for the despicable crime, while Dauksas, 25, got 11 years. The morning after the attack, Mr Hilton’s son Stuart found him bleeding on the floor with his belongings scattered around him. When he saw his son Mr Hilton said: ‘I’m not going to make it.’ The father-of-five, now 89, spent two weeks in hospital before he was well enough to be moved to a care home, but remains so traumatised that he barricades his bedroom door shut at night. Liverpool Crown Court heard that Galdikaite and Dauksas  inflicted ‘severe violence’ on Mr Hilton after they broke into his home in Upholland, Lancashire, on the night of March 20. Evil crime: Aurelisa Galdikaite, 23, and her partner Laurynas Dauksas, 25, attacked Mr Hilton in his home, robbed him, and left him for dead . As Galdikaite raided the house, Dauksas, on licence after being released from prison for a motoring offence, repeatedly punched and kicked the former Bevin Boy – one of the thousands conscripted into the coal mines during the Second World War. Jailing the pair, Judge David Aubrey, QC, said: ‘This was an evil, despicable offence on a man who was in the autumn of his life and prior to this sustained attack had enjoyed pottering and socialising with his friends. ‘You have, in effect, destroyed his life. He now remains confused, upset and distressed and his health has deteriorated.’ Paul Becker, prosecuting, had earlier told the court Mr Hilton was struck several times by Dauksas. He said: ‘There were nine areas where the bruising indicated direct force by punching and kicking. These included head, chest and shoulders.’ In police interviews, Galdikaite and Dauksas claimed they had been drinking and were looking for her missing dog when they stumbled across Mr Hilton’s home. Hospitalised: The 'evil' Lithuanian pair inflicted 'severe violence' on Mr Hilton and before leaving him in his bedroom covered in blood . Police said they stole a cheque book and a Gurkha knife after attacking Mr Hilton. The cheque book was recovered but the knife has never been found. The defendants were arrested within 48 hours of the attack after Galdikaite’s fingerprints were found on a biscuit tin in Mr Hilton’s home. They both pleaded guilty to one count of robbery. Both defendants, of Wigan, face automatic deportation on their release. Detective Inspector Marc Nasser said: ‘Stuart Hilton called in to see his father as a matter of routine en-route to work and finding his father in that state must have been devastating.’ He added: ‘The level of violence used was beyond comprehension. Sadly as a result of this Arnold lives in a care home and will never be able to return home. He has lost much of his independence and confidence.’ So active: Mr Hilton's son Stuart described the 89-year-old as an active man who was well known in his local community before the attack . Distraught family members said the former glazing firm managing director has become a ‘shadow of his former self’. Mr Hilton, 43, said his father was a keen golfer who has ten grandchildren and one great-grandchild, adding: ‘It is heart-breaking to see him like this. ‘He was a man in the last years of his life and they should have been peaceful but he has been destroyed. He is terrified of being attacked again and sometimes even puts a chair in front of his door because he thinks they are going to come back. ‘He was a well-known local character and loved to socialise with his friends. He was so active and fit and loved his sport, he played golf for years and enjoyed watching football and rugby. He’s gone from going out three or four times a week to living in a care home and having 24-hour care.","'Evil' Lithuanian lovers ransacked home of now 89-year-old Arnold Hilton .

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 08:35 EST, 26 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:57 EST, 26 November 2012 . A web of tens of thousands of bogus companies set up in Britain and fronted by sham directors dotted around the globe is helping aggressive tax evaders and criminals keep millions, an investigation revealed today. An undercover BBC probe has exposed the illegal scam after they secretly filmed brokers bragging they had more chance of 'winning the lottery' than being caught by HM Revenue and Customs. Tonight's Panorama lays bare a network of at least 21,000 of these companies, headed by just a few dozen puppet managers in various obscure countries who are paid just to front the tax fiddle. Scroll down for video . Claims: Jesse Hester (left) was filmed saying the undercover journalist had more chance of winning the lottery than being caught while James Turner (right) said HMRC had 'never got to the money' View: MD Russell Lebe told the undercover reporter that if they were approached by the authorities about money laundering they would hand over his details, but his response about tax evasion was as pictured . Many of these 'corporate service . providers' are based in the UK - and are willing to set up tax evasion . schemes and sometimes allow money laundering of criminal funds. Behind the scenes these . brokers are controlling the investments, and cleaning dirty money or . hiding assets from the UK tax man. James Turner of Turner Little in York, said on film he had 10,000 of these set up and HMRC had 'never got to the money'. Admitting that they were fronted by . nominee directors he said: 'They won't even know that they are a . director, they just get paid,' adding that these individuals just sign . off documents and send it back in the post. The BBC also filmed Russell Lebe, Managing Director of Readymade Companies Worldwide, who was willing to invest money via India. He said if the authorities got in contact about potential tax evasion 'we wouldn't give a monkeys'. Explanation: Mr Turner said by using bogus directors the investor's involvement cannot be traced . One undercover reporter approached a . broker and said he had £6million of undeclared cash in Switzerland, and . was told to siphon it through Belize, which would be controlled in . secret behind one of these puppet directors. Jesse Hester, from Atlas Corporate Services, is filmed saying: 'Tax authorities don't have the resources to chase everybody down. They reckon it's probably the same rough odds as probably winning the lottery'. The fake directors they use nearly always live in far-flung places and only pretend to control the businesses, an illegal act that the UK Government said they had crushed decades ago. These arrangements, found by the BBC in a joint sting with the Guardian . and the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative . Journalists, make sure it is sufficiently complicated to ensure HMRC struggle to trace the cash and allows rich individuals to conceal their assets. Scam: A web of thousands of companies fronted by sham directors has been uncovered, which keeps millions in tax from the Treasury (pictured) Nominee directors are not illegal as long as they are involved in the running of the business and know what the company is doing. Therefore these sham managers are not allowed. Conspiracy: Expert Jonathan Fisher QC said if the system is being used in this way then it is clearly criminal . White collar crime expert Jonathan Fisher QC said the system breaks the law. 'If this proceeded and the company was set up and it was set up in the way in which it is being discussed, then plainly some very serious criminal offences would be committed,' he said. After the sting James Turner denied any wrongdoing and Turner Little said it takes its responsibilities seriously, launching an internal investigation. The controversial evasion technique became famous in the 1990s when it was used in the Channel Islands - known as the 'Sark Lark - before it was stamped out by the then Tory government. One person was found to be the directors of at least 1,300 companies and the 600 people who lived there held 15,000 directorships. This has all but disappeared on the island after the law was changed but now it appears that it has returned in strength around the globe. Former Met Police Detective Superintendent Tristram Hicks, an expert on money laundering, said: 'What I'm shocked by, and concerned by, is the apparent ease with which you've discovered these people.' HMRC say that most of these 2,000-plus corporate service providers operate legally but admitted that they have never prosecuted anyone for setting up a system to help evade tax or launder money in this way.

Police are treating both deaths as 'unexplained' Detectives immediately called in scenes of crime specialists, and said that they were unsure whether anyone else was involved in the couple's deaths as all the doors to their home were locked. A spokesman said that police were treating the deaths as 'unexplained' as they could not be sure whether whether they died accidentally, from natural causes or as the result of a crime. Mr Ziemba was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for his injuries but died last night, Thames Valley Police said.

The former treasurer of Northern Rock has been found dead at his home after it is believed he spiralled into depression over his role in the bank’s collapse. Keith Currie, 56, stepped down just two months after the bank went bust in 2007 and later retired with a reported £2.5million payout. Friends say he was haunted by the bank’s collapse and could not forgive himself for failing to ensure the business had enough financing to survive. It is believed he became a recluse and began drinking. He also suffered a marriage collapse earlier this year. Police today confirmed the father-of-one had been found dead at his home in Jesmond, Newcastle, at around 3pm on Sunday. A close friend, who asked not to be named, said Mr Currie felt 'terrible' about ordinary people losing their money. He said: 'He was a very charitable chap. He was just a really nice, very happy-go-lucky sort of guy. 'When Northern Rock went down he became quite reclusive. He did not go out. He was a guy with a conscience. 'He felt terrible about customers and shareholders losing their money.' The friend added: 'He started to fall into depression'. Mr Currie was appointed treasury manager of Northern Rock in January . 2005 and played a key role in ensuring the bank had enough financing. But just a month after Northern Rock crashed in September 2007 Mr . Currie was notably absent from work for two weeks, citing stress. He stepped down as a board director in November 2007 and took early . retirement in January 2008 - after pocketing a reported £2.5million in bonus . pay-outs. Northern Rock’s shares collapsed after it was forced to seek emergency funding from the Bank of England. Concerned customers rushed to withdraw their money and the share price plunged 30 per cent. Mr Currie was criticised along with other executives for selling . shares in the bank months before its financial crisis. Collapse: The fall of Northern Rock in 2007 shocked Britain and led to a rush by customers to remove their money from the toxic institution . A 2009 Channel 4 Dispatches investigation into banking chiefs’ bonuses found Mr Currie had received payments totalling £2.5million. The friend added; 'He had everything going for him. He was a nice bloke, with a good sense of humour.' 'From what I understand one of his friends was trying to get hold of him and that is when they realised something was wrong,' they added. A spokesman for Northumbria Police yesterday said: 'At 3.12pm Northumbria Police received a report from the ambulance service of a man found dead at his house on Lindisfarne Road in Jesmond. 'The man was in his 50s. The coroner has been informed.' A post mortem is expected to take place on Wednesday. Mr Currie is understood to have broken up from his wife Fiona Currie, 52, earlier this year after ten years of marriage. He is known to have previously been married and has one son, Angus, 19. A spokesman for Virgin Money today said: 'We are very sad to hear the news of Keith's passing.' Northern Rock was caught up in the US sub-prime lending crisis and was forced to apply to the Bank of England for emergency financial support in September 2007. Worried savers queued up around the bank's 76 branches to withdraw savings - totalling up to £2.5billion - causing the share price to plunge by 30 per cent. On September 17, 2007, the then Chancellor Alistair Darling stepped in and guaranteed all Northern Rock deposits in a bid to restore confidence in the bank. Northern Rock executives appeared before a Parliamentary committee into the crisis October 16, 2007, and three days later chairman Matt Ridley resigned. On November 17, 2007, the chief executive Adam Applegarth resigned along with board directors David Baker, Keith Currie and Andy Kuipers who stood down but remained as officers. The Chancellor announced on February 17, 2008, that Northern Rock would be taken into public ownership. The bank was later split in two with the 'good' bank being sold to Virgin Money for £747million on November 17, 2011. It is estimated the sale saw taxpayers with a 'paper' loss of between £400million and ££650million.","Keith Currie died on Sunday at his home in Jesmond, Newcastle .

But homeowner Andy Ford held back 2ft of flood water by sealing his property with plasticine. The 32-year-old was bestowed the advice by his neighbour Tad Mandziej, who successfully protected his own home from gushing torrents using the modelling clay. Tad Mandziej, 70, from Williton, with the plasticine he used to save his neighbour's house from flooding after protecting his own home using the material . Mr Ford was horrified when a torrent breached flood gates at his 17th century cottage in Williton, Somerset. After Mr Mandziej's suggestion of clay, . Mr Ford sealed the doors before fleeing through a window. When he returned home the next day he was delighted to find just a few inches of water on the ground - compared to 2ft in neighbouring homes. Mr Ford, an account manager for cheese producer Cricketer Farm, said: 'Our house was flooded 12 years ago and so the old owner had flood gates installed. 'But the water began coming over the top of them, which was horrific. 'I was outside my home wondering what I could do when my neighbour Tad came over with a sack of plasticine. Sticky situation: Mr Mandziej holding the trusty clay which has prevented two houses being submerged in flood waters . 'The water was already up to my knees around the back of the house, around 18 inches deep. I quickly put the plasticine around the back porch and door frame. 'I then used it to plug gaps in the flood gates, even though it was raining, and our front door too. 'It definitely contributed to us not getting flooded like a lot of our neighbours. They had a couple of feet.' Mr Ford and wife Emma, 30, who works part time in insurance, moved into their picturesque two-bedroomed home three years ago. The area regularly floods in heavy rain and so many of the properties have flood gates installed outside. The two families in Williton, West Somerset, sealed the windows and doors with the plasticine . Mr Mandziej, 70, his neighbour who brought over the sack of commercial plasticine for professional model makers, said: 'We have a very old house and outside we have air bricks and in order to stop the water getting in I just make a sheet of the plasticine and then put it around them. 'It is incredible how water tight it is. It just fills the gaps. 'I passed some to Andy after I had done my house because I saw him flailing around and complaining the water was seeping through into his house. 'I told him to try the plasticine and he did and it stopped seeping in. He pushed it in between the cracks and it stopped the water. 'We have a problem in the sense that we are very susceptible to the water just tanking up, the flood waters just stops there and doesn’t move. 'This is the third flooding I have experienced, I didn’t use the plasticine the first time but I did the last time and it worked. 'So when I saw this guy getting frantic the idea flashed back into my head.' Water began pouring into the couple's home at around midnight on Saturday, following hours of torrential rain that battered the South West. They fled the property with 16-month-old daughter Elizabeth after Andy sealed the door and gates. The family are currently staying at Emma’s parents nearby as dehumidifiers dry out out their home. Mr Ford added: 'Hopefully the damage won’t be too bad. I would never have thought of the plasticine before but it was a great idea, it certainly helped.'","Andy Ford held back 2ft of flood water by sealing his 17th century cottage .

Imagine the come- down when you go from being the fastest thing on two wheels at the Olympics to being the most wooden thing on two legs on Strictly. She must be one of the fittest women in the world so why she dances like she’s on the NHS waiting list for a hip replacement is a complete mystery. After turning in a horribly stiff and awkward salsa on Saturday Victoria found herself, deservedly, bottom of the leader board with only 21 out of 40. Victoria Pendleton, pictured with partner Brendan Cole, was Strictly's biggest signing of the year . 'Really something': Victoria put on an awkward and stiff salsa for her final dance . Victoria must be dehydrated after all the tears she has shed on the show . ‘Well, that was really something,’ said Brucie after her performance. That ‘something’ being a complete car crash. Her hideous baby-pink satin dress and Aunt Sally make-up didn’t exactly help matters either. When Craig Revel Horwood told Victoria that the stage props had more fluidity than she did and awarded her a 4 it led to another mini-meltdown. It was no surprise when she ended up in the dance-off alongside Michael Vaughan before being voted off last night. Perhaps it’s just as well that the judges sent her packing – Victoria has spent so much of the past two months sobbing she must be dangerously dehydrated by now. But, even though she couldn’t dance, she was Strictly’s biggest signing this year and it’s a shame to see her go – not least because wondering how Len will get another cycling pun into his critique had become compulsive viewing. At the other end of the scale is Denise Van Outen who, unless her partner James continues to drop her on her head as he has been doing in rehearsal, is dancing all the way to the final. For the second week running she topped the leader board, scoring 37 out of 40 for her elegant, flowing American Smooth. She even got a 10 from Bruno, which seemed a tad OTT considering Denise herself admitted that she went wrong – but then nonsensical marking was the order of the day on Saturday’s show. Michael Vaughan just stood there and thought of England as Natalie Lowe gyrated around him . Of course, Denise’s participation continues to cause controversy due to the fact she was a fantastic dancer from week one rather than a ropey one who got better with every week. It could be worse though, she could be dazzlingly brilliant one week yet so awful you have to watch through your fingers the next – like Michael Vaughan. While Michael is a natural at ballroom he just can’t find his dancing feet with the more passionate, upbeat numbers. On Saturday he did an Argentine Tango – a dance that’s meant to be full of jumps, kicks and flicks but during which he just stood rooted to the spot while his partner Natalie used him like a human pole as she posed and gyrated around him. Meanwhile fellow Olympian Louis came in . for a right old rollicking from the judges for his Paso Doble. I hate it . when they criticise Louis, his big, puppy-dog eyes fill with tears and . you can see him swallowing hard so he doesn’t lose control of his . emotions. Leave him alone! In keeping with the judge’s skew-whiff scoring, Nicky Byrne was praised to the rafters and given 36 for a Charleston even though he was out of sync with his partner for most of the routine. After ending up in the bottom two at Wembley Nicky played the kiddie card and had his very photogenic children visit him at rehearsals. He also threw in a couple of their cute cousins for good measure. Well played Nicky. With half the contestants now gone the battle is really on and if Michael’s three children don’t decide to ‘spontaneously’ drop in on their daddy in rehearsals next Saturday I’ll be very surprised.","CLAUDIA CONNELL: VIEW FROM THE SOFA .

The 53-year-old revealed an unsightly series of chins as he took a spin in his Ferrari over the weekend. It was a far cry from earlier in the . year, when he looked considerably firmer around the face – but the music . mogul was showing the signs of a saggy jawline in an appearance on . American TV last month. Larger than life: A fuller-faced Simon Cowell was photographed while taking a friend for a spin past his three Beverly Hills homes in his Ferrari 458 Italia Spyder . Cowell has endured a tough few months . as ratings for his UK X Factor show have slumped to their lowest ever . levels. On Saturday, the ITV1 programme drew an average of just eight . million viewers. In 2010, it typically attracted 13.6million. For the fourth week in a row, it was beaten by BBC1 rival Strictly Come Dancing, which was watched by 10.3million. Sinitta, Cowell’s close friend and ex-girlfriend, said the current run has been the 'worst series ever'. She told The People: ‘Simon says X . Factor is his first baby. He worries about the show and there is a lot . for him to worry about at the moment. Spot the difference: Cowell looked slimmer in March, left, but by October was seen on TV looking puffed up . ‘He has so much affection for the UK show, he is the boss and he wants to be back on UK TV. Disappointed: Simon was annoyed to see Ella Henderson axed from the competition . ‘The wrong people are going. He finds it frustrating. He doesn’t want the whole thing to fall apart.’ A spokesperson for Simon Cowell said: 'On a series like this, there are good and not-so-good years. ‘Certainly, Simon has been disappointed to lose some of the contestants, including Ella. 'However, The X Factor is a very . unpredictable show and Simon is a great believer in the British public. There must have been something in her performance last week that did not . chime for whatever reason. 'It is no secret he has missed . working on the UK show and he has not ruled out returning to the show as . a possibility in the future.' Cowell has always denied having cosmetic surgery, but has been remarkably candid about his Botox use. He once compared the wrinkle-smoothing injections to brushing his teeth, confessing: ‘Of course I have had it. I mean, for me, it’s like cleaning my teeth, you know? Something makes your teeth whiter or something stops you having lines.’ He added: 'I think you’ve got to be very careful as a guy, in particular, that you can end up looking really, really weird.'","BBC One show won the ratings battle on Saturday by more than 2 million .

Prince Charles, the longest-waiting heir to the throne in British history, has spoken of his 'impatience' to get things done. Joking about the vigour with which he pursues his pet projects, he declared: 'Impatient? Me? What a thing to suggest! Yes, of course I am.' He added: 'I'll run out of time soon. I shall have snuffed it if I'm not careful.' Charles was speaking a few days before his 64th birthday during a visit to Dumfries House, a stately home in East Ayrshire he has helped save for the nation. The comments, which were recorded for a film on the Clarence House website, were in the context of his involvement with Dumfries House. But they will fuel speculation that the Prince is more eager than ever to take the throne. In 2008, he became the longest-waiting heir in British history, overtaking his great-great grandfather Edward VII. Courtiers insist Charles is fulfilled by his present role as one of the hardest-working members of the royal family, undertaking hundreds of charitable engagements a year. But many royal commentators have suggested he feels frustrated his reign has not yet begun. With a history of longevity in his family – the Queen is 86 and in good health while the Queen Mother lived to 101 – Charles may have some time to wait until he succeeds his mother. He has nothing but praise for the way the Queen has led her country  for 60 years. But he has previously hinted at his impatience with the long wait for succession. In 1992, when his then-brother-in-law Charles Spencer became Earl Spencer on the death of his father, Charles told him: 'You are fortunate enough to have succeeded to the title when still young.' Scroll down for video . Prince Charles helped to purchase Dumfries House and its priceless contents for 45million . In 2004, after a Guards officer  congratulated him on his 56th birthday, the Prince is reported to have said: 'I'm now at the age at which my grandfather died.' Professor Robert Hazell, director of University College London's constitution unit, said Charles had to fit a unique job description. 'He is an age when most people are starting to contemplate retirement, yet he's not actually started the job he has spent  his adult life preparing for. That is burdensome.' Royal biographer Penny Junor said: 'He is impatient, but when he becomes king, his activities and all the projects he most enjoys where he can make a difference will be seriously curtailed.'","Prince declares: 'Impatient?

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 20:57 EST, 25 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:48 EST, 26 November 2012 . Punishment: Stalkers now face up to five years in jail . Stalking yesterday became a crime punishable by up to five years in prison. Two new offences aim to close a gap in the law that has allowed those who target, follow and threaten others to escape arrest or punishment. Under a new law, those who harass others by following or spying on them can be jailed for up to six months. A second new offence means those who cause their target to fear violence or make them change the way they live can be imprisoned for up to five years. Home Secretary Theresa May said that stalking is a ‘sickening and cowardly’ crime. ‘One in six women has been a victim of stalking,’ she added. ‘Too many women live in fear, forced to look constantly over their shoulder. We need to end their suffering. Earlier criminal law, including harassment offences largely introduced under the last Labour government, covered tactics used by stalkers but left it possible for stalkers to target victims without committing an offence. The Home Office said that ‘adding specific offences of stalking will provide greater clarity around this offence for the police and others looking to improve the safety of victims and bring perpetrators to justice.’ Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne said: 'This is a very serious problem which affects thousands of thousands of mainly women, not exclusively women, but mainly women, right across the country. 'It is the sort of offence that people can sometimes brush under the carpet, not be aware of, it has been trivialised sometimes in the past as something which is just people, mainly women, being a bit bothered but nothing to worry about too much,' he told BBC Breakfast. 'We are saying it is a serious offence, it is a specific offence, we want people to be aware of it.' The new offences bring English law into line with Scotland where stalking has been an offence in itself for two years. An inquiry by MPs earlier this year estimated that 120,000 people are stalked each year but in fewer than half of these cases do police record that a crime has been committed. A stalker is jailed over one in 50 of these incidents, their report said. Theresa May spoke of Rana Qruqui who was stalked by her boyfriend who stabbed her to death . Stalking cases have been highlighted by a number of incidents that have ended in murder. In one 49-year-old Clifford Mills stalked his former girlfriend Lorna Smith on Facebook before stabbing her to death at his flat in Brixton, south London, in February last year. Mills was jailed in February for life, with a minimum term of 21 years, after being found guilty of murder. Mrs May spoke yesterday of the case of Rana Faruqui, a 35-year-old business analyst and prominent horsewoman who was stalked by a former boyfriend. Stephen Griffiths followed and spied on her, and cut the brake pipes of her car. Thames Valley police took no action, until Miss Faruqui was stabbed to death in a field in 2003. Griffiths was later sentenced to life for murder, and Miss Faruqui’s mother Carol became a campaigner for tougher laws on stalking. The Home Secretary said yesterday: ‘Carol was determined to campaign for the victims of stalking and talking to her made me realise the full horror of stalking. I am determined to do all I can to stop more women suffering Rana’s fate. Sadly her case is not a one-off.’ The new laws, introduced under the wide-ranging Protection of Freedoms Act, came into force yesterday.","Theresa May: Stalking is 'sickening and cowardly' crime .

In a letter congratulating the Terrence Higgins Trust on its 30th anniversary, they called on a generation to ‘pick up the sword and continue the fight’ against HIV. Their mother Diana, Princess of Wales, fostered close ties with HIV charities, and opened the first specialist Aids hospital ward in England at Middlesex Hospital. ‘Our generation has never known a world without HIV,’ William and Harry wrote. ‘We have grown up knowing of the devastating impact this virus has on lives, on families, on communities. ‘We know, too, that HIV can be treated and the lives of sufferers extended by many years. However, there is still a stigma which blights sufferers of the disease, even today. ‘Our generation must pick up the sword and continue the fight. There is still no cure or vaccine. However, we know it is possible to prevent HIV from spreading further in the future. ‘Terrence Higgins Trust will be to the fore in this, and for that reason, and because our mother believed so passionately in the work of the trust, we wholeheartedly congratulate you on 30 years of selfless service to others.’ A photograph of William and Harry with Diana, by John Swannell, will go under the hammer at the charity’s 30th anniversary auction at Christie’s on March 21. Terry Higgins died of an Aids-related illness in London in 1982, aged 37. That year, three of his friends founded the charity in his name. It is now the UK’s largest HIV and sexual health charity. Its chief executive, Sir Nick Partridge, said: ‘We are incredibly honoured to have this message of support from their Royal Highnesses. ‘It’s wonderful to see the princes inspiring their generation... the way their mother inspired mine.’ Princes William and Harry pictured raising money for Sentebale - a charity set up by Prince Harry partly to help HIV victims in Botswana .","Princes support Terrence Higgins Trust in letter on its 30th anniversary .

Predator: Jean Alexis was given an indeterminate sentence after he preyed on three women on the rail network . A rapist who preyed on women on the rail network in a series of random attacks has been jailed for an indeterminate period. Jean Alexis, 26, denied six different charges, including rape, sexual assault and theft in relation to the offences involving three women. Following a trial earlier this year, he was convicted by a jury on Friday and handed an indeterminate jail sentence at Luton Crown Court. He will spend a minimum of five years in prison, British Transport Police (BTP) said. Alexis carried out three attacks in Harlington, . Leagrave and Luton, Bedfordshire, in October and December last year and . February this year. The court heard how Alexis, of The Ridings, Luton, dragged an 18-year-old woman into a train toilet and raped her. Alexis had met the woman near Luton station before boarding the train with her and attacking her on December 15. He also followed an off-duty police officer from a train to her car at Leagrave station where he made threats towards her. He also made sexual advances and inappropriately touched a 19-year-old woman on a St Pancras-bound train. An investigation was launched by BTP’s Major Investigation Unit and, after hours of CCTV was viewed and forensic DNA examinations carried out, Alexis was identified. He was arrested a week later by BTP and Bedfordshire Police officers at his home address. As part of his sentence he has also been placed on the sex offenders’ register for ten years and was recommended for deportation following his jail term, a BTP spokesman said. Speaking after sentencing, Detective Inspector Ian Trantum, BTP’s senior investigating officer, praised the victims for their courage and bravery in coming forward to police. He added: 'Alexis preyed on lone women travelling on the rail network in the early hours and his behaviour and actions were something no one should be subjected to. Attack: Alexis met a 18-year-old woman near Luton station before boarding the train and dragging her into the onboard toilets where he raped her (file picture) 'What each victim had to endure is unthinkable and Alexis is now where he belongs for this despicable act - behind bars. 'Despite pleading not guilty, the overwhelming evidence helped the jury in their unanimous decision. 'This sentence highlights the severity with which crimes like this are treated. BTP takes all allegations of sexual offences extremely seriously and will always seek to catch and prosecute those responsible.' Baljit Ubhey, chief Crown prosecutor for Thames and Chiltern Crown Prosecution Service, branded Alexis a 'predatory and dangerous individual'.

If you are lucky enough to reach the age of 91, you'd be forgiven for wanting to put your feet up in front of the television. But for one 91-year-old pensioner, that's not enough and he likes to do something a little 'extra' with his time. Donald McMaster, 91, is Britain's oldest extra and regularly appears in television series. He has a long list of credits including Still Game, Chewin’ The Fat, Taggart and The High Road - and regularly appears in BBC drama River City in his native Scotland. And, great-grandfather Mr McMaster, from Faifley, has no intention of retiring anytime soon. He said: ‘I’m only 91, for goodness sake. I really enjoy it and it can be quite lucrative. ‘Sometimes I get a full week’s work and I have been all over the country for different things.’ Mr McMaster's first taste of acting started before the Second World War when he entertained troops at army camps. After the war he was working as a photographer when he got his lucky break. On his way home one night, he saw people filming in a garage, and went in to ask what was going on. He was told that they were filming for a BBC show. He said: ‘I decided I should try to get into that and I contacted the Equity, the trade union for arts performers, and they said I could get a stint as an extra for the theatre. ‘I ended up getting an agent and he was soon phoning me up with all sorts of TV work.’ Since then, Mr McMaster has become a memorable face in the background of many shows, starring as a lawyer, a soldier, a minister and a policeman. A little extra something: Mr McMaster (right) as a vicar in Taggart in 2002. The 91-year-old has no intention of retiring . Lights, camera, action! Mr McMaster as a vicar in Taggart in 2002. He has been an extra for since the 1960s . He has even appeared in films like A Shot At Glory, which starred Robert Duvall, and Kidnapped alongside Michael Caine. Despite not having a leading role, or even speaking, Mr McMaster still makes money from old shows and has even been stopped in the street by people who recognise him from the television. He said: ‘I’m actually still getting royalties from Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy - it isn’t much but it gets shown all over the world. ‘I was getting petrol one day and someone came up to me and said he had saw me in an episode of Taggart in Australia which is absolutely incredible. It gets around.’ Despite his advancing age, Donald has no intentions of completely giving up his roles but admits he has had to cut back on appearances.

Here he is pictured with with Robert Duvall (left) on the set of A shot at Glory in 2001 . He still features regularly on BBC soap River City and gets a wide variety of other offers from all over the country. Mr McMaster said: ‘I think I’m the oldest extra still working. I know a couple of other older actors but they are only in the 80s. ‘I’m going on 92, so I am getting on a bit now. I am not doing as much as I used to. ‘The way I am now, I wouldn’t take on much work, even though I still get lots of offers. ‘I was recently asked to do a stint for a Scottish Gas advert in Aberdeen but I couldn’t make it.’ Mr McMaster (right) with a fellow extra on the set of Kidnapped staring Michael Caine in 1971 . ‘I still do the odd bits and bobs but River City is quite handy as it’s only 15 minutes from my house by car.’ Lottie Goodwin was previously Britain’s oldest extra and appeared in Emmerdale until retiring in April 2011 aged 99.

TV star Anna Ryder Richardson's zoo has been fined £70,000 over serious health and safety breaches following an incident which saw a mother and her young toddler hit by a falling tree. Swansea Crown Court was told the celebrity interior designer and her husband and co-owner Colin MacDougall knew there were dangerous trees at their zoo in west Wales but had 'closed their eyes to the risk'. The court heard Ms Ryder Richardson has ploughed up to £1million of her own money into Manor House Wildlife Park near Tenby, and is living with her family in a wooden hut within its grounds due to the venture's 'precarious' financial position. 'Risks': Anna Ryder Richardson and her husband Colin MacDougall outside Swansea Crown Court today . Emma Davies-Hughes, 30, and her three-year-old son Gruff were crushed by a falling tree while visiting the wallaby enclosure at the wildlife park. Teacher Emma Davies-Hughes and her three-year-old son Gruff were injured by a falling tree at the zoo in Wales . Ryder Richardson's company, Manor House Wildlife, admitted two breaches of the Health and Safety at Work Act. MacDougall, 46, pleaded guilty to similar charges. The company was fined £70,000, MacDougall was fined £4,000, and the couple must pay £37,500 in legal costs. Judge Paul Thomas QC said: 'The defendants fell significantly below the required standards of safety - nothing effective was done to reduce those risks.' The court was told the charges were not directly related to the injuries of Gruff and his mother. It heard it was not possible to say the accident would not have happened even if a safety system had been in place. Swansea Crown Court heard Ryder Richardson, 48, had poured up to £1million of her own money into the venture in Pembrokeshire, west Wales. But the TV presenter and her husband were living in a wooden hut at the zoo after poor weather hit visitor numbers leaving them in a 'precarious' financial position. Teacher Emma Davies-Hughes, 30, and her son Gruff, three, were petting the animals in a wallaby enclosure when the tree fell on top of them. Gruff was left fighting for his life after the tree hit him on the head and had to spend three days in intensive care. His mother suffered injuries to her head leg, pelvis and arm. Prosecutor Simon Morgan said: 'Gruff and his mother went to stroke one of the wallabies. 'Mrs Davies-Hughes did not see the tree falling and she was covered by branches and foliage when it hit her and the toddler.' The court heard trained medic Aled Lewis who was visiting the park managed to bring Gruff back to life using heart massage. He also revived Mrs Davies-Hughes who was knocked unconscious. Both mother and son are still suffering from the devastating effects of the accident two years ago, a solicitor for the family said. The celebrity interior designer and her family are living in a cabin within the grounds of Manor House Wildlife Park, Swansea Crown Court heard . Ryder Richardson's company failed to act on reports that trees in the park were decayed and a 'high risk', the court was told. Mr Morgan said: 'This company was . guilty of significant failure in its obligation to the paying public . including vulnerable individuals. 'Being in that environment was unsafe and the company knew it and closed its eyes to this,' he said. Judge Paul Thomas was scathing in his condemnation of MacDougall's attitude in the wake of the incident. He said a refusal to close the attraction had seen Pembrokeshire County Council act to order it closed on safety grounds. In the 48 hours after the event, five potentially dangerous trees were felled in the enclosure where it happened. He also highlighted surveys of which MacDougall was aware, and failed to act on, identifying potentially dangerous trees. Earlier, the court heard that the guilty pleas were accepted on the basis that there was no causal link to the incident. But the judge questioned why MacDougall failed to act on surveys from an expert who advised action on a number of trees and warned that risk assessments were needed if new areas were opened to the public. He said he believed MacDougall was 'shopping around to try to save money'. 'In my view, procrastination and fudge best seem to sum up the views at this stage,' he said. He added: 'The defendant, in my view, fell very significantly below the proper standard.' 'Procrastination and fudge': The judge said Colin MacDougall, seen with wife Anna Ryder Richardson outside court, failed to act on surveys from an expert who advised action on a number of trees at the wildlife park . The court was told Ryder Richardson had made the zoo her 'life's work' after she opened it four years ago. Christian Du Cann, defending, said: 'The accident cast a pall over the park and it is a matter of regret that it happened. 'The wildlife park has been their . life's work and they are held in high regard in zoological circles in . allowing visitors to view endangered animals.' Nicholas Collins, solicitor for the . Davies-Hughes family, said after the case: 'The family continues to live . with the devastating effects of the accident on a daily basis.' After the hearing the couple said in a statement: 'Our primary concerns have been for Gruff and his mother and we are glad they are making a recovery. 'Our thoughts and best wishes are with them. 'Our tree management system could and should have been better.' Pembrokeshire Council welcomed the heavy financial penalties on the company. A spokesman said: 'These sentences reflect the fact that the park and Colin McDougall have failed over a number of years to manage the risks posed to the paying pubic and employees. 'There was a failure to assess and actively manage the tree population to ensure the park was safe. 'These failures created the . environment in which a 25-metre beech tree fell trapping and seriously . injuring a child and his mother.'","Zoo owned by celebrity interior designer and her husband fined over serious health and safety breaches .

Born when Gladstone was Prime Minister, Thomas the tortoise has survived everything since 1882, even Nazi bombs. But Thomas, now Britain’s oldest resident, hid a secret under its shell for most of those 130 years – being a female. The tortoise was pulled from the rubble of a bomb-hit house in Essex in 1945. But it was only when owner June Le Gallez of Guernsey inherited Thomas in 1978 that a vet found the truth, after 96 years. Identity crisis: Thomas is 130 years old and was only discovered to be a girl after 96 years . ‘People suggested I rename him Tomasina, . but I thought it would be cruel to change it,’ said Mrs Le Gallez, 54, . adding: ‘She isn’t slowing down. People can’t believe how active she . is.’ Mrs Le Gallez, 54, who cares for the reptile at her home on the . Channel Island of Guernsey, added: ‘Thomas is very much part of the . family. I have pictures with her when I was as young as two. 'Because she is so old we thought we would have lost her by now but she is tough. I sometimes wonder if she will outlive me. ‘She’s always been very big for her age. ‘Thomas used to live and run in the garden when she was younger but now we keep her in the house and she bumbles around. ‘She is just a massive part of the family and everyone is very fond of her. ‘She really races around when she wants to. She’s really fast.’ Mrs Le Gallez inherited Thomas from her cousin Grace Hilditch in 1978. Ms Hilditch had been given Thomas in 1922 as a present from her father Harry, who was friends with a reptile keeper at London Zoo. Healthy diet: Could the secret to Thomas's long life be her love of bananas? When they adopted Thomas the keeper informed Harry she was 40 years old putting her birth date at 1882. Thomas lived happily with Ms Hilditch for 56 years at her home in Ilford, Essex, which was bombed in 1945 and a warden managed to rescue her from the rubble. She was given to Mrs Le Gallez and husband Richard after Ms Hilditch had fallen ill and later died. June said: ‘The journey from Essex to Guernsey with Thomas was a rather funny one. ‘Staff on the train asked me if I wanted anything to eat and drink and if Thomas wanted any lettuce leaves.’ Thomas is kept company in the garden by fellow tortoises Gorky and Carstaias, who are both 50 years old, and her favourite food is bananas. The oldest recorded tortoise in Britain was Timmy, a Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise who was believed to be 160 years old when she died in 2004 at Powderham Castle, Devon. David Alderton, Editor of Practical Reptile Keeping magazine said: ‘Although many people have contacted us about tortoises over 50 years old, some of which they’ve had since childhood, we’ve only heard to date of two individuals who are more than 100 years old.’","The tortoise was pulled from a bomb-hit house in Essex in 1945 .

British aid to Rwanda is ‘funding a dictator’ and worsening the misery of his victims, a former senior aide to the African state’s president claimed last night. The £270million of aid earmarked for the  country over the next three years is ‘sustaining a bad regime’, said David Himbara, who was private secretary to President Paul Kagame until two years ago. Kagame’s regime is alleged to be funding and arming a bloody rebellion in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, in a conflict  marked by the use of child soldiers and widespread rape and murder. 'Dictator': Rwandan President Paul Kagame's regime is alleged to be arming a bloody rebellion in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo . One Rwandan defence minister has even been said to be co-ordinating military operations inside Congo. Mr Himbara’s claims throw new doubt over the wisdom of the Coalition’s commitment to foreign aid. The multi-billion-pound budget is rising every year and is ring-fenced, but the commitment by David Cameron to development as a core principle has come under widespread criticism. Britain has promised aid for President Kagame at a rate of more than £80million a year until 2015. Payments were suspended in the summer because of concerns over the Congo conflict. However, former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell – who developed a close friendship with President Kagame – allowed a £16million package to be handed over on his last day in office before being replaced in the September reshuffle. Next month, his replacement, Justine Greening, will have to decide whether to resume the aid or freeze it indefinitely in the light of a UN Security Council report  into the rebellion by the M23 movement in Congo, which accused Rwanda of funding the rebels. Mr Himbara fled to South Africa after falling out with President Kagame, and it is feared his name is on an assassination list drawn up in Rwanda. 'Invest in success': David Cameron shakes hands with President Kagame at a meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, in 2007 . Speaking to Channel 4’s Dispatches programme, Mr Himbara said: ‘Britain is not funding Rwanda. It is funding a dictator. Let no British taxpayer flatter herself or himself that they are helping Rwanda. No, you are merely extending their misery.’ 'Britain is not funding Rwanda. It is funding a dictator' Former presidential aide David Himbara . He added: The United Kingdom’s aid to Rwanda is misplaced. It’s wrong. It cannot be justified. How do you hold people accountable where there is no media, where there is no opposition party, where parliament is answerable to one man?’ Mr Himbara challenged claims that British aid buys diplomatic influence in Kigali, the Rwandan capital. ‘What leverage would that be?’ he asked. ‘It has not stopped Kagame going into Congo.‘We have never seen UK say anything about Rwanda, no matter what it does. There is no evidence. The UK just gives blank cheques, it seems to me.’ Funding from London to Rwanda has doubled since Mr Cameron’s Coalition came to power, in the hope of rebuilding a country still recovering from the effects of the genocide in which 800,000 people were killed in 1994. One pound out of every £20 spent by the Rwandan government is British aid money, for which President Kagame is supposed to reciprocate by protecting human rights, promoting democracy, and working for peace. However, Dispatches said that despite repeated requests, British aid officials in Rwanda were unable to provide the programme with specific examples of projects funded by the money. Conflict: A Congolese policeman attempts to stop people entering a base where UNICEF and International Medical Corps workers were handing out high nutrition cookies north of Goma in 2008 . Last month, Mr Cameron defended the decision to unfreeze the latest £16million tranche of aid. He said: ‘I am clear, Rwanda has been, and continues to be,  a success story of a country that has gone from genocide and disaster to being a role model for development and lifting people out of poverty in Africa. ‘I am proud of the fact that the last government, and this government, have continued to invest in that success.’ British aid has now been suspended again after publication of the UN Security Council report. Both Foreign Secretary William Hague and Miss Greening, have said it contains ‘credible and compelling’ evidence of Kagame’s support for the rebels. M23 began operations in Congo in the spring. Its attack on Goma is described in the country as the ‘Rwandan occupation’. The city of Goma, which lies on the border with Rwanda, has been captured by M23 forces. Half a million people are said to have been displaced. The rebel movement is led by General Bosco Ntaganda, who has  been nicknamed ‘the Terminator’. Ntaganda has been accused of kidnapping children for use as child soldiers, and his rebels are said to have committed widespread rape and murder. Former Secretary of State Mr Mitchell told MPs earlier this month that his decision to restore aid was ‘made with complete propriety’. He said he took ‘great offence’ at media portrayals of him as a ‘rogue minister who signed cheques under the bedclothes and bunged them to dubious regimes’.","President Paul Kagame's former private secretary said £270million of aid earmarked for Rwanda is 'sustaining a bad regime'

North Korea's new leader gave his first public speech Sunday since taking power, portraying himself as a strong military chief unafraid of foreign powers as the army showed off what appeared to be a new long-range missile. Kim Jong Un's lengthy speech - two days after North Korea launched a long-range rocket in defiance of international warnings - took North Koreans gathered at Kim Il Sung Square and before televisions across the country by surprise. His father, late leader Kim Jong Il, addressed the public only once during his lifetime. Calm and measured, Kim Jong Un covered a wide range of topics, from foreign policy to the economy, as he spoke during choreographed festivities honoring the 100th birthday of his late grandfather, North Korea founder Kim Il Sung. The rocket unveiled on Sunday, which appeared to have several stages, was similar to the one that broke into pieces over the Yellow Sea shortly after liftoff Friday, but was of a more overtly military design. Address: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un speaks during a mass parade to celebrate founder Kim Il Sung's 100th birthday in Pyongyang on Sunday . Uniform: North Korean female soldiers attend a mass military parade in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square to celebrate 100 years since the birth of the North Korean founder Kim Il Sung . While it's not clear how powerful or . significant this addition to the North Korean arsenal is - or whether it . was a mock-up - it signaled that North Korea will continue to build up . its military despite the failed launch. Although that launch was a huge, . costly embarrassment, Kim's address Sunday was seen by analysts as an . expression of confidence by the young leader meant to show that he is . firmly in control. Kim Jong Un's words often mirrored . what North Korea regularly says in its state media, but there was . symbolism in the images of the new leader, who is believed to be in his . late 20s, addressing the country on state TV and then watching - and . often laughing and gesturing in relaxed conversation with senior . officials - as a parade of North Korean military troops and hardware . marched by. Outside analysts have raised worries . about how the new leader, who has been seen but not publicly heard since . taking over after Kim Jong Il's December death, would govern a country . that is building a nuclear weapons program and has previously threatened . Seoul and Washington with war. Preparing to speak: Kim Jong Un claps and smiles before giving his first public . address as tens of thousands gathered in Pyongyang's main square for . meticulously choreographed festivities . In honour: Kim Jong Un, centre, waves to crowds today during the celebrations to mark the centenary of the birth of his grandfather, the founder of the world's only Stalinist monarchy, 'Eternal President' Kim Il Sung . The speech was a good 'first . impression for his people and for the world,' said Hajime Izumi, a North . Korea expert at Japan's Shizuoka University. 'He demonstrated that he . can speak in public fairly well, and at this stage that in itself - more . than what he actually said - is important. I think we might be seeing . him speak in public more often, and show a different style than his . father.' Kim emphasized in his speech the . importance of strengthening North Korea's defenses by placing the . country's 'first, second and third' priorities on military might. However, he also made clear he is open to working with foreign countries . that do not have hostile policies toward his nation, and said he would . strive to reunify Korea. 'It's a heartbreaking fact that our . nation has been divided for more than 70 years,' he said. 'I will make . painstaking efforts toward reunification.'

Great strides forward: Female sailors and soldiers hold machine guns during the military procession today . Kim also stressed the importance of . national unity, calling his country 'Kim Il Sung's Korea' rather than . North Korea. In recent days, the square bearing his grandfather's name . has been redecorated, with the Marx and Lenin portraits that adorned key . buildings taken down and replaced with long red banners vowing to . defend the new leader 'to the death.' At the front are portraits of the . two late leaders, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. 'That suggests to me that they want to . let the country, and the world, know that this is a ''new'' country,' Han S. Park, a University of Georgia professor who works frequently with . top U.S. and North Korean officials, after watching the events in . Pyongyang. 'In his speech today, he said ''we have a second century of . Kim Il Sung Korea''.' The young leader also underlined his . commitment to aggressively building the economy and improving the . people's daily lives, an approach backed up by a decision to promote two . economists to key Workers' Party posts earlier in the week. North Korea has suffered decades of . economic hardship following a famine in the mid-1990s and the loss of . aid from the Soviet Union. Kim Jong Un's formal three-year succession . has coincided with a push to improve the economy by employing modern . technology. Display: A North Korean man stands on a rooftop near a North Korean flag as fighter jets fly past during the procession today . The aerial show of strength was designed to show North Korea's military prowess, something Kin Jong Un is keen to reinforce after the rocket flop last week . North Korea is in the midst of two . weeks of celebrations marking Kim Il Sung's birthday and the upcoming . 80th anniversary of the Korean People's Army. But it has also become a . showcase of Kim Jong Un's new era of leadership, with Kim giving the . world a taste of his foreign policy by firing the rocket Friday in . defiance of outside criticism. In a surprise admission, North Korea's . state media announced hours later that the bid to send a satellite into . space was a failure. Condemnation abroad was swift, and the . launch - using the same type of rocket technology used for firing a . long-range missile - raised concerns that a nuclear test might be next. The finale in Sunday's military parade was the new long-range missile. Military analysts in Japan and South . Korea said further examination is needed to determine whether it was a . new intercontinental ballistic missile that North Korea reportedly has . been building.

Soldiers carry an image of North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung, whose centenary they were celebrating today . 'Dear Leader': North Korean soldiers carry an image of their late leader Kim Jong Il during the mass parade in Pyongyang . The exact design could not immediately be confirmed by North Korean military officials. Narushige Michishita, a North Korea . military expert at Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy . Studies, said the missile appeared to be new but strongly resembled the . rocket used on Friday and also the long-range Taepodong-2, which North . Korea first launched, unsuccessfully, in 2006. He said it probably has three stages . but did not appear to be big enough to have the 15,000-kilometer . (9,000-mile) range needed to effectively attack the United States, which . would be the goal of an ICBM for the North. Judging from the size of . the soldiers in the background, its length appeared to be more than 30 . meters (100 feet), which would also be about the same or possibly a bit . bigger than the rocket used on Friday. Men in white from North Korea's march just two days after a satellite launch timed to mark the centenary fizzled out embarrassingly when the rocket apparently exploded within minutes of blast off and plunged into the sea . North Korean soldiers march in front of flower waving civilians in a show of strength. But how leadership of the rogue state will fare in the coming years remains to be seen . Military pilots in blue goggles, matching medals and black boots shout as they march past the podium during the military parade today . 'I don't think this is a serious . ICBM,' Michishita said. 'Putting it on display has a psychological . impact, and that would have been greater if Friday's launch had worked. But North Korea has a very bad record with long-range missiles. It think . this is more a propaganda ploy than a military advance.' A number of North Koreans at the parade said it was the first time they had seen the new missile. Kim Jong Un said in his speech that . the era when nuclear arms could be used to threaten and blackmail his . country was 'forever over.' 'Superiority in military technology is no longer monopolized by imperialists,' he said. Kim Jong Un's speech was 'an . expression of confidence,' said Kim Yeon-su of Korea National Defense .

A convicted cop killer is hoping to avoid the death penalty by using the increasingly common defense that he isn’t smart enough to face execution for his brutal crimes. Ronell Wilson, now 30, was convicted of the 2003 murder of detectives Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin during an undercover sting in the New York borough of Staten Island. On Monday lawyers for Wilson began trying to convince a federal judge to uphold an appeals court's decision to overturn his death sentence. Too dumb to die? Wilson's Facebook pages includes inspirational quotes and this photo of him proudly displaying a Bloods gang tattoo on his toned bicep . Wilson pictured left in his 2003 mugshot and right in his current Facebook profile image . With an IQ of just under 70, defense attorneys say Wilson is mildly retarded and therefore should receive life in prison, rather than the death penalty. Prosecutors however plan to use letters, phone calls and emails sent by Wilson as evidence that he is at least smart enough to function - and to know right from wrong. Wilson’s Facebook page, which includes quotes from several acclaimed intellectuals including civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., author Ralph Ellison and industrialist Henry Ford, will also be used to counter claims that he is mentally retarded. Wilson, who joined Facebook a year ago, cites some of his likes as vocabulary and writing, while his page also includes a photo of him proudly displaying a Bloods gang tattoo on his toned bicep. In a procedure expected to last three weeks, the judge will examine Wilson’s complete educational history, as well as a formal IQ score and adaptive function tests. If he scores low enough, it could save his life. Convicted murderer Wilson has posted a famous quote from famous African-American civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. on his Facebook page . Wilson's Facebook page also included quotes from industrialist Henry Ford and author Ralph Ellison . The judge will also consider if a . mentally handicap person would be capable of understanding the . inspirational quotes posted on his page. In . January Wilson posted this by thoughtful remark by Rev. King: ‘True . compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar . . . It understands . that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.’ From ‘Invisible Man’ author Ellison, he quoted: ‘It takes a deeper commitment 2 change and an even deeper commitment 2 grow.’ ‘Coming . 2gether is a beginning; Keepin 2gether is a process; Working 2gether is . a success,’ is a remark originally made by Henry Ford, founder of Ford . Motors. Wilson was convicted of murdering detectives James Nemorin, left, and Rodney Andrews, right,  during a 2003 undercover sting in the New York borough of Staten Island . Wilson does not have access to the internet from his cell on Death Row in Terre Haute, Ind., or at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he’s currently detained, so an outsider helps update his page. But Wilson does send emails that are posted to the page, reports the New York Post. Wilson is the latest of many killers to employ the low IQ defense, also known as the Atkins defense. The ‘not smart enough’ argument has been increasingly made on behalf of death row inmates since a 2002 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, in Atkins v. Virginia, that held executing mentally retarded individuals violates the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishments.","Ronell Wilson was convicted in 2003 of murdering two detectives .

Charged: Eugene Palmer has been charged with the murder of his daughter-in-law Tammy . A pensioner has been charged with the murder of his daughter-in-law two months after she was killed. Eugene Palmer, 73, from Haverstraw, New York, has been missing since Tammy Palmer's death on September 24 but police took the action against him in his absence. The 39-year-old was shot dead as she returned home after putting her two children on the school bus. After allegedly killing his daughter-in-law, Palmer is believed to have confessed to his sister, Elaine Babcock. He then fled from the scene and has not been seen since. His truck was found in nearby Harriman State Park on the same day Tammy was killed and officers began a search for him. Palmer was a recreational hunter familiar with the rocky, hilly terrain of the 45,000-acre park. However, experts have cast doubt on the possibility he could have survived outdoors in the cold days that followed the killing. Mrs Palmer was found dead with shotgun pellet wounds to her chest and arm. It is believed she was first hit in the arm and then a second and third time in her chest, killing her. The gun was found near her body in the yard of her Willow Grove Road home. Tammy Palmer's family claimed that . Eugene Palmer had began a campaign of harassment against her after the . 39-year-old took out an order of protection against her estranged . husband, John. The order prevented him from entering . the home where she was raising their two children, aged 12 and 16. She . lived in a separate house but on the same property as her father-in-law. Dead: Tammy Palmer, pictured right with her two children, was shot dead on Monday September 24 . Mrs Babcock, Palmer's sister claimed he rushed to her house straight after the killing and admitted what he'd done. 'He just came in and said, 'Here’s money to pay my taxes with, I’ve had enough. 'I . shot and killed Tammy. Give me an hour to get away and then do whatever . you have to do — call the police... whatever you have to do,' and then . he just took off,' Babcock told CBS. Ms Babcock said she immediately called police, who believe he fled into Harriman State Park, which backs onto his property. Search teams began hunting woods . for the man, a retired park ranger, using tracking dogs and helicopters. They soon discovered his vehicle, a 1995 green Dodge Ram . pickup truck. Tammy Palmer's parents are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their daughter. They say her relationship with her father-in-law had grown increasingly ugly, culminating in a fight. 'She . told me 'Mommy, don’t worry I’ll be alright.' I don’t think she ever . thought that this man would kill her,' Tammy's mother Violet Pannirello . told CBS.

Gunman: Michael Atherton killed three people and himself but had been allowed to keep his guns despite domestic violence and a suicide bid being reported to police . Triple killer Michael Atherton had been allowed to keep his guns by police despite historic complaints of domestic violence and threatening to shoot 'his own head off', it has emerged today. The taxi driver, 42, killed his 47-year-old partner Susan McGoldrick, her sister Alison Turnbull, 44, and her niece Tanya Turnbull, 24, before taking his own life during a New Year’s Day massacre this year. He blasted them with his licensed shotgun before killing himself. The four bodies were found in a semi-detached house in Horden, near Peterlee, County Durham. The BBC’s Inside Out North East & Cumbria has seen a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on the handling of Atherton’s firearms certificate. The IPCC is not due to officially release the report until the conclusion of inquests into the four deaths. But according to Inside Out, the report brands Durham Police’s failure to remove Atherton’s guns 'inexcusable' and 'unacceptable'. It said the report details how a note was stuck to Atherton’s file when he applied for his licence which said: '4 domestics - last one 24/4/04 . . . . . would like to refuse - have we sufficient info - refuse re public safety'. But this recommendation was overruled because it was thought Atherton would win an appeal. He was given a licence to keep six guns and warned it would be revoked if he behaved 'irresponsibly'. Killed: Tanya Turnbull, 24, left, was blasted to . death on New Year's Day and right, Susan McGoldrick who was also shot . dead by Atherton - who had licences for six firearms . Shot dead: Alison . Turnbull (left) died alongside her daughter Tanya (right) who at 24 was the . youngest of the three killed in the New Year's Day tragedy . Officers removed his guns after a drunken incident in 2008 during which he threatened to 'shoot his own head off'. But they were returned six weeks later. The programme said the IPCC has not recommended criminal or disciplinary action but found there was no 'meaningful review' of Atherton’s licences by police after the 2008 incident and no record of why the decision was made. Escape: Laura McGoldrick, pictured at her 18th birthday party, was shot during the incident but managed to escape by climbing through a window along with her boyfriend . Laura McGoldrick, who escaped from the house, told Inside Out: 'I know I’m not Einstein or anything (but) if a man tried to commit suicide, or pretended to, why would you give a man a gun back like that with a family in the house?'

Mr Banks said: 'At the conclusion of the inquest, Durham Constabulary will respond in full to all of the issues raised in the IPCC’s report. Since the tragic events in January, we have carried out a full review of policy and procedures. 'It would be wholly inappropriate to comment further on the outcome of an investigation in advance of the official publication of the findings, and the coroner’s inquest.

Palestinians are working to rebuild a network of smuggling tunnels that were targeted during eight days of violence in Gaza. Just days after a ceasefire was called between Palestine and Israel, workers were today trying to repair the network that is used to bring in food and arms from Egypt. Experts estimate that as of yesterday about half of the network of hundreds of tunnels was still in use. Secret tunnel: A worker repairs a smuggling tunnel dug beneath the Egyptian-Gaza border in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip today . Targeted: About half of the network of hundreds of tunnels are believed to still be in operation following eight days of violence. Workers, pictured, drag crates of sand as they try to repair the damaged tunnel . Repairs: Residents along the Egypt-Gaza borders have today seen inspectors checking for damage in the tunnel network . The Associated Press said people living along the Egypt-Gaza border today spoke of workers inspecting the damage but that many of the tunnels are still in operation. While the tunnels are considered a lifeline to bring in vital goods such as fuel and construction materials into Gaza, they are also used by Hamas to illegally import weapons. A report by the International Crisis Group estimated that between $500 and $700 million worth of goods are passed through the Egypt-Gaza tunnels each year. They have been used to get goods into the Gaza strip since 2007 when the Israelis stepped up a blockade. Benedetta Berti, a research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told USA Today: 'You can smuggle weapons, have people going in and out. Security on the border and monitoring tunnels ... has to be done.' Photographs taken today show workers using sand, wooden planks and excavators to make urgent repairs to the damaged network, as international aid agencies also raced to replenish supplies to Gaza's 1.6 million residents.

A Hamas spokesman said Israel's eight-day bombardment of the Gaza Strip has caused more than $1.2 billion in direct and indirect damages . Today, Egyptian mediators began . discussions with both sides to negotiate new border arrangements for the . impoverished coastal strip. It follows the ceasefire on Wednesday which called a halt to eight days of violence that left 160 Palestinians, at least half of them civilians, and six Israelis, including four civilians, dead. The deal called for the ‘opening of crossings and facilitating the movement of people of goods’. Israel agreed to end hostilities and Hamas agreed to stop its attacks. Todays's indirect talks between Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip and Israel were the first since the end of the violence. The militants want Israel to lift what remains of its blockade of Gaza, imposed five years ago after Hamas seized control of the territory from its Western-backed rival Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. While Israel has eased the blockade in recent years, key restrictions remain in place on exports out of Gaza and the entry of badly needed building materials into the territory. The Palestinians are hopeful that Egypt's new Islamist government will ease its own restrictions on movement in and out of the territory. Egypt still limits foot traffic through the Rafah border crossing. The militants also hope to turn the Rafah terminal into a major cargo crossing. In return, Israel wants an end to arms smuggling into Gaza. Iranian-made weapons have made their way into Gaza through a circuitous route that ends with underground tunnels along the Egyptian border. Damaged: An excavator operates at the site of a destroyed smuggling tunnel. The network of tunnels was targeted during the eight-day Israeli offensive - although about half are believed to be still in use .

Scientists have identified a gene which could help solve the problem of infertility in humans.

They believe the huddling process is necessary to ensure the egg’s healthy development and fertilisation. When the SRPK gene is missing, chromosomes do not 'huddle' together, something necessary for the egg's healthy development and fertilisation . Chromosomes are thread-like structures which contain a person’s DNA, and when they divide it can lead to sterility and low fertility, according to the study. Previous research in mice has shown that the huddling process is essential in order for eggs to remain fertile, the scientists said. By identifying the genes involved in the process, the experts now hope to gain an understanding of what goes on in the creation of fertile reproductive cells. Fruit fly eggs serve as a good model to understand why low fertility arises in humans, say the researchers . The team said further research is needed to help build a more detailed picture on how huddling works. Professor Hiroyuki Ohkura, from the University of Edinburgh’s School of Biological Sciences, said: 'Fruit fly eggs serve as a good model to understand why sterility and low fertility arises in humans. 'By studying the phenomenon of chromosome clustering, shared by fruit flies and humans and identifying genes like SRPK we are gaining insights into fertility health.' The study is published in the Journal of Cell Science and was funded by the Wellcome Trust. Scientists from the Pasteur Institute in France and University College London shave previously found that a faulty gene could help explain some cases of unexplained male infertility. Mutations of the NR5A1 gene were found in a small percentage of infertile men. In the majority of cases, doctors can find no cause for male infertility, despite it accounting for up to half of cases in which couples have difficulty conceiving. Male infertility appears to be more common within certain families, and this leads scientists to believe that there may be a genetic root for some cases, but only a handful of gene mutations which might be responsible have actually been found.","Chromosomes must 'huddle' together to ensure an egg’s healthy development and fertilisation .

Jimmy Carr can heave a huge sigh of relief - it has been revealed he is not the only celebrity to avoid handing over large amounts of cash to the tax man. Today more than 12 million historic tax records spanning 400 years have been released and show the rich and famous from previous centuries were just as adept at keeping money in their pockets and away from the Treasury. The previously unseen returns from ancestry.co.uk show legendary Britons like Horatio Nelson, Arthur Conan Doyle, Benjamin Disraeli and even King George III paid paltry amounts. And they didn't need to invest in a sophisticated Jersey-based avoidance scheme like comedian Mr Carr to keep a lot of their cash. Historic tax returns: Sherlock Holmes author Arthur Conan Doyle, left, and naval hero Horatio Nelson, right, paid a small amount of tax on their homes, it has been revealed . This is because when they lived they only had to pay a small amount of land tax to the Government, despite owning huge houses, mansions and palaces all over Britain. Land tax existed from the 17th to the 20th century, before being . abolished in 1968, and the new collections of returns list the owners and occupiers of . properties subject to the tax in England and Wales. The records show King George III, one of Britain's wealthiest and most decadent monarchs, paid £47 in tax for Hampton Court Palace in 1798, the equivalent of £5,166 today, while Nelson paid just £3 in the same year, £316 today, for his house in idyllic Suffolk. A number of eminent politicians also feature in the records. William Pitt the Younger has three properties listed in Kent in 1798 for which he paid a total of £13, £1,370 today in tax. A royal return: This is King George III's tax account for Hampton Court Palace, right page, which he paid £47 for in 1798 . Sherlock creator: New documents show here how much Arthur Conan Doyle paid tax on his London properties . Former PM: This return shows how much Benjamin Disraeli, top entry, paid for his big house in Grosvenor Gate, London . Fellow former Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli paid a similar amount of £10 on his Grosvenor Gate property in 1865, equal to £1,030. And, in 1798, ‘the father of immunology’ and inventor of the smallpox . vaccine, Edward Jenner, managed to pay the equivalent of just £15 today for a . property in Gloucester. Damien Joyce, of anti-tax avoidance group UK Uncut, said he was not surprised by the revelations. Portfolio: William Pitt the Younger had three homes in Kent and this page shows he paid £9 4s in tax for one in Keston . Nation's hero: This return shows Horatio Nelson, top entry, bought the Suffolk home of a deceased man and paid £3 tax . ‘The rich and famous have a long and dishonourable tradition of dodging their taxes,’ he told Metro. But it appears a low tax rate then was not as controversial as the revelations about Jimmy Carr's tax affairs now. The comedian has made several apologies for paying . as little as 1% tax thanks to an avoidance scheme. More than 1,000 people are thought to be using the . Jersey-based K2 scheme, which is said to be sheltering £168m a year from . the Treasury. Low rates: Jimmy Carr, right, admitted this month he had put millions into a tax avoidance scheme and King George III also paid small amounts to the Treasury . Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson - one . of our greatest naval heroes, Nelson appears in the records paying £3 in . 1798 for a property in Suffolk, the equivalent of £316 today Arthur Conan Doyle - a Scottish author and physician best known for . penning the Sherlock Holmes detective series. Doyle was taxed £5 (£473 . today) for his abode in Southwark, south London, in 1914. Edward Jenner - known as “the father of immunology”, the English . physician and scientist famed for inventing the smallpox vaccine paid . just 2 shillings and 4 pence in tax for a property in Gloucester in . 1798, around £15 today. King George III is listed as paying £47 . tax on the palace at Hampton Court in 1798, the equivalent of £5,166 . today, yet the estate in its entirety was taxed £227 (around £23,933 in . today’s money). The archive of 12 million ‘historic council tax’ records from the 17th to the 20th Century have been published online by family history website Ancestry.co.uk. Ancestry’s international content manager Miriam Silverman said: 'These records will allow millions of people to . uncover the, often surprising, rates of tax that their ancestors were . subject to. 'Land Tax was like a ‘council tax’ of the time and these records enable . us to glimpse into how much was paid by some of Britain’s most famous . figures - including the King himself.

Ruth's 22-year-old son Jeffrey is on trial for her murder, when he allegedly bludgeoned and stabbed her to death in their home. The latest revelations come on the second full day of the trial, after the prosecution opened last week by playing the chilling 911 tapes where the suspect's father tells the operator that 'there's blood everywhere, I don't know what's going on'. Scroll down for video . Family: Jeffrey, left, stands behind his little sister Julia, beside his mother Ruth and his father Bernard, right, who maintains his son's innocence . Jeffrey, who was described as a star . student at the University of Michigan, was known to have a tempermental . and oftentimes violent relationship with his mother who suffered from . several mental illnesses. She was bipolar and had spent two . weeks in jail nine months before her death for attempting to strangle . Jeffrey, according to reports. From 1998 onwards, Ruth Pyne's mental . health deteriorated, and she would threaten to kill herself and her son. After this she was diagnosed with being both bipolar and a paranoid . schizophrenic. Over the coming years, psychiatrists . would describe her as 'angry and violent', 'severely mentally ill', 'a . danger to herself and others' and suffering from 'acute mania', court . records show. In 2009, in a petition to the probate . court asking that his wife be committed to a mental hospital, Bernard . Pyne wrote she was refusing medication, believed a computer chip had . been implanted in her daughter and had been 'striking our son for no . reason'. Now prosecutors say that Jeffrey was . the one striking his mother, as he allegedly broke her arm and skull . with one of the missing 2-4 wooden boards before stabbing her 16 times, according to the Detroit Free Press. Trial begins: Jeffrey Pyne, 21, faces life in prison if found guilty of the murder of his mother who was found bludgeoned to death in the family garage . Charmed life: The Pyne family owned a roomy tri-level home on a one-acre lot with a pool in Highland Township, a rural community in western Oakland County . An Oakland County detective testified . that Bernard Pyne, Jeffrey's father, called him over to the house days . after the May 27th murder to report that the construction items were . missing but nothing in the house itself was gone. The defense has suggested that the . brutal murder could have been committed by an intruder although nothing . was stolen from the home, according to the Detroit News. Detective Steve Zdravaovski also said . that traces of Ruth's blood was found in the drain of the upstairs tub, . implying that the murderer went to the first floor to clean after the . afternoon murder. The murder trial of a star athlete and . school ace accused of brutally murdering his mother began Friday and . prosecutors decided to start by playing the shocking 911 tapes that . catch the horrific scene of the crime. 'She's laying in the garage,' Bernard Pyne is heard saying. 'There's blood everywhere. I don't know what's going on.' According to ABC. , the accused Mr Pyne sat expressionless through the opening statements. He was arrested five months after the murder and held without bond for more than a year. Accused: Pyne has been described as a star student and a fine athlete . Prosecutors showed jurors photos of . the blisters on Jeffrey's hands hours after the murder. He explained the . wounds to his boss as the results of throwing a shipping pallet. 'It did seem odd to me,' his boss, . farmer William Cartwright said. 'I expected more of a splinter or scrape . than what looked like rope burns.' Still, community members and Jeffrey's . father Bernard maintain that he is innocent. It took two days to find . an impartial, 12-member jury. 'The people in the community are . hugely supportive of this young man,' Detroit Free Press journalist Lori . Brasier told ABC News. 'Even people who believe he may have actually . killed his mother still support him, and you don't usually find that in . the community.' Jeffrey Pyne's defense attorneys says he is innocent, too.

But Swedish fashion group H&M has called for a change in the treatment of countries factory workers - urging for a higher minimum wage and annual pay reviews. Underpaid: Some workers in Bangladesh are paid as little as $36 a month - the equivalent of around £23 . Fighting for fair fashion: Highstreet chain H&M has urged the Bangladeshi government to raise the minimum wage . Chief executive Karl-Johan Persson said: 'We want to see a stable market in which people are treated with respect, and where the workers are properly compensated by their employers.' Persson told a news conference he had met Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and urged the government to lift the minimum wage and introduce annual wage reviews. Persson, who said H&M intended to grow its business in Bangladesh by 10-15 per cent annually, said it was in the country's interests to develop an advanced and mature textile industry. Calling for change: Chief Executive Officer Karl-Johan Persson, left, said he has discussed the issue of raising the minimum wage  with Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina . He added: 'If a proper review system . is created and enforced, these revisions will help address the basic . needs of the workers and bring greater stability to the market.' The . move comes as tensions continue to rise in the country with factory workers striking over poor pay and working condition in the country's 4,500 garment . factories. Earlier this year, a panel of judges in Cambodia, where H&M also sources garments, urged clothes factory owners to pay more and called on international fashion brands to do more to improve working conditions. Analysts also believe that labour unrest and delayed shipping schedules may erode the advantage to retailers of low prices. Rising tension: Garment workers striking over pay throw pieces of bricks during clashes with police in Kanchpur, Dhaka, in June . Clashes: The unrest and closure of numerous factories had caused delays to garment shipments . The Swedish store's Spanish rival .

Supermarkets have been accused of fuelling an obesity crisis with ‘irresponsible’ promotions on sugary junk food. Discounts and buy one, get one free deals are skewed towards unhealthy products, according to a study. Prices and nutrition data across 6,000 food and drink items sold over a year by Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Ocado were analysed by the University of East Anglia’s Norwich Business School. Fuelling obesity: Researchers claim buy one, get one free deals are geared towards unhealthy foods . Professor Paul Dobson, head of the business school, said: ‘We found a bias towards sugary products for price promotions and that straight price discounts are on average more skewed towards unhealthy products.’ A snapshot survey yesterday found, for example, that Tesco has a £1 offer on boxes of Maltesers and tubes of Cadbury Fair Trade Buttons and Smarties, and price drops of up to 50 per cent on Terry’s Chocolate Orange,  Cadbury Roses, Thorntons and Quality Street products. Asda’s current deals include two £1.98 bottles of Coca-Cola for £2.50, while Sainsbury’s offers include a 58 per cent saving on a Cadbury Collection tin, bringing the price down to £5. Survey: More than 6,000 products sold by the UK's biggest supermarkets were analysed - with sugary products having the best promotion deals . Britain’s obesity rate has risen from 15 per cent to 26 per cent since 1993, while projections suggest 60 per cent of men and 50 per cent of women will be obese by 2050. Just over a third of ten and . 11-year-olds are overweight or obese but in many areas the rates are far . higher, Department of Health figures show. The worst is Southwark, London, where 42 . per cent are deemed too fat. In four other boroughs of the capital – . Barking, Enfield, Greenwich and Hackney – the figure is 41 per cent. They are closely followed by Sandwell, . near Birmingham, where 40 per cent of 11-year-olds are overweight or . obese, and Manchester, where it is 39 per cent. Last week the Government signed a voluntary ‘Responsibility Deal’ with supermarkets and food companies to boost the promotion of fruit and vegetables, but Professor Dobson said more radical action was needed. ‘What is required is a comprehensive move away from price promoting unhealthy foods rather than token gestures for marketing spin,’ he added. ‘It is simply irresponsible for supermarkets to overly promote foods  with high sugar and fat content. Food producers can do more by reducing  the fat, sugar and salt content of processed foods, while food retailers can ensure healthy and nutritious choices are available and affordable, and that they practise responsible marketing. ‘Responsibility lies with both retailers and producers, otherwise regulation might be needed.’ Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium, which speaks for supermarkets, said: ‘There’s no such thing as an unhealthy food, only an unhealthy diet. ‘Retailers have been encouraging people to eat more fruit and vegetables with innovative products, prominent promotions and competitive pricing for years.’","Research by the University of East Anglia’s Norwich Business School found special offers are skewed towards unhealthy products .

A major piece of evidence in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin has yet to be analyzed - his cell phone. Attorneys for shooter George Zimmerman are fighting to get information pulled from phone records in the hope of shedding light on the teenager's death. The phone was found at the scene with its battery dead on the night that Trayvon Martin was killed on February 26 in Sanford, Florida. Fighting: George Zimmerman's attorneys want a state order to pull more information from Trayvon Martin's phone . Firestorm: When George Zimmerman's attorney hope there's information on the phone to back his claim that he shot and killed teenager Trayvon Martin in self-defense . It is a two-year-old Huawei U8150 smartphone, sold by T-Mobile as the 'Comet,' which shot video and photos as well as had internet connectivity. Police have tried without success to download data from the phone. They even asked the teenager's father Tracy Martin for the security codes to unlock it, but after he did not provide them, police gave the phone to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. Mr Martin told them he would check with attorneys but authorities say he never again addressed their request. He later told reporters he would not help police download information from the phone. 'I don't know anything about that,' said family attorney Benjamin Crump. 'We're going to do anything prosecutors say we should.' Zimmerman's attorney said that crime-lab specialists have only had partial success retrieving messages and photos from the device. Without the security code, analysts are unable to unlock the phone and download information from its primary data storage site. See you in court: Family attorney Benjamin Crump said the Martin's would turn over cell phone security codes if prosecutors asked them to . Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said that analysts have only been able to download files from the phone's two removable-storage devices - its SIM card and SD card - but that internal chip has yet to be cracked. Zimmerman, is charged with second-degree murder in the February killing of Trayvon Martin and has maintained that he acted in self-defense. His attorneys hope information on the phone could back that claim. It could reveal who and what might have been on Martin's mind at the time of the shooting from his text messages. Attorneys say it could give them a better insight into the 17-year-old through the websites he visited and the photos and video he shot. The information currently available on the phone 'tells me the last few phone calls, but that's about it,' O'Mara told the Orlando Sentinel. 'It looks like there is other information that I should have.' Google may be able to bypass the security system because the phone operates with Android software owned by that tech company, said Dave . Kleiman, a computer forensic technician and expert witness with . Computer Forensics LLC in West Palm Beach said. Record: The phone could be a connection to a key witness who claimed to hear Zimmerman demand to know what Trayvon was doing . In a more extreme measure that could destroy the phone, a technician could pull the chip out. The neither the Florida Department of Law Enforcement or the Special Prosecutor's office have responded to interview requests regarding how they have handled the phone. FDLE analyst Stephen Brenton analyzed the phone on March 26, but since then it seems that no one has attempted to retrieve information from it. O'Mara plans to use a December 11 hearing to seek an order for the state to provide more information about the phone. The phone also provides a connection to a 16-year-old Miami girl who said she was on the phone with Martin just before he was shot. The witness claimed that Martin had told her he was scared of a man following him, and heard Trayvon have an exchange with an unidentified man demanding to know what he was 'doing around here' before the line went dead. Backing the girl's account is a phone log of calls that Tracy Martin gave to ABC News. The last recorded call was 7.12 pm and the shooting happened four minutes later.","Trayvon Martin, 17, shot dead on February 26 in Sanford, Florida ."

Disappointing sales have led the fast food giant to begin testing new menu items, including three new varieties of its prized Quarter Pounders. The new burgers in development include a Habanero Ranch Quarter Pounder, with white cheddar, hickory-smoked bacon and a new habanero-ranch sauce; a Deluxe Quarter Pounder, with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickle, mayonnaise and mustard; and a Bacon and Cheese Quarter Pounder, with American cheese, bacon, red onion, pickle, mustard and ketchup. New additions: McDonald's is changing up its menu with three new Quarter Pounders in the works . The company is also getting ready to launch a new McMuffin made with egg whites. The Oak Brook, Ill.-based chain is testing its new fast food products during a time of major transition for consumer goods companies in the United States, as Nation’s Restaurant News reports. McDonald’s posted its first monthly sales drop in nine years earlier this month, amid a loss of customers to rival chains such as Burger King. McDonald's global same-store sales fell 2.2 per cent in October. Soon after that sales drop made headlines, McDonald’s announced plans to replace its U.S. president, Jan Fields, who has been with the company for more than 35 years and who drove the expansion of its popular McCafe drink menu. On her way out: McDonald's U.S. president, Jan Fields, is stepping down from her role after 35 years with the company . Regime change: Jeff Stratton, McDonald's global chief restaurant officer, is set to become the company's new U.S. president on December 1 . Fields will be replaced by Jeff Stratton, McDonald’s global chief restaurant officer effective December 1, the company said. ‘We feel that now was the right time to make a change in leadership for the U.S. business,’ company spokeswoman Heidi Barker Sa Shekhem said on November 15. McDonald’s chief executive, Don Thompson, recently told investors that slow growth and increased competition in the United States would be a ‘new normal’ for the brand, requiring a greater emphasis on less expensive menu items. Several factors are impacting McDonald's declining sales, including the undercooked U.S. economy and high unemployment among younger consumers who tend to favor fast food. Other fast food chains, including Wendy’s and Yum! Brands, which operates KFC and Pizza Hut, have been suffering similar fates. McDonald’s operates or franchises more than 34,000 restaurants worldwide, including more than 14,000 in the United States.

But with the fame and fortune of billionaire Stewart Rahr are numerous stories of tantrums, violence and pay-offs - all of which he denies. Rahr, one of the world's richest men who sold his pharmaceutical supplier company Kinray for $1.3billion in 2010, is known for his mountain of photos with top celebrities, including Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, Mark Wahlberg, Alicia Keys, Andre Agassi and Joaquin Phoenix. Rubbing elbows: Stewart Rahr, one of the world's richest men is perhaps best known for his mountain of photos with top celebrities, including Kim Kardashian and Kanye West . Famous friends: Rahr also has photos with music legend Clive Davis, left, as well as Russell Simmons and Brian Grazer, right . The New York Post reported that Rahr was willing to hand over a million dollars in an effort to get accepted at ultra-exclusive Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, Long Island. Security aficionado Bo Dietl told the Post: 'The guy was dying to get in there. So he actually handed me a blank check for a million dollars for the owner to give to a charity of his choice. I told [club founder Michael Pascucci], ""Don’t let this douchebag in.""' Dietl added: 'I've known him for 20 years. He buys everybody.' But Rahr tells a different story, saying that 'he came to me eight months later and wanted the check back. I said, ""Forget it.""' Another incident stemmed from a dispute between Rahr and professional gambler RJ Cipriani. Allegations: Professional gambler RJ Cipriani and his wife Greice Santo, have accused Rahr of trying to force his way into her hotel room . Cipriani told the Post that he was flying to Las Vegas recently with his wife Greice Santo and Rahr, and Rahr promised to look after his wife after he was unexpectedly called away to Los Angeles. Santo claimed that Rahr grew angry with her after she refused to meet him and friends for dinner at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas. She said that Rahr tried to force his way into her room at the hotel, and would not leave when she asked him to. But Rahr again denied any wrongdoing, telling the Post: 'I tried to help the guy. I wish I’d never met him.' Last week, it was reported that Rahr pulled a gun on an elevator operator at New York's Trump Tower after an altercation with the man. When police arrived, Rahr was found to have a gun, which was confiscated by officers. He  claimed it wasn't loaded. Earlier this month, Rahr was banned from top New York restaurant Nobu after the staff said that he allegedly threatened to kill the manager when he didn't get his favorite table. Rahr reportedly sent a email of complaint to Nobu owner Drew Nieporent. Rahr admits having a disagreement with a female manager but denied threatening to kill her after she ignored his phone call, according to the Post. The paper reports that after the face-to-face confrontation with the manager, he sent a caps-locked tirade to Nieporent and CC'ed a group of his famous friends including Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alicia Keys, Andre Agassi and Joaquin Phoenix. Three other recipients have some political pull, including NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly, Rahr's 'buddy' Donald Trump, and Robert DeNiro who co-owns the restaurant chain with Nieporent. The dispute stems from an incident where the 66-year-old allegedly got into a verbal altercation with restaurant manager Sharon Hofstetter when Rahr tried to get his favorite table on the night of his wife's surprise birthday party. Powerful pals: Rahr prides himself on his celebrity connections, seen here with Prince Harry at a polo match . Close: Rahr (right) sent an email complaint to the owner of Nobu and cc'ed a number of celebrities including Mark Wahlberg (second right). Though in this picture, Cindy Crawford, her husband Rande Gerber, and Jeremy Piven didn't get the email . He reportedly walked up to an occupied . table and asked the group who was dining there to move so that he could . have 'his' table. A bartender told the paper that the group refused and he offered to pay their bill if they would agree. Rahr, who calls himself 'Stewie Rah . Rah- the No. 1 King of Fun', then left an irate message for Hofstetter, . who was not at the restaurant at the time of the interaction. She did not call him back immediately so he went to the restaurant on 57th Street to have it out with her in person. 'He called me the c-word and said he would kill me,' Hofstetter told The Post. Rahr claimed that Hofstetter was supposed to meet him at his office to plan the party in question, so he went to the restaurant to give her a piece of his mind. 'I told her ""I can't stand you. You're despicable."" Did I curse at her or threaten to kill her? No true- please. I would never say that,' Rahr told the paper. Feeling like his message may not be clear, Rahr decided to send the email to Nieporent and copy his A-list pals. Leading ladies: Rahr has been pictured with Victoria Beckham (left) and model Petra Nemcova (right) 'I GUESS THAT U R MUCH TOO BUSY TO . CALL BACK AN UPSET CUSTOMER. I HAD TOLD U THAT I HAD A MAJOR PROBLEM . & A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE CONCERNING A SURPRISE PARTY FOR A . VERY VERY CLOSE FRIEND THIS PAST WEDS,' he wrote in the email. Rahr, . who owned drug manufacturer Kinray until he sold it for $1.3billion in . 2010, went on to talk about his wealth in the email, using it as an . unexpected way to rub his business savvy in Nieporent's face. Upset: Stewart Rahr took issue with how he was treated at Nobu57 in Manhattan . 'I . HAD ONLY 3 employees & revenues of only $40,000... WHEN I RECENTLY .

Controversy: Outcry after Dylan Mayer's catch of an octopus, seen proudly displayed in his arms, has launched a potential ban on their hunt statewide . National outcry over a 19-year-old Seattle diver who caught and killed an octopus while publically boasting of his kill has pressed lawmakers one step closer to banning their hunt potentially statewide. 'The harvesting of this animal has resulted in a strong, negative reaction from the public and the dive community,' Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Phil Anderson said in a release. 'We believe this area may merit additional restrictions to enhance the traditional uses of this popular beach.' Hunting octopus is legal in Central Puget Sound, with a maximum catch of one per day. But on October 31st, the sight of Dylan Mayer punching and beating the 30-pound female on shore before throwing it in his truck bed and driving off easily unnerved many residents. 'As they were coming in you could tell the octopus was alive. It was writhing around and they were wrestling with it,' said Bob Bailey, a dive instructor who witnessed Mayer bring the octopus on shore with one of his students. 'It's just not done. It's bad form. Even if you can do it, you shouldn't do it,’ he said. Local activists photographed Mayer's catch and posted the photos on their website, urging outraged residents to sign a petition banning the harvesting of giant Pacific octopuses. Scroll down for video . Fresh catch: Mr Mayer is photographed after loading the live cephalopod into the back of his pickup truck on October 31st . The animals are not protected and their population is said to be healthy. Seattle Times also reports Myers having had a permit to catch shellfish in the area. ‘I don't have an issue with hunting,’ Mr Bailey told the Seattle Times. ‘People dive for all sorts of reasons. I don't have a problem with it. It is not whether you hunt, it is where you hunt, and there are appropriate and inappropriate places to do that.’ But he added: ‘People come from all over the world to dive here and see the octopus that live here.’ Earlier this month Scott Lundy, a member of the Washington Scuba Alliance, presented the WDFW a petition signed by 5,000 divers supporting a ban on killing octopuses at Seacrest Park. It's a ban Mr Mayer has since latched onto himself. 'I didn’t know they were so beloved, or I wouldn’t have done it,' he said according to a WDFW release that reported him signing the petition as well. The new Marine Protected Area in Central Puget Sound will require the commission's vote for the new protected area and could take months. Food? Mr Mayer said he planned to eat to octopus and that catching it was no different than catching an eating a fish . Legal: Game wardens said the catch was completely legal and that the diver was within his rights to harvest the animal . Among their considerations are designating Seacrest Park as a marine protected area or prohibiting hunting the animals anywhere in the state. Angry fellow divers from the shore took . photographs of Mayer proudly standing with the large octopus and then . watched in disbelief as he and his friend tossed the still live 30 pound . female onto the bed of his truck before driving off. Their shock turned to horror as a . grinning Mayer posted images of himself measuring the now dead octopus . onto his Facebook account and now is in the position of having to . justify to the diving community why he hunted the gentle and intelligent . animal. 'I eat it for meat. It's no different than fishing. It's just a different animal,' said Mayer at the time to Komo News. Catching the octopus for a friend' s class assignment, requiring him to draw something from nature, he said: . 'He wanted me to get something from nature, so I got an octopus. I caught it, and then these divers came up and started yelling at me. I ignored them and ended up driving away.' 'They’re incredibly intelligent, curious, very playful,' said avid diver Drew Collins. The uproar caused by Mayer has led to the 19-year-old receiving dozens of threatening phone calls and abusive emails. The wannabe rescue diver has said that he has been demonized by the local scuba community and has had to deny claims that the octopus was sitting on eggs when he captured her. 'That's not true. There were no eggs under it, and we checked,' said Mayer. 'I even had a game warden come over and look at it, and even they said there was no problem with it.' Today, however, he says if he could go back to that day he would have done things differently. 'I probably would have gone at a different time. I probably would have gone to another area of Cove Two,' he said. Dylan Mayer measures out the dead octopus on the floor of his garage in Seattle . 'The bottom line is another octopus will move up into that area and take its place.' The . game warden who inspected the catch also said that despite doing . nothing wrong, Mayer could have acted with more sensitivity. 'I think the timing, manner and place where the harvest occurred may be the issue. It could have been done at a better time,' said Wendy Willette. 'It's like deer hunting. You don't kill a deer while kids are viewing it, and I think it's a similar problem here. You need to be sensitive to other drivers and people if you're going to be a sportsman.' Indeed, Mayer told Komo News that he has now been banned from several diver shops in the Seattle area because of the octopus hunt. He said that his dream of becoming a rescue-diver is in jeopardy because he has been banned from several diving schools because of his actions.

A daughter watched as her parents and teenage brother were swept into the ocean in northern California while trying to save their dog, authorities revealed today. The couple, who have not been identified, were later found dead and a search continues for the 16-year-old boy, who is still missing. The girl was at Big Lagoon, a beach by Eureka, which is 300 miles north of San Fransisco in California, as her family was dragged into the water, a spokesperson for the U.S. Coast Guard said. Authorities received a 911 call at 12.40pm to report that the trio was in trouble, but the Coast Guard could not confirm whether the daughter placed the call. Tragedy: A couple has been killed and their teenage son is missing after they tried to save their dog from huge waves in Big Lagoon, California. A massive search is underway for the boy . The tragedy unfolded after the family's dog chased after a thrown stick and was swept into the ocean by eight to ten foot waves. Dana Jones, a state Parks and Recreation district superintendent said the boy went after the dog, prompting his father to go after them. She said the teenager was able to get . out, but when he didn't see his father, he and his mother went into the . water looking for him. 'Both were dragged into the ocean,' Jones said. Ms Jones said a park ranger who was alerted to the incident had to . run a half mile to get to the beach because his car wasn't made to . handle the terrain. When he arrived, he wasn't able to get to them . because of the high surf, she said. Hunt: Authorities have found no sign of the 16-year-old after searching the area for hours . Rescuers eventually retrieved the mother's body and the father's body washed up. The dog got out of the water on its own, Jones said. The Coast Guard deployed a helicopter . and two motor life boats to search for the teenager, but the aerial . search was suspended by 7pm by thick coastal fog. Helicopters remain on standby and U.S. Coast Guard officials planned to . continue searching in the dark if the fog lifted. Two 47-foot motor life . boats were also on the scene searching for the boy. The search continued on Sunday with no further discoveries. The local Sheriff's department is periodically checking along the coast for any sign of the boy, the Coast Guard said.","Family was at Big Lagoon, a beach north of Eureka in northern California, on Saturday afternoon when dog chased a thrown stick into the sea .

A 'cursed' 2,500-year-old Turkish gold brooch which was illegally excavated has been returned home.

Homeowners were today trying to repair the damage to their homes after a £1.7milllion flood defence system failed during torrential rain this weekend. Families in Kempsey, Worcestershire, had not taken action to protect their homes because they believed they were protected by the state of the art pumps - and had even staged a party to celebrate the installation. In fact, the devastation was worse than it had ever been in floods before the system was installed. Villagers branded the failure of the new system 'unacceptable' and said somebody had to take responsibility for the devastation. Evacuated: Resident Dan Corns said it was 'unacceptable' that the pumps had failed, leaving his and other homes under four feet of water . About 30 houses in the village were evacuated in the early hours of Sunday morning after they began filling up with water. A further 60 caravans were flooded during the deluge, with up to two feet of  water in some places. The terrifying night came as parts of Britain . experienced their worst floods for 70 years, breaching more than 800 homes . and leaving 10,000 still at risk. Resident Dan Corns said: 'More than £1m was spent on [the defences] and somebody's got to take responsibility. 'It is unacceptable the pumps failed. 'Literally . within 10 minutes it was rising at a rate of knots. The water has . damaged all of my furniture - we had such little time.' Stained: Homeowners evacuated by boat were today inspecting the damage and cleaning up . Dan Spires showed TV cameras the damage . to his home, admitting that he had not prepared for flooding because he . believed the Government-backed system would protect them. 'Because of the flood defences we didn't expect it to happen, so we hadn't moved everything upstairs, that's the bottom line,' he told BBC News. 'We weren't prepared for this. If the flood defences weren't in, we'd have moved everything because of the warnings that were all over the news.' The defence system was completed in July, after almost 12 months of work, which included the building of a 180m (590ft) earth embankment to protect the village from the River Severn. Sluice gates would close if the Severn flooded, while pumps were intended to remove  water from Hatfield Brook to the other side of the embankment. The Environment Agency confirmed that the pumps failed at about 5am on Sunday morning. They were paid for out of the public purse and with £5,000 raised by villagers themselves. Wrecked: Dan Spires's possessions were ruined after his home filled with water during the deluge this weekend . Shocked: Mr Spires said he had not prepared for flooding or moved furniture upstairs because he thought the defences would protect his house . Extreme: Villagers said that despite the pumps being in place, the flooding was even worse than in 2007, when the river rose to half a metre higher . Resident Michael Gill said the water rose far quicker than in the floods of 2007. Mr Gill said: 'The pumps failed on this occasion and made the flood risk much worse and six or seven houses have been very badly damaged.' Toby Kempton, station commander of the fire service, said several residents who had been rescued were 'distressed and confused'. Kempsey councillor David Harrison said the impact of the heavy rain was worse than it would have been without the water pumps. 'Disappointment': The Environment Agency has visited houses to manually pump out floodwater, but said 30,000 houses had been successfully protected across Britain . 'I was woken up at 5.15am to get down there after the water rose about four feet in half an hour,' he told MailOnline. 'A mobile phone network had gone down and it was chaos. 'About 20 houses were underwater, one of the pubs and the sewage pumping station, so nothing was working. 'The people evacuated by boat included a baby of less than two days old and a 90-year-old and an 87-year-old. Excitement: Homeowners who had put £5,000 of their own money into the Government-backed scheme were delighted when the flood defences were completed in July . 'Residents went around waking other people up. There were fire trucks, fire boats, the police and West Midlands search and rescue arrived later.' He said no one had expected the pumps to fail. 'When you go to a garage and buy a new car, you expect it to work,' he said. 'This is the system's third flood. In July they were worked manually because they weren't quite finished and the second flood was about a month ago, when they worked automatically and worked fine. 'The pumps had been working fine since . Wednesday, but one didn't kick in, and because the gate was closed, . Hatfield Brook ended up higher than the Severn. 'The Environment Agency noticed that one of the pumps wasn't working at about 3am. 'They are looking into how it happened. Up until 2008, Kempsey homes had been flooded 23 times in 30 years, but the EA claimed the project has reduced the risk of flooded homes to a one in 100 chance in any one year. Yet villagers say the damage is worse than the last time they were flooded, in 2007, when the river level was half a metre higher than this time. The fire service said 60 caravans had also flooded in Kempsey. An EA spokesman told MailOnline: 'There are two pumps, one worked and protected up to 80 homes, while the other failed because of an electrical problem. 'It meant that the village was not protected. 'We were on site straight away and had it working within two hours. 'We are investigating what happened and working with local residents. We've been pumping water out of their houses. 'We are disappointed and our hearts go out to those affected. 'Our systems protected more than 30,000 houses and are all working as they should. We have teams routinely checking them and we are shoring up systems that are rising more than expected after five days of persistent rain.' Environment minister Richard Benyon said the Government will be spending £2.17bn 'which will see more flood schemes going ahead'. This morning, however, he told ITV's Daybreak that he was frustrated about flood defence failures. High hopes: One of the two water pumps failed because of an electrical fault, leaving water levels in Kempsey evbn higher than those of the River Severn . He said: 'It is slightly frustrating. I feel really sorry for the people of Kempsey, who were flooded because the pumps didn’t turn on. They must feel really let down this morning and we want to get to the bottom of what happened there. 'But I think at about 10pm last night, the figure of 26,000 homes didn’t flood in the last 48 hours because of flood defences which have been constructed over recent years, and that is a positive story.' Meanwhile, the EA admitted that flood defences at Polperro in Cornwall were 'overtopped' by 'unprecedented' levels of floodwater. A spokesman said the river went from being below flood alert levels to a severe flood warning in the space of two hours. Alan Crockford, a pub landlord in the village, said there had been warnings but 'nobody knew it would get this bad'. He said: 'I was actually in my house and I heard a roar, and just looked outside the window and that was the first bit of water that just, just came down the hill, like a river running straight down the road. 'We were given warnings from Floodline, and they just said, like, to take care; we were never given any firm warning that you had to evacuate and no-one knew to expect it this bad.'

Two hundred thousand homes at high risk of flooding could be left without insurance cover because of a row between the Government and insurers. More than 900 homes, mainly in the South West, have been deluged by flooding since last Wednesday in addition to around 3,000 homes flooded during heavy rains over the summer. Ministers and the insurance industry have so far failed to reach an agreement over how to provide affordable cover to vulnerable homes, despite negotiating for two years. Row: More than 200,000 homes at high risk of flooding could become uninsurable if the Government and the industry fail to strike a deal . Anger: Environment Minister Richard Benyon has accused the insurance industry of trying to take advantage of the situation in flood-hit Britain . Under a previous deal, most homes . which will never experience floods pay a ‘small sum’ on their insurance . premiums to subsidise cover for high-risk homes. But this is due to . expire next year. Insurers, who are furious that the Coalition has cut its flood budget by . £400million despite nearly one in five homes being at risk, said the . Government had rejected their proposals for a new settlement. Nick Starling, of the Association of British Insurers, warned that the . negotiations had reached ‘crisis point’. He said: ‘We’ve had two years . to sort this out – during that time the insurance industry’s put a . massive amount of work and money into coming up with an insurance-led . solution, and we seem to have reached an impasse. ‘I should say first that our members are out there looking after people . who have been affected by these tragic floods, and that means we want a . solution even more now after the difficult events of the weekend.’ Insurers have put forward plans for a Flood Insurance Fund which would . be made up of levies on insurance premiums. They have also asked for . more public cash to be injected into a temporary ‘overdraft’ to pay out . for claims during the current flooding crisis. Claims average £20,000 to £40,000 per flooded home. They say this . overdraft would be paid back by the insurance industry next year when . the scheme has built up cash reserves. Mr Starling said: ‘We’ve had floods all this year, and it’s quite clear . that what in the past was an exception is now becoming the norm.’ Should the government step in to help uninsured homeowners hit by floods? Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who visited flood-hit areas of . Devon yesterday, accused the industry of ‘opportunism’ for raising the . issue in public while the talks were still on-going. He said there had . been ‘constructive and detailed discussions’ up until the end of last . week and that he was looking forward to looking at the latest proposals. Ministers are worried about further hikes to premiums, which analysts . predict could rise by up to 10 per cent from 2014 under such a deal. The Labour government and the insurance industry agreed a Statement of . Principles in 2000, which forces insurers to cover homes in flood-prone . areas, but it expires in June 2013. Painful: A woman wades through flood water near Taunton at the weekend but a deal to make sure every home at flood risk is insured expires next June . High waters: Insurers have to pay-out around £3billion in claims during extreme flooding and want Government backing going forward . If no new agreement is reached, households in flood-risk areas would be . left at the mercy of the market and around 200,000 homeowners would not . be able to secure or afford any insurance at all leaving them unable to . sell or re-mortgage their homes. Mary Creagh, Labour’s environment spokesman, urged ministers to secure a . deal with insurers to provide universal flood cover. She said: ‘If they . can’t sort this out it would be catastrophic for householders who could . be left with properties that they cannot insure, cannot mortgage and . cannot sell.","Deal allowing homes in high flood risk areas to be insured expires next year .

The Football Association has launched an investigation into the vile chanting by some West Ham fans at Tottenham yesterday. Spurs’ 3-1 Barclays Premier League win was overshadowed by sickening songs about the stabbings of the Tottenham fans in Rome last week. Anti-Semitic taunts were also heard, along with persistent hissing and references to Adolf Hitler. Two fans were arrested and later accepted a police caution over the chants. Let down: West Ham fans hit a new low with their chants at White Hart Lane . A spokesman for the Metropolitan . Police said: 'Two men were arrested during the football match between . Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham on Sunday November 25 on suspicion of a . racially aggravated public order offence. 'The men accepted a police caution.' Sportsmail has . learnt that FA officials are waiting to digest the referee's report . before launching a full probe, although off-the-field incidents . typically take longer to investigate . than those on the pitch. High-level discussions are also taking place between the West Ham hierarchy over what action the club will take. Hundreds of West Ham supporters chanted ‘Viva Lazio’ at numerous points during the game in a macabre show of support for the hooligans who left at least 10 Spurs fans injured and one needing emergency surgery. Ashley Mills, 25, of Essex, had to be admitted to hospital for stab wounds to his head and groin after being set upon by a gang of masked thugs while in Rome for Tottenham’s Europa League match against Lazio. Two men have since been charged with attempted murder. Italian flags were seen in the away section on Sunday and a red flare was also set off. After Tottenham had scored their second and third goals, ‘Lazio’ was chanted, bringing ironic cheers from the home crowd. The most distasteful chants were saved for towards the end. In reply to Spurs fans chanting, ‘Can we play you every week?’ West Ham fans sang: ‘Can we stab you every week?’ Anti-semitic chanting, hissing and the references to Hitler  then followed. The FA said in a statement: 'The FA can confirm it has begun investigating reports of abusive chanting at the Tottenham versus West Ham United fixture. 'The FA governance department has this morning contacted both clubs and will continue to make enquiries into the matter in the coming days. 'We note the statement issued by West Ham and encourage clubs to identify and ban for life any individuals involved in incidents of abusive chanting. 'There is no place for anti-Semitism or any form of discrimination in football. The FA is committed to working with the clubs, Leagues, fans groups, the police, CPS and community stakeholders to play our part in addressing this unacceptable behaviour.' At the double: Jermain Defoe scored twice as Tottenham cruised to victory over West Ham . Chance: Tottenham's Gareth Bale tries to score past West Ham's Mohamed Diame (left) at White Hart Lane yesterday . West Ham manager Sam Allardyce said he had not heard the chanting but agreed his fans ‘should not be doing that’. Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas branded the chants as ‘stupid’. Allardyce said: ‘I don’t hear what the fans say or do when I’m concentrating on a game of football. ‘They shouldn’t be doing things like that, should they? But it’s the least of my worries at the minute.’ Asked about the Hitler chanting, Allardyce said: ‘If I didn’t hear it, I can’t condemn it. I’ll wait and look at it myself and then I’ll comment after I’ve listened to what they’ve said. I don’t want to be a political animal. I’m in here to talk about football, not what fans are saying or singing.’ Villas-Boas said: ‘We know the animosity . there is between Tottenham and West Ham. As long as it doesn’t reach . stupidity, it is a great rivalry. Aftermath: The Drunken Ship pub in Rome were Spurs fans were attacked this week . ‘I understand the whole situation is unavoidable although we can’t decipher the complete meaning of what they were singing.’ The two clubs have a long-standing history of abuse between supporters. Former West Ham striker Jermain Defoe, who was booed throughout, scored two of the goals in the win for Tottenham, a victory that takes them one place above the Hammers. Spurs fans have been the subject of complaints by the Society of Black Lawyers who objected to the White Hart Lane supporters singing ‘Yid Army’ about themselves. Sportsmail has highlighted that this kind of disgraceful chanting is just as despicable as racist abuse, pointing out unacceptable behaviour such as vile abuse Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is subjected to at various grounds. Sheffield Wednesday boss Dave Jones, who has been the victim of sustained abuse, said: ‘It is like a form of racism because it is every bit  as bad.’ Spurs supporters rushed to condemn their West Ham rivals on Twitter. Three and easy: Tottenham climbed above the Hammers with this win on Sunday . Andrew Leason wrote: 'West Ham fans & their Lazio/Hitler chants showing what utter vile scum they are.' West Ham fan Andrew Wiseman posted: 'The minority of hammers fans with the Lazio chants should hang their heads in shame. And I'm a Hammer. Pathetic.' Ed Aarons commented: 'Not surprised at all by reports of moronic Lazio chants by West Ham fans at WHL. Not exactly known for their intelligence.' West Ham fans were also accused of hissing in reference to the Jews who were slaughtered by the Nazis in concentration camps. 'Hissing, Lazio chants and (letting off) a flare. You classless bunch of p***** are really enjoying your cup final, aren't you West Ham,' posted Louise Page. And Charlie Parrish added: 'Next to West Ham away fans. Lots of Lazio chants.

Missing: Dylan Redwine vanished the Monday before Thanksgiving while he was spending the day with his father Mark in Vallecito . Scuba divers have now been enlisted to search for a missing 13-year-old boy who disappeared during a court-ordered visit with his father. Dylan Redwine vanished the Monday before Thanksgiving while he was spending the day with his father Mark in Vallecito. The biggest break in the case came when police dogs traced the boy’s scent to the edge of Vallecito Lake, but the scuba teams failed to find any further clues during their search on Sunday. They will continue through Monday using boats equipped with sonar tools that will help scan the depths of the lake. Dylan lives full-time in Colorado Springs with his mother and brothers but was in Vallecito to spend time with his father at the time of his disappearance. His mother Elaine says Dylan was unhappy about having to make the trip, but that he would not have run away from home. 'Dylan wouldn't have left willingly,' Elaine Redwine said on Friday during an interview at the home of a friend. 'If there was any way to communicate he would have called.' The boy's father Mark Redwine told investigators he last saw his son on Monday morning around 7.30am before leaving the home to run errands. He said his son was gone when he returned four hours later. A neighbour who knows Dylan told police he saw the boy walking along a road in Vallecito the afternoon he went missing but thought nothing of it until hearing the police reports. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Scent: Police dogs picked up the trace of an unidentified scent during their search for Dylan but it only extended to the water's edge so they are now using scuba teams with sonar equipment to help . In addition to the scuba team checking the lake, police are still pursuing other options, including a scenario where Dylan ran away from home with the help of a friend. Local station KMGH reports that a postal worker saw a boy matching Dylan’s description walking in Vallecita with another boy about his age. His childhood friends from Bayfield, which is just over 20 miles from the area where Dylan's father lives, suggested an alternative theory that police are also looking into. They believe that Dylan may have tried hitchhiking to go see them in his old hometown, during which he was abducted. Police say they haven't ruled out foul play. Break from family: Dylan's mother admits that her son didn't want to be . with his father over the break while a neighbour reported seeing him . walking around hours after missing . 'We know some people are upset that we are even considering the possibility that Dylan may have run away. But we are working for Dylan and we owe it to him and to his family to consider every possible scenario that could have caused him to drop out of sight for a week,’ Dan Bender, La Plata Sheriff's office spokesman told KMGH. The missing boy is 5 feet tall, weighing 105 pounds, with blond hair, blue eyes and fair complexion. He was last seen wearing a blue-and-white Duke Blue Devils baseball cap, black Nike T-shirt and black Jordan tennis shoes. Dylan was picked up Sunday by his father at Durango-La Plata County Airport, his mother said on Friday. Dylan announced his arrival in a text message and ended it with an emoticon expressing a scowl, she said. Search: Dylan's friends believe that he may have tried hitchhiking to a nearby town to visit them . ‘I don't know if you can see this and I know you're not a big reader, so I will keep this short. We are all in Durango looking for you. I AM HERE and I will never give up looking for you. You are my ray of sunshine and the best kid a mother could ever have,’ she wrote in a Facebook post. Mrs Redwine added that the boy's father rarely exercises his right to see his own son, and she added that it would be out of character for Dylan to suddenly want to take a walk in the woods. 'Dylan is a generational kid and tech savvy,' she said. 'He wouldn't have gone to the mountains to pitch a tent or build a fire.' Mr Bender said that the search expanded on Saturday morning to include Bayfield, a town south of Vallecito. ‘I think that anyone who has a child can understand how devastated the family is,’ said La Plata sheriff Duke Schirard. ‘There's always hope until facts prove otherwise,’ he told the station.

Last week Central Japan Railway Co. (JR Tokai) revealed its Series L0 prototype, which it plans to operate on one of Japan's busiest routes from 2027. Maglev trains use magnets to lift the train above the track, eliminating friction to provide a faster and quieter service. Speed: The maglev train can hit speeds of 310mph and is expected to run between Tokyo and Nagoya. It will cover the 200 miles in just 40 minutes . JR Tokai says it aims to run the train between Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan's third largest incorporated city, on the JR Chuo Shinkansen Line, a route currently served by Japan's high-speed bullet trains. If approved, the new train will pass to the northwest of of Mount Fuji. Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism is examining the proposal. The service is planned to be expanded to Osaka by 2045 at an estimated cost of £64billion. The manufacturers claim that maglev technology is less polluting than the flights that currently link the cities. Mark 1: A test model maglev train from 2003. Officials claim the high-tech mass transit system is the future of travel . The new train features a streamlined nose similar to those on its bullet train counterparts, which reduces wind drag.

A patient at a private hospital awoke after an operation to find a nurse lying on the floor having a drunken nap. Nurse Janet Gill smelled strongly of alcohol and when the patient discovered her in his room at BMI The Duchy Hospital in Harrogate, Yorkshire. Ms Gill, who has a previous alcohol-related dismissal from another hospital, also falsely recorded giving the patient his medication, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard today. Misconduct: The Duchy Hospital in Harrogate where nurse Janet Gill was discovered slumped on the floor smelling of alcohol in a patients room . The male patient raised the alarm after finding Ms Gill slumped on the floor. Ms Gill was told to ‘sleep it off’ by a senior nurse before driving home after the incident in March last year. Helen Fleck, for the Nursing and Midwifery Council said: ‘Patient A was recovering from an operation overnight in the hospital. ‘He became aware during the night that somebody who appeared to be wearing a nurses uniform had entered his room, and appeared confused and didn’t know what she was doing. ‘She slumped down on the floor of the room and remained there. Obviously concerned by this, he pressed the patient alarm to alert other members of staff. ‘After investigating, the senior nurse noticed that Ms Gill smelt of stale alcohol and just didn’t seem with it.’ Strike two: The nurse, who has already been dismissed once over alcohol-related misconduct from another hospital, admitted being drunk on the job but not misadministering medicine (file photo) The patient complained to senior staff at the Duchy, who immediately checked his medication charts as a precaution. They discovered Ms Gill had recorded giving the patient his prescribed medication, despite the drugs still being in his room unused. Ms Fleck added: ‘The registrant remained on the premises that night because the senior nurse recommended she sleep off the alcohol before she drove home.’ Ms Gill admits to attending work under the influence of alcohol, being unfit to work and falling asleep while on duty but denies wrongdoing in regards to the false recording of the administering of medication to the patient. Ms Gill had been disciplined by hospital bosses for a similar matter two years earlier, the hearing was told. Ms Fleck said: ‘It became apparent that this was a registrant who had previously been reported for attending work under the influence of alcohol while working at the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton. ‘This occurred on October 4 2009, and the registrant made full admissions and presented certain mitigating factors to explain her conduct.’ Gill, who could be struck off from the profession, is not attending the hearing, claiming the decision had already been made.

It may only be the size of a grain of rice, but one species of beetle has managed to alter Canada’s climate. The mountain pine beetle has increased summer temperatures in British Columbia by around 1C by destroying huge areas of forest, according to research. By reducing the amount of water pumped into the air by vegetation, the beetle has had as big an impact on local climate as forest fires, say scientists. Destructive: The mountain pine beetle (pictured) has increased summer temperatures in British Columbia by 1C . The increase in temperature has resulted from the sun's energy heating up the ground surface instead of being used up evaporating water. The change in surface energy balance could alter cloud formation and rainfall, said the researchers writing in the journal Nature Geoscience. Over the past decade, infestation by the beetle has affected almost 20 per cent of the whole of provincial British Columbia, a region of some 105,000 square miles of pine forest. Threatened: The beetle has affected almost 20 per cent of British Columbia which has around 105,000 square miles of pine forest . Huge impact: The beetle has had as big an impact on local climate as forest fires (file picture) Scientists made the link between the beetle attacks and climate after studying satellite data. They found that throughout the affected forest, the beetle had reduced summer evapotranspiration - the movement of water from the ground to the atmosphere by plants - by 19 per cent. Author Dr Holly Maness, from the University of California at Berkeley, US, and colleagues wrote: ‘Land cover change in the case of insect infestation is less well ordered than in other types of disturbance, because both the scale of the impacted areas and the level of mortality within affected areas are variable. ‘Future work is needed to understand the circumstances under which patchy and variable forest mortality drive significant secondary changes in regional climate.’ Mountain pine beetles destroy pine trees by laying eggs under the bark. They also introduce a fungus into the wood that prevents the tree from repelling and killing the attacking beetle. The fungus stops the tree from getting the water and nutrients that it needs and the tree dies within a few weeks. Cold winters with temperatures as low as -40C can kill off beetle populations but the insects recover quickly and resume their attack. The recent warm summers and mild winters have played a significant role in insect survival and the worsening of the problem.","The beetle has had as big an impact on local climate as forest fires .

Marked for death: Ronald Post, 53, claims there are no accessible veins in his arms, hands or legs because he is so obese . A condemned killer trying to delay his execution because of his extreme weight may need to come up with another excuse after a judge rejected his request on Monday. Death row inmate Ronald Post, who weighs more than 400 pounds, is asking the courts to stop his January execution on the grounds his weight could cause him to suffer severe pain during the procedure. Post is prohibited from challenging his execution by injection because he raised similar claims in his first set of federal appeals in 1997, Judge Lesley Wells said Monday in Cleveland. In general, death row inmates are only allowed one federal appeal when alleging the same set of facts. Post 'has not demonstrated in his new petition that his medical condition has changed so significantly, or that Ohio's new lethal injection procedures have changed so radically, since he filed his first petition in 1997 that his original core complaints are transformed into something new,' Wells wrote. However, the judge sent the question to a federal appeals court in Cincinnati for a final determination according to federal law governing this type of appeal. The state is opposing Post's requests to delay his execution. Post, 53, was sentenced to die for the 1983 shooting death of hotel desk clerk Helen Vantz in Elyria. His execution is scheduled for January 16. Fears: Post is worried executioners at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility will not be able to find a vein because of his weight . Vantz's son, Bill, has called Post's arguments 'laughable.' Post also wants his execution delayed . to try to prove that claims he made a full confession to several people . have been falsely exaggerated. Post's attorneys declined to comment Monday. They have previously argued that Post's medical condition hasn't been stable. At issue, they say, is his condition around the time of his execution, not at the time of an original court challenge. Post 'could not have raised this claim in his earlier petition because the execution was not imminent and his physical and medical condition have not been stable in relation to an execution date,' his attorneys wrote in earlier court filings. Arguments: Richard Cooey, who weighed 267lbs at the time of his execution in 2008, argued his own case of being too big to die while holding prison food and limited opportunities to exercise responsible . Escaped death: In 1994 Mitchell Rupe, who weighed 400lbs while sentenced to death, had his sentence changed to life in prison after found too heavy to hang without risking decapitation . Post has also sued to stop his . execution as part of a long-running challenge of Ohio's execution . procedures in federal court in Columbus. Judge Gregory Frost has scheduled a December 17 hearing. The lethal injection, invented in 1977, is designed to kill a patient quickly and painlessly. The cocktail of drugs used varies from state to state, but generally it contains a barbiturate that induces a deep sleep; a paralyzing agent that halts breathing; and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. However, dosages vary by state, not by inmate; people are given the same dosage regardless of their size. As a result the lethal injection is not necessarily quick or painless, a 2007 study published in PLoS Medicine found. If any of the doses in the injection are off the patient feels pain but also may suffer a slow death by asphyxiation, according to the study. Molecular biologist Teresa Zimmers of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, told the Scientific American at the time: 'This idea that this is a painless procedure is completely wrong. It's just invisible because the person is paralyzed.' Post has tried losing weight, but knee and back problems have made it difficult to exercise, his lawyers say. They also say Post's request for . gastric bypass surgery has been denied, he has been encouraged not to . walk because he's at risk for falling, and severe depression has . contributed to his inability to limit how much he eats. A doctor who examined Post for his . defense team says Post does not have accessible veins in his arms or . hands because of his weight and could not receive a lethal injection in . his legs because he is so obese. Before his execution in 2008, 266-pound death row inmate Richard Cooey also claimed Ohio authorities would have trouble finding a vein in his flab. In a lawsuit, Cooey argued that he would suffer a painful . death by lethal injection because of his size. However, his execution passed without any recorded incident. In . 1994 in Washington state, a federal judge upheld the conviction of . Mitchell Rupe, but agreed with Rupe's contention that at more than 400 . pounds, he was too heavy to hang because of the risk of decapitation. Rupe argued that hanging would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. After numerous court rulings and a third trial, Rupe was eventually sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 2006.","Ronald Post worried his weight will mean he suffers severe pain during procedure .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:42 EST, 26 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:02 EST, 26 November 2012 . A horrified dog walker discovered the bodies of 11 puppies who had been skinned and then dumped in a public park. The dead animals were found in a bag that had been tossed along the side of the road in a Pennsylvania suburb. The incident is the second time that skinned animals were found in the state. DNA tests will be done to determine if the puppies are dogs, coyotes or some other domestic or wild animal, while necropsies will be conducted to learn how they died. Outraged: Animal rights advocates at the Lehigh County Humane Society are concerned after a bag of 11 skinned puppy corpses was found ditched near a park . A woman walking found the bodies Friday . in woods near a park in Lower Macungie Township, outside Allentown, the . Lehigh County Humane Society said. The bodies were in or near a bag that had been torn open, perhaps by an animal. Unless a witness comes forward, it's usually difficult to make arrests in animal cruelty cases, authorities said, meaning that both the culprit and the motive will remain at large. Victims: The dead pups were either coyotes (like the ones pictured here) or some breed of dog but it is difficult to tell post-mortum . 'It could have been kids or some . whacked-out person who found an abandoned litter of puppies or coyotes . and just thought they'd have some fun,' said Cary Moran, the county . humane society's shelter manager. 'That's what's so scary about not being able to (solve) these cases, and find out what happened, because you don't know who's out there. Because, unfortunately, animal abuse is a precursor to harming (people).' The discovery came the same week . another animal was found skinned, with its feet cut off and rope tied to . one leg, about 20 miles away in Lynn Township. That involved a larger animal, perhaps one sought for its pelt, according to humane society Officer Christine Wiggins. Two pairs of thin latex gloves were found beside that animal, and will be sent to a forensics lab. If . it proves to be a coyote, the case may amount to little more than a . citation for improper disposal, since it is legal to hunt coyotes in . Pennsylvania. But investigators think legitimate hunters would have disposed of the body properly. Ms Wiggins believes the two cases might be related, given that the animals were skinned. The . puppies appeared to be a few months old, weighing less than 10 pounds, . according to Ms Moran, who added that it's hard to know their age . without knowing the breed. An animal advocacy group has offered a reward for tips that lead to an arrest and conviction. 'Somebody purposely took time and precision and skinned animals, over and over. It's really disgustingly gruesome. I can't imagine what's going through somebody's head when this happens,' said David Lee of the Lehigh Valley Pitbull Awareness Club. Scene: Police are still searching for any clue over who killed the pups or why, as little was known when a woman found the dead bodies while walking her own dog in Lower Macungie Township . Neighbors and friends are often reluctant to report animal cruelty, fearing retribution, animal welfare officials said. This has proven true even in notorious cases in which animals are set on fire, the Pennsylvania SPCA said. 'Someone usually knows but is afraid to come forward. Often there are multiple witnesses who maybe feel intimidated to not `snitch,' said spokeswoman Wendy A. Marano. 'These are disturbing cases - not only are helpless animals suffering cruel fates, but it's unsettling to know that people capable of these kinds of depraved acts are members of our own communities.' Coyotes are now more common in Pennsylvania than black bear or bobcats, according to state game officials. The Pennsylvania Game Commission now allows them to be hunted and trapped to reduce their population. More than 43,000 coyotes were bagged in 2010, according to commission data.","Dead animals found in a bag ditched by a suburban park .

The parents of a three-year-old boy with cerebral palsy hope he will be walking by Christmas, after doctors said Botox could help relax the muscles in his legs. Aiden Farrell was diagnosed with the condition after he was born prematurely at 29 weeks. Over the years his leg muscles have tightened to the extent that he can no longer walk. Doctors told Aiden's parents Sara and Gevun Farrell, that the wrinkle-buster could help but there was a 12-month waiting list on the NHS. Aiden Farrell will have the life-changing treatment to relax the over-active muscles in his legs . The couple from Gosport, Hampshire, began fundraising to help pay for private Botox . treatment. Local residents helped raise £7,000 to pay for the treatment. But after the three-year-old’s condition worsened last month, the NHS will now carry out the treatment on December 14. The money raised will now be spent on intensive . physiotherapy for Aiden at the Bobath Centre in London. Although Botox first achieved fame as a cosmetic drug used by celebrities to smooth out wrinkles, it also has a number of medical uses such as treating migraines and incontinence. Botox uses tiny amounts of botulinum toxin, derived from the bacteria that cause botulism food poisoning. The deadly nerve agent kills by paralysing the muscles used for breathing. In tiny doses it relaxes the contraction of muscles in some people with cerebral palsy by blocking nerve impulses. This allows better control of movement and reduces the risk of muscle and tendon shortening. The effects tend to last from four to six months. Aiden's father (second left) and mother (third left) at a charity night held to raise money for Aiden . Mrs Farrell, 31, hopes the treatment could mean that Aiden will be walking on Christmas day. She said: 'It will be the best Christmas present ever. Aiden is such a happy little boy and so determined. 'I don’t think he’s properly aware of what’s been going on and what’s going to happen because he’s still very young.' Before Aiden's condition worsened he was able to walk a little with a walking frame and play with his two older brothers and older sister. Mrs Farrell, a part-time care assistant, said: 'As a mum I feel useless that I can’t do anything apart from massage his legs to take the pain away.' Said she had been humbled by the generosity of fundraisers. She added: 'It means everything because without everybody’s help Aiden wouldn’t be able to have the physio afterwards. 'If the treatment works and Aiden’s walking again and in less pain, it’s all thanks to everybody.I am so thankful to everybody that helped. 'I’m making Aiden a scrapbook with stories about the fundraising so when he is at an age he can understand, I can show him.' Mrs Farrell and Mr Farrell, a builder, 33, will take him to the physiotherapy centre for intensive therapy in January. Staff at the centre will teach Mrs Farrell how to continue the treatment at home. The remainder of the money will go on physiotherapy equipment and essential alterations to the family’s home. It is estimated one in 400 people in the UK have cerebral . palsy, where a part of the brain, usually the part that controls the . muscles and movement, is affected.","Botox relaxes the contraction of muscles in some people with cerebral palsy by blocking nerve impulses .
