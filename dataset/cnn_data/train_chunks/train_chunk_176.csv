"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Yet another passenger ship could be about to anchor in Hong Kong's popular waters, but berths aboard this particular vessel will be more permanent. New sketches from a company in the city on China's southern coast have proposed the creation of a floating cemetery. Designed as a possible solution to Hong Kong's shortage building space -- particularly for graveyards - Bread Studio has come up with ""Floating Eternity."" The structure would hold a rotating wall of 370,000 niches which are compartments allotted for people to place their urn containing the remains of their loved ones. Designed like a cruise ship, the floating cemetery would anchor along Hong Kong's coastline, docking at a designated pier for visitors who want to visit their deceased relatives. ""Architects are always made to think about life when designing buildings but not many think about death,"" said Benny Lee, a designer at Bread Studio. ""I was watching TV and saw a group of people encouraged by the government to scatter their loved ones' ashes in the sea and noticed that the boat they were using to transport people out was really small. I thought why not make that boat bigger, better and more enjoyable for families."" ""Floating Eternity"" would also offer amenities for its visitors. Complementing Chinese rituals that involve bringing food during cemetery visits, the floating cemetery plans to have a grass deck for people to set up picnics or a restaurant onboard. This would be particularly popular during the city's Cheung Yeung and Ching Ming Festival, where many Hong Kong residents pay homage to their deceased ancestors by spending their day at cemeteries. ""The design also focuses on plenty of greenery with bamboo gardens; something you don't see in the stony graveyards in Hong Kong despite them being chiseled into hills because there's simply no space,"" said Lee. The structure is also eco-conscious -- its columbarium wall, which would sit on a rail track, would be powered by tidal energy. This allows the walls to travel around the track giving all niches an equal chance for the best position on the cruise; an important aspect of feng shui - the art of placement prominent in Chinese culture - where the position of the lot affects the price for it. The concept is bizarre yet, it gives Hong Kong a glimpse into its near future. With its bay of glitzy skyscrapers and a population of over 7.1 million, space to build is increasingly scarce, and developers are being pushed out of packed central locations. Recently, a CBRE Global Research and Consulting survey named Hong Kong the world's most expensive retail space at US$3,863 per sf annum, topping New York. Hong Kong also has an aging population. According to the Hong Kong Consensus and Statistics Department in late July, the number of deaths is expected to rise from about 42,700 per year currently to about 82,400 at the end of the next 20 years. A shortage of space coupled with a rise in death rates has caused a shortage of plot space for the deceased and a subsequent rise in costs for it. ""A floating cemetery is the next natural step in Hong Kong's history of graveyards,"" said Lee. Cemetery sites have been evolving since the 1940s where the dead were buried in graves on flat land to the 1960s where feng shui dictated that some graves should be positioned on high hillsides near villages. Towards the 1980s, columbarium became the preferred place for the dead. Traditionally housed in temples, they offer locker-style compartments for people to place the ashes of their loved ones. Columbarium also took the form of buildings however, in recent years, people have objected to living in such close proximity to them and their rising prices (private columbaria costs in Hong Kong range between US$645 to US$25,604). As a result, illegal columbaria have mushroomed in various areas around Hong Kong. A maritime mortuary is yet to set sail along a coastline in any part of the world. However, there have been other unusual options for storing the dead. In Sweden, it is legal to freeze bodies in a posthumous bath of liquid nitrogen before blasting them and reducing them to powder. In Tokyo, Japan, mechanical tombs are used where families swipe smart cards to lift the urns from an underground vault and access the ashes of their loved ones; a solution Hong Kong was reportedly looking into three years ago. ""We're aware that the wall of columbarium on the floating cemetery will also, at some point, reach its limit so we suggest stacking up additional storeys on top of the wall,"" said Lee. ""But most importantly, it's a short-term alternative. Who knows, we could be seeing a sea of floating cemeteries in a few years from now.""

"(CNN) -- The next generation is just a few weeks away for the world's hottest smartphone without a piece of fruit on it. The Samsung Galaxy S IV will be unveiled March 14 at a New York event, the company announced Monday. The release will mark the latest assault in what's rapidly become a two-phone race for supremacy on the mobile landscape. Samsung confirmed the plans at Mobile World Congress, the massive tech show currently under way in Barcelona, Spain. Samsung unveiled a new tablet there but, taking a page from Apple's playbook, opted not to roll out its flagship phone during the crowded event where many rival products are clamoring for attention. ""We introduced the Galaxy S III in London last year, and this time we changed the venue (to New York) ... as we were bombarded with requests from U.S. mobile carriers to unveil the Galaxy S IV in the country,"" J.K. Shin, the head of Samsung Mobile, was quoted as saying by Korean media. The company followed with a post on Twitter containing the less-than-subtle message, ""March 14. Ready 4 the show?"" The post linked to a promo inviting people to ""come and meet the next Galaxy."" Details on the new phone's features are scarce, although analysts expect that it will have a higher-resolution screen. All but the most ardent of tech pundits have abandoned the idea that a mythical ""iPhone killer"" will emerge from Apple's bevy of competitors. But in the Galaxy S III, the fragmented field of phones running on Google's Android operating system found a champion: a single gadget to put forward for an apples to apples (if you will) comparison to the iconic iPhone. And the results can't have made folks in Cupertino happy. How Samsung is out-innovating Apple . In the third quarter of last year, the Galaxy S III became the first smartphone to outsell the iPhone. The Galaxy S III shipped 18 million units worldwide in that three-month span from July to September, compared with 16.2 million for the iPhone 4S, according to research by Strategy Analytics. With the release of the iPhone 5, Apple retook the lead in the final months of 2012, selling an estimated 27 million. But the S III hung in there with another 15 million units sold. The companies have also been engaged in a nasty $1 billion patent battle. And Samsung has stepped up its advertising in a major way, with Apple squarely in its sights. The Korean company was a sponsor of Sunday night's Academy Awards telecast, and it and Apple went head-to-head with big advertising buys during the broadcast.","Samsung says its Galaxy S IV phone will be unveiled March 14 .

"(CNN) -- Defending champion Serena Williams edged towards another milestone with the 49th WTA Tour title of her career on Sunday, coming from behind to beat Jelena Jankovic in the final of the Family Circle Cup in South Carolina. The world No. 1, who is seeking to become only the 10th woman to have reached a half-century, triumphed for the third time on the green clay at Charleston as she won 12 of the last 14 games. The American, who had a similar run in vanquishing Maria Sharapova to claim a record sixth Miami title last weekend, posted a 3-6 6-0 6-2 victory in just under two hours. Jankovic, herself former top-ranked player but 18th going into this event, had hopes she might repeat her 2008 Rome win on red clay over Williams as she won a 45-minute opening set. But, after an argument over the Serbian apparently trying to take her serve too quickly, the 15-time grand slam champion stepped up a gear to control the match. ""I felt so close in that first set. I felt like I could have been up 3-0,""said Williams, the only woman to have won more than $40 million in prize money. ""She was playing really, really well, but it was just a shot here, a shot there, and she played really well in the big points. And I had so many opportunities that I missed. She took advantage of that, and she went on to glory in that first set. ""After that I just got really relaxed and was like, 'Serena, you have to chill out and not get crazy and if you win, great. If not, you're trying. Just do the best you can.' "" She won despite double-faulting on her first match point and hitting the net with a forehand on her second, but still managed 27 winners against 13 unforced errors in those last two sets, having been 12-123 in the first. The 31-year-old, who beat older sister Venus in Saturday's semifinals, took her career record to Jankovic to 6-4 and extended her record to 75-4 since the start of the 2012 clay season a year ago. Jankovic had won 14 of her last 16 matches, reaching the semis in Miami and winning the 13th title of her career in Colombia. ""I thought I played pretty well in that first set -- I was holding my serve and then waiting for my chance to break,"" Jankovic said. ""In the second set I had 40-15 in that first game and then again in another couple of games I had 40-15, 40-0. I should have focused and gotten those games."" Meanwhile, the Czech Republic became the first team through to the semifinals of the men's Davis Cup competition on Sunday, completing a 3-1 win over Kazakhstan in Astana. Lukas Rosol won 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 over Evgeny Korolev to earn a home clash with Argentina in September. It also put the defending champions top of the ITF nation rankings, ending Spain's four-year reign. Argentina went through with a 3-2 win at home to France, as world No. 71 Carlos Berlocq upset 13th-ranked Gilles Simon 6-4 5-7 6-4 6-4 in the decisive rubber. World No. 8 Jo Wilfried-Tsonga had leveled the tie by earlier beating Juan Monaco 6-3 6-3 6-0. In the other quarterfinals, Serbia won 3-1 against the United States as world No. 1 Novak Djokovic battled to a 7-5 6-7 (4-7) 6-1 6-0 victory over Sam Querrey in Idaho. Djokovic suffered an injury scare when he twisted his ankle in the third game of the match, but was able to continue with painkillers while the usually strong-serving Querrey struggled with his own shoulder problem. The Serbs took a 2-1 lead in Saturday's epic doubles rubber, as Ilija Bozoljac and Nenad Zimonjic defeated top-ranked Bob and Mike Bryan 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (7-1) 5-7 4-6 15-13 in a match lasting almost four and a half hours. Serbia, the 2010 champions, will next face Canada or Italy. That quarterfinal was 2-1 in the home team's favor after Saturday's doubles in Vancouver.","World No. 1 Serena Williams defends her title at the Family Circle Cup in Charleston .

"(CNN) -- The mainstream media -- you know who you are -- are rooting for immigration reform. They like the idea of doing something to accommodate the country's 11 million undocumented immigrants, who, despite conservative rhetoric to the contrary, were never going to be banished. They swoon over the kind of bipartisanship that brings together John McCain and Marco Rubio on the one hand and Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer on the other. They believe the Republican Party needs to moderate its harsh rhetoric about immigrants -- if only to salvage its political future -- and are welcoming the GOP's new realism. But is that enthusiasm causing media organizations to overestimate the prospects for reform? Watch: Steve Kroft Plays Defense Over Hillary/Obama Lovefest on '60 Minutes' Any bill still must pass the Republican House, which has been a graveyard for numerous Obama reforms. The Senate has always been a place where top lawmakers reach across the aisle more easily than in the polarized House, as was evident during the fiscal cliff debacle. And there are conservative groups determined to derail any path toward citizenship, which they view as amnesty. It's not that journalists are acting as cheerleaders for the emerging plan. But when the media have qualms about an issue, they couch it as being ""controversial"" and ""risky"" (say, George W. Bush's plan to privatize Social Security). Opinion: Immigrant - Can we trust Obama? By contrast, look at the way the president's immigration speech in Las Vegas was covered: . The New York Times: ""Seizing on a groundswell of support for rewriting the nation's immigration laws ..."" The Washington Post: ""Obama added to momentum on Capitol Hill in favor of an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws ..."" We saw the same supportive approach when the Pentagon lifted a ban on women serving in front-line combat positions, which, despite some conservative opposition, was greeted with favorable features that largely depicted the move as long overdue. Watch: Should N.Y. Times Have Censored Company Name Over the S-Word? As with many perpetual Beltway disputes, the contours of a common-sense compromise on immigration have been clear for some time. The right wants tougher border enforcement and employer verification procedures. The left wants undocumented immigrants taken out of the ""shadows,"" as Obama put it, and given a chance to become openly productive members of society. The key are the tradeoffs. How long would a path to citizenship take? Are fines and back taxes required? How do we ensure that those who broke the law don't get an unfair advantage over legal applicants? I don't argue with the standard political analysis that the moment may be ripe for immigration reform. Watch: Media Seize on Emotional Moment of Gabby Giffords' Testimony . Mitt Romney, who talked about wanting immigrants to ""self-deport,"" got clobbered among Hispanic voters. The GOP has lost the popular vote in five of the past six presidential elections. Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator, says he has ""evolved"" on the issue, and he's not alone. The conservative media may be a bellwether here. After Obama's Tuesday speech, Hannity's leadoff guest was Karl Rove, the former Bush lieutenant who favors the Senate compromise. And when Rubio, the Florida senator and son of Cuban immigrants, called in to Rush Limbaugh's show, the host -- while criticizing Obama -- told him, ""What you are doing is admirable and noteworthy. You are recognizing reality."" Watch: BlackBerry 10: Is It a Hit or All Thumbs? But illegal immigration remains a divisive subject that still arouses visceral opposition among some Americans. Capitol Hill is a place where partisan maneuvering can push the government to the brink of default. And as George W. Bush learned in his second term, hammering out a compromise on such a volatile issue is maddeningly elusive. Perhaps the election changed the landscape and both parties will find a way to compromise. In the meantime, it might be wise to take the upbeat media coverage with a healthy dose of skepticism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Howard Kurtz.","Howard Kurtz: The mainstream media are rooting for immigration policy changes .

"(CNN) -- In just a few days, Jorge Bergoglio has shown that as Pope Francis he will be the kind of approachable, down-to-earth man that people yearn for in a spiritual leader. Like the Dalai Lama and Bishop Desmond Tutu, he smiles easily and appears to walk comfortably through the world. He showed his humanity on his first full day in office as he suddenly left the Vatican to visit Rome's main church, the Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, and then stopped by the hotel where he had stayed before the recent conclave to pay his bill. Like any major political leaders who communicate with symbols and gestures, Catholic hierarchs use style and stagecraft to reach their followers. The conclave and then the presentation of the new pope have been refined, as theater, over more than a thousand years. The secrecy surrounding the selection of the pontiff and the pomp accompanying the announcement from the balcony produce the kind of drama that rivets the world even in an age of technological distraction. Who isn't awed by the sights and sounds of a hundred-thousand people gathered in St. Peter's Square, awaiting and then greeting the man chosen to lead 1.2 billion people? Opinion: A humble, authentic and credible pope . Just as we are meant to be affected by religious stagecraft, we are also practically hardwired to seek the meaning in a leader's every move. When Francis visited Santa Maria Maggiore he met briefly with Cardinal Bernard Law, who recently stepped down as archpriest of the basilica. A decade ago, when he was archbishop of Boston, Law was a notorious figure in the scandal that arose around the sexual abuse of children by priests. As scores of victims accused him of failing to protect children from predatory priests, he became the only bishop to resign because of the abuse crisis; he then fled to Rome. But while many Boston Catholics consider Law a disgraced figure, his fellow bishops have continued to respect him and, in reaching out to him, Pope Francis appeared to echo this solidarity. Opinion: Pope Francis is no herald of big changes . This can be seen as a reminder to the world that the Catholic Church remains under the control of men who were appointed to high office by the archconservatives John Paul II and Benedict XVI and share a commitment to the orthodoxies that have alienated so many modern Catholics. On the status of women, priestly celibacy, contraception and sexuality, Francis is as firmly rooted in the past as his predecessors. For example, during the debate that eventually resulted in gays in Argentina being allowed to marry, then-Archbishop Bergoglio mounted a fierce campaign against this equality. He argued that Satan himself was the author of a reform he called ""a machinization of the 'Father of Lies',"" and that children and families would be harmed by the change. While he was archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio spoke often of the poor and called attention to the many ways that modern societies push people without status to the margins. In this way, he reflected Christ's affiliation with the outcasts of his time. However, even as he spoke for the powerless, Bergoglio also consistently aligned himself with powerful conservative politicians seeking to oust the government headed first by Nestor Kirchner and later by his wife, the current President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner, and which enjoyed wide support from the middle and lower classes. Time and again he invoked God in his political campaigns and suggested the other side was somehow less holy. As he engaged in politics, Bergoglio emphasized the special status claimed by the church as an agent of his God, which, he implied, makes it superior to all other institutions. When he became Pope Francis, Bergoglio expressed the same sentiment in his very first formal remarks, delivered at the Sistine Chapel. There he warned that without emphasizing its religious base the church runs the risk of becoming ""a pitiful NGO"" (nongovernmental organization). Navarrette: Pope pick a signal to Latino Catholics . For those who respect NGOs such as Amnesty International and the Red Cross, Francis' choice of words -- ""pitiful NGO"" -- was a stinging reminder that this man with the humble style cannot resist claiming superiority based on supernatural beliefs. This is the great contradiction of the new pope. On the one hand he criticizes hypocrisy in the church and shows his discomfort with the trappings of power. On the other, he shows disdain for social institutions and leaders that compete with the church for influence and authority. The dichotomy represented by the values espoused by Christianity and an imperial church is what makes so many people uncomfortable with official Catholicism. Francis embodies this conflict. Stylistically, the world is getting a far more approachable, Christ-like man who understands the compassion and empathy people crave from spiritual leaders. However, Francis' record appears to indicate there will be no real changes where it matters -- on the status of women, power-sharing, sexual ethics -- and thus huge numbers of Catholics will remain alienated. The biggest risk the Church faces today is irrelevance, and while the new pope's style means he'll get a hearing, what he has to say about issues that matter the most is unlikely to make the institution any more relevant than it was before him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael D'Antonio .","Michael D'Antonio: In Pope Francis' first days it's hard not to plumb meaning of his gestures .
He says among them was a visit with disgraced Cardinal Law, implicated in sex abuse scandal .
He says in this and other moves, he's shown commitment to orthodoxy of church hierarchy .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi authorities hanged 21 men after they were convicted of terrorism, the nation's Ministry of Justice reported Tuesday. The ministry said those executed were involved in kidnappings, assassinations, bombings, and the killings of security officials and civilians. Some of them had carried out attacks by planting bombs and rigging cars and motorcycles with explosives. Amnesty International said the death penalty was suspended after the 2003 invasion but quickly restored by the first Iraqi government. Executions resumed in 2005. Since then, at least 447 prisoners have been executed, including Saddam Hussein, some of his main associates and alleged members of armed groups. Hundreds of prisoners await execution on death row. The country, where 129 prisoners were hanged in 2012, is now one of the world's leading executioners, according to Amnesty International. Ahead of elections, more violence . With provincial elections scheduled to take place in five days, attacks have persisted. Politicians are worried that violence could discourage Iraqis from heading to the polls. Police and health officials in Kut told CNN that three people were killed and four others were wounded when a car bomb exploded at a security checkpoint southeast of Baghdad on Tuesday. The area is mostly Shiite. In Tarmiya, north of the capital, a car bomb exploded at a police patrol and killed a bystander and wounded five people, including three officers. This comes after Monday's bombings across Iraq that left at least 51 killed and more than 266 wounded, health and police officials in Baghdad told CNN on Tuesday.","The men were convicted of terrorism .

"(Oprah.com) -- Are you truly happy? If you were presented with a group of people you've never met, could you determine who was really satisfied with their life? A panel of five people took a test to see how happy they really are. Based on this picture and a brief description, see if you can tell who is the happiest! From left to right: Peggy, Noreen, Lachelle, David and Lorrie. Peggy (pictured on far left) is a 44-year-old married mother of two teenage boys who works as the bookkeeper of the family business. Last year, both her father and her sister died, and her mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Noreen (second from the left) is a 52-year-old divorced mother of two college kids. She's an avid swimmer and works in the operations department of a major airline. Lachelle (middle) is 27 years old, married and has no children. She works two jobs and has two dogs. Last year, four of her friends and two of her family members died within six months of each other. David (second from the right) is 53 years old, and he's been a funeral director for 30 years. He is married and has two sons. Lorrie (pictured on far right) has been married for 15 years and has six children. She works in retail and also serves as the vice president of her PTA. Peggy, David and Lachelle scored the highest on the satisfaction scale, while Noreen and Lorrie scored the lowest. Satisfaction for Peggy is achieved by surrounding herself with happiness. The most important thing? Her husband. ""He is there for me. He doesn't only love me, he appreciates me and makes me feel good,"" Peggy says. Happiness doesn't depend on money, she says. It's about enjoying the simple things. ""Every morning I have a ritual. After the boys have left, [my husband and I] get in the hot tub, and it's our time. We talk about what is going on for the rest of the day. It is just our quality time just to stay connected."" David, the funeral director, says he's developed phrases that help him keep a positive outlook. ""I will say, 'It's a marvelous Monday. It's a terrific Tuesday,'"" he says. Although he deals with death daily, David says his job is anything but depressing. ""Most people look upon funeral service as a sad profession. I look upon it as a profession where I'm helping people at a very difficult time in their lives,"" he says. ""Being successful in life is not what really matters. Being significant in life is really the core root of what matters."" Lachelle says she lives by the philosophy, ""Negative out, positive in."" She says she believes happiness is a conscious effort. ""It's about claiming what's yours. If you want a positive life, you need to think positively and act positively,"" she says. ""I do my best not to compare myself with others. I've always felt that what one person has may not be destined for me."" Dr. Robert Holden has dedicated his life to studying the pursuit of happiness. The psychologist is the founder of the Happiness Project in England and the author of 10 best-selling books, including ""Happiness Now!"" Dr. Holden says those looking for happiness often don't realize they already have it. It's a lesson that he says he was lucky to learn at age 18 from a spiritual teacher. ""He said, 'Look, actually, Robert, you're already happy.' And I said, 'Well, that's great, but I don't feel it. So tell me, what do I have to do?'"" Dr. Holden recalls. ""And he said, 'You have to understand that the pursuit of happiness is a mistake. It's like, you don't chase happiness out there. You learn that you're happy inside you, and then you go running. Then you go into the world.'"" When looking at the guests who scored the highest on the happiness scale, Dr. Holden says he instantly recognizes the keys to their satisfaction. For David, it's his job. ""Your job just helps you to have a great perspective on life, which is, 'We're just here for a short spell, and it's really important to make the most of it,'"" Dr. Holden says. Lachelle uses the law of attraction to stay happy, Dr. Holden says. ""Lachelle, basically what I see is that you've chosen to be an optimist. You have had some difficult times in your life, and you've had bad circumstances, but you've made great choices. And this is how the law of attraction works,"" he says. ""What I found is that basically we have beliefs about life, and our perception gathers evidence to prove that our beliefs are right. So an optimist believes that good things can come from bad situations."" After taking the happiness test, Noreen found that she received the lowest score possible -- a 5 out of 35. So how can Noreen find fulfillment? Dr. Holden says to look within her heart. ""What really occurs to me is ... you are such a good person. ... But I realized that you've not made some of the best choices in your life in the past,"" Dr. Holden says. ""Those choices, I think, are being motivated really by a lack of what I call self-acceptance, which is where we somehow don't believe we deserve any more than we have."" The law of attraction could make a big difference for Noreen, Dr. Holden says. ""The way the law of attraction works is that as we increase our self-acceptance, we attract more happiness,"" he says. Dr. Holden says Noreen needs to realize she is, indeed, a great person. One way she can do that is to surround herself with people who already know that. ""I think it's also great to have some friends around you who can remind you, because we do forget,"" Dr. Holden says. Noreen says she feels like she's taking her first step on the road to happiness. ""I feel like I'm starting. I can feel it,"" she says. Lorrie scored in the middle range of the satisfaction test and says people often mistake her for being happy because she puts on a false front, whether she's being a room mom for one of her six children or attending a PTA meeting. Dr. Holden gets to the root of her dissatisfaction. ""You're so good at helping everybody else, I think you're in danger of leaving yourself out of your own life,"" Dr. Holden says. ""What we have here is a classic what I call a martyr ethic, which is where we're putting everybody else first instead of ourselves."" In fact, Dr. Holden says Lorrie can help herself and give an important gift to her family -- her own happiness. ""I know you ... want your children to be happy, and I tell you this: You can't just tell them to be happy. You show them with your example. And that's the big key,"" Dr. Holden says. Lorrie can start today by simply asking for help. ""I think the big mistake here, and it's a common one, is that we try to do our lives by ourselves,"" Dr. Holden says.

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The man convicted of killing British student Meredith Kercher has given an interview from his Italian jail cell, insisting Amanda Knox is a ""sweet girl"" incapable of murder. Raffaele Sollecito, who was sentenced to 25 years for his role in Kercher's death, told an Italian newspaper that he was struggling to come to terms with the verdict and feared going ""insane"" in prison. Asked if his former girlfriend Knox -- also convicted of Kercher's murder and jailed for 26 years -- was capable of killing, Sollecito told Il Messagero: ""It is absurd and inadmissible. She is a very sweet girl."" Sollecito's lawyer Luca Maori, who acted as an intermediary for the newspaper, confirmed to CNN that the interview had taken place and was reported accurately. American student Knox and Italian Sollecito were convicted last week of murdering Kercher, who was found with her throat slit in the apartment she shared with Knox in the Italian town of Perugia. Both, and another suspect found guilty in a separate trial, are appealing. Speaking from his cell in Terni prison in central Italy, Sollecito maintained his innocence and blamed his conviction on a ""media campaign."" ""I was certain that the verdict would put an end to a nightmare. Instead, it didn't,"" he said. ""When the sentencing was read, I didn't understand what was happening and even now it seems impossible and still don't understand why I was convicted."" Sollecito said he was no longer in love with Knox but still felt close to her. ""She is also in a nightmare and a harrowing situation like mine."" He also rejected claims he and Knox had acted inappropriately by shopping for underwear after Kercher's murder -- an incident that was cited as an example of Knox's lack of emotion following her roommate's death.

"(CNN) -- A massive explosion at a fertilizer plant Wednesday night left much of the small town of West, Texas, in ruins. Even as the nation mourned the victims of Monday's bombings in Boston, the new disaster left hundreds of people in West injured, homeless, and in need of help. ""These are our neighbors, they are coming to help,"" Waco Police Department Sgt. William Patrick Swanton said Thursday. ""You will find that in Texas. You will find that across the United States. We put everything aside when it comes to these types of situations."" Here's what you can do. Give blood . With more than 160 people injured and others unaccounted for, the need for blood is great and will increase. Currently The Blood Center of Central Texas and Texas Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster are asking primarily for O positive, O negative and type A blood. The Red Cross of Central Texas has a complete list of area locations currently taking blood donations. Shelter, food and clothing . The Salvation Army quickly mobilized in Texas to provide food, drink and emotional and spiritual care to the survivors and first responders in West. It has set up several locations in and around the town. In addition to nourishment and counsel, the Salvation Army has set up a Joint Assistance Center, where returning residents can register for case work and assistance with the Salvation Army and other agencies. The best way to assist The Salvation Army's efforts is through financial donation, which you can do here. In addition, Texas Gov. Rick Perry's website has a list of shelters currently taking in victims as well as a list of local organizations taking donations of clothing and other helpful items. The Texas Rangers are also collecting donations and other items at some upcoming games. Connect with loved ones . The Red Cross has activated its ""Safe and Well"" website locally in West, so if you are looking for a loved one you have not been able to reach, or if you are a victim and cannot reach your family to let them know you are OK, please use this website. In addition, the government has established a hotline for information on victims and survivors: 254-826-4115. There are also numbers for all of the local hospitals available on Perry's website. Make Donations . Baylor University is fifteen minutes away from the town of West and consider all of its residents as their neighbors. University spokesperson Lori Fogleman said that thirteen students, forty-three faculty and staff and two hundred and sixty-two alumni call West home and so the university is pledging to support this town in its recovery. They've established the West Relief Fund and will collect donations for specific projects deemed necessary by city officials in West. ""Absolutely 100% of the profits will go back into the city of West,"" Fogleman said. They will work together with city officials to determine what is needed and then students and faculty will lead groups in completing each project using the funds the university has raised. The National Fallen Firefighters Relief Foundation has established a fund to assist the survivors and coworkers of those first responders who died in the tragedy. The local fire station and its equipment was also badly damaged and is asking for donations of gear. If you do have something you wish to donate, please contact them at www.firehero.org/contact . The Society of St. Vincent dePaul's is also collecting both monetary and material donations. They are sending disaster case management teams to meet with survivors throughout the recovery process.","Hundreds were injured in Texas fertilizer plant explosion .

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Vote counting began here Monday after largely peaceful elections in which millions of voters stood in line to choose their next president in a tightly contested general election. The Elections Commission said some of the nation's 30,000 polling stations would remain open late to accommodate those still in line and to make up for having opened late. ""Definitely, there is going to be some hiccups here and there, but I think, when you assess the whole, then we think the work, so far, is very good,"" said Abdullahi Sharawi, a commisssioner of Kenya's Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. ""I think all Kenya, it looks like they have faith in the system, in the new constitution."" Though some people waited in the sun for more than eight hours to cast their ballots, there was ""no reporting at all"" of intimidation, said John Stremlau, the Carter Center vice president for peace programs. The center, at the invitation of Kenyan authorities, placed 60 observers in all 47 counties. In Nairobi, some lines stretched for more than a kilometer (0.6 miles), he said. But the observers' initial reports were ""universally complimentary to the citizens of this nation in showing their determination to have their votes counted,"" Stremlau said. Those glitches that did occur appeared related to a new system of computer-based biometric identification of voters, he said. ""Sometimes a couple of computers would get kind of out of whack and would slow the process down,"" he said. Residents were eager to avoid a repeat of the last election, in December 2007, when the nation plunged into ethnic violence after results were disputed. Some 1,200 people were killed and 600,000 displaced. ""There have been so many steps and safeguards put into the system so far to prevent that kind of cataclysmic event that we're kind of encouraged that that is not going to happen,"" said Stremlau. Carter Center observers were not in the country during the 2007 vote. Hours before the polls opened, a group of heavily armed men attacked a police post in the port city of Mombasa, killing at least 10 people, including two police officers, officials said. David Kimaiyo, inspector general of Kenyan police, said a group of men approached police officers manning a post between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. and refused to comply with orders to stop. Police fired on the men, who fled into a nearby slum, he said. When police called for backup, about 200 men ambushed them on a road, Kimaiyo said. Prime Minister Raila Odinga blamed the attack on the Mombasa Republican Council, a separatist group that wants Mombasa, the second-largest city in Kenya, and its surrounding coastal area to secede. Stremlau said the violence may have been unrelated to the election. Party agents representing the two main coalitions contesting the elections will let observers and everyone else know if they have concerns about the violence being linked to the election, Stremlau said. ""They can be adjudicated by the courts, as needed,"" he said. Elsewhere, ETV correspondent Soni Methu told CNN that her crew came across the bodies of five people at a polling station in the coastal town of Kilifi. Two of the bodies were wearing police uniforms; one had on a Kenya Wildlife Service uniform, Methu told CNN. In Mandera -- near the border with Somalia and Ethiopia -- witnesses said bombs exploded at two polling stations. Red Cross Mandera Coordinator Abdi Ahmed said three people were slightly wounded. And in the Kenyan town of Kitengela, south of Nairobi, at least 20 people were hospitalized after a stampede at a polling station, CNN affiliate NTV reported. But voting in the rest of the country was largely peaceful. ""We want a leader who would be mindful of people who are living below the poverty line,"" one enthusiastic young man told CNN as he waited for his turn to vote. ""You see, the majority of Kenyan people live below the poverty line, so we want a leader who will be mindful of these people."" Read why this election is important . The stakes are high. After the 2007 election, the government boosted security and set up an ambitious new constitution, making this election one of the nation's most complicated polls since the country gained independence from Britain in 1963. Eight contenders are vying for the presidency, including front-runners Odinga, the prime minister; and his deputy, Uhuru Kenyatta. Read about the main players . Polls show a tight race, raising the possibility of a second round of voting. Kenya's constitution calls for a runoff within a month of the results if no candidate gets more than half of the vote. Reforms, changes . After the last election, the nation also revamped various political systems, including the constitution, the electoral process and the judicial system. The new system aims to empower citizens and local governments, thereby ensuring a peaceful election. ""It is one thing to change the constitution, but we have to change our underlying issues of ethnic sentiments that have dated years,"" said Mark Kamau, who lives in the capital, Nairobi. After the last election, Odinga disputed results that declared the winner to have been the incumbent president, Mwai Kibaki. Odinga alleged the election had been rigged. Protesters took to the streets, where supporters of both camps fought one another. More than 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced -- the worst violence since the nation gained independence. Optimistic, but prepared . Leading up to this election, the candidates declared they would settle any election disputes in court. Candidates have implored their supporters to avoid bloodshed, no matter the vote's outcome. But some citizens remained wary. ""I don't know what possessed people last time,"" Kamau said of the violence. ""I hope there will be no violence. I'm waiting for Kenya to restore my faith this time."" But as he waits, he is prepared. His refrigerator is stocked and his car is filled with fuel. ""Just in case,"" he said. ""You never know."" 'My main issue' The economy, security and the fight against corruption, which is rampant in the country, are among voters' top concerns in the election. The election also poses a challenge: Kenyatta has been indicted by the International Criminal Court for allegedly inciting a local militia to conduct reprisal attacks in the last election. He has denied the charges. His running mate, William Ruto, also faces ICC charges. Though Kenyatta nevertheless enjoys widespread popularity, some voters expressed fear that the international community will isolate the nation if a candidate facing ICC charges is elected. Dominic Muia, 35, was in line at 5 a.m. to cast his ballot in the town of Nakuru. ""My main issue is the economy,"" he said. ""I'm voting for Uhuru (Kenyatta) because he is younger and has a better vision to move the country forward."" At 51, Kenyatta would be the youngest Kenyan president ever. Odinga is 68. 'Things an average citizen worries about' Harrison Mario, 37, said his vote is based on issues and policies, and will go to Odinga. ""Basically, he has been fighting inequality."" he said. ""He has been campaigning for the less fortunate. His manifesto focuses on security, education and food -- things an average citizen worries about."" Both leaders are campaigning on almost the same policies, leaving the more than 14 million registered voters to choose based on criteria that include personality, ethnicity and links to political parties. ""I don't know that much about their differences, so I'm voting for the candidate of my favorite political party,"" said Susan Kamau, who lives in Nairobi. ""In short, I'm voting on loyalty to my party, not issues."" In addition to the presidential race, the nation will also pick governors, senators and a slew of other local candidates under the new constitution. Dynasty . Whoever wins, the race evokes memories of a political dynasty. Kenyatta's father was the nation's founding president, while Odinga's father was his vice president in the 1960s. Both started out as allies in the fight for independence from Britain, but they had a falling out that led Jomo Kenyatta, a member of the Kikuyu tribe, to force out Jaramogi Odinga, a Luo tribe member, as his vice president. Their history has strained relations for decades between Kikuyus and Luos. Nima Elbagir and Lillian Leposo reported from Nairobi, Nic Robertson reported from Mombasa, Faith Karimi reported and wrote from Atlanta.","NEW: ""The work, so far, is very good,"" says elections commissioner .

"(CNN) -- As a veteran of combat in Vietnam, I am often asked about current wars. Recently I have been asked about soldiers posing with corpses or urinating on corpses in Afghanistan. The ""patriotic"" media wants us to understand what it is like to be a soldier in war, not to condone the conduct but to ask ""who are we to judge?"" They want to know about rules of war: ""Are there rules about taking pictures with dead bodies?"" When I see these pictures, I am not shocked. I have similar pictures from Vietnam. And I'm in them. Such pictures are part of our warrior culture. Not everyone takes them, but they are not in any way unusual. Look at the famous photos from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. The U.S. soldiers aren't looking over their shoulders. None of them appears worried about being caught doing something wrong. They all look comfortable, often smiling for the camera. This tells me that the behavior captured in the photographs was S.O.P. (standard operating procedure). What I find most disconcerting is all this attention to what is done to these dead bodies and absolutely no question or curiosity about why they are dead in the first place. No questions about why U.S. troops are still in Afghanistan at all. The idea of having ""rules of war"" assumes that there is a proper and civilized way to conduct warfare. I find the idea ludicrous. We teach our children to solve their problems without fighting, not by fighting according to rules. For the most part we practice what we preach. The county I live in sued a city that wanted to build a cement plant. The county didn't want the pollution. A court ruled in favor of the city, and the county lived by the ruling. The county didn't send the sheriff's department in to kill some city residents. Florida is suing Georgia for diverting too much water to Atlanta. Neither state is likely to call out the National Guard if it loses the case. So why is it that when nations have disputes, we must accept that they will murder and maim each other's citizens? The conduct of soldiers in war is made up of violent behavior that is criminal behavior outside of war. War is when we allow our loved ones to murder and destroy and then wonder that they are so traumatized. Misconduct hurts morale, Panetta warns troops . In Vietnam, I lost my first friend at a place known as Alpha North. It was my third week; it changed who I was forever. I realized then and there that my life and the lives of my friends were really at risk. We were in a place where it was the job of the people who lived there to kill us. There was no second chance, no time out. This was for real. As was typical of our troops, I lost all empathy for the Vietnamese. They all looked the same, and I couldn't tell the ones who liked us from the ones that wanted us dead. As is also typical in such situations, I chose to err on the side of safety. ""F*** the Vietnamese!"" was my attitude. We all knew (or thought we knew) that the life of one Marine was worth more than the lives of all of the Vietnamese put together. If we are going to talk about rules of war, it doesn't make sense to start with the soldiers and Marines who have been put into that situation. They will all tell you that the first rule is to stay alive. Most people, when asked to choose between obeying the rules, if they believe that harm or death will come to them and their loved ones, or breaking the rules, if they believe it will keep them and their loved ones safe, choose to break the rules. The question is hypothetical to most people, but not to a soldier in combat. Instead, if we're going to talk about rules of war, we have to start with the powerful people who chose to put those soldiers there. The No.1 war crime is starting a war, because all other war crimes emanate from that first crime. I have not been to Afghanistan, but there are some evident similarities between the war there and the war in Vietnam. Call it Vietghanistan. Both are wars of occupation. The people of both countries looked different from us, resulting in racial profiling. They are all suspects, a word that carries a suggestion of guilt. Neither war has had an actual plan for winning. When people ask me if we could have won the war in Vietnam, I say that I was taught that the duty of a Marine is to destroy the will of the enemy to resist the authority of the United States of America. The way a Marine performs that duty is to make the price of that resistance more than the enemy can afford. Opinion: Don't demonize our troops . In Vietnam ""Body Count"" was the measure of success. I was told that if we killed 10 Vietnamese for every American, we would win. We more than met that goal without, of course, winning. But our rule was ""might makes right"" -- a philosophy that my father had taught me the United States had defeated in World War II. It seems to be alive and well. In Afghanistan, the United States supposedly invaded to arrest one man. Last year we were told he'd been executed in Pakistan. What is the mission now? My mental wounds are more painful than my physical wounds. The cream of my generation was wasted in the rice paddies of Vietnam. All of the sacrifices we made bought nothing but a black marble wall in Washington. It pains me greatly that my country did not learn from Vietnam that it should never again to waste its children on wars of choice, but instead use civilized nonviolent methods of conflict resolution. Today my country perpetrates the same crimes against my children's generation. This is unbelievably hard for me to take. Do we really believe that having rules on how we can murder each other in war makes the murdering clean, acceptable, and civilized behavior? If we developed rules for rape or slavery, would they be acceptable too? Should we bring back dueling and regulate individual murder? Why is murder on a large scale treated so differently from other outrages? I am told that killing people in war isn't murder, because it is sanctioned by the government. This reminds me of former president Richard Nixon saying ""when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal."" In warfare, the overwhelming majority of those who suffer and are killed are civilians? Does calling them collateral damage really mitigate those losses and make them acceptable? Not to me. What about the laws on our books that forbid war? The Kellogg-Briand Pact bans all war. The United Nations Charter legalizes two types of wars, neither of which matches most of our current wars. Our wars are neither defensive nor authorized by the U.N. Security Council. And the U.S. Constitution forbids wars not declared by Congress, which has not declared a war since 1941. As long as we are willing to accept war as a legitimate means of conflict resolution, we must be willing to accept the facts that go with war. Mothers, fathers, aunts and uncles, grandparents and children will die and be maimed both physically and mentally. Some of them will be in uniform, but the majority of them will just be ""collateral damage."" Our family members will come home with physical, psychological, and behavioral problems. We will continue to have military and VA hospitals with waiting lines. Preparing for these wars means continuing to train our children to hurt and kill other humans. This involves a process of dehumanization that is in conflict with the training required to produce good citizens in a democratic society. In my training at Parris Island, the citizen was taken out of me and I was rebuilt as a Marine. We had a prayer that we recited every night when we hit the rack: . ""Another day in the Corps, Sir, for every day is a holiday and every meal is a feast. Pray for war. Pray for war. God bless the Marine Corps. Pray for war. God bless the Commandant. Pray for war. God bless the drill instructors of 353. Pray for war."" Are we really willing to continue to accept all of this? My organization, Veterans For Peace, believes that our stories are our strength. We believe that by educating the public by relating our personal experiences, we can reveal the hard, ugly truth about war. Our collective experience has taught us that war is futile and immoral. We believe that it is abhorrent to think of human beings as ""collateral damage,"" and we refuse to be silent as our government continues to pursue illegal, immoral wars of aggression. We believe that if the public really saw and understood the truth of war as we do -- they would end it. As long as we continue to accept war as an acceptable means of conflict resolution, things will remain the same. Work for peace.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If, by some extraordinary feat of filmic conjuring, you somehow spliced Death Race 2000, Back to the Future and Priscilla: Queen of the Desert, editing out the violence, time travel and transvestism, but keeping in the racing, futuristic cars and Australian scenery, you'd probably end up with something vaguely resembling the Panasonic World Solar Challenge. Now celebrating its 20th anniversary, the Challenge is the world's premier long-distance race for solar-powered vehicles, with competitors traveling 3000 kms along the Stuart Highway from Darwin in the far north of Australia to Adelaide in the south in cars powered solely by sunlight. In the process they not only pass through some of the most spectacular and inhospitable terrain on earth -- temperatures in the Australian outback can exceed 50 degrees Centigrade -- but also send out a strong environmental message, pushing forward the boundaries of green technology and promoting the benefits of solar power as an alternative energy source. The fact that the race is also, in the words of one competitor, ""a bloody good laugh,"" only adds to its appeal. ""It's a great adventure,"" the race director Chris Selwood told CNN, ""One that allows the bright young people of the globe to come up with creative solutions to the problem of sustainable transport, while at the same time to drawing attention to the importance of lightening the environmental footprint of our personal transport needs."" First run in 1987, the race was the brainchild of Danish adventurer and environmental campaigner Hans Thostrup, who in 1982 designed and built ""Quiet Achiever,"" the world's first ever solar-powered car. The inaugural competition featured 23 teams, with the winning vehicle -- the General Motors-sponsored Sunraycer -- completing the distance at an average speed of 67 kilometers per hour (42 miles per hour). Things have moved on somewhat since then. Thostrup sold the rights to the race to the South Australian Government in 1996, and what was initially a triennial event -- i.e. held every three years -- went biennial (every two years) in 1999. The average speed has shot up to 103 kph (64 mph) -- in the 2005 race the winning car achieved a top speed of 147 kph (91 mph) -- while the competition has expanded to incorporate several different classes of vehicle: the Challenge and Adventure Classes for exclusively solar cars, and the Greenfleet Technology Class for other types of environmentally friendly, low-emission vehicles. This year's race, which left Darwin on October 21, features teams from 18 countries, including entrants from as far afield as Venezuela, Senegal, Malaysia and Japan.  See photos of this year's cars » . There are 47 cars in all, 37 of them solar-powered -- 20 in the Challenge Class (maximum 6 square meters of solar panels) and 17 in the Adventure Class (eight square meters of panels) -- and 10 Greenfleet Competitors. ""It's not so much about how fast you can go,"" explains Selwood, ""But rather how far you can go on limited energy. ""Unlike traditional motor racing the focus is on the cars themselves rather than the people who actually drive them."" It is very much a young person's adventure -- the majority of entrants represent schools and universities, with an average age in the early 20s -- although participation would be impossible without grants and corporate sponsorship. ""There's a $3000AUD ($2697) entry fee,"" explains Selwood, ""And for a team of eight people it would typically cost about $30,000 AUD ($26,965) to mount their campaign once they've actually got to Australia. ""On top of that you've actually got to design and build the car, which could cost anything from $50,000 AUD ($44,944) to $2.5 million AUD ($2.25 million)."" In 2001, 2003 and 2005 the Challenge Class -- the competition's Blue Riband event -- was won by Nuon a team from the University of Delft in the Netherlands, and it is they who are currently leading this year's event. ""We've had eleven people working full time on the car since December 2006,"" says Nuon's Tine Lavrysen, ""So we dearly want to win. ""There's a lot of pressure on us."" The race itself is lasts eight days, although faster competitors such as Nuon are expected to reach Adelaide in closer to five. The cars set off each morning at 8 am, and drive until 5 pm, when they stop and camp at whatever point they have reached that day. ""Last time an all-girls school team camped by the road near the ranch of one of the richest men in Australia, who shall remain nameless,"" says Selwood. ""When he found out they were there he invited them all up to his mansion for dinner. That's the sort of thing that happens."" Each team carries an official observer with them, is allowed up to four drivers per vehicle, and is required to travel with a safety car both in front and behind to warn other traffic of their presence, although for much of the Stuart Highway there is little other traffic to warn. ""It's difficult to grasp the remoteness,"" says Selwood. ""Especially in the Northern Territories. It's just a straight road with the occasional road-house (rest stop) and road-train (giant lorry), but very little else. ""Except, of course, the wonderful Australian scenery."" Since 1987 the original aim of the competition -- simply to design and build a solar-powered car that could cross Australia -- has had to be modified and adapted as technology has become increasingly sophisticated. ""The original challenge of creating a solar car that could cross the continent has been well and truly met,"" says Selwood. ""This year we have sought to re-establish the challenge and make things a little bit more difficult. We have introduced different classes of car, cut back the number of solar arrays that are allowed, and introduced other rules such as the driver having to sit upright in a normal driving position, and having to get in and out of the car unaided. ""It's all designed to get the teams thinking, see how far they can push the technology. That's what the competition is all about, giving kids an opportunity to be creative."" While the fruits of that creativity may not look especially car-like -- with their arrays of solar panels most of the entries resemble nothing so much as giant silicon chips on wheels -- they are nonetheless driving forward, quite literally, a quiet revolution in energy efficiency. ""A normal petrol engine is about 25 percent efficient in terms of energy use,"" explains Tine Lavrysen. ""Even the best ones are only about 50-60 percent efficient. The motor on our solar car, on the other hand, is 95 percent efficient."" Although competition for the cherished World Solar Cup is fierce, it is the technological challenge posed by the event that really motivates the teams. ""In university you get to design a lot of things, but only on paper,"" says Lavrysen, who is studying industrial design engineering. ""Here you can actually build something and run it, which teaches you an awful lot."" There's also the sheer enjoyment of taking part. ""It's an extremely fun, friendly competition,"" says Lavrysen. ""Everyone gets on with everyone else, and helps out if anyone has problems. ""Although the Umicore team from Belgium are our main rivals at the moment, we had a barbecue with them last night, and lent them a drill when they had a problem with their steering column. ""It's all very good natured. Although we'll still be upset if we don't win."" ........................................ Could solar cars replace petrol vehicles? What's the future for transport?

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Prosecutors fighting to keep American student Amanda Knox behind bars for murder in Italy defended on Monday the DNA tests that linked her to the killing of British student Meredith Kercher. Knox is appealing her conviction and 26-year sentence for the murder of her housemate in 2007, with her defense team arguing that DNA evidence used in her original trial is not conclusive. This summer two new forensic experts, professors Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conti, cast doubt on the DNA evidence that played a role in the convictions of Knox and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito. ""I think the prosecution is trying to take the independent experts' testimony away and frankly, I don't see that happening,"" Knox's father, Curt, told reporters after court adjourned Monday. ""I mean, I think the independent experts have done a very good job in evaluating the information ... and I don't see it breaking down at this point. I see that it has been good for Amanda."" Patrizia Stefanoni, the Italian state police forensic expert who conducted the initial DNA examination presented at Knox's trial, testified Monday regarding the methods and equipment she used. Stefanoni told prosecutor Manuela Comodi she was using older equipment at the time. While police now have better equipment that can analyze smaller amounts of DNA, she said the testing methods remain the same. Authorities testified in 2009 that a knife found in Sollecito's home had traces of Knox's genetic material on the handle and Kercher's in a tiny groove on the blade. DNA on Kercher's bra was also traced to Sollecito. Vecchiotti testified that the knife tested negative for blood and the amount of DNA said to be Kercher's was so low, it could not be examined again with any conclusions. Vecchiotti and Conti also said there was no evidence the knife had been ""thoroughly washed,"" as prosecutors argued during the trial. Stefanoni said according to the protocol she used, the amount of DNA on the knife was sufficient and clearly attributable to Kercher. She said the new experts have equipment capable of examining very small DNA samples and that testing should have been done. ""Stefanoni has thoroughly and calmly clarified the principal elements of the work she carried out -- in a clear manner, given the complex subject ... during the examination at the time,"" Francesco Maresca, attorney for the Kercher family, said Monday. ""I think she managed to get the court's full attention and to have damaged the independent forensic work."" Vecchiotti and Conti also said the clasp from Kercher's bloodied bra, which allegedly contained Sollecito's DNA, was ""dirty"" and had been allowed to rust, making further testing futile. The evidence, the two argued, should be ""inadmissible."" Stefanoni is expected to testify about the bra clasp Tuesday. She testified Monday that she wore anti-contamination equipment when examining the DNA evidence. ""The appeals trial is very different from the first trial, obviously,"" Curt Knox said Monday. ""And I see that, especially with the appeals trial asking for an independent review ... with the way the information came back from the independent experts, I see that this is turning (in) Raffaele and Amanda's direction."" Asked about his daughter, he said, ""I got to hug her for a few seconds. She is anxious. She is happy that court is back in session again. It has been a long summer for her, knowing that she is innocent. ... She is anxious, she is hopeful and she is looking forward to a decision hopefully by the end of this month."" As the appeal heads into its final weeks, Kercher's sister on Sunday urged people not to get caught up in the details but to ""please remember our beautiful Meredith."" ""Amongst the media frenzy that has developed throughout, Meredith has been forgotten because she is no longer with us, yet this should be about her and what really happened on that tragic evening,"" Stephanie Kercher said in a statement distributed by Maresca, the family attorney. Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009 of killing Kercher, 21. Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years in prison. A third defendant, small-time drug dealer Rudy Guede, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast, was also jailed in connection with Kercher's death. He was sentenced to 30 years for murder and sexual violence following a fast-track trial in 2008, but his sentence was later cut to 16 years. Kercher, a British exchange student, was found dead, seminaked and her throat slashed in the villa she and Knox rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia. The two professors have said records about the machine that did the DNA testing were missing, suggesting the testing process itself may have been unreliable. On Monday, prosecutor Comodi said the records had been found and asked the judge to admit them as evidence. The defense argued they should not be admitted because they were not in the files originally given to the new experts. Comodi said Vecchiotti and Conti could have had them if they had asked for them. Forensic experts for the two sides are expected to return to the stand Tuesday. This stage of the appeal is scheduled to run at least through Saturday. Final arguments and summations are expected this month. Kercher's sister Stephanie said the family was feeling ""great concern as the rumours surrounding the original DNA evidence findings are spreading."" She said it was difficult for Kercher's family to understand how the evidence, so carefully developed and presented at trial, could be deemed irrelevant, and also to understand how a small amount could be useless when there is no determination of how much should be present. Knox's defense seems ""to focus and rely heavily on these two pieces of DNA evidence, but can we just remember for a moment what this case is actually about: my sister, a daughter brutally and selfishly taken from us nearing four years ago ... not a single day goes by that we can grasp any peace or closure."" She urged the public to remember the blood-splattered crime scene as well as 10,000 pages of evidence presented in the case. ""We still have confidence in the Perugia police and every faith in all those involved in court and the investigation,"" Stephanie Kercher said. Her family is asking that the appeals court assess each piece of evidence, ""both scientific and circumstantial, as well as any witnesses who have taken the stand independently of any other information or media."" Maresca said Monday that Kercher's family has faith ""in the whole baggage of evidence"" aside from evaluation of the DNA on the knife and bra clasp. ""Please do not let Meredith die in vain,"" Stephanie Kercher said. ""Her courage and strength fight on and we will seek justice so she can rest in peace."" Her sister, she said, put up a fight for her life and did not give up, ""and we will not give up now.""

"(CNN) -- A storm system unleashed a tornado that slammed communities in northern Arkansas, damaging homes and destroying a church, officials said Wednesday evening. At least three injuries were reported in Van Buren County. Some 33 homes and a business were damaged in the county, said Tommy Jackson of the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. The tornado demolished the sanctuary, fellowship area, classrooms and a pavilion at Botkinburg Foursquare Church, its pastor told CNN. ""If the tornado would have come an hour and a half later we would have been caught in it,"" said Senior Pastor Ester Bass, referring to Wednesday night services. No members of the church were injured. A passing motorist who parked his truck in the church drive-through to get out of the dangerous weather had a close call, however, when the storm struck. ""It shook the truck and just lifted the roof right off the drive-through,"" said Bass. ""He was all right."" Bass, 63, said his congregation of about 100 was left stunned. ""It is just devastating. My wife and I are just torn,"" Bass said. ""We put a lot of sweat and hard work and it was paying off. The church was growing."" As church leaders prepared to meet with their insurance adjuster, the pastor was thankful for a loyal membership. ""They will be with me,"" said Bass. ""They are ready to buckle down and do what we have to. With the Lord's help, we are going to rebuild."" According to the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center, a Van Buren County highway was blocked by fallen trees and an 18-wheeler truck was overturned. John Robinson, a meteorologist in the National Weather Service's Little Rock office, said the tornado tracked from the community of Scotland to Botkinburg. ""It weakened fairly soon after that,"" he said. Another storm formed after that. Damage also was reported in Viola in Fulton County, near the Missouri border, and in Conway, Lincoln and White counties. About 15 homes were damaged in Izard County, Jackson said. Storm spotters reported damaged and overturned vehicles along U.S. 65, north of Clinton. Video footage from CNN affiliate KATV showed toppled trees and twisted building girders at one damage location. Scotland, according to Robinson, suffered a fatality and major damage to a highway and homes in a major February 2008 tornado. The severe weather season started late in Arkansas, according to Robinson, because of a chilly March. ""It has been a very slow year."" Thus far in 2013, six tornadoes have been reported, about half the normal number.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A Thai criminal court has sentenced a Thai-born American to 2 1/2 years in prison for insulting the monarchy, the latest case involving controversial laws for defaming, insulting or threatening the royal family. Joe W. Gordon, whose Thai name is Lerpong Wichaicommart, cooperated during the investigation of his case and pleaded guilty, resulting in a lenient sentence, his lawyer said. But the charge of writing and posting articles insulting the monarchy under the Southeast Asian country's lese majeste laws can yield a sentence as high as 20 years in prison in the Buddhist country, where the king is highly revered. ""A chokehold on freedom of expression is being created in the name of protecting the monarchy,"" Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a report published December 2 on the laws. King Bhumibol Adulyadej has pardoned foreigners in similar cases in the past. The lawyer, Anon Rumpa, said he plans to file for a royal pardon. Speaking to reporters after the verdict, Gordon said he was ""an American, not a Thai citizen."" An ""American has rights and freedom to comment. In Thailand, there is limitation in expressing opinion,"" he said. Gordon, 54, returned to Thailand last year after 30 years in the United States. He was arrested in May for posting a link on his blog to an unauthorized biography of the king, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission. He has been detained without bail since then. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States regards freedom of expression as a fundamental human right, ""so we are troubled by the outcome of this case"" ""We also have no higher priority, as you have often heard from this podium, than the protection of American citizens abroad, so we are engaged with the Thai authorities and consular officers from our embassy in Bangkok are in touch with Mr. Gordon and his family,"" Toner said Thursday. He said the United States has conveyed its views on the case to Thai authorities and doesn't see the incident ""adversely affecting the overall relationship."" Elizabeth Pratt, consul general at the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok, called the sentence ""too high for just expressing his free speech."" ""We also respect the law of Thailand. We are trying to help Mr. Gordon in any way that we can."" The Human Rights Watch report cited a sentencing of a 61-year-old man to 20 years in prison for sending four text messages considered offensive to the queen. It said ""many other harsh punishments"" for violating the laws have been rendered in recent years. ""The severity of penalties being meted out for lese majeste offenses in Thailand is shocking,"" Adams said. ""The new government seems to be responding to questions about its loyalty to the monarchy by filing countless lese majeste charges."" Human Rights Watch said the government has launched ""a major campaign against alleged violations"" of the laws since Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra took power last summer. ""The roots of the recent campaign appear to be found in the September 2006 military coup against Thaksin Shinawatra, the prime minister at the time, who was considered by royalists to be insufficiently loyal to the monarchy,"" the report said. Yingluck Shinawatra is Thaksin's sister. The rights group said private people and entities ""often misuse"" the laws for political reasons. It has called on Thailand ""to amend the laws so that private parties cannot bring complaints of lese majeste since no private harm is incurred."" ""The heavy-handed enforcement of lese majeste laws has a devastating impact on freedom of expression in Thailand,"" Adams said. ""A broad-based discussion is urgently needed to amend the laws to ensure that they conform with Thailand's international human rights obligations.""","NEW: State Department spokesman says U.S. ""troubled"" by case outcome .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The websites of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and of El Al, the Israeli airline, were brought down Monday morning by an apparent hacking attack. An internet hacker who calls himself Ox Omar sent an e-mail to the Jerusalem Post Monday in which he claims that together with a hacking group calling themselves ""Nightmare"" that the websites of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and that of El Al would be brought down. Idit Yaaron, the spokeswoman for the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, told CNN that the main site of the stock exchange where the trading takes place was not harmed and operates on a very high level of Internet security. Trading has continued unaffected, she said. A secondary internet web site was affected for a short period of time. El Al spokesman, Ran Rahav, released a statement saying, ""El Al is aware that for the past two weeks a cyber war is raging against Israel. The company is closely monitoring the Saudi hacker activity. El Al is taking precautions regarding its website and as a result there may be disruptions in the activity of the website."" The ""cyber war"" started at the beginning of the month when a group claiming to be Saudi Arabian hackers posted the credit card information and other identifying data of thousands of Israelis on line, prompting an international investigation. ""Hi, It's Ox Omar from the group xp, largest Wahhabi group of Saudi Arabia"" read a statement posted on an Israeli sports web site the group hacked into. ""We are anonymous Saudi Arabian hackers. We decided to release (the) first part of our data about Israel."" Wahhabism is an Islamic religious movement. The Bank of Israel released a statement last Tuesday saying that, based on information from credit card companies, only around 15,000 credit card numbers were exposed and those credit cards were blocked for use in Internet and phone purchases. Yoram Hacohen, who heads the Israeli Law, Information and Technology Authority at the Israeli Ministry of Justice, told CNN in a phone interview on Friday that he is more concerned about the private information that was released than the actual credit card numbers; he fears that the publishing of e-mail addresses, phone numbers and home addresses could lead to identification theft. Hacohen said that hacking is a criminal act against citizens and the Israeli authorities have begun a criminal investigation, including a computer forensic probe to search for electronic evidence in an attempt to locate the group. The theft of personal information is a criminal act under Israel's Privacy Protection law. Hacohen acknowledged that in the digital world, offenders are difficult to track and authorities are asking for international help in the matter. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon, speaking at a public event, called the Saudi hackers attack ""a breach of sovereignty comparable to a terrorist operation and (it) must be treated as such."" A few days later his own website was targeted in a cyber attack. In a statement on his Facebook page, Ayalon wrote that ""Muslim extremists"" hacked into his website ""to try and prevent me from continuing to do my work on behalf of the State of Israel, especially my online public diplomacy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu created a National Cyber Directorate in 2011, noting the emergence of cyber attacks that could ""potentially paralyze life systems -- electricity, communications, credit cards, water, transportation, traffic lights."" He said in December that the new agency -- along with a rocket defense system and a physical fence -- would help protect Israel against its enemies.","Saudi hackers say in an e-mail they attacked the sites .

"(CNN) -- Police are investigating the gang-rape of a tourist in central India, the latest black eye for the country over violence against women. A Swiss couple was camping near a forest in India's Datia district when a group of men beat the husband and raped his wife, the district's deputy superintendent of police, R.S. Prajapati, told CNN. There were between five and seven attackers, he said. The couple arrived in Mumbai on February 3 and were on a cycling tour across the country, said D.K. Arya, deputy inspector general of police. The attackers stole a laptop, 10,000 rupees (US $185) and a mobile phone, he said. The victims went to police and the woman was hospitalized and later released. Twenty people have been detained for questioning, Arya said. The couple is staying at a guesthouse in the Datia district while the investigation unfolds, he said. The Swiss ambassador to India, Linus von Castelmur, has spoken with the couple and offered any support they will need. ""Their health and treatment is the priority of the moment,"" the ambassador said in a statement. ""The embassy has also been in touch with the local authorities and has requested for swift investigation and for justice to be done."" The attack comes at a time in India when there are calls for stricter laws on sexual assault and changes in cultural attitudes toward women. In December a 23-year-old woman was gang-raped on a New Dehli bus, spurring protests in India, where most women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations. That woman later died in a Singapore hospital. A panel appointed by India's home affairs minister as a result of the case criticized Indian attitudes toward sexual assault and called for policy changes, including creating an offense of gang-rape punishable by at least 20 years in prison, making it a crime for police to fail to investigate sexual assault complaints and making it illegal to consider character or previous sexual experience of the victim at a criminal trial.

"London, England (CNN) -- A piece of rock legend Jimi Hendrix's guitar, teak from China, a salad server and a plank of wood from a newly constructed London Olympic venue. Each item of this unusual collection of materials has its own unique history and now they have been put together to create a new sailing boat. The 30-foot yacht launched Monday in Emsworth, Hampshire on England's southern coast, is made up of hundreds of precious items which have been donated by people across the country's south-east. 'The Boat Project' is a part of the region's contribution to the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad, which bills itself as the largest cultural celebration in Olympic history. ""Many people don't get to be exposed to the Games unless they have a ticket to an event,"" says boat builder Mark Covell. ""This gives more people the chance to be a part of the celebrations and the cultural history of the Olympics."" Covell knows firsthand the thrill of being part of the Games -- having won a silver medal in Sydney in 2000. The Olympian has been involved in the project from the beginning. It's been two years in the making and Covell compares the scale of the project with his own Olympic preparations. ""It was an enormous task,"" explains Covell. ""You needed to go above and beyond."" In all 1221 wooden objects were donated, and every single one has gone into the construction of the vessel. They range from treasures people have come across over the years in their travels to family heirlooms. The result is a yacht that is not only unique in her make up, but also in her sailing capabilities, says Mike Barham, who will captain the yacht. ""She's much faster than a normal 30 ft yacht,"" he explains. ""She's a cross between a high performance dingy and a high performance sailing boat."" The donated items were collected over six months by organizers who visited 20 locations across south east England. Once laid out, the goods filled an entire carpark. ""The amount of precious things that were given has been really inspiring,"" says Covell. Steve Ashmore is one of the hundreds who donated goods. The graphic designer contributed a piece of wood from a block of wood known as a tro, which was used by fisherman to haul their fish up the beach in Hastings, in south-east England. ""I wanted to give something from the place I was from,"" he explained. Ashmore is in a unique position, not only has he helped in the physical make up of the boat, but he's also a part of the crew of volunteers for the boat's maiden voyage, all of whom have been nominated by their friends and family. ""I want the voyage to do the whole project justice,"" the novice sailor says. ""So many people have put time, creativity and love into it."" The crew have been in training in recent weeks for their maiden voyage which will take them around the south east region. It will finish up at the London 2012 Olympic venue in Weymouth, Dorset in August, where it will remain on display throughout the Games. Even without taking to the water Covell says 'The Boat Project' has embodied the spirit of the Olympics. ""It's been the community who've donated their items and a community of volunteers who've built her and will sail her,"" Covell says. ""And bringing the community together is an Olympic ideal.""","1200 donated wooden objects have been used to make the yacht .

"Washington (CNN) -- A compromise proposal to expand background checks on gun sales lacks enough support to win Senate approval now, which will likely delay a vote on the measure that has strong public support, one of the sponsors told CNN on Monday. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, acknowledged the vote on the amendment he worked out with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania was being pushed back to try to build more support. Asked if the vote would take place Tuesday or Wednesday, as supporters had hoped, Manchin said he didn't think so. ""I would say by the end of the week, probably,"" he added. The Manchin-Toomey compromise had been scheduled as the first amendment to be considered as part of gun legislation pushed by President Barack Obama and Democrats in the aftermath of the Newtown school massacre in December. Last week, the broader gun package received 68 votes, including 16 from Republicans, to bring it to the Senate floor. Before discussion on the legislation began Monday, Manchin told CNN there was more work to do. ""We've got to work hard and the more people know about the bill, the more people read the bill, the more people see the facts of the bill, it breaks down all the misnomers,"" he said of what he called misinformation about the background check proposal being spread by opponents. Both Manchin and Toomey are self-professed gun lovers who have gotten high marks from the powerful National Rifle Association for their voting records on firearms issues. However, the NRA opposes their compromise, casting doubt on whether it can get the 60 Senate votes necessary to pass under the filibuster threshold imposed by Republicans. Far fewer Republicans than the 16 who voted last week to open debate are committed to backing the Manchin-Toomey amendment or supporting the final gun package. So far, four GOP senators have declared they will support the Manchin-Toomey compromise or were leaning toward backing it. With at least two moderate Democrats from pro-gun states known to oppose the measure, it needs at least seven GOP votes to have any chance of passing. Gun rights group endorses background check deal . The amendment will be one of perhaps dozens to be debated on the broader package of gun laws drafted in response to the killing of 20 first-graders and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The package also contains measures to crack down on gun trafficking and straw purchases, and to find ways to improve school safety. On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney sought to keep up the pressure on senators to approve the expanded background checks, noting polls show about 90% of Americans support such a move. ""If they vote no, they will be siding with the 10% and not the 90% in the United States that support background check legislation,"" Carney told reporters. In debate expected to last two weeks, senators will consider efforts by both sides to either expand or weaken the gun package. Republican Sen. Collins will support Manchin-Toomey gun compromise . A push by Democrats for an updated ban on semiautomatic firearms modeled after military assault weapons, as well as limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, is expected to fail. Republicans will push an NRA proposal to make state concealed weapons permits acceptable nationwide, a concept opposed by many Democrats. Since the Newtown attack by a lone gunman, Connecticut and a few other states have passed tougher gun laws. While polls show Americans favoring expanded background checks and other proposals intended to crack down on gun trafficking, more pro-gun states have passed laws easing firearms restrictions. In addition, the NRA has promised political retribution for legislators who back measures it opposes. ""This debate in some ways is underscoring just the extent to which there is a polarization in our society,"" Toomey told CNN on Sunday, lamenting ""the acrimony that has gotten into politics."" Asked if he was concerned about political repercussions, the conservative Republican said: ""I'll just let the political chips fall the way they fall."" In a separate interview on CBS, Manchin acknowledged the power of the NRA, saying: ""They won't be with us on this and I just would hope that they would allow their members to see the facts and let them vote their conscience."" Both senators said Monday that part of the problem involves misconceptions about their compromise, and they urged colleagues to read the 49-page measure instead of relying on what they called erroneous political rhetoric by opponents. Their amendment expands background checks to gun shows and all Internet sales, but exempts private transactions such as hunting rifles traded among family and friends. Co-author of gun compromise says Senate support an 'open question' It also makes it easier for hunters and sport shooters to transport their firearms across state lines. It would also require states and the federal government to provide records on criminals and the ""violently mentally ill"" to the national background check system, addressing a criticism by the NRA and other opponents of gun laws that the existing system lacks substantive information. In addition, the plan calls for a new National Commission on Mass Violence to report in six months on ""all aspects of the problem, including guns, school safety, mental health, and violent media or video games."" The NRA opposes the compromise as a possible first step toward a national gun registry and therefore a violation of the constitutional right to bear arms. However, smaller pro-gun groups have come out in favor of the Manchin-Toomey amendment, indicating a rift in the gun lobby over the emotional issue of taking legislative action in response to the Newtown killings. Manchin said Monday he was reaching out to senators who voted last week against beginning debate on guns. ""We're working on all of them. Some of them who might not have voted for cloture might be more receptive once they see the facts,"" he said. ""Now that we have gun groups coming out in support, it really helps us."" Manchin and Toomey noted Monday that their proposal includes a specific prohibition against a national gun registry as well as criminal penalties for misusing background check information for that purpose. In a statement on Sunday, moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said she would support the compromise because it exempted private family gun transactions from needing a background check, calling it a ""commonsense approach"" that required the screening only for commercial transactions. No sense of urgency: Rocky road ahead for gun legislation in the House . Even if the compromise passes and the Senate proceeds to approve a broader gun package, it was unclear if the Republican-led House would go along. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has stopped short of promising a vote, saying only that the chamber would look at whatever the Senate sends over. Obama has made the gun legislation a major focus of his second term, holding events across the country to push for congressional action and public pressure. Last weekend, the mother of one of the Newtown schoolchildren killed in December delivered the weekly presidential address instead of Obama. Francine Wheeler, whose 6-year-old son Ben died in the attack by a lone gunman, noted that since the December 14 killings, ""thousands of other Americans have died at the end of a gun."" ""Thousands of other families across the United States are also drowning in our grief,"" Wheeler said. ""Please help us do something before our tragedy becomes your tragedy."" The issue has raised attention on overall gun deaths in the country, with supporters of tougher gun laws noting that more than half all homicides involve firearms and U.S. levels are higher than other countries. On Saturday night, a man shot himself to death during a NASCAR event sponsored by the NRA in Texas. CNN's Kevin Liptak, Gregory Wallace and Kevin Bohn contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen.

"ANKARA, Turkey (CNN) -- President Obama ended his first overseas trip in Turkey -- a location he said he chose to send a clear message. President Obama and Turkish President Abdullah Gul hold a joint news conference Monday. ""I'm trying to make a statement about the importance of Turkey, not just to the United States but to the world,"" Obama said at a joint news conference Monday with Turkish President Abdullah Gul. ""This is a country that has been often said lies at the crossroads between East and West. It's a country that possesses an extraordinarily rich heritage but also represents a blend of those ancient traditions with a modern nation state that respects democracy, respects rule of law and is striving toward a modern economy."" Obama said Monday that the United States and Turkey can send a powerful message to the world through their friendship. ""I think that where there's the most promise of building stronger U.S.-Turkish relations is in the recognition that Turkey and the United States can build a model partnership in which a predominantly Christian nation, a predominantly Muslim nation -- a Western nation and a nation that straddles two continents,"" he continued, ""that we can create a modern international community that is respectful, that is secure, that is prosperous, that there are not tensions -- inevitable tensions between cultures -- which I think is extraordinarily important.""  Watch Obama on the importance of the U.S.-Turkish relationship » . U.S. approval ratings among Turks hit dismal lows throughout the Bush administration, largely because of the war in neighboring Iraq, which was widely unpopular in Turkey. The Turks seem to be captivated, however, by the new American president, according to one influential newspaper. On Monday, the Hurriyet published a front-page headline saying, ""Welcome Mr. President. ... Our hearts have been broken over the last eight years, now it is time to mend hearts."" Middle East analyst Reza Aslan said Monday that following years of frosty relations, Obama wants to strengthen ties with Turkey to send a signal to other Muslim nations. ""Turkey is the most important majority-Muslim state when it comes to the United States' interest in the region,"" he said. ""He wants to make the U.S.-Turkey relations the bedrock for the way in which he's going to reach out to the rest of the Muslim world,"" Aslan added. Obama said Monday that ""one of the great strengths of the United States"" is that it does not consider itself ""a Christian nation or a Jewish nation or a Muslim nation. We consider ourselves a nation of citizens who are bound by ideals and a set of values. I think modern Turkey was founded with a similar set of principles."" In an address before the Turkish Parliament later Monday, Obama acknowledged that ""the trust that binds the United States and Turkey has been strained, and I know that strain is shared in many places where the Muslim faith is practiced."" Obama said, ""So let me say this as clearly as I can: The United States is not and will never be at war with Islam.""  Watch what Obama says about Islam » . On his first presidential visit to a Muslim country, Obama highlighted that he too had Muslims in his family and had lived in a Muslim-majority country. Obama also called on Turkey, NATO's only Muslim member country, to work side by side with the United States to resolve conflicts across the turbulent Middle East. The president reiterated American support for Turkey's bid to join the European Union, a position that was recently criticized by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Obama's visit to Turkey is an ""important step for the president."" ""Turkey is a very important country -- one of our critical members of NATO. They play an important role in helping to support troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan. They will hopefully play a role in helping to bring about a Middle East peace settlement,"" he said. Turkey sends ""a very important signal to the rest of the Muslim world that the United States is not anti-Muslim as so many have thought we have been, but rather here is a very strong Muslim nation that is working hand in hand with the United States,"" Cohen said. Obama on Monday avoided pushing for a pledge he made during his presidential campaign to recognize officially the massacre of ethnic Armenians in 1915 as a genocide. Turkey vehemently denies Armenian claims that 1 million Armenians were killed in the last days of the Ottoman Empire. Instead, the American president highlighted recent diplomatic progress made between the governments of Turkey and Armenia, saying he was ""not interested in the U.S. tilting this negotiation in any way."" Turkey and Armenia do not have formal diplomatic relations and their borders are closed. However, last fall the Turkish president went to a soccer match in Armenia, and Armenia's top diplomat was expected to attend a U.N.-sponsored ""Alliance of Civilizations"" forum Monday in Istanbul, Turkey. Obama hinted that a major diplomatic breakthrough between the two rivals may come soon. ""My sense is they are moving forward quickly,"" he said at an earlier press conference with Gul. ""I don't want to pre-empt any arrangements that could be made in the near future.""

"(CNN) -- ""If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promise of life, as if he related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the 'creative temperament' -- it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No -- Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men."" â€• F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby . Seriously, now ... how can any movie director achieve a stretch of moving images that can even sneak up on the ineffable beauty, the limpid grace, the near-magical intersection of metaphor and tone found in such prose? You'd be just as well off trying to ""adapt"" one of Keats' odes or Wordsworth's pastorals into a filmed version. ""Rosetta Stone: The Movie,"" anyone? Again, seriously, why can't filmmakers let ""The Great Gatsby"" be? Mostly because the rest of us can't. Though F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 masterwork was regarded as something of a failure in his brief, sad lifetime, it has since the 1940s steadily risen in the kind of popularity broad enough to take in generations, cultural backgrounds and whole nations. There have been five attempts to make a movie version of Fitzgerald's Jazz Age tale about a wealthy young man with a mysterious, vaguely sinister past and how, having reinvented himself, sets about trying to reinvent his romantic destiny. Australian Baz Luhrmann's turn at bat with this Great American Novel opened Friday with Leonardo DiCaprio playing the eponymous Jay Gatsby, Tobey Maguire as his circumspect neighbor Nick Carraway and Carey Mulligan as Nick's moneyed cousin Daisy Buchannan, the glistening, potential fulfillment of Gatsby's dearest (or, maybe direst) wishes. Reviews, saying the least, have been mixed, with some, like the Miami Herald's Connie Ogle declaring it a ""failure"" and the Philadelphia Inquirer Steven Rea describing it as ""audaciously miscalculated"" while others, notably the New York Times' A.O. Scott and New York magazine's customarily finicky David Edelstein, admit being entertained by what Scott characterizes as a ""splashy, trashy opera."" News: 'Unfilmable' novels? No such thing, says Hollywood . Such impressions seem to have been anticipated because of Luhrmann's reputation for mounting such gaudily apportioned accounts of thwarted love as 1996's ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"" (which also starred DiCaprio) and 2001's ""Moulin Rouge!"" Even those who praise the movie do so acknowledging its lavish set pieces (Oh, those parties!), its hyped-up theatricality and its often-anachronistic musical background (Oh, that hip-hop!). But as Edelstein writes, ""For all its computer-generated whoosh and overbroad acting, (the movie) is unmistakably F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby.' That is no small deal."" What Edelstein means (and I agree) is that Luhrmann's ""Gatsby,"" in ramping up the opulence of the era and the intensity of the romance, comes closer than any previous movie adaptation so far in touching the emotional spirit of Fitzgerald's novel. But the story's visceral appeal presents a problem for those who contend that the novel's poetic language and resonant imagery are merely cloaking devices for what amounts to a thin, lurid storyline that would barely pass muster in a bottom-feeding pulp magazine. In a meticulous deflation of the book's repute found on the same New York magazine website as Edelstein's review, writer Kathryn Schulz's disdain even spreads to the characters, none of whom she regards ""as likeable. None of whom are even dislikeable, though nearly all of them are despicable."" Look: Gatsby's Gold Coast: 8 grand estates . One could argue that the shallowness of Fitzgerald's glamorous strivers is precisely the novel's point. The ""abortive sorrows and short-winded elations"" to which Fitzgerald refers in the opening quote account to most, if not all, of America's transient aspirations, practically from the country's inception. Moreover, theirs is the kind of shallowness upon which we can repeatedly project not just our own apprehensions of desire but those of everyone we know and will come to know throughout our lives. And so what if the novel's skeleton is little more than pulp? What would have happened if the storyline were any more elaborately designed? Would it have become even more lachrymose? Or more farcical? Something would have been thrown off-balance. With each rereading, one finds that Fitzgerald made all the right choices and arranged them all with as much precision as he was able to summon. This also applies to the language -- which has left many so dumbstruck with wonder and admiration that it threatens to paralyze even one's effort to express admiration for it. Recall 1974's more immaculately fashioned movie version of ""Gatsby,"" which was directed by ace literary adaptor Jack Clayton (""The Innocents""), boasted a screenplay by ""The Godfather's"" Francis Ford Coppola and starred Robert Redford as Gatsby, Mia Farrow as Daisy and Sam Waterston as Nick. That film was enormously faithful to Fitzgerald's novel -- and not much else. Luhrmann's, for the record, is just as faithful. But Clayton's film of ""Gatsby"" doesn't so much render the book so much as one's reverential reading of it. Luhrmann's response is more rapturous and unruly -- and, perhaps, this brings it closest of all to the spirit of the emotionally clumsy but romantic dreamer who created this enduring story in the first place. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gene Seymour.","Gene Seymour: How can any director translate beauty of Fitzgerald prose in ""Gatsby?""

"(CNN) -- When our father, Michael Grant Cahill, was murdered in the Fort Hood, Texas, shooting on November 5, 2009, we were barraged with the question, ""What can we do?"" People wanted to help, get milk, make us casserole and assist relatives with travel. Support was everywhere. That support remains. In the wake of shootings in Newtown, Aurora, Tucson, Oak Creek, and too many more places, people are asking again, ""What can we do?"" First, we must stop asking ""why?"" and start asking ""why not?"" In other words, what are we doing to prevent these tragic shootings? Opinion: Patterns and warning signs . These events are caused by a perfect storm of issues. These include the proliferation of assault rifles and clips of 30 to 100 rounds, access to mental health support or lack of it, and, most important, falling short in our efforts of prevention. It is a sinking ship, and we must start filling the holes. Holes made by guns that shoot 45 rounds in 1 minute, like the semi-automatic rifle used in Newtown. Holes inspired by the glorification of the shooters in previous shootings. Their life-size faces on the cover of Time magazine, bought by you, and dominating the Internet sites you browse, while the fallen are left in the photo albums of their families. Holes made by the lack of help and understanding in our country's mental health. Holes made by the fact that the Newtown children are not the only children we have lost to mass shootings. They are the unfortunate 20 who made us realize the water is up to our throats. The water is rising. What hole can you fill? Can you think about prevention rather than reaction by supporting programs in our schools that encourage our children to look out for one another? Can you be honest about what it would take to defend yourself against an assault rifle? Can you pay attention to important legislation and contact your congressman and senators to show support or share your thoughts? Can you stop saying, ""Glad it wasn't me"" and start saying ""What if it was me?"" We cannot continue accepting that ""these things happen"" and ""you will never stop evil."" Those statements ensure that more innocents will die. Our father charged a gun outfitted with 30-round extended clips and was shot six times. Dad never let evil get the last word. He never looked at a problem and thought it was hopeless. We must do the same, and we must be honest: sacrificing our pride and admitting that we, as a nation, have a problem. We need training for our teachers and police officers. Training that doesn't just focus on how to react to shootings but knows the community and makes relationships that lead to safer communities. Opinion: Freedom Group, a gunmaker ripe for an ethical takeover . Programs such as Rachel's Challenge started after the Columbine shooting by the parents of the first student killed, Rachel Joy Scott. The Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, started after the Oklahoma City Bombing, which trains police officers not just to recognize danger but how to create communities that are more aware. ""Random actor"" trainings, by Dan Korem, teaching educators how to identify possible mass shooters, focus on at-risk kids and help those students. Gun sales are rising, but is the support for the families affected by some of those guns and commitment to prevention rising with it? Here is the question we are haunted by: ""What is wrong with us that it takes 20 children dying in one shooting to make us change?"" And some of us still won't. We have to address the answers, and we have to have the conversation. Let's start fixing the problem instead of treating the symptoms. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Cahill and Vanacker: Our father was murdered in the Fort Hood shooting in 2009 .

"(CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. ""There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,"" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. ""In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives."" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. ""It never ends,"" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. ""Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives."" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has ""more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,"" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings. Californians have a stake in their health and the environment, because they want to enjoy the state's natural landscape, said several people interviewed for the article. ""What brings many people to California is the climate and the culture,"" said Matt Rodriquez, California's Secretary for Environmental Protection. ""That means people who do come here have an interest in preserving ... a beautiful environment, clean air and clean water."" The willingness to innovate in health laws is part of the California's culture, said Marice Ashe, founder and executive director of Public Health Law & Policy in Oakland, California. ""You see that in technology innovation in Silicon Valley, there's a lot of sharing of ideas and resources that lead to major breakthroughs."" A similar vibe exists in public health because there is a high concentration of medical, public health and law schools and organizations exchanging ideas, she said. Since California started allowing ballot initiatives in 1911, its voters have swept in many several pioneering health laws. In 1986, the state's voters passed a ballot initiative requiring information on products if they contain chemicals known to cause cancer, birth defects or reproductive harm. Products like electrical cords and Tiffany-style lamps carry statements: ""WARNING: This product contains lead, a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling."" One of California's biggest examples of its influence on public health law is tobacco regulation. In 1988, voters approved a proposition to become the first state to tax cigarettes to fund a tobacco control program. Ten years later, California banned smoking in public places such as trains, planes, buses, workplaces and restaurants. Now, about half of the states have similar policies about smoking in public places. California became a guide for developing anti-smoking policies, said Lawrence Green, who formerly served as the acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Office on Smoking and Health. The state also has a long history of limiting air pollution. California was the first state to ban a chemical used in laundromats called perchloroethylene, prohibit leaded gasoline, require smog checks and reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. The state's air resource board passed another rule in January requiring reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and putting more zero-emission vehicles on the road. California, home to more than 37 million people and the world's ninth-largest economy, has major clout. ""It's a large and powerful state, it can challenge national industries and has done so,"" said Green, professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine. In certain cases, California laws have gone too far, according to the courts. Last year, the Supreme Court struck down a California law that would have banned selling violent video games to children. The state asserted that it had a legal obligation to protect children from graphic interactive images, but the court ruled the law violated the First Amendment. ""As far as red states and blue states go, it's probably the largest blue state with more progressive attitudes towards issues around public health,"" Green said. ""And some cities, San Francisco and Los Angeles, have been passing some of the laws at municipal level, that lays the ground for state legislation."" California's cities often grab headlines with health-oriented initiatives. The City of Los Angeles recently passed a law requiring all adult film workers to use condoms to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Pornography filmmakers have responded by threatening to move elsewhere. Santa Clara County, located in northern California, became the first to ban fast- food restaurants from handing out give free trinkets with their kid's meals in 2010. San Francisco quickly passed a similar law and New York City's leaders have also indicated interest. But California does not rank as one of the healthiest states, according to America's Health Rankings. It ranks in the middle, at 24, when the health of its residents is compared with other states. California came in as the worst for air pollution and near the top in cancer deaths (sixth), infant mortality (fifth) and occupational fatalities (fourth). Because California houses more than 10% of the U.S. population, it may not be fair to compare a state with such a huge, diverse population with one that's more homogenous and smaller, like Vermont, which ranks as the healthiest state. ""The amount of cultural and income diversity in the state, the huge size of low-income population puts health equity to test here,"" said Ashe, a lawyer who specializes in public health issues. ""We are not the healthiest state despite innovations; we have challenges that we embrace and try to offer solutions."" Pearce, author of ""Crazifornia: Tales from the Tarnished State"" said all the regulations have hurt California's economy. The state has lost manufacturing jobs and companies because of too much regulation, he said. For years, California has faced budget shortfalls, and its governor, Jerry Brown, is now calling for tax increases in sales and high-end income. ""It's a love-hate,"" Pearce said about his views of California. ""There's so much to the government, it drives me a little crazy."" Ashe said people who blame regulations for economic woes don't see the bigger picture. ""People love to beat up on the nanny state and point a finger at regulation,"" said Ashe. For example, she said that not regulating air quality means more people would have health problems such as heart disease and asthma. ""If we don't do something, we are costing the state untold billions of dollars,"" she said. ""It'd be worse without protection.""","California led several public health efforts in tobacco control, air quality .
Residents tend to be health-conscious because of culture, environment .
Critics say the state over-regulates, stifling freedom and economy .

"(CNN) -- Inside Larry Smarr's refrigerator this week was a stool sample that he planned to ship to a laboratory, which will send back a report of information about what's going on inside Smarr. This monthly test is not part of his doctor's orders, nor is the plethora of mobile technologies that Smarr uses to track what's going on inside his body. But Smarr believes everyone should take charge of monitoring their own health, given how little time people tend to spend actually talking to their doctors. Smarr may be an extreme example, but many people are turning to available technologies to gain knowledge about their bodies that they can use to optimize their health, beyond what information annual doctor's visits might bring. ""I am trying to respect my doctor by doing my part of the homework,"" said Smarr, 63, of La Jolla, California. Smarr is the director of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, a research center at the University of California's San Diego and Irvine campuses. Devotion to self-tracking has a name -- ""Quantified Self"" -- which is a website established by Wired co-founder Kevin Kelly and Gary Wolf, Wired contributing editor. Wolf's own website, Aether, says more than 12,000 people worldwide are members of Quantified Self Meetups. As of Thursday, there were 873 people registered for the Quantified Self message boards, where people discuss the latest apps and research. The website has a list of hundreds of apps and tools available for tracking different aspects of your life, from mood to diet to sleep. The movement hosted the conference Quantified Self 2012 last weekend, with Smarr as a guest speaker. In Smarr's view, it's absurd that we know the ins and outs of our cars, and invest in maintaining them, in ways that we don't with our bodies. Imagine if you put water into your gas tank because you didn't read the manual, he said -- that's what some people are doing with their bodies. ""If there are key variables that I want that the insurance won't pay for, I will pay for it,"" he said. ""If your car needs some preventive maintenance, you pay for it."" Tracking with your phone and other gadgets . Apps and small devices are getting ever more sophisticated in helping to track vital signs. Smarr, for instance, wears a FitBit device every day to measure his caloric intake and how many steps he takes. At night, he wears a Zeo, which sends a graph of the phases of his sleep cycle to his smartphone. An app called Instant Heart Rate uses his phone's camera flash to measure pulse rate, and a second program called Stress Check measures the interval between heartbeats; irregularity means you are stressed, constant means calm. A diet and fitness tracking app called SparkPeople has helped Michelle Jackson, 39, lose 102 pounds since March 2011. She's not as serious about tracking all aspects of her body as Smarr, but admits that the few times when the app malfunctions because of an update, ""I feel really almost debilitated,"" she said. ""I'm very dependent on it."" Jackson uses the app to schedule all meals she plans to eat for the next week, starting with Sunday, but can make adjustments if plans change. The app suggests the calories, fat, protein and carbs to eat daily, and also helps her track the number of calories she burns as she records fitness activities. Other apps exist to track how you feel. The mood app MoodScope uses an online card game to assess your happiness levels, and also offers tracking and comment features so you can see what might be behind your ups and downs over time. There's a social component, too. The next hot area will be apps for mental and spiritual well-being, said Tim Chang, managing director of Mayfield Fund and an early venture capital investor in health tracking apps. Up-and-coming programs will include personalized training in optimizing things like stress and meditation. In the future, phones may be able to get even deeper inside your head. There's a portable brain scanning system developed at Denmark Technical University that combines a low-cost EEG headset and a smartphone or tablet. Imagine a toilet with a built-in urine scanner for health; that's also in development, Chang said. Meanwhile, there are tons of apps to experiment with: Quantified Self enthusiast Rachelle DiGregorio created a handy map of apps to help you navigate through various tools available for different purposes. The body as a science experiment . Once Smarr got interested in tracking things like caloric intake, weight and exercise, he took it a step further, ordering his own blood tests -- many of which insurance companies do not cover -- four to eight times a year to look for markers of inflammation. His out-of-pocket expenses for this amount to more than $5,000 per year. He started tracking his own levels of C-reactive protein, which is correlated with inflammation. In 2008, after plotting levels of this protein for two years, he saw a dramatic increase in less than a year. That indicated to him that there was a problem in his body that needed to be dealt with. Since Smarr felt fine physically, his doctors were not concerned about the results of tests he'd undergone on his own, telling him to come back when he had symptoms. Those symptoms started within a few weeks: ""I experienced a sudden, severe pain in my left abdomen, perhaps the worse persistent pain I have ever known,"" Smarr wrote in an article in Strategic News. Doctors diagnosed acute diverticulitis and prescribed antibiotics. Smarr was not satisfied. Additional blood tests revealed his C-reactive protein levels were still above the normal range; given his strict diet and exercise regimen, this was mysterious. Being a scientist, he decided to seek out different data: from a stool sample. Lactoferrin is an antibacterial chemical in the white blood cells that emits something equivalent to tear gas when in attacking mode. Smarr's lab results showed that his levels of lactoferrin were 124 times the upper limit. He read in medical studies that this chemical has been shown to differentiate between irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease. Based on the results of Smarr's previous colonoscopy, his doctor said he couldn't possibly have Crohn's disease. ""The doctor said, 'Why are you doing this? You should not be doing this. If you need tests I'll tell you,'"" Smarr remembered. Instead, Smarr found a different doctor: Dr. William Sandborn, a specialist in gastrointestinal disorders. Sandborn recalls receiving an e-mail from Smarr saying ""he'd had persistently elevated biomarkers in blood and stool that were unexplained."" Sandborn took Smarr on as a patient and ordered an MRI and another colonoscopy. Putting all the data together, Sandborn determined Smarr was likely to have early Crohn's disease. They decided not to treat until Smarr became symptomatic; when he did start having problems, doctor and patient were able to come up with a customized treatment, Sandborn said. Smarr didn't stop there. He took data from the MRI and used software to create a three-dimensional simulation so that, video-game style, he can zoom in and out of the colon and look at it in detail. It's unclear whether Sandborn would have made this diagnosis had Smarr never undergone all those independent tests and drawn up corresponding charts, Sandborn said. But Sandborn considers Smarr a scientist conducting an experiment on himself, and the pilot study is ongoing. ""All innovation has to start somewhere,"" Sandborn said. ""This guy is an innovator."" This all goes beyond what most people would even think to do, but Smarr said his point is to ""be pointing the way to what people can do over the next five and 10 years as these things come down."" His experiment isn't over. Smarr had his microbiome sequenced at the J. Craig Venter Institute -- that's all of the microbes that live inside him -- to see what insights can be gleaned from the addition of that data to the library of himself. When is it too much information? Smarr is on the edge of a noticeable movement of people becoming more interested in their health, Sandborn said. On a health policy level, what Smarr is doing is not ready for prime time, he said. It's not sufficiently tested to recommend that everyone seek their own biomarker analyses without having a doctor deem it medically necessary, and the cost-benefit ratio isn't known. Pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Shu said she agrees with that. She's all for using phones and related devices to track health -- she uses FitBit and the MapMyRun app herself. She thinks it's a great idea to share this information with doctors, and encourages her young patients to increase their steps by 10% each week until they hit a certain goal. Ordering your own medical tests online, beyond what doctors would otherwise recommend, opens up a lot of potential problems, Shu said: over-testing, over-diagnosis, over-utilization of resources and false positives, meaning the results may suggest you have a disease that you don't. In Shu's opinion, extreme tracking and testing is not a good idea, ""but it can be difficult for people to know where to draw the line,"" she said in an e-mail. Still, all science begins with a novel idea that is tested on a small scale, which is what Smarr is doing, Sandborn said. Also, to some extent, Smarr is making discoveries. His efforts have led to the diagnosis of a chronic, incurable disease in his body, but Smarr is still optimistic. ""I feel much more like I'm in control because I'm measuring it, I'm monitoring it, I'm understanding my bacteria -- how it's been screwed up by antibiotics and other things,"" he said. ""I'm quite hopeful that over the next five, 10, 20 years, we're going to see cures for a lot of things that we currently think of as incurable.""","Many mobile apps are available to track eating, fitness, mood .

"(CNN) -- Can lightning strike twice for filmmakers hoping to cash in on the popularity of Stephenie Meyer's teen fiction? The ""Twilight"" movies didn't wow critics, but they struck a chord with their target audience. I'm afraid ""The Host"" will only duplicate the first half of that experience. The story borrows from Jack Finney's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" which has been filmed several times -- by Don Siegel in 1956, Philip Kaufman in 1978 and Abel Ferrara in 1993, and more recently, but less successfully, by the Wachowskis as ""The Invasion"" in 2007. The idea that other people are alien automatons just doesn't go away. Meyer's 2008 novel ""The Host"" departs from Finney's yarn by skipping forward a few years. The invasion is over, the body snatchers have won; only a handful of humans have escaped detection, subsisting off the map, scavenging for survival. This is also the first version willing to meet the aliens halfway: They may not be as sexy as vampires in Meyer's imagination, but they're about as benevolent as any extraterrestrial occupying power could be. In fact, they're ""Souls,"" a higher form of consciousness who never lie, kill, or steal. Which makes you wonder how they annexed the Earth in the first place? Max Irons, Jake Abel talk 'The Host' Andrew Niccol's heavy-handed adaptation gives rise to that question and several others: like why the Souls cannot track down the holdouts with their superior otherworldly technology -- or failing that, figure out that anyone wearing sunglasses probably merits cross examination (after they've been possessed by the Souls, human eyes turn a peculiarly virulent light blue). Saoirse Ronan is Melanie, another of Meyer's divided ""tweenagers,"" who falls into the hands of the Souls and is possessed by an alien named Wanderer (""Wanda"" for short). Melanie is a holdout, though. She refuses to vacate her consciousness and carries on an internal debate with Wanda for most of the story. Ronan is one of our most promising young actresses, but listening to her wrestle for command of her own brain made me yearn for Steve Martin's antic duels with Lily Tomlin in ""All of Me."" Martin's bisexual split personality spilled out into the way he held himself, the way he walked, and ate, and urinated. Ronan is more like a ventriloquist's wooden dummy, understandably unhappy but also unbending no matter who is inside her head. Melanie gains the upper hand long enough to escape the Souls' surveillance and get away to a human sanctuary, a refuge deep inside a cavernous desert butte. (This network of caves is the most eye-catching thing in the movie.) Here she must convince her former friends and family that Wanda means them no harm -- one of several themes that will echo with ""Twilight"" fans. Like Bella Swan, Melanie is courted by two rivals: one who was in love with her before her conversion, and another who feels strangely attracted to Wanda. ""You wouldn't love me if you saw what I really looked like,"" she warns him -- though like horny young men anywhere, he's not unduly concerned in such philosophical imponderables. As for Wanda, she develops an admiration for the grit and passion embodied by these mortals, and secretly wonders whether a little interstellar intercourse would be such a bad thing? This is pretty silly stuff, ""Twi""-lite if you will, but played with maximum solemnity, no discernible humor and minimal excitement. At least it's a modest improvement on Niccol's last foray into sci-fi allegory, the glum and pretentious ""In Time,"" and ""Simone"" before that, but by now it's clear his rudimentary directing skills don't do his screenplays many favors. To be fair, I enjoyed the dazzling hand-cranked solar panels that allow William Hurt's green-fingered old coot Jeb to farm wheat deep inside a desert crater, not to mention the hare-brained audacity of casting Hurt as a coot named Jeb. And who can resist the unusually crowded romantic triangle -- with four aching hearts but only three bodies to play for? Too bad Niccol fails to flesh out the male suitors (Max Irons and Jake Abel -- both blandly anonymous), and he doesn't make much of the story's most intriguing character -- Diane Kruger's obsessive alien cop, The Seeker -- either. That leaves Ronan talking to herself as the film's dramatic linchpin, a prospect unlikely to get audiences worked up one way or the other.","""The Host"" is the latest film adaptation of Stephanie Meyer novel .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The high-end specialty coffee industry isn't immune to the effects of a recession, but many companies are still doing well. Growers, roasters and equipment manufacturers were represented at the coffee expo in Atlanta. Portland Roasting had a slow holiday season, but business is picking up, said owner Mark Stell. ""February was a great month for us,"" he said. Stell traveled from Oregon to Atlanta, Georgia, for the Specialty Coffee Association of America expo, where the show floor was filled with nearly 800 booths featuring everything from exotic coffee beans to the latest Italian espresso machines. Stell's company sells about a million pounds of coffee a year. He said sales to offices and hotels are down but are being replaced by orders from grocers and universities. ""People don't leave coffee,"" he said. ""They just get it differently."" Tony Riffel owns Octane Coffee in Atlanta and was watching the 10th annual World Barista Championship, held in conjunction with the expo at the Georgia World Congress Center. Pushcart owner Gwilym Davies of London, England, won the 2009 barista crown.  Watch baristas battle for the world title » . Riffel said business at his coffee shop was flat last summer, but sales are up 10 percent for the first quarter of 2009. ""The first part of this year has been our best ever,"" he said. ""People are being careful with what they're spending money on, but they're spending it on quality products."" Business is good enough that Riffel plans to open a second location this year. ""Now is a really good time to do that,"" he said. ""Developers and landlords are more flexible and negotiable,"" even though banks are ""pickier than normal."" Joseph Taguman also knows about picky banks. The general manager of the Zambia Growers Association said the lack of financing is holding back the association's 80 farmers. Taguman said the farmers could grow more than their current rate of about 300 metric tons per year, but trees take time to grow and long-term financing is hard to come by in Zambia. A couple of aisles over from Taguman's booth, Shawn Contreras sees a similar problem. Contreras is the sales director for Diedrich Manufacturing, which has been selling roasting equipment for nearly 30 years. He said wholesale roasters are continuing to grow, but smaller operations are having ""an extraordinarily difficult time"" getting funding. Consultant Andrew Hetzel acknowledges that credit is a hindering factor for companies, but he is optimistic about the specialty coffee industry. ""The U.S. market is continuing at a steady pace,"" he said. But it's a slower pace than the past few years. ""Coffee is something that has been with humanity for 1,500 years,"" Hetzel said.

"(CNN) -- Mexican smugglers have used tunnels, cars, boats and even the human body in attempts to sneak drugs past U.S. agents in an endless cat-and-mouse game on the U.S.-Mexico border. Now smugglers have devised a new invention to ferry their contraband over the nearly militarized border: cannons. An air-powered cannon fires bags of illegal drugs into the air from Mexico and plops them on U.S. soil, for nighttime retrieval by conspirators, U.S. authorities said Thursday. Mexican authorities recently confiscated one such cannon in the bed of a pickup truck in Mexicali, police there said. Mexicali shares the international boundary with Calexico, California. The confiscation of the cannon -- which Mexican authorities publicized in a photograph -- is the first that U.S. border and customs agents are aware of, a U.S. official said. ""Well, I've been in (law enforcement) for over 20 years, and it seems like within the last five to 10 years they have gotten really, really creative in how they bring their drugs across,"" said Andy Adame, special operations supervisor for the Joint Field Command Arizona of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Border Patrol officers to be furloughed . Cannons apparently are smugglers' newest creation, said Adame, who's based in Tucson. ""This is the first one that I've seen,"" he said Thursday of the one seized by police in Mexicali. ""That was actually a pretty good one. ""They are definitely out of the ordinary,"" Adame said. In another incident, U.S. authorities found 33 cans of marijuana embedded in Arizona farmland last December, as if they dropped out of the sky, Adame said. In fact, U.S. authorities believe a pneumatic cannon fired each canister 500 feet over the Colorado River from Mexico. American agents notified Mexican authorities to search their side of the border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement last December. Only a carbon dioxide tank was found, the U.S. agency said. The 33 cans contained a total of 85 pounds of marijuana, valued at $42,500, U.S. authorities said. Aussie police make big meth haul . ""The smugglers were trying to pick these up before daylight, but there was probably an agent in the area,"" Adame said, explaining why the smugglers on the U.S. side never collected the canisters that pockmarked the tilled land. Last week, police in Mexicali found a cannon made from a large tube in the back of an abandoned Dodge Ram pickup truck, said spokesman Edgar Lopez. The device operated with a compressor connected to the truck, Mexican authorities said. No arrests have been made. Last year, Mexican authorities seized a catapult that was used to launch bundled drugs, Lopez said. In connection with that incident, U.S. authorities seized marijuana near Naco, Arizona, that was apparently launched over the border fence, Adame said.

"(CNN) -- Featuring risque-looking dresses that dispense cocktails and frocks that billow smoke, the clothes on show at the ""Technosensual"" exhibition could be mistaken for an auction of Lady Gaga's more bizarre outfits. But it's hoped that the designs on display at Quartier21 in the MuseumsQuartier, Vienna, Austria, will pique the interest of both fashionistas and tech heads. The Bubelle dress, designed by Lucy McRae for the Dutch electronics firm Philips, reveals the wearer's emotional state using biometric sensors that trigger different light and color displays.

"(CNN) -- With President Obama's re-election, many liberals believe they possess the building blocks of the winning political coalition of the future: college students, single women, gays, secularists, Hispanics, African-Americans and Asian-Americans. Liberals see here not a splintered electorate but key constituencies united by a common agenda of economic and social justice. In previous columns, I have conceded the strength of the Democrats in these quarters. Fifty, 25, perhaps even 10 years ago, this brand of liberalism probably would have failed. But today, the country, the demographics and the culture are different. Americans are less white, less religious and less likely to get married and have families. Liberalism has adapted accordingly. For the college student struggling with student loan debt, the single mother who can barely afford to provide for her children, the minority family in the inner city struggling to find work, liberalism offers immediate relief: subsidized student loans, national health care and entitlements for the elderly and the poor. Rather than waiting on free markets to correct themselves and start creating wealth again, liberalism's cure is immediate, and so are the political payoffs. This explains partly why many voters feel liberals care about them more than conservatives. For the ideologically driven -- the pro-choice, pro-gay-marriage voters and Sandra Flukes of the world (she was the Georgetown student at the center of a birth control debate this year) -- liberalism offers a slightly different relief: the rejection of the central role of mediating institutions -- like churches, families and community organizations -- in imposing moral standards to govern or regulate behavior within the state. Politics: The new America -- What the election teaches us about ourselves . Churches and families can exist, says liberalism, so long as they exercise ""soft"" religion and don't force their views on the public. When they do, like in the case of the Catholic Church and contraception, it's necessary, says liberalism, for the state to step in and impart justice. This explains Obamacare's contraception mandate and why much was made over the ""war on women."" Liberalism has effectively persuaded its many factions that it is uniquely qualified to meet their needs and desires, while conservatism has not. By its nature, liberalism molds to fit these times better than conservatism; conservatism is by its nature more abstract than practical, more focused on long-term considerations than short term. Does this mean that conservatism is past its time and that liberalism is the mandate of the future? No, it doesn't. Liberalism's continued success depends on many factors, but two in particular. First, it must paint the political alternative, conservatism, as the faction of social injustice, as anti-immigrant, anti-entitlement, anti-regulation and so on. The Obama campaign did that effectively in this election without an equally effective conservative response. One presumes that conservatives will be ready in 2016. Second, and more important, effective state intervention of the sort liberals propose depends almost entirely on a state that is strong economically and socially. It is here that liberalism falls short in the long term. The various liberal constituencies are in fact atomized groups of individuals who are relying on government, rather than creating the economic growth or fostering the social and civic health necessary to sustain the ideal liberal state. Whereas liberals see entitlements as the immediate response to economic injustice, many fail to realize that they alone cannot rebuild a middle class. In fact, they can have the opposite effect in the long term and insulate their recipients from upward mobility. With $16 trillion in national debt, an aging population and an already-overburdened entitlement system, the ideal liberal social welfare state can only sustain itself for so long before it collapses under its own weight. It is a lifeline attached to a slowly sinking ship. Politics: The new American electorate arrives . Whereas liberals celebrate subsidized birth control and the unmooring of what they see as narrow-minded religious moral standards, they fail to realize the alternative that is right in front of them: out-of-wedlock birth rates that are at all-time highs and a destructive breakdown in the family unit. Absent strong, active, character-forming institutions, like families, schools, and churches, single mothers and low-income households in many cases have no where else to turn but to the government. The problem is that liberals often confuse such allegiance with successful governing. The liberal coalition of the future looks more like Greece, an advanced secular, social welfare state, than the idealized liberal glory days of FDR. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Bennett.","William Bennett: Since Obama won, liberals think winning coalition is diverse new groups .
He says it include gays, blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans, students, single women .

"(CNN) -- Dave Taylor, a Civil War antiques dealer in Sylvania, Ohio, was excited about the possibility of buying a ""top-notch,"" genuine .36-caliber Spiller & Burr revolver that had belonged to a Confederate officer from North Carolina. A Tennessee woman who inherited the revolver from her late father sent him photos and, eventually, they agreed to a price, he said. ""The purchase price we discussed was significant ... about double the annual salary I earned my first year out of college in 1979,"" Taylor told CNN Tuesday in an e-mail. ""But the gun appeared to be in stellar condition, and I was anxious to buy it."" A day before driving down to Knoxville to finish the deal in late November, Taylor said he thumbed through an old reference book that indicated a photo of the sidearm was courtesy of the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia. Uh-oh. Taylor contacted Catherine Wright, collections manager at the museum, and by comparing photos and the piece's serial number, they determined the revolver was a match with one stolen from the museum in 1975. Now, thanks to the intrepid research and the Tennessee woman's interest in doing the right thing, the gun should be back in the museum by February 1, the museum said Tuesday. The revolver belonged to George Washington Rains, known with older sibling, Gabriel, as one of the ""Bomb Brothers"" for creating all manner of gunpowder-infused weapons for the Confederacy during the Civil War . Rains, who early in his career did a stint on the faculty of the U.S. Military Academy, survived the war and lived into his 80s, dying in 1898. The North Carolina officer's military trappings, including the prized revolver, were housed in the Museum of the Confederacy. In 1975, the revolver, worth an estimated $50,000 today, was stolen. According to the FBI office in Knoxville, Krissy Evans had a Civil War revolver that was in her late father's belongings and she decided to seek an appraisal. After ""substantial research"" and learning the weapon's history, Evans immediately decided to return the artifact to the museum, the FBI said in a news release. The six-round revolver was not Confederate standard issue. Instead, individuals would purchase such a sidearm. This particular Spiller & Burr gun was one of about 1,450 made, probably in Macon, Georgia, said Wright, who contacted the FBI. ""It was not terribly common,"" she told CNN. Taylor said he considered the piece a ""topnotch"" version of that revolver. Wright, who has kept a short list of items stolen from the museum, said she got a call December 1 from Taylor, who forwarded photos for the comparison. ""There was a nick on the wooden handle that was exactly in the same place"" as museum photos of the revolver, according to Wright. Taylor ""was very instrumental"" in the return of the gun, she said. The museum does not know who stole the item, although it doesn't believe it was an inside job, Wright said. Items were being transferred in 1975 from the original museum building to a new one when the revolver disappeared. ""It was more of a rickety old case"" the pilferer managed to open, she said. Guards apparently were very trusting of people moving the artifacts, she said. CNN left messages Tuesday for Evans, who Taylor believes had no idea the item was stolen. ""Ms. Evans is to be commended for her ethical integrity,"" Knoxville FBI Special Agent in Charge Richard L. Lambert said in the release. ""By returning this artifact to the museum, Ms. Evans has ensured that it will be preserved and treasured for generations to come."" Jason Pack, a special agent with the FBI in Washington, said there was no formal investigation. ""We are just a facilitator"" in the revolver being returned to the museum. For his part, Taylor is pleased he didn't spend a ""small fortune"" on the gun, only to lose it. ""There's no glory in having a piece of history that was stolen,"" he said.","Research determines Civil War gun a woman had inherited had been stolen from a museum .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- To people around the world who have seen the video, Esmin Green is a symbol of a health-care system that seems to have failed horribly. Fellow churchmembers say they served as a family for Esmin Green, shown in 2007, after she left Jamaica. Green, 49, is shown rolling off a waiting room chair at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, on June 19. She lands face-down on the floor, convulsing. Surveillance video captures her lying on the floor for more than an hour as several hospital workers see her and appear to ignore her. She died there. But to fellow members of her church, she was known as ""Sister Green."" Together, they served as a family for her in the decade after she left Jamaica for New York. Green left six children in Jamaica -- the youngest now 14. She had been sending money home.  Watch 'Sister Green' in church » . Her oldest daughter, 31-year-old Tecia Harrison, told CNN that she cannot bear to think of her mother's last moments. ""I haven't seen it, and I don't think I have the heart or mind to watch it because that's my mother there,"" Harrison said. ""That's the woman who gave birth to me 31 years ago. I cannot watch that."" Green was involuntarily admitted to the hospital's psychiatric emergency department June 18 for ""agitation and psychosis."" Friend Peter Pilgrim says he saw Green a few days before her death. He says she was struggling with losing her job at a day care center and had been forced to move out of her apartment. ""Esmin Green is a beautiful person,"" he said. ""She has a good heart. She loved people, and she loved children."" Green's pastor says she had been hospitalized with emotional problems once before and recently appeared to be in distress again. So the pastor called 911, a decision that haunts her. Upon her admission, Green waited nearly 24 hours for treatment, said the New York Civil Liberties Union, which released the surveillance video of the incident Tuesday. Her collapse came at 5:32 a.m. June 19, the NYCLU said, and she stopped moving at 6:07 a.m. During that time, according to the organization, workers at the hospital ignored her. At 6:35 a.m., the tape shows a hospital employee approaching and nudging Green with her foot, the group said. Help was summoned three minutes later.  Watch the surveillance video » . In addition, the organization said, hospital staff falsified Green's records to cover up the time she had lain there without assistance. ""Contrary to what was recorded from four different angles by the hospital's video cameras, the patient's medical records say that at 6 a.m., she got up and went to the bathroom, and at 6:20 a.m. she was 'sitting quietly in waiting room' -- more than 10 minutes since she last moved and 48 minutes after she fell to the floor."" The medical examiner's office says it is still trying to determine what caused Green's death. Her medical records will be the focus of an investigation. Hospital documents say she was ""awake and sitting quietly"" at the very moment she was actually struggling on the floor. The New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which oversees the hospital, released a statement Tuesday saying it was ""shocked and distressed by this situation. It is clear that some of our employees failed to act based on our compassionate standards of care."" James Saunders, a spokesman for the corporation, said seven employees have been fired or suspended: the chief of psychiatry, chief of security, a doctor, two nurses and two security guards. A Health and Hospitals Corporation spokeswoman said it was aware of the discrepancies in Green's record when it began the preliminary investigation June 20. The corporation pledged to put ""additional and significant"" reforms in place in the wake of the death. A federal investigation is also under way, looking into abuse allegations at Kings County that were detailed in a lawsuit in 2007. In May 2007, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the Mental Hygiene Legal Service sued Kings County in federal court, alleging that conditions at the facility are filthy. Patients are often forced to sleep in plastic chairs or on floors covered in urine, feces and blood while waiting for beds, the groups allege, and often go without basic hygiene such as showers, clean linens and clean clothes. The lawsuit claims that patients who complain face physical abuse and are injected with drugs to keep them docile. The hospital, the suit alleges, lacks ""the minimal requirements of basic cleanliness, space, privacy, and personal hygiene that are constitutionally guaranteed even to convicted felons."" Among the reforms agreed to in court Tuesday by the hospital are additional staffing; checking of patients every 15 minutes; and limiting to 25 the number of patients in the psychiatric emergency ward, officials said. In addition, the hospital said it is expanding crisis-prevention training for staff; expanding space to prevent overcrowding; and reducing patients' wait time for release, treatment or placement in an inpatient bed.","Daughter, ""I don't think I have the heart or mind to watch"" the video .

"(CNN) -- Despite the election cycle rhetoric surrounding immigration, which would make it seem like the rest of the world is swarming across U.S. borders like ants to a picnic, gobbling up our resources, the reality is quite different. There are a number of myths that we must dispel in order to forge a sound policy, or else we risk our own potential downfall in the long run. The first myth is that America continues to be a nation of immigrants. The second is that everyone who is thinking of emigrating wants to come to the U.S. Next is the idea that we beat the competition in attracting the best and brightest immigrants. Lastly is the belief that immigrants end up as a burden on our economy. All of these false notions shape public perception and reaction to immigration reform. If we are to succeed in the next century, we need to base our decisions on facts. While America at one point had a huge influx of immigrants, today the picture is quite different. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the number of immigrants is almost four times what it was 100 years ago. But if we look at it as a percentage of the total U.S. population, we see that it is about 13%, which is not an all-time high. As recently as 20 years ago, America was the premier destination of all aspiring immigrants. Today, this is no longer the case. As a percentage of population, Canada and Australia both have significantly higher rates of foreign-born residents than the U.S., at approximately 20% and 26% respectively. In fact, America's rate of foreign-born population -- about 13% -- is now on par with those of France and Germany. America also no longer draws the smartest people from around the world. Compared with countries like Canada, New Zealand and Australia, the U.S. has a greater proportion of low-skilled rather than high-skilled immigrants. About 30% of immigrants in the U.S. possess a low level of education, and only 35% possess a high level of education. In Canada, only 22% of immigrants have a low level of education, while more than 46% have a high level of education. Countries like Canada attract a greater influx of immigrants with higher education levels and specialized skills through immigration policies that specifically favor visa applicants with advanced degrees or work experience. In contrast, U.S. policies place more emphasis on family relationships and less consideration on skills or education levels when granting permanent residence. Perhaps the most persistent modern immigration myth is that immigrants are a drain on our economy, which is simply not true. Taxes paid by immigrants and their children -- both legal and illegal -- exceed the costs of the services they use. A 2007 report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers concluded that immigration as a whole increases the U.S. GDP by roughly $37 billion each year. A cost estimate by the Congressional Budget Office in 2007 found that a path to legalization for unauthorized immigrants would increase federal revenues by $48 billion but would incur only $23 billion of increased costs from public services, producing a surplus of $25 billion for government coffers. And according to a Social Security Administration Trustees report, increases in immigration have improved Social Security's finances. The consensus of the economic analysis is that the taxes paid by immigrants and their descendants exceed the benefits they receive. Even with undocumented immigrants, the Internal Revenue Service estimates that they paid almost $50 billion in federal taxes between 1996 to 2003, including payroll and Social Security (about $8.5 billion per year), property (directly or as part of rental payments) and sales taxes. Nonetheless, about 40% of undocumented immigrants (PDF) currently work off the books and consequently pay lower taxes. But if we look at their purchasing power, we find that undocumented immigrants sustain hundreds of thousand of U.S. jobs. One study estimates (PDF) that Latino buying power totaled $951 billion in 2008 and will increase to $1.4 trillion by 2013. Asian buying power totaled $509.1 billion in 2008 and is expected to increase to $752.3 billion by 2013. Countries such as Canada and Australia realized earlier that immigration policy is intrinsically linked to their economic success. Where U.S. immigration policy attempts to address economic realities is in the H1-B visa classification for highly skilled workers. However, the caps, quotas and numbers don't really work. Ten weeks after the application filing period opened for H1-B visas for fiscal year 2013, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services had reached the statutory cap. Many American companies are struggling to fill 3.6 million job openings in the U.S., many of them in science- and technology-related fields. The cap stifles economic growth for 10 months until the next H1-B visa application filing period begins. ""The continued failure to devise and implement a sound and sustainable immigration policy threatens to weaken America's economy, to jeopardize its diplomacy, and to imperil its national security,"" concludes a Council on Foreign Relations Independent Task Force report co-chaired by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Clinton White House Chief of Staff Thomas McLarty. Just as a teenager grows up and dismisses the simplistic views espoused in the fairy tales of childhood, so too must we as a nation face the reality that we are no longer the world leader in welcoming talent. We still have a good chance in regaining the monopoly of what made our nation so great in the first place: a clustering of the best and the brightest from around the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fariborz Ghadar.","Fariborz Ghadar: Three myths about immigration must be ignored .

"Washington (CNN) -- Thousands of Department of Justice employees can breathe a little easier after learning they won't be furloughed due to forced budget cuts, but that assurance is good only until October 1, when a new fiscal year begins for the federal government. Attorney General Eric Holder sent a memo to department workers on Wednesday, which CNN obtained. It said, ""thousands of critical FBI and ATF agents, deputy U.S. marshals, prosecutors, and other department employees will remain on the job protecting national security, fighting violent crime and enforcing our laws."" Employees were expected to be furloughed as many as 14 days when across-the-board budget cuts went into effect earlier this year after the White House and Congress couldn't agree on another way to reduce the deficit. Holder said he can avoid furloughing workers for now because of new budget authority granted at the end of March and because he has moved some funds from different programs to be able to pay employees. But Holder said the more than $1.6 billion in cuts affecting various government agencies will still hurt the Justice Department because he has had to cut contract spending and training and won't be able to fill open jobs because of a hiring freeze. According to Holder, ""furloughs are a distinct possibility"" when the new fiscal year begins. Rep. Frank Wolf, the Virginia Republican who chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees Justice Department funding, sent a letter to Holder on Wednesday saying he could transfer funds to avoid the furloughs. But Wolf said if the department had not purchased Thomson prison ""those resources would have been available to cushion the impact"" of forced budget cuts. In 2012, the government bought the prison from the state of Illinois for $165 million. Many Republicans opposed the purchase and worried the administration would move Guantanamo detainees to that facility. Holder made assurances that would not happen. Holder quickly sent a letter back to Wolf saying the prison purchase was not made with money needed to run the department.","Attorney General Eric Holder says funds have been moved to keep workers on the job .

""Its many different dialects in Arabic and our analysts thought that this was Egyptian in nature.""

"(CNN) -- The death of Britain's former prime minister Margaret Thatcher has taken up column inches on front pages around the world. In keeping with the legacy of the ""Iron Lady"", reaction has been split between praise and condemnation, underscoring Thatcher's global impact -- in life and now in death. Read more: Tributes paid to 'great leader, great Briton' The English language Buenos Aires Herald said Argentina's government had been silent on the death of Thatcher, who led Britain into the 1982 war over the Falkland Islands, a territory Argentina claims and refers to as Las Malvinas. Thatcher ""was held responsible for sinking the ARA General Belgrano light cruiser outside the Maritime Exclusion Zone, killing 323 Argentine sailors,"" it said. Relatives of Argentinians killed in the war regretted that Thatcher had died before Argentina could file a lawsuit against her in the International Criminal Court at The Hague, it said. Argentine news agency Telem said most Argentinians would remember her for the Belgrano incident, while La Nacion said the few politicians who addressed her death also condemned the ship's sinking. The Falklands' Penguin News led with ""Lady Thatcher's death received with great sadness in Falkland Islands."" It said the Falklands War was ""seen as the defining moment"" in her career. In its article on Thatcher's death, the English-language Santiago Times in Chile recalled the Iron Lady's support for the country's former dictator Augusto Pinochet, whose regime it said had supplied Britain with intelligence during the Falklands War. After his arrest, it said, Thatcher praised Pinochet for bringing Chile democracy. ""Thatcher's staunch support of the dictator -- whose 17-year reign of terror included thousands of deaths and numerous human rights abuses -- was a controversial position for her to take,"" the article said. Read more: How 'Lady T' built transatlantic bridges . The Shanghai Daily carried a photo of Thatcher meeting with China's then leader Deng Xiaoping in 1982, reminding its readers that Thatcher had signed the 1987 agreement to hand Hong Kong back to China. China's Global Times praised Thatcher for recognizing that the issue of Hong Kong's sovereignty was a different from that of the Falklands. It said Thatcher's ""restoration of the British economy represented one of the last glorious achievements of Great Britain, or even Europe."" Its editorial went on to speculate that Thatcher had been the West's last ""iron"" politician ""partly because the decline in European power means they cannot uphold an iron stance."" ""The win-win spirit China brings to international politics is expanding. We have reasons to show respect to this woman that signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration. But at the same time, the world should move on,"" its editorial writer declared. The South China Morning Post carried a poll on whether Thatcher signed away Hong Kong too easily. South Africa's Mail and Guardian reported a ""mixed response"" to the death of a woman who believed in engaging with the country's apartheid regime and who described the ANC as a ""terrorist organization."" Commentator Susan Booysen told the newspaper Thatcher's opposition to economic sanctions helped ""keep up"" the apartheid government. South Africa's Times said the ""divisive effect"" of Thatcher's foreign policies were still felt in the country. It quoted former foreign minister Pik Botha as saying she had done more to help end apartheid than any of her contemporary leaders, while the ANC highlighted Thatcher's ""failure to isolate apartheid after it had been described as a crime against humanity'."" Read more: Twitter reactions . The Moscow Times said Thatcher -- an ""outspoken opponent of communism"" -- had publicly backed perestroika, the movement led by leader Mikhail Gorbachev to reform the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the 1980s. A former translator for Gorbachev, Pavel Palazchenko, told the newspaper that Thatcher had ""helped change attitudes"" towards Russia. ""Without doubt, she played an instrumental role in ending the Cold War,"" it quoted him as saying. In his L.A. Times column, Jonah Goldberg wrote that Thatcher destroyed socialism rather than liberalism -- forcing Labour's Tony Blair to ""to repudiate the party's century-long support for doctrinaire socialism and embrace the market"" and U.S. Democrat Bill Clinton to follow suit. ""That's one reason the left still hates her so much -- because she won, at least in her time,"" Goldberg concluded. The International Herald Tribune said it could be argued that her military successes had ""made it easier for Mr. Blair to carelessly and recklessly follow George W. Bush into Iraq."" ""But Mrs. Thatcher knew how to stand up to Ronald Reagan when she needed to â€” for example, over the ill-considered United States invasion of Grenada,"" the newspaper said. The Washington Post headlined its editorial: ""Margaret Thatcher: In every sense, a leader."" ""She strengthened Britain's ties with the United States, bolstered its military, supported the placement of intermediate-range missiles in Europe (an extremely controversial move at the time) and spoke out with undiplomatic boldness when she took offense at some countries' actions,"" it said. The Post speculated that she might have retained the premiership longer if she had been more flexible -- adding ""but then of course she wouldn't have been Maggie Thatcher."" Read more: Reagan and Thatcher: 'Political soulmates' French newspaper Le Monde wrote that the 1980s were the years of ""Maggie"", who it said reinvented economic liberalism -- alongside Reagan. Thatcher's legacy continued with Blair's ""third way"" and Clinton's policies, it said in its editorial. In Le Figaro, Pierre Rousselin wrote that Thatcher ""never wanted to please everybody."" ""Uncompromising on principles, she hated false consensus policies that solved nothing,"" he said. ""France and Europe today may well need leaders of her ilk,"" Rousselin added. However, in Germany, Der Spiegel wrapped up editorial comment in the country under the headline ""'Thatcher's Dogma Paved Way for Financial Crisis'."" Some newspapers had highlighted her forceful personality while ""some conclude, however, that her policies were too radical, and that Thatcherism no longer offers the answers to the economic problems of today,"" David Crossland wrote. In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mail called for a state funeral for ""The woman who saved Britain."" Its headline contrasted with the Daily Mirror's: ""The woman who divided a nation."" The Mirror's editorial was headed: ""Margaret Thatcher broke Britain and replaced it with something crueller and nastier.""

"Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- The father of American student Amanda Knox says prosecutors have ""no case left,"" after an Italian judge rejected a request for new DNA testing of evidence. ""It really appears to me that they want to find the truth,"" Curt Knox said of Judge Claudio Pratillo Hellman's decision Wednesday. ""I'm very hopeful that by the end of the month, we'll be able to bring Amanda and Rafael home."" Amanda Knox is fighting her conviction for killing her British housemate, Meredith Kercher. Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Rafael Sollecito, were found guilty of the killing in 2009. The judge also rejected prosecution efforts to introduce newly found records about the original testing and to hear a new witness -- all victories for Knox's defense, which opposed the motions. Curt Knox said his daughter is ""handling it a step at a time. She's not pessimistic by any means. But she's also not saying, you know, I'm coming home."" He told CNN that the family will be allowed to see Amanda on Friday and will have a better sense of her reaction to the court's decision then. Still, he acknowledged that ""it was very good news for Amanda."" Even the prosecutor's office told CNN that its attorneys are less certain of the outcome. The prosecution is still confident that the verdict will be upheld, but is aware that it could go either way, the office said. But Francesco Maresca, an attorney for the Kercher family, said that the rulings were not a defeat and that he understood why the judge rejected the requests. The judge adjourned the hearing until September 23 when final arguments are expected to begin. The earliest possible verdict date is September 29 under a timetable the judge released Wednesday. Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of the killing two years after Kercher's semi-naked body was found in the house they shared in Perugia. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito got 25. A third defendant, Rudy Guede, was convicted in a separate fast-track trial. Knox and Sollecito are appealing their convictions together, having been convicted in a joint trial. Attorneys for Knox and Sollecito this week have worked to cast doubt on DNA evidence found on the knife and Kercher's bra clasp. DNA on the knife used to kill Kercher could not have been from blood, a forensic expert testifying for Knox's defense told the court Wednesday. Carlo Torre, one of Italy's best-known forensics experts, presented a detailed technical argument about the DNA on the knife. Prosecutors in 2009 said there were traces of Knox's genetic material on the handle and Kercher's in a tiny groove on the blade. Sara Gino, another defense witness, testified Wednesday that Sollecito's genetic material could have gotten onto the bloodied bra if it was on Knox's clothes when they were washed with Kercher's before the killing. Other experts working for the defense argued this summer that the Sollecito DNA allegedly found on the bra clasp should be ""inadmissible."" Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conti said the clasp was ""dirty"" and had been allowed to rust, making further testing futile. Vecchiotti has also testified that tests for blood on the knife were negative, and that the amount of DNA said to be Kercher's was so low, it could not be examined again with any conclusions. But Italian state police forensic expert Patrizia Stefanoni defended Tuesday the methods and the equipment used in the investigation. Stefanoni said the machine used for the DNA examination was clean and rejected suggestions the clasp had been contaminated. She said it had been moved but not turned over or stepped on at the scene. CNN's Hada Messia and Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","NEW: Curt Knox is hopeful his daughter will be home by the end of the month .

"(CNN) -- Fifty years after the Second Vatican Council was meant to represent the beginning of a ""world church"" in the Catholic Church, the Catholic Church is still predominantly Eurocentric in her teachings, structures, and personnel. The shift in the center of gravity in world Christianity from the West to the global South, and the changing demographics in world Christianity, demands that the Eurocentric types and models of church and Christianity need to be abandoned. African Catholicism, like all local Catholic Churches throughout the world, can only flourish when it has the freedom to mine local and cultural resources and to develop its own narrative of faith and life, while embracing the positive heritage of Catholic and Christian history. Read more: Why the next pope should be African . In the West, many Catholics are calling on the future pope to use his authority to address the causes and consequences of the clerical sexual abuse crisis. Other issues which many Western Christians see as needing urgent action are clerical celibacy, the place of women in the church, the problems of a high rate of divorce, the place of homosexuals in the church, the anguish of divorced and separated Catholics, the use and abuse of authority in the church, and some of the polarizing arguments on abortion and contraception. However, sometimes these problems in their Western variants are presented as the universal templates to view the challenges facing the Catholic Church in all parts of the world. Similar problems do exist in African Catholicism, but they manifest themselves in different ways and for different reasons. In African Catholicism, for example, there are few incidents of pedophile priests, but that does not mean that the church in Africa does not have its own demons with regard to sexual misdemeanors of its clergy with adult females. Many Africans value families because having children is the only way an African achieves personal immortality, by becoming an ancestor. As a result, the concern of some African Catholics for the church to have an open and honest discussion on celibacy is not driven out of concern for the loneliness or isolation that priests suffer in the West, but rather by the belief that having a wife and children culturally enhances one's humanity and is a good thing for the community and the individual priest. Some African Catholic priests and bishops who secretly have had their own children were driven not simply by some unchecked and repressed libidinous upsurge, but by a cultural pressure to procreate and thus guarantee ancestral life beyond death. Watch video: Contender to be the first black pope? Most African Catholic women do not wish to be able to become Catholic priests like their Western counterparts. On the other hand, many African women in the Catholic Church are silently bearing the weight of an African brand of Catholicism that reinforces a traditional African patriarchal mentality that women should not have a voice, and that they should be subordinate to men. African Catholic women would like to see the end to all kinds of sexual, physical, and emotional abuses of women in marriages, sexual harassment and exploitation in public offices and in some churches, and the suppression of the rights of women in African society. African Catholic women are praying for a future pope who will encourage African religious leaders to commit themselves to defending the rights of women to inheritance, land and to divorce, so that gender equality and respect for the dignity of the African woman can be achieved. Whereas abortion and contraception are divisive issues in Western Catholicism, most African Catholics embrace this teaching because most African cultures reject abortion and contraception. However, African Catholics are more concerned that the use of condoms to prevent HIV/AIDS should be understood as a therapeutic means to protect and preserve life. It should be seen in this light as actually a morally legitimate pro-life act, rather than anti-life. African Catholics look forward to the future pope introducing new and effective measures to check the seeming absolute powers and privileges of African bishops and priests. There is a troubling clericalism in African Catholicism that is similar to, and in some cases worse than, the dictatorial tendencies, corruption and lack of accountability among African politicians. Read also: Africa's rocky road to democracy . The poverty in Africa is shocking and sinful; the social condition of the continent is perplexing, and the human suffering is not only unacceptable, but also inexcusable. The reason that religion is so central to Africans, and for the appeal of Catholicism, is because most Africans believe that God can intervene in their longs nights and dark days of suffering and uncertainty about the future. Many Africans hope that the future pope will challenge his fellow African bishops and priests to become the voice of the voiceless, and to not live above the people or exploit their vulnerability. Religion, and Christianity in particular, has become for many Africans a shopping mall where they experiment with all kinds of solutions to their existential problems. Many might argue that African Christianity lacks depth because people's allegiance to one church or religion is not firm: an African Catholic can consult with an African traditional healer in the morning and take the same problem to a Pentecostal pastor in the afternoon, and then bring the same issue for prayer at a Catholic Mass in the evening. However, in an atmosphere of so much suffering and pain, the search for religious options becomes a viable pathway. African Catholics expect the next pope to raise the bar of ethical, prophetic, sacrificial, and servant leadership in African Catholicism -- and to hoist the banner of righteousness and moral rectitude, and political activism and solidarity, to lift millions of Africans from the pit of poverty so that they will have a voice and contribute in building a better society. The African church should be a church of the poor, a church with the poor, a church for the poor and a church that is on the side of the poor so as to give them a voice. Next pope from Africa or Latin America? Africans, like most Catholics, hope that the future pope will be a humble, holy, wise and compassionate servant leader, who is able to communicate the teachings of the Catholic Church with compassion and tenderness. Such a pope must also be a listening pope who will not be afraid to engage the modern world, in order to discern the signs of the times and embrace the beauty of the new revelations which God is manifesting in today's world. What do you think should be the next pope's top priority in Africa? Leave a comment below. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stan Chu Ilo.","Catholic Church is still predominantly Eurocentric, argues Stan Chu Ilo .

"Washington (CNN) -- The White House grooved to the Motown sound Thursday night, with an all-star lineup performing some of the most memorable songs from the hit factory that started in a Detroit basement. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama hosted the tribute to the music from Berry Gordy Jr.'s Motown Record Corp. in a concert that will be broadcast on PBS later this year. It's part of its ""In Performance at the White House"" series. Clapping, swaying and singing in the audience were Gordy himself, Motown superstars Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson, Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, and the Obamas as the music that helped shape a generation and beyond filled the East Room. Obama called Motown's tunes the ""soundtrack of the civil rights era"" and cited how the popularity of music by Robinson and others crossed the color barrier to bring together racially mixed audiences. He recounted the origins of Motown, with Gordy borrowing $800 to set up operations in the basement of a house on Detroit's West Grand Boulevard. Wonder also paid tribute to Gordy, saying people would be singing and dancing to Motown music for centuries to come. Actor and singer Jamie Foxx added an unpredictable element to the proceedings as master of ceremonies, challenging Obama to dance at one point, poking fun at Biden and changing the lyrics of the Temptations' ""Get Ready"" for the occasion by singing, ""We won the e-lec-tion. The White House, babe, so much fun."" Speaking of Gordy, Foxx said the money from his publishing royalties could help erase the federal deficit and signaled to Obama that he and Gordy should talk. When Foxx said ""We're gonna paint the White House black,"" he immediately joked ""Uh oh, look at all this security,"" and mimicked a security agent coming after him. Foxx, John Legend, Seal and Nick Jonas opened with a Temptations' medley that included brief renditions of ""Get Ready,"" ""The Way You Do the Things You Do,"" ""I Can't Get Next To You"" and ""Ain't Too Proud To Beg."" Next up was Sheryl Crow, a former backup singer for Michael Jackson, who performed the Jackson 5 hit ""I Want You Back,"" followed by Jonas singing ""I Can't Help Myself"" by the Four Tops. Ledisi sang the Mary Wells hit ""My Guy,"" and Legend returned to perform Marvin Gaye's ""Heard It Through the Grapevine,"" which Crow introduced as the greatest Motown hit of all time. The trio of Natasha Bedingfield, Jordin Sparks and Ledisi sang the Supremes' ""Stop in the Name of Love,"" complete with the hand-up dance move on the chorus. Seal returned in his silver shoes to croon the Temptations' hit ""My Girl."" Bedingfield then sang Robinson's ""Tracks of My Tears"" as Smokey clapped and sang along in the audience, followed by Amber Riley of the television program ""Glee"" performing Wonder's ""Living for the City"" twice -- there was a technical glitch the first time. The band Gloriana did ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"" a hit by Gaye with Tammi Terrell as well as Diana Ross, and Mark Salling of ""Glee"" performed yet another Temptations' hit ""Just My Imagination."" After Sparks returned for the Supremes' ""Can't Hurry Love,"" Robinson finally took the stage with Crow for a duet on his hit, ""You Really Got a Hold on Me,"" and then Wonder followed with his classic, ""You Are the Sunshine of My Life."" ""Berry, thank you for this incredible Motown ride,"" Wonder said, calling for the crowd to celebrate by ""dancing in the streets"" to introduce the showstopper of the same name, joined by all the other performers, as well as Martha Reeves of Martha and the Vandellas. In a bit of Motown soul, Reeves brought down the band in the middle of the song to improvise some praise for Gordy as the music continued lightly, and then the Obamas and daughter Sasha took the stage for the rousing finish.","President Barack Obama hosts an all-star concert to be broadcast on PBS .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- There's no doubt that Iran's election will be a major test for incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. But many Iranian women hope the results will also shake the current status of women in the Islamic republic. Zahra Rahnavard, wife of Iranian candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, has taken a visible role in the campaign. ""Thirty-four million women demand to have female Cabinet ministers; 34 million women demand to be eligible to run for president,"" Zahra Rahnavard, wife of reformist candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. ""Thirty-four million women want the civil law to be revised; 34 million women want the family law revised."" Whether her husband wins or loses Friday, Rahnavard has broken barriers for women just by appearing on the campaign trail with her husband, a rarity for political wives in Iran. ""We look at her, and we say, 'We want to be like her in the future,' "" said Shakiba Shakerhosseie, an Iranian woman who packed into Tehran's indoor Azadi (Freedom) sports stadium along with nearly 12,000 others to hear Rahnavard speak in March. Rahnavard is a mother of three, as well as an accomplished artist and academic. She has been compared to first ladies in the United States, including Michelle Obama, for her visible role in her husband's quest for the presidency. ""I am here to say that men and women are equal,"" Rahnavard said. Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile. The revolution also ended the ceremonial role of first lady that the last queen, Farah, enjoyed. More women than men have voted in the past few elections, and Rahnavard has made a promise to her female supporters that their vote will count this time if Moussavi wins. ""We have made this promise to the women, and we will stand by it,"" she said. Iranian women remain second-class citizens in criminal matters, divorce, child custody and inheritance cases, despite making up 65 percent of university students. Ahmadinejad's fundamentalist government has tried to make it easier for men to take more than one wife while restricting public sector careers for women. This year, for the first time, the Guardian Council announced that a woman could legally be among the final candidate list. Out of the 42 women who registered, however, none was ultimately allowed to stand. Even Zahra Eshraghi, granddaughter of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini, was banned from running for parliament as a reformist. ""For Ahmadinejad's government, women are just living things,"" Eshraghi said. ""A woman is there to fill her husband's stomach and raise children.""  Watch one analyst talk about women in Ahmadinejad's Iran » . Moussavi is not the only candidate calling for a stronger role for women in Iran. Mehdi Karroubi, the only cleric in the presidential race, has promised to campaign for women's rights. Hard-line conservative candidate Mohsen Rezaie also said he would have female ministers if he wins the election. Political science professor Mohammad Marandi downplayed Rahnavard's impact on the outcome of Friday's election. He said she may win over reformists and women, but what will win the election is a solution to the floundering economy and a strong performance in the debates. iReport.com: Iranians rally in large numbers . ""If Ahmadinejad does well in the debates, I don't think anyone will be able to defeat him,"" Marandi said. But try selling that to Rahnavard's enthusiastic supporters. ""This is the first time after the revolution we see a lady behind the president,"" Farhad Mahmoudi said. ""And this is why we're so happy, because we can have a first lady.""

"(CNN) -- At least 53 people were killed and eight others injured in a reported grenade attack Thursday at a casino in Monterrey, Mexico, the capital of Nuevo Leon, Red Cross officials said. The incident occurred around 4 p.m. local time (5 p.m. ET) at the Casino Royale when two people aboard a vehicle arrived, and one threw three grenades into the building. There were conflicting unconfirmed reports from local media that the assailants poured gasoline on the building before setting it on fire. Between 20 and 30 people were trapped in the casino because of debris from the explosions, said Cmdr. Angel Flores with the Green Cross. Video from the scene showed a burned-out building as firefighters made rescue attempts to break the wall of the facade of the casino to release the smoke inside the building. Authorities had suspended rescue efforts Thursday night for fear that the building could collapse. Mexican President Felipe Calderon sent the following statement from his official Twitter account (translated from Spanish): ""With deep consternation, I express my solidarity with Nuevo Leon and the victims of this abhorrent act of terror and barbarism."" He added more: ""These reprehensible acts require us all to persevere in the fight against gangs of unscrupulous criminals. All the support to NL (Nuevo Leon)."" About five families were outside the casino waiting for information from authorities, local journalist Javier Estrada reported. Gustavo Madrazo was one of those waiting outside the casino. He said his wife, Martha, and her sister, Miriam Gonzalez, were inside. Authorities have not identified any of the victims. So far, no representative for the company that manages the casino had arrived outside. The Mexican Army and state and municipal police forces were also on the scene. Alejandro Poire, Mexico's top national security spokesman, said the federal government has made contact with local officials and that Calderon has spoken to the governor of Nuevo Leon to offer support. Poire said those who carried out the attacks will be held responsible. ""They will pay for their crimes. ... We will do absolutely everything ... to restore tranquility."" The National Commission on Human Rights in Mexico sent a news release saying it has opened an investigation regarding the response to the events at the casino. ""The priority is to help safeguard the human rights enshrined in the Constitution of the United Mexican States and international treaties. The commission again makes clear that the insecurity in the country requires public officials responsible for implementing and enforcing the law, carry out preventive actions to protect society and away from any violence."" ""The National Commission will monitor the actions taken by the competent authorities to respond adequately to the aggrieved persons."" The NHRC says it has also sent personnel to the scene including physicians, psychologists and lawyers to work jointly with authorities. Nuevo Leon, in northeastern Mexico, has seen several grenade attacks so far this year. On August 13, four civilians were wounded when an armed group fired two grenades at a jail in the municipality of Apodaca. In July, gunmen entered a downtown bar in Monterrey and shot 20 people dead. A public safety spokesman told CNN the attack was likely sparked by a dispute between organized crime groups for control of the El Sabino Gordo nightclub, where drugs were allegedly sold. Nuevo Leon and the neighboring states of Coahuila and Tamaulipas have been the scene of a series of clashes between organized crime groups. The Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas are vying for control of trafficking routes into the United States. In November 2010, the federal government launched the Coordinated Operation Northeast, which involves sending more security forces to the area to tackle crime.

"(CNN) -- A 46-year-old man from Austin, Texas, died Sunday during the swim portion of the Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon in San Francisco, according to race officials. ""We have reason to believe the gentleman suffered from a massive cardiac event as he entered the water and began the swim,"" race director Bill Burke said in a statement. ""Water safety noticed him immediately and initiated CPR while he was in the water and as they transferred him to land,"" he added. Burke said he believes the man's death marks the first in the triathlon's 33-year history. ""The thoughts and prayers of the entire Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon team are with the family and friends of the racer as they mourn this loss,"" he said. The statement did not identify the triathlete who died. 'A lot of people seemed to be having trouble on the swim' The race, which took place in June last year, was scheduled earlier this year to accommodate the 2013 America's Cup. The change in date meant athletes competed in colder conditions. Approximately 2,000 people take part in the race each year, according to the Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon website. The competition includes a 1.5 mile swim from Alcatraz Island, an 18-mile bike race and an 8-mile run. Alcatraz Island, in the San Francisco Bay, is known for a high-security prison that operated there for some 30 years before closing in 1963. Officially, no one ever escaped from Alcatraz, but a handful of prisoners who attempted to escape were never found and remain listed as ""missing and presumed drowned,"" according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.","The 46-year-old man is said to have suffered a ""massive cardiac event""

"(CNN) -- Colorado Springs police have arrested a man whom authorities want to question in relation to the March shooting death of prison chief Tom Clements. James Lohr, described by police as a member of a white supremacist prison gang, is an associate of Evan Ebel, the man suspected of killing Clements, Lt. Jeff Kramer of the El Paso County, Colorado, sheriff's office said. Lohr had three outstanding arrest warrants unrelated to the Clements investigation, and it was not immediately clear whether he is facing new charges. Lohr is scheduled to receive a court advisement via video in El Paso County on Monday afternoon. Arrested after a police chase, Lohr is facing accusations of felony vehicular eluding and three traffic offenses -- reckless driving, speeding and failing to obey a traffic control devise, the sheriff's office said. Authorities also recovered a gun allegedly thrown from Lohr's vehicle during the chase. A business surveillance video caught a man picking up the firearm. It was turned in to law enforcement to be used as evidence, Kramer said. Questions haunt prisons chief slaying case . In addition to Lohr, police were on the lookout for another Ebel associate, Thomas Guolee, 31. Meanwhile, authorities were questioning another two people associated with Ebel, whom a source close to the investigation declined to name. Exclusive: Anger 'won't bring him back:' Wife of slain prisons chief . Police want to question Lohr and Guolee -- whom police described as associates of the white supremacist 211 Crew gang -- in relation to the death of Clements. Ebel, the man suspected of shooting the chief, was also a 211 Crew member. He died in a shootout with Texas deputies. The other two men, brought in for questioning in recent days by El Paso County authorities, are also 211 Crew members, the source said. Both associated with Ebel in the days before Clements' death, the source said, and at least one is a parolee. Authorities have also served a search warrant related to one of them, the source said. The source declined to say what the warrant named. Two men questioned as manhunt continues . Investigators have said they were looking into whether Ebel might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements. Clements was widely recognized for cracking down on prison gangs, including the 211 Crew. Ebel also is suspected in the killing of part-time pizza deliveryman Nathan Leon. Authorities have speculated Ebel might have killed Leon for his uniform so he could use it as a disguise in the killing of Clements, who was gunned down on March 19 after he opened his front door. Due to a clerical error, Ebel had been released early on parole, which he later violated. He had been sentenced to eight years in prison in 2005 for armed robbery. In 2008, he was sentenced to another four years -- to be served consecutively -- for punching a prison guard. Two days after Clements was killed, Ebel died in northern Texas in a gun battle with authorities that left a sheriff's deputy wounded.

"(Mental Floss) -- Remember that goofy uncle of yours who always tried to impress you by ""stealing your nose"" or pulling the ol' separating-his-thumb-from-his-hand move? Well, those parlor tricks are nothing compared to the appendage stunts pulled by these 10 famous people. John Wilkes Booth's neck bones . A painting of Napoleon in His Study by Jacques-Louis-David doesn't give a hint at what body part went missing. John Wilkes Booth might have been a successful assassin, but he was a largely ineffectual escape artist. Just 12 days after murdering President Abraham Lincoln, Booth was shot in the back of the neck and killed. His body was (eventually) buried in an unmarked grave at Baltimore's Green Mount Cemetery. His third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae, however, were removed during the autopsy so investigators could access the bullet. For a peek at those bits of Booth's spinal column, just check out the display at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Washington, D.C. Einstein's brain . Before he died, über-genius Albert Einstein considered donating his body to science. Unfortunately, he never put his wishes in writing. When he passed away in 1955, Einstein's family and friends made plans to cremate him, but the pathologist who performed the autopsy, Dr. Thomas Harvey, had a different idea. Instead, he opted to remove the math man's brain and then tell the family about it. For 30-some years, Harvey had Al's gray matter tucked away in his Wichita home in two Mason jars. Naturally, Einstein's loved ones weren't thrilled when they found out, but they eventually allowed the misappropriated mind to be sliced into 240 sections and disbursed to researchers for examination. Today, many of the cerebral sections remain in scientific institutions, with the bulk held at Princeton Hospital. As for Einstein's body, that was cremated and scattered in a secret location. ""Stonewall"" Jackson's arm . Confederate General Thomas Jackson got his nickname by sitting astride his horse ""like a stone wall"" while bullets whizzed around him during the Civil War. But that kind of bravery (or foolhardiness) didn't serve him well. During the Battle of Chancellorsville, Jackson was accidentally shot in the arm by one of his own men. Said arm had to be amputated, and afterward, it was buried in the nearby Virginia town of Ellwood. Only eight days later, Stonewall was stone-cold dead of pneumonia. The rest of his body is resting in peace in Lexington, Virginia. Saint Francis Xavier's hand . Francis Xavier was a saint with a few too many fans. In the early 16th century, the Spanish missionary was sent to Asia by the king of Portugal to convert as many souls to Christianity as possible. Turns out, he was pretty good at the job. Francis Xavier became wildly popular, and after his death in 1552, so did his relics. In fact, demand out-fueled supply. Throughout several years and multiple exhumations, his body was whittled away. Today, half his left hand is in Cochin, India, while the other half is in Malacca, Malaysia. One of his arms resides in Rome, and various other cities lay claim to his internal organs. The leftovers? They went to Goa, India. Napoleon's bits and pieces . Exiled emperor Napoleon Bonaparte died on May 5, 1821. The following day, doctors conducted an autopsy, which was reportedly witnessed by many people, including a priest named Ange Vignali. Though the body was said to be largely intact at the time of the undertaking, it seems the priest took home a souvenir. In 1916, Vignali's heirs sold a collection of Napoleonic artifacts, including what they claim to be the emperor's penis. While no one knows for sure if it really is Napoleon's, uh, manhood, people have paid good money for the penis. Currently, it's in the possession of an American urologist. Oliver Cromwell's head . Oliver Cromwell, the straight-laced Puritan who usurped the English throne, wasn't exactly a wild man. His head, however, was sometimes the life of the party. Cromwell died in 1658, but two years later, the reinstated English monarchy exhumed, tried, and hanged his body, then dumped it in an unmarked grave. In addition, as a warning to would-be killers, his head was placed on a pike in Westminster Hall, where it remained for 20 years. After a subsequent stint in a small museum, it was sold in 1814 to a man named Josiah Henry Wilkinson (perhaps looking to parade it around as an exceptionally gruesome ice-breaker at parties). Such was the ironic afterlife of the Puritan until 1960, when his head was finally laid to rest in a chapel in Cambridge. E-mail to a friend . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"Rome (CNN) -- The parents of Amanda Knox, an American convicted of murdering her British roommate in 2007, were indicted Tuesday for allegedly libeling police in Perugia, Italy, Knox's mother and the family's Italian attorney said. In a 2009 interview in the Sunday Times of London, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas said that their daughter ""had not been given an interpreter, had not received food and water and had been physically and verbally abused"" by police after her arrest for the murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher, according to Italy's ANSA news agency. They also said police struck her and told her ""things will get worse for you"" if she requested an attorney. ""Yes, I am going to trial for libel ... along with one of my lawyers and a group of journalists,"" Mellas told CNN Tuesday. ""We are very upset by this decision,"" said Luciano Ghirga, Amanda Knox's attorney who represents her family in this case. ""We worked towards a dismissal because there was no intent"" on the part of Knox's parents to libel the police, he said. The indictment says their claims were ""contrary to the truth,"" according to ANSA. A hearing in the case is set for July 4, Ghirga said. ""These are old charges,"" said David Marriott, spokesman for the family. ""They've been around since 2009."" The story in question was published in 2008, he said, and Knox's parents were repeating what their daughter had told them. The indictment, Marriott said, finalizes the charges the prosecutor had filed and is ""nothing surprising."" Knox's parents' focus is not on their case, he said, but on her appeal of her conviction, which is under way. There is a break in the proceedings for experts to retest forensic evidence, he said. ""This is, I guess you'd call it, a bit of a minor distraction,"" Marriott said. Knox, 23, was sentenced in December to 26 years in prison for Kercher's death at the villa the two shared in Perugia, the central Italian town where both were students. Kercher, 21, was found dead in November 2007, semi-naked with her throat slashed. Knox and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were both found guilty of the murder. Sollecito is serving a 25-year sentence. A third person, Rudy Guede, a drifter originally from the Ivory Coast, was tried separately and is serving a 16-year prison sentence. The forensic experts retesting evidence as part of Knox's appeal must conclude their analysis by May 9 and their results are to be presented on May 21 to a jury composed of two judges and six citizens. Evidence being retested includes a knife found in Sollecito's apartment with Knox's DNA on the handle and what Perugia prosecutors say is Kercher's DNA in a tiny groove on the blade. The prosecution contends that the knife was used to stab Kercher in the neck and that it had been cleaned. The DNA matter attributed to Kercher consists of flesh, not blood, they say. The sample, however, was so small that forensic scientists investigating Kercher's murder were not able to double test it in accordance with international forensic science norms, which Knox's legal team says raises doubts about its validity. The second piece of evidence the forensic experts will test is the tiny metal clasp from Kercher's bra, which was cut from her body after her slaying. Forensic scientists in the investigatory phase determined that Sollecito's DNA is present on the metal clasp. The clasp was identified on an investigatory video on November 2, 2007, when Kercher's body was found. But the clasp was not collected until nearly six weeks later, giving the defense cause to question whether the sample may have been contaminated. The court is not expected to make a final ruling on the appeal until next summer.

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- When President Obama took the stage Thursday night, he wasn't just competing with the ghosts of conventions present, but with Mitt Romney's performance last week, Bill Clinton's Wednesday, and the first lady's on Tuesday. He had to take on the ghosts of conventions past: comparisons with his stadium acceptance speech four years ago, and the 2004 speech that launched him into the national spotlight. Those would be tough performances to match in any year -- near-impossible under current circumstances. So he didn't even try: A good deal of the speech came across a bit like a State of the Union address with fewer Republicans and better lighting. But there were a few marks he had to hit -- and did. • He had to acknowledge that things aren't rosy: ""The first time I addressed this convention in 2004, I was a younger man; a Senate candidate from Illinois who spoke about hope -- not blind optimism or wishful thinking, but hope in the face of difficulty; hope in the face of uncertainty; that dogged faith in the future which has pushed this nation forward, even when the odds are great; even when the road is long..."" Four years later: Are you better off? If you're keeping score, that's at least four references to struggle -- difficulty, uncertainty, great odds, a long road -- in a single sentence. ""Eight years later, that hope has been tested -- by the cost of war; by one of the worst economic crises in history; and by political gridlock that's left us wondering whether it's still possible to tackle the challenges of our time. ""...I recognize that times have changed since I first spoke to this convention. The times have changed -- and so have I."" Opinion: How did President Obama do? • But he had to paint a plausible picture of rosier times down the road -- offer a concrete path forward, and give skeptical voters the feeling that the next four years could be different than the first: . ""But know this, America: Our problems can be solved. Our challenges can be met. The path we offer may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And I'm asking you to choose that future. ..."" ""(A)s I stand here tonight, I have never been more hopeful about America...."" ""I'm hopeful because of you."" And there were roughly a dozen more references to hope scattered through the speech. • Hitting the right notes: He had to hit the bipartisan notes that the incredibly vanishing swing voters still tell pollsters they're looking for. Opinion: We're in for a heck of a ride . ""Last summer, I worked with Republicans in Congress to cut $1 trillion in spending . ""Now, I'm still eager to reach an agreement based on the principles of my bipartisan debt commission. No party has a monopoly on wisdom. No democracy works without compromise."" Absent were direct references to the stimulus or Obama's health care plan -- both partisan flashpoints that still get mixed reviews from voters in most opinion polls. • Drawing contrasts: But he had to draw a sharp contrast with Republicans on issues where he's got public opinion on his side, like tax cuts for the wealthy. Opinion: Obama speaks to Americans as adults . ""But when Governor Romney and his allies in Congress tell us we can somehow lower our deficit by spending trillions more on new tax breaks for the wealthy -- well, you do the math. I refuse to go along with that. And as long as I'm President, I never will."" Of course, there may be a pretty short shelf life on the political impact of anything he had to say Thursday. When President Obama spoke, he was probably the only person in the arena who knew what the job numbers coming out first thing the next morning would be: A healthy showing that could turbo-charge any convention bounce - or a disappointing showing that could short-circuit it. ""America, I never said this journey would be easy, and I won't promise that now,"" he said, at the tail end of a speech that put a spotlight on struggle. ""Yes, our path is harder -- but it leads to a better place."" Obama urges voters to secure the change he started .","President Obama had a high bar after recent dramatic speeches .
Convention speech acknowledges things aren't rosy in the country .
He points to better times ahead and suggests a path to get there ."
"(CNN) -- Call it good timing, divine intervention or just dumb luck. What started out as a wee-hours traffic stop wound up catapulting a 30-year-old California real estate attorney and reserve sheriff's deputy into an unfamiliar -- and uncomfortable -- role: that of hero. It was Shervin Lalezary who put the cuffs on Harry Burkhart, a 24-year-old German national whom Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca called ""perhaps ... the most dangerous arsonist in the county of Los Angeles that I can recall."" Burkhart is suspected of setting a rash of car and building fires across the city. Following his arrest, no more suspicious fires were documented in Los Angeles, authorities said. Lalezary was working his $1-per-year job as a reserve deputy with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department early January 2. Normally a part-time deputy, the Tehran, Iran, native had been working full time for four days as a spate of arson fires -- more than 50 in all -- had Angelenos on alert. ""You just got the sense that everyone in the city was on edge, rightfully so, because of what was happening,"" Lalezary told reporters. He recalled ""seeing residents flee from their homes and basically run for their lives."" Armed with a description of a possible suspect and vehicle gleaned from a surveillance video released by police, Lalezary pulled over a van and shone a spotlight inside. The man he saw fit the description -- a white male adult with a short ponytail and a receding hairline. ""That was very distinct information about a person,"" Lalezary said. The sighting ""was a big key."" At the same time, two Los Angeles police officers, seeing Lalezary put on his flashing lights to initiate the traffic stop, pulled in behind him. Questions remain about how much Lalezary knew about the man in the van when he pulled him over. The U.S. State Department said its agents recognized Burkhart on the surveillance video from a separate investigation and shared their knowledge with Los Angeles authorities. Lalezary and the sheriff's department have stayed mum on that aspect. Asked why he pulled the van over, Lalezary flashed a boyish grin and said only, ""Information that we had on him ... on the vehicle he was driving. There was a good deal of information being circulated."" But it was Lalezary who was thrust into the spotlight. Questioned by reporters hungry for more about him, he deftly deflected questions about himself and his personal life, choosing to praise the deputies at the sheriff's West Hollywood station. ""As a reserve deputy, I've seen what they do, and I've sat next to them in the car shift after shift after shift, and I have tremendous respect for what they do,"" he said. ""They take the reserve program extremely seriously, and they treat us as one of them when we're in the car."" He declined to talk about any statements Burkhart may have made at the time, as well as his own emotional state. Lalezary responded politely to an e-mail request for an interview but referred questions to the sheriff's department. He signed the e-mail, ""Warmly, Shervin."" ""He is very humble. He's a good kid,"" said sheriff's Capt. Phil Hansen, who heads the department's Reserve Forces Bureau. He said Lalezary's reticence to accept accolades and his insistence on sharing credit with other officers may be part of the culture -- especially among the reserves. ""Part of being a reserve is striking that balance, because you're not full time,"" Hansen said. Lalezary attended both UCLA and the University of Southern California, Baca said. He received his law degree at USC, according to the State Bar of California, which lists his law office as being on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills. He was admitted to the bar in 2008. ""I've been interested in both law and law enforcement for several years, and I think each influences the other,"" he told reporters. After moving from Iran with his family, Lalezary grew up in Beverly Hills, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Lalezary credits his family and upbringing with his desire to give back to the community, Whitmore said. ""He really does just want to provide community service to West Hollywood,"" Whitmore said. While reserve deputies are required to work a minimum of 20 hours a month, Whitmore said Lalezary ""loves it so much, he's out once or twice a week in a patrol car."" Lalezary's younger brother Shawn is also a reserve deputy and told reporters he now has ""big shoes to fill."" ""I'll continue to strive to be as good of a brother and deputy as he is,"" Shawn Lalezary said. The incident has focused attention on reserve deputies, a program used nationwide to provide support for sheriff's departments. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has 844 reserve deputies in a variety of settings, including mounted patrols on horseback, search and rescue teams, dive teams and helicopter pilots, Hansen said. The reserve deputies undergo the same training as full-time deputies, except the classes are offered on nights and weekends rather than during the day, he said. And reserve deputies, with only a token salary, are subject to many of the same hazards as regular officers. A Facebook page, ""In Memory of our Auxiliary Police Officers,"" provides a lengthy list of reserve and auxiliary officers who died in the line of duty nationwide. When patrolling, Hansen notes, ""You never know what you're rolling up on."" Reserve deputies provided 175,000 hours to the sheriff's department last year, Baca said. ""That's a tremendous resource for our department,"" the sheriff said. ""They're a huge part of what we do. These are people that really step forward and literally at times put their life on the line for a dollar a year."" Requirements for being a Los Angeles County reserve deputy include being a U.S. citizen, passing a thorough background check, holding a high school diploma and being employed or a full-time student. They are much the same requirements as for regular police officers or sheriff's deputies, Hansen said. Lalezary became a Level 1 reserve deputy -- meaning he could patrol alone -- in December after completing the requisite 1,064 hours of training, Whitmore said. Burkhart's arrest came during Lalezary's fourth solo patrol shift. ""I think the beautiful thing about our program is it mirrors the full-time program exactly,"" Lalezary told reporters. While the training is held at different times, ""everything we do is the same."" ""When reserve deputies are out on patrol, the public doesn't know whether it's a reserve deputy or a full-time deputy,"" he said. ""It makes no difference and rightfully so. The training doesn't make any difference either."" In many instances, the reservists are unsung heroes because of their assistance in cases that aren't as high profile, Hansen said. The search and rescue teams, for instance, ""do some fabulous work, and they rescue people on a regular basis,"" he said. ""The public just knows it's the sheriff's department. ... They're involved in some very dangerous and technically demanding rescue work in the mountains."" About a month ago, a reserve team helped local authorities recover the bodies of people who had died in a mining accident, he said. Lalezary is ""very humble,"" Hansen said. ""He knows ... that there's another 843 folks that are doing very similar work and doing great things. ... In terms of the danger or the dedication and work ethic and everything else, there's a lot of other people doing the same thing on a daily basis.""","A reserve deputy arrests arson suspect in a series of Los Angeles fires .

(MNN.com) -- If you have a pet, you know that squeezing a topical solution on your dog each month may be the easiest and most effective way to fight fleas. Most of the products contain a synthetic insecticide that attacks a flea's nervous system. The solution is applied along a dog's back and usually spreads from follicle to follicle within a day. But this popular method has come under fire recently due to reports of adverse reactions among dogs and cats. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called for more stringent testing and evaluation requirements as well as stronger warning labels.

"London (CNN) -- New York and London remain the world's wealthiest spots -- but Asia and Latin America are catching up, a new report by Knight Frank shows. The bright lights of New York and London will lure the world's wealthy until at least 2023, the report shows, but Asia and Latin America will spawn the highest number of ultra-rich individuals over the next decade. According to The Wealth Report 2013, released March 6, the world's wealthy will grow by 50%. READ MORE: Asia's most innovative cities . The total number of super-rich -- defined as those with $30 million or more in assets -- grew by almost 5% in 2012 and another 95,000 individuals are set to break that barrier in the next 10 years, it said. Jakarta and Bali recorded the highest growth of luxury property across an index of 80 destinations. The principality of Monaco remains the most expensive location for prime real estate. A home on the French Riviera resort can cost up to $5,920 per square foot. Key Chinese cities such as Guangzhou and Shanghai have also seen a marked increase in property prices with Hong Kong real estate rising by 8.7% following an influx of wealth from mainland China.

"(CNN) -- Last Monday the cheers and celebration of crowds lining Boylston Street for the Boston Marathon were overwhelmed by the blasts of two bombs. Today, at the moment the bombs went off, silence. A line of Boston police officers extended out across Boylston Street. A horseshoe-shaped group of first responders surrounded the site of one blast. Hundreds of people gathered at nearby intersections. Some wept. Union laborers stood beside police and other Boston residents, their heads bowed, as the city sat eerily quiet until a harp's song sliced the silence. After that, all that could be heard was the whoosh of the wind. ""It's a new thing people are going to have to keep in their hearts now,"" said local student and Somerville resident Michael Sadler, who joined hundreds gathered at the corner of Hereford and Bolyston streets. ""There's just a lot of memories on those blocks. But a lot of it doesn't make sense."" The rest of the country paid its respects. The New York Stock Exchange went silent as well. So did the president and the U.S. Senate. But Boston has not been silenced by the tragedy. Signs calling for the city to ""stay strong"" were scattered throughout the area, as were hundreds of flowers and stuffed animals sporting Red Sox and Bruins T-shirts. A few American flags were attached to the wall of a bank. Outside the six-block zone barricaded by authorities, it was business -- and living -- as usual. People shopped at Prudential Center, strolled through the Back Bay, took the T to Downtown Crossing. The Red Sox are playing at Fenway Park Monday night. Though the grand Boston Public Library, not far away, remained closed, it is scheduled to open Tuesday. The Hub of the Universe does not give up. Last week was a shock to the system. How could it be otherwise? The sound of the explosions ""was so strong the bar filled up with smoke and chairs tipped over,"" one witness told CNN. ""I saw people -- it was like they were on a trampoline literally flying through the air."" Mark Gordon recently moved to a high-rise apartment on Boylston Street and had a perfect view of the marathon from his balcony. It was a glorious day in Boston, the city he'd lived in for 12 years. He was doing household chores when the first bomb went off. ""I'll never look out my window the same way again even though it's been six short days,"" Gordon said. The Marathon is usually a 26.2-mile party -- ""the old, drunk uncle of Boston sports, the last of the true festival events,"" Massachusetts native and Boston-area resident Charles P. Pierce wrote on Grantland. It used to offer a bowl of beef stew to the winner. More than 100 years into its existence, it remains a celebration of humanity, its route lined with the whole spectrum of life, from little kids to old-timers, coming out to enjoy a sure sign of spring. ""It's going to be a lot different next year,"" said Karen Russell, a Cambridge resident who works in Boston. ""They'll probably have a lot more security. But it'll all be different."" The flowers blooming this year are out for a different reason. But, as the Twitter hashtag had it, #BostonStrong. ""Boston is a tough & resilient town,"" said one sign near Boylston Street.

"London (CNN) -- The election of Jorge Bergoglio as Pope Francis, head of the Catholic Church and spiritual leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, has dominated CNN.com's coverage over the past 24 hours. You can read all about the first Latin American pope here. But while all eyes were on the Vatican, watching for the white smoke that signalled the announcement, there was plenty going on elsewhere. Here are five stories you may have missed while you were getting to know the new pontiff. 1. Xi Jinping was formally named as China's new president, as part of the country's once-in-a-decade leadership change. Xi, who took over as General Secretary of the Communist Party four months ago, replaces outgoing president Hu Jintao. Xi's new role was rubber-stamped in a vote by 3,000 deputies at the National People's Congress. China's premier, Wen Jiabao, is also stepping down as part of the leadership overhaul; he will be replaced by Li Keqiang. 2. Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu formed a new government following weeks of negotiations. Netanyahu and his conservative Likud Beitenu Party forged a coalition deal with centrists and ultra-conservatives, which excludes ultra-religious parties. The ultra-orthodox Shas Party will join the Labor Party on the opposition benches of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, while former opposition leader and government minister Tzipi Livni makes a return to government, as the coalition's Justice Minister. 3. Plans to embalm the body of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and put it on public display like Lenin and Mao Zedong appear to have hit a snag, with acting president Nicolas Maduro admitting the process might be ""quite difficult."" Maduro reported that scientists had said ""the decision should have been taken much earlier,"" though it is not clear why. He insisted, though, that Chavez, who died earlier this month after a battle with cancer, would always remain in the country's collective memory. 4. One of the leaders of Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge died while on trial for war crimes at a U.N. tribunal. Ieng Sary, who served as foreign minister of the regime, was the brother-in-law of infamous dictator Pol Pot. Ieng Sary's passing, at the age of 87, leaves just two defendants facing judgment by the tribunal investigating the actions of the Khmer Rouge, which terrorized Cambodia in the 1970s, killing more than one million people. 5. The bloated carcasses of 6,000 pigs were found in China's Huangpu River, sparking health fears over contamination, after traces of porcine circovirus were found in a water sample. Sanitation workers, clad in masks and plastic suits, were called in to fish the bodies from the river, as Chinese state media reported that a farm had admitted dumping the dead pigs.","Xi Jinping formally named as China's new president as part of once-in-a-decade change .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 20 people were killed and more than 35 others wounded when a suicide car bomber followed by gunmen in police uniforms attacked the police headquarters in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Sunday, city police said. The Interior Ministry in Baghdad placed the casualty count higher: 30 dead and 70 wounded. In the immediate chaotic aftermath of the attack, exact figures were difficult to come by. Oil-rich Kirkuk, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Baghdad, has been the scene of tensions recently. It is also one of the disputed areas in the country between the central government and Kurdistan regional government. The United States and the U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq condemned Sunday's attack. Martin Kobler, the U.N. special representative for Iraq, said the bombers ""show a complete disregard for human life."" ""It is important that the people of Kirkuk remain united against the forces of extremism and hatred,"" Kobler said in a statement issued by UNAMI. ""I urge the Iraqi leadership to take all necessary steps that are required to deal with this alarming situation, particularly in Kirkuk, the symbol of peaceful coexistence in Iraq."" A series of bombings in January killed dozens and left more than 100 wounded in Kirkuk. The attacks seemed targeted at Kurdish government officials. The Iraqi central government and the Kurdistan regional government have been at odds for years over who has final authority over Iraq's vast oil wealth. At the end of last year, relations between Prime Minister Nuri al-Malik's government and the Iraqi Kurds seemed to deteriorate further. In November, Iraqi Kurdistan deployed troops and tanks to cement the Kurds' claim over the strategic city. This launched a tense standoff with units of the Iraqi army, which had been deployed to areas near Kirkuk.","NEW: The United States and United Nations condemn the bombings .

"(CNN) -- Britain, Italy and Greece on Sunday confirmed that hostages from their countries were among seven construction workers reported killed in Nigeria over the weekend. ""This was an act of cold-blooded murder, which I condemn in the strongest terms,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement announcing that a British construction worker was among the dead. Nigerian militant group Ansar al-Muslimeen claimed responsibility for the February kidnappings of the seven construction workers from an office in northeastern Nigeria. The group, widely known as Ansaru, released images of some of the bodies Saturday. Italy's Foreign Ministry said Sunday that it appeared the report of the deaths ""is founded."" Greece said one of its citizens was among the dead, and that his captors ""at no stage either communicated or expressed demands for the release of the hostages."" Ansaru blamed the deaths on a joint Nigerian-British military operation intended to free the hostages. Without directly addressing the claim, Hague said, ""Responsibility for this tragic outcome rests squarely with the terrorists."" ""I am grateful to the Nigerian Government for their unstinting help and cooperation,"" he said. ""We are utterly determined to work with them to hold the perpetrators of this heinous act to account, and to combat the terrorism which so blights the lives of people in Northern Nigeria and in the wider region."" Some of the other hostages were from Lebanon, which had not commented on the reports Sunday. All seven hostages were seized from an office of Lebanese-based construction firm Setraco in northeastern Nigeria on February 18. In claiming responsibility for the attack, Ansaru said it taken them captive because of ""transgression and atrocities"" against Islam in Afghanistan, Mali and other locations. Setraco's Nigerian subsidiary is involved in many major road construction projects in northern Nigeria. U.S. officials say Ansaru is an offshoot of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which Nigerian authorities say is behind a recent rash of killings and kidnappings in the country. Boko Haram -- whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege"" -- has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria, according to Human Rights Watch. Ansaru has previously claimed responsibility for the December kidnapping of a French citizen near the border with Niger and for an attack on a prison in Abuja in November.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government is the largest financial entity in the world. Nothing else comes close. On Sunday, April 29, it will be exactly three years since the U.S. Senate passed a budget. If you own or work for a small business that has a loan from a bank, I'm quite sure your business has a budget -- and a rather detailed budget at that. Every year around tax time, many American families sit down to fill out tax forms, estimate their income, and set spending priorities for the upcoming year. It's the responsible thing to do. And yet, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid appears to believe it is not necessary for the Senate to fulfill its legal responsibility by debating and passing a budget to account for $3.8 trillion in federal spending next fiscal year, $15.6 trillion of debt and, according to figures produced by the Senate Budget Committee Republican staff, more than $65 trillion in additional unfunded liabilities. To provide some perspective to these incomprehensible numbers, the total net private asset base -- that is, the net value of all household assets, small business assets, and large business assets -- of the United States is $82 trillion, according to figures from the Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Account from March 8, 2012. Even worse, President Barack Obama and his administration seem to view budgeting as just one more political maneuver. His efforts have been so completely unserious that the President's 2012 budget was rejected by a vote of 97-0 in the Senate. And three weeks ago, when Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-South Carolina, sponsored a budget proposal based on Obama's 2013 budget plan, it lost in the House by a vote of 414-0. That's right, not a single member of Congress cast a vote in favor of Obama's last two budgets. That is a stunning repudiation of his leadership. What it really represents is a total abdication of leadership. Democrats in the Senate have all the votes they need to pass a real budget and show the American people their plan for today and the future. But they refuse, because they don't want to be held accountable. They would rather cut backroom deals that hide the details of their plans, and then take political pot shots at Republicans who have had the courage to produce and vote for a serious budget. Democrats claim that last year's Budget Control Act is an adequate substitute for a real budget because it ""deems"" spending caps. Obviously, it is not. It is only half the equation. It includes no plan for saving Social Security or Medicare, for reforming taxes, or for ever living within our means. But it does prove that Washington is certainly good at making sure spending continues. Business owners and consumers all over America are watching Washington, shaking their heads in disgust, and holding on to their wallets. These are the people we need to get our economy moving again, but these are the very people that are under assault by Obama and his policies. The Obama administration's agencies are regulating business to death, limiting the use of America's domestic energy resources, threatening to punish success by increasing tax burdens, and providing no credible plan for reining in our debt and deficit. As self-defeating as all of these policies have been, not having a credible long-term budget plan might prove to be the most harmful. For the 30 years from 1970 through 1999, the average borrowing cost of the U.S. government was 5.3%, according to an analysis made by my staff of figures from the Office of Management and Budget. During that period, the ratio of our debt to our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) averaged 47% and never exceeded 67%. We were a far more creditworthy nation back then than we are today. Now our debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 100%, and over the last three years, America's borrowing cost has been kept at an artificially low rate of 1.5%. How long can that last? Nobody knows. What we do know is that if our borrowing costs were to revert to the 1970-through-1999 average of 5.3%, America's annual interest expense would increase by $600 billion -- an amount that equals 50% of discretionary spending. Out of our $3.8 trillion annual budget, only $1.3 trillion is discretionary spending subject to appropriation and some level of control. Everything else, roughly $2.5 trillion, is mandatory and entitlement spending that is on automatic pilot -- with no requirement to ensure financial solvency of these programs. This is unsustainable. Increased interest expense resulting from higher rates, the true cost of Obamacare, and reduced revenues from slower economic growth caused by uncertainty and lack of confidence, all significantly raise the risk of dramatically higher debt and deficits. Employer surveys by McKinsey, as well as analysis by former Congressional Budget Office Director Holtz-Eakin, show that far more Americans will lose employer-provided care than CBO estimates. Additionally, Congress is unlikely to implement the hundreds of billions in Medicare cuts that are called for in the president's health care law .

"(CNN) -- Record-setting rains in parts of the Midwest have caused hundreds of flight cancellations and flooding, with one northern Illinois hospital evacuating patients due to rising floodwaters. Forty-four patients were removed Thursday from Morris Hospital in Morris, Illinois, due to the threat of rising floodwaters from the nearby Illinois River that had already soaked the two-story facility's ground floor, said hospital spokeswoman Janet Long. Of those, 27 were transferred to other hospitals and 17 ended up going home or back to their nursing homes. The evacuation was precautionary, Long said, adding that the hospital's emergency department will remain open Friday -- when the Illinois River is expected to crest around 7 a.m. Along the same river about 25 miles west in Ottawa, a voluntary evacuation order has been issued for residents in the eastern part of that city, said LaSalle County emergency management official Connie Brooks. Some 100 people have already left two mobile home parks 10 miles farther west in Utica, she added. Rising rivers are just one of the headaches tied to torrential rains in recent days. Back streets and highways have also been inundated by flash floods around Illinois, Indiana and elsewhere, while thousands of would-be air travelers have found themselves stranded. In one 24-hour span reported Thursday afternoon -- at a time when heavy rain was continuing to fall -- some spots in the Chicago metropolitan area had seen nearly 7 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. To put that in perspective, the city averages 3.38 inches of precipitation for the entire month of April. Wednesday was the sixth-wettest April day recorded at O'Hare International Airport. But that was just a taste: By 7 a.m., morning rain had already made Thursday the rainiest April day ever for Chicago. WGN: Sinkhole swallows three cars . By Thursday night, most flash flood warnings for the region had been canceled. But parts of seven states had flood warnings, some of which extend until next week, due to concerns about creeks and rivers overflowing their banks. The North Skunk River in Sigourney, Iowa, for example, was at 22.1 feet and rising at 7:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET) Thursday -- well above the flood stage of 16 feet. ""About half the town"" of London Mills -- which equates to about 200 people in the central Illinois community some 35 miles west of Peoria -- was evacuated Thursday as the Spoon River continues to rise well above flood stage, said the village's police Chief Scott Keithley. At least seven structures are flooded, and parts of Illinois Route 116 are underwater. ""This is the worst flooding I've seen,"" Keithley said. And in Chicago, the Chicago River set a record when it crested at 8.57 feet, smashing the record of 7.86 feet set in 2008, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The weather has also put a damper on many people's travel plans. Storm damages Oklahoma tire plant . The Chicago Department of Aviation reported at one point Thursday that more than 600 flights had been canceled. The situation had improved somewhat by night's end, though, at which time the Federal Aviation Administration -- for seemingly the first time in days -- wasn't reporting significant delays at the city's O'Hare Airport. American Airlines spokesman Matt Miller said severe weather is affecting its hubs not only in Chicago but also in Dallas/Fort Worth. American and American Eagle have canceled 413 flights on Thursday because of weather, he said. And Southwest Airlines spokesman Chris Mainz cited delays and cancellations because of weather in Chicago and storms in other parts of the Midwest.

"(CNN) -- Remember that messiness when Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien were battling it out on air? Or when Leno and David Letterman used to trade jabs during their monologues? Neither do we. These days the late-night focus is on the Jimmys: Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel. Fallon has managed to keep fans riveted with expectations over what musical guest might pop up next in a way that hasn't happened since Arsenio Hall left the air (admit it, you sang along when Mariah Carey did ""All I Want For Christmas"") and capitalized on the boyish charm that made him star of ""Weekend Update"" on ""Saturday Night Live."" Meanwhile Kimmel has been everywhere recently, from the cover of Rolling Stone to ruling the Web on Friday after his ""nemesis"" Matt Damon took over his show Thursday night in what turned out to be one seriously funny Kimmel roast. Thursday night's temporarily renamed show, ""Jimmy Kimmel Sucks,"" was the result of a long-time ""feud"" between Kimmel and the Academy Award winning Damon and helped pull in the viewers. It proved to be so successful that ABC has announced it will re-air the episode during prime time Tuesday night. According to a press release, the show resulted in Kimmel's highest ratings since his show moved to the 11:35 p.m. time slot this month. It ranked No.1 among late-night talk shows in both households and among the coveted 18-49 demographic, beating ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" by 62% and ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" by 120%. But don't expect Kimmel to rave about that fact on his official Twitter account, or anywhere else for that matter. During a recent appearance before a group of television critics, it was announced that Kimmel had beaten Letterman in the ratings. The Washington Post reported that when asked what it was like to ""kill Dave"" in the ratings, Kimmel was quick to retort ""I'm not killing Dave"" and point out that Letterman's ratings had not changed since Kimmel's show replaced ""Nightline"" in its time slot. That could be despite the fact that Letterman is his competition, Kimmel has a deep respect for the fellow funnyman. ""If I beat David Letterman in the ratings, does that mean I'm better than Letterman?"" Kimmel recently told Rolling Stone. ""No f***ing way."" The talk show host had less kind words for Leno, telling the publication, ""As a comedian, you can't not have disdain for what he's done: He totally sold out."" Ouch. So how is Kimmel ensuring that ABC's gamble to move his show from midnight to its new slot to make it more competitive will pay off? At this point, it seems just by being himself and continuing with what has led him to this point. Kimmel wasn't afraid to show his softer, fan side last Halloween when his hero Letterman appeared on his show. He showed his idol photos of his 18th birthday cake, which sported the ""Late Night With David Letterman"" logo. He charmed first lady Michelle Obama when she appeared on his show in October and won rave reviews last year when he hosted both the White House Correspondents Dinner and the Primetime Emmy Awards. Irma Zandl of the Zandl Group tracks trends and told E! that Kimmel is a bit of the late-night everyman. ""I have always considered Jimmy Kimmel the Gen Y version of Jay Leno,"" Zandl said. ""He has that Midwestern, down-to-earth humor that Leno represented without the Conan weirdness that has such limited appeal."" He also clearly doesn't mind being the butt of the joke as he was Thursday night as celeb friend after celeb friend (including ex-love Sarah Silverman) took shots at him. After all, this is a comic who dressed as a plumber with his crack showing for the cover of Rolling Stone. Top that, Leno and Letterman.","Jimmy Kimmel's Thursday night show won big ratings .

"(CNN) -- In the summer of 1985, I lived a dual life. In my scholarly work, I argued that traditional gender roles -- the stay-at-home mother, the bread-winning father -- were recent cultural constructs. Throughout human history, women engaged in productive labor alongside men. It wasn't until the Industrial Revolution that men began to work outside the home, tethering women to household responsibilities and child rearing. My thesis was that attitudes toward motherhood changed as the care of children became the exclusive responsibility of mothers. Modern motherhood is a cultural invention, I argued, not biological destiny. Opinion: Benefit of office face time a myth . When I wasn't writing academic papers, I was caring for my baby daughter, working hard to be her primary attachment figure. When she cried out in the night, I wanted her to call for Mommy, not Daddy. I recognized my desire was based on my gender, and I appreciated the irony of this. Nevertheless, I had internalized the values of my culture, and my own scholarship could not help me override this. I comforted myself that attitudes would change over time. After all, the women's movement was still relatively young, and I was mothering during the height of the Mommy Wars. Sadly, very little has changed. Why? Because the narrative in our culture is consistent and unyielding, reflected in the views of liberals and conservatives alike, omnipresent in our lives: Raising children is mothers' work, not parents' work. When Marissa Mayer, the CEO of Yahoo, banned employees from working from home, the media largely framed this as detrimental to women, not men. Mayer's decision was portrayed as limiting work-life flexibility for mothers, who may need to be at home -- or prefer to be at home -- with their children. Her decision was not sexist, but the coverage was. More than 40 years ago, psychologists Sandra and Daryl Bem invented a simple test to determine whether a statement was sexist: Could you exchange the word ""women"" for ""men"" and still have the sentence work? Try it with the most-read essay the Atlantic magazine has ever published, Anne-Marie Slaughter's article, ""Why Women Still Can't Have it All."" In sentence after sentence, Slaughter's piece fails the test. In fact, the title fails. Yet few have questioned why the piece wasn't headlined ""Why Parents Can't Have It All."" Simplify your life: Telecommuting isn't just for parents . Maternal employment continues to pose a threat to our strongly held belief about motherhood -- it is natural for mothers, not fathers, to have primary responsibility for raising children. By not challenging this recent cultural invention, we continue to lock young mothers into the same social binds that trapped me, even when I knew better. Today, we are bombarded with the message that raising children is solely a mother's job. When women are pregnant, people ask them, but not the fathers of their children, whether they plan to return to work. When couples shop for baby products, they discover packaging and advertisements featuring mothers with children, not fathers with children or couples with children. When they watch television programs, even ""Modern Family,"" they find stay-at-home mothers and employed fathers. Not very modern. Or perhaps it is modern, and that's the problem. The cost to women is great in lost opportunity. The cost to society is great in lost human capital. In the United States, women comprise only 20% of the U.S. Senate and 18% of the House of Representatives. Just 12 of the 50 largest school districts are led by women. There are only 21 women leading Fortune 500 companies, and according to a recent McKinsey survey, only 18% of women managers want to be CEO, compared with 36% of men. In this context, Sheryl Sandberg, the COO of Facebook, is ""encouraging mothers with careers to opt out of the parent-or-career woman binary and firmly choose both."" By encouraging women to ""lean in,"" some, such as Slaughter, say Sandberg is placing undue burden on individual women. Others argue that she is letting policymakers and cultural arbiters off the hook. People are focusing on the wrong issues. Sandberg is providing a powerful counter narrative of possibility that is all but missing in our culture. Where does the solution lie? I have spent much of my 31-year career as a scholar arguing for family-friendly policies like quality child care, parental leave, and flexible work hours. But if we view these policy changes as supporting maternal -- rather than parental -- employment, then roadblocks for women will remain. We understand sexism when it's explicit -- unequal pay for equal work -- but we haven't acknowledged gendered cultural biases surrounding parenthood. Our implicit biases limit the aspirations of men and women alike. The solution lies in recognizing the problem. Only then will we change our culture. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kathleen McCartney.","Kathleen McCartney believed modern motherhood is a cultural invention, not biological destiny .
As a mom in '80s, she was a primary caretaker, but thought cultural attitudes would change .
She says nothing changed; child care, flex time, baby leave are still considered women's issues .

"(CNN) -- Jack Klugman, best known as messy sports writer Oscar Madison in TV's ""The Odd Couple,"" died Monday at his California home, his son Adam said. He was 90. His lawyer, Larry Larson, said he died at his house in Northridge, just north of Los Angeles, with his wife by his side. Veteran actor William Shatner tweeted: ""Condolences go out to the family of Jack Klugman. An extraordinary and talented man. He will be missed."" Klugman, who won two Emmys for his role in the early 1970s sitcom, also starred in ""Quincy, M.E."" as medical examiner Dr. R. Quincy from 1976 to 1983. He told Larry King in 2001 that he played Madison on Broadway before the TV show debuted. ""So when (executive producer) Garry Marshall called me, I thought he'd seen me do it on Broadway and that's why he wanted me. He said, 'No, I never saw you.' I said, 'So why did you want me?' He said, 'Well, I saw you in 'Gypsy,' and Ethel Merman was singing to you, and she was spitting all over you.' "" Marshall continued, Klugman said: "" 'You know, that's a good actor, he's not showing that she's spitting all over him.' That's why he hired me."" The show, based on a Neil Simon play, was the hilarious story of two recently divorced men who became mismatched roommates. Madison was the gruff, wisecracking slob. Felix Unger, played by the late Tony Randall, was the neurotic neat freak who was a professional photographer. But while the characters were always at odds with each other, the actors got along famously. When asked by King if he had a natural simpatico with Randall, Klugman said: ""Oh, yeah, it happened so beautifully."" He said the two made up a lot of the script on the spot. ""He would provoke you into saying something funny. That's true improvisation,"" he told King. ""It was wonderful. I had a great time. I learned a lot."" Randall, who died in 2004, was succinct. ""It just clicked,"" he told King. According to Klugman, the show, which made its debut in 1970, was on the verge of being canceled every year until it actually was axed in 1975. The show lives on in syndication, just as Klugman told Randall it would. ""You see, when were on originally, we never had a rating."" Randall told King in 1996. ""We were not a success. It's hard to believe, but Jack always said, 'Someday, we'll come back in reruns, and they'll find us because we know we were good,' and he just was right dead center on target."" That paid off nicely for the actors, who received part ownership; Klugman said he received 10% while Randall got 20%. It earned Klugman far more than the $7,000 an episode he made for the last season of 22 episodes. Klugman and Randall later reunited for a 1993 TV movie ""The Odd Couple: Together Again"" and the 1999 Broadway play, ""Sunshine Boys,"" according to the Internet Movie Database website. They also performed the stage version of ""The Odd Couple"" in London. When ""The Odd Couple"" ended, he didn't want to do another TV series, Klugman told King, even though he got a lot of offers for more comedies. He said he eventually became fascinated with the lead character in ""Quincy."" ""This guy is two heroes in one. He is a cop, he is a doctor,"" he said he told his agent. The show was successful because even though it was about death, it lacked violence. It was about social issues, he said. Klugman also won an Emmy in 1964 for outstanding single performance by an actor in a leading role for portraying a blacklisted actor in an episode of ""The Defenders."" Klugman's stage, film and television acting career spanned more than five decades. One of his first breaks was as a 29-year-old understudy in the comedic play ""Mister Roberts,"" starring Henry Fonda. Klugman spent 15 months on the road and played the role of a doctor for two months. The doctor was supposed to be about 40 years old. ""I always looked old anyway. When I was 22, I looked 80,"" Klugman said. A Philadelphia native, Klugman also made his mark in movies, including an early role as a member of the jury in 1957's ""12 Angry Men,"" and as Ali McGraw's father in ""Goodbye, Columbus"" in 1969. He was the last of the 12 actors from ""12 Angry Men"" to pass away. His earliest acting was on the stage in New York, where he continued to perform throughout his life. Some of his memorable early TV appearances included roles on ""The Twilight Zone"" and the crime drama ""Naked City."" The Internet Movie Database lists 97 television and film credits for Klugman. A battle with throat cancer in the late 1980s reduced his voice to a rasp, but it did not end his career. Klugman was also a big fan of the ponies. ""I always was a player,"" he said. ""I had been gambling on horses since I was a kid, 15 years old. And when I came (to Los Angeles), I came involved with people"" with whom he began to buy horses. One of the race horses turned up lame so Klugman agreed to breed the horse and sell the foal. Instead he decided to keep it and name it Jack. But when it was born, he was told the horse was a female so he named it Jacklin. When he received the horse, it turned out it was a male after all. Jacklin Klugman finished third in the 1980 Kentucky Derby and fourth in the Preakness Stakes. Klugman was first married to the late Brett Somers -- an actress and regular panelist on the TV quiz show ""Match Game"" -- from 1953 until her death in 2007, the website said. People magazine reported that the two separated in 1974 but never divorced. At the time of his death, he was married to former actress and longtime girlfriend Peggy Crosby, whom he married in 2008 when he was 85. Klugman is also survived by another son, David.

"(CNN) -- NBC might be aiming to replace Jay Leno with Jimmy Fallon, but it looks like the ""Tonight Show"" host isn't going down without a fight. Leno aimed one of his opening monologue jokes toward his employer Wednesday, the same day that reports proclaimed NBC is hoping to move Fallon to ""Tonight"" by the fall of 2014. In doing so, ""The Tonight Show"" would also move back to New York from California. In light of all that chatter, Leno took the stage as the still-current host of ""Tonight"" and cracked wise about NBC's sagging ratings. ""Scientists say they're getting closer and closer to being able to do 'Jurassic Park'-style cloning on extinct species -- things once thought to be extinct could now be brought back from the dead,"" Leno said. ""So, there's hope for NBC. It could turn around."" But if you've been tuning in -- and it's fair to assume that you might have, since ""Tonight"" is still one of the shows that is performing well for NBC, noted New York magazine's Vulture -- you know that Leno's been taking fire at the ""peacock"" network all week. On Monday, he compared NBC execs to snakes in a holiday-themed St. Patrick's Day joke. ""You know the whole legend of St. Patrick, right?"" Leno said. ""St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland, and then they came into the United States and became NBC executives."" And then on Tuesday, it was another light dig at NBC's poor performance. ""Did you hear about this? A 28-year-old woman from Serbia has a rare brain condition where she sees everything upside down,"" Leno said. ""Isn't that unbelievable? She sees everything upside down. In fact, she thinks NBC is at the top of the ratings."" Fallon also couldn't escape the reports Wednesday, and acknowledged them right off the top of his ""Late Night"" monologue. ""Before we get started, I have to talk about the rumors that came out today which say that I'll be moving up to 11:30 -- or as my parents call it, 'eh, it's still too late,'"" he joked. ""The rumors are true -- NBC is turning 'The Tonight Show' into a diving competition."" (ABC's ""Splash,"" you might've heard, premiered to nearly 9 million viewers on Tuesday.) Yet according to The New York Times' Bill Carter, Fallon's future as the new host of ""Tonight"" isn't a done deal as much as it's an understanding. ""There's no deal yet for the timetable of this, they have an understanding,"" Carter told CNN's Jake Tapper Wednesday. ""I'm sure Jay knows about the understanding. But Jay has a contract that goes until the fall of next year. I think from Jay's point of view, he will work until they tell him to stop. That's the way he is; that's the kind of guy he is."" Still, the idea of Fallon getting the show isn't a surprise -- at least, not as much as the report that the show will move back to New York from California. ""There's a lot of reasons for it -- I think they all feel that the energy of New York helps Fallon,"" Carter said. ""But also you have Lorne Michaels, who's the producer of the show, and has always been close to Jimmy and he's of course New York-based. And then you have the band, The Roots, and The Roots are a Philadelphia-based band, and some of the guys I think still commute to New York, and they're very important to that show and I don't think they wanted to lose them.""","Reports about Jimmy Fallon taking over ""Tonight"" prompted late night jokes .

"(CNN) -- It was supposed to be the start of motorsport's elite competition for 2013, but the stars of Formula One were left skidding about the rain-lashed Melbourne track like novice drivers. Saturday's qualifying was curtailed after the opening session, meaning the other two will now be held just a few hours ahead of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. The last time qualifying has been so badly affected was at Suzuka in Japan in 2010, when all three sessions were moved to Sunday. ""For us drivers, it means we have to build ourselves up for the challenge of qualifying again and again -- a bit like asking Usain Bolt to get ready for five 100-meter sprints one after the other and aborting four of them,"" said McLaren's Jenson Button, who won at Albert Park last year. ""That level of disruption creates quite a lot of mental and psychological stress for any athlete, but it was even worse for the fans, who'd been waiting excitedly for qualifying all day long and who then had to sit in the pouring rain with no on-track action to entertain them."" Explore Melbourne circuit with CNN's F1 interactive . There were still plenty of incidents as Felipe Massa spun and hit a wall, losing a front wing from his Ferrari. A similar fate befell Caterham rookie Giedo van der Garde, his teammate Charles Pic and Sauber's newcomer Esteban Gutierrez, who went over a curb with his rear wheel. The Mexican missed out on the second stage of qualifying along with the Caterham duo, Marussia rookies Jules Bianchi and Max Chilton, plus Pastor Maldonado-- a race winner last year -- who also went off-road and later described his Williams as ""undriveable."" Mercedes' Nico Rosberg set the quickest time of one minute 43.380 seconds -- a second slower than triple world champion Sebastian Vettel's fastest efforts from Friday practice as none of the drivers had the chance to use Pirelli's new supersoft compound tires due to the wet conditions. Rosberg's new teammate Lewis Hamilton was back in 10th, as the 2008 world champion managed to complete the session despite hitting a barrier -- extricating himself from the grass as he tentatively reversed back onto the track. Last season's championship runnerup Fernando Alonso was second fastest for Ferrari. ""It's a shame that qualifying has been put back,"" the two-time world champion said, ""but it was the right decision given the track conditions, especially as the white lines were really too slippery."" Massa was happy to finish sixth, ahead of Vettel and Button but behind Red Bull's Mark Webber, fourth-placed Sergio Perez of McLaren and third-placed Romain Grosjean of Lotus. ""In my whole career, I've never managed to get back on track after such a heavy impact and I'm really happy to still be in the hunt for qualifying,"" the Brazilian said. ""Other drivers were in similarly risky positions, so I fully approve of the decision taken by the stewards. In the dry, we are up there with the best, now we must sort out fixing the damaged parts."" Grosjean's teammate Kimi Raikkonen, third overall last season, was back in 11th ahead of Force India's Paul di Resta -- who like veteran Australian Webber also went off the track and into the grass verge. ""It wasn't easy with the traffic, people going off and the yellow flags but we went through to the second qualifying session tomorrow so it's not all bad,"" said 2007 world champion Raikkonen.","Only one of three qualifying sessions possible in Melbourne on Saturday .

"Washington (CNN) -- After weeks of military analysts examining the latest North Korean rocket before and after its failed launch, the focus now has turned to a truck. It's not just any truck. It's known as a ""transporter, erector, launcher,"" TEL for short, and is designed to move a long-range missile into place, stand it upright and launch it from just about anywhere in North Korea. The truck was spotted in a military parade in Pyongyang last weekend with what experts say is a new long-range rocket on board. The United Nations is investigating if the TEL came from China in violation of U.N. resolutions, a U.S. official tells CNN. The U.N. Security Council committee that monitors implementation of the sanctions on North Korea is investigating, the official said. The investigation was first reported by Jane's Defense Weekly. Asked about the TEL during a hearing Thursday of the House Armed Services committee, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said, ""I'm sure there's been some help coming from China. I don't know, you know, the exact extent of that."" Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies agrees. ""There is no question that there is a long history in the past of Chinese and North Korea cooperation on missile technology."" But he cautioned that ""until you can absolutely confirm that the system was made in China and is a violation of the missile technology regime, that does not mean that because something came out of China it's a violation of any of China's agreements."" Charles Vick, a missile analyst for GlobalSecurity.org, points out the truck may not have been made in China. ""It may be an offshoot derivation that the Koreans built themselves, but basically it's the same design,"" he said. Or China may have sold the truck to North Korea in the years before the sanctions were in place. ""That is not clear, how it arrived there, but it's a commercially available tractor truck,"" Vick said. As for the rocket/missile the truck was carrying. Few experts are willing to say what was seen in the parade was real, ""I think you create parade missiles for public display that don't have all the external equipment that's on them versus the real flight vehicles.""

"(Mashable) -- Rumors of a Facebook bug has users from all over the world worried about private messages showing up very publicly on Timeline pages. But the social network is debunking those claims, saying these messages are actually just older wall posts. A series of reports coming out of France â€” including ones from Metro France and Le Nouvel Observateur â€” claim that Facebook members who sent private messages over the past few years have been popping up on public posts. Some members in the U.S. have said their private messages from 2007 and 2008 are showing up on their Timeline, but Facebook told Mashable that the company hasn't found a bug and believes the discrepancy comes from a wider roll out of the newer Timeline layout on a global scale. Facebook says that if you can comment or Like that activity, then it is a wall post and not a private message. In the past, users weren't able to comment and Like posts, so Facebook believes members new to Timeline are confusing old posts for private messages. SEE ALSO: 50% of Consumers Value a Brand's Facebook Page More Than Its Website [INFOGRAPHIC] . ""A small number of users raised concerns after what they mistakenly believed to be private messages appeared on their Timeline,"" Fred Wolens of Facebook Policy Communications said in a statement. ""Our engineers investigated these reports and found that the messages were older wall posts that had always been visible on the users' profile pages. Facebook is satisfied that there has been no breach of user privacy."" UPDATE: When asked if such a bug were possible, Wolens responded: ""While not quite a technical impossibility, these systems are run on two separate backends which would require a non-trivial amount of work for this bug to be real."" We have been unable to confirm any case where private information has been leaked. For those worried that they may be subject to a bug, users can set all wall posts to only friends or just to themselves, and also hide the activity. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"Frankfurt, Germany (CNN) -- Serving Germany's financial capital, Frankfurt Airport is one of the world's busiest international gateways. With 56 million passengers passing through last year, it's the third busiest airport in Europe and claims to serve more international destinations than any other airport in the world. But rather than just catering to holiday makers, Frankfurt is a major logistical hub. Most of its passengers are business travelers and more than half of all passengers are there to transfer between flights. It handles more than 2 million tons of cargo each year, as well as 100 million animals. And more than 18,000 items of baggage travel along its 73 kilometers of conveyor belts every hour. See also: Record-breaking airports . ""What is unique about Frankfurt is the amount of traffic,"" Klaus Wehle, supervisor at Frankfurt control tower, told CNN's Becky Anderson. He added: ""We have four runways, we have two terminals, divided in different parts, so we have a lot of taxiing aircraft, which is very complex. ""Frankfurt is a transfer hub so we have several peak hours a day -- inbound peaks, outbound peaks -- so punctuality is a big issue here."" The airport was also considered the first to have infrastructure compatible with the colossal Airbus A380 -- the biggest passenger aircraft flying today. It can take up to 50 people to handle the turnaround of an A380 and the double-deck plane presents considerable challenges for the airport's staff. It takes about an hour to refuel an A380, which can guzzle up to about 320,000 liters of fuel -- enough to fill the tanks of some 6,000 cars. And a single A380 can require up to 1,200 in-flight meals -- prepped and cooked by the airport's chefs. Feeding Frankfurt Airport and its airlines is no small task. International chefs work around the clock to dish out an average of 100,000 meals a day -- enough to feed the population of a small city. While most meals for economy class are deep frozen, for business and first-class passengers food is freshly prepared on the day. But preparing food for consumption in the air presents unique problems -- not least that passengers' taste buds don't function as well at altitude. Maik Herodek, section manager of LSG Skychefs, a catering company at Frankfurt Airport, says its hard to create plane food that isn't plain. ""The challenge is to make good food ... because if you fly the air is dry, and you can't taste the salt,"" he said. ""So you have to work with more herbs or other spices."" And his secret to pleasing fussy airline passengers? ""All the ingredients are very fresh,"" he said. ""We check the temperature, we check the freshness, we check everything because it must be the freshest you get, because on the airplane, you can't say 'oh sorry, tell the chef I want another one.' There's just one chance to deliver good food on a plane.""","The Gateway goes behind the scenes at Frankfurt Airport .

"(CNN) -- Every Friday, Bree Boyce dreaded her high school gym class. Students had to run a mile under 11 minutes, and those who couldn't finish in time would have to walk around the track for the rest of the period. Weighing 234 pounds, Boyce never made it in time. ""There were a few times I tried to run because I was so embarrassed and afraid of what other kids might say. After many failed attempts, I gave up hope,"" said Boyce. Every day, Boyce wore a baggy T-shirt and a pair of faded, size 18 jeans to school. She ducked and dodged anytime someone tried to take her picture. She deflected attention from her weight by cracking jokes. Five years later and 112 pounds lighter, Boyce is no longer the camera-shy girl hiding inside saggy, shapeless tees. She struts onstage in body-hugging evening gowns and swimsuits. She embraces the spotlight as the reigning Miss South Carolina. And she has been a guest co-host on ""The View,"" chatting openly about her weight. Bree Boyce: Applying weight-loss lessons to all of life . ""I had struggled for so many years with my weight,"" Boyce said. ""So many girls look to beauty queens because they want to be like them and look like them. But my thing is that we're all unique and we're all different and not one person is going to look like the next. And somebody might be a healthy size 6, and an unhealthy size 0."" When she makes public appearances, a tiara rests on her head and a sash drapes over her shoulder. She'll compete for the Miss America crown in January in Las Vegas. Her journey from obese teenager to beauty queen isn't just about shedding excess weight, or going from one extreme to another. ""It's more about setting a good example for the younger generation,"" Boyce said. ""If you have a dream, go for it. Don't let others' perceptions hold you back."" Growing up, Boyce was chubbier than her three older siblings. Although she ate about the same foods as they did, her metabolism seemed different. As the youngest of two girls and two boys, Boyce found support and acceptance in her family and community. ""She was the funny kid,"" said Tiffany Olson, Boyce's older sister. ""She had the best personality."" Her personality carried over to school, where she won over friends with her enthusiasm (she was president of the pep club), and impersonations of celebrities from Cher to Britney Spears. ""I tried to be very outgoing and tried to compensate my weight with my personality,"" Boyce said. When people at school talked about her or teased her, she'd try to be their friend. ""Sometimes I made fun of myself with them,"" Boyce said. ""It was all trying to cover up and not try to expose myself too much that I was hurting inside about my weight."" Diet tricks the pros tell their friends . Throughout her childhood, Boyce watched on the sidelines as her older sister competed in beauty pageants. She secretly hoped one day, she would compete. As a teen, Boyce tried several weight-loss gimmicks, low-carb and starvation diets. But she'd always slip back into her old habits because the hunger returned with such intensity. Boyce's health battle is not rare in her home state. In South Carolina, about 31% of the population is considered obese. ""I figured that this was the body I was going to live in, and there was nothing I could do about it,"" Boyce said. ""I was just so unhappy about the way I looked, but I still continued to eat unhealthy."" ""I would come home from school, sit on the couch for hours, and snack all day long. I would drive to a fast food place, pick up any meal I wanted to, eat it and then go back an hour later, eat it again."" At age 17, she went to the doctor's office because of knee problems. The doctor didn't mince his words. ""You know, this weight has to come off,"" he told her. ""And if it doesn't, then your body is not going to take care of you in the long run. And you're only 17 years old."" Boyce realized that he was right. ""I'm 17 years old. I have the whole world in front of me. And it's up to me and only me to change it. And that's exactly what I did,"" she said. Surgery is no quick fix for obese teens . She tossed out junk food and set a goal to lose five pounds in one month. And she put one foot in front of the other. She walked around the block because ""that's all I could do. I was so overweight."" Then the next week, she walked a little farther. After her first month, she lost seven pounds. When you're losing weight, where does the fat go? After losing more pounds, she joined the gym, started dancing in Zumba classes. Then she started jogging. During her senior year of high school, an adviser at the pep club suggested Boyce try for the title of Miss West Florence, the school's equivalent of a beauty pageant. At first, Boyce laughed it off. ""I was not thin,"" she said. ""I was still chubby, losing weight gradually."" But Boyce gave it a shot. ""I was myself and I won,"" beating 38 other girls, she said. ""That gave me another confidence boost knowing that I could do what I set my mind to."" After graduating in 2007, she went to study theater at Francis Marion University. She competed for the local Miss Florence title and began a winning streak in local beauty pageants until she finally won the state crown in July. Through the years, Boyce had to unlearn a lifetime of bad habits. ""It's all about learning a process, learning a lifestyle, and so many people think it's an overnight quick fix. And it absolutely is not. It takes time. It took me three years,"" she said. Boyce, who couldn't finish a mile in under 11 minutes in high school, can now run that distance in seven minutes. She plans to train for her first marathon once she has time after the Miss America contest. ""You don't have to be rail thin to think you're beautiful and want to be Miss America,"" she said. ""You need to be happy and content with yourself, get your physical activity. That's what counts the most -- not starvation diets and being rail thin."" Boyce meticulously schedules workouts and meals to prepare for Miss America. On a recent day, she cooked breakfast at home in Florence, scrambling eggs and slicing a grapefruit. ""I block out where am I going to eat, how am I going to eat that day,"" she said. In the pageant world, where a woman's frame and figure are constantly analyzed, Boyce has heard the critiques: too muscular, too big, not petite enough, not a size 00. Bree Boyce's Facebook page . ""I love my body,"" Boyce said. ""I went from 234 pounds to being comfortable and happy and being content with the way I look. Someone says I'm not a 00 -- that doesn't mean I don't continue to compete for Miss America. We need to give an idealistic role model."" She said she'd rather be on stage looking the way she does now than looking ""sick, frail and thin.

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- Travelers to China who display flu-like symptoms may be randomly quarantined over concerns of the swine flu virus, the U.S. State Department warned. A child traveling with his parents wears a face mask after they arrive at the Beijing, China, airport. There have been cases of children being separated from parents after either tested positive for the virus, also known as H1N1, a travel alert said Friday. Chinese officials may give medications to minors in such cases without consulting their parents, according to the alert. ""Although the proportion of arriving Americans being quarantined remains low, the random nature of the selection process increases the uncertainty surrounding travel to China,"" the alert said. Swine flu is a respiratory disease of pigs transmitted to humans and caused by type A influenza virus. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and coughing. There have been about 48,000 confirmed cases worldwide, including 519 in China, according to the World Health Organization. The Chinese government has taken measures to stop the spread of the virus. They include placing passengers who have fever or flu-like symptoms on a seven-day quarantine, the alert said. Others facing quarantine include those sitting close to travelers with symptoms, those with elevated temperatures and those from areas where virus outbreaks have occurred. A 15-year-old from Topeka, Kansas, told CNN on Monday that she was quarantined in Beijing for a week. ""Apparently, I was sitting too close to a man who had a fever on the 14-hour plane ride,"" Kaitlin Hannigan said, adding that she initially thought she had a fever, but her temperature was fine when officials checked it. A day after she arrived in Beijing with an educational group, government officials showed up at her hotel. ""They were wearing quarantine suits, goggles and masks and, like, full body suits and gloves, and said I had to be quarantined for seven days because I came in contact with that guy,"" Hannigan said. Earlier in June, New Orleans, Louisiana, Mayor Ray Nagin was quarantined in Shanghai after possible exposure to the virus. Nagin was headed to Australia on an economic development trip when he was quarantined for four days after sitting beside a passenger who was being treated for suspected swine flu symptoms. Nagin showed no signs of illness. State officials warned Americans traveling to China that they have to follow local quarantines procedures. ""The U.S. Embassy will be unable to influence the duration of stay in quarantine for affected travelers,"" the statement said. The travel alert expires in September.","Travelers to China with flu-like symptoms could face 7-day quarantine .

"(CNN) -- A drug that presents a new way to knock out cancer cells was approved Friday to treat patients with a certain type of late-stage metastatic breast cancer. The drug, referred to as T-DM1 during clinical research, will now be known by the brand name Kadcyla, the Food and Drug Administration said in its approval announcement. It's a new therapy for women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Kadcyla is a combination of the targeted drug trastuzumab -- better known by the brand name Herceptin -- and a powerful chemotherapy drug called DM1. It's designed to work when Herceptin alone can no longer keep cancer in check. DM1 is too toxic to deliver directly into a patient's bloodstream, like other chemotherapy drugs. The Herceptin part of the new drug homes in on cancer cells, sparing other healthy cells, and delivers DM1 into the cell. ""Kadcyla delivers the drug to the cancer site to shrink the tumor, slow disease progression and prolong survival,"" said Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a statement. The drug is the fourth approved to target the HER2 protein. Genentech, the company that developed the drug, is working to get it to patients ""imminently,"" said spokesman Susan Willson. ""As soon as humanly possible, but within two weeks at the outside."" Kadcyla will cost about $9,800 monthly, which Willson said is ""similar to the cost of other treatment regimens in this line of therapy."" The estimated cost of a course of Kadcyla -- 9Â½ months -- is about $94,000. But ""we want to ensure that people who are eligible for this medicine have access to it,"" Willson said. Genentech plans to initiate patient assistance programs for the drug to help those who might not be able to afford it; those without health insurance or those who have reached the lifetime limit set by their insurance companies may qualify to receive Kadcyla for free. Experimental drug offers new way to battle certain breast cancer . Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women, according to the National Cancer Institute and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HER2 is a protein involved in normal cell growth. It's found in increased amounts on some types of cancer cells. In HER2-positive breast cancers, the increased amount of the protein contributes to cancer call growth and survival. Nearly 20% of breast cancers have increased amounts of HER2. Researchers announced the results of a large three-year clinical trial of Kadcyla in June, saying they were optimistic about it. One significant benefit, according to lead study author Dr. Kimberly Blackwell of Duke University, is the lack of significant side effects and a better quality of life for patients on the drug. Patients participating in the trial, she said, were the first group for whom officials worried about fixing their hair for media interviews. It's important to note, however, that Kadcyla is not the same as Herceptin and could cause serious side effects including liver problems and heart problems such as congestive heart failure or even death. It also can cause life-threatening birth defects, meaning pregnant women should not take it. The FDA's approval of the drug comes with the requirement that the prescribing information comes with a boxed warning alerting patients about the possibility of these side effects. However, the potential risks may be acceptable to women who have no other options, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. Kadcyla, known as an ""antibody-drug conjugate,"" represents ""a completely new way"" to treat HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer, said Dr. Hal Barron, chief medical officer and head of global product development for Genentech. An antibody-drug conjugate is described by the company as ""a new kind of targeted medicine that can attach to certain types of cells and deliver chemotherapy directly to them."" ""We currently have more than 25 antibody-drug conjugates in our pipeline and hope this promising approach will help us deliver more medicines to fight other cancers in the future,"" Barron said in a statement. CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","The drug, Kadcyla, presents a new way to knock out cancer cells .

"(CNN) -- The makers of BlackBerry devices, Research in Motion, are gearing up for a fight they can't afford to lose. On Wednesday at a press event in New York, the company will finally unveil its new smartphone operating system, BlackBerry 10, and a pair of new handsets -- one with a physical keyboard and another that's all touchscreen. But are there enough BlackBerry fans left out there to embrace a new kind of smartphone from a company that has fallen woefully behind the competition, both in sales and innovation? Many BlackBerry users in the United States are stuck with the device because it is issued by their employer, which has led to a cumbersome trend of people carrying two devices: a work phone and a personal one. To succeed, RIM must persuade diehard BlackBerry fans to upgrade to something radically new. BlackBerry also must woo corporations by emphasizing security and support features while distinguishing itself from the leading smartphone platforms, iOS and Android, and the other new kid, Windows Phone 8. ""They need to get everything absolutely right, from the design of the hardware to the UI (user interface) of the hardware to the number of applications to the price of the applications,"" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner. Unlike Microsoft, which cut its teeth on Windows Phone 7 and sunk huge amounts of money into polishing and marketing Windows Phone 8, the troubled RIM needs its new platform to be a success the first time out. It has been a rough couple of years for the Canadian company. Unable to keep pace with the rich app store selections and slick design of iOS and Android devices, RIM has hemorrhaged users in the United States. The company's public image has suffered, as chunky BlackBerry phones became a popular target for mocking by the press and iPhone owners in coffee shops, bars and meeting rooms. A widespread network outage in 2011 didn't help. The financial impact was brutal. Over the course of a year, RIM's sales volume dropped 51%, according to the company's third quarter 2012 earnings, and in July, RIM announced plans to cut 5,000 jobs. Part of this plunge could be spun as customers waiting for the next generation of BlackBerry devices. The BlackBerry 10 platform was announced in May, along with plans to roll out products by the end of 2012. But the date was pushed back, and the company missed out on the lucrative holiday season and corporations' IT planning for 2013. ""The delay has not helped them. Corporations that have decided to move away from RIM already made that call for 2013."" said Milanesi, who believes corporations will be the key to RIM's survival. Real vs. virtual keyboards . It's a different world now than when the first waffle-shaped BlackBerry caught on in the early to mid-2000s. At the top of its game, the BlackBerry had cachet. Its users were workaholics, such as high-powered executives and members of Congress, and they were adept at composing full-length missives on the small keyboard with one hand while walking and talking. But in recent years a new trend has swept many of the large corporations that issued BlackBerrys. Now many employees bring in their desired devices, usually iPhones or high-end Android phones, from home and use them for work instead of taking what's doled out by the IT department. RIM recognizes that its core customers are highly regulated industries such as government and finance, which have struggled with mobile security issues. On Wednesday, the company released BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10, a device-management system for corporations and government agencies that can support company-issued devices as well as employees' personal smartphones. RIM also is promoting another feature, BlackBerry Balance, which sets up separate profiles for work and personal apps and data on a single device. The brand's traditional focus on IT-friendly support, security and e-mail productivity will likely still appeal to companies. But RIM also needs to liven up its line of phones with great apps and smart-looking hardware. RIM still has loyal fans outside IT departments, like speed typists hooked on the phones' physical keyboard. The BlackBerry was one of the first devices to combine e-mail and a mobile phone in a way that made it possible to do real work. For many BlackBerry users, that level of productivity was never quite matched by the next generation of touchscreen smartphones, kicked off by the iPhone in 2007. When the first iPhone debuted, a common criticism was that it couldn't be taken seriously as a work device because it didn't have a ""real"" keyboard. There was a sharp learning curve, and typing required getting used to the autocorrect features that were supposed to compensate for stray fingertips. Eventually the the new school of touchscreen smartphones won out, thanks to powerful features the BlackBerry couldn't touch, such as stocked app stores, stunning games and full Internet browsers. The features that appeal to the remaining BlackBerry fans are the ones that make the devices good for communicating quickly, like pounding out e-mails on the full QWERTY keyboard or using the BlackBerry Messenger service. ""RIM has always built a device you use 300 times a day for 10-20 seconds at a time. Their goal is to add seconds back into your day,"" said Kevin Michaluk, editor of CrackBerry.com, a site for BlackBerry fans. But a new phone that lacks the signature keyboard could be a hard sell for BlackBerry fans who have managed to resist the siren song of touchscreen devices. ""The difficulty is that the people who are left over are the people who are happy with what they have today,"" said Milanesi. What's coming at Wednesday's launch . RIM is expected to cover its bases by introducing two devices -- one joining the mainstream with an all-touchscreen display and another keeping the keyboard. The release dates for the new products haven't been announced, but Michaluk thinks RIM could make a touchscreen phone available first in an attempt to convert the curious keyboard faithful. The BlackBerry 10 operating system will still emphasize work productivity with a BlackBerry Hub feature that collects e-mail and other messages in one spot. A voice assistant will do its best Siri impersonation, and mobile payments will get a boost with built-in NFC. App selection is another key area that BlackBerry must address. BlackBerry App World, its online store, has about 100,000 apps, compared to more than 700,000 each for Android and Apple. Historically, the company has been known as an inhospitable place for small outside developers. But as part of its internal shakeup, RIM has drastically revamped its developer relations program. Led by Alec Saunders, the group has been actively courting developers ahead of next week's launch with tools that make it easy to port over Android apps and programs like Built for BlackBerry, which offer incentives for apps made for the BlackBerry 10 platform. RIM is extending the deadline for the Built for BlackBerry program after it says it received 19,000 submissions. Saunders has stated the company wants to have more apps at kickoff than the other smartphone platforms originally launched with. However, many big developers will likely wait to see the initial reaction to BlackBerry 10 before sinking money into creating apps for the new system. Developers might be more optimistic about RIM's international potential. In Europe, where the BlackBerry brand has faired slightly better over time than in the United States, carriers still offer extremely competitively priced data plans for the devices, giving the phones an edge with companies that have international business travelers, according to Milanesi. According to IDC, BlackBerry 10 is set to battle it out with Windows Phone 8 for the No. 3 smartphone operating system worldwide in 2013, behind Android and Apple's iOS. While its grip has slipped in North America, BlackBerry has maintained a strong presence in such far-flung places as Indonesia, Nigeria, South Africa, Mexico and some South American countries. Michaluk thinks that RIM's decision to delay its big BlackBerry 10 launch until after Windows Phone 8 debuted could yield unexpected advantages. ""Being the newest platform on the block, they can look at what everybody's doing, what's good and bad,"" said Michaluk. RIM will have to convince existing users that BlackBerry 10 and its new phones are worth sticking around for, but those last vestiges of BlackBerry's fan base probably won't be enough to keep the company afloat. The company also must lure back past BlackBerry users who have moved on to newer platforms, and present itself as a reinvigorated alternative to iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8. Even then, there's no guarantee it will work. Said Milanesi, ""They can still do everything right and not succeed because of how competitive the environment is out there.""","New BlackBerry 10 operating system being unveiled at RIM event Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Big day reveal or YouTube preview? That's the question marketers face as they decide when to release their much-anticipated Super Bowl commercials. Mashable recently reported ads that ran online before the Super Bowl received 9 million views, compared to 1.3 million views for ads that debuted during the big game. Generating buzz and going viral are two measures of success. In 2012, more than 13.7 million Super Bowl-related tweets were posted during the big game and this year that figure is expected to be higher. Last year, the top ad hashtags were #solongvampires, #makeitplatinum and #beckhamforhm. Does anyone remember what those were for? No matter. It's a new year! Here are some of the Super Bowl ads currently creating big buzz... Volkswagen ad - The Minnesota man with the Jamaican accent . Spreading happiness by channeling Jimmy Cliff is the theme of this Volkswagen commercial, which has generated some controversy. While some online discussions question whether the use of a Jamaican accent by a white guy from the ""Gopher State"" is offensive, commenters on the Volkswagen YouTube page say Jamaicans come in all colors. ""I think it's great, funny and a compliment to the Caribbean no worries feel happy way of life!"" wrote user rebelphoto. ""I myself am not Jamaican but work with a good friend who is and I just love the sound of his dialect and the way he spreads his happiness when we are demoralized, just like the guy in the ad. I love Marvin, anyone offended by this ad should watch it and listen closer."" The Jamaica Gleaner, a newspaper in Kingston, Jamaica, posed the question to their Facebook fans, who mostly agreed the ad was not racist. ""There is nothing wrong with this ad it's not racist,"" said Lascelles G. Johnson. ""How many Jamaicans speak like Americans?"" Watch the Volkswagen ad . Coca-Cola ad - Race across the desert . A Coca-Cola commercial featuring a race among outlaw cowboys, aggressive showgirls with glitter bombs and scavenging badlanders to reach a giant bottle of soda seems harmless enough. But it's the lone Arab character leading his camels through the desert who is overtaken by the race participants that has at least one Arab-American group asking for the character to be edited out. Warren David, president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee told Reuters on Wednesday the commercial is racist. A Coca-Cola spokeswoman said the characters are a nod to movies of the past. There hasn't been much reaction on Twitter. On Coke's YouTube page, Mona M. said, ""I'm Arab and I don't find this racist only because I don't allow myself or anyone to lower my people's standards. I'm smart enough to know that not every Arab is a Bedouin with a camel and not every American is a cowboy or show dancer.... Now can we worry about more important things in life already?!!!""

"(CNN) -- When the name of the game is escape, one gamer's boredom is another gamer's boon. Sony PlayStation 3 game Afrika's stunning graphics are virtually photo-realistic. On August 28, Sony released for PlayStation 3 in Japan its long-announced, shrouded-in-secret game ""Afrika,"" in which a single player assumes the role of a National Geographic photographer on an African safari to shoot wild animals in the grassland. Each of the player's photos is then judged on angle, target, distance and technique, and the photographer is rewarded in ""cash,"" which can be used to upgrade his or her camera to models based on Sony's latest Alpha-branded single-lens-reflex cameras and lenses. The game's graphics are effectively stunning, while sound effects include hooves treading lightly on the savanna, as giraffes and antelope walk slowly away once you've snapped that Sony moment. ""Sony is pushing the game's art style in a much more photo-realistic direction, which is a departure from most video games,"" says Ricardo Torres, editor in chief of GameSpot. ""Rather than create a stylized, fanciful world, Sony's Japanese development studio has pushed to create graphics that match the real world."" If this exotic, close-up-wildlife simulation is fascinating to some, others find it lacking in that little something. ""The game looks excellent, the animals look smart, throw in some guns and let's have some fun,"" comments CanadianCow on the Gaming Today Web site. Although players may encounter the occasional charging hippo, Afrika's human characters never die, and the emphasis is always on getting the best shot of the animals. But what may be new to Sony is hardly new to the rest of the gaming world, let alone to current industry leader Nintendo. Just over the past few years, the Japanese gamemaker has conquered a new generation of fans both young and old with innovative applications and its trademark Wii wand. Nintendo's own simulation games may offer comparatively lesser graphics, but they boast arguably better play. Released in April 2008, Wild Earth: African Safari allows up to three players to not only pursue photo-reporting missions but to ""play from the animal's perspective"" by flapping and thrusting their Wii remote. Just a few featured creatures include cheetah, crocodile, ostrich, frog, vulture, meerkat, tortoise, bat, warthog, wildebeest and hyrax. And for the Jacques Cousteau in everyone, Nintendo's Endless Ocean lets Wii divers leisurely explore the pristine waters of a fictional tropical island. With no time limit, point system or possibility of failure, the game even doubles as a screensaver if the remote is left untouched. Both Sony and Nintendo offer their own interactive fish tanks for more domesticated aquatic contemplation. Sony's Aquatopia, released in November 2007, was the first in a series of ""interactive art"" titles for the PlayStation Eye, which captures players' body movements. Nintendo's Wii-controlled My Aquarium, released less than a year later, not only lets you share or trade fish with friends via Wi-Fi, it also comes in a Fantasy edition that lets you ""unlock"" new fish -- as well as sharks, whales, dolphins and seals -- just as long as you don't mix predator and prey. ""Games that feature observation as a core component of their game play can be seen as more accessible to individuals who don't play games all the time,"" remarks Torres. ""Whereas seasoned game players will have no problem adjusting to more passive game play, you don't see that crossover the other way around."" Nintendo niche . James Whittle, video-games columnist for Hong Kong's South China Morning Post, agrees: ""It seems Sony is going after the green nature-loving crowd and gamers who like slower-paced games and animal-simulation games like Nintendo's dog and cat pet-caring sims, which pretty much created this whole new niche market."" The extremes of the gaming genres recall the classic contrast between Myst and Doom some 15 years ago. On one side of the spectrum, the misty island hiding secrets to be unlocked and alcoves to be explored; on the other end, the subjective view of the single-handed gun shooting to kill everything in sight for instant, unapologetic gratification. While mainstream media traditionally milks the latter's action-thrilling appeal, the former have always had their own loyal following. Even Pokemon Snap, released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64, was based on offering players a maximum of photo opportunities of Pikachu and friends. ""Video games started off as non-violent, and then later on the violent aspects came along,"" observes Whittle. ""Nobody reads news reports about the wonderful and pleasant gaming aspects of Hello Kitty Island Adventure or Barbie's Beach Vacation,"" said Whittle. And while Sony may think it's onto something new and trendy in the name of very good graphics -- it hopes to sell at least 100,000 copies of Afrika -- Whittle is more prone to call it game over for the PlayStation 3. ""The PS3 currently lacks the potential to draw in new buyers,"" he says. ""They are not putting out enough games for the console. Over the last summer they had a couple of months where only one or no games were released. With so many kids off for the summer they should have been like their competitors, coming out with a few games a week."" For many PlayStation 3 owners, at least in Hong Kong, the console is little more than a Blu-ray DVD player -- nonetheless, one clear advantage it has over its gaming competitors.  View gallery of game consoles » . But that's far from enough to help Sony's console sales catch up to Nintendo, who has sold 29.6 million Wiis worldwide in the past two years -- twice the number of PS3s -- while Microsoft has sold over 20 million Xbox 360s to date. Torres, however, is more optimistic about PS3 software: ""Sony's upcoming 2008 titles span a wide range of genres that have a broader appeal. Casual titles like Buzz and Singstar skew towards a broad audience, Resistance 2 is more for seasoned players, and unique new titles like Littlebigplanet have the potential to appeal to both seasoned and casual players."" Meanwhile, in terms of inspiring independent publishers to develop more challenging games that take full advantage of PlayStation 3's technological capabilities, only time will tell whether or not Afrika was the game that made the difference.","Sony releases PlayStation 3 game Afrika, simulating a photographer on safari .

"(CNN) -- For Leo Klink, the night was the payoff, the pinnacle, what you work most of your life for. It was the Hawaii state high school soccer championship, and Klink, a senior on the underdog Kalani Falcons, had state power Punahou in his sights. It was halftime, tied 1-1, thanks to Klink's chip shot over the Punahou keeper. In the stands on the night of February 9 were his proud parents, Paul and Hiroyo. ""We were having a blast,"" Paul Klink said later. ""It was halftime. We'd just seen Leo make a goal. It was the happiest moment of our life."" If the Falcons could pull this off and win their first state championship, it would be thanks largely to Hiroyo. She was the one who introduced Leo, Kalani's star and last year's ESPN high school player of the year in Hawaii, to the sport when he was just 7. She was the one who spent hour after hour with Leo, working on his game when he needed to catch up with the other boys. ""I wasn't that good at soccer,"" Leo said, explaining that his playing time was limited to three-minute spurts so the better players could catch a quick rest. So mom was there with support and encouragement. ""She helped me practice by myself at the park,"" Leo, 17, said. ""My mom taught me about resiliency. And how you would get nowhere without having a good work ethic."" About 10 minutes into the second half, the game stopped and an ambulance was rushed onto the field. Leo and his teammates waited out the 10- to 15-minute delay before the ambulance rushed off. Leo assumed it was a Punahou player who'd hurt his back earlier in the game. When he saw that player back on the field five minutes after the game resumed, he figured the paramedics had made a wasted trip. ""I thought the ambulance just came for nothing,"" Leo said. ""I thought the ambulance came and went to the hospital with no one in it."" Kalani coach Michael Ching knew differently. Hiroyo Klink was in that ambulance, and the last person she wanted to know that was Leo. In the stands, Paul Klink had looked at his 52-year-old wife and spotted trouble. ""She looked at me and she said, 'I feel a little bit dizzy,' and I noticed her left arm and her left leg were dragging. And I just looked at her and I said, 'Smile.' She looked at me like I was nuts. She tried to smile, but the left side of her face didn't move."" Paul Klink had just recently read about the signs of a stroke. He called 911, over Hiroyo's protests. ""She was just getting mad. 'Don't call an ambulance; don't stop the game.' I'm like, 'You can be mad at me and try to live. I'm going to call the 911,' and I did,"" Paul Klink said. But she was adamant that whatever was going on with her, Leo should stay on the field. ""It was the mom's wishes as soon as she went down, 'Do not tell Leo,' "" Ching said. What happens during a stroke . The game resumed, and Punahou soon took a 2-1 lead. ""As Kalani Falcons, we don't give up,"" Leo said later. ""We came back strong as usual."" When good things happen, Leo always says ""we."" ""He's the most unassuming star,"" says Aundrea Toner, one of Leo's longtime coaches. ""If you were to ask him who are the best three kids on the team, he wouldn't even name himself."" But that wasn't one of three other players streaking around the Punahou defense for the tying goal. It was Leo. And, after the game went to overtime, and then penalty kicks, to decide the Hawaii state champion, that was Leo blasting the ball into the upper right corner of the net on Kalani's final shot for the deciding margin. ""I was crying because I was so happy,"" Leo said. And then his coaches came over. ""I saw their faces and I knew something was wrong,"" Leo said. ""When coach told me about my mom then I just broke down with tears of sadness,"" Leo said. ""I was happy and then I just got really, really depressed."" ""It was tears of joy to utter heartbreak,"" Ching said. Hiroyo Klink wanted her son to enjoy all that comes with a state championship in Hawaii, the trophy, the medals, the leis that are heaped around the winners' necks. But when Leo Klink's name was called, he wasn't there. Things weren't looking good at the hospital, and Leo was rushed there. His mom was unconscious, but she'd gotten the news from the soccer field. ""The last thing she was told was that we won the state championship,"" Leo said. Two days later, Hiroyo Klink died. Before that, Leo said he got to have one last word with the mother who had gone to every game, who had cooked meals for him and his teammates, who had recorded videos of him and made highlight reels and posted them on YouTube. ""I wanted her last thought of me to be that I loved her, and that I would be a good boy, and that I know she's going to look over me and that we're going to meet again someday,"" he said. ""Somebody asked me once, 'What's the best sound in the world? What's the worst sound in the world?'"" Paul Klink, 48, said. ""The best sound in the world is Leo's laugh, but the absolute worst sound in the world is him crying over his mom when she's dying."" Leo Klink takes solace in the fact that his mom leaves behind something beyond her husband and son. She was an organ donor. ""She's going to save five people's lives,"" Leo said. ""And with her corneas people will see. It's her legacy."" Leo said he's going to do the same, that he will check the organ donor box on his driver's license. And he'd like to go to college to study nursing and hopes to play soccer. He knows that would mean a lot to his mom and those around him. ""He brings me to tears,"" Toner said. ""I know that he never asked to be a role model, but he is such an amazing role model."" Hiroyo Klink was the family's provider. Her husband has a congenital heart defect and is unable to work. Because her dream was for Leo to get a college education, friends have set up a fund to help that can be accessed at the Leo Klink Fund Facebook page.

"Kaufman County, Texas (CNN) -- Texas authorities are examining leads big and small, from skid marks made by large tires outside the home of a Kaufman County district attorney to bullets that took the lives of him and his wife. Four days after Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were discovered shot to death in their home, investigators were still trying to determine who targeted the couple. ""We haven't come close to charging anyone,"" a law enforcement official -- speaking on condition of anonymity -- told CNN on Wednesday. The official was not authorized to publicly release details of the investigation. Authorities have been tight-lipped about the investigation that has rocked the community east of Dallas, citing an ongoing investigation. This much is known: Investigators are working to determine whether there is a connection between the killings of the McLellands and the shooting death nearly two months earlier of the district attorney's chief felony prosecutor, Mark Hasse. The investigation the McLellands' killing is broad and nothing is being ruled out, according to a law enforcement official who was briefed on the progress of the case. The official was not authorized to publicly release details of the investigation. The McLellands were shot more than a dozen times, the official said. They also are looking at a white supremacist gang targeted by Texas and federal authorities last year, drug cartels and someone with a personal grudge against the slain prosecutors. White supremacists involved? The white supremacist angle gained traction in part because McLelland, in an interview with The Associated Press before his death, speculated that the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas could have been behind Hasse's slaying. ""We put some real dents in the Aryan Brotherhood around here in the past year,"" McLelland told the news agency. McLelland said he wasn't involved in the Aryan Brotherhood investigation, but his office was one of numerous Texas and federal agencies involved in a multiyear investigation that led to the indictment last year of 34 alleged members of the group -- including four of its senior leaders -- on racketeering charges. While authorities have not said whether they have linked white supremacists to the deaths, Texas law enforcement agencies did warn shortly after the November 2012 indictment that there was ""credible information"" the group was planning to retaliate. Gov. Rick Perry, asked Wednesday about the Aryan Brotherhood's possible involvement, said it was too soon to link or discount the white supremacist group. ""I think it's obviously too early to be speculating on whether there is any direct contact, but I think it's wise for us to not overlook any evidence that either may be superficial or otherwise,"" he said on Fox News. ""So they are here, they are active in this state. We know the drug cartels are very, very active in our country now,"" Perry said. Public corruption link? Since the January 31 killing of Hasse, authorities have pored through his case files, including public corruption cases. One example involves Eric Williams, a former justice of the peace, convicted last year. Saturday night, hours after the McLellands were found dead at their home, investigators met at a local Denny's restaurant with the convicted official, his attorney told CNN on Tuesday. Investigators took swab samples from Williams' hand to test for gun residue, attorney David Sergi said. The law enforcement official who spoke to CNN said Williams passed some tests looking for gunshot residue. The official said Williams is not considered a leading suspect. Williams is ""one angle we are looking at,"" the official said. Sergi says his client voluntarily cooperated because he has nothing to hide. Williams was convicted of burglary and theft by a public servant and was sentenced to two years' probation. Explainer: What is the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas? Terror threats . As investigators search for leads in the case, authorities say a man called in a threat to a tip line, naming a county official as the next victim. Authorities arrested Nick Morale, 56, on one charge of making a terroristic threat after he allegedly threatened a county official, Lt. Justin Lewis of the Kaufman County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. An arrest affidavit alleges that Morale called the county's Crime Stoppers tip line on Monday afternoon, saying that a county official ""would be the next victim."" Lewis said there was ""nothing to link"" Morale to the slayings of McLelland, his wife or Hasse. Morale was behind bars Wednesday with bond set at $1 million, Lewis said. Authorities declined to release the name or position of the county official who was threatened. Probe of Texas killings looks at corruption cases . 'A trying time' The district attorney's office in Kaufman County, which has about a dozen prosecutors, has kept a low profile since the killings. But it released a statement saying it, too, is trying to grapple with the killings. ""We would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers for the family and co-workers of Mike and Cynthia McLelland; they, and the support that we have received in the last two days, are greatly appreciated,"" the statement read. ""This is certainly a trying time for all of us both professionally as an office, and personally as friends and co-workers of Mr. McLelland and his wife. Our thoughts and prayers go out to their families."" Kaufman County government offices will close Thursday to allow employees to attend a public memorial service in honor of the McLellands, Wood said. A funeral will follow on Friday. Brandi Fernandez, McLelland's first assistant district attorney, has been named to lead the office on an interim basis. She will fill that role until the governor appoints a successor. But whoever becomes Kaufman County's next top prosecutor will have to grapple with a haunting legacy, Kaufman city Mayor William Fortner said. ""I wonder if the governor is going to find anyone brave enough to take the job of district attorney."" Murders of prosecutors in U.S. called 'beyond rare' Gary Tuchman, Ed Lavandera reported from Kaufman County; Chelsea J. Carter, Holly Yan and Joe Sterling reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The suspected cyberattack that appeared to target South Korean banks and broadcasters Wednesday originated from an IP address in China, South Korea's Communications Committee said in a statement Thursday. The attack damaged 32,000 computers and servers of media and financial companies, the committee said. South Korean officials are analyzing the cause and are working to prevent any further damage, the committee said. The attack infected banks' and broadcasters' computer networks with a malicious program that slowed or shut systems down, officials and the semiofficial Yonhap News Agency said. Suspicion immediately fell on North Korea, which has recently renewed threats to go to war with the South amid rising tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and missile testing and international efforts to stop them. South Korea's military stepped up its cyberdefense efforts in response to the widespread outages, which hit nine companies, Yonhap reported, citing the National Police Agency. Government computer networks did not seem to be affected, Yonhap cited the National Computing and Information Agency as saying. A joint team from government, the military and private industry was responding, a presidential spokeswoman said, according to Yonhap. A South Korean official close to the investigation told CNN that malicious computer code spread through hacking caused the outages. How the hackers got in and spread the code remains under investigation, and analysts are examining the malware, the official said. U.S. flies B-52s over South Korea . Wednesday's attack is consistent with what North Korea has done in the past, said Adam Segal, a cybersecurity expert with the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It's happened before in similar circumstances where there have been tensions on the peninsula,"" Segal said. South Korea has accused the North of similar hacking attacks before, including incidents in 2010 and 2012 that also targeted banks and media organizations. The outages come amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, with the North angrily responding to a recent U.N. Security Council vote to impose tougher sanctions on Pyongyang after the country's latest nuclear test last month. Last week, North Korea invalidated its 60-year-old armistice with the South. It has threatened to attack its neighbor with nuclear weapons and has also threatened the United States. The armistice agreement, signed in 1953, ended the three-year war between North and South but left the two nations technically in a state of war. The saber-rattling prompted the United States to deploy B-52 bombers to conduct high-profile flyovers of its South Korean ally and announce that it would deploy new ground-based missile interceptors on its West Coast against the remote possibility that North Korea could strike the United States with long-range weapons. Under threat, South Koreans mull nuclear weapons . Last week, North Korea complained that it was the victim of ""intensive and persistent virus attacks"" from the United States and South Korea, according to KCNA, the official North Korean news agency. Yonhap said Wednesday's outages affected three broadcasters, four banks and two insurance companies. The three broadcasters -- KBS, MBC and YTN -- reported varying levels of trouble containing the virus. While the networks remained on the air, cable network YTN said editing equipment had been affected and it expected to experience broadcasting problems, Yonhap reported. Computer networks stopped working entirely at three banks -- Shinhan, Nonghyup and Jeju -- around 2 p.m. Wednesday, Yonhap reported, citing the National Police Agency. Another financial institution, Woori Bank in Seoul, reported it was able to fend off a hacking attack about the same time. The banks that were affected reported problems with a variety of systems, including Internet banking, ATMs and telecommunication services, and some branches stayed open late because of the slowdown, Yonhap said. CNN's K.J. Kwon reported from Seoul, Jethro Mullen reported from Hong Kong and Michael Pearson wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- British singer Adele is going to have throat-related surgery and is canceling her remaining live appearances for the rest of the year, Columbia Records said Friday. ""She is to undergo surgery to alleviate the current issues with her throat and a full recovery is expected,"" the record company said in a statement. ""As a result, doctors have ordered her to rest her voice and completely recuperate before looking to schedule any work commitments."" Ticket holders will receive a refund from the point of purchase, the record label said. Earlier this month, the 2011 American Music Awards announced that Adele, 23, lead artists with four nominations -- for favorite pop or rock female artist, favorite pop or rock album (for ""21""), favorite adult contemporary artist, and artist of the year. In July, the soulful singer's ""21"" was ranked the year's biggest album to date, with over 2.5 million sold since it was released in late February. Also in July, the disc was a consistent best-seller -- it has spent 10 nonconsecutive weeks at Number One and has never ranked lower than Number Three on the albums chart.

"Washington (CNN) -- The leading Senate negotiations on gun control legislation favor expanding background checks, but the effort would as of now fall short of the universal approach backed by President Barack Obama and many Democrats, CNN has learned. FBI background checks are currently required for commercial sales. The proposal being considered would expand them to gun shows and Internet sales, but would not require checks for other private transactions, according to multiple sources from both parties who are familiar with the talks. Sources familiar with the negotiations between Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, tell CNN they exchanged proposals and ideas over the past few days and will soon get a better sense of where things stand. Toomey joins talks on background checks . Obama made another pitch for his gun control agenda on Monday in Connecticut, not far from the town of Newtown where a December school massacre jolted the nation and prompted current efforts in Washington for stricter gun laws. Obama, in Hartford, angrily chided lawmakers, saying overwhelming support among the American people for measures like universal background checks should force action in Congress. His message was crafted as much for lawmakers as it was for the families of Newtown victims. They sat behind him on stage and were to travel to Washington with him on Air Force One to lobby members of Congress. ""Newtown, we want you to know that we're here with you,"" Obama said. ""We will not walk away from the promises we've made. We are as determined as ever to do what must be done. "" The Senate is expected to begin debate as early as this week over proposed firearms legislation, but Democratic sources admit that the gun bill as currently written does not have the 60 votes needed to break any Republican filibuster. The powerful National Rifle Association is staunchly opposed to the measure. Putting new pressure on negotiators, a spokesman for Mitch McConnell said the Senate Republican leader would support efforts by GOP colleagues to filibuster the Democratic legislation. Democratic leaders are hopeful that a deal on background checks that can win enough Republican support will emerge from the bipartisan negotiations. Obama scolds lawmakers on gun control . Sandy Hook families to return to DC with Obama, lobby Senate . The working proposal between Manchin and Toomey would require background checks as well as make sellers keep a record of transactions. Many law enforcement groups and gun control advocates view record keeping as critical to ensuring the check is enforceable and a weapon is traceable in case of a crime. Senior Democratic aides and sources from outside groups pushing for tighter gun restrictions acknowledge that this approach is less expansive than what they want. But they believe it would produce a better result than the other prominent negotiating track underway - requiring background checks in virtually all cases of private sales, but not mandating that records of those sales and checks be saved. Recent polls show an overwhelming majority of Americans favor making a change to the background check system. McCain: 'I don't understand' threats to block gun bill debate .

"(CNN) -- You might think of Italy's fashion capital when you hear the word Milan, but pop singer Shakira and soccer star Gerard Pique say that isn't what they had in mind when they named their baby boy. Milan Pique Mebarak was born at 9:36 p.m. Tuesday in Barcelona, Spain, according to an announcement posted on Shakira's website. Mebarak is Shakira's seldom-used surname. ""The name Milan (pronounced MEE-lahn), means dear, loving and gracious in Slavic; in Ancient Roman, eager and laborious; and in Sanskrit, unification,"" the announcement said. The 35-year-old Colombian singer first revealed her pregnancy in September, canceling a scheduled weekend concert appearance at a music festival in Las Vegas. Last week, a black-and-white photo on her website showed a pregnant Shakira, wearing a bikini top, standing beside her 25-year-old boyfriend, who plays for Spain's FC Barcelona. The couple called for donations to UNICEF as part of a ""world baby shower"" for them to raise money for gifts such as polio vaccines, therapeutic food and rehydration salts ""for the benefit of babies everywhere."" While their son isn't on the soccer field yet, on Tuesday, Shakira's website said, ""Just like his father, baby Milan became a member of FC Barcelona at birth."" Milan, the couple's first child, weighed approximately 6 pounds, 6 ounces. ""Both mother and child are in excellent health,"" the announcement said.

"London (CNN) -- Prince Philip was hospitalized in Britain on Monday with a bladder infection, forcing him to miss part of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee celebration, Buckingham Palace said. The Duke of Edinburgh, who will be 91 on Sunday, was taken to King Edward VII Hospital in London from Windsor Castle ""as a precautionary measure after developing a bladder infection, which is being assessed and treated,"" the palace said in a statement. The queen's husband will remain hospitalized and under observation ""for a few days,"" the statement said. Prince Charles noted his father's illness while addressing thousands who packed the Buckingham Palace grounds for a concert Monday night featuring music legends including Elton John and Stevie Wonder. ""The only sad thing about this evening is that my father couldn't be here with us,"" the prince said. ""Because unfortunately, he has taken unwell."" Charles then asked the concertgoers to send his father a message, saying, ""If we shout loud enough, he might just hear us in (the) hospital."" The crowd responded with a roar, which segued into chants of ""Philip! Philip!"" In addition to the concert, Philip will miss Tuesday's service of thanksgiving, luncheon and carriage procession marking the 60th anniversary of Elizabeth's coronation. ""He is, understandably, disappointed,"" the palace said. Paul McCartney, one of the performers Monday night, addressed fans outside Buckingham Palace after news of Philip's hospitalization broke, wishing the prince a speedy recovery. In December, Philip spent four nights, including Christmas Eve and Christmas, in Papworth Hospital being treated for a blocked coronary artery. When Philip turned 90 last year, he said he would gradually ""wind down"" his workload. ""I reckon I've done my bit. I want to enjoy myself now ... have less responsibility, less frantic rushing about, less preparation, less trying to think of something to say,"" he told the BBC in an interview. The longest-serving consort in British history, Philip married then-Princess Elizabeth in November 1947 in Westminster Abbey. They had two children, Prince Charles and Princess Anne, before she acceded to the throne, and two afterward -- Prince Andrew and Prince Edward. They have eight grandchildren. Born the prince of Greece and Denmark on the Greek island of Corfu in 1921, Philip left Greece with his family when he was 18 months old after King Constantine was forced to abdicate the throne following a revolution. The family moved to Paris and then England in 1928, and Philip also went to school in Germany. Philip renounced his Greek title when he became a naturalized British subject in 1947. He joined the Royal Navy in 1939, and met Elizabeth in July that year when she visited the Royal Navy College in Dartmouth with her father, King George VI. After Princess Elizabeth became queen, Philip gave up his naval career to support her and embarked on a long career of charity work, notable for its initiatives for young people. Both he and the queen are great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria, and are also related through his father's side -- his paternal grandfather, King George I of Greece, was Queen Alexandra's brother. Philip has made more than 5,000 public speeches during his working life, according to Buckingham Palace.","Prince Charles urges concertgoers to shout so his ill father could hear them .

"(CNN) -- Police and health officials have raided a slaughterhouse and meat company in the United Kingdom as part of an ongoing investigation into horse meat that was labeled as beef, authorities said Tuesday. The West Yorkshire slaughterhouse is believed to have supplied horse carcasses to a firm called Farmbox Meats Ltd., which then sold the meat as beef for kebabs and burgers. Authorities have suspended operations at both facilities and seized all remaining meat and company files, which include a client list. Neither company was immediately available for comment. ""I ordered an audit of all horse-producing abattoirs in the UK after this issue first arose last month and I was shocked to uncover what appears to be a blatant misleading of consumers,"" said Andrew Rhodes, Food Standards Agency director of operations. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson called the revelations ""absolutely shocking."" ""It's totally unacceptable if any business in the UK is defrauding the public by passing off horse meat as beef,"" he said. ""I expect the full force of the law to be brought down on anyone involved in this kind of activity."" Horse meat was discovered in products that are supposed to be 100% beef sold in Sweden, the United Kingdom and France. While authorities said there is no immediate cause for health concerns, the discovery was a new shock to an industry already reeling from a bombshell last month, when Irish investigators found horse and pig DNA in numerous hamburger products. Investigations are under way in France, Sweden and Britain. The supply chain being studied includes more countries. Earlier this month, Britain's National Beef Association called for more specific labeling of meat products and asked that the words ""United Kingdom origin"" be printed on packaging. CNN's Erin Mclaughlin in London contributed to this report .","NEW: National Beef Association calls for more specific labeling of meat products .

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- French and Malian forces squaring off with Islamist militants seized a key city from them Friday, a high-ranking French source told CNN. The city is Konna, in the central region of Mali, a sprawling, landlocked Saharan nation. That region is the latest front in the grinding fight between the West and al Qaeda-linked militants. Read more: Opinion: Why Africa backs French in Mali . The development is an important advance a week after France launched an air and ground military offensive against a strong militant presence across northern Mali and other locations in the sprawling country. Insurgents advancing south toward the capital, Bamako, took Konna on January 10. They started retreating a week ago after the French and Malian forces pushed back, with attacks from the air and other firepower. Read more: France continues Mali airstrikes; residents frantic . The fighting in Mali has captured the world's attention. It was one of the most successful democracies in Africa until last year, when a coup toppled the president and Islamists capitalized on the chaos by establishing themselves in the north. Read more: Six reasons events in Mali matter . There, they imposed a strict interpretation of Sharia law, banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also damaged historic tombs and shrines. France, once the colonial power in Mali, unleashed an offensive against the militants last week, a mission that President Francois Hollande says is designed to ""destroy"" the terrorist groups that have taken root. French envoy stresses urgency . France is sending troops to Mali from military facilities in Africa and from France. Paris is seeking help from its regional allies and the international community. Such assistance has its perils. After Algeria permitted France to use its airspace to take on insurgents, militants angry about the move stormed a gas field in eastern Algeria and took hostages in what is now an ongoing hostage crisis. French Ambassador to Mali Christian Rouyer reiterated the need for the French offensive. ""We had a friendly country that was on the verge of dying,"" he told CNN in an interview Friday. ""It was absolutely necessary to act with urgency. We did it, I believe, with full knowledge of the reasons. Faced with the seriousness of the situation, to my knowledge, there was no other solution."" French military power has been boosted, he said, ""because we know we have an adversary who's determined, who's not afraid, knows the terrain well and who's well-equipped."" The offensive has made an impact, stopping the ""terrorist advance"" and saving other towns: Mopti and Sevare, for example, Rouyer said. ""The advance of terrorist forces -- either in the western or eastern sectors -- has stopped,"" he said, adding that this is helping to establish calm in Bamako. ""If Mopti and Sevare had fallen into terrorist hands,"" he said, ""I believe that today, we would have chaos in Bamako and all Mali."" Prepare for a refugee crisis in Mali . France seeks help . Leaders from several countries have offered troops or logistical support for the offensive. The European Union has approved a training mission. The Canadians and British are deploying military transport aircraft. Nigeria is set to deploy soldiers as part of a U.N.-mandated African force to fight the insurgents. U.S. policy prohibits direct military aid to Mali because the fledgling government is a result of a coup. No support can go to the Malian military directly until leaders are chosen through an election, said Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman. ""We are not in a position to train the Malian military until we have democracy restored,"" she said this week. ""But we're not precluded from assisting allies and partners in trying to restore security to that country."" So far, the United States has only shared intelligence from satellites and intercepted signals with the French, defense officials said. The Pentagon is also considering sending refueling tankers so that French jets can fly longer, more sustained combat missions, according to the officials. U.S. trainers will be in African nations to train forces that are set to be deployed in Mali. ""We have deployed 100-ish, about 100 trainers to Africa. They're traveling to Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Togo and Ghana to discuss training and equipping and deployment needs of those countries in the interest of getting them ready to go into Mali,"" she said. U.N. says warring threatens cultural heritage . The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has issued calls for the protection of cultural heritage sites in Mali. The ancient city of Timbuktu is a UNESCO World Heritage site of huge cultural significance, but its carefully preserved heritage has come under severe threat amid the ongoing conflict. The fabled city, whose name is sometimes used in the West as a synonym for a faraway place, was at the center of trans-Sahara trade in earlier times. Last year, al Qaeda-linked rebels in northern Mali destroyed historic and religious landmarks there, claiming such relics are idolatrous. Now it is threatened by warfare. ""I ask all armed forces to make every effort to protect the cultural heritage of the country, which has already been severely damaged,"" UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova said in an appeal to all combatants. ""Mali's cultural heritage is a jewel whose protection is important for the whole of humanity. This is our common heritage, nothing can justify damaging it."" Refugees flee . The U.N. refugee agency said that in treks that began last year, when the crisis started, Malians are fleeing to other nations, including Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger, Guinea, Algeria and Togo, and many are internally displaced. Refugees in Burkina Faso said ""they fled the recent military intervention, the lack of any means of subsistence, and fear of the strict application of Sharia law,"" the agency said. People talked about family members disappearing. ""They reported having witnessed executions and amputations, and mentioned that large amounts of money are being offered to civilians to fight against the Malian Army and its supporters. According to the accounts from refugees there are children among the rebel fighters,"" the United Nations said. Ethnic Tuareg women and children are among the latest refugees. ""They said that more people, including their husbands and fathers, are on their way to Burkina Faso by foot, many using donkeys or local transport, and many bringing livestock with them. Despite ongoing insecurity in northern Mali in recent months, they say that people have delayed fleeing Mali to allow the men to take care of businesses and animals,"" the United Nations said. Human rights abuses . The United Nations has noted accounts of amputations, floggings and public executions, such as the July stoning of a couple that reportedly had an affair. The International Criminal Court has launched a war crimes investigation amid reports that residents have been mutilated and killed for disobeying the Islamists. ""The current human rights situation is linked to long-standing and unresolved issues,"" and ""human rights violations have been committed both in the North and in the area under government control,"" the Human Rights Council said, citing abuses since January 2012. ""In northern Mali, serious human rights violations have been taking place since January 2012, including summary executions and extrajudicial killings,"" the council said. It also said: . -- Fighters ""allegedly used students as human shields to force military forces to surrender and later on allegedly executed 94 of the 153 captured and disarmed soldiers."" -- Several Tuareg soldiers, including nine in Timbuktu, were also reportedly victims of reprisals by members of the Malian army in the North. -- Among civilian deaths were people who tried to resist the looting of humanitarian warehouses by armed groups. -- Ten amputation cases by extremists were reported in the north, including the case of a 30-year-old man whose right hand was cut off with a kitchen knife for allegedly stealing cattle following a summary trial set up by a militia. -- Women have been assaulted, harassed and abused after being accused of being improperly veiled or dressed, or for riding on a motorbike. In April, six armed men allegedly belonging to the Ansar Dine extremist group raped a woman ""for not wearing her veil in her own home."" -- Rapes of women and girls have been done ""at times in front of family members and often apparently carried out on an ethnic basis."" -- Girls as young as 12 or 13 are reported to have been forcibly married to members of militias. -- Child soldiers who were recruited were sometimes as young as 10.

"(CNN) -- ""I hope you haven't made a mistake,"" Pope Francis told the cardinals at his celebratory dinner after he was chosen to lead the Catholic Church. He then urged the assembled hierarchy to nourish their bodies, and said with a grin, ""May God forgive you for what you've done."" It brought down the house. Pope Francis has already brought surprising changes. He broke with tradition by asking the crowd in St. Peter's Square to pray for him, and then bowed to receive it. This struck at least one young Catholic male, interviewed for the TV cameras, as ""the most humble thing I've ever seen a pope do."" Pope Francis refused to mount the platform previous popes stood on to receive the cardinals, one by one. ""I'll stay down here,"" he told Vatican staff. He shocked many cardinals by choosing the name ""Francis,"" after St. Francis of Assisi, a young man born to wealth, but who lived his life in rags, sitting with lepers and the poor outside the Sistine Chapel. Saint Francis is the patron saint of animals as well as the poor. He is often depicted in art with birds on his shoulder or held in his hands. Some saw it as a sign when a seagull landed on top of the chimney that vents the smoke from burning ballots. What the press began to call ""The Holy See Gull"" sat for 40 minutes on the tin top over the smokestack. It then flew off, but shortly a gull landed again in the same place. The next smoke was white, for Pope Francis. Opinion: Pope Francis is no herald of big changes . Judging from the cardinals I saw interviewed, the new pope is widely considered to be a centrist. He is socially conservative, opposing same-gender marriage, free condoms and abortion, yet he is also known for his care for AIDS patients, washing and kissing their feet, and for baptizing the babies of unwed mothers who other clerics had turned down. He brings a number of ""firsts."" He is the first modern non-European pope. He is the first pope from Latin America (his father was an Italian immigrant) a continent that has 39% of the world's Catholics. He is the first pope who is a Jesuit, a Catholic order that focuses on teaching youth and social justice. But while reporters focus on these firsts, there are other reasons that help explain why the cardinals, in Pope Francis' words, went ""to the end of the Earth"" to find the man to lead the Catholic world, with its 1.2 billion members. Opinion: Pope Francis, open up the church . Four reasons repeatedly came up in interviews with Catholic clerics: They felt it was time to shift the church's geographic center, they like his pastoral centrism, they believe emphasis on ministering to the poor has been missing and they hold a strong conviction that Pope Francis is the man to reform and rebuild a church that has been beset by scandals. That phrase, ""rebuilding the church"" was mentioned by him, according to reports of the pope's first homily. The phrase also comes from the story of St. Francis, who began his ministry by hearing a call to ""rebuild my church."" Pope Francis put his emphasis on the spirituality of the church as being first, lest the church be seen as little more than ""a compassionate NGO"" (non-governmental organization). Navarrette: Pope pick a signal to Latino Catholics . As a practicing Catholic, my personal, fervent hope is that Pope Francis will revive an interest and compassion for the poor. ""We live in the most unequal part of the world, which has grown the most yet reduced misery the least,"" Pope Francis said in 2007. ""The unjust distribution of goods persists,"" he said, ""creating a situation of social sin that cries out to heaven and limits the possibilities of a fuller life for so many of our brothers."" There are indications some cardinals hope this pope will be Christian-friendly to Islam and the developing world. Cardinal Angelo Scola, the archbishop of Milan, heads a foundation to promote Muslim-Christian understanding, and looks after Afghanistan's only Catholic Church as if it were in his diocese. Slamet Effendy Yusuf, a Muslim and head of the Indonesian Ulema Council, told the Christian Science Monitor, ""We believe this is a new chapter in the history of relations between Muslims and Catholics."" I noticed that many cardinals remarked with wonder over the news that Pope Francis, while he was in Buenos Aires, lived in an austere apartment, cooked his own food and took the trolley and subway by himself. That this is a matter of wonder to some who live in stone mansions and have chauffeured cars and chefs is a strong indication change has already arrivedâ€”brought by example. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: Pope Francis has already shown humility since being named .
She says he can be seen as centrist: socially conservative, but champion for poor, afflicted .
She says among reasons he was chosen was belief he can reform church after scandals .

"(CNN) -- Helpless. Hopeless. That's how witnesses described feeling after three people slipped into the foamy waters of the Big Sioux River, in the middle of a Sioux Falls park. The youngest of three -- a 6-year-old boy -- was able to escape the frigid waters alive. But the other two people -- one of them his sister -- who went after him did not survive. ""These people literally jumped in without thinking of their own safety and trying to rescue that child,"" Sioux Falls fire Chief Jim Sideras said. The drama unfolded Thursday evening amidst the 123 acres of Falls Park, which is named -- like the city of Sioux Falls itself -- for the series of picturesque Big Sioux River waterfalls that run through it. According to Sioux Falls police Chief Doug Barthel, the boy had gone into the several-feet-high foam often generated there by the river, and perhaps into the water itself. His sister, who Barthel identified as 16-year-old Madison Wallace, at one point went in after him and ended up falling into the surging water. A bystander, 28-year-old Lyle Eagletail, then went into the river trying to help, said the police chief. He, too, was sucked in -- but not before others at the scene did what they could to save him. One of those who tried was Napoleon Ducheneaux. His shirt muddy, he told CNN affiliate KSFY on Thursday how he and two others had grabbed hold of the man who'd fallen into the river. ""We had him ... but he just slipped,"" Ducheneaux said. ""I heard him say, 'Hold onto me, I'll hold onto you.' That was the last I heard his voice."" Matthew Krier shared Ducheneaux's sense of helplessness about not being able to do more. ""Hopeless, I felt hopeless,"" Krier, who watched the scene unfold from a nearby bridge, told KSFY. ""I wish there was something I could have done."" Authorities from various agencies converged on the scene, their task of finding the two people complicated by zero visibility in the cold, fast-moving, debris-filled waters. Heavy machinery was brought in to break up and remove ice from the river, so that boats and divers could get in, Sideras explained. New water heading into the river was shut off Thursday night, slowing down its flow, but the task nonetheless remained difficult. ""Everybody here is essentially eyes on the water,"" said the fire chief. ""We're looking for something maybe as small as a knee, a patch of clothing."" During the day Friday, the rescuers found the body of the rescued boy's sister. Sideras said he talked with her father afterward. ""They are all in a state of shock,"" the fire chief said. ""Our prayers are with them, and we're just trying to help them cope as best we can."" That left authorities with one more person to find. While there's a limited area as to where he may be, that doesn't necessarily mean his body will be easy to spot. ""It's still going to be an issue of where we're going to find him,"" Sideras said.

"(CNN) -- Walking into the Khatmul Nabeen Masjid (mosque), you can for a moment forget that you're in Afghanistan. Beautiful buildings, walkways, flowerbeds and even a grass soccer pitch. Mohammed Asif Mohseni is said to be behind the law. Young men and women, dressed in Muslim attire, walk around freely and with smiles. Smiles are a bit of a rarity in today's Kabul, a polluted city of survival and despair, so this was both shocking and refreshing to me. We didn't have an appointment but we were hoping to interview Mohammed Asif Mohseni, a conservative Shia cleric. He is said to be the man behind the controversial Shia state law, a law critics say strips Afghan Shia women of many rights. While security was checking our bags, one guard said that Mohseni had been waiting for us. I tried explaining that we did not have an appointment. Nonetheless, we were sent back to where Mohseni was waiting. Before entering the room I was cautioned by a guard to make sure none of my hair was showing below my headscarf. They were apologetic; one even asked me to zip up my sweater higher because too much of my neck was exposed. I complied, tucking in my hair and zipping my sweater as high as it could go. Now paranoid about the design holes in my scarf that exposed parts of my hair, I took off my shoes to enter. As we walked in, Mohseni, an older man with a white beard wearing a Shia-style turban called a ""dulband"" was sitting on a brown couch. He looked at the two men who brought us in and said, ""These aren't the two I was waiting for."" I explained that we just showed up for an interview because we did not have a number to reach him. He smiled and said, ""I guess you are in luck."" Mohseni welcomed us and asked me to translate his warm welcome to our Scottish cameraman. As the interview started, I noticed that Mohseni avoided my eyes. I wondered if it was because I was female. I was also prepared for verbal attacks; a journalist friend told me that when he brought a western journalist to interview Mohseni a few days ago, the journalist ended up having more questions thrown at him than he was able to ask. But it didn't take long for Mohseni to warm up and explain why Shia state law is just and a part of Islam. Those who don't agree don't understand it, he said. ""The law ... which I created I see as correct for both men and women,"" he said. ""We have given rights to both men and women, even better than rights given to women in the West. We give women more in this law."" I asked him about reports that if a woman does not comply in having sexual relations with her husband, then the husband can refuse to feed her. ""Yes, I said that,"" Mohseni said looking me in the eye. ""When a couple marries, sex is a part of marriage, and they agree to that."" He went on to explain that a woman isn't obliged to have sexual relations every single night or if she is told by her doctor to refrain. But otherwise it is her obligation and something she signed up for when she got married. He calls it the wife's duty. Mohseni added that a wife wearing makeup ""prevents a man from thinking about other women on the streets and he can just think of his wife."" He continued: ""It is natural that women (wear makeup). Don't they in the West? Their women wear it on the streets and in shops. Women should put make-up on for their husbands as it will increase the love and attraction between the two."" The cleric also explained that a woman is not required to ask the permission of a man to leave the house if she has a job and needs to go to work. But they do need to get permission if they are leaving for other reasons. More importantly, he said, a couple needs to make clear the day they marry whether or not she will need permission to leave the home. If they disagree then they should not get married. ""Like, you are working for CNN,"" he said. ""If your boss tells you, you'll be working for 8 hours a day, then you're responsible for that. It's the same here. They both have to agree on it."" According to Mohseni, the West is imposing its beliefs on the Muslim world because they don't understand. However, it's not just people in the West who are opposed to this law. Many Afghans, men and women, have vehemently resisted it. They fear it will set women back after the progress that has been made in the last seven years. Sima Samar, head of Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission, has been working for a year now, trying to amend certain articles within the law. ""I feel discriminated. Clear-cut. I don't feel equal in this country,"" she told us. Samar said the law does not represent Islam. It blatantly contradicts the constitution of Afghanistan, which states that men and women are equal. Critics have labeled the law as ""Talibanistic,"" but Samar says even many of the Taliban's actions were not enshrined in law. She admitted that a law for Shias is necessary but that it should be what is stated in Sharia or Islamic Law. ""One of the very important pillars in Islam is justice, there is no justice in this law,"" she said. Samar also pointed out the absurdities in the law, such as the edict on makeup. ""If she doesn't (put on make-up), will the husband go complain to the police that she didn't put (on) the lipstick? Or, 'I like red but she put on pink.'"" However, Samar didn't blame the clerics alone for creating the new law; she blamed various parts of the government for allowing it to pass. ""I think they -- all of them -- took the whole issue very superficially. And none of the state institutions, ministry of justice, parliament, senate and the office of the president, really didn't look at the law as serious as they should,"" she said.","Mohammed Asif Mohseni is said to be man behind Shia State Law .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Salvadoran national wanted in connection with the brutal slaying of a Colorado man was named to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitive list on Thursday. Edwin Ernesto Rivera Gracias is accused of killing of Richard Limon, 69, in August 2011. Law enforcement officials allege that Rivera Gracias choked, beat and stabbed the man and then dumped his body in the mountains outside of Denver. Limon was a longtime family acquaintance of the fugitive's teenage girlfriend, the FBI said. The wanted poster for Rivera Gracias says he's between ages 29 and 33, is about 5 feet, 10 inches tall and weighs approximately 170 pounds. According to the FBI, Rivera Gracias is a member of the Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, gang and has several tattoos, including one of ""MS-13"" across his back. Rivera Gracias was in the United States illegally at the time of the slaying, the FBI says, and he may have fled back to El Salvador. The FBI is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. ""The greatest weapon against crime is the cooperation of all law enforcement and the public they serve,"" said Ronald Hosko, assistant director of the criminal investigative division. Hosko said Rivera Gracias is accused of a ""brutal crime against an elderly person."" At a news conference in Colorado, the victim's daughter said she hopes Rivera Gracias will be caught. ""All I want is for justice to be served because it's hard for me to get over it,"" Michelle Limon said. ""I want justice to be served because I would be able to sleep better at night knowing everyone's paying for what they did."" The FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list was launched in 1950. The program seeks to publicize terrible crimes and get tips that lead to arrests. Rivera Gracias is the 498th person to make the roster. Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was on the list until he was killed in Pakistan during a May 2011 raid by U.S. forces. Alleged Boston mob figure James ""Whitey"" Bulger spent more than a decade on the list and ultimately was captured in June 2011 in Santa Monica, California.

"(CNN) -- If Barack Obama had previewed his inaugural speech before the November election, would he have been able to give it in January? Apparently, our president did not think so. From the first days of his re-election campaign until as recently as a month ago, President Obama described himself ""a pretty practical guy"" who is ""not driven by some ideological agenda."" Dispensing with that fiction in his inaugural address, he's been commended for finally and honestly revealing himself. No longer is Barack Obama a national Rorschach test in which anyone can see anything. He has staked his ground: President Obama is an unabashed advocate of the old-fashioned American left. That's not good news for Democrats who have trekked with him to the end of an ideological limb. Obama's inaugural statement displayed ""a sweeping liberal vision,"" the Los Angeles Times wrote. Andrew Coyne headlined it, ""The Most Full-throated Defense of Liberalism Since FDR."" Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin called it ""a powerful defense of collective action, of government."" Chris Matthew's ""Hardball Blog,"" not known for restraining its lefty enthusiasm, did not disappoint: ""Liberalism is back! President Obama's inaugural address revealed a liberal vision -- a full-throated defense of progressive policy."" Poor old Bill Clinton. Obama's long-delayed public confession of collectivism was not only a rejection of Reaganesque individualism. It was a repudiation of Clinton's New Democrats. Clinton's moderation was useful camouflage during the campaign but only to return Obama to the Capitol steps, unburdened by another election, free to reignite ""the era of big government."" Perhaps at this point, we should believe him: Barack Obama is George McGovern with a jump shot. As David Brooks noted, his liberalism was ""on full display."" His duplicity was, as well. Obama's post-partisan pragmatism, he has confirmed with his inaugural address, was only a useful political contrivance. Blinded by the nobility of his intentions, this president has grown comfortable with deception. He does what is best for the American people, even when it requires that he misleads them. Obama's approach has become the cynical politics he supposedly came to Washington to change. Zelizer: Obama, think big for State of the Union . In his forceful January speech, Obama trumpeted his mission. It is not to leave office as Ronald Reagan, who renewed a failing economy and restored our nation's confidence. Obama's calling is a moral one. The worst recession since the great Depression will have to wait. His mission, inherited from Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, is equality, not revitalization. Yet even as he prepares for Tuesday's State of the Union address, Obama twists and stretches. What he wants is what we need, he tells us. Redistribution's side effect, he pledges, will be a more prosperous America. ""Our economy succeeds and our economy grows,"" he says, ""when everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is getting a fair-shake and everybody is playing by the same rules. Because I believe that is a growth agenda -- not just an equity agenda, not just a fairness agenda -- that is a growth agenda."" As he drives, he pits the destitute passengers in his car against the rich, Hispanics against Anglos, women against men, telling them inequality is their worry. They fight and claw, unaware they are speeding towards a precipice, oblivious to the common danger that makes their differences pale. As long as this president has a Democratic Senate and a veto pen, there will be no deficit reduction, no serious control of entitlements. A government we cannot afford is not Barack Obama's problem. It is his solution. Why would Obama reduce entitlements that redistribute wealth when they force the social change he sees as his legacy? Redistributing wealth, not creating it, is Obama's signal intent. Democratic administrations in our largest cities and states -- from Detroit to Washington, D.C, from California to Obama's home state of Illinois -- have tested this president's old social justice agenda. It has produced a record of relentless economic failure. Yet for this liberal man, economic malaise may just be the price of social justice. And the shock, in my mind, is not his commitment to compulsory redistribution, but that a leader so young has such old ideas. He is a man from America's past. Barack Obama is old-school. He believes in top-down planning, not bottom-up incentives. He sees government as an industrial machine, though he lives in the age of the network. He trusts political and artificial imperatives from Washington, not natural and organic choices by ordinary Americans. His answer to irresponsive, ineffective, unaffordable old government is not reform, but to produce more of it. Obama's bright young smile cloaks archaic ideas, ill-suited for today's global economic race. We have been on this road before. We know where it takes us: . 1. Obama will leave office a hero. 2. He will leave his party a wreck. Barack Obama has calculated he will never get on Mount Rushmore working with Republicans in Congress to fix a broken economy. Their prescriptions and his are incompatible. In the president's view, growth requires money for expansive new government programs. He knows he will never get that money from the Mr. Potter's who run the House of Representatives. His moral vision, however, is a bargain: It requires no funding. From Lincoln, to King, to Obama: In this noble cause, not the struggle for economic renewal, he will shape how he's remembered. His legacy will be The Equal Deal, not a better one. His party will not share his good fortune. In Obama's first term, in 2010, he ignored the nation's economic crisis, moved left, and gave Americans health equality. Republicans swept the House of Representatives. Obama is now replicating that pattern. When this charismatic leader leaves town, he will have returned the Democratic Party to its McGovernite past, leaving it wedded to old, slow, big, dumb, inflexible Industrial Age government. He will leave behind a party that embodies economic stagnation, shackled to the challenges it ignored, and mistrusted with America's checkbook. Democrats have crawled out on a fragile, ideological limb with Barack Obama, a branch loaded with debt and the burden of a sagging economy. It will snap long before they find another Clinton to move their party back to the center, where they can safely renew themselves and rebuild. Democrats he will leave behind should strap on their life preservers: Your president's interests and yours have diverged. Look at the Republican Party George W. Bush left behind after serving two terms. Obama's supporters believe otherwise. They trust their new left-tilting majority will be sustained by an ""emergent Democratic coalition,"" a confederacy of liberals, unions, government workers, black and Hispanic Americans, supplemented by young, single Carrie Bradshaws. They may be right: Unless Republicans wake up and provide a palatable alternative, even a mistrusted, out-of-date, ideologically extreme Democratic Party will have no effective opposition. Only when Republicans move beyond ""No"" and offer an optimistic agenda of bottom-up growth and prosperity for all Americans, can they emerge from their visionless wandering. Are Republicans tired enough of losing to begin to rejuvenate themselves? Marco Rubio will not just give the response to President Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night; he will give the nation its first glimpse of an alternative to the antiquated, top-down Democratic Party Barack Obama will leave us. Tuesday night, we'll see the future. Let the best party and America win.

"(CNN) -- Every chief justice of the United States picks a signature issue. After Wednesday's argument on the future of the Voting Rights Act, it's clearer than ever that John Roberts has made his choice: to declare victory in the nation's fight against racial discrimination and then to disable the weapons with which that struggle was won. Roberts' predecessors staked their ground in many ways. In the '50s and '60s, Earl Warren wanted to integrate the South. In the next decade, Warren Burger decided to fight crime. In the '80s and '90s, William Rehnquist sought to revive states' rights. Roberts came of age as a young lawyer in the Reagan administration, and there he discovered a cause that he has made his own: the color-blind Constitution. In Roberts' first major decision as chief justice, he rejected the school integration plans of Seattle and Louisville. The authorities in those cities used several factors to determine where kids went to school: neighborhood, sibling attendance, but also racial diversity. Roberts' decision banned the schools from considering the race of the students in determining where they went to school. ""The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,"" the chief justice wrote. The voting rights martyr who divided America . Last October, the court heard a challenge to the race-conscious admissions policy at the University of Texas. No decision has yet been made in that case, but during the oral argument, the chief justice peppered the lawyer defending the university's plan with a series of sarcastic questions: . ""Should someone who is one-quarter Hispanic check the Hispanic box or some different box?"" ""What is the critical mass of African-Americans and Hispanics at the university that you are working toward?"" ""So you, what, you conduct a survey and ask students if they feel racially isolated?"" As Roberts wrote in a different case, summing up his views: ""It's a sordid business, this divvying us up by race."" All of that stands as background to the Voting Rights Act case, which was argued Wednesday. It is generally acknowledged that this law, passed in 1965, had a tremendous effect in finally making the right to vote real for African-Americans, especially in the South. Under Section 5 of the act, nine Southern states (and a few other counties) must get the advance approval for all electoral changes from the Department of Justice in Washington. This process, known as pre-clearance, covers everything from drawing the lines of legislative districts to deciding the location of polling places. Several counties have challenged the law, saying, in effect, that it's obsolete. According to this view, the South has changed and now Section 5 represents a demeaning and unconstitutional burden on the covered jurisdictions. At oral argument, Roberts seemed very receptive to this claim. He asked Donald Verrilli, the solicitor general who defended the law, ""Is it the government's submission that the citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North?"" Verrilli said no, but he said Congress still had the right to draw distinctions among states. Throughout the argument, Roberts had nothing but tough words for the lawyers defending the law and little to say to the challengers. A justice's questions at oral argument do not always indicate how he is going to vote, but Roberts' record on these racial issues is already well-established. What does this mean for the country? It depends on whether you believe, like Roberts, that the work of the civil rights movement is done. Race-conscious policies have transformed our schools and workplaces. Diversity is a value cherished by many. Likewise, the Voting Rights Act has given the South new and very different politics. But affirmative action, in Roberts' view, has become discrimination against whites. The country may be about to discover how America looks in the way that the chief justice wants to reshape it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Toobin.","Jeffrey Toobin: From arguments on Voting Rights Act, it's clear chief justice opposes it .
In past rulings, John Roberts has voted down affirmative action policies, he says .

"(CNN) -- When I was a teenager in Toronto, I would spend time with my father watching tennis on television. This is how we bonded. We weren't a sporty family but tennis was a sport my dad loved to watch. He still does. It was through my dad's enthusiasm that I started to recognize the players he would paint as personalities, not just athletes. And there was always one that stood out for my dad: Ivan Lendl. On the court, Ivan Lendl was a quiet but immense force, a counterpoint to John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, the all-American tennis heroes. Growing up in communist Czechoslovakia he appeared to be the opposite of these talented but at times histrionic players. So different in demeanor and background that that it lead Sports Illustrated in 1987 to describe him as ""the champion that nobody cares about."" Lendl was happy for McEnroe and Connors to take the spotlight choosing instead to let his game do the talking. My father would point this out and say ""look at him always keeping his cool, that's what makes him great."" For this man from Ostrava, a city near the Czech-Polish border, focusing on the game was all he knew. Both his parents were successful players; his mother was ranked 2nd in the country, his father 15th. ""I just hung around the older kids and snuck onto the court and that's how I got into it,"" he told me. ""There was not much hope in Czechoslovakia growing up without doing great at sports so I think that was a motivation for a lot of the tennis players at the time."" When he was 21 he moved to the U.S. and just three years later he won his first Grand Slam title at the 1984 French Open where he defeated McEnroe in five sets. ""I don't remember much of it,"" he said during our interview. ""I was very tired. We both were. I just know that throughout the fifth set I felt I should take advantage of it because with John you could never underestimate him because of his strength."" And that was just the beginning. In his career, Lendl would go on to win 94 career singles titles including 8 Grand Slam tournaments, and would spend 270 weeks as No.1. Only Pete Sampras and Roger Federer have beaten that record. Today the 53-year-old is best known for being the coach of the current World No. 3, Andy Murray. The main thing he imparts to the British player is preparation. Win or lose, if you're prepared and you do your best no one can take that away from you. ""You just train and through training and repetition you hit the shot and execute it so many times that all of a sudden you can do it under pressure and that's where the confidence comes from,"" he said. I asked him if a champion or greatness is something that can be taught. He said it all just comes down to ""a lot of work, a lot of talent, a lot of luck."" Before winning the Olympic gold medal and U.S. Open title last year many had questioned Murray's self-confidence. But Lendl believes that while mental strength is key, so are stamina and physical strength. ""These days if the top guys don't play their best in the early rounds they can lose,"" he said. Away from the tennis court and coaching, this father of five spends time with his other love: golf. Believe it or not when it comes to competing Lendl says he still feels nervous. ""It's because I care. If you don't get nervous, you don't care about how you do,"" he said. Two of his daughters also play golf -- choosing it over tennis partly because of the pressure of having to live up to the Lendl name. His advice to them is the same advice his gives Murray: ""When it's going good take it and be humble and when it's not going good, accept it as well and just keep training. Stay level-headed either way. Don't get too high or too low."" Similar words my father often told me. Meeting Lendl became more than an interview. It was an opportunity to bring to life a man my father always loved watching and in doing so reliving a time I treasure today.","Ivan Lendl spent 270 weeks as the world's top tennis player in the 1980s .

"London (CNN) -- Fast food giant Taco Bell said Friday it has taken beef off the menu in its three UK outlets after tests on ground beef from a European supplier revealed traces of horse meat. The discovery of rogue horse meat in a wide range of beef products has thrown the European meat industry into disarray in recent weeks. A Taco Bell spokesman said the company had voluntarily ordered testing of its beef products in light of the scandal affecting other European retailers and food manufacturers. Opinion: Horse meat scandal shines spotlight on murky horse trade . ""Based on that testing, we learned ingredients supplied to us from one supplier in Europe tested positive for horse meat,"" he said. Beef was immediately taken off the menu and will not be served again until the company is satisfied that suppliers meet its standards, he said. ""We apologize to our customers and take this matter very seriously as food quality is our highest priority,"" he said. Taco Bell UK has informed the UK Food Standards Agency, which has been leading the investigation into unauthorized horse meat in Britain, he said. What's behind the horse meat contamination scandal? Two of the three UK Taco Bell outlets are in Essex, northeast of London, and the third is in Manchester, in northern England. There is no link in terms of products to Taco Bell in the United States or other outlets operated by Yum Brands, the spokesman added. Yum also owns Pizza Hut and KFC. ""Our domestic restaurants have not been, and will not be, impacted because we do not use any meat from Europe,"" Taco Bell said in a prepared statement. ""Like all beef in the United States, ours is USDA inspected and then passes our own 20 quality checkpoints."" The horse meat scandal has extended across Europe, with questions raised over slaughterhouses and food suppliers in a number of countries. The Food Standards Agency released the results Friday of the latest round of testing ordered on products labeled beef across the UK food industry. So far, more than 99% of tests continue to show no horse DNA at or above the level of 1%, it said. Horse meat is not harmful in itself but authorities are concerned by its unauthorized presence in case it is tainted with a veterinary drug used to treat horses. Phenylbutazone, also known as bute, is not allowed to enter the food chain because it can pose a risk to humans. The European Union said last month it intends to begin testing meat across all 27 member states.","NEW: Taco Bell says its domestic restaurants have not been affected .

"(CNN) -- Jorge Lorenzo has started the new MotoGP season just as he did in 2012 -- with victory under lights in the Qatar Grand Prix. The world champion, who like last year started the race from pole position, headed off his returning Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi to take the checkered flag with 5.9 seconds' advantage on Sunday. Seven-time world champion Rossi, who clashed with Lorenzo before leaving to join Ducati in 2011, had to hold off rookie rider Marc Marquez before claiming his best result since last September's San Marino GP -- also won by Lorenzo. Marquez, on his debut for Honda Repsol, delivered on the promise he showed in winning last year's Moto2 title as he made up for a poor start that dropped him five places to eighth. The 20-year-old finished ahead of fellow Spaniard and teammate Dani Pedrosa, the championship runnerup last year, while Britain's Cal Crutchlow was fifth. ""I was pretty nervous on the grid because it was my first MotoGP race,"" Marquez said. ""I don't think I've ever been so nervous before. I found it hard to keep calm and I wasn't as focused as in Moto2. ""However, I regained my concentration at the last moment. The start was important and we knew that we were taking off from the dirty part of the track. I didn't get off well, but I was able to attack on the opening laps and overtake many riders -- I think that was the key."" He became the first rookie since Lorenzo five years ago, also at Doha's Losail circuit, to stand on the podium after his debut in the elite level of motorcycling. ""When I rode behind Dani I learnt a lot, also later on with Valentino. Fighting against him is always nice to watch, but it's always tough at the same time,"" Marquez said. ""Valentino was a tough rival to overtake on the final laps. He beat us this time, but we hope to learn from him and from everyone who went faster than us."" The next race of the 18-round competition is at the Circuit of Americas in Austin, Texas in two weeks' time.","Two-time world champion Jorge Lorenzo wins opening race of MotoGP season .

"(CNN) -- The Rolling Stones kicked off their ""50 and Counting"" tour with a marching band, guest appearances from Gwen Stefani and Keith Urban, and a double dose of ""Satisfaction."" When the lights dimmed Friday night at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, UCLA's marching band paraded through the aisles, their horn section blasting the Stones' 1965 hit, ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" -- to the delight of concertgoers Jack Nicholson, Eddie Murphy, Johnny Depp and Nicole Kidman. Finally, the Stones materialized onstage, framed by a massive pair of red lips and a runway in the shape of the band's trademark tongue logo. For two hours and 20 minutes, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts barreled through 23 career-spanning tracks, including ""Paint it Black,"" ""Gimme Shelter,"" ""Miss You"" and ""Sympathy for the Devil."" They even performed the disco-flavored ""Emotional Rescue"" from 1980, which Jagger introduced by saying, ""This is a song we've never done before."" In another first, Stefani stepped from the wings to duet with Jagger on ""Wild Horses."" The No Doubt singer turned fashion designer sported a rather fabulous, bedazzled Stones muscle shirt, which prompted the Rock & Roll Hall of Famer to quip, ""Where do I get one of those T-shirts?"" Later, Urban joined the band for an appearance that was more than ""Respectable."" Armed with his electric guitar, the country superstar matched licks with Richards and Woods, finishing up with a searing solo on the 1978 tune that had the crowd on its feet. Also receiving a warm welcome was guitarist Mick Taylor, who reunited with his former band mates for ""Midnight Rambler,"" a song he regularly performed during his tenure with the Stones from 1969 to 1974. Even with all the guest cameos, the Rolling Stones were clearly the stars of their own production. Every seat in the arena was filled, thanks to promoter AEG Live releasing a slew of unsold seats for $85 at the last minute -- a bargain considering most concertgoers shelled out $150-$600 for their tickets. Friday night, it was not uncommon for fans who paid $450, $250 and $85 to be sitting elbow-to-elbow. Fair? Maybe not. But by the time Mick, Keith, Ronnie and Charlie launched into a spirited reprise of ""Satisfaction,"" most fans agreed it was an appropriate finish, no matter how much they paid for their seats.","The Rolling Stones kicked off their world tour in Los Angeles on Friday .

"(CNN) -- Sachin Tendulkar will attempt to become the first cricketer to score 100 international centuries on Friday as India continue to fight back in the third Test against the West Indies in Mumbai. The 38-year-old ""Little Master"" will resume on 67 on the fourth day in his home city as he seeks to pass three figures for the first time since March. He has scored 51 tons in 183 five-day Tests, and 48 in 453 one-day internationals -- holding the record number of runs scored in both formats of the game. In the opening match of the current three-match series he became the first player to pass 15,000 Test runs, and has helped top-ranked India take an unbeatable 2-0 lead. The home side responded to the Windies' first innings of 590 by reaching 281-3 at stumps on Thursday, with Rahul Dravid becoming only the second player after Tendulkar to pass 13,000 runs as he made 82. Gautam Gambhir put on 67 for the first wicket with Virender Sehwag (37) before falling for 55. Dravid came to the crease at 138-2, and added 86 with Tendulkar before falling short of his 37th Test hundred and 49th overall. V.V.S. Laxman kept the momentum going with a brisk 32 off 53 balls as he and Tendulkar put on an unbroken 57. Tendulkar, who has scored seven tons against the Caribbean team in all formats of the game, registered his 63rd half-century in Tests as he hit five fours and a six from 133 balls faced. He survived a scare on 38 when he was dropped by Carlton Baugh. The West Indies' final pair lasted only 3.1 overs at the start of the day, adding 15 runs to the team's overnight total of 575-9. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin bowled Devendra Bishoo for 12 to earn the 25-year-old's second five-wicket haul of his debut series, ending with figures of 5-156, while Fidel Edwards was 11 not out. Gambhir said the Indians were focused on avoiding the follow-on target of 390. ""The team is not thinking much about Sachin's 100th hundred, but what we require at the moment. West Indies have set a big target and it's important to save the follow-on,"" told the Cricinfo website. ""If Sachin gets his 100th ton in that course it's good, but we are focused on the team objective.""","Sachin Tendulkar needs 33 runs to become first to score 100 international tons .

"(CNN) -- The man who once indignantly remarked, ""I'm a fascist, not a racist,"" has publicly disavowed his past far-right statements after the storm of controversy that has followed his appointment as manager of an English Premier League soccer team. Sunderland's decision to hire Paolo Di Canio at the weekend has left the club and the Italian facing a barrage of questions about his past, when he has admitted being ""fascinated"" by his country's former dictator Benito Mussolini. He even has tattoos of fascist emblems. His new club's vice-chairman, prominent politician David Miliband, stepped down as soon as the announcement was made. At first Di Canio refused to respond, saying he would only talk about football-related matters. However, following widespread media pressure, protests from local war veterans, anti-racism groups, a leading church member from England's north-east region whose mother was a Jewish refugee, and several anti-Di Canio Facebook pages, the 44-year-old has released a statement to clarify his beliefs. ""I feel that I should not have to continually justify myself to people who do not understand this, however I will say one thing only -- I am not the man that some people like to portray,"" Di Canio said in a statement on Sunderland's website on Wednesday. ""I am not political, I do not affiliate myself to any organization, I am not a racist and I do not support the ideology of fascism. I respect everyone."" Di Canio was once a member of a hardcore right-wing fan group that follows his hometown team Lazio -- the club where he started his career and later got into trouble when he returned, when he made straight-arm salutes to the crowd in 2005. At the time he was praised by members of Mussolini's family, but the football authorities fined him and suspended him for one match. Lazio, meanwhile, has been charged four times this season over the racist behavior of its fans. The decision by Sunderland's American owner Ellis Short to hire a man with such a controversial past was seen by many as being at odds with the club's strong family values. Its work with children in the community helped secure a sponsorship deal with the ""Invest in Africa"" group and also led to a partnership with the Nelson Mandela Foundation. Both have said that Di Canio's appointment will not affect their relationship with Sunderland, while several fan groups told CNN Tuesday that they supported his arrival. ""It is a football-related matter and under the remit of the club,"" an Invest in Africa spokesman told the UK Press Association. The Mandela charity, whose partnership was publicly launched at a high-profile home match against Manchester United on Saturday, met with Di Canio and club officials on Monday. ""At the heart of the partnership is a commitment to our Founder's values with a special focus on human rights and anti-racism,"" it said in a statement Tuesday. ""At the meeting on Monday, Sunderland reaffirmed its commitment to these values and the ethos of the partnership."" Di Canio is now hoping to focus on the task of keeping Sunderland in the top division, in what is only his second managerial role after less than two years at Swindon -- a club he took from the fourth tier of the English game to the third before quitting over its financial problems. His new team is just one point above the relegation zone with seven games to play ahead of his first match in charge -- Sunday's trip to fourth-placed Chelsea. ""I have clearly stated that I do not wish to speak about matters other than football, however, I have been deeply hurt by the attacks on the football club,"" he said Wednesday. ""This is a historic, proud and ethical club and to read and hear some of the vicious and personal accusations is painful. I am an honest man, my values and principles come from my family and my upbringing. ""Now I will speak only of football.""","English soccer club's new manager issues statement denying he has fascist beliefs .

"(CNN) -- Most Americans think of the Arctic as an icy, distant place; beautiful, remote and teeming with wildlife, but unrelated to their daily lives. Nothing could be further from the truth. This summer, big doings on America's northern doorstep will have enormous consequences to the economic, strategic and environmental future of the nation. Yet we are unprepared for the challenges and opportunities. What happens in the Arctic as ice melts there could soon cheapen the cost of the gas you buy and products you purchase from Asia. It could help make the nation more energy independent. It could draw our leaders into a conflict over undersea territory. It is already challenging Washington to protect millions of square miles filled with some of the most magnificent wildlife on Earth, and native people whose culture and way of life is at risk as a squall line of development sweeps across the once inaccessible top of the planet. Opinion: It's time to develop our Arctic resources . For America, the stakes are huge: A chance to gain wealth and global influence in the newest geopolitical playing field, but there is also potential environmental and security disaster if looming challenges are mishandled or ignored. If that sounds farfetched, consider the following: . -- Shell is poised to sink exploratory wells -- temporary ones drilled from ships -- 70 miles north of Alaska in a few weeks. The operation will assess whether an estimated 27 billion barrels of oil is there. This is roughly three times the amount that has been extracted from the Gulf of Mexico over the past 20 years. Shell Oil ship slips anchor; incident raises questions about Arctic drilling plan . Proponents believe a discovery would cut America's dependence on foreign oil and provide jobs and needed revenue to the Treasury Department. They say the oil could be extracted safely. Opponents fear a spill would be a disaster, being difficult to clean up in icy seas. More oil companies wait in the wings and also own offshore leases. -- In Washington, politicians are jockeying over whether to ratify ""The Law of the Sea Treaty,"" under which countries abutting oceans will be able to claim up to 200 extra miles of undersea territory if they can prove it an extension of their continental shelves. For the U.S., that could mean extra territory the size of California off Alaska. President Barack Obama and former President George W. Bush support the treaty, as does an oddly aligned group including the Pentagon, Sierra Club, oil companies, shipping companies and environmentalists, who favor the part of the treaty designed to help protect the world's oceans. Although every other Arctic country has ratified the treaty, in the U.S. it has been blocked for years by conservative senators who fear that it gives too much influence to multinational bodies. -- An undersea land rush has started under the treaty, with Russia claiming an area the size of France and Spain combined. Norway's claim has been granted, and other Arctic nations preparing to file claims. One U.S. Coast Guard admiral, speaking of the treaty, told me, ""If this was a ball game, the U.S. wouldn't be on the field, in the stadium or even in the parking lot. We're last in this race."" -- The Russian military has identified the Arctic as one of the likely places for conflict to erupt in the 21st century over resources. Even if actual combat never occurs, whoever controls the high north will wield enormous influence in the coming decades. Russia has 18 working icebreakers. The U.S. has one. Russia is opening their Arctic sea lanes to commercial shipping. The U.S. has no permanent Coast Guard or Naval presence yet in the high north, although both branches of the service are preparing to move north. Naval war games last fall anticipated security challenges in the near future: how to deal with terrorists in the Arctic, how to deal with a rogue ship carrying nuclear weapons in the Arctic, how to move a U.S. fleet around the top of the planet, how to help clean up an oil spill. Gamers concluded the Navy needs to prepare and needs more resources. -- The Northwest Passage is the long-dreamed-of, formerly iced-over sea route between Europe and Asia. This route around the top of Canada and Alaska has killed hundreds of sailors and explorers for centuries, locking their ships in ice, starving them, freezing them, driving them insane and causing survivors to eat each other. Yet in summers, that passage is now so clear that tourist ships routinely sail through it. Even private yachts make the trip. It is expected that commercial shipping will follow. That's because a single Chinese container ship sailing the Northwest Passage between Shanghai and New York instead of using the Panama Canal would save an estimated $2 million each way on gas and tolls. In short, the region is opening. For the past three years, I've spent much time in northern Alaska researching for my book, ""The Eskimo and the Oil Man."" It's about the grand challenges facing the world there, as seen through the eyes of an Inupiat Eskimo leader who is a grandfather and whale hunter, and the Shell executive sent to drill for oil off Alaska's North Slope. I sailed on the only U.S. icebreaker for six weeks, sat in on meetings at the Senate over the Arctic, attended a naval war game and met regularly with other oil executives and Inupiat leaders, whale hunters and families on the North Slope. That 4,000-year-old culture sits at the border between wise development and environmental anarchy, and the people of America's polar county will soon watch with hope and fear as the oil ships move north. Their concerns are not just local ones but should engage every American. If you care about the environment, if you care about gas prices, if you care about where our soldiers and navy may serve next, if you want the U.S. to remain strong and dominant in the world, look to the north this summer. Look to the Arctic. That's where much of our common future is about to play out.

"London (CNN) -- Germany has been at the very heart of the European Union since it began 60 years ago as a way of pooling coal and steel resources -- and of preventing future wars on a continent already devastated by brutal conflicts. But as the region's strongest economy, it has borne the brunt of the cost of recent rescue deals, and the country's troubled history has meant its insistence on unity is viewed with suspicion by some of its neighbors. So why is Germany still so willing to do all it can to protect the European Union? And will anything shake its faith in the euro? Why does Germany play such a key role in Europe? Germany was one of the founding nations of the European Union, which was designed to ensure that the continent would never again be torn apart by war. Following World War II, Germany's neighbors wanted to hobble any future attempts by the nation to remilitarize; the French decided that the best way to do this was economically, rather than ideologically. ""France wanted to 'tame' Germany, and so the new Europe was built around that Franco-German relationship, starting from a clean slate,"" said Professor John Loughlin, of Cambridge University's department of politics and international studies . ""Germany was completely devastated after the war, and that meant it could begin again from scratch, build a new Germany, a new democratic nation, using economic growth as the basis for that democracy. ""European integration became a part of that, part of the rehabilitation of Germany as a nation among nations."" How has Germany's economy performed over the years? In the post-war years, West Germany enjoyed a massive boom, as the nation made the most of the support it was offered and the opportunities that came its way to recover from the devastation of WWII. ""The Marshall Plan money coming in helped, but Germany's industriousness also played a big part,"" said Loughlin. ""There is a very strong work ethic, and the country has a large population -- it all combined to allow Germany to re-emerge as a major power."" West Germany flourished in the 1950s, 60s and 70s -- the period of the so-called ""Wirtschaftswunder"" [economic miracle] -- while other European nations, including France and Britain, struggled. But reunification with East Germany in 1990 following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union dented the country's fortunes. ""The reunification of Germany impoverished the country to a certain extent,"" said Loughlin. ""The new Laender [regions] came in and resources had to be transferred from rich regions to poorer ones."" ""People forget that 10 to 15 years ago, Germany was going through a crisis like those affecting Italy and Spain now,"" said Dr Alex Clarkson, of King's College London's department of German. ""Back then, it was Germany that was seen as 'the sick man of Europe.' The government had overspent, and had to make fundamental economic reforms -- the system was close to paralysis. ""Of course in that case -- as in the case of Canada, South Korea and others -- they were able to reform at the right time, when the going was good. Spain and Greece have to make similar changes now, but of course there is no growth to carry their economies forward."" And how strong is it now? Germany has long been the economic powerhouse of Europe, but the nation is not immune from the global financial crisis. It is the continent's largest economy, but it also has a high rate of government debt, at 83.2% of GDP, and higher unemployment -- at 7.1% -- than many of its neighbors, according to 2010 figures. Much of Germany's might comes from its strong manufacturing sector, which has meant that, unlike many of its neighbors, the country has not had to rely on the financial services industry or the property market, both of which have been badly hit by the global economic crisis. But experts warn that Germany, which relies heavily on trade with China, may be highly exposed to any future trouble in the Asian markets. And Dr Christoph Meyer, senior lecturer in European and international studies at King's College London, said despite its success so far, the German economy was not bulletproof. ""There is a lot of uncertainty out there, because the world is facing a wider recession, and in that case, who will buy German products?"" Is Germany propping up the euro? ""The short answer to that is yes,"" says Meyer. ""If Germany was not there as the anchor, offering stability, and with its economic weight -- as one of the world's most successful economies -- behind it, we would not still be talking about resolving the crisis -- it would be over already. ""But that doesn't mean Germany can do it alone."" Chancellor Angela Merkel has insisted even those outside the eurozone must do their bit to resolve the crisis. What do ordinary Germans think of the crisis? Experts say it is inevitable that there is a degree of resentment on the part of German citizens, when faced with the responsibility of clearing up another neighbor's mess. ""Most ordinary Germans are quite unhappy with having to bail out the southern European countries, they aren't happy at having to give them their money,"" said Meyer. ""But then most West Germans weren't happy about giving money to East Germans after reunification either."" He added that while the crisis had initially hit Merkel's popularity among voters, her approval ratings had risen in recent months. How do other nations view Germany's actions? The eurozone crisis has provided plenty of fodder for eurosceptic media and politicians across the continent, with many press reports feeding off old tensions and rivalries. Loughlin said claims in anti-German sections of the media in Britain and elsewhere that the country is ""trying to take over Europe"" were used by politicians to boost their standing at home, but could do real damage to international relations. ""It is a delicate situation, because there is a real risk of inflaming old passions and resentments,"" he said. ""Those knee-jerk reactions can have major impacts -- we need statespeople, not mere politicians, who can rise above it. ""The idea that German history is repeating, that there is some plot to take over Europe, is ludicrous. ""It comes down to how different countries view the European project -- whether they see it as a market, like the British, the Swedes, the Danes; or whether they see it as a grand political project to create a new political system, like the Germans. ""Everyone is suspicious of each other, and that undermines any plan for greater integration."" Clarkson said Germany was in a Catch-22 situation. ""The Americans, and others, demand that Germany takes action, but when they do, they are accused of trying to take over -- it is the curse of power."" Is there a danger the eurozone crisis could derail Germany's economy? ""Germany has had a 'good recession' until now,"" said Meyer. ""It has benefited from the crisis so far, but now even Germany is having difficulty selling bonds. ""The question is, at what point does the pain start for Germany? It is not hitting people's pay packets at the moment. ""But it is inevitable that the German economy will be hit. There will be costs, be they the massive costs of a disorderly breakup of the eurozone and a move to some other currency, or the -- still large -- costs of the bailout. ""There will be substantial costs, both short term and long term, to allow the peripheral countries of the eurozone to catch up, and when those come through there will be a growth of euroscepticism in Germany."" Why are Germany's leaders so committed to the euro, and how far will they go to protect it? Experts say Germany is committed to the euro, and prepared to go to great lengths to protect it. ""Germany found it very difficult to give up the Deutschmark -- it was a symbol of the country's recovery, and giving that up to join the euro was a big sacrifice,"" said Loughlin. But there are limits to the country's patience. ""It depends on the behavior of the other European partners,"" said Meyer. ""Germany is doing as much as it can, but the other nations have to be reasonable, Germany can't help 'at any price.' ""The other countries need to be ready and willing to address their problems, to make changes -- Merkel can't keep writing blank checks if the conditions aren't being met. ""No-one wants to pour water into a leaking bucket forever.""","Germany has been at the very heart of the European Union since it began 60 years ago .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China in 1978 was stranded at a political crossroad. It was just emerging from the chaos of the Cultural Revolution and the death of Chairman Mao. Deng Xiaoping had emerged as the new leader, but Mao's dogma remained deep-rooted and seemingly immutable. In and outside the Communist Party, a debate raged: Where to, China? CNN Beijing Bureau Chief Jaime FlorCruz worked on a farm in China's Hunan province during the 1970s. On December 18, 1978, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping gave his answer. In a Communist Party meeting in Beijing that day, the political elite adopted Deng's pragmatic program and launched economic reforms. New China was born. People paraded in the streets to celebrate. Families gathered around the dinner table, uncorked wine bottles and toasted each other. Thirty years hence, China's radical makeover is apparent. China now is nothing short of an economic miracle. Its economy has grown at an average of 9.8 percent since 1978, making it the fourth largest economy in the world. Incredibly, China has pulled off the equivalent of reform, renaissance and industrial revolution in 30 years.  Watch what Deng unleashed » . It's incredible because only three decades ago China was so poor and isolated. I saw it up close when I worked on a farm in Hunan province, Chairman Mao's hometown, not long after I first arrived in China in 1971. For several months, I worked there with a production team planting rice, picking tea leaves, feeding pigs and digging ditches. Farmers worked hard and lived Spartan lives. Once, I attended a meeting to honor model workers; they were awarded bath towels and wash basins.  Watch FlorCruz describe China's transformation since his arrival in 1971 » . Today, my Hunan workmates have retired or changed jobs. The farm has disbanded, hit by the squeeze in state subsidies and by local and global competition. It has sold off its land to the local government and to real estate developers.  Watch as China marks 30 years of reform » . Thirty years ago, there was little international trade. There were few tourists and few cars, but there were millions of bicycles on the streets. Now the streets are jammed with cars, and the air is polluted with fumes, grit and noise. Beijing's neighborhoods used to be very quiet. Residents lived simple lives mostly in walled courtyards. A seven- or eight-story building was considered unusually high. Now they are dwarfed by skyscrapers which house fancy shopping malls and outlets like McDonald's, KFC and Starbucks. Fashion used to be just as simple, and utilitarian Regulation attire was the so-called Mao jackets in blue, green and gray and baggy pants of the same colors. The unisex look was the norm. Now street fashion is varied and colorful, if not always chic. Virtually everyone had a job 30 years ago, but they earned little money, and there was little to buy. Supplies of basic commodities were so tight that residents were doled out ration coupons, required to go with cash to buy cotton jackets and clothes, grain, and cooking oil. No coupons, no transaction. Consumers in the late seventies coveted the so-called ""four big things"" -- a radio, a bicycle, a sewing machine and a wristwatch. And they were available only in special shops, like the Friendship Store. Now the new ""big things"" would include a Mercedes Benz, an apartment and a week-long vacation in Bali or Hawaii. All this would have been inconceivable 30 years ago. But Deng Xiaoping did conceive. Fondly remembered as the ""chief architect"" of China's reform and open-door program, he envisioned a modern, prosperous China and pointed the way forward. Deng's reforms set off a series of seismic changes, starting in the countryside with the disbanding of the people's communes. He admonished farmers to work hard and get rich. The farmers responded enthusiastically. Later, Deng shifted the reform to the cities by experimenting with capitalism in designated Special Economic Zones and then spreading it nationwide. Deng's reform was hailed as a Second revolution. When I worked as a reporter for Time Magazine (1982-2000) the magazine honored him as Time's Man of the Year -- not just once but twice. There was opposition along the way. There was backlash from the Left and from the Right, as China oscillated from free-wheeling capitalism to puritanical communism. That's why there were political campaigns in and outside the party, like the one against ""bourgeois liberalization"" in the 1980s. And that was largely why the Tiananmen protests happened in 1989. China has come a long way, but in my interviews with Deng's political successors, they made it clear that China will have to proceed cautiously and change step by step. ""Cross the river while feeling the pebbles under the water,"" was the aphorism proposed by the former premier Zhao Ziyang. Why the caution? When I interviewed then President Jiang Zemin in 1999, he explained why. ""There is no encyclopedia that China could simply copy and follow,"" he said. China's reforms have brought about remarkable achievements, but they also triggered unintended consequences: rising unemployment, growing income gaps, environmental degradation, corruption, rising criminality and social unrest. China has done the easy part. Now comes the hard part. China is facing the ripple effects of the global economic downturn: Chinese exports are declining, factories are closing down, workers are laid off en masse. China's leaders are facing one of the worst economic crises in 30 years. It will take 30 years and more for China to find the right development model so it could change steadily without losing its national identity, ruining its environment and disrupting social and political harmony. Only then can they fully realize Deng Xiaoping's goal of a modern and prosperous China.","China has undergone a radical makeover in the 30 years since Deng's reforms .

"(CNN) -- Martin Liefeldt has vacationed in the United States four times, and his experience entering the country has ""steadily declined."" ""Last time, I was made to feel most unwelcome,"" wrote Liefeldt, a general manager from Cape Town, South Africa, via e-mail. ""I understand the huge levels of paranoia that exist in the USA, but a bit of training in welcoming visitors (and their money) to the USA might go a long way,"" he wrote. After a long overseas flight, visitors to the U.S. just want to land on terra firma, get some rest and get on with their business or leisure activities. But there are a few more hurdles to getting out of the airport, and a survey released Tuesday suggests that clearing Customs and Border Protection is a big one. The government's recent forced budget cuts are likely to make Customs lines still more daunting. ""When you're greeted with something that's less than welcoming, that first taste in your mouth is quite disconcerting,"" said Geoff Freeman, chief operating officer of the U.S. Travel Association, the industry trade group that conducted the survey in partnership with Consensus Research. In the survey, 43% of the travelers who have visited the U.S. said they would discourage others from making the trip because of the entry process. The survey, which included responses from 1,200 overseas travelers, also found that more than two out of five potential business travelers won't come to the U.S. in the next five years for the same reason. About 64% of responders said they were frustrated by long lines and wait times. The survey was conducted in 2012, before the forced government spending cuts under the sequester went into effect on March 1. Yet the government spending cuts are likely to make the entry process ""exponentially worse"" for travelers, Freeman said. Automatic budget reductions must be applied to nearly every Department of Homeland Security program, including Customs and Border Protection, and ""will negatively affect the mission readiness and capabilities of the men and women on our front lines,"" the agency said in a statement responding to questions about sequestration. ""CBP is working to minimize impacts to travelers to the greatest degree possible while maintaining the highest standards of security."" From March 5 to 11, passengers on 260 flights experienced Customs wait times of more than two hours, with some waits lasting more than three hours, the agency said. The U.S. Travel Association estimates that losing overseas travelers to bad experiences or word-of-mouth is costing the economy at least $95 billion in total output and more than a half million jobs across the economy. Customs and Border Protection, which has developed programs in recent years to speed entry for trusted travelers who undergo prior screening, interviewed more than 25,000 travelers at U.S. airports in July and August 2012 for its second customer satisfaction survey. ""The survey is expected to be released this spring; however, early results indicate that a large percentage of travelers agree the CBP process made them feel welcome to the United States,"" CBP said of its survey. Overall, international arrivals to the U.S. are up. The U.S. Commerce Department expects 23% growth in the number of annual international visitors by 2016. That number includes arrivals from Mexico and Canada, which account for much of the growth. Overseas arrivals, excluding Mexico and Canada, are also up, but the United States' market share of overseas travelers has dropped from 17% in 2000 to 12% in 2011, Freeman said. U.S. Travel puts forward a three-pronged approach to welcoming international travelers to the United States: promoting the U.S. to international visitors, easing the process for getting visas and making the entry experience a smooth one. To compete with other countries in promoting tourism, the United States' first national tourism corporation, Brand USA, was established through the Travel Promotion Act in 2010. The U.S. State Department has done ""tremendous work"" in speeding up the visa process, Freeman said, and posts visa interview wait times on consulate websites. Customs and Border Protection needs to adopt similar transparency, he said, in addition to committing to 30 minutes or less to process each arriving traveler and hiring an additional 1,000 officers to make the entry process more efficient. In an era when Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has cautioned travelers to expect long airport security and customs lines because of worker overtime cuts and furloughs, finding the estimated $150 million to pay for those additional workers seems unlikely. U.S. Travel says easing the entry process is worth the investment. ""It's time to get this fixed,"" Freeman said. ""Our economy can't afford this kind of inefficiency."" What do you think? What have you experienced in the U.S. or other countries?","Survey: Entry process is turning travelers off visiting the U.S.

"(CNN) -- The New Jersey Attorney General announced criminal charges Friday against state troopers involved in the unauthorized high-speed State Police escort of a caravan of high-performance sports cars dubbed ""Death Race 2012"" by local media in March. Authorities allege Sgt. First Class Nadir Nassry, 47, and Trooper Joseph Ventrella, 28, led the caravan of exotic, high-speed sports cars down a state highway to Atlantic City without proper authorization and drove at unsafe speeds, endangering other motorists on March 30, 2012. According to the Attorney General's office, the drivers of the cars were part of a sports car club that included former New York Giants running back Brandon Jacobs. Before the high-velocity trip, prosecutors say, the troopers altered their license plates by using black electrical tape to change the numbers. Nassry is said to have instructed the other drivers in the caravan to ""conceal or partially conceal their plates using tape or other means,"" according to a press release from the office of Attorney General Jeffrey S. Chiesa . ""No one is above the law, and the public expects and deserves a higher level of conduct from our state troopers, most of whom deliver admirably and professionally in that regard,"" Chiesa said. ""The conduct alleged here jeopardized public safety and undermined the trust the public places in law enforcement and the State Police. Serious misconduct by any state trooper must be met with serious discipline and, where warranted and appropriate, criminal charges."" Ventrella's attorney could not be reached Friday, but Nassry's attorney, Charles J Sciarra said his client acknowledges running the escort was a bad idea, but that he refutes allegations he altered his license plate. He points to Nassry's 25 year service record as proof. ""Sgt. Nassry denies the charges, admits the escort was a mistake and has moved to retire as a result, and will fight these charges and for his well earned pension after an otherwise unblemished career."" For their alleged part in the license plate changes, Nassry was charged with third-degree tampering with public records or information and fourth-degree falsifying or tampering with records. Ventrella was charged with fourth-degree falsifying or tampering with records. ""The alleged actions of these two troopers in altering the license plates of their troop cars were clearly intended to conceal their involvement in conduct that they knew was wrong,"" said Chiesa. State Police officials revealed new Standing Operating Procedure addressing escorts Friday too. The new procedure outlines when escorts are authorized and places an emphasis on public safety a statement said. Authorities also announced disciplinary charges against four other troopers in connection with a similar State Police escort involving similar vehicles in 2010, and disciplinary charges against a trooper who improperly handled a speeding ticket issued to a member of a driving club in his Lamborghini in 2010. The Attorney General's office said that while their investigation remains open, it is ""unlikely"" any of the sports car drivers will be charged with any crimes. ""Here is the real issue,"" Sciarra said. ""My client denies he told anyone to tape their plates while some unknown number of affluent exotic car owners explained their taped plates by saying the trooper said to do it. Why are affluent exotic car owners' words given any more credence by this administration than a decorated public servant? The administration may not want to ask tough questions of affluent exotic car owners with who knows what kinds of connections, but we will."" Nassry and Ventrella have been suspended without pay since April 23. If convicted of the criminal charges, both troopers would lose their jobs and pensions, face large fines and possible jail time. Nassry faces 3-5 years in prison and Ventrella faces 18 months.","New Jersey AG announces criminal charges against state troopers .

"Xianiezhuang Village, China (CNN) -- On most days, Zhang Huanzhi doesn't look the part of a fighter for justice. Whenever she catches a break between tending the cornfield and feeding livestock, the 67-year-old farmer from northern China goes to court. ""I bike to the closest bus stop and then take a two-hour ride to the Hebei provincial high court,"" Zhang said, as she thrashed sorghum in her courtyard one afternoon, her disabled husband sitting nearby. ""I've been doing this for the past six years -- and as long as I can still move, I'm not giving up."" Her only son, Nie Shubin, was executed in 1995 -- when he was 20 -- for raping and killing a woman. A decade later, another man confessed to the same crimes. Since then Zhang has made countless journeys to the courthouse in the provincial capital of Shijiazhuang -- 320 kilometers (200 miles) southwest of Beijing -- with one simple yet futile appeal: retry the case to exonerate her son. With more details emerging from domestic news coverage, many have viewed Zhang's plight -- and Nie's case -- as an egregious example of the flaws in the Chinese criminal justice system, including the use of torture, deficient due process and lax review of death sentences. Zhang is now back in the public spotlight, as the government proposes major revisions to its criminal code -- the first in 15 years -- ostensibly aimed at better protecting its citizens and preventing a recurrence of situations like what happened her son. Her fight nevertheless continues to hit a wall and even the People's Daily -- the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party -- ran a scathing commentary in September that asked: ""In a case where someone was clearly wronged, why has it been so difficult to make it right?"" ""Rehabilitation means little to the dead, but it means a lot to his surviving family and all other citizens,"" it added. ""We can no longer afford to let Nie's case drag on."" A mother's dogged pursuit . Zhang now seals her most treasured possessions in a Ziploc bag: two old photos and several legal documents. ""He was about 19 and it was taken right here in our courtyard,"" she recalled, pointing to the fading color prints of her shy stuttering son -- a square-faced teenager wearing a blue tank top in one picture and shirtless in the other -- beaming for the camera. Nie was taken into custody not long after the photos were taken and would never see his mother again. Zhang said local police, during their several visits to question the family and search the house, never told her why they had detained her son. Court documents cited ""tips from local residents"" but did not elaborate. Authorities tried Nie behind closed doors and barred the parents from the courtroom, but Nie told a lawyer hired by his family that he was beaten into a confession on his sixth day in jail. Zhang was convinced that Nie was a victim of torture, after seeing her normally healthy son walk with a limp into the courthouse before the first trial. Seven months after he was first detained, the government executed Nie in April 1995 -- without notifying his parents. After the initial shock, Zhang had to endure more agony to locate her son's remains and deal with a failed suicide attempt and subsequent half-paralysis of her husband, who was crushed by Nie's execution. Living off her husband's monthly pension of $150, Zhang learned to take care of the family by herself. Her daily routine, however, was disrupted in 2005 by a sudden influx of Chinese reporters, who revealed to her that a man named Wang Shujin had just confessed to the same crimes Nie was executed for a decade earlier. Carefully laying the contents from her Ziploc bag on a table, Zhang described each legal document as she recounted her six-year lone quest for justice: a copy of the verdict against Nie that detailed his ""crimes;"" a 2007 letter from the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, in which the nation's highest court instructed the Hebei high court to ""process"" her appeal; and most importantly, a printout of a written statement by Wang's lawyer on his client's confession. The lawyer, Zhu Aimin, confirmed to CNN that Wang has admitted to the crimes Nie was convicted of -- with corroborative details. Ironically Wang, sentenced to death for four other murder and rape cases, is now receiving a reprieve, as his connection to the Nie case has delayed the completion of his second trial. Officials from the Hebei high court in Shijiazhuang and the Supreme People's Court in Beijing never responded to CNN's requests for comment despite repeated phone calls and faxes. ""The cold reality doesn't offer us ordinary people much hope -- so why do I keep pursuing?"" Zhang said. ""I don't want to hold anyone responsible, I don't want government compensation, and I don't want the judge to bring back my son alive -- but one thing I must have is his innocence."" New law, old problems . In recent years, state media have exposed an increasing number of wrongful convictions in China. At least five death row inmates -- most reportedly tortured during police interrogation -- were set free, either because their ""victims"" turned up alive years after the alleged murders, or the real perpetrators were caught. Such cases could be prevented if the new Criminal Procedure Law takes effect next March as scheduled, the Chinese government has argued, because the proposed changes strengthen the rights of defense lawyers while barring the practices of forcing suspects to incriminate themselves or coercing their families to testify against them. The current draft also incorporates earlier government pronouncements, including those making evidence obtained through torture inadmissible in court and limiting the use of the death penalty. China executes more people than all other countries combined, according to the London-based Amnesty International human rights group, which estimated the figure -- considered a state secret -- to be in the thousands last year. Many lawyers and legal scholars call the revisions mere window dressing. With the government more concerned about maintaining social stability in the wake of the Arab Spring unrest, they depict an increasingly repressive environment for ordinary citizens and lawyers alike. ""The authorities do whatever they want -- detention, surveillance and harassment -- it's just too arbitrary,"" said Zhang Sizhi, a prominent lawyer in Beijing who was once assigned by the government to defend Chairman Mao Zedong's widow. He and others note the draft law does not include the long-proposed right to silence for suspects or abolition of forced labor camps. Yet it does include a clause authorizing police to detain citizens for up to six months in certain cases without having to inform their families. One aspect the revisions largely ignore is the appeals process, experts say, leaving ordinary people -- like Zhang Huanzhi -- who are trying to overturn a court ruling trapped in the legal labyrinth. ""They have nowhere to go -- who will listen to them?"" said Jerome Cohen, a New York University law professor and an internationally recognized authority in Chinese law. ""It requires far more reform than this draft to address these issues."" During the just-ended month-long public comment period on the draft, the government received more than 72,000 responses. Cohen says enough negative feedback may prompt the authorities to shelve this version and start anew later. Back in Xianiezhuang Village, Zhang has heard about the proposed new criminal code and simply wishes the government would do whatever it takes to protect other families from the kind of anguish she has suffered. As she sat on a stool to winnow grains, her husband started wailing uncontrollably while reading a newspaper profile on her titled, ""A Mother's Race Against Time."" ""I've talked to my son several times on his grave,"" she said, wiping tears. ""I told him: Son, you have to fight for justice in your world and mom will keep fighting for you in mine."" ""He would thank me because he knows a mother can't live without her son.""","Nie Shubin was executed in 1995 -- when he was 20 -- for raping and killing a woman .

"Petra, Jordan (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama wrapped up his trip to the Middle East on Saturday with a walking tour of the ancient city of Petra in Jordan. The city's breathtaking architecture features buildings partly carved into stone cliffs and combines eastern culture with ancient Greek constructions. It is a UNESCO world heritage site. Obama was accompanied on a leisurely tour through Petra's steep red-rock formations by a University of Jordan tourism professor, with all other visitors kept well away -- except for a few stray cats. Soon after his stroll through the arid landscape, renowned for its colorful interplay of light and shadow, the president headed back to Washington, where he arrived Saturday night. A last-minute success . Just before departing for Jordan on Friday, Obama scored a diplomatic coup when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Turkey for a 2010 commando raid that killed nine activists on a Turkish vessel in a Gaza-bound flotilla. Israel to Turkey: Sorry for the deadly raid . The apology, long sought by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, eased strained feelings between Turkey and Israel, two vital U.S. allies in the Middle East. It happened in a phone call to Erdogan during a final meeting between Obama and Netanyahu at an international airport in Tel Aviv, minutes before Air Force One departed for Jordan to complete the president's Middle East swing. Obama hailed the development as an important step forward for both countries. Questions fly around any plan to attack Iran . Jordan's refugee influx . Friday in Jordan, Obama focused on the civil war in neighboring Syria, with King Abdullah telling reporters that the conflict has already caused 460,000 refugees to flood his country and more are on the way. That is equivalent to 10% of Jordan's population, and the total could double by the end of the year, the king said. He asked for more help from the international community as his country also deals with internal reforms in response to economic woes that are raising public dissatisfaction. Obama said he was working with Congress to provide an additional $200 million to Jordan this year to help deal with the refugee influx, but he remained steadfast in his refusal to pledge U.S. military assistance to the Syrian opposition movement. Refugees flood Jordan town . However, Obama repeated past warnings that his stance on military involvement could change if Syria uses chemical weapons. Jordan is suffering from refugee fatigue. Masses of people have fled there from neighboring countries whenever conflict was rife. The Syrian conflict comes on top of the flood of refugees that came from Iraq just a decade ago. The country is a close U.S. ally and has been one of the most stable in the region, but it has seen recent internal turmoil and discontent. King Abdullah has a reputation for benevolence, unlike autocratic rulers such as Syria's Bashar al-Assad or deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. One house of the Jordanian parliament is democratically elected. However, a weak economy and allegations of corruption by public officials have stoked dissatisfaction with him. In November, crowds took to the streets calling for King Abdullah's downfall because of rising gasoline prices. More recently, comments attributed to King Abdullah in the The Atlantic caused further anger toward the monarch, who was quoted as calling the opposition Muslim Brotherhood a ""Masonic cult"" and referring to tribal elders in his country as ""old dinosaurs."" The royal court says some of King Abdullah's comments in the magazine were taken out of context by local Jordanian and international media outlets who reported on the article. Courting Israel . In Israel, the last-minute diplomacy added a flourish to Obama's first visit to the Jewish state as president. While the two nations have a key strategic partnership, with the United States supplying military aid and diplomatic support as Israel's most vital ally, Obama and Netanyahu had famously frosty relations during the president's first term. With both beginning new terms after Obama's reelection last year and Netanyahu's recent formation of a new government, the president's visit was an opportunity to reset the relationship and signal unified positions on major issues such as the Middle East peace process and Iran's efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. Obama and Netanyahu met several times during the president's three days in Israel, which also included a state dinner where Israeli President Shimon Peres awarded him the country's highest civilian honor. Before leaving Israel, Obama paid tribute to the father of modern Zionism in a symbolic visit to Theodor Herzl's grave. Joined by Peres, Netanyahu and Kerry, Obama also visited the grave of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995. Obama placed a stone at each grave from the grounds of the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in Washington in a gesture to link the African-American struggle for freedom with the struggle by the Israeli people for a homeland. The president also visited the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, where he turned up the ""eternal flame"" of remembrance of the millions of Jewish victims of Nazi death camps in World War II. Fairness for the Palestinians . In Israel, Obama urged young Israelis in a speech to pressure their leaders to seek peace with Palestinians. He asked Israelis to empathize with the plight of Palestinians, and he drew applause when he criticized the Israeli government's controversial policy of building new settlements in disputed territories. Walking through Ramallah and Gaza, political differences become real . During a visit with Abbas in Ramallah, in the West Bank, Obama stressed the need for direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians for a two-state solution. ""The Palestinian people deserve an end to occupation and the daily indignities that come with it,"" he said at a news conference with Abbas, adding that Palestinians deserve ""a future of hope"" and a ""state of their own."" Abbas said the Israeli settlements are ""more than a hurdle to peace,"" calling them illegal and saying it was Israel's duty to stop building them. He envisioned a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders with Jerusalem as capital -- a scenario unacceptable to Israel. CNN's John King and Jessica Yellin reported Petra Jordan, and CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report from Washington. CNN's Ben Brumfield wrote the story in Atlanta.","Kerry will meet with Netanyahu and Abbas, a State Department official says .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spain on Sunday marks the eighth anniversary of the Madrid train bombings, this year embroiled in controversy over a decision by unions to hold nationwide protests over the economic crisis. Some of the usual anniversary observances will be held on Sunday to remember the 191 people killed and more than 1,800 wounded in the terrorist attacks on morning rush-hour commuter trains on March 11, 2004. But other observances, usually held on the day of the anniversary, will this year be pushed back a day, until Monday, due to the union protest. Spain's anniversary observances in recent years have been subdued, without the King or prime minister attending, and without speeches or music. Authorities have said that's in keeping with the wishes of the victims associations, who want the nation to remember but without undue fanfare. The ceremonies include placing of floral wreaths and long moments of silence. But for the first time, Spain's two main unions have scheduled dozens of protests nationwide on the anniversary and that has prompted criticism from some conservative leaders who accuse the unions of disrespect for the victims. The unions have countered that some conservatives have repeatedly shown a lack of respect for the victims -- which included many workers and students killed or maimed in the attacks -- by fomenting unfounded conspiracy theories about the bombings. Spain's two main unions -- the Socialist-leaning General Workers Union (UGT) and the Communist-leaning Workers Commissions (CCOO) -- scheduled the demonstrations on March 11 to protest against the new conservative government's labor reforms, which unions say make it cheaper and easier to fire workers. The March 11 demonstrations follow union protests last month which drew large crowds nationwide. On Friday, the unions announced a general strike for March 29. Spain's jobless rate is nearly 23 percent overall, and nearly 50 percent for youth. Nearly 5.3 million Spaniards are out of work and the government has announced deep austerity cuts. The unions said the protest in Madrid will take a different route on March 11 than the protests last month, out of respect for the victims. The route on Sunday will avoid the Atocha train station, which took the brunt of the casualties, and the emblematic Puerta del Sol square in the city center. The UGT union has announced that Pilar Manjon, a leader of the largest victims association whose son died in the attacks, will join union members at the Atocha station on Sunday morning for a memorial observance, before the protest march. Nearby, in the Retiro Park, at a grove of trees planted in honor of the victims, the Association of Victims of Terrorism will hold a memorial. But Madrid's regional government and Madrid's city hall, both governed by conservative administrations, have decided to delay until Monday their annual observances. They will include a memorial ceremony in the Puerta del Sol, followed by a memorial in the monument to the victims at Atocha station. Spanish courts already have convicted 14 Islamic militants for their roles in the train bombings, along with four Spaniards convicted for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks. Additionally, seven other prime Islamic suspects in the attacks blew themselves up three weeks after the train bombings as police closed in on their hideout in a Madrid suburb. That explosion also killed a police officer and wounded various others.","Spain on Sunday marks the eighth anniversary of the 2004 Madrid train bombings .

"(InStyle) -- Life is full of reasons to smile, but expressing joy can cause lines to form around your eyes and mouth. Luckily, you don't have to grin and bear it. Read on for tips to keep creases at bay and make skin look smoother and younger . Naomi Watts confidently flashes her radiant smile. Why wrinkles form . 1. Decreased volume . Over time, skin loses fat and produces less hyaluronic acid, a substance that retains moisture. As a result, mature skin is thinner and drier than young skin. ""Like a helium balloon the day after a party,"" says Beverly Hills dermatologist Mark Rubin, ""when skin is not filled to the same degree, you'll see crinkling on the surface."" Minimize the effects . Apply moisturizer to temporarily rehydrate (and plump up) the skin. For more help, try filler injections. 2. Loss of elasticity . As skin ages, the collagen and elastin fibers in the dermis break down, reducing skin's ability to ""snap back"" from smiles and other facial expressions. Exposure to sunlight accelerates this process, especially UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into the skin than UVB rays. Minimize the effects . Wear broad-spectrum sunblock (look for such ingredients as Mexoryl, Helioplex and avobenzone), and apply an antioxidant cream daily. To build collagen, try products with vitamin A, peptides or growth hormones. 3. Repetitive motion . Dynamic movements that cause the skin to repeatedly crease in the same place, such as smiling, will wear down the underlying tissue in that specific spot, creating a line that remains after muscles relax. Minimize the effects . Smiling is essential, but you can limit other motions that deepen crow's-feet. For example, wear sunglasses to keep from squinting in bright light. For the most dramatic results, consider Botox. Expert help for smile lines . For fast results, consider in-office procedures for trouble spots. 1. Injectable fillers . Collagen and hyaluronic acid fillers (like Restylane) can be injected directly into wrinkles to restore volume loss. Collagen is thin and more viscous, making it easier to apply under thin eye skin. By contrast, hyaluronic acid, which is denser and lasts longer, is better suited for filling the nasolabial area (the lines from mouth to nose). Primary area of use: Crow's feet and nasolabial folds . Costs: Collagen: $250--$550 per area; hyaluronic acid: $300--$850 per area . Lasts: Collagen: 3--4 months; hyaluronic acid: 6--12 months . Downtime: Swelling can last 1--2 days; some slight redness. Risks: Bumpiness and bruising . Our experience: These deep injections hurt, but our tester saw immediate improvement in nasolabial folds. She had no swelling. Insider tip: If you get a bump, massage the area within 24 hours to smooth it out. 2. Botox . Botulinum toxin, aka Botox, ""relaxes the muscles, so when you smile, the skin won't crinkle up in the area around your eyes,"" says Michigan dermatologist D'Anne Kleinsmith. Limiting repetitive movements prevents the formation of wrinkles in those areas and lessens the appearance of existing lines. Primary area of use: Forehead, brow lines and crow's-feet COST $200--$500 per area . Lasts: Approximately 3--4 months . Downtime: Virtually none, but slight swelling (that looks like a welt) may last a few hours following the injection. Risks: Drooping of the eyelid or brow (rare) Our experience: Slightly painful. It takes three to four days for dynamic wrinkles (that appear when you make facial expressions) to disappear. Insider tip: Avoid blood thinners such as ibuprofen or aspirin before treatment; they increase the risk of bruising. At-home treatments . Use topical products to look better today -- and tomorrow. Instant fix . ""Anything you can do to hydrate your skin softens the appearance of fine lines,"" says dermatologist Susan Weinkle of Bradenton, Florida. For spot treatment of wrinkles, a product with a thick, cushiony feel fills in cracks better than a thinner cream or serum. Try: Estée Lauder Perfectionist Correcting Concentrate for Deeper Facial Lines/Wrinkles. Long-term help . Nothing will turn back the clock or erase damage caused by sunbathing, but you can stimulate the production of new collagen to bolster the skin's thickness and firmness. Look for products with retinol (like Clinique) or peptides (like Olay). Try: Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream or Clinique Zero Gravity Repairwear Lift. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Look out Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal is back -- and the numbers stacking up suggest he's better than ever. After a seven-month injury layoff between July and February, the Spaniard has now won three titles since returning to the court following Sunday's 4-6 6-3 6-4 defeat of Juan Martin del Potro in the final of the Indian Wells Masters. It was the 11-time grand slam winner's 600th ATP Tour win -- Federer is the only other active player to have reached that figure -- and it helped Nadal notch up a record 22nd Masters 1000 title. The former world No. 1's triumph over Argentine Del Potro at the hard-court event also took him to 17 wins and one defeat for 2013 -- his best ever start to a season. ""A lot of things happened in the last seven months, (so) to be back here and to have this very heavy trophy with me is amazing,"" the 26-year-old told the ATP Tour's official website after his third win at the event. ""Beating three top 10 players and winning a title like this is just something unbelievable for me. I'm very, very happy and very emotional."" However after playing 18 matches in six weeks, the new world No. 4 has pulled out of next weekend's Miami Masters, though he plans to return for April's Monte Carlo Masters, where he will bid for a ninth successive triumph at the clay court event -- the Mallorcan's favorite surface. ""When you have one comeback like I'm having, you remember all the low things, lower moments that you had during those seven months,"" added Nadal. ""Hopefully I passed and can just remember all the people that really helped me a lot during all this time."" Del Potro had beaten third seed Murray and world No.1 Djokovic to reach the final, but conceded he couldn't match Nadal. ""I think Rafa deserved to win,"" said del Potro, who has lost eight of his 11 matches with Nadal. ""The last hour of the match, he played so solid and put me so far (from) the baseline and made winners. ""But I think I (had) a good tournament anyway, and Rafa played really well today in the second and third sets. He broke me early in the third. Playing against him when the score is down is tougher. I was fighting all the time but he won in the end.""","Rafael Nadal wins Indian Wells Master by beating Juan Martin del Potro .

"(CNN) -- Amid the mish-mash of potential presidential contenders at last weekend's Conservative Political Action Conference, pundit Ann Coulter didn't disappoint her supporters by brandishing once again the language of racialist politics. It was no surprise that she used immigration reform to inflame the right. She has depicted Latinos as ""a deluge of unskilled immigrants pouring into the country,"" and she'll explain to anyone who will listen that immigrants are looking for little more than the next government handout. Her deep ignorance of both the American Latino community and immigration reform is shameful. Among her fiery comments was an attack on GOP politicians Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the ""endless Bushes,"" New Jersey's Gov. Chris Christie and others who have publicly voiced support for immigration reform. Coulter alleged that Republican politicians are speaking out in favor of immigration reform because they ""panicked"" reacting to the lackluster voter support last November. And, she proudly announced, from now on she will be a single-issue voter against ""amnesty for illegals."" But just a few days later, her remarks seem especially out of touch, given the report released Monday by the GOP entitled ""Growth and Opportunity Project."" As opposed to Coulter's assessment of panic in the ranks, it seems that finally Republicans are waking up and taking a clear-eyed view to how to keep their party alive. The report prescribes an overhaul of the party, including a flat-out endorsement of immigration reform. The party, the report states, ""must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform,"" including a recommended $10 million outreach effort that includes hiring national political directors for Hispanic, Asian-Pacific and African-American voters. For the past several years, many members of the GOP have rejected any kind of immigration package that would legalize the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the United States. Some of those politicians (including Mitt Romney) have gone so far as to support state anti-immigrant laws that sought ""self-deportation,"" like Arizona's SB 1070. Drawing this type of arbitrary line in the sand against any kind of legalization proposal seriously damaged the GOP's reputation among the Latino voting bloc, which overwhelmingly supported Obama for president. Which is why the party is changing its tone. Republicans like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie are following the footsteps of Ronald Reagan in recognizing that the way to move this country forward lies in the sometimes messy, complicated task of seeking a solution to the immigration problem, not in bright-line denouncements like Coulter's sound bites. And in a significant move on Monday, tea party favorite Sen. Rand Paul, who just won the Washington Times-CPAC presidential preference straw poll, endorsed a pathway to citizenship for the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants. Contrary to what Coulter would have the CPAC audience believe, prominent Republican leaders are not panicked; they are looking for commonsense ways to tackle the broken immigration system, and have clearly stated that they are not interested in giving anyone a free pass to legalization. They've made it clear that any possible immigration package requires additional measures to secure the border, hefty fees for undocumented immigrants and a lengthy waiting period before eligible applicants are permitted to regularize their immigration status in the United States. Along these lines, on Monday, Republican members of the Senate's Gang of Eight pushed to augment the period of time that an undocumented person would have to maintain legal permanent residency before applying for citizenship. The proposal extends the current waiting period from eight to 10 years. The negotiated time frame would permit applicants to naturalize three years after gaining legal permanent residency for a total of a 13-year path to citizenship. This proposal is on par with the current citizenship process, except that it would extend the period for permanent residency and shorten the period for naturalization. This development underscores the fact that the GOP does not support a fast-track legalization plan for people who are unlawfully present in the country. Despite Coulter's assurances to the contrary, the negotiated principles that Rubio and other members of the Senate's Gang of Eight have proposed are not attempts to provide ""amnesty to illegals."" The Republicans who support the measures are not weak or desperate. Instead, they are demonstrating leadership by looking for a smart solution to a complex problem by trying to reach a fair, yet stern, deal with Democratic politicians. Coulter's smug rally to become ""single-issue voters"" smacks of panic she accuses others of experiencing. Her take on immigration is exactly the kind of ill-informed and short-sighted stance that has caused the GOP to lose supporters. She can't be pleased with the timing of the release of her own Party's report, which proclaims in no uncertain terms that immigration reform must be embraced, not dismantled. It is Ann Coulter's views that are truly out of step with the leadership and the goals of the only Party that will have her. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles P. Garcia.","Pundit Ann Coulter criticized GOP leaders about their stance on immigration reform .

"(EW) -- If second place is the first loser, then this week that's a pretty great place to be. Warner Bros.' literary adaptation ""The Great Gatsby"" stunned the industry with a magnificent $51.1 million debut. Of course, that number wasn't large enough to take down Disney's superhero sequel, ""Iron Man 3,"" which topped the box office for a second weekend with $72.5 million, but it's impressive nonetheless. Ah, the summer movie season: when films actually make money! (Provided that they're not called ""Peeples."") ""Iron Man 3,"" which had the second best opening of all time last weekend with $174.1 million, fell 58 percent in its second frame — a slimmer drop than ""Iron Man 2"" managed (59 percent) but a heftier one than ""The Avengers"" scored (50 percent). ""Iron Man 3's"" gargantuan $72.5 million weekend gave it a sizzling $17,400 per theater average from 4,253 locations and lifted its domestic box office total to $284.9 million after just 10 days. Internationally, the film is proving even more invincible. The $200 million Marvel title has now earned $664.1 million overseas, led by massive business in Asia. ""Iron Man 3′s"" top two international markets are currently China ($95.3 million) and Korea ($54.1 million), and it has become the highest grossing film of all time in both Indonesia and Malaysia. Worldwide, ""Iron Man 3"" has grossed a truly jaw-dropping $949 million, guaranteeing it will surpass $1 billion sometime this week. EW review: 'The Great Gatsby' In second place, Baz Luhrmann's roaring '20s drama took in $51.1 million — the third best opening weekend ever for a film that didn't hit No. 1. (In 2004, ""The Day After Tomorrow"" debuted with $68.7 million but trailed ""Shrek 2."" In 2009, ""Sherlock Holmes"" started with $62.3 million but couldn't overtake ""Avatar."") The glossy F. Scott Fitzgerald adaptation, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Carey Mulligan, Tobey Maguire and Joel Edgerton, broke out at the box office despite middling reviews and a ""B"" CinemaScore grade. ""This exceeded all our expectations,"" says Dan Fellman, Warner Bros.' head of domestic distribution, who claims that scheduling the adult-oriented literary drama between blockbusters like ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" helped it stand out. Indeed, ""Gatsby"" appealed to a different audience than most May action-spectacles. Whereas ""Iron Man 3"" was dominated by male viewers last weekend, ""Gatsby"" played to a core demographic of adult women. According to Warner Bros., ticket-buyers were 59 percent female and 69 percent were above the age of 25. When asked what drew those ticket buyers, Fellman says the film's Jay-Z-curated soundtrack definitely built buzz, but ultimately it came down to someone else: ""Three little letters: L-E-O."" 'The Great Gatsby' soundtrack and the rich history of the rock star composer . ""The Great Gatsby's"" marketing has relied heavily on Leonardo DiCaprio's mug — and with good reason. DiCaprio has become one of the most exciting movie stars working today without ever signing up for a major franchise or donning superhero spandex. ""Gatsby's"" healthy debut marks his second best opening weekend ever, behind only 2010′s ""Inception,"" which started with $62.8 million. Hot on the heels of ""Django Unchained,"" which wrangled $162.8 million total, DiCaprio is riding high at the box office. But ""Gatsby's"" debut also marks a career high point for Australian director Baz Luhrmann. Before this weekend, the polarizing filmmaker's best opening weekend belonged to his sweeping romance ""Australia,"" which bowed to $14.8 million in 2008. ""The Great Gatsby"" easily clobbered that figure, and it will quickly become his highest grossing film ever, surpassing ""Moulin Rouge,"" which danced its way to $57 million total in 2001. Of course, ""Gatsby"" was undoubtedly Luhrmann's most expensive project, too. The film, which was shot in 3-D, cost about $105 million to produce (and reportedly would have cost about $190 million without Australian rebates), though audiences weren't overly excited about the 3-D effects. Only 33 percent of ticket sales were for 3-D showtimes. Michael Bay's directorial effort ""Pain & Gain"" wound up in third place in its third weekend with $5 million, marking a slim 33 percent drop. The Paramount film, which stars Mark Wahlberg and Dwayne Johnson, has now earned $41.6 million against a slim $26 million budget. Shane Black and 'Iron Man 3': Who knew the 'Lethal Weapon' screenwriter would turn out to be a thrilling director? Tyler Perry's latest producing effort, ""Peeples,"" bombed in fourth place with a terrible $4.9 million from 2,041 theaters, making it the first true misfire associated with the Tyler Perry brand. The filmmaker only produced the movie (he typically writes and/or directs and/or stars in his films), but distributor Lionsgate marketed the film on his name, preceding its title with ""Tyler Perry Presents."" Fortunately, ""Peeples,"" which stars ""Scandal's"" Kerry Washington alongside Craig Robinson and David Alan Grier, only cost the studio about $15 million. Audiences issued the film an unimpressive ""B-"" CinemaScore grade. ""42,"" now in its fifth weekend, almost surpassed ""Peeples"" (and it still could once final figures are released). The $40 million Jackie Robinson biopic earned $4.7 million, bringing its total to $84.7 million so far. Along with ""Gatsby,"" ""42"" has been an encouraging performer for Warner Bros., which suffered misfires like ""Beautiful Creatures,"" ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" and ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" in early 2013. 1. ""Iron Man 3"" -- $72.5 million . 2. ""The Great Gatsby"" -- $51.1 million . 3. ""Pain & Gain"" -- $5 million . 4. ""Peeples"" -- $4.9 million . 5. ""42"" -- $4.7 million .

"New York (CNN) -- There's ""no touching"" this. ""Arrested Development"" fans can hardly wait for its sweet return on Netflix at the end of this month, so what's a few hours in line to get a photograph with the series-inspired Bluth's Original Frozen Banana stand, making its way around New York this week. Fresh from touring London, the ""popup"" stopped by Columbus Circle on Tuesday to promote season four's May 26 release on Netflix. Anyone patient enough to wait in a line stretching around Central Park West and West 61st Street was treated to a chocolate-covered frozen banana for the occasion. Actor Terry Crews, who joined the cast this season, greeted the throngs. Posing with the two actors serving the bananas, he delivered a famous line from the series: ""There's always money in the banana stand."" Like ""cutoffs"" and the ""chicken dance,"" that line stayed with fans long after it was pulled from the air in 2006. Despite its cult following, the show lasted only three seasons on Fox. And its viewers, though few, were left clamoring for more. Produced by Ron Howard, ""Arrested Development"" follows the bizarre moments shared by Michael Bluth (portrayed by Jason Bateman) and his eccentric family. The heart of the sitcom is its over-the-top characters played by Michael Cera, Will Arnett and Portia de Rossi, to name a few. New co-star Crews says his personal favorite is Lindsay Bluth, played by de Rossi. ""The Lindsay character is so pathetic in so many ways,"" he said. However, he also has a special place in his heart for Tony Hale's character, Buster Bluth. ""You really feel like they're members of your family,"" Crews said. ""And that's what makes it so funny. Because you recognize all the dysfunction, even in yourself."" Crews calls the reunion of that dysfunction a ""miracle"" and credited the ""grass-roots effort by the public and by its creator, Mitchell Hurwitz."" ""He put his whole life into bringing this show back for the fans, and Netflix provided the wonderful opportunity,"" Crews said. ""It's an iconic thing, and it's an amazing thing to watch this happen."" Crews -- a fan of the show who said he was thrilled to get the call from Hurwitz to join the revived series -- considers the release of an entire season at once to be a game-changer for the industry. ""In TV, they love standalone, 30 minutes, all-encompassing stories over (series),"" Crews explained. ""When you try to carry a story on, it's just so hard. With network television, it's almost impossible."" But thanks to Netflix, he said, ""You can tell the story as much as you want, and you can follow it as much as you want."" The actor points to the success of Netflix's original series ""House of Cards"" as proof that releasing an entire season at one time can actually fuel fans' hunger for more. And with only days remaining in ""The Final Countdown"" to ""Arrested Development,"" questions are already being raised as to what comes next. ""I think definitely the next step after this is a movie,"" Crews said, adding to Hurwitz's hints that he has tailored the new season to lead to film. ""If 'Veronica Mars' can get Kickstarted into a movie, look at what the 'AD' crew is about and what this about. We could make this happen.""","Fans in New York got a sweet way to celebrate new season of ""Arrested Development""

"Washington (CNN) -- The controversial ""drum major"" inscription on the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on the National Mall in Washington will be removed rather than replaced under a plan announced Tuesday by federal officials. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said in a news release that the move followed consultation with a ""range of stakeholders"" who concurred with the decision. Initially, plans called for the quote to be corrected. But the original sculptor, Lei Yixin, said removal was the best way to ensure the structural integrity of the memorial, the National Park Service said. The site features a commanding 30-foot statue of King, arms folded across his chest, emerging from a ""Stone of Hope."" The quote in question -- one of more than a dozen on the site -- is inscribed on one side of the stone. The abbreviated and paraphrased version of the line sparked controversy in 2011 when acclaimed poet and author Maya Angelou said it made the civil rights leader appear to be arrogant. The line reads: ""I was a drum major for justice, peace and righteousness."" In fact, King's original words, from a 1968 sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, were: ""If you want to say that I was a drum major, say that I was a drum major for justice. Say that I was a drum major for peace. I was a drum major for righteousness. And all of the other shallow things will not matter."" Opinion: We owe it to King to revise inscription on memorial . Angelou said that leaving out the ""if"" changes the meaning. The plan announced Tuesday will be submitted to the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission in January for their review, according to the Interior Department. The news release included a comment from Bernice A. King, King's youngest daughter and CEO of the King Center in Atlanta. ""We are grateful that Secretary Salazar's office and the National Park Service has taken such care to maintain the spirit and appearance of such an important monument to our country's history and my father's memory,"" she said. The memorial will remain open to visitors during the work, but some of the statue will be covered at certain times. The project will begin in February or March, after the annual King birthday observance.","Critics were unhappy with 'drum major' quote abbreviation, saying it made King sound arrogant .

"(CNN) -- I was working at my desk in D.C., following race reports from Boston on Twitter, wondering as I do every year if I'll ever be fast enough to qualify. The elite runners had long ago crossed the finish line and the back of the pack was ambling along when the door burst open and several colleagues rushed in. ""There's been a bomb at the marathon!"" My heart sank. I knew they were telling me as a journalist, but I heard it as a runner. New details, new questions in Boston . For well over a century, Boston has been hallowed ground for those of us who run. Boston is where the endless miles of training -- in rain, heat and snow -- lead. Boston is where the agony of the hills and the brutality of the stopwatch are pounded into submission by 26.2 miles of glory. It does not matter if you finish first or last. Simply being in that legendary race is the goal. Forever dreaming of it is the reality for most of us. And then, in 12 horrific seconds, a sporting event that has inspired, challenged and rewarded Americans for more than a century was turned into something awful, ugly and painful. 5 viral stories that aren't true . Make no mistake: Any decent runner in the land will tell you that nothing about the race even slightly matters compared to the suffering and grief of those people caught in the blasts. Some runners who had just covered nearly the whole course were among the first to rush over and offer aid. No matter how many years of effort they'd spent to reach the race, they knew there were real victims here, and the finish line didn't matter anymore. I have covered many explosions, massacres, wars, natural disasters and horrific accidents. I know that human loss should always trump all else. But I've also learned that sometimes other things are lost, as well, and even if they don't matter as much as the human suffering, they matter just the same. Take the pledge to run for Boston . And for so many of us who take to the roads, paths and trails, the essence of running is freedom; our freedom to step outside, stretch our legs and fly along the ground wherever we choose for as long as we please. It is a celebration of human ability and excellence. It is a struggle. It is a triumph. And this was an attack on all of that. The point of terrorism is to terrify, to drive us all away from the open roads, to force us into hiding, to make us shrink from each other and from public spaces, to make us run...away. The human spirit is still alive . I worked all day covering the blasts. I collected information on the victims, the investigation and the hunt for suspects. I checked in on friends who'd been at the race. The phone rang late as I was finally wrapping up. It was my older daughter at Georgia Tech. We marathoned together a few years back, and we still join each other for races whenever we can. ""How are you,"" I asked. ""Not great,"" she said. ""It's all so sad. I went for a run. You understand."" I do. And I know she was not alone. I know as sure as I breathe that in all the depressing, bewildering hours since the attacks, that this has been the answer from runners all across our land. They have strapped on their shoes, stepped outside and in silent tribute they have run. They have run in defiance of those who would presume upon our freedom. They have run in respect for those who died or who were hurt cheering on this silly sport we love. They have run as we've always run, to test the limits of human possibility; not to defeat others, but to improve ourselves. They have run as I will run...for Boston.","For many runners, the bombings in Boston have left a unique wound .
The peace of the road was shattered in 12 seconds of horror .

"(EW.com) -- As Jay Leno fights for his job, more people are opting to tune into the show that he's expected to lose. ""The Tonight Show"" just hit a seven-week high in total viewers with 3.52 million (his best since the week of January 28-February 1) and a four-week high in the 18-49 demo with 982,000 viewers (his best since February 18-22), according to Nielsen ratings. The ratings bump for the week of March 18-22 came as Leno began taking nightly jabs at his employers — like referring to them as snakes — as news hit that a succession plan was in the works to replace him with Jimmy Fallon. As it now stands, Leno has outranked ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" among 18-49 viewers for the last 18 weeks in a row while topping ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" for nine of their 11 head-to-head weeks. In total viewers, Leno has averaged more than the Late Show for 22 weeks in a row and ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" for 11 of 11 weeks.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 Wednesday that child rapists cannot be executed, concluding that capital punishment for crimes against individuals can be applied only to murderers. Patrick Kennedy, 43, was on Louisiana's death row after being convicted of raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter. The ruling stemmed from the case of Patrick Kennedy, who appealed the 2003 death sentence he received in Louisiana after being convicted of raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in the majority opinion that execution in this case would violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment, citing ""evolving standards of decency"" in the United States. Such standards, the justice wrote, forbid capital punishment for any crime against an individual other than murder. ""We conclude that, in determining whether the death penalty is excessive, there is a distinction between intentional first-degree murder on the one hand and nonhomicide crimes against individual persons, even including child rape, on the other,"" wrote Kennedy, who is not related to the convicted rapist.  Watch how Wednesday's ruling will have a wide reach » . Patrick Kennedy, 43, would have been the first convicted rapist in the United States since 1964 to be executed in a case in which the victim was not killed. Kennedy was convicted of sexually assaulting his stepdaughter in her bed. The attack caused severe emotional trauma, internal injuries and bleeding to the child, requiring extensive surgery, Louisiana prosecutors said. In the majority opinion, Anthony Kennedy acknowledged ""the victim's fright, the sense of betrayal, and the nature of her injuries caused more prolonged physical and mental suffering than, say, a sudden killing by an unseen assassin."" But the justice -- supported by Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer -- wrote that when determining what punishment the Eighth Amendment prohibits, ""evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society"" must be taken into account. After a review of the ""history of the death penalty for this and other nonhomicide crimes, current state statutes and new enactments ... we conclude there is a national consensus against capital punishment for the crime of child rape,"" Anthony Kennedy wrote. Attorneys at the Capital Appeals Project who represent Patrick Kennedy issued a statement applauding the ruling. ""We can only hope that the money that Louisiana has been spending drafting and defending this anomalous and unconstitutional statute will be reallocated to efforts at treatment for victims of sexual abuse and for measures that actually reduce the risk of such abuse in our communities,"" attorney Ben Cohen said in the statement. Justice Samuel Alito wrote the dissent, saying, ""The harm that is caused to the victims and to society at large by the worst child rapist is grave."" He was supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Alito also wrote that the majority ruled against the death penalty ""no matter how young the child, no matter how many times the child is raped, no matter how many children the perpetrator rapes, no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how much physical or psychological trauma is inflicted and no matter how heinous the perpetrator's criminal record may be."" Wednesday's ruling will affect six states that allow the death penalty for rape, including Louisiana, where Patrick Kennedy was recently joined on death row by another convicted child rapist, Richard Davis. Because of the ruling, the sentences of Davis and Kennedy will automatically be commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole, the Capital Appeals Project said. ""Mr. Kennedy, who has consistently maintained his innocence, plans to continue to pursue his appeals in state and federal court,"" the appeals project said. Florida, Montana, Oklahoma and South Carolina have death-penalty laws for rape but have not applied them in decades. Texas enacted a version a year ago, but no defendant has been designated death-eligible for child rape in any state but Louisiana. Other state and federal crimes theoretically eligible for execution include treason, aggravated kidnapping, drug trafficking, aircraft hijacking and espionage. None of these crimes has been prosecuted as a capital offense in decades, if ever. U.S. Supreme Court rulings in 1976 and 1977 barred capital punishment for rape. But in 1995, Louisiana passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12. State lawmakers argued that the earlier high court cases pertained only to ""adult women."" Supporters of Louisiana's law say that besides murder, no crime is more deserving of the death penalty than child rape and that the punishment would be used only in the most heinous of circumstances. ""A lot of people think there should not be a death penalty because the child survives,"" sex crimes prosecutor Kat Bartholomew said. ""In my opinion, the rape of a child is more heinous and more hideous than a homicide."" She said a sexual assault on a child ""takes away their innocence. It takes away their childhood. It mutilates their spirit. It kills their soul."" Death penalty opponents contend, among other things, that it could give attackers a reason to murder their victims. In Wednesday's ruling, Anthony Kennedy agreed, writing, ""A state that punishes child rape by death may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to kill the victim."" After the ruling, a cousin of the victim's, said, ""Just knowing the kind of man [Patrick Kennedy] is, we'll never be comfortable."" The high court has in recent years banned execution of the mentally retarded, underage killers and those deemed to have had an inadequate defense at trial. Other developments: . The U.S. Supreme Court is also expected to hear these cases: . • GUN RIGHTS -- District of Columbia v. Heller (07-290) At issue: Does a city's sweeping ban on handgun ownership violate the fundamental right to ""keep and bear arms"" by preventing individuals -- as opposed to state militias -- from having guns in their homes? Some residents want a handgun for protection in their homes, but District of Columbia officials argue they have the responsibility to impose ""reasonable"" weapons restrictions to reduce violent crime. • ENERGY PRICES -- Morgan Stanley Capital Group v. Public Utility District 1 of Snohomish County, Washington (06-1457); American Electric Power Service Corp. v. Public Utility District 1 (06-1462) At issue, with four other similar appeals: Is an energy crisis sufficient justification for federal officials to decide the standard of review for the sale of electric power contracts? A Nevada power company and a county in Washington seek to invalidate contracts because they were signed at the height of the 2000-2001 Western energy crisis. This decision may affect California's bid to save $1.4 billion on supply contracts signed at the time. • CAMPAIGN FINANCE -- Davis v. FEC (07-320) At issue: A federal law's ""millionaire's amendment,"" easing campaign spending limits for opponents of well-heeled congressional candidates who pour $350,000 or more of their money into an election cycle. Democrat Jack Davis, who ran and lost in New York's 26th Congressional District in 2004 and 2006, calls the provision an additional burden on him, requiring greater spending disclosures in a short time frame.

"(Wired) -- 2011 was supposed to be the year of the tablet. After the 2010 launch of the iPad demonstrated there was a lucrative market for consumer-class slates, all the key consumer electronics manufacturers strapped Android to their would-be iPad killers, hoping to catch up to Apple's massive lead. But Android tablets aren't selling. iPads still claim over 60% of global market share, according to IDC research. As technology web site AllThingsD claimed, ""Consumers don't want tablets, they want iPads."" And, indeed, comparably priced Android competitors haven't stood up to Apple's two tablets. Now there's a new approach: Aim low. In September, Amazon wowed us with the unveiling of its Kindle Fire tablet, the first low-priced, high-quality consumer-class tablet to look like a formidable competitor to iPad. Even if it sucks when it finally debuts this fall, at $200 the Fire is priced low enough for casual consumers to risk an impulse buy â€” and now we see other companies chasing that same price-conscious buyer. Following Amazon's lead, T-Mobile teamed up with Chinese computer company Huawei to create the SpringBoard, a sub-$200 tablet positioned to undercut the glut of other Android slates currently shipping. We got some hands-on time with the SpringBoard before it hits the shelves, and overall, it checks out well enough. I didn't expect a sub-$200 tablet to feel as substantial as the SpringBoard. It's got the look of an HTC-made slate, with a sturdy exterior casing and smooth, brushed metal finish. It's almost as if the HTC Flyer was revamped (or, perhaps, copied). Just like the Fire and the Flyer, It's a 7-inch tablet, deviating from the norm of 9- and 10-inch competitors. With the modest heft of a trade paperback, and the shape of one to boot, it's comfortable to carry. Under the hood, the SpringBoard sports a 1.2-GHz dual-core processor of yet-to-be-named pedigree. I was able to zip through Android's Honeycomb menus with relative ease, and regardless of whatever chip Huawei eventually sources for the final shipping product, it's clear that the hardware I played with wasn't skimping on core processing power. The SpringBoard comes with a few features that Amazon's Fire doesn't include: Cameras. Equipped with a 5-megapixel front-facing camera and a 1.3-megapixel back-facing camera, SpringBoard adopters can snap pictures at will. Image quality from the 5-megapixel camera is about what you would expect (i.e., nothing that would compel you to ditch a DSLR), but the very inclusion of dual cameras at least puts this tablet in the picture-taking game. That said, taking pictures with a tablet just feels weird. I've been put off by tablet-based photography since first using the Motorola Xoom and Samsung Galaxy Tab -- when shooting a pic, it feels like I'm defending myself from flying meatballs with a cafeteria tray during a food fight. Amazon decided we aren't ready for cameras on tablets (or, at least, aren't basing our buying decisions on whether cameras appear on spec sheets). Huawei thinks we are. As both tablets haven't been released, we'll have to wait on the market to see who's right. Finally, the SpringBoard offers the usual array of ports -- HDMI, micro-USB and microSD card slots (you can use microSD for an extra 32GB of storage). HDMI doesn't come standard on all tablets, so it's a nice feature. The SpringBoard is slated to go on sale ""in time for the holidays,"" says T-Mobile's spokeswoman, though the company isn't saying whether that means sooner rather than later. Though we don't know exactly how much it will cost, be prepared to spend less than two C-notes -- with a two-year T-Mobile contract, of course.

"(CNN) -- PayPal has backed off an online spat with humor blog Regretsy after getting withering Web feedback for shutting down a drive to buy holiday gifts for children in need. And the online payments service is even chipping in to help buy a few more gifts after temporarily shutting down the Secret Santa fund because the for-profit site was running it. ""(W)e can confirm that the funds have been released and we are working directly with the account holder on this matter,"" a PayPal representative said via e-mail. ""We are also making a donation to Regretsy to help families in need this holiday season. We're very sorry this occurred."" Run by actress-comedian April Winchell, Regretsy is a snarky blog created primarily to mock what it considers awkward, ugly or otherwise head-turning offerings on the arts-and-crafts site Etsy. But, perhaps in a bid for some good karma, the site maintains a charity fund that has given money to causes from breast-cancer research to Etsy community members in need. Last month, Winchell, who uses the pen name ""Helen Killer"" on the blog, put out a call for community members who knew of children at risk of not getting gifts this Christmas. On December 1, she announced that 200 children had been approved and put out a call for donations -- one that she wrote raised thousands of dollars in a few hours. ""You people make me sick,"" she wrote, mocking, as she frequently does, the tone some Etsy users take when they find their work has been featured on Regretsy. ""Funded. Overfunded, in fact. In just a few hours. We now have enough money to make gifts to the families, as well as these kids. Good job a--holes."" Then came the trouble. On Monday, Winchell wrote that PayPal, which was processing the donations, shut down the drive because she had used a ""Donate"" button that she learned is only for nonprofit groups. She said she had a ""very long and jaw-dropping conversation with an incredibly condescending representative,"" who told her she had to refund donations. She wrote she hatched a plan to return the donations, then ""sell"" the toys that had already been purchased to the donors, only to be told that, too, violated PayPal rules. PayPal said it has clear guidelines for any business that uses the service to collect donations. (The statement did not directly address whether Regretsy had violated those guidelines, saying it can't comment directly on accounts due to privacy policies). The representative said such guidelines are required by law. ""We appreciate that this can be an inconvenience, but we have a responsibility to all our customers -- both donors and recipients; or buyers and sellers,"" the PayPal rep said. ""In this instance, we recognized our error and moved as swiftly as possible to fix it."" In a post Tuesday afternoon, Winchell thanked her supporters. ""I would also like to say that I did not expect this kind of global outpouring of support, and I truly believe that had you not all made your voices heard, no one from Paypal would have ever felt compelled to make this right,"" she wrote, noting that ""Regretsy"" had become a top trending topic on Twitter. ""There is no real support or appreciation for the consumer anymore. The customer is always wrong. ""I am extremely grateful to all of you for your efforts. If Paypal is sincere about allowing us to make these gifts, you will have made a difference for 200 children and their families this holiday season."" In an email later Tuesday to CNN, Winchell said she'd had an ""encouraging"" conversation with PayPal and that they were still discussing a donation to the fund. After responding to a CNN request, PayPal's blog was updated with a post with the same statement, attributed to Anuj Nayar, director of communications.","PayPal backs off Secret Santa dispute with blog Regretsy .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's president conceded Tuesday his country may disagree with the White House at times over Iran's nuclear progress, but said he is ""free of doubts"" that U.S. President Barack Obama would use military force if necessary to stop Tehran from developing a nuclear bomb. Iran is the top issue as Obama heads here for meetings with Israeli officials, including President Shimon Peres and, more importantly, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Obama to Israel: Low expectations but lots of questions . The prime minister has at times voiced concerns Washington has a less urgent view than Israel's of Iran's progress toward developing a nuclear warhead. But he has welcomed the administration's more muscular language of late that ""all options"" are on the table and that its policy is to prevent -- not contain -- a nuclear Iran. Israeli officials took it as no coincidence that as he prepared for this trip, Obama told an Israeli TV station he believed there was still a year or so before Iran reached the final development stage -- suggesting he believes there is more time for diplomacy than the Israeli prime minister would like. On eve of Israel trip, Obama tells Iran to disarm . The Israeli presidency is a ceremonial position, but Peres is a father figure in politics here, and it was clear from his tone in the interview his overriding goal of the next few days is to project an image of close co-operation between the two allies. ""I do believe that the United States is following carefully the time and the progress,"" Peres said of the most recent Obama assessment of Iran. ""So a year is an estimation,"" Peres told CNN in an interview at his residence. ""If something were to happen earlier, I am sure we will pay attention to the change. ""The main question you asked me, and the real answer I am giving you -- I trust what the president says. I am free of doubts. I think he is a man of values. He is a man that I respect his words. And he is a man that thinks before he speaks."" Ambassador: Trip signals Obama's ties with Israel . The clear threat of military action is designed to pressure Iran to negotiate a diplomatic settlement, but some Obama critics have voiced doubt Tehran takes seriously the threat of American military action. Asked if he believed Tehran viewed the White House ""all options"" approach as serious, Peres said: ""That I am not sure. I am not sure whether the relations between Iran and the truth are so intimate. I think they are capable of bluffing others and bluffing themselves."" He played down disagreements between U.S. and Israeli intelligence assessments of Iran's progress toward a bomb. ""There may be some differences in timing, but basically we support the policy of the president of the United States,"" Peres said.","Peres believes Obama would use military force if necessary to prevent a nuclear Iran .

"New York (CNN) -- The Statue of Liberty is expected to reopen by July Fourth, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced Tuesday. The iconic landmark has been closed since October 29 due to infrastructure damage caused by Superstorm Sandy. Funding for repairs is part of $28 million allocated by the Department of Transportation to repair federal parks and recreation areas damaged by the storm in New York and New Jersey, according to a joint press release from Salazar and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York. Both the visitor and National Park Services docks at Liberty Island sustained significant damage during the storm, according to the National Parks Service. Salazar also set a July Fourth deadline in 2009 for the reopening of Lady Liberty's crown after it was closed following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.","The Statue of Liberty was closed because of Superstorm Sandy damage to the complex .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City capped off a memorable week by booking its place in the FA Cup final for the second time in three seasons. City, which defeated fierce rival Manchester United at Old Trafford last Monday, claimed a 2-1 win over Chelsea at Wembley Sunday to set up a final tie with Wigan Athletic. City last won the country's oldest and most prestigious cup competition back in 2011 when it defeated Stoke 1-0. On this occasion, Samir Nasri's first half strike and Sergio Aguero's looping header secured victory for Roberto Mancini's men in a thrilling contest against last season's European Champions League winners. Demba Ba's spectacular 66th minute strike had given Chelsea a sniff of a comeback and manager Rafael Benitez was left seething after claiming his side was denied a clear penalty. The Blues looked set to equalize when Fernando Torres raced through only to appear to be wrestled to the ground by City captain Vincent Kompany -- but the officials decided against awarding a spot kick. ""Was it a penalty? Yes clearly. Very clearly,"" Benitez told ITV. ""The penalty not being given was a key moment in the game as Vincent Kompany could also have been sent off. ""You can see the pictures. We have two situations like that in the second half. ""We played against a very good team, if they had scored another the game would have been over. ""But we keep going and we had chances to be back in the game so these decisions were very important."" Chelsea, which defeated Liverpool in last year's final, was second best for much of the contest and trailed at the break through Nasri's close range finish. Aguero's effort two minutes after interval increased City's lead before Ba's acrobatic effort ensured a frantic finale. ""It was a difficult game,"" Mancini told ITV.""The players did well to win this game, fighting for every ball until the last second. ""In the first half we had everything under control. When Demba Ba scored, it caused us a problem for 10 minutes. ""When we won the FA Cup against Stoke, it was a difficult game, and I expect the same against Wigan. ""But now we have to win the final and finish second in the championship that is our target."" Chelsea's hope of winning a trophy now rests on the Europa League where it faces a semifinal against Swiss side Basel. ""I am really disappointed with the result. When we played with Fernando Torres, the team had more energy,"" Benitez told reporters. ""If you see the performance in the second-half, the players will know they can do well in the rest of the season. You could see we had energy, quality and desire."" While City was celebrating at Wembley, its arch rival Manchester United was also reflecting on success after claiming a 2-0 win at Stoke -- a win which takes it 15 points clear at the summit of the Premier League. Robin van Persie's first goal in 10 games and Michael Carrick's opener allowed United to pick up all three points at struggling Stoke. And manager Alex Ferguson was delighted to see his star striker finally get back amongst the goals -- even if he was almost sent flying by the subsequent celebration. ""He nearly killed me! He forgets I'm 71,"" Ferguson joked. ""It was a great celebration as it brought the emotion of the players and the fans together. We really did celebrate that."" United now requires just seven points from its final six games to win the title and wrestle it back from neighbor City. Ferguson told Sky Sports: """"If we were starting the season today, with seven games left, would we fancy ourselves to win the league? That was the point of it. ""Not looking back or looking at the points we got or the goal difference. It's to start the season today. ""The players deserve all the credit for the battling performance they gave. ""The character of the team is showing. They went out on the pitch with that and got the result they deserved."" In the day's other Premier League game, Sunderland produced a memorable performance to claim a 3-0 win at fierce foe Newcastle. Manager Paolo Di Canio led the celebrations as goals from Stephane Sessegnon, Adam Johnson and David Vaughan propelled Sunderland three points clear of the drop zone. And the 44-year-old Italian took time to dedicate the victory to his late mother, who passed away exactly one year ago yesterday. Di Canio asked reporters: ""Can I tell you something? ""Sometimes, some special things have to remain inside yourself. It's not good to share with others because it's very deep inside yourself. ""But I believe in this thing. Before the kick off, I saw the face of my Mama smiling. Exactly yesterday, it was one year since she passed away. ""Exactly one year ago, there was the same situation. I was in the dug-out the day after she passed away and we won the game -- I was at Swindon -- and today, it has happened again. ""For this, I have to thank not only my Mama, otherwise my Dad - he is next to her, but today, he is going to be upset. ""But Dad, Mama was special today, so my dedication goes to her today, to my Mam."" In Spain, league leader Barcelona cruised to a 3-0 win at Real Zaragoza with two goals from Cristian Tello and a strike from Thiago Alcantara doing the damage. Barca sits 13 points clear of Real Madrid, which also won 3-0 with two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and a strike from Gonzalo Higuain seeing off Atheltic Bilbao. Meanwhile, Radamel Falcao scored twice as third place Atletico Madrid cruised to a 5-0 win over Granada, while Real Sociedad's Imanol Agirretxe kept his side's push for Champions League football on track. Agirretxe scored both goals as Sociedad overcame Rayo Vallecano 2-0 to open up a four point gap between itself and fifth place Malaga. In Italy, third-place Milan drew 1-1 with second place Napoli in a result which does neither team any good in their pursuit of league leader Juventus. Mathieu Flamini gave Milan a 30th minute lead only for Goran Pandev to equalize three minutes later. Flamini was later sent off with 18 minutes to go but Napoli was unable to force a winner and remains in second, nine points off the top. Elsewhere, Inter Milan suffered a 2-0 defeat at Cagliari as it slumped to a third loss in four games. Mauricio Pinilla scored twice to leave Inter's hope of qualifying for next season's Champions League in jeopardy. Ten-man Roma picked up all three points at Torino courtesy of a 2-1 victory. Pablo Osvaldo and Erik Lamela got the goals before Federico Balzaretti was sent off after receiving a second yellow card. Elsewhere, Udinese eased to a 3-0 win at Parma, while Palermo finished 1-1 against Bologna, Chievo finished goalless against Catania and Genoa drew 1-1 with Sampdoria.","Manchester City defeated Chelsea 2-1 in the FA Cup semifinal at Wembley .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An inmate who died in an Israeli prison was ""found hanging in the shower of his security cell,"" a court document released Tuesday said, the latest detail to filter out of Israel in what has become known as the ""Prisoner X"" case. Read more: Israel to investigate arrest, death of 'Prisoner X' The news emerged after an Israeli court lifted part of a gag order on the case. The document detailing the manner of death said that a sheet connected to the window of a bathroom was tied around his throat. The case has stirred interest across the world. The fate of the man dubbed ""Prisoner X"" is now the subject of an investigation by Israel's parliament. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pleaded over the weekend for details to be kept quiet, warning ""overexposure of security and intelligence activity"" could harm Israel's security.

Zygier reportedly committed suicide in Israel's Ayalon Prison in December 2010, about 10 months after his arrest, according to ABC. His incarceration was a state secret, and Israel has never confirmed the prisoner's name or how he died. ABC, citing unnamed sources, reported Tuesday that Zygier gave Australia ""comprehensive detail about a number of Mossad operations, including plans for a top-secret mission in Italy that had been years in the making."" Zygier helped Mossad set up a European communications company that sold electronics to Arab countries and Iran, according to the network. He met with Australian intelligence during a trip back to Australia, ABC reported. It wasn't clear who approached whom -- but ABC said it ""believes"" Zygier was arrested after Mossad discovered his contact with ASIO, fearing he had given up Israeli secrets. In a statement Tuesday, Netanyahu's office stressed that Zygier ""never had any connection with the security and organizational services of Australia.""

"London (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth II is to head below ground Wednesday with Prince Philip and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground. The royals are visiting central London's Baker Street station -- a stone's throw from the home of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's legendary fictional detective Sherlock Holmes at 221B Baker Street. The queen was forced to cancel some visits last week because she was experiencing symptoms of gastroenteritis. Once below the surface, the royal party will view a restored underground coach dating back to 1892 and talk to the people involved in bringing it back to its former glory. They will then walk through a new S7 train, which will be officially named ""Queen Elizabeth II"" after the monarch. The royals will also meet the head of London Underground and other transport officials. The London Underground celebrated 150 years in January since the first passengers traveled underground between Paddington and Farringdon on the Metropolitan Railway. The Tube, as the Underground is known, is a big part of Londoners' life, with more than 1 billion journeys made each year on its network. The royals will also meet with representatives of the Railway Children charity, which works to help vulnerable children who live alone and at risk on the streets. Prince William's wife Catherine is expecting their first baby in July. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.","The queen, Prince Philip and Catherine visit Baker Street station .

"(CNN) -- The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. would hardly recognize America in 2013, the 50th anniversary year of his world-famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. The efforts of King and countless others have not only made it possible for Barack Obama to become the first black president of the United States, but also created unprecedented opportunities for the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, and virtually anyone who had previously been given a check that has, as King put it, ""come back marked 'insufficient funds.'"" I personally cannot think of MLK Day without reflecting on my life as a product of post-civil rights America: I was conceived on the coattails of that movement to a single mother, absent father, horrific poverty, and despair and fear I would not wish upon anyone. Yet here I am, a direct beneficiary of King's legacy. I do not take the opportunities given to me lightly. Especially since my mother, born in South Carolina in the Jim Crow-era, has sickening memories of the racial oppression back in those days. Her family had no electricity, no indoor running water and no television. The day that King delivered his ""I Have a Dream"" speech, my mother turned 20. ""We knew there was colored folks marching in Washington,"" my mother told me. ""We just did not know what for exactly."" The what for had everything to do with democracy, freedom, voting and citizenship rights, for a group longed blocked from the doors of the American dream. It means the only way we could ever come to ""a beautiful symphony of brotherhood"" that King spoke of is for each of us, no matter our background, to honor and recognize who we are, including very uncomfortable parts of our history, like slavery, which was depicted in recent films like Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Django Unchained."" We cannot sit at the table of diversity and multiculturalism if we are not even clear what we are bringing to share. In King's speeches and writings in the last years of his life, he wanted people, including black people, to embrace and appreciate their culture and heritage. But it was never an either or for him. King worked for and loved Black America, and he worked for and loved America. From 1963 to the present, the United States has changed dramatically. When I attended integrated schools, I remember sitting elbow to elbow with children of different races, something my mother could not have fathomed in her childhood dominated by ""Whites Only"" and ""Coloreds Only"" signs everywhere. But the work is far from over. I think King would be saddened that the poverty and economic disparities he fought against at the end of his life are still here. He would be outraged by the kind of racism that routinely profiles young black and Latino males and fills our nation's prison system with black and brown bodies. He would be awestruck and angered by the visionless black leadership that has come to dominate black communities nationwide, more concerned with media moments and money than solutions. He would wonder how black culture has deteriorated from Harry Belafonte, Motown and Nina Simone to Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, and reality TV shows that present utterly destructive black images. I think he would be disheartened by the numerous wars that have occurred since Vietnam and by the fact that more than one million Americans have died by gun violence since he himself was shot and murdered in Memphis on April 4, 1968. And moreover, he would be very outspoken about how some Americans treat immigrants, and our inability to see their plights as great civil rights issues of our time. But, King would smile broadly, in that way he did, as we witnessed the stunning rainbow coalition of Americans who voted Barack Obama into office in 2008, as a direct extension of King's prophetic dream. Despite the historical significance of electing Barack Obama into the Oval Office twice, and the great victories we accomplished together as a nation in the past 50 years, King would urge us to continue his work since a lot more needs to be done. The harsh reality is that Martin Luther King Jr. is never coming back. We have a federal holiday dedicated to him, we have the moral authority of his spoken and written words, and we have his mighty spirit hovering over our nation like an uninterrupted sheet of light. But I sincerely believe that if we are going to live up to the extraordinary vision of King, then we must open our hearts more to each other, as sisters and brothers, as part of the human family. We know, as he knew, that love must be a living and breathing thing. In celebration of his legacy, let's keep in mind that service to others must become as natural to us as breathing, for the good of America and for the good of all of us.

"(CNN) -- By now the story has become familiar, though it's no less gut-wrenching: A grown man is accused of hurling a racial insult at a crying toddler on an Atlanta-bound flight and then slapping the child when he won't quiet down. Joe Rickey Hundley of Idaho has been charged with assaulting 19-month-old Jonah Bennett and has lost his job. Hundley turned himself in to authorities on Tuesday and was released on bail. His first court appearance has not been set. Hundley's attorney, Marcia Shein, said her client is being unfairly portrayed. A good deal of the conversation surrounding the incident involves the fear that the youngster may be ""traumatized forever."" How likely is it that little Jonah will remember this incident or be affected by it long-term? Not very likely, according to experts. ""He may remember it for a while, and he may be fearful, but a one-time experience won't have a long-term effect,"" said Atlanta pediatrician Dr. Jennifer Shu. According to Shu, who has not treated the toddler, Jonah is too young to understand what is going on. The incident was shocking in the moment, says Shu. The toddler understands the slap and knows that someone hit him and that it hurt. But he doesn't know or comprehend the significance of what happened. Nor would he understand the meaning if ugly words were directed at him. Dr. Theodore Gaensbauer, clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and author of the study ""Emotional Expression in Infancy,"" agrees. ""I would not say it will cause lifelong trauma, depending on how it's handled,"" observed Gaensbauer, who is a national expert on preschool trauma. The experience may, however, create a vulnerability for a period of time, perhaps months or up to a year or so. If something else happens that is reminiscent -- such as being subject to racially charged slurs and violence similar to the alleged incident -- he may be more vulnerable. Early childhood trauma is certainly a cause for concern. Dr. Rajita Sinha, director of the Yale Stress Center, told me last year that stressful experiences can effectively rewire the brain to respond to hardship by becoming more sensitized to stress. That is, the child becomes hard-wired to react much more strongly than someone who did not experience a lot of turmoil. As a result, the child may go on to have a permanently elevated level of stress, with its adverse implications for physical and psychological health. But challenging situations, even one as dramatic as the one little Jonah Bennett experienced, do not necessarily lead to lifelong issues. Sinha observed that it's stress that is sustained, uncontrollable and overwhelming that is damaging. ""It is hard to be resilient that often,"" said Gaensbauer, who also has not examined Jonah Bennett. But even then, protective factors like social and family support, education and optimism and emotional self-regulation can provide a safety net for children. Both Shu and Gaensbauer observe that most children can work through and overcome a single traumatic episode without any obvious long-term effects, given supportive parenting and caretaking. ""How secure is the child's relationship with his caregivers?"" Shu asked. If he's had good relationships and solid attachments, that will make him more able to deal with traumatic situations like this. On the other hand, if he's had a lot of stress in his life already, it may make it harder. What's really important is how Jonah's family is dealing with the incident. Shu says that if the family is calm and reassuring, the child will be comforted by that. If they are stressed out and expressing their anxieties, particularly within the toddler's earshot, he is likely to respond by becoming stressed as well. After traumatic incidents, Gaensbauer always recommends that caregivers look out for subtle signs that children may be adversely affected: ""Things like increased clinginess, bed-wetting or separation anxiety. He may need to be closer to his parents. He may have trouble sleeping, may be more hyper. Noises may make him fearful."" The child may even hit others, cautions Gaensbauer. And in such an instance, it's important that parents do not react punitively or generalize in terms of their child being more aggressive. ""What he's doing is imitating and reenacting what he experienced, in an attempt to understand it."" Gaensbauer suggest that play therapy may be useful. Caregivers can use dolls, play materials and toy airplanes to create a scene that helps the child to conceptualize and develop a narrative around what happened. Over and above providing reassurance and empathy, caregivers need to help children understand that the experience was unique, ""so they're not living with this undercurrent of anxiety that no matter where I am, suddenly, for reasons I don't understand, something terrible can happen, and someone can come along and hurt me."" It's important to make the unconscious conscious, within the bounds of children's understanding, says Gaensbauer. At age 2, a child does not understand what happened, but with the wisdom, care and support of his loved ones, over time, he will.","Joe Rickey Hundley is accused of slapping 19-month-old Jonah Bennett on a flight .

"Washington (CNN) -- Tourists and businesses are already feeling the sting of federal budget cuts, with officials in Wyoming announcing delays for opening parts of Yellowstone National Park. The National Park Service is taking a $113 million hit under the so-called government sequester that took effect on Friday and is set to run through the end of the current fiscal year unless Congress calls it off or changes how it is implemented later this month. The impact on the overall federal budget and deficit reduction is miniscule, but the meaning of cuts to local businesses in and around treasured landmarks that host nearly 300 million visitors a year is all too real. House GOP campaign arm goes online in the blame game over forced spending cuts . The National Mall and the Statue of Liberty will be affected, according to John Garder, budget and appropriations legislative representative for the National Parks Conservation Association. The Mall stands to lose $1.6 million and the Statue of Liberty almost $780,000 between now and the end of the fiscal year in September. Local government officials and business leaders in Cody, Wyoming, said Yellowstone will delay the opening of its north and west entrances by a week until April 26, and its east, south and northeast entrances by two weeks until mid-to-late May because of the impact of budget cuts on snow removal. The delay will cost related businesses several million dollars, the local Chamber of Commerce said. Jan Stoddard, marketing director for the West Yellowstone, Montana, Chamber of Commerce said the park and its visitors are the lifeblood of her community. ""Limiting access to the park even for a few weeks can have significant impacts on the bottom line of a small business reliant on those visitors,"" Stoddard said. ""These visitors contribute tax dollars and support jobs."" So what are these cuts actually worth? The Park Service operates on $2.2 billion annually, or a tiny fraction of the federal budget. But its sites pump $31 billion into local economies and visitation has been up despite a sluggish economy. Opinion: Americans sick of budget soap opera . National parks contribute more than 270,000 jobs outside the National Park Service like lodging, food and beverage services, and recreation and entertainment. ""It is important to note that proposed cuts to Yellowstone and Glacier national park budgets will save the federal government $2.5 million, but in all likelihood tax losses due to reduced tourism could offset the savings. Last year, nonresident tourism to Montana generated approximately $253 million in federal taxes,"" Stoddard said. According to Forbes, eight of the top 25 U.S. tourist destinations are national parks. In a memo, the National Park Service outlined some of the more specific changes and closures that would be attributed to the proposed spending cuts. For instance, Gettysburg National Park, which honors the famous Civil War battle, would eliminate 20% of its spring student education programs, affecting 2,400 students. Grand Canyon National Park will reduce hours of operation at the main visitor center, affecting at least 250,000 people. The White House said, ""Many of the 398 national parks across the country would be partially or fully closed"" during the six months of budget austerity and other parks would experience shorter hours, fewer employees and limited camping and hiking spaces. It will take a month or so for the cuts to kick in at most federal agencies. Share your story: How do you feel about the cuts? In the 2011 fiscal year, funding for the National Park Service was cut by almost $140 million. From 2002 to 2011, the budget fell by 13% overall. According to Garder, recent cuts have taken a toll, with deferred maintenance requests running into the billions of dollars. In the long term, Garder fears further cuts could have a detrimental effect on the vitality of national parks, including limited resources for ""curbing invasive species and long term protection (of park areas)."" Areas managed directly by the National Park Service won't be the only ones to experience the pain of spending restrictions. The Three Bear Lodge and Restaurant in West Yellowstone will feel it, too. ""Because of the seasonality of our business and the fact that our town of West Yellowstone basically shuts down whenever Yellowstone closes, we need revenue generated every day in order to stay solvent on a year-round basis,"" owner Clyde Seely said. ""Opening our businesses for shorter time periods or causing reductions in visitation during the shoulder seasons of the park will cause proportionate reductions in the overall economy."" Zakaria: Cuts a damning indictment of Washington . Almost 279 million people visit national parks each year. Visitor concessions like souvenir shops, lodging, transportation, equipment rental and food services will suffer from the decrease in tourism caused by the limitation in park hours. ""There is a breaking point and once we reach that and services begin to suffer, this will be directly reflected in the experience our visitors are having and that poses the greatest danger -- when we can no longer deliver on the promised experience,"" Stoddard said. But economist Isabelle Sawhill from the Brookings Institution said cuts in cases like this aren't that significant. ""I think almost any organization can sustain a 5% cut in their budget and not have it interfere with their basic mission,"" she said. Garder disagreed. ""The budgeting process is completely broken. It's Congress' job to figure out where investments should be made and where agencies should be cut, it's a mindless process and it's not meant to become policy. Beyond spending cuts: What's next for Washington .","Forced spending cuts to trim $113 million from park service budget .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A judge warned actress Lindsay Lohan Wednesday that the only way she can avoid jail on a theft charge is to be acquitted in a trial. ""If you plead in front of me, you are going to jail, period!"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Keith Schwartz told Lohan during a hearing. The prosecutor offered Lohan a plea deal Wednesday, but the terms of the offer were not disclosed. ""I get the impression you're not going to accept the DA's offer,"" Schwartz said. Lohan lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley previously said her client would welcome a plea deal, but only if it did not involve jail time for the actress. ""Ms. Lohan maintains her innocence, and now that I've seen the police reports, I believe the case is entirely defensible,"" Holley said after the initial hearing. ""Having said that, we will entertain a discussion concerning a plea if it means no jail so that she can move forward with her recovery and her career."" If Lohan is convicted on the felony grand theft charge, her ""ability at that time to have more input in the sentence could be lessened,"" the judge told Lohan Wednesday. She will appear before Judge Schwartz again March 10, but if a plea deal is not reached by then the case will go to another judge for a preliminary hearing and a possible trial, he said. Wednesday marked Lohan's eighth court appearance in nine months, events that have spawned an atmosphere outside the court similar to the red carpet arrivals she used to enjoy before her acting career was derailed by her legal problems and stints in rehab. Her entrance for the February 9 hearing, in which she entered a not guilty plea to the felony grand theft charge, caused a media stir because she was wearing a tight-fitting white knit dress and diamond jewelry that would have been appropriate for a movie premiere. Her apparel Wednesday was more conservative. Lohan, 24, wore cream-colored slacks and a black top, but she was walking in 5-inch black platform stilettos. Lohan and her lawyer have new information in hand to help with her decision about a plea deal. The prosecution handed over all of the police reports and a copy of the jewelry store surveillance video that allegedly shows the actress leaving with a $2,500 necklace without paying on January 22. The felony grand theft charge triggered a charge that she violated her probation for a 2007 drunk driving conviction. Lohan is free on bond on the probation violation and the grand theft charge while her lawyer and the prosecutor discuss a plea deal, or until a full hearing. The penalty for a felony grand theft conviction ranges from 16 months to three years in a California state prison. The exact term would be based on the value of the property stolen and the criminal record of the defendant. Shoplifting offenses are charged as petty theft if the property taken is valued at less than $950. The store owner claims the ""one of a kind"" necklace is worth $2,500, police said. The judge could reduce the charge to a misdemeanor, which would carry a prison sentence of no more than one year. The allegedly stolen necklace was handed over to police just before they were to execute a search warrant to look for the jewelry in Lohan's Venice apartment, police said. The actress is on supervised probation for a drunken driving conviction. The judge overseeing that case told her in October that he would send her to jail for 180 days if she violated her probation rules before her next court appearance, set for February 25. That court date is now off, with Schwartz taking over Lohan's legal cases. She left the Betty Ford clinic a month ago after three months in a drug rehabilitation program. The rehab stint persuaded the judge not to send Lohan to jail for failing a drug test.","NEW: The judge tells Lohan if she pleads, ""you are going to jail, period!""

"Washington (CNN) -- What's wrong with the ""Gang of Eight"" comprehensive immigration reform bill? Jeff Sessions has a lot of answers to that question, but he starts by pointing to a picture of a modest white house built in the early 1930s in Hybart, Alabama. ""I grew up in rural Alabama, in a poor area of the state,"" the three-term Republican noted during a recent interview in his Washington office. ""We didn't have central heat, but we got by. And people (still) do."" But ""we've got a serious social and economic problem in America,"" the conservative senator said. ""We've got high unemployment among lower skilled workers, and their wages aren't even keeping up with inflation."" Adding millions of newly legalized workers to the mix over the next few years will only hurt the most vulnerable segments of the work force, Sessions said. Specifically, he argued that in granting work authorization for millions of undocumented men and women over the next decade and beyond, the bill will benefit corporate titans by flooding the labor market and holding down stagnant salaries in an already weak economy. In short, it will lead to disaster for those Americans now clinging to the bottom rung of the economic ladder. It's a populist argument not often heard in the higher echelons of today's GOP. ""My Republican colleagues seem to be oblivious to the free market,"" Sessions said. Sessions recently sat down with CNN to discuss his role in leading the charge against the 844-page overhaul of the country's immigration laws. He is by far the Senate's toughest critic of the bill -- crafted by four Democratic and four Republican colleagues -- as it winds its way through the Democratic-controlled Senate. He offered almost 50 amendments to the Judiciary Committee and is trying to derail the bill at nearly every turn. His office sends out daily -- sometimes hourly -- alerts highlighting various perceived flaws in the measure. The proposal ""does not hold up to scrutiny,"" he insisted. ""We're going to tell the truth about the bill. We're going to expose it."" Sessions is not new to this debate. During President George W. Bush's second term, he helped kill a proposed bipartisan immigration overhaul pushed by Sens. Edward Kennedy and John McCain. Like President Barack Obama now, Bush made immigration reform a second term priority. Back then -- as now -- reform backers highlighted the glut of undocumented workers doing the toughest jobs on America's farms and elsewhere. Sessions is still irritated by a statement Bush made in 2006 that reform is needed because ""there are jobs that just simply aren't getting done because Americans won't do them."" ""When President Bush said that there were certain jobs Americans won't do, I consider it to be one of the greatest errors in his entire presidency,"" Sessions said. ""Americans are doing tough work every day. They ought to be respected for it. They shouldn't be looked down for it. And we need their salaries going up."" Some immigration reform proponents insist there's no way to truly lock the border down if there's a strong enough economic incentive to come to United States. Sessions, however, insists the border can be fully secured, and that it was headed in that direction before Obama took office in 2009. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton have overseen an ""evisceration of internal enforcement,"" he said, flatly contradicting White House claims. If changes made at the end of Bush's term ""had been followed up on, we could have already had the border substantially secure."" ""A nation that pretends to have a lawful system of immigration has to be willing to execute that,"" Sessions said, noting that bitter opposition of the ICE agents' union to the ""Gang of Eight"" bill. It requires ""a certain effort and consistency that's been lacking."" Among the many flaws in the ""Gang of Eight"" bill, according to Sessions, is a diminution of accountability standards along the border. He rails at a decision made by the authors of the bipartisan legislation to ignore a 1996 requirement for the use of biometrics -- such as fingerprints -- for visa holders at all entry and exit points. Democrats and others call the standard -- which was never enacted -- unrealistic and prohibitively expensive. Sessions introduced an amendment withholding citizenship from any undocumented worker until its complete enactment, but the proposal was voted down by the Judiciary Committee in a 12-6 vote. The panel's 10 Democrats were joined by Republicans Jeff Flake of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both members of the ""Gang of Eight."" Flake and Graham have been working with the panel's Democratic majority to prevent any major changes to the bill. ""Everybody needs to know it -- who's calling the shots,"" Sessions said at one recent committee meeting. Sessions also takes aim at language in the bill swapping the existing E-verify system -- an Internet-based program used to check the legal status of potential employees -- with a new one that relies more strongly on photographic matches through passport and driver's license images, among other things. Supporters insist the new version will be more effective, but Sessions says it's unproven and offers too much discretion to the Department of Homeland Security. It ""could be an improvement"" but ""it's dangerous the way (the provision) is written,"" the senator argued. ""I'm wondering why they want to go around and create a new one."" Beyond disputes over specific provisions, Sessions makes what he characterizes as a broader moral argument against the proposal. ""I will not support citizenship for people who entered the country illegally,"" Sessions said. ""There needs to be some difference between what we do for a person who enters the country legally and those who enter illegally. ""And there's no moral, no legal, no principled reason why this United States government should reward people who broke the law and entered the country illegally with every benefit that you give to somebody who comes lawfully."" The bill as currently written ""just further incentivizes amnesties in the future,"" he argued, invoking one of the most bitterly contested terms of the debate. While the Republican Party may be divided over immigration reform, analysts are not surprised by Sessions' role as leader of the Senate opposition. ""Given the politics of Alabama, it doesn't surprise me at all,"" said Richard Fording, chairman of the University of Alabama's political science department. ""Politics here dictates you oppose whatever the president supports."" Fording noted Alabama's passage in 2011 of one of the strictest laws in the country designed to crack down on undocumented immigration. Among other things, the law requires police who make lawful traffic stops or arrests to try to determine the immigration status of anyone they suspect might be in the country illegally. The law retains broad support in Alabama, Fording said, even crossing the state's traditional racial divide. ""There's nothing for Sessions to lose and maybe lots to gain"" in opposing the ""Gang of Eight"" bill, Fording said. As for political considerations on Capitol Hill, Sessions told CNN the ""Gang of Eight"" put its blueprint together using an ""old fashioned, smoke-filled room strategy."" As a result, he says, the bill was written by big labor and business interests. ""I've been around here a long time,"" he said. ""I've never seen a more calculated, cold-blooded p.r. campaign managed to advance a piece of legislation than this one."" ""The political consultants and pollsters and people (managing the bill) ... anticipated everything that was going to occur,"" he declared. ""They planned on careful attacks to neutralize critics."" ""But somebody needs to ask questions about this bill,"" he quickly added. ""They don't get to write a bill in secret, and we all roll over and have it passed without examination."" And what about the argument that by opposing comprehensive immigration reform, Republicans risk permanently alienating America's rapidly growing Hispanic population? Sessions returns to his economic theme. ""I believe that, politically, at this point in time we should serve and listen to the concerns of the working Americans who are making $20,000 to $45,000 a year,"" Sessions said. ""That includes Hispanics, African-Americans, and Caucasians,"" he noted. ""One of the reasons their wages haven't gone up is because there's too much labor. And so, if we end the illegality with a good, principled immigration bill, (if) we allow a generous but responsible flow of immigrants in the future, and if we improve the lives of working Americans, then that's the way you win elections.""","Alabama GOP Sen.

"Washington (CNN) -- Politics is full of second chances. Mark Sanford is living proof. Now Anthony Weiner is hoping to travel the same route in seeking political redemption. Weiner was in his seventh term in Congress, representing parts of the New York City boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn, when he resigned from the House in 2011 amid scandal over lewd photos sent via Twitter. Weiner talked about his controversy in a video that went up online early Wednesday where he announced his candidacy for mayor of New York City. ""Look, I made some big mistakes, and I know I let a lot of people down. But I've also learned some tough lessons. I'm running for mayor because I've been fighting for the middle class and those struggling my entire life. And I hope I get a second chance to work for you."" The video also features his wife, Huma Abedin, a former top adviser to Hillary Clinton, and their young son. Later in the video, Abedin says ""we love this city, and no one will work harder to make it better than Anthony."" Sound familiar? Flash back a few months to Mark Sanford, another well-known politician looking for a second chance. Sanford's political career was left for dead following an infamous affair, but he made a bid for political redemption, running in a special election to fill a vacant congressional seat. Sanford succeeded in his comeback by winning this month's election and is again representing South Carolina's 1st Congressional District, a seat he once held before he became governor. Sanford talked about his affair in his first campaign commercial. Most special elections for a vacant House seat don't grab national attention, but thanks to Sanford (and his Democratic opponent being the sister of Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert), the race was in the headlines. The media loves a comeback story, if only because it allows them an opportunity to revisit what brought down that politician in the first place. So Weiner, like Sanford, will be in the spotlight, for better or for worse. ""Voters love a good comeback story. We identify with the underdog and cheer for him as we would for ourselves,"" says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. ""But voters also love justice. We want people to pay for their mistakes. Anthony Weiner hasn't yet paid for his. He probably will in this election. But who knows?"" ""Anthony was of the most talented politicians in either party, and this race is going to be steep climb for any of the candidates. Anthony definitely has a shot,"" says a Democratic strategist who's worked in New York City politics. ""When you have someone as skillful as a messenger as Anthony, that makes a big difference in a race where TV ad spending is limited due to New York City election laws and the fact that it's the most expensive media market in county,"" adds the strategist, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely. The big question is what the voters think. As of now, nearly half of New York City voters don't think Weiner should run for mayor this year, according to a new poll. According to a Quinnipiac University survey, which was conducted in the week before Weiner's announcement and released Wednesday, 49% of New York City voters said Weiner should not run for mayor, with 38% saying he should make a bid and 12% unsure. The 49% figure is up five percentage points from a Quinnipiac poll conducted in mid-April. The survey indicates Democratic voters are divided, with 41% saying Weiner should run and 44% disagreeing. But Weiner's entry into the race finds him in the second spot for his party's nomination, according to the poll, with 15% of registered Democrats saying they would vote for Weiner if the primary were held today. City Council Speaker Christine Quinn remains in the top spot, at 25%. Quinn has long been the Democratic front-runner in the race, and if she's elected in the November general election, she'll become Gotham's first female and first openly gay mayor. The other Democratic candidates are at 10% or less in the survey, with more than a quarter of voters undecided. The poll also indicates that at this stage in the campaign, the eventual Democratic nominee would be the front-runner in the November election.","Former Rep.

"Pretoria, South Africa (CNN) -- Olympic and Paralympic runner Oscar Pistorius on Sunday canceled his appearance in five upcoming races, days after being charged with murder in the shooting death of his girlfriend in South Africa. The move is meant to help Pistorius focus on the legal proceedings and ""help and support all those involved as they try to come to terms with this very difficult and distressing situation,"" said Peet Van Zyl of Pistorius' management company, In Site Athlete Management. The Valentine's Day shooting has stunned South Africa, where Pistorius is a national hero. Universal admiration for his sports achievements turned to shock, and with only scant details being made public, the questions are swirling. What transpired in Pistorius' upscale Pretoria home? What led to the killing of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, a platinum-haired model gearing up for her reality television debut? And why on Valentine's Day? In a packed courtroom in Pretoria, the man nicknamed ""Blade Runner,"" for his lightning-fast prosthetic legs, held his head in his hands and wept. His loud sobs shook his body uncontrollably. ""As you can imagine our entire family is devastated, we are in a state of total shock,"" said his uncle, Arnold Pistorius, in a written statement. ""All of us saw at first hand how close she had become to Oscar during that time and how happy they were."" ""We have no doubt there is no substance to the allegation and that the State's own case, including its own forensic evidence, strongly refutes any possibility of a premeditated murder or indeed any murder at all."" Pistorius, 26, also rejected the murder allegation ""in the strongest terms,"" his agent said in a statement. 'Medals are just medals' But Saturday, two days after Steenkamp's death, some South Africans remained puzzled over his alleged involvement. Despite the fact that he is innocent until proven guilty, some said the allegation has tainted his image. ""I was very shocked. A mother lost a daughter. I was not expecting anything like this from someone like him,"" said Nondumiso Mlondo, who lives in Durban. ""Everybody is still talking about it. Just think of those young kids who want to be like him, who are looking up to him. After his Olympic success, we were hoping for something bigger for him this year ... look what has happened."" Citizens carried on heated discussions in buses, bars, barber shops. ""People are saying .. why do stars make a point of screwing up when they are doing so well?"" Mlondo asked. ""Medals are just medals ... I don't care whether he has hundreds of them, he should be held accountable."" Opinion: Pistorius case and the plague of violence against women . 'Life goes on' But for others, the shock was ebbing. ""Life goes on,"" said Rufaz Mavhure, who lives in Woodmead, a commercial suburb of Johannesburg. ""It was a shock to the nation when we first heard it ... but it has worn off,"" he said. ""We have sobered up -- even though people will still question why."" The allegation was a major fall from grace for a man who made history last year by becoming the first double-amputee runner to compete in the able-bodied Olympic Games in London. Meanwhile, South Africa's national broadcaster aired a reality TV show featuring Steenkamp discussing her exit from the taped program, on which she was a contestant. ""I'm going home with sort of a sweet taste in my mouth. I don't have any regrets. I don't have any bitterness,"" she said. ""I'm going to miss you all so much and I love you very very much."" The decision to air the program took ""much deliberation,"" and that ""this week's episode will be dedicated to Reeva's memory,"" Executive producer Samantha Moon said. A fallen hero . When Pistorius was 11 months old, his legs were amputated below the knees because he was missing the fibulae in his legs. He runs on special carbon fiber blades, hence the nickname. A few weeks after the Olympics, he smashed a record to win the men's 400-meter in the 2012 Paralympic Games. Images of his sports feats flashed across the screens at the time. But by Thursday, it was a jarringly different story. Pictures of his walk to a police car, his head covered by a sweatshirt, flashed across television screens worldwide. Then there was his court appearance 24 hours later, grim-faced and sobbing uncontrollably. Prosecutors planned to upgrade the charge to premeditated murder. Nike's bullet ad with Pistorius backfires . A nation, jolted . Steenkamp's killing rattled South Africa, which is grappling with the aftermath of the recent murder of 17-year-old Anene Booyson -- a case that has put a spotlight on violence against women. Booyson died after she was gang-raped and mutilated in Bredasdorp, a tiny tourist town southeast of Capetown. While police have not discussed a possible motive for the 29-year-old model's killing, local media reported that Pistorius had mistaken his girlfriend for an intruder. But South African authorities stressed that the scenario did not come from them, and said there was no evidence of forced entry at the home. Police found her in a pool of blood before dawn Thursday after neighbors in the gated community alerted them. Investigators found a 9mm pistol at the scene. Renewed calls for stricter gun laws . South Africa has a high crime rate, and many homeowners keep weapons to ward off intruders. Groups renewed calls for stricter gun laws in the nation after this week's killing. ""There are 1.5 million gun owners -- about 3.5 million guns in civilians hands,"" said Alan Storey, chairman of Gun Free South Africa. Most of the victims of gun homicides in the nation of 50 million people are between the ages 20 and 30, he said. South Africa has passed tough legislation that includes a requirement for a thorough background check for prospective gun owners. The check includes spouses and partners, and is repeated every few years, he said. ""People acquire guns believing they are more safe ... but they place themselves at greater risk,"" Storey said. ""We've made airplanes a gun-free zone. We need to bring that logic down to earth."" But the South African Gunowners' Association, a popular gun lobby group, has said citizens have the right to protect themselves from increasingly violent crimes. ""There are already more than enough laws and regulations to control the possession of firearms by private citizens,"" it says on its website. ""Fewer and less complex laws reasonably, yet properly, applied could achieve the required objective."" Postponed bail hearing . Beyond the violence, South Africans struggled with the idea that they've lost a hero, an athlete who defied incredible physical odds to become a global star. His face became a fixture on billboards across the nation, some of which started coming down after his arrest. The Pretoria court postponed Pistorius' bail hearing to Tuesday and ordered him to remain in custody until then. Prosecutors said they will argue that he committed premeditated murder. Authorities said they will oppose bail, but did not provide their reasons for the decision.

"(CNN) -- A new movie portraying their rise to the top of the tennis world will debut next month, but the Williams sisters are already giving it their best promotion after setting up their first head-to-head clash since 2009. Both won two matches at the WTA Family Circle Cup event in Charleston Friday and will meet in the semifinals, with Serena hoping to defend her title and Venus battling to regain her status after longterm health problems. Serena triumphed 6-4 6-2 against fellow American Mallory Burdette in their third-round match, with the world No. 1 setting up a rematch of last year's final against Czech Lucie Safarova -- which she then won 6-4 6-1. Her older sibling Venus was already through to the last four, having battled to defeat U.S. 12th seed Varvara Lepchenko 6-2 4-6 6-2 before cruising to a 6-4 6-4 win over 18-year-old compatriot Madison Keys. It will be only the third time they have met on clay, and the first time on the latterly green surface of this South Carolina tournament -- which dates back to the beginning of the WTA Tour in 1973 and is the oldest women's professional event. ""It was really motivating to see Venus win today -- I figured if she can win two matches, I have no excuse not to win my two matches,"" Serena said. ""Venus is the toughest opponent I've ever played. I think she's beaten me the most out of any player. I know her game and she knows my game. ""I know her patterns, she knows mine -- she probably knows mine better than I do. I think it'll be a great match tomorrow."" While Serena has bounced back from blood clots on her lungs after a freak foot injury suffered in 2010, Venus has dropped to 24th in the rankings as she struggles to overcome the autoimmune disease Sjogren's syndrome. The 32-year-old trails her sister 13-10 in career meetings, and lost their last one at the 2009 end-of-season WTA Championships. ""I've seen her so many times -- hopefully all the times I've sat in those stands watching her will give me a little help,"" said Venus, who won the 40-year-old tournament back in 2004. ""I'm looking forward to it. Last year in Charleston I fell short and I didn't hold up my end of the bargain and make the semifinals, so I'm glad I took it a step further this year."" They were joined in the last four by Jelena Jankovic, who like the Williams sisters has topped the rankings -- but without winning a grand slam. The Serbian ninth seed cruised past 19-year-old world No. 114 Eugenie Bouchard of Canada 6-2 6-1 for the 500th victory of her career. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic gave Serbia the perfect start to the Davis Cup quarterfinal against the United States as the world's No. 1 men's player defeated John Isner in Friday's opening rubber in Idaho. The big-serving American had hopes of repeating last year's win over Australian Open champion Djokovic in the ATP event at Indian Wells, but was unable to take advantage of the high-altitude conditions in Boise as he went down 7-6 (7-5) 6-2 7-5. Djokovic also prevailed when they met in the first round of the Davis Cup three years ago, as his country went on to win the title for the first time. The Serbians' hopes of going through to the last four may rest on Viktor Troicki, who was beaten in five sets by American No. 1 Sam Querrey in the second singles rubber after being asked to replace the injured world No. 10 Janko Tipsarevic. Querrey won their 2010 encounter -- a dead rubber as the Serbs had already won through -- and this time came back from 2-1 down to triumph 7-6 (7-1) 3-6 4-6 6-1 6-4 and level the score. The winner of this tie will next face either Canada or Italy, who were also 1-1 in Vancouver. Andreas Seppi gave Italy an early lead as he came from two sets down against Vasek Pospisil to win 5-7 4-6 6-4 6-3 6-3 in three hours and 15 minutes, but Canadian No. 1 Milos Raonic beat Fabio Fognini 6-4 7-6 (7-4) 7-5. Davis Cup titleholder the Czech Republic took a commanding 2-0 lead away to Kazakhstan. With top-ranked Czech Tomas Berdych absent in Astana, world No. 63 Lukas Rosol came from behind to beat Andrey Golubev 4-6 6-4 6-2 7-6 (8-6) and . No. 94 Jan Hajek crushed Mikhail Kukushkin 6-3 6-2 6-4. The Czechs can wrap up the best-of-five tie in Saturday's doubles rubber, which would set up a match with either France or Argentina. That quarterfinal was tied 1-1 after the opening day in Buenos Aires, as world No.8 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga battled to overcome 71st-ranked Carlos Berlocq 4-6 6-2 6-3 5-7 6-2 in the opening match. World No. 19 Juan Monaco, Argentina's No. 1 in the absence of Juan Martin del Potro, gave his country a lifeline by beating 13th-ranked Gilles Simon 7-6 (7-2) 6-2 6-4 on the red clay.","Williams sisters will meet in the semifinals of Family Circle Cup in Charleston .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraq's Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will not run for a third term when his current one expires in 2014, the nation's state television reported Sunday. Al-Maliki is also working to pass legislation that limits his successors to a maximum of two four-year terms in office, a senior parliamentary advisor told CNN. ""If al-Maliki passes this constitutional amendment then that means he definitely won't be a prime minister for a third term,"" said Ali Hadi al-Moussawi, an adviser to the prime minister. Iraq's constitution restricts the country's president from seeking a third term but does not set term limits for the prime minister or members of parliament. The news comes two days after al-Maliki said he would cut his salary in half amid growing unrest over poor public services and water shortages. Protesters around Iraq have said popular uprisings in both Egypt and Tunisia inspired their weeklong demonstrations for improvements in government services and their quality of life. Thousands have rallied across the country in the past week, railing against rampant poverty, a 45% national unemployment rate and shortages of food, electricity and water, including several hundred in three different parts of Baghdad on Friday. Al-Maliki said those concerns prompted his decision to axe his salary, which he said would ""help reduce the differences in the living standards for different classes."" ""Fifty percent of my monthly salary as prime minister will be reduced and returned to the government's treasury starting from the current month, as a contribution from me to reduce the difference in the salaries of the state officials,"" al-Maliki said in a statement on his official website. Meanwhile, Iraq's government submitted a revised draft budget to members of parliament Sunday, boosting projected public spending amid rising oil prices and slight decreases in the country's expected oil exports, according to government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh. The new plan would create projected deficits of up to 16 percent, he said. The budget is based on an average oil price of $76.5 per barrel and projected exports of 2.2 million barrels of oil per day, including 100,000 daily barrel exports from Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","NEW: Revised budget will boost public spending amid rising oil prices, official says .

"(CNN) -- This is it: the night that RUSH fans have waited for since 1998, when the group was first eligible to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Thursday night, the Canadian trio -- a staple of classic rock radio stations -- will jam onstage with their fellow class of inductees. We should feel vindicated, right? For the last 13 years, fans of the band have been outraged as the Hall of Fame overlooked their heroes. From the moment RUSH was eligible for consideration, fans signed petitions and wondered what kind of critics could be keeping their heroes from the limelight. Even now, fans still feel slighted. You see, these are fans who are used to explaining -- and being summarily dismissed for -- their love of the band, said ""RUSH: Beyond the lighted stage"" documentarians Sam Dunn and Scot McFadyen. RUSH has been a band almost 40 years. Their music has encompassed genres ranging from heavy metal to new age. They even penned a rap once (and caught a lot of flak for it from fans, too.) Despite selling millions of records and achieving top-of-their-field musicianship, they've never really had the respect of music critics. By extension, neither have their fans. ""I remember reading once (RUSH drummer and lyricist) Neil Peart got voted one of the worst lyricists of all time,"" Dunn said. ""And I can't imagine the rage that that would inspire in a lot of fans,"" he said. Peart's lyrics are a major reason fans cite interest in the band's music, he said. They identify and connect with Peart's words so personally, ""I absolutely think it's 'By attacking RUSH, you're attacking us,' "" Dunn said. ""And it's war."" Likewise, Geddy Lee's vocals are an unavoidable hurdle to RUSH appreciation, which fans are well aware of. His singing voice is highly pitched, in the tradition of singers like Robert Plant or Roger Daltrey, but in an extreme. ""I think one critic said it sounded like a hamster in a blender,"" McFadyen said. When they were working on the documentary and discussed with people in the industry what they were doing, people would tell him, ""Oh, I detest RUSH. They suck. I cannot stand Geddy's voice."" He's heard that before. He knows Geddy Lee's singing has a polarizing effect on people. But if you love it, you love it for life, he said, and you don't mind that it's complex, nerdy music. At their core, RUSH is a trio of outsiders. They grew up in suburban Canada, where guitarist Alex Lifeson and bassist and singer Geddy Lee were both first-generation Canadians from immigrant families, doing the best they could to avoid being the target of bullies. They didn't graduate from high school. And although they forged a career as one of the best-selling rock bands in history, the only thing rock 'n' roll about them is their music -- no drug overdoses, no sex scandals, no trashing of hotel rooms. Ever. Musicologist, author and RUSH researcher Christopher McDonald said fans deeply identify with the band because of that nonconformity. While the first wave of RUSH fans in the 1970s were seen as a homogenous audience of jean-jacket-wearing, frowning boys, it soon became obvious that the fan base was far more diverse. RUSH was dismissed by critics for their complicated songs and epically tackling fantasy and sci-fi topics in their lyrics. According to McDonald, those same qualities won them the attention of a nontraditional fan base, people who loved Dungeons & Dragons. ""RUSH didn't always go after the pop culture cliches,"" McDonald said. ""The songs were sometimes very long, the song topics were sometimes overwrought. They would have songs that quoted Hemingway, songs with a science fiction theme, an album that drew ideas from Carl Jung,"" he said. ""Who's going to be interested in something like that? It's going to be some of the people in the Chess Club."" That's why 43-year-old Web developer and proprietor of RUSH Is A Band Ed Stenger likes them. He's the first to admit you can ""count the number of RUSH love songs on one hand."" Like many fans who were exposed to the music of RUSH before 1980, (including McFadyen) he was ushered into the fandom by an older brother. ""When '2112' came out, he was 14 and the time and I was 6,"" Stenger said. ""RUSH was the background noise to my youth."" And once his older brother went to college, it was easy to dig up old RUSH LPs and cassettes. The science fiction-evoking titles caught his eye first. Then he noticed ""2112"" was a 20-minute song. ""I was like, what?!"" Stenger said, ""A song can't be 20 minutes long!"" So he listened, and the story of the lyrics and Geddy Lee's emotional delivery hooked him. He's been a RUSH fan ever since. The defining moment of his fandom was when RUSH played the entirety of ""2112"" in 1996 at Cleveland's Gund Arena. The RUSH fandom has many social divisions. As Dunn and McFadyen showed in their documentary, some people -- especially musicians -- are fans of the ideals RUSH stands for: virtuosic musicianship, fearless exploration as artists and certainly stamina and longevity.. Most easily recognized is their level of musical ability. Billy Corgan, Trent Reznor, Kirk Hammett and Les Claypool appreciate the complexity of the music and the skill it takes to execute something like the guitar solo from ""La Villa Strangiato."" ""They're like musical superheroes,"" McFadyen said. ""They do things on their instruments that mere mortals can't do."" Ask any drummer, Stenger said, and they'll tell you Neil Peart is one of the best in the world. His drum kit is a virtual fortress of percussion, dwarfing any other professional drummer's setup, McDonald said. Peart's drum solos, which can last upwards of 10 minutes, are far from a good excuse to use the restroom during a concert. ""There's people who come specifically to see his solo,"" Stenger said. ""He's able to make sounds and you can't even see him make them,"" said Dunn of Peart's legendary drumming. Fans also appreciate the artistic integrity of the band, who has historically ignored concerns and direction from their record company -- and won autonomy. Suburban youth especially appreciate the appeal of RUSH. McDonald discovered that the experience of the band spoke deeply to many others who dreamed of escaping their bedroom communities. Songs like ""Subdivisions"" from the album ""Signals"" and ""Middletown Dreams,"" from the album ""Power Windows"" became anthems for them, he said. But the albums themselves can also mark divisions in the fandom. When Geddy Lee introduced dominant synthesizers into the band's until-then heavy guitar sound, many fans stopped listening, Stenger said. ""There's a cutoff at (the album) ""Moving Pictures,"" Stenger said. RUSH's next album, ""Signals"" put the group solidly into synth-pop territory, ""and a lot of people did not like that at all."" But even so, he said, the group of RUSH fans who grew up with the band's music from the 1970s is still the largest group in the fandom. ""Then you have the fans who grew up with their music from the 1990s. Their favorite albums are 'Presto,' 'Roll the Bones,' and 'Counterparts,' "" he said. ""I tell them my favorite album is 'Caress of Steel' and they say, 'what?' "" ""Counterparts"" is another one of those divisions, McDonald said. ""That was the exact moment when Nirvana and Pearl Jam hit and the alternative '90s really started to go,"" he said. ""In some ways, the world RUSH had inhabited to great success in the '80s was ending. I think 'Roll the Bones' in '91 was their last million-seller,"" he said. Even specific songs in the RUSH repertoire divide the fandom. The aforementioned rap on the song ""Roll the Bones"" makes fans either roll their eyes or chuckle at the band's sense of humor. The song ""The Trees"" off the album ""Hemispheres"" either induces an ""icky feeling,"" as Dunn puts it, or evokes a passionate speech about the epic qualities of the guitar-driven composition and political analysis of Peart's fable-like lyrics. RUSH probably won't play ""Roll the Bones"" or ""The Trees"" during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, but it's a safe bet there won't be a single unlit Zippo in the group's fanbase when Peart breaks into his solo.","RUSH fans are used to being dismissed for their love of the band .

"(CNN) -- Newly released photographs show what a damaged World Trade Center tower and its collapse looked like from a New York Police Department helicopter as it flew nearby on September 11, 2001, in New York. The aerial photos were obtained by ABC News after it filed a Freedom of Information Act request last year with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which had collected the images for its investigation into the towers' collapse. A couple of the images show one of the twin towers burning after a hijacked airplane had flown into it. Others show it collapsing, and the rest show the clouds of debris and dust spreading below after the towers crumbled. Each of the 12 images offers a rare look at what the devastation looked like from above. Hijackers flew two commercial jetliners into the twin towers that day, killing 2,752 people. On the same day, hijackers flew another airplane into the Pentagon in Washington, killing 184 people. A fourth hijacked plane, headed to an unknown target, crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing 40.","Aerial images show World Trade Center tower burning, then collapsing .

"(CNN) -- It was a remark that launched a media firestorm. Should it have? In the midst of praising California Attorney General Kamala Harris on Thursday, President Barack Obama described her as ""by far the best-looking"" AG of all. By Friday, the uproar over the remark was such that the president called Harris to apologize for the ""distraction created by the comments,"" according to his spokesman, Jay Carney. CNN.com readers were sharply divided over whether such an apology was warranted. Some drew on their own personal experiences with such incidents. Commenter Lulany said that she is often ""annoyed"" at the focus on women's appearance that she observes day to day, but that the president did not commit a foul here. ""It's a comment you often hear from men to point out that a woman is more pleasant to the eye. I don't see much harm in that especially coming from a man who is surrounded by strong women and clearly has the highest respect for them."" James Pfeiffer mentioned how, one day, he was complimented on his ""beautiful hair"" by a woman in the parking lot of a golf course. ""I was speechless. But you know, it really made a 65-year-old guy feel pretty good."" He said the ""politicization"" of such remarks would mean ""soon we'll all be just staring dumbly at one another from the fear of saying something wrong."" But what about incidents at the workplace? ""Consider this: You are at work and you tell your co-worker, 'By the way, you are the best looking co-worker here,'"" said commenter ""Me Not You."" ""Could you be in the HR office by the end of the day? I think so."" Commenter ""Person of Interest"" recalled telling a female co-worker that her new haircut brought out her eyes. ""Next thing I know, I hear about how I was being inappropriate and hitting on her,"" he explained. ""When I asked her about it, she said she didn't think I was and in fact she was happy all day long that at least one man noticed it. A few weeks later, she complimented my girlfriend about how sweet I am to notice things like that. My girlfriend agreed."" Another commenter, ""pmn,"" said that she went through a very similar experience to that of Harris, being introduced as a new employee. ""One of the male executives announced that she is definitely good-looking compared to a past employee,"" she said. ""So inappropriate. I turned completely red and felt very awkward."" And ""jon"" commented that remarks like that are banned from his workplace. Paul Hogue, who stated that he supported the president, found the comment out of line, imagining if the scenario were slightly different. ""I don't recall a president commenting on how rugged their vice president looks, specifically because it detracts from the reason they are hired."" ""Really?"" also commented by imagining that the tables had been turned somewhat. ""What would the response have been if a female politician with tremendous power had remarked that a male politician with less power was the 'best-looking so and so'?"" They added that ultimately, it comes down to the context and setting. ""If a comment like this is made between close friends, no big deal -- although the time and place the comment is made could be questioned since others may not know that it is a comment between friends. If a comment like this is made between people that are only meeting recently, or for the first time, in this type of forum -- not appropriate at all, regardless of political affiliation and/or position of power.""","Commenters weighed in on Obama's remark about California AG's looks .

"(CNN) -- Capt. James T. Kirk always cut a formidable figure as commander of the starship USS Enterprise. It helped, too, to have some powerful toys -- like a one-of-a-kind Phaser rifle. Somebody inherited some of Kirk's mojo, after paying $231,000 for the rifle that actor William Shatner once toted around while filming the ""Star Trek"" series in the 1960s, Julien's Auctions said Saturday. The winning bid came in well over the auction house's $50,000 to $70,000 estimate. According to Julien's, inventor Reuben Klamer created the weapon after NBC asked that the ""Star Trek"" pilot be ""retooled for a more action-packed adventure."" ""Star Trek"" creator Gene Roddenberry ""asked for a really big gun,"" the auction house said. Shatner only used the Phaser rifle in the second pilot. Klamer then got it back (though it was used in some publicity photos) while Shatner, as Kirk, got a more familiar pistol used for the rest of the next three seasons. The ""Star Trek"" showpiece was one of many pieces of Hollywood history that were part of the Julien's auction. Other big-ticket items that were sold include a Munchkins flower plot from ""The Wizard of Oz"" that went for $15,000, a flying suit worn by Christopher Reeve in ""Superman IV"" that fetched $25,000, and a nightshirt that belonged to Marilyn Monroe that sold for $15,000.

"(CNN) -- Jobs, say hundreds of thousands of people. Pollution, say hundreds of thousands of others. They say that's what a proposed oil pipeline would bring into the country, as it transports crude from massive deposits in Canadian tar sands to refineries and ports in the United States. The Keystone XL pipeline has triggered a gush of comments from Americans for and against its construction. The State Department in Washington has received 1.2 million since early March, when it came out in support of the project. It began publishing them on its website Thursday. The first 100,000 appeared this week, and the department plans to publish a similar number of comments every week, according to a statement. The comments are directed at a document the State Department published in March to justify its approval of the Keystone XL in light of what it considered environmentally sound planning. The Environmental Protection Agency strongly disagreed and batted down State Department's draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, giving it the equivalent of a ""C-"" grade as an environmental document. Environmentally concerned citizens have piled in on top of the guardians of America's ecology and appear to have turned in most of the comments arriving at the State Department. Citizens highlighting the possible economic benefits have joined the fight, siding with the pipeline's proponents. Obama's rock and hard place . The politics of oil, jobs and ecology have put President Obama between a rock and hard place, as the ultimate decision to permit the Keystone XL's construction rests on his shoulders alone. Proponents of the Keystone XL pipeline, many of them Republican lawmakers the president is seeking compromises from, say it will give America energy independence, thousands of jobs and important industrial infrastructure, and won't cost taxpayers a dime. Among its detractors are some of Obama's traditional allies, who were instrumental in getting him elected. They say the massive pipe is dangerous, inherently filthy and must be stopped. State Department vs. EPA . In its lengthy study, the State Department, headed by John Kerry, weighed in on the side of the proponents. But after reviewing it, the EPA sent a letter to high officials at the State Department, blasting the environmental impact statement. The environmental agency rated it as EO-2, a bureaucratic moniker for ""Environmental Objections-Insufficient Information,"" a below-average grade on the EPA's scale. The Canadian crude in its raw form is mixed with sand. Extracting the oil and transporting it requires more energy than pumping crude out of a well. Thrusting it through long pipes increases the energy consumption. That higher energy use leads to greater greenhouse gas emissions, an increase of ""18.7 million metric tons (20 million tons) C02 ... per year when compared to an equal amount of U.S. average crudes,"" the EPA said. The State Department's assessment concludes that just as much Canadian oil will make it to market, by train if necessary, if no pipeline is built, therefore there would be little additional ecological impact. The EPA argued that ""while informative,"" that train of thought is out of date. In comes public opinion . Many of the U.S. citizens' comments arriving at the State Department are duplicated form letters sent or signed by multiple commenters. They are associated with organizations that usually propagate one of two polarized arguments. In its form letters, members of the group Action Tar bemoan ""the killing a vast forests, to the contamination of terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric ecosystems which we all depend on."" But like most of the ecological protesters, it drives home the aspect of climate change, caused by ""a new super greenhouse gasoline."" Additional boosts to climate change also make up the core of the EPA's objections. Form letters from proponent groups counter with arguments of economic urgency. ""... approve this project. Keystone XL will ensure American energy security and create jobs and economic opportunity in Nebraska."" Obama's own former deputy press secretary is leading the charge to push the president to stop the pipeline. Bill Burton quit his job before the 2012 election to head up the super PAC Priorities USA, which worked for the president's re-election. In January, he joined the PR firm Global Strategy Group as an executive vice president. He is now representing a new coalition, ""All Risk, No Reward,"" which opposes Keystone XL. It goes after the additional greenhouse gases but also showcases the damage to Americans in the heartland caused by spills. Obama must decide . Obama has promised to decide soon on whether or not to allow the TransCanada oil company to lay the 835-mile long Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Nebraska. The Keystone XL would pump 830,000 barrels of oil sands crude per day through America's heartland, connecting crude producers in Canada with refineries and shipping companies in the United States. TransCanada would cover all the costs, proponents argue, making it practically a gift to the U.S. oil infrastructure. On its way to Nebraska, where it would connect with other, already existing pipelines, Keystone XL would pick up additional oil produced in Montana and North Dakota and stream it south, TransCanada said on its website. It would reduce ""American dependence on oil from Venezuela and the Middle East by up to 40 percent,"" TransCanada extols. But the EPA is also concerned about oil spills, particularly since sands crude is different from conventional crude. It cites a 2010 pipe break in Michigan, which spurted out 20,000 barrels of sands crude. Some of it sank to the bottom of the Kalamazoo River and could not be completely cleaned up in three years' time, the EPA said. ""Spills of diluted bitumen may require different response actions or equipment,"" the letter stated. ""These spills can also have different impacts than spills of conventional oil."" Nebraska's response . The State Department's assessment represents its second go-round with the Canadian company. It originally rejected a permit from TransCanada, last year, over the proposed route through Nebraska. TransCanada came up with a new route that the State Department approved of, but the EPA says it misses the mark. Nebraska's Republican Gov. Dave Heineman has approved the project, and U.S. Rep. Lee Terry, R-Nebraska, has called for the Keystone XL's construction in a Republican radio address. The pipeline ""is primed to give our economy a shot in the arm and make energy more affordable -- and it won't cost the taxpayers a dime,"" he argued. Terry spoke a day after an apparent pipeline rupture in the Arkansas town of Mayflower in late March, about 20 miles north of Little Rock. Black torrents of diluted bitumen flowed through the community, forcing the evacuation of 22 homes.","The president has faced high political pressure on the Keystone XL pipeline .

"(CNN) -- A 10-year-old boy, his face still innocent, abducted from his village and forced to kill alongside ruthless militia fighters. A 60-year-old grandmother too ashamed of the injuries caused by a brutal rape to leave her house for five months, even though her wounds worsened. A girl who reminded me of my own daughter, bridging the years between youth and womanhood, who had been dragged into a forest near her house by a group of men and raped, over and over again. Images of these people, whose quiet but warm personalities barely hint at the atrocities they have survived, give a human face to the conflict in eastern Congo that has long moved me as an activist. With well over 5 million people dead through war and its accompanying hardships spanning more than a decade, it is difficult to imagine the daily impact of a conflict of this magnitude, much less to feel empowered to do anything about it. A new documentary film, ""Blood in the Mobile,"" powerfully addresses both the limits of the imagination and our sense of connection to atrocities committed on the other side of the world. Through a shaky camera in the damp and dark mines of eastern Congo, filmmaker Frank Poulsen introduces us to some of the young men (and even children) toiling at the first stage of Congo's lucrative business in tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. But the wealth of this industry doesn't really benefit the Congolese miners for their back-breaking, perilous and poorly paid work -- not by a long shot. Militia groups and factions of the Congo's army control many mines, imposing heavy ""taxes"" on miners for whom there are few alternatives for making a living. Juxtapose these gritty images of Congo with shots filmed at the headquarters of Nokia, the electronics powerhouse that sells these minerals in its consumer products, and you have a message that is difficult to ignore: the cell phones, laptops, digital cameras and other products we have come to rely on link all of us to the conflict in Congo. As consumers, we're perpetuating the conflict. We have an obligation but also an opportunity. I was fortunate to have a chance to travel to eastern Congo recently to see with my own eyes and to feel, even with the relative safety of traveling with the ever-attentive Fidel Bafilemba of the Enough Project, the psychological effect of spending time in an unpredictable conflict zone. I was struck by how we witnessed the raw, nervous strain of communities said to be post-conflict, post-traumatic. But nothing seemed to be ""post-"": Indeed, these communities appear to be enduring conflict and trauma on a daily basis. Local organizations, from the reintegration center for child soldiers to the rehabilitation center for survivors of sexual violence, are working as hard as they can to provide solace and a hopeful future for those most physically and emotionally harmed by the conflict. But as necessary as these efforts are, they treat the symptoms; there is little concept of pre-emptive or preventive. Two years had passed since U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton came to one of the same towns I visited. Nearly everyone I met remembered ""Mama Clinton"" and asked me to follow up with her when I returned to the United States. ""I think it is no secret to you,"" one woman said, speaking into the videocamera and addressing Clinton. ""Our wealth is being plundered, and that's why we are being raped."" She urged Clinton to make good on her promise to bring high-level U.S. attention to the crisis in Congo. In particular, Clinton's leadership and gravitas are needed to implement an international certification scheme that enables companies to trace the source of the minerals to ensure that they aren't funding armed groups, and that allows consumers to choose which companies to give business to, based on their human rights record in Congo. Visiting Congo for the first time without knowing the local language, Kiswahili, I was dependent on my talented interpreter Fidel for putting into words my countless questions and gratitude to the people I interviewed. But in those moments when I sat face-to-face with women, neither of us speaking while we listened to his translation, I would often catch a look, a slight nod, that clearly said, ""I know you know. I know you understand."" Women have a natural, inherent knowingness, an unspoken connection between us, as mothers, wives and sisters. For several years I have followed Congo from afar, understanding theoretically and intellectually how we in the United States could help end the conflict. Now I deeply feel the why. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robin Wright.","In Congo, militia groups and army factions control many mines, says Robin Wright .

"(CNN) -- For more than a year I've tried to get Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus to make an appearance on my Sunday morning news show on TV One, the nation's second-largest black cable network. He has also been invited to appear on my daily segment on ""The Tom Joyner Morning Show,"" with 8 million listeners. Although Priebus did tell me ""yes"" a year ago, on the day of the GOP primary debate in South Carolina, he has yet to show up and talk GOP politics to either of these audiences. This is no shock to me, because most white Republicans I've invited appear to be deathly afraid to accept invites to appear on both shows. In fact, it has been tough even getting a callback or an e-mail from GOP staffers. Since the debut of my show, ""Washington Watch,"" in September 2009, we have had an open invitation for any member of the GOP House or Senate Conference to appear on the show. In four years, only four -- Reps. Tom Price (twice), Allen West, Steve King, and Pete Olson -- have appeared on the show. None was verbally attacked. None was called a bigot or a racist. None was prevented from talking. We had polite, but firm, discourse on multiple issues. Any of them would tell you I was more than fair, providing them with a forum to discuss their policy differences with President Barack Obama and Democrats. Think about that: Even GOP backbenchers who rarely get called to appear on a national TV or radio show seem afraid to show up. You would think they'd welcome a chance to share their policies with a constituency that routinely doesn't vote for them. But Republicans routinely pass it up, and then wonder why they don't get the votes of blacks and other minorities. What I'm describing points up a much larger problem with the GOP and its inability to speak to issues that all voters care about. That's why I find it interesting that at the GOP retreat this past weekend in Virginia, there was a session entitled, ""Coalitions-Discussion on Successful Comms w/ Minorities & Women."" Comms stands for ""communications."" If Republicans want to understand how to successfully communicate with minorities and women, it sure would help to actually go to the forums where minorities and women read, listen and watch. When Michael Steele was chairman of the RNC, he appeared on my TV show and radio segments on many occasions. I could call him on his cell phone or at home and book him on a moment's notice. See, Steele understood that if you want to communicate a policy to black people, it helps to talk to them. Maybe his being black is the reason. The mental block that keeps the GOP from engaging black folks and others could have something to do with its perception of the issues we care about. For instance, a prominent black Republican in Illinois told me about a presentation a few years ago with party elders about how they could attract black voters. When it was all done, this Republican said, the first comment from the floor was, ""We are not going to support welfare."" The group of black Republicans was puzzled: ""We didn't even bring up welfare. What are you talking about?"" The GOP apparently has the idea that minorities don't care about education, taxes, entrepreneurship, homeownership, and a litany of other issues. When Republicans speak to black folks and the main thing they have to say is that the GOP is the party of Lincoln and he freed the slaves, then you have a problem. Yes, Republicans played a critical role in civil rights legislation during the 1950s and 1960s while Southern Democrats were obstructionists -- but it's the GOP's concern for blacks and minorities in the last four decades that has been troubling and problematic. Republican consultants will say that cultivating minority voters is a waste of time. That's a short-term view. I would think that allowing the opposition party to get 90% of a group's vote without lifting a finger -- because your own ineptitude prevents you from making your case -- means trouble long-term. Republicans could compete for minority votes if they were actually interested in listening to the concerns of said voters. But if they just want to talk to minority voters and not listen, they cannot compete. I know a bunch of African-Americans who don't self-identify as Democrats. They, and I am one of them, have voted for both Republicans and Democrats. The issues that we care about vary. It's not about ideology or party; it's about what you can do to be of help to those in need. If the GOP wants to learn how to communicate with minorities, it must listen to and work with the numerous minority Republicans who have been shouting this from the rooftop for years. You want to hear evidence from a couple of white guys? Pick up the phone and call former U.S. Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio. He enjoyed sizable black support because when he was mayor of Cleveland, he didn't avoid minorities and treat them as outcasts. He sat down with them, shared their concerns, and worked on public policy -- together. Give Mike Huckabee a ring. When he was governor of Arkansas, he earned a lot of black votes for the same reason as Voinovich. He has urged the GOP to reach out. One issue where Republicans are finding themselves working with black civil rights leaders and pastors is in the area of sentencing reform. African-Americans see a legal system that has turned into a moneymaking machine for private prisons. GOP governors see state budgets out of control. A major civil rights leader told me he has found more success working with GOP governors than Democratic governors on sentencing reform. This is an example of what happens when individuals sit down, talk, share their concerns, and find common ground. But as long as the GOP is scared to even sit down with black folks and other minorities, it can expect to keep getting dusted at the ballot box. And don't look to blame anyone else but yourselves, when you were given the chance and your own ignorance prevented you from reaching across the divide to talk. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: GOP National Committee's Priebus dodges appearing on Martin shows .

"(CNN) -- A chance Facebook encounter has given two Michigan brothers a chance to walk free after nearly 25 years behind bars for a murder they say they never committed. Raymond and Thomas Highers, both 46, were sentenced to life in prison for the 1987 murder of a suspected Detroit drug dealer. They are now getting a new trial -- set to start in mid August, according to court authorities -- after developments stemming from conversations on a Facebook page for people who had lived in a Detroit neighborhood in past decades. One of those former neighborhood residents, Mary Evans, mentioned the Highers and ""how horrible it is"" that they remained in jail for a crime that she said many believed they did not commit. That prompted a man named Kevin Zieleniewski to converse about his former roommate who apparently witnessed two men with guns enter victim Robert Karey's home just prior to a shooting that left Karey dead. The ex-roommate, John Hielscher, said a total of four men entered the house that night on June 26, 1987, according to a 2011 affidavit. Hielscher described all four men as African-American, according to the affidavit. Raymond and Thomas Highers are white. Hielscher's testimony prompted Wayne County Court Judge Lawrence Talon to throw out the decades-old murder convictions last week. ""The court found that the new evidence we found was reliable and credible,"" said Highers' attorney Janet Napp. ""These men have proclaimed their innocence all these years and nothing has changed. Finally because of Facebook, witnesses have been discovered."" In the affidavit, Hielscher said he hadn't come forward out of fear the real killers would come after him. The Wayne County prosecutors office declined to comment, though it can appeal the court's decision to overturn the past conviction, according to office spokeswoman Maria Miller. Court authorities confirmed the new trial, but declined additional comment. ""I always believed that they were innocent,"" said the Highers brothers' aunt, Janet Hirth. ""(The brothers) are relieved. Their spirits are great. They're not bitter, they just want to move forward."" A bond hearing is scheduled for August 13. Under Michigan state law, a judge must review inmates' conduct in prison before releasing them even if their convictions are set aside.","Two Michigan brothers are granted a new trial after 25 years .

"(CNN) -- I have been a professional educator for 40 years. I have worked at every level of the public school spectrumâ€”elementary through high school. Having been in education for such a long time, I have witnessed many changes, all aimed at school improvement. Needless to say, not all the suggestions have been sensible. What may appear to be a good idea on paper, or when sitting around a table in discussion of it, does not always make for good reality, especially at the schoolhouse. It is important to note that most of the dictates for schools are proposed by people who have never taught. Regardless of the studies and research aimed at school improvement, I believe good educators have always known what makes schools work more efficiently. However, we get bogged down in rhetoric and what is ""hot"" at the moment. I believe that sustained school improvement will take guts (good old fashioned courage), focus and stamina. Here are a few tenets that make sense to me: . If a child is not present at school, he or she cannot possibly learn. Schools that consistently report high student achievement consistently have students with great attendance. Yet one of our greatest school problems is student attendance. Why do we have to beg parents to get their children to school, to convince them that we need their children present and as stress free as possible? A parent asked me once why her child needed to come to school every day. She was actually upset that the school district had a policy that addressed absent and tardy children. She said it was not the school's business to tell her how to raise her children. Of course, that did not make sense. Students are often caught in the middle of home/school discord. We should be on the same page! In an ideal world, all parents would recognize the need for excellence and consistency. Until the world reaches that ideal state, we must continue to strive for improved communication between home and school. TED.com: How schools kill creativity . All children must have a champion, one who makes solid and sensible decisions that will help them grow into mature, happy and reliable adults. It does not have to be a parent, but it has to be someone. And while it makes sense to hold home to a standard, where are our standards for educators? Why do we allow incompetence to remain? Doing so does not make sense. Many poor teachers stay on the job for decades and it is often the poorest schools that are saddled with the poorest teachers. I am not aware of any corporate entity (other than schools) that passes incompetence around in a circle. If it is proven that a teacher can't teach (as indicated by low student performance, low enthusiasm, non-existent relationships with students and co-workers) why aren't they fired? Sports franchises look for the best players and coaches to create a winning team. They hire scouts to find the best personnel and pay them accordingly. I believe that if we paid for excellence and then insisted on it, the academic complexion of our schools would change dramatically. At the public schoolhouse, the players are on the team by default. Public school educators do not get to choose who makes the team and who doesn't. Everyone who walks on the field must be coached They may not all be first string, all of them may not make the college or pro team, but they must all know how the game is played and the rules for doing so. It is impossible to create an excellent team with inferior coaching, with players who are allowed to make up their own rules. Championship schools and classrooms are deliberate, not accidental. TED.com: Your elusive creative genius . It makes sense to pay attention -- our students give us clues about their lives every day. Signs that a student will potentially drop out are evident long before high school, but that is often when we begin to take notice. Negative and belligerent attitudes, poor academic performance, low attendance rates and a failure to develop positive relationships are evident early on in many children. However, our school counselors and social workers have been cut from the school budget, or have been assigned other duties. A large percentage of children who drop out of high school read far below grade level. The problem presents itself at the elementary level, yet children are continuously passed on. Wouldn't it make more sense to intensely focus on teaching students to read? Instead, we opt for placing them in special education. Not wanting to be considered ""mentally retarded,"" children are embarrassed and angry and therefore drop out socially long before their physical departure. TED.com: Where does creativity hide? It makes sense to create a winning spirit in children. All may not want to attend college, but that is what we push for all. Why do we make the students who want to learn a skill or trade feel inferior to their college bound counterparts? That doesn't seem fair, nor does it make sense. We have basically told children that they will be useless citizens without a college degree. The last time I needed a plumber, I didn't ask for his college diploma, I checked for this level of expertise and proof of customer satisfaction. Teachers should encourage skill excellence and passion for whatever students choose to do or become. It just makes sense.

It takes guts to hold students and teachers accountable, she says .

"(CNN) -- The scene is set: the world's best tennis player against ""the King of Clay."" ""I'm not going out there to play my best; I'm going out there to win,"" Novak Djokovic said after setting up a Sunday final showdown with eight-time defending champion Rafael Nadal at the Monte Carlo Masters. ""Whenever you play Rafa, you know what to expect -- you expect the toughest challenge possible on clay. I'm ready for that. I'm very happy that physically, mentally, emotionally I have been improving as the tournament was going on. Each day I feel better on the court, more confident."" The world No. 1 brushed aside Italy's Fabio Fognini on Saturday, winning 6-2 6-1 in less than an hour to give himself a chance of avenging his defeat to the Spaniard in last year's title match in the principality, and also that of 2009. ""Of course, I will have to be on top of my game,"" the Serbian said. ""I will have to be focused and motivated from the start to the end in order to have any chance of winning against Nadal. I need to have a very optimistic mindset in order to get a win."" While Djokovic is returning to fitness after injuring his ankle on Davis Cup duty earlier this month, Nadal's longterm knee problems seem to be behind him after earning his fifth consecutive final appearance since his February comeback. The 11-time grand slam champion was tested for the second match in a row before defeating France's world No. 8 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-3 7-6 (7-3) in Saturday's opening semifinal in one hour and 36 minutes. ""Playing five tournaments in a row after injury, being in five finals in a row is great,"" said Nadal, who has won three of four of those so far. ""It will be very tough. Djokovic brings you to the limit of your game if you want to have chances to win. I know I have to play better than what I did today and yesterday to try to win tomorrow. I have to play more aggressive."" They have not met since Nadal won last year's French Open final -- his record seventh title on the red clay of Roland Garros -- and the Spaniard holds a 19-14 career advantage in their matches. ""These kind of matches are special all the time. I am very happy to have the chance to play these kind of matches another time,"" said Nadal, whose only defeat in 49 appearances in Monte Carlo was back in 2003. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic's grip on the women's Fed Cup title slipped on Saturday after Italy took a 2-0 lead in Palermo. The Czechs triumphed in 2011-12 after Italy won it two successive times, but face an uphill battle in Sunday's reverse singles after world No. 7 Sara Errani beat Lucie Safarova 6-4 6-2 and Roberta Vinci upset eighth-ranked Petra Kvitova 6-4 6-1. Kvitova, who also lost to Vinci last weekend in the final of the Katowice event in Poland, must now beat last year's French Open runner-up Errani to prevent Italy taking an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the best-of-five rubber. ""I hope I can cancel this match in my mind and have a free mind for tomorrow,"" Kvitova said. ""I'm still getting better, and it's obviously tough to be 100% ready to play these girls on clay but we'll see."" Slovakia also need just one more point to reach the November 2-3 final after taking a shock 2-0 over Russia in Moscow. Dominika Cibulkova beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 5-7 6-1 6-4, and then Daniela Hantuchova defeated Maria Kirilenko 6-2 6-4 as the Slovakians seek to reach their first final since winning the 2002 title.","Rafael Nadal will play Novak Djokovic in Sunday's final of the Monte Carlo Masters .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration proposed two new rules Friday that it estimates could eliminate up to 1.25 million foodborne illnesses each year from such pathogens as Salmonella, Listeria and E. Coli. The new regulations are part of the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act, which aims to make the agency more proactive at preventing outbreaks. Each year one out of every six Americans gets sick from foodborne illnesses, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Roughly 128,000 people are hospitalized and 3,000 die. ""We really need to do more than react after the fact,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg said in a news briefing. ""Preventing problems before they cause harm is not only common sense, it is key to food safety in the 21st century."" One rule requires ""science-based standards for growing, harvesting, packing and holding produce on domestic and foreign farms."" It addresses a variety of possible routes of food contamination including the manure used as fertilizer, water sprayed on crops, animals in the fields, whether workers wash their hands and how packing houses process foods. The other rule sets out guidelines for ""preventive controls for human food"" and would require companies to have plans for foodborne illnesses. ""It's basic common sense,"" said Michael Taylor, FDA deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine. ""In each individual facility the operator simply must identify the potential hazards, identify the controls that can work ... to reduce those hazards, implement those controls on a continuing basis, document, keep records and then make corrections when needed."" The two proposed rules will be available for public comment for 120 days. If they go into effect as written, companies would have up to four years, depending on their size, to comply. Food safety advocates applauded the new rules. ""This is a really important step toward food safety standards that would prevent contamination whether it is produced in a food factory or being produced on a farm,"" said Chris Waldrop, director of the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America. ""Unfortunately, It took a series of large foodborne illness outbreaks to make people wake up and say this is a problem that needs to be addressed."" Salmonella in peanut butter sickened 42 people last fall and cantaloupes tainted with Listeria infected 146 people and killed 30 in 2011, according to the CDC. ""You can just look at a couple of recent outbreaks that were quite serious in terms of burden of illnesses and they occurred because of problems that would have been addressed by these kinds of approaches,"" Hamburg said, without referencing specific incidents. Still, concerns remain over whether the agency will be able to make the new rules work as intended. ""One of the key questions here is resources for FDA and making sure that FDA has enough money, enough resources to enforce this,"" Waldrop said. When asked about the cost of the program, Hamburg was not able to provide a price tag. ""It's difficult to answer both in terms of overall cost and initial cost to implement,"" she said. ""There will also be savings overall to the system and new efficiencies, and of course prevention of problems that would have taken a toll both in health and on industry and health care."" The agency expects private companies will enforce the new guidelines on their suppliers and counts on partnerships with local governments to help police them. ""FDA may do some inspections, but we have limited resources to inspect produce operations and we have a clear direction from Congress to collaborate with state agencies so we expect much of the oversight to come at the state and local level,"" Taylor said. The FDA says additional rules are expected, including those addressing foreign suppliers, animal food and third -party auditors. CNN's Athena Jones contributed to this report.","Rules address produce safety and preventive controls for human food .

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- As Michelle Obama took the stage at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday night, she faced a similar task as Ann Romney of presenting her husband as a father and family man, above his public persona in the political spotlight. ""When people ask me whether being in the White House has changed my husband, I can honestly say that when it comes to his character, and his convictions, and his heart, Barack Obama is still the same man I fell in love with all those years ago,"" Mrs. Obama said. The first lady spoke on the convention's opening night, exactly one week after Ann Romney delivered what one CNN analyst called ""political velvet,"" an address at the GOP convention in Tampa that took her sometimes robotic businessman husband, Mitt Romney, and turned him into a charismatic candidate who will be a champion of working-class Americans. Michelle Obama has an easier job ahead of her in convincing voters of the president's likability; his favorability in this area ranks far above that of his GOP opponent. But she still worked to counter a perception that Obama is a cool and sometimes distant president who has been slow to build relationships outside the White House. Photo: Obama watches first lady's speech on TV with daughters . She also weighed in on what drives Obama's decision-making process, noting letters that he reads at night with ""concern in his eyes"" from struggling Americans. ""As president, you can get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people. But at the end of the day, when it comes time to make that decision, as president, all you have to guide you are your values, and your vision, and the life experiences that make you who you are,"" she said. Both Obamas have talked openly about the importance of the family dinner and spending time with their two daughters, 11-year-old Sasha and 14-year-old Malia, outside of the demands of the White House. Campaign officials said Michelle Obama's focus would be to help augment the campaign's strategy to use the convention as a way to show ""what drives (the president) every day."" Opinion: Michelle Obama has redefined black women . A senior campaign official was more specific in the hours leading up to the speech. Describing the first lady as ""the most popular political figure in America,"" the official said the aim was for her to highlight the president's personal experience and serve as a ""character witness"" for her husband. She stuck to the planned themes. ""I have seen firsthand that being president doesn't change who you are -- it reveals who you are,"" Mrs. Obama said. She further touched on her own story, growing up on the south side of Chicago, and shared stories about the values handed down by her parents. ""We learned about gratitude and humility, that so many people had a hand in our success, from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean, and we were taught to value everyone's contribution and treat everyone with respect,"" Mrs. Obama said. Michelle Obama convention speech dress dazzles, scores . One thing Michelle Obama didn't do was go on the attack. ""The first lady has not attacked political opponents in any way over the past four years,"" the official said while speaking to CNN reporters covering the convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. Lisa Burns, a professor of communications at Quinnipiac University with a focus on media and first ladies, said she's not surprised by the positive tone of the speech. ""With the wives, they aren't there to provide the real red meat for the political junkies. There's enough of that from other speakers,"" Burns said. ""Their job is to reach out to the undecided voters and people who are tuning into the campaign for the first time -- so they want to keep it positive."" Burns said it will take more than the first lady's speech to drum up the support necessary for her husband to win reelection. ""She can definitely make a difference tonight, but ultimately when people go to the voting booths, they're not voting for the wife,"" Burns said. However, she faced a friendly audience on Tuesday. What we learned from Day One of the convention . The first lady is known as a warm, open woman whose latest favorable numbers in a CNN/ORC International poll hit 65%. Obama campaign officials describe her as the ""most popular political figure in America."" Just four years ago, she was being portrayed as an Afro-sporting, machine gun-toting, Angela Davis figure fist-bumping her husband in a cartoon on the cover of the New Yorker. She's built her likeable reputation by tackling such issues as childhood obesity with her ""Let's Move!"" campaign, holding several high-profile events at the White House and appearing in public service announcements to encourage children and their parents to maintain an active lifestyle. She also started a vegetable garden on the grounds of the executive mansion. Even her eye for fashion has gained admiration. Mrs. Obama regularly opts to wear cardigans and skirts from such retail chains as J. Crew over high-end designers, putting her on similar shopping grounds as female middle-class voters. Lines from speeches that killed . She wore a dress by New York designer Tracey Reese for her convention appearance. The women's vote is especially key in this election, as Democrats work to paint Romney and the Republican Party as out of touch with female voters. In a recent interview with Parade magazine, the first lady indicated she'd like to add women's health issues to her list of causes if her husband is elected to a second term. Michelle Obama has stepped up in recent days to help fill the void left by her husband's busy campaign schedule, meeting with family members of the victims in the Sikh temple shooting in Wisconsin, stumping for her husband on the campaign trail and calling for volunteers to rally voters in battleground states. She continued that prominent surrogate role in a bid to set the tone for her husband's final push toward Election Day. The president watched his wife's speech from the White House with the couple's daughters who had their first day of school on Tuesday -- a particularly significant day for eldest daughter Malia, who started high school.

"(CNN) -- On the anniversary of the death of Joe Paterno, a few dozen people visited a mural depicting the image of the college football coaching legend whose legacy was tarnished by the Jerry Sandusky child molestation scandal. With the temperature in single digits, about 40 fans in State College, Pennsylvania, stopped by the mural that depicts Paterno and other prominent figures in Penn State University history, according to video shot by CNN affiliate WHP. Paterno died January 22, 2012, at age 85 in a State College hospital, according to his family. He had been suffering from lung cancer and a broken pelvis. He had been the all-time leader in major college football victories for a coach, with 409 wins. But a decision by the governing body of major college sports struck 111 victories from his record, beginning in 1998 -- a move that posthumously bumped him from the top of the list. Last July, the NCAA levied unprecedented sanctions against the university, including a fine of $60 million and stripped 14 seasons of wins by Paterno's teams. Paterno, who coached at Penn State for 46 years, was fired after authorities arrested Sandusky, a Penn State defensive coordinator who retired in 1999 and founded a charity for young people. In 2002, a graduate assistant brought to Paterno allegations of Sandusky's sexual abuse in one of Penn State's facilities. Paterno informed his supervisors of the report, but the school's board of trustees fired Paterno in November 2011, saying he could no longer perform his duties in the shadow of scandal. In an interview with the Washington Post published a week before he died, Paterno said that he felt inadequate to deal with the allegations. ""I didn't know exactly how to handle it and I was afraid to do something that might jeopardize what the university procedure was,"" the Post quoted him as saying. ""So I backed away and turned it over to some other people, people I thought would have a little more expertise than I did. It didn't work out that way."" Sandusky was convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts of child sex abuse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. The mural has been altered in light of the scandal. The artist painted over an image of Sandusky and also removed a halo above Paterno's head.","Dozens of fans stop by mural depicting famous Penn State figures .

"(CNN) -- Coming out of the closets of our culture seems to be the thing to do these days, but it is not a new phenomenon. In the inaugural issue of Ms. magazine in 1972, dozens of American women signed a statement declaring ""We Have Had Abortions,"" even though abortion was still mostly illegal in the United States. Celebrity names dotted the listâ€”Gloria Steinem, Nora Ephron, Lillian Hellman and Billie Jean King among them. This consciousness-raising maneuver played a key role in changing public attitudes toward abortion. It contributed to what legal scholars Linda Greenhouse and Reva Siegel call the ""successive waves of arguments"" that ""prompted growing public support for liberalizing access to abortion."" A year later, the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision decriminalized most abortions. In 1978, former first lady Betty Ford entered the Long Beach Naval Hospital's Drug and Rehabilitation Service, and publicly admitted her own alcohol and drug dependency. In 1982, she became founding director of the Betty Ford Center for the treatment of drug and alcohol abuse. While many remained silent, celebrities Liza Minnelli, Elizabeth Taylor and Ali MacGraw all chose to openly share their experience at the center. At a 1991 press conference, NBA megastar Magic Johnson announced that he had tested positive for HIV. He retired from basketball and subsequently served as a public voice for HIV-AIDS education, prevention and anti-discrimination efforts. Opinion: Jolie's choice carries risks along with benefits . Last month, NBA player Jason Collins announced that he is gay. While he justly deserves praise for an action that puts him among the first active American athletes in any of the four major professional team sports to publicly so identify, it has also been widely noted that he is far from early or alone in the coming out ranks of major athletes. Celebrity names already dot that list too -- Greg Louganis, Martina Navratilova, Sheryl Swoopes and former NFL player Wade Davis among them. Tuesday, Angelina Jolie made public the fact that she elected to undergo a double mastectomy, at the age of 37. This was her attempt to lower her risk of breast cancer, given the fact that she carries ""the breast cancer gene."" She hopes to encourage other women to consider the potentially life-saving procedure for themselves. No doubt, other women will now come forward. A new list of celebrity names will coalesce. What is particularly remarkable about the public statement made by Angelina Jolie is that she is a young, beautiful, sex symbol. She risks her career by changing her image in this way. To medicalize her breasts in the public's perception is potentially to de-sexualize them. The bodily care of cancer prevention is far from the glamorous dream world that Hollywood sells. Clearly, Jolie has chosen the high moral ground of trying to save lives by publicizing the procedure and stating that she feels as beautiful as ever. We should be grateful for her straightforward and courageous statement. Indeed, we should be grateful for all -- celebrities or not --who have driven social change by publicly outing themselves. It is arguable that we might not have had as much support for abortion reform, or addiction treatment, or HIV-AIDS research, or marriage equality, without them. Destigmatizing cancer prevention surgery will happen more quickly if celebrities and others get publicly vocal about their personal health choices. Sambolin: I feel empowered, supported in cancer fight . Importantly, abortion and addiction and HIV-AIDS and love are different issues from preventative mastectomy. Abortion is a difficult but fundamentally ordinary choice in an untenable situation. Addiction is a disease that is relatively well understood, even if it is still difficult to treat. HIV-AIDS is a global pandemic that is by now well known. Marriage equality is a function of health and happiness in the first place. But the phenomenon of breast cancer still eludes scientists. We still do not know how to prevent it or reliably cure it, save perhaps by surgically removing a vulnerable organ. Furthermore, it seems that a lot of our current ideas about it are not even correct. While the public receives the message that getting regular mammograms is an effective preventive strategy, it has recently been reported that such screenings turn out to be only minimally effective in lowering the morbidity of the disease. As Peggy Orenstein wrote in the New York Times, our war against cancer has been a ""feel-good war."" In fact, given the incidence of false positives, and of cancers that do not actually need to be treated, such screenings can cause harm. According to a survey of 30 years of screening published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2012, as cited by Orenstein, ""mammography's impact is decidedly mixed: it does reduce, by a small percentage, the number of women who are told they have late-stage cancer, but it is far more likely to result in over diagnosis and unnecessary treatment, including surgery, weeks of radiation and potentially toxic drugs."" When a celebrity such as Angelina Jolie makes such a generous and powerful intervention, it is right for the world to pay attention. But the list needs to grow longer, as well, of those demanding greatly increased support for primary cancer research and stricter environmental controls on the toxic substances we eat and breathe. Cancer needs a social movement demanding change. Otherwise, no matter how many celebrities and others come courageously forward, and how well the world adapts to preventive mastectomy, it will not be enough. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Laura Wexler.","Laura Wexler: Angelina Jolie deserves credit for disclosing her preventive mastectomy .

"(CNN) -- As with many murder-suicides, the gunman in the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting took to his grave the reasons that compelled him to kill more than two dozen people before taking his own life in the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. But those who knew the shooter struggled to reconcile the difference between the quiet, withdrawn 20-year-old without a criminal record and the man who wore black fatigues and a military vest and brought death to Sandy Hook Elementary School Friday. Police say the shooter, Adam Lanza, killed his mother, Nancy, in their home before walking into the school and fatally shooting 26 more people -- 20 of them children no older than 7. The rampage ended when Lanza apparently took his own life in a classroom. With him were three firearms: a semiautomatic .223-caliber rifle made by Bushmaster and two handguns, a Glock and a Sig Sauer. Connecticut law requires gun owners to be at least 21. The guns, authorities said, belonged to his mother. Police have yet to disclose whether they know a motive for the attack, which has left those who knew Lanza trying to discern whether anything in his past could have foreshadowed the present. ""He was a shy kid, quiet,"" said Alan Diaz who knew Lanza several years ago. ""He would sometimes stand in the corner. We knew he was socially awkward and we just accepted it. But he was never threatening."" Diaz told CNN that he tried many times to to talk to Lanza to ""try to include him."" Comforting survivors: 'Hug them' and 'cry with them' 'Definitely the challenge of the family' Lanza moved to Connecticut from Kingston, New Hampshire, with his parents and older brother Ryan, according to a booklet for Newtown's Bennetts Farm neighborhood. He enjoyed soccer, skateboarding and video games, the publication said. In September 2009, when Lanza was 17, his mother and father divorced, court documents show. What happened in the young man's life after that isn't clear, except that he continued to live in Newtown. His father, Peter Lanza, remarried and moved to an area not far from the town, an official said. Peter Lanza was questioned by authorities after the shooting, as was Adam Lanza's 24-year-old brother, Ryan. Authorities have offered few details about Adam Lanza. He had no known criminal record, a law enforcement official said. One of Lanza's aunts, Marsha, described him as a ""quiet, nice kid"" who had issues with learning, she said. Her husband is Lanza's paternal uncle. ""He was definitely the challenge of the family in that house. Every family has one,"" she told CNN affiliate WLS. ""They have one. I have one. But never in trouble with the law, never in trouble with anything."" She said Lanza's mother ""battled"" with the school board and had to home-school her son. ""She had issues with school,"" said the aunt, who lives in Crystal Lake, Illinois. ""I'm not 100% certain if it was behavior or learning disabilities, but he was a very, very bright boy. He was smart."" Slain Connecticut principal just implemented new security system . A 'genius' Alex Israel was in the same class at Newtown High School with Lanza and lived a few houses down from him. ""You could definitely tell he was a genius,"" Israel told CNN, adding she hadn't talked with him since middle school. ""He was really quiet, he kept to himself."" Alan Diaz said he was in the Technology Club with Lanza at Newtown High School. The group broadcast sports and other school events at school, and worked on computers. Because Diaz was one of the few students at school who talked to Lanza, Diaz said, he thought Adam probably considered him a friend. ""Eventually he started opening up more to us on the tech team, telling us jokes even,"" Diaz recalled. ""I never would have thought he was capable of something like this,"" he said. ""I once wondered that if he became isolated he might hurt himself, but never another person."" Diaz recalled that Lanza loved to wear khakis with a belt and green plaid shirt. ""He had a briefcase, really a laptop bag all the time,"" Diaz recalled. ""He was smart. I would call him a genius."" Lanza took honors classes and once taught other students how to build a computer. ""He was really into it and very good at that class,"" Diaz said. Diaz ran into Nancy Lanza, Adam's mother, not too long ago, he said. ""When I talked to Nancy that time, about how he was doing, she said he's been going to the (gun) range a lot recently,"" Diaz said. ""That he'd taken that up as a hobby."" As a 13-year-old, Lanza would occasionally ride the bus to school, often sitting in the back, usually alone, said his former bus driver. ""He didn't sit with the other kids and didn't seem to have any friends,"" said Marsha Moskowitz, 52, who said she drove Lanza to school for three years. ""He was quiet, a very shy and reserved kid,"" she said, noting that Lanza was one of the older kids on the bus and did little to interact with the others. ""No 13-year-old wants to ride the bus to school. It's kind of embarrassing for them."" The shooter's mother was also a quiet woman, said Moskowitz, though she admits she had limited interactions with her. A 'polite' mother . ""I didn't know (Nancy) as well as the other parents, but she was always very polite,"" said Moskowitz, who said she's been devastated by the news. How do we stop the violence? A relative told investigators that Lanza had a form of autism, according to a law enforcement official, who spoke under condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the investigation. But a national autism committee cautioned against speculating about a link between autism and violence. ""Autism is not a mental health disorder -- it is a neurodevelopmental disorder,"" said the Autism Research Institute's Autistic Global Initiative Project. ""The eyes of the world are on this wrenching tragedy -- with 1 in 88 now diagnosed, misinformation could easily trigger increased prejudice and misunderstanding."" A former classmate told CNN affiliate WCBS that Lanza ""was just a kid"" -- not a troublemaker. ""I don't know who would do anything like this,"" the ex-classmate said, before walking away distraught. ""This is unspeakable."" Lanza's father was also at a loss for explanation. He sent his condolences to the families of victims in a statement released Saturday. ""Our family is grieving along with all those who have been affected by this enormous tragedy,"" Peter Lanza said. ""No words can truly express how heartbroken we are. We are in a state of disbelief and trying to find whatever answers we can."" In New Hampshire, relatives of Nancy Lanza released a statement in which they, too, expressed shock and sadness. ""On behalf of Nancy's mother and siblings we reach out to the community of Newtown and express our heartfelt sorrow for the incomprehensible and profound loss of innocence that has affected so many."" How you can help . CNN's Susan Candiotti, Mary Snow and Lisa Desjardins reported from Newtown, Connecticut.

"London (CNN) -- What has happened to my country? This last fortnight has made me feel like a foreigner in my own home as a collective wave of happy-clappy good will descended on this once curmudgeonly isle. Where has our natural suspicion of organized fun gone, our disdain for overt displays of emotion, our celebration of hapless failures. It's easier for my fellow cynics, most of whom probably fled these shores long before the official sponsors parked their corporate juggernauts on our lawns and the athletes arrived for the glorified sports day known as the Olympic Games. But I had to remain in London to help with CNN's coverage of the spectacle, and boy was it tough seemingly being in a minority of one. The singer Morrissey reliably poured his usual words of scorn on the parade, criticizing the ""blustering jingoism."" He added: ""Has England ever been quite so foul with patriotism?"" But while I secretly sympathized with him, I bet he didn't have to run the gauntlet of thousands of smiling flag-waving enthusiasts on London's public transport system every day of the Games. It was bad enough in 1997, following the death of Princess Diana, when a similar wave of hysteria overtook Britain. Then, complete strangers cried together and hugged each other in the street, as they mourned a pampered princess whom they had never met. Commentators opined on page after page that Britain had entered a new era in which adults were able to discuss the hitherto taboo issue of emotions in public. Many of us hoped they were wrong. But this time it's far, far worse. Not only are we all supposed to rejoice that Â£9 billion of taxpayers' money has been spent tarting up part of east London that I have never visited and now have even less reason to go there, we must all celebrate and cry uncontrollably when sports men and women win events that I have never even heard of. Coxless fours? Taekwondo? Handball? I wouldn't have minded if there were real sports in the Olympics -- crazy golf, kite-flying, staring contests to name just three of my favorites -- but many of the events that really took place are just crazy. Before the Games, I was quite hopeful that something would go marvelously wrong in the British tradition. We'd got the dates wrong, and it's actually taking place next year. The swimming pool would spring a leak. The medals hadn't been made. But oh no, everything went to plan -- IT DIDN'T EVEN RAIN -- and suddenly we're a ""nation at ease with itself."" But before you board your flight home and hail Britain's flawless organization skills, spare a thought for curmudgeons like me. And now you've had your fun, please make sure you clear up all your mess, and turn out the lights. The show's over! Normal service can resume.","Peter Wilkinson: Good will descended on this once curmudgeonly isle .

"(CNN) -- Pour yourself a cold martini, make sure it's extra dry, put some classic jazz on the stereo, a mournful saxophone is a must, and settle in with one of the best-reviewed novels of the year, ""Rules of Civility."" Written by first-time novelist Amor Towles, a principal at a Manhattan investment firm, the book has shot up the best-seller charts and is drawing rave reviews from critics. It's a nostalgic love letter to New York of the late '30s, a novel of manners with lofty aspirations that evokes some of the classics of American literature. The story unfolds largely in flashback, set on New Year's Eve in Manhattan 1937. The Jazz Age is over, the Depression in its final days, World War II just over the horizon. At its outset, there is a budding love triangle between Katey Kontent, that's ""kon-tent, like the state of being""; her boardinghouse roommate, Eve; and a handsome banker, Theodore ""Tinker"" Grey, but an unexpected accident sends the story in a more serious direction. Katey is the narrator and the wry heart of this novel. She's a young woman of ""poise and purpose."" Brooklyn-born, the daughter of immigrant laborers, she works in a Wall Street secretarial pool though aspires to much more. Alongside a supporting cast with WASPy nicknames like Dicky, Bitsy and Peaches, Katey navigates her way through Manhattan jazz clubs and Long Island cocktail parties and into the upper echelons of New York society. The novel takes its title from young George Washington's ""Rules of Civility & Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation""; you'll find all 110 of them in the novel's appendix. These rules are described as ""a do-it-yourself charm school. A sort of How to Win Friends and Influence People 150 years ahead of its time."" Towles gives a knowing nod to some classic American authors, no less than F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and Edith Wharton among them, but this book is much more than an homage. It's a discourse on wealth and privilege, aspirations and envy, loyalty and reinventing oneself and how a chance encounter or a snap decision made at a young age can shape your life for decades to come. CNN recently spoke to Towles about his bestselling novel. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: You're a 46-year-old investment professional. What led you to write your first novel? Towles: I've been writing fiction since I was a kid. From the age of 15 to 25, I probably wrote more than 50 short stories, one of which was published in ""the Paris Review"" in 1989. Then in my late 30s and early 40s, I wrote a novel set in the farmlands of Stalinist Russia, which I stuck in a drawer. So when I finished the manuscript for ""Rules of Civility,"" it was the first thing I had submitted for publication in almost 20 years. One reason for the long hiatus is that I have been an investment professional since my mid-20s. My personal challenge as an artist has been having a day job which is intellectually satisfying and fun -- and thus can easily supplant the desire to make art. But the benefit of having that career has been that I could write without an overwhelming sense of urgency to be published. I could just keep refining my craft until I was convinced I had something worth sharing. CNN: What made you choose New York City in 1938 as the setting for your novel? Towles: While I began writing ""Rules of Civility"" in 2006, the genesis of the book dates back to the early 1990s, when I happened upon a copy of ""Many Are Called,"" the collection of portraits that Walker Evans took on the New York City subways in the late 1930s with a hidden camera. At the time, I primarily knew of Evans' iconic Depression-era photographs of rural America, such as those that appear in ""Let Us Now Praise Famous Men"": the tilting clapboard houses, weathered signs, stalwart women in summer dresses, but this was the first I'd seen of his urban work. The subway photos weren't shown publicly until the 1960s, and, as I flipped through the pages, I had the fanciful notion of someone at the exhibit's opening recognizing the same person in two of the portraits. When I set out to write a novel in 2006, I returned to this old idea -- which necessarily took me back to New York in the late '30s. Beyond that, I've always had a great interest in the period between 1900 and 1940, because it was a period of such incredible creative combustion. In retrospect, the pace of change in the arts and industry in the 19th century seems pretty glacial. Painting, music, the novel, architecture were all evolving, but at a pretty observable pace. Then in the span of a few decades, you have James Joyce, Nijinsky, cubism, surrealism, jazz, Henry Ford, Sigmund Freud, the rise of socialism, movies, airplanes, skyscrapers and the general upending of received forms in almost every area of human endeavor. New York was certainly one of the global centers in which these changes were taking shape, making it an inviting setting. CNN: Your narrator, Katey Kontent, is such an appealing character with a very distinctive voice. Was she modeled on anyone in your life? Towles: None of the characters in the book is based on anyone in particular. But three of my grandparents and a great-grandmother lived into their late 90s or early 100s. My maternal grandparents lived across the street from me in the summers, and I'd see them every day. Over lunch when I was in my 20s, it was great fun to talk with them about their lives between the wars, when they were young adults. My grandmother, who was simultaneously a woman of manners and verve, fended off marriage proposals until she was 30 because she was having too much fun to settle down. Like the book's narrator, Katey, she pushed a rival in furs into the drink before ultimately accepting my grandfather's proposal. CNN: While there's a very retro appeal to the book, it still has a very modern feel. Do you think your story could have taken place in today's New York? Towles: I certainly hope so. I think the book's themes of self-invention, aspiration, love and loss are as pertinent in today's New York as they were a century ago. Certainly, the composition of America's social strata has changed in meaningful ways since the first half of the century. The Second World War and the GI Bill were great leveling influences, in which many working-class individuals migrated from their ethnic communities towards a more homogenous middle class. At the same time, the aristocratic families of the 1920s began to abandon the outward pomp of cotillions and tails. Wonder Bread, Budweiser and Chock Full o' Nuts found their place in pantries high and low (with consistency and low price being attained at the expense of differentiation and flavor). This convergence has had weird byproducts: The vast of majority of Americans, spanning a wide array of economics (from the statistically rich to the statistically poor), now identify themselves as ""middle class."" And where in the first half of the century the struggling youth would have aspired to the narrow circles of aristocracy, in recent decades the affluent youth have aspired to the fashion and cadences of the streets. But having made these rough generalizations about transformation, I'd say that many aspects of 1930s social behavior prevail. We clearly still live in an aspirational society. We have just exited half a decade when virtually every tier of the American population has borrowed money in order to buy bigger cars and bigger houses with better fixtures. And we still have American youth in pursuit of success and stature, though success and stature today may mean wearing sneakers at a startup rather than a tuxedo at a country club. One interesting aspect of New York in particular is that it is a leading capital for advertising, art, broadcasting, fashion, finance, food, journalism, music, publishing, theater, etc. This means that every year, young people from all over the world with very different backgrounds, interests and ambitions descend on the city. They are all looking to establish connections (in the E.M. Forester sense as well as the networking sense), which provides the city with a unique chemistry. This, too, is a Manhattan reality that has persisted for generations. CNN: ""Rules of Civility"" has received some high praise and been compared to classics like ""The Great Gatsby,"" ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and ""The House of Mirth,"" among others. What do you think about these comparisons? Towles: I understand why the book's subject matter has prompted these comparisons, but I really didn't think too much about the great authors of the New York scene while I was writing the book. At the onset, I had my premise from the Walker Evans' photos (of an individual undergoing transformation in 1938 New York) and my narrator (with her wry, ambitious intellect and sharp moral compass), and I tried to let all else spring essentially from those elements. I suppose I also claimed the period as my own through invention. Perhaps I didn't struggle too much with comparison because I am such a lover of collage. Whether it's the works of the early Dadaists or the boxes of Joseph Cornell or sampling in contemporary music, I enjoy experiencing the successful integration of one work of art into another. I have hundreds of influences at this stage of my life, and I am constantly collaging them into my work while still hoping to fashion something new.

"(CNN) -- If you listen to the groupthink echo-chamber know-it-alls in Washington, the Republican Party has been decimated, destroyed, discombobulated and utterly distressed to the point of putting a ""going out of business"" sign out front and closing up shop for good. Reality says that's ridiculous. On the national level, the GOP controls the U.S. House of Representatives while Democrats control the U.S. Senate and the Oval Office. But the real power for the Republicans is on the state level, and there they are dominating Democrats. Republicans control the governor's mansion in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Folks, that's 30 out of the 50 states in the nation. The Democrats have governors in 19 states. (Rhode Island's governor is an independent.) What about both chambers on the state level? The GOP controls the legislature in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Count 'em up and that's 26. The Democrats control 18 legislatures. Five of the remaining six are split between the two chambers and one has a nonpartisan, one-chamber legislature. So much of the national media attention is always focused on what's happening in Washington, but that is a common mistake that the political bosses keep making. Every Sunday show on broadcast and cable parades the usual suspects from the U.S. Senate and sometimes a few influential U.S. House members, but it would make far more sense to be talking to governors, key state officials and mayors for a real understanding of what's happening in America. The GOP has been doing a lot of soul-searching and head-scratching since Mitt Romney was pummeled by President Barack Obama in November. Republican Party leaders are being told that they must soften their stance on gay and lesbian issues, flip the script on immigration reform, stop dissing women at every turn, and become more ""compassionate"" -- like George W. Bush when he was selling his candidacy in 2000. On Monday, the Republican National Committee announced its 2012 election postmortem, which called for, among other things, an aggressive new push to reach minorities in the states. Meanwhile, Democrats are giddy, believing they have found a winning formula for the next generation by turning out young folks, gay and lesbian folks, black voters, Latino voters and lots of women. Sure, that coalition worked well for Obama, but there is no guarantee it will be the key to success for the next Democratic presidential candidate. So while Democrats salivate at the prospect of winning the White House in 2016, Republicans continue to lay the groundwork for taking over the state houses and gubernatorial mansions, and building a formidable team of next-generation politicians to dominate there and in the White House. In fact, many Republicans have told me they couldn't care less about Washington, because legislation with real impact is being proposed and passed in the states. That's why you've seen groups quietly backing initiatives on the state level and bypassing the hot lights and screaming media in Washington. The real battles on same-sex marriage, abortion, education, spending, labor unions, and, yes, the Affordable Care Act are happening state by state. And Democrats are being caught flat-footed because they ignored the admonition of former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean to create a 50-state party, and instead, created a party that cared more about Congress and the White House. Think about it: Obama won Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Nevada, all states with GOP governors. So clearly voters in those states chose the Republican alternative in statewide elections, but when it came to the presidency, said ""No thanks."" I'm not buying for a second this silly notion that the GOP will have a Damascus Road experience and drastically change. It's not going to happen. There will be some movement on the national level, but Republican grass-roots organizers are very well aware that the message the GOP is selling statewide is a winning formula. Trust me, Republicans are concocting other pieces of legislation to bring change on the state level, regardless of what's happening in Washington. The political adage ""All politics is local"" has not changed. Maybe more of my brothers and sisters in Washington need to get outside the Beltway, hit the road and discover the far more expansive America that is happening outside Washington, Maryland, Virginia, New York and New Jersey. If they do, they'll find out that the conventional wisdom is pretty much worthless.","Roland Martin: Political echo chamber says GOP doomed by its losses in 2012 election .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Showtime made it official Thursday that ""Dexter's"" eighth season will be its last one, while teasing fans with a video clip from June's season premiere. Les Moonves, president of Showtime's parent company CBS Corp., had already let it slip in an interview last month that the cable network was pulling the plug on the successful series. Season 8 debuts Sunday, June 30, the cable network said in a news release Thursday. The clip posted online ""gives fans a sneak peek into the mindset of Dexter and Debra Morgan after LaGuerta's death in Season 7,"" Showtime's release said. Debra, Dexter's adoptive sister, killed Capt. LaGuerta in the final episode of Season 7 to save Dexter from being found out as a serial killer. Dexter tracks Debra down in a grocery store. He tells her he's been worried because she's not returned his calls for weeks and she missed LaGuerta's memorial service. ""Jesus Christ, I wonder why,"" she said. Debra tells Dexter she's avoiding him ""because you made me compromise everything about myself that I care about, and I hate you for it."" ""No, you don't,"" Dexter replies. ""I shot the wrong person in that trailer,"" Debra says. ""Dexter"" grew into a hit for Showtime since its debut in 2006, both with ratings and awards. The show won a Peabody while earning 25 Emmy nominations.

"(CNN) -- The man accused of opening fire at a Colorado movie theater wanted to study ""the primary source of all things, our own minds,"" according to a personal statement he submitted as part of a graduate studies application. The application included the statement, professional references and test scores. It offered new details into the background of James Holmes, 24, the man charged with killing 12 people and wounding 58 others at an Aurora multiplex. The documents were released Friday by the University of Illinois, where Holmes applied to the neuroscience department before opting to attend the University of Colorado. The application, part of 176 pages released by the university, was first obtained by The News-Gazette in Champaign, Illinois. While the documents do little to answer questions about the alleged suspect's possible motive in the July 20 shooting during a showing of the Batman movie at the Century 16 multiplex, they offer new insight into Holmes as a student and his aspirations to study the human brain. In the statement, Holmes wrote that he has long been ""fascinated by the complexities of long lost thought seemingly arising out of nowhere into stream of awareness. ""These fascinations likely stemmed from my interest in puzzles and paradoxes as an adolescent and continued through my curiosity in academic research,"" he wrote in the statement submitted in early 2011. He titled his resume ""aspiring scientist."" Holmes was described as taking ""an active role in his education, and brings a great amount of intellectual and emotional maturity into the classroom,"" according to a letter of reference that appeared to be from one of his former professors. Media urge unsealing of documents in Colorado shooting case . As part of his graduate studies application, Holmes submitted a photo of himself offering a piece of straw to a llama. The move caught the attention of Samuel Beshers, the university's neuroscience program coordinator, who pointed Holmes application to a colleague in an e-mail. ""You can't miss the llama,"" Beshers wrote. One staff member, whose name was redacted from the documents, took to referring to Holmes as ""the llama"" in communication with others at the university. ""Do you have any of llama's travel details for next week?"" one e-mail said. According to e-mails released by the University of Illinois, Holmes visited the Urbana-Champaign campus in March 2011 and met with professors, research assistants and Beshers while touring the facilities.

Holmes appears to have been accepted for admission, about the same time, to the University of Colorado's neuroscience program at the Anschutz campus in Aurora.

Holmes withdrew from the neuroscience program in June, a month before the shooting, though gave no reason for his withdrawal, said Jacque Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the University of Colorado. Colorado authorities have declined to comment on a possible motive, citing a judge's order that sealed the court record in the case.

"(CNN) -- The head of the YWCA in Wheeling, West Virginia, has a message for rape victims: ""You are not alone. There are services available to help you. Don't suffer in silence. Reach out and get help."" Wheeling's YWCA -- 20 miles from the Ohio town of Steubenville -- has become the unexpected beneficiary of support from around the country and around the world after a highly publicized rape case. Two star high school football players were convicted Sunday of raping a drunken 16-year-old girl, identified only as Jane Doe. She has been the target of death threats this week, prompting people to come out to support her financially and in social media. Lori Jones, executive director of the Wheeling YWCA, said she has received more than 2,500 donations. ""It's been an overwhelming amount of support from the community and worldwide,"" Jones said. ""We've not even started to add it all up yet."" Bob Fitzsimmons, the victim's attorney, says he is not taking any money for the case. Any donations toward legal fees are instead being sent to the Wheeling YWCA's Madden House, an emergency shelter that offers secure housing to women and children fleeing domestic violence. ""This young girl has been a hero to a lot of people that she stood up, but it also demonstrates what women have to go through to make these allegations. It's not easy,"" Fitzsimmons said. The Wheeling YWCA also is maintaining a message board where people can leave notes of support for the victim. Thousands have left encouraging words, and they are being sent to the teen. ""People seem to need to send a message,"" Jones said. ""It's important to them that she get the feeling for how much the community and the world wants to support her."" The Wheeling YWCA serves an estimated 30,000 people a year across three counties. It also is part of a larger national movement that focuses on empowering women to change their lives for the better.

"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (CNN)  -- He's the man Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin affectionately calls her ""first dude."" Todd Palin, who grew up in Alaska, is a former oilfield worker and world-record holding snowmobile racer. Todd Palin was introduced to the nation at the Republican National Convention as a blue-collar oil worker, a laid-back father of five and a world-record-holding snowmobile racer. Todd and Sarah met in high school at a basketball game and eloped in 1988, six years after graduation. Todd grew up in Alaska and is part Eskimo. He's an avid outdoorsman and champion of the Iron Dog snowmobile race. He's worked in Alaska's oil industry and as a fisherman. But in recent times, he's had another role. Some call him the ""Shadow Governor."" In government circles and among the family's acquaintances, Todd Palin is known as his wife's greatest adviser and most loyal protector. One family friend said, ""Todd is incredibly supportive and is willing to do whatever it takes to help Sarah."" Todd may appear quiet, almost shy, but he's made quite an impression on his wife's running mate, Sen. John McCain. On the campaign trail this month in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, McCain said, ""He's not afraid of Washington, D.C.! He can take them on!"" Alaskans interviewed by CNN say Todd Palin has plenty of influence. He's not on the state payroll, but lawmakers say he is a central figure in his wife's policy agenda. Stephen Branchflower is one man who certainly thinks so. Branchflower was hired by the Alaska Legislature to investigate Governor Palin's firing of the state's top cop - Walt Monegan - and whether the Palins pressured him to fire the governor's former brother-in-law, trooper Mike Wooten. Sarah Palin has said Wooten repeatedly threatened her family amid a bitter divorce from her sister. She claims that he even threatened to kill her father, an accusation that Wooten denies. Branchflower wants to subpoena Todd Palin because the governor's husband ""has spoken to numerous government employees. ... He's such a central figure to the events."" Sarah Palin has denied exerting any pressure to have anyone fired. Todd Palin hasn't spoken publicly about the case, but his wife's attorney said Thursday Mr Palin would not comply with the subpoena request. The McCain campaign said the Legislative Council was no longer carrying out ""a legitimate investigation because it has been subjected to complete partisanship and does not operate with the authority that it had at the time of its initial authorization.""  How much power does Todd Palin have in Alaska politics? » . CNN has seen thousands of e-mails released this year from the governor's office that show that Todd Palin was copied on hundreds of them. The topics of the e-mails ranged from public criticism of Sarah Palin to her meetings with corporate leaders. Andrew Halcro, who ran as an independent against Sarah Palin for governor in 2006 and is a critic of the Palins, wants to know why Todd Palin was being copied on state correspondence. Halcro wrote a blog post about Todd Palin called ""Shadow Governor"" and says, ""Todd plays the role as kind of the fixer."" Even Halcro found himself the subject of e-mails that Todd Palin was copied on. He wants to know why. ""This whole process, and the whole string of e-mails, to me really raise some red flags,"" Halcro said. But campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton explained, ""There is spousal privilege in that the governor is asking him to print them off or take care of business."" Alaska lawmakers say Todd Palin is a fixture at the state Legislature. So much so, some say they've joked about getting buttons that read, ""What would Todd do?"" One of those lawmakers is Lyda Green, a Republican and state Senate president who is not friends with the Palins. ""I had a meeting I requested with the governor. ... I was particularly surprised that Todd was there. I had never seen a spouse stay in the room through the meeting."" The campaign said, ""Todd's role has not been inappropriate."" The campaign also confirms that Todd Palin has taken two trips with state commissioners to survey Alaskan mines and one to survey part of the proposed route for a natural gas pipeline, his wife's top goal. The state paid for those trips, according to the campaign, because they were considered ""state business"" since Todd Palin is trying to expand Alaska's work force. Now he's spending plenty of time out of state -- at his wife's side -- as she criss-crosses the country. A far cry from juggling the cooking and carpooling for their five children.","Todd Palin grew up in Alaska, is part Eskimo and a champion snowmobile racer .

"(EW.com) -- These days, there are many less flattering things you could say about a movie than that it's enjoyable in a square, uncomplicated, stirringly old-fashioned way. 42, a sports drama about how Jackie Robinson broke the color line in professional baseball, is in some ways a film that could have been made 30 years ago, or 50 years ago. (In fact, it was made 63 years ago: 1950's The Jackie Robinson Story starred the legendary second baseman himself.) The film depicts Robinson, played by the dazzling, little-known actor Chadwick Boseman, as a fearless, noble athlete-crusader — which, of course, is just what he was, though 42 scarcely spends three minutes trying to find any flaws in him (surely he must have had one), or even giving him a sprinkle of idiosyncrasy. Is the writer-director, Brian Helgeland (who wrote L.A. Confidential and directed A Knight's Tale), worried that we wouldn't admire Robinson enough? Helgeland works in what I think of as a conservative — or maybe it's just really, really basic — neoclassical Hollywood style, spelling everything out, letting the story unfold in a plainspoken and deliberate fashion, with a big, wide, open pictorial camera eye. It's like the latter-day Clint Eastwood style, applied to material that's as traditional as can be. EW: '42' aims to be box office MVP . Yet in one vital way, the movie feels very contemporary. When Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, spearheading the civil rights era before it had a name, he was subjected, on and off the field, to a degree of racial antagonism that could almost be called terrorism. For all its wholesomely uplifting, message-movie design, 42 makes that struggle look every bit as brutal and scary as it was. Robinson's fellow Dodgers, many of them Southern boys, welcome him to the team by signing a petition to have him kicked off. He's booed from the stands, pitchers take open delight in beaning him, and in one scene, when he's up at bat, the manager of the Philadelphia Phillies (Alan Tudyk) heckles him from the sidelines by calling him the N-word for five unrelenting minutes. The way that scene goes on and on is scathingly powerful, as Jackie can barely keep himself from coming apart. Boseman, a graceful and handsome actor with a deep inner fire, gives Robinson a stare that's penetrating and guarded at the same time. A lot of the film's drama is reading that face — the intelligence and masked outrage. Jackie isn't allowed to fight back against any of the viciousness (if he did, it would look to mainstream America like he was the troublemaker), yet swallowing it eats up his spirit. How does he cope? EW: 'Star Trek Into Darkness' 10 new pics . By playing the hell out of the game. Even if he hadn't been baseball's trailblazing crossover star, Robinson had a talent on the field that was explosive. He was a wizard at stealing bases, and the movie glories in his quickness and bravado — how he steps off first base and eases down the path, hopping back and forth like a jackrabbit on a hot stove, holding his arms low, letting his fingers wiggle like nervous antennae. 42 portrays this athletic showmanship with an element of racial psychodrama. Robinson isn't just teasing the pitchers (the more they look at him, the less they can tell what he's going to do next). He's mocking them, working off his anger. He triumphs, and holds on to his sanity, by beating racist players at their own game. The movie covers just three years of Robinson's life, beginning in 1945, when he's a World War II veteran playing in the Negro Leagues and gets recruited by the forward-thinking Dodgers general manager, Branch Rickey, to join his minor-league club, the Montreal Royals. As Rickey, a stogie-chomping grump with a heart of gold, Harrison Ford seems to have reinvented himself as an actor. He gives an ingeniously stylized cartoon performance, his eyes atwinkle, his mouth a rubbery grin, his voice all wily Southern music, though with that growl of Fordian anger just beneath it. Calling Robinson into his office, he tells him that he needs a player who doesn't so much have the guts to fight back as the guts not to fight back. 42 is a rousing tribute to how impossible, and therefore heroic, a stance that was.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- It was the music of rebellion and youth. Artists traded witty improvisations onstage chronicling the pain and the promise of being black in America, inspiring inner-city and rural Southern audiences alike in nightclubs and on street corners. Atlanta-based Jaspects fuses rap with jazz in hopes of preserving both genres and appealing to young people. That music was jazz. Today, Jaspects, an Atlanta-based group of young musicians who were born in the hip-hop era, fuse rap and jazz melodies to introduce younger audiences to jazz and the broader ideas regarding African-American society. For Jaspects, whose music has appeared in the movie ""Hustle & Flow"" and recently was featured in the CNN documentary series ""Black in America,"" the lessons of jazz go beyond its artistic merits to questions about the ownership and control of black music in general. Veteran saxophonist Jimmy Heath, who has performed with nearly all the jazz greats of the last 50 years, says that the music called jazz today began as a voice of the repressed. ""The history of jazz comes with the history of African-American people. Because whenever they were permitted, they always sang and played their music when they were in their own quarters, and eventually I think, when instruments were available, they started to play music on those instruments,"" Heath says. Jazz was born a raw and energetic rebuttal of what was musically acceptable at the time, and became the voice of a generation of African-American youth.  Watch as Jaspect fuses hip-hop and jazz » . Terrence Brown, pianist and musical director for Jaspects, says hip-hop shares the same roots. ""These people wanted to do more than just Bach and Beethoven. They didn't want to play history; they wanted to make history,"" Brown says. ""I guess when jazz [and] the Harlem Renaissance began to give birth people really felt the need to express themselves and that is similar to how hip-hop was created."" As jazz started to gain popularity outside of black America in the 1940s and gained an international following, many say the music became distanced from its cultural origins. In his exhaustive work on the African-American experience, ""Africana,"" Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. writes that while black musicians were the principal innovators during this era, white musicians often reaped the fame and benefits and that ""the black musicians who found greatest favor with whites were those with a happy-go-lucky air and a ready grin."" With the exception of groups such as Jaspects, jazz today is considered by Brown and some others to be a ""museum piece"" that aged instead of evolving. Brown says hip-hop is following a similar route, and he says a major reason is a lack of ownership of the music. ""Hopefully, there will come a time where a lot of African-Americans who do have money and do have the resources ... take over some of these corporations ... and not just have the No. 1 hit record on the charts, because that in itself will allow the community to give back to itself,"" Brown says. Rapper Nas, whose real name is Nasir Jones, made a provocative declaration with the release of his 2006 album, ""Hip Hop Is Dead,"" that the genre ""is dead because we no longer have the power."" At the same time, there has been a rise of prominent black music executives such as Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs, Jay-Z, Russell Simmons and Jermaine Dupri. Jay-Z and P. Diddy, who earned $34 million and $32 million, respectively, in 2007, were named hip-hop's cash kings by Forbes magazine. Dupri, owner of record label So So Def Records and producer of hits for recording artists TLC, Usher and Mariah Carey, disagrees that corporate ownership is affecting black music for the worse. ""They [corporations] have their input, but if you let the money guide you then, that's how you let them control you,"" says Dupri, who released his first book in 2007, ""Young, Rich and Dangerous: The Making of a Music Mogul."" ""If you are driven by money, then the backers that are giving you the money tell you what to do."" Dupri says that there are not enough African Americans who are in control of the music business, and that education has a lot to do with it. ""That's a lot of the problem. It's always been something that lot of people can get in quick without really doing anything, without learning, but you have to learn everything about it,"" Dupri says. Brown says he's hopeful that the rise of black leadership in music will have a positive impact on the community. ""We need to get to a place where we own our own things as African-Americans and a place that the things we do generate money for our own communities,"" Brown says. ""Not only that, but that we generate a sense of culture, style and substance for our community."" Jaspects and groups like them are hoping to change things a little. Using hip-hop, the music of rebellion and youth in 2008, they are introducing jazz to a new generation -- to tell its story, preserve its artistry and learn its lessons.","Atlanta-based group Jaspects fuses rap, jazz to attract younger audiences .

"(CNN) -- The videos, pictures and tweets are chilling. A picture of a girl dangling limply from the arms of two young men. Other boys, laughingly saying the girl had to be dead because she didn't flinch as her body was violated. An alleged rape, made into a joke. The images and social media messages are at the heart of criminal charges against two high school football players accused of sexually assaulting an underage teenage girl during a series of end-of-summer parties in August. Both boys are charged with rape. One also is accused of ""illegal use of a minor in nudity-oriented material."" Their trial before an Ohio juvenile court judge is scheduled for February 13. CNN is not identifying the girl, who is a juvenile, in accordance with its policy not to release the names of alleged rape victims. The alleged attackers also are juveniles, but they have been identified by a judge in court, by defense attorneys and in newspapers and other media reports as Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, both 16. The case has attracted the attention of bloggers and even Anonymous, a loosely organized cooperative of activist hackers. Anonymous has released information about the town and the football team and is threatening to release more unless everyone comes clean about what happened that August night. ""The town of Steubenville has been good at keeping this quiet and their star football team protected,"" an Anonymous member wearing the group's trademark Guy Fawkes mask says in a video posted to the group's LocalLeaks website. The organization, he says, will not allow ""a group of young men who turn to rape as a game or sport get the pass because of athletic ability or small-town luck."" The girl was assaulted the night of Saturday, August 11, and early the next morning, according to authorities. Involved, according to authorities, were members of the Steubenville High School football team, demigods in the small, down-on-its-luck town along the banks of the Ohio River. A website dedicated to the team counts down the seconds to their return next fall. Police got involved on August 14, when the girl's mother came forward to report the alleged assault, according to Steubenville police Chief William McCafferty. The family provided a zip drive showing a Twitter page, possibly with a photo, the chief told CNN. A kidnapping charge was dropped by the Juvenile Court judge at a probable cause hearing last October, said McCafferty and Mays's attorney, Adam Nemann. ""My client asserts his innocence, and he looks forward to his day in court,"" said Nemann. At an October hearing, attorney Walter Madison, who is representing Richmond, raised questions about the alleged victim's actions that night, according to CNN affiliate WTOV. On August 27, the same day authorities charged the two defendants, Jefferson County authorities asked for help from the attorney general's office in investigating and prosecuting the case. Interviews and witness statements led to the arrests, McCafferty said. ""What we want is to be able to show the citizens of Jefferson County that everything that can be done in this case is being done, and if that means eliciting the help of these people from the attorney general's office, then that's what we want to do in this case,"" county prosecutor Jane Hanlin told WTOV at the time. By that time, images and messages from that night had made their way around social media. Crime blogger Alexandria Goddard, a former Steubenville resident, discovered and preserved many of the messages, at least some of which are now in the hands of authorities. She first spotted the story in the small town's newspaper and started looking into the situation on a hunch that the highly regarded football team's members were getting special treatment at the expense of the victim. ""When I first came across the article, I just felt like -- because it was involving football players, and there is a culture there that football is very important, that there was probably a little more to this story than what the local media was reporting,"" she told CNN Thursday. ""So I started doing my own research."" One image circulated online and posted on a website maintained by Anonymous showed the girl, dressed in a T-shirt and blue shorts, her body limp, being held hand and foot by two males who appear to be teenagers. Text messages posted to social networking sites that night seemed to brag about the incident, calling the girl ""sloppy,"" making references to rape and suggesting even that she had been urinated on, according to Goddard. CNN has not been able to establish whether this is true. In one 12-minute video, posted by Anonymous on Wednesday, one teenager makes joke after joke about the girl's condition, saying she must have died because she didn't move during one assault. Anonymous and others in the video identified the teen by a name that doesn't match the two who were charged, but CNN cannot independently confirm his identity. ""Is it really rape because you don't know if she wanted to or not,"" the teenager says on the video. ""She might have wanted to. That might have been her final wish."" Other male voices can be heard off-camera, laughing and talking about the alleged assault. McCafferty said he cannot say who shot that video. ""The subject in that video was interviewed. He wasn't charged,"" the chief told CNN. ""The attorney general's office has all this. It appears to me after I watched the video he was intoxicated."" The New York Times reported that a cell phone photo from that night shows the girl naked on the floor. Roughly 11 cell phones and a couple of iPads were seized during the investigation, said McCafferty, adding he was not involved in retrieving evidence from the electronic devices. McCafferty said ""there was evidence on some of the phones."" A special unit with the attorney general's office is doing the work, the chief said. McCafferty said there was a report of a video showing the alleged attack, but authorities don't have it or know whether it exists. The attorney for the girl's family told CNN that the girl is in counseling and is ""doing as well as one can expect."" ""She's trying to go about her life right now, which is difficult because of all the media attention,"" said family attorney Robert Fitzsimmons. ""It's as if she's just flown into this barnstorm. She'll make it through."" The case is now in the hands of special prosecutors under Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. DeWine said that the case is being aggressively prosecuted and remains under active investigation. ""We want to make sure that there is no stone left unturned,"" he said. ""We want to make sure that every one in the community really feels that justice has been done and that all the information does in fact come out."" The parents of one teenager named on Goddard's blog sued her for defamation and sought to have those who anonymously commented on the blog about the case publicly identified. The family has since dropped the lawsuit, according to court documents. Meanwhile, Anonymous says it is collecting detailed information about the personal affairs of football boosters and others in the town of 18,000 who the group claims may have helped cover up the attack. It's also planning a protest ""to help those who have been victimized by the football team or other regimes."" The group has already hacked the website of the local football fansite and says it will release the information if people don't come forward to help the investigation. ""My heart goes out to the victim,"" DeWine said. ""The victim continues to be victimized every time something shows up on the Internet. There's nothing I can do about that, but it is very, very sad."" CNN's Ross Levitt and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report .","Ohio state authorities are investigating an alleged rape .

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Chanthu has slowed, but it's edging ominously closer to an area of southern China already deluged with rain and deadly floods. ""The situation is grave,"" said China's State Council, or cabinet, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. The council is urging local governments to step up flood control efforts. Xinhua, quoting newly released government figures, said torrential rains and floods this year already have been the worst in a decade, claiming the lives of 701 people and leaving 347 missing, . Now, Chanthu could drench some already rain-swollen areas with another 20 inches, or half meter, of rain, according to CNN Weather Anchor Jenny Harrison. Harrison said Chanthu has slowed over the last 24 hours and now is expected to make landfall Thursday evening, local time. It's moving north-northwest at five miles an hour and is expected to come ashore between Guangdong's coastal city of Yangjiang and Hainan's Qionghai City. But Hong Kong, to the east, also is expected to feel the storm's fury, as well as northern Vietnam. Chanthu already has been pounding Hainan Island, off the coast, with sustained winds of 68 miles an hour and gusts reaching 87 miles an hour. But as the storm moves inland, an area of particular concern is the region along the Yangtze River, which already has experienced the worst flooding in 30 years. Floodgates on the Three Gorges Dam have been opened to control the flow, and pictures from the scene show huge volumes of water pouring from it. Throughout the country, floods have hit 27 provinces and municipalities, affecting 110 million people, according to Xinhua. It said more than 8 million people have been relocated. About 287,000 military personnel have been mobilized in anti-flood operations, and schools are being advised to do what they can to ensure students' safety. Xinhua also said the Qiongzhou Strait between the Chinese mainland and Hainan island was closed Wednesday as Chanthu headed toward south China.

"(CNN) -- Cuban state media released a message from Fidel Castro, the first communique said to be from the ex-leader since speculation over his health reached a fever pitch last week. There were no new images of Castro, 86, released Wednesday. He has not been seen publicly since March, when he met with Pope Benedict XVI during the pontiff's visit to Cuba. Castro's usually frequent newspaper columns and musings suddenly ended in June. But his silence after the re-election of close ally Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in October prompted many of his opponents to wonder whether Castro was again ailing or perhaps dead. ""The comandante is well, following his daily routine, reading, exercising,"" Alex Castro, one of Castro's sons, told Cuban state media after the reports of his ill health. Still, a barrage of postings on Twitter and other social media had Castro at death's door. Castro never fully recovered after a botched surgery for a still unknown intestinal illness in 2006. Two years later, his brother Raul Castro officially succeeded him. In the message on Wednesday, Castro reportedly congratulated doctors graduating from a Cuban medical institute on the 50th anniversary of the institute's founding. The message mentioned the 50th anniversary this week of the Cuban missile crisis and the exodus of physicians from Cuba after the 1959 revolution. On Tuesday, the Cuban government announced the lifting of some restrictions for Cubans traveling abroad.

"Beijing (CNN) -- The World Health Organization announced the launch of an international investigation into a new deadly strain of bird flu, as the total number of infections in China rose to 87. ""Right now it is still an animal virus that rarely infects humans,"" said Dr. Michael O'Leary, the head of the WHO's office in Beijing. O'Leary said one of the goals of the mission is to determine the source of the H7N9 virus which was first discovered only three weeks ago. Officials from the WHO, as well as experts from the U.S. and European Centers for Disease Control, are expected to investigate the virus alongside Chinese health authorities in Shanghai and Beijing in the coming days. Five new infections of the H7N9 virus were recorded in Shanghai and nearby provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Henan. On Thursday, the government suspended wild bird sales to try to prevent the spread of the virus, although many questions remain as to the source of infection. It follows a ban on live poultry trading in affected provinces. A large number of birds have also been slaughtered, Xinhua said. In his statement to a room packed full of journalists, O'Leary said there was legitimate reason for concern about the new virus, but suggested it was premature to begin mass culling of poultry. ""I eat chicken every day,"" O'Leary said with a laugh. ""Chicken is of no concern at all."" However, posts on the country's microblogging sites suggested that some users were anxious about going anywhere near poultry products. ""After H7N9, I don't even dare to eat an egg. I ate lunch box every day. I want poultry, and I want meat!!!"" one wrote. Another said: ""Jiaxing has H7N9 patient now, so nervous. I wasn't this nervous even during SARS."" But some were more relaxed about the potential risks: ""Everyone should be careful, but I don't think it's that big deal. It's not that scary. In 2006 during another avian flu, I was in final year of high school and my parents sent me eggs every week. I ate a lot, but I'm still fine now."" Until March, the virus had only been present in birds, which is why they've become the focus of the investigation. However, 40% of patients with H7N9 had not come into contact with poultry, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The World Health Organization says at this stage there is ""limited"" evidence of human-to-human transmission. Three clusters of infection have been identified. In each case, they involved family members living in close proximity. It was not clear whether relatives had transmitted the virus to each other, or whether they had been exposed to the same initial source of the illness. ""This becomes a different situation if the virus has human-to-human transmission,"" O'Leary said. Authorities are monitoring more than 1,000 people who have come into close contact with confirmed cases. One cluster of infection involved a family where a father and two sons fell ill. The 87-year-old father died of the virus in March, followed soon after by his younger son. It hasn't been confirmed whether the son had the illness, according to Feng Zijian, director of the health emergency center of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Because he had died, further tests weren't possible, Feng added, during a press briefing on Wednesday. The elder son was confirmed to have had the virus but has since recovered. He is one of five people who have been discharged from hospital after treatment, according to Xinhua. So far, one boy is confirmed to have been an asymptomatic carrier of the virus, meaning he tested positive for the illness but didn't display any symptoms. The discovery of an asymptomatic carrier is worrying because it could make the spread of the infection more difficult to monitor, experts say. The four-year old was part of a sweep of people tested for the illness because they'd come into close contact with the first reported case in Beijing. Authorities took throat swabs from a group of people connected to 24 poultry farmers in Naidong Village, Cuigezhuang County in Beijing's Chaoyang District, according to the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau. The WHO reported that of more than 80,000 birds tested in China, less than 40 had tested positive. Unlike previous outbreaks of other strains of bird flu, none of the infected birds showed signs of being sick.","NEW: WHO confirms start of international investigation into bird flu in China .

"London (CNN) -- The artwork for ""The Next Day,"" David Bowie's first album in 10 years and a record that nobody outside his inner circle suspected was coming, is a witty vandalization of the sleeve of 1977's ""Heroes."" As its designer, Jonathan Barnbrook, explains: The ""Heroes"" cover obscured by the white square is about the spirit of great pop or rock music which is ""of the moment,"" forgetting or obliterating the past. However, we all know that this is never quite the case, no matter how much we try, we cannot break free from the past."" Read more: David Bowie returns with new single, album . In that sense it's an unbeatable image. Bowie's glittering reputation rests on his determination, during his extraordinary run of albums in the 1970s, to escape the past and embrace the future, but he was also clever enough to realize that there's no such thing as an entirely blank slate, and that tension was the motor of his genius. The excitement surrounding his surprise comeback, after a decade of supposed retirement, reminds us that he is rock's unrivalled innovator-in-chief. His early reinventions could perhaps be explained by sheer ambition. That's why David Jones from suburban Bromley, on the southern outskirts of London, became David Bowie (rhymes with Zoe, not Maui) and then Bowie, fearing that 1969's ""Space Oddity"" would render him a one-hit wonder, became Ziggy Stardust, the first post-modern rock star. If fame was all he was looking for, he would have been happy with that, but his hunger for change exceeded his appetite for success. He killed off Ziggy after just 18 months and unveiled a series of new identities, each with its own sound. Photos: David Bowie's ever-changing look . To listen to all of Bowie's 70s albums in sequence is still a dizzying experience, because each one attempts to eclipse its predecessor. On ""Aladdin Sane"" he explored the relationship between showbusiness and mental illness. ""Diamond Dogs"" was an apocalyptic vision which spun the mid-70s' darkest fears into a kind of glam-rock opera. The ""plastic soul"" of ""Young Americans"" was his strange response to the sound of black America and ""Station to Station,"" recorded in cocaine-maddened seclusion in Los Angeles in the guise of the ""Thin White Duke,"" presaged his return to Europe. Remarkably, these page-turning albums emerged at the rate of around one a year. The only possible comparison in terms of creative momentum is the Beatles, and there were four of them. Beyond the records themselves, Bowie's restless eye for new stimuli, drawn from the worlds of cinema, theatre, fashion and visual art, made him pop's most imaginative stylist. London's V&A museum is mounting a major retrospective of his visual work this spring -- rare honor for a pop star. Read more: Bowie back after the bonds . As the artwork of ""he Next Day"" and the lyrics of comeback single ""Where Are We Now?"" suggest, Bowie's mystique resides most powerfully in the three albums he recorded in Berlin in the late 70s: ""Low,"" ""Heroes"" and ""Lodger."" Of all his rebirths this was the most radical, influential and multi-faceted. The Berlin albums are perfectly poised between art and pop, containing both avant-garde enigmas like ""Warszawa"" and glorious, gripping songs like the title track of ""Heroes,"" which sounded not at all out of place, 35 years later, as Team GB's Olympic anthem. Brian Eno, who worked on Bowie's Berlin trilogy, once compared rock music to a blank sheet of paper that was rapidly filled in and Bowie did more than anyone in the 70s to colonize that white space. Each record was, to quote one song title, a fantastic voyage, alerting other musicians to new possibilities and charting a path for entire scenes. It's impossible to imagine the landscape of early 80s pop, for example, without Bowie's influence, and you can detect his DNA in countless artists, from Pet Shop Boys to Lady Gaga, U2 to Blur, Joy Division to Nine Inch Nails, Franz Ferdinand to LCD Soundsystem. To any musician who worries about reconciling artistic integrity with commercial success, or sonic innovation with emotional truth, Bowie's 70s work is proof that, with enough talent and judgement, you can have it all. Of course records this good cast a long shadow and, to paraphrase Barnbrook, no matter how much he tried, Bowie couldn't break free from the past. While his bad albums in subsequent decades were justly criticized, his good ones were unfairly underrated. Although he remained curious, enthusiastic and eager to take risks right up to 2003's ""Reality,"" he was punished for no longer reinventing the wheel with each release. As long as Bowie was still recording regularly, all but his most devoted fans took him for granted. They won't be making that mistake again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dorian Lynskey.","David Bowie stuns rock world by releasing first new music in 10 years .

"(CNN) -- At a time when the United States is trying to figure out how to respond to threats from North Korean leaders, America and Israel are synthesizing their intelligence assessments of Iran's nuclear capability, and Americans are marking the 10th anniversary of the Iraq war, it is useful to remind ourselves of the central role that intelligence plays in trying to understand our nation's greatest threat, an enemy armed with weapons of mass destruction. Whether this intelligence turns out to be accurate or inaccurate, when trying to figure out the capabilities and intentions of hostile countries, our leaders turn to clandestinely collected information simply because they have no other way of knowing. But it is also worth remembering that the picture that intelligence paints is not a factual depiction. With solid sources and analysis rigorously tested for bias, it can be very good. But a lack of these can produce intelligence analysis that is far less certain and therefore open for interpretation from policymakers. The general public is not aware of the quality of our nation's intelligence at any given moment because it is not shared with the public, and we are forced to rely on the president's representation of the information. Not an ideal situation for a democracy -- and one that proved disastrous in the case of the Iraq War. As an intelligence analyst at the CIA, I was privy to all the intelligence analysis on Iraq in the lead-up to that war. My office covered the country analysis while other offices covered WMD and terrorism, but we read each other's work. I remember thinking at the time how paradoxical it was that we were working so hard to be thorough in our analysis for the president, but then he gave the public only a few pieces of raw intelligence reporting from a handful of sources as well as the administration's own judgments that did not reflect the complexity of our assessments. Thus the general public was given only the intelligence the Bush administration judged was most useful to characterize the danger of Saddam Hussein's regime. This was done by unilaterally declassifying secret intelligence for speeches, talk show appearances and Colin Powell's famous U.N. Security Council speech. There is a far better way to give the public a more accurate reading of threats to our national security. One needn't look any further than the Constitution. The framers created Congress to be another body, unaccountable to the executive, to be entrusted with the nation's security and with the exclusive power to make war. But for Congress to play this role in today's WMD reality, congressional leaders need to have access to the same intelligence the president has. This would allow Congress to challenge a president's characterization of a threat with the public (as well as call out a president if he isn't addressing a threat). This would provide the public a more accurate understanding of the real threats it faces and with that a greater certainty as to when we need to act. While some congressional members on the intelligence committees are getting more intelligence information today than they were before, the President's Daily Brief, with information from the nation's most sensitive sources, is still for presidential eyes only. This puts the president in the driver's seat to define our threats, determine our enemies and tell the public what he thinks we need to do about it. In the case of the Iraq war, by the time Congress began to take a more active role and summoned the now infamous National Intelligence Estimate, they were not in a position to function as a ""balance"" to the executive branch and ""check"" that branch's characterization of Hussein as an imminent threat. The Bush administration had already released most of the damning intelligence to the public, creating enough fear to convince many Americans that Hussein was ""very likely"" to give WMD to terrorists. It would have been far better to have trusted the public with the CIA analysts' full assessments than for the individual, sometimes uncorroborated pieces of raw intelligence to be released to the public without any analysis or context. The public would have had to wrestle with the complexity, the uncertainties and in some cases the limited availability of sources that was the intelligence picture on Iraq in 2002-2003. I am not advocating for this type of complete intel-sharing with the public in the future. Releasing top secret information to the public risks lives and collection methods and is clearly unwise. Congress, as the body representing the public, can and should serve this function. But unless Congress' access to intelligence is on par with the president's, you can forget what you read in the Constitution; information is power and the branch with the most classified intelligence is king and alone makes war. Congress, and by default, the public, are largely irrelevant. Fear should not compel us to go to war. A decision of that consequence should only follow a rigorous debate among all of our leaders on the necessity for war based on the best information available. And while they're at it, a debate on the quality of that information as well. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elizabeth C. MacKenzie Biedell.","Elizabeth Biedell: In major foreign policy decisions, intelligence plays a key role .
Presidents get the fullest description of what intelligence agencies know .

"(CNN) -- China's ambassador to Japan is rejecting Tokyo's protest over the patrol of Chinese navy ships near a group of islands disputed by Japan, China and Taiwan. Japan accused the Chinese navy of using radar to gather information on the location of a Japanese escort vessel and a helicopter. The type of radar used could be used to produce data needed to fire upon the Japanese equipment. Dispute explained: How a remote rock split China and Japan . The Japanese foreign ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador for a meeting Tuesday to lodge a formal protest regarding the accusations. The Chinese actions were unusual and one false step could lead to a dangerous situation, Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onoder said Tuesday. Japan repels Taiwan activists near disputed islands . China countered that it has been conducting regular patrols in Chinese waters and asked Japan not to interfere. ""We think the top priority for now is for Japan to stop all provocative actions it has been doing as sending ships and flights into Diaoyu islands sea and air space,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said, referring to the disputed islands. ""We hope Japan can take actions to show sincerity and willingness to work with China through talks and negotiations to control and manage the current situation."" The Japanese call the uninhabited islands the Senkakus. Near them are important shipping lanes, rich fishing grounds and possible oil deposits. Asia's disputed islands -- who claims what? Disagreement over who owns them strained relations between Japan and China during the latter half of 2012, and the dispute shows no signs of waning. In another show of force, China's navy conducted drills in the South China Sea over the weekend, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The drill included a scenario in which a helicopter crew identified a target and prepared to fire a missile, and another in which crews responded to a fire on a ship. Protests flared across China in September, soon after Japan announced it had bought several of the disputed islands from private Japanese owners. The deal was struck in part to prevent the islands from being bought by Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara, who had called for donations for a public fund to buy them. Dangerous Rocks: Can both sides back off peacefully? China was outraged, as were protesters who marched through several Chinese cities calling for boycotts of Japanese products and urging the government to give the islands back. In December, the dispute escalated when Japan scrambled fighter jets after a Chinese plane was seen near the islands. A number of Chinese ships have also entered contested waters despite warnings from the Japanese Coast Guard. China says its claim extends back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a breakaway province, also lays claim to the islands. But the self-governing island has seldom rigorously advanced its claims because of an unwillingness to risk its good relationship with Japan, said Alan Dupont, a strategic analyst at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. He said last year that Taiwan's decision to become more assertive was a response to actions taken by China and Japan in the second half of 2012, as well as concerns over access to fishing and marine resources.","China rejects complaints about its navy patrols by Japan .

"(CNN) -- Cardinal John Onaiyekan of Abuja, Nigeria, was asked last week at the celebration of Black History Month in Toronto if he thought that the time was ripe for an African pope. His answer attracted much cheering from the crowd of over 500 Catholics of African descent. He said: ""The time for an African pope was ripe even in the time of the Apostolic Fathers in the first century of the church. ""I am not saying that I wish to be considered for the papacy, but the fact that the Gospel is to be preached to all peoples, languages, and races means that the highest leadership of the church should be open to anyone from any race, language and nation. I will not be surprised to see an African pope in my lifetime."" None of us who listened to him expected that a week later, the prospect of an African pope will be put to the test in the next conclave in March as a result of the sudden resignation of Pope Benedict XVI. For many Catholics, where a pope comes from may not be as important as who the pope is, but for most African Catholics the election of an African pope will be a wonderful sign that African Catholicism has come of age, and they hope that such a pope will address squarely the particular challenges facing Africans today and integrate African culture and socio-economic priorities into mainstream Catholicism. Within the last three decades there has been a shift in global Catholicism. The center of gravity in World Christianity has moved from the West to the global South. Watch video: Contender to be the first black pope? This is not only with regard to African Catholicism but to African Christianity in general. British Missiologist Andrew Walls argues: ""African Christianity must be seen as a major component of contemporary representative Christianity, the standard Christianity of the present age, a demonstration model of its character. That is, we need to look at Africa today, in order to understand Christianity itself."" This is a view shared by many who watch the exponential growth and diversity of African Christianity at a time when Catholicism is dying in the heartland of Europe, weakened by sexual abuse, a crisis of leadership, and a crisis of faith and secularism. According to recent figures, 70% of Catholics now live in either in the Americas (48%) or in Europe (24%) and more than a quarter live either in the Asia-Pacific region (12%) or in Sub-Saharan Africa (16%). For the first time in history, Latin America and Africa provide more than half of the population of Catholics in the world today. At a time when the pews and churches of Europe and North America are empty and many dioceses are declaring bankruptcy, the churches in Africa are filled beyond capacity every Sunday. At a time when European church celebrations are seen to be too formal, too medieval and ritualistic, and lacking in joy and flavor, church celebrations in Africa are very enthusiastic, celebratory, communal and joyful. There is always something new and surprising in many African churches on Sunday, reflecting the unpredictable innovation and openness of African religious beliefs and practices to the dynamist of the Holy Spirit. As one White Canadian who attended our African Mass in Toronto told me recently: African Catholicism rocks! Whereas there is a frightening drop in vocations to the priesthood and religious life in North America and Europe, religious vocations are booming in Africa and African clerics are all over the Western world helping in the re-evangelization of the descendants of the Western missionaries who brought Christianity to Africa. Read more: World reacts to Pope's resignation . Catholicism is also a strong cultural influence in Africa's continuing search for answers to the challenges of poverty, diseases, ethnic and religious conflicts, wars, political and economic problems, radical Islamic fundamentalism, and how to mitigate the effects of climate change and natural disasters. Churches in Africa are becoming strong social capitals whose values lie not simply in providing spiritual support, but also in strengthening the civil society, creating healthy networks among people and valorizing the agency of Africans to safeguard basic human security for integral and sustainable development. Pope Benedict XVI also recognizes this shift. In November 2011, Pope Benedict XVI was in Contonou, Benin, to unveil the post-Apostolic Exhortation, Africae Munus, which contained the road map of the Second African Synod for the future of African Christianity. Among other things, Pope Benedict argued that Africa has become the spiritual lungs which will awaken the sleeping churches of the West, and that Africa should also become the center for the renewal of Catholic thought, philosophy and theology. Pope Benedict thus sees African Catholicism and African Catholics as well placed to lead Christianity to the future. The election of an African pope will no doubt vindicate Africa's place as the new center of Catholicism and world Christianity. The fundamental questions are: Is the Catholic church ready for a black pope? Will the church, which defines herself as universal, live up to the full consequences of her identity and give room to a new reality that could help reconnect the church to the movement of history which it seems to have abandoned under the papacy of Pope Benedict? Will the Catholic Church accept Africa's brand of Catholicism and will an African pope be more Roman than African? Is an African pope better placed to address the challenges facing Africa today as well as give new energy and renewal to a tired church in the West? However, whoever becomes the next pope -- African or non-African -- should see himself as a pope for the world. He should not become a prisoner of the Vatican or to a eurocentric medieval notion of Roman Catholicism or orthodoxy. Furthermore, he should not become a slave to some of the time-worn structures and teachings of the Catholic Church. On the contrary, he should go out to the ends of the earth and reach out to all people, especially those disenchanted and marginal Catholics -- women divorced and separated Catholics, gays and lesbians, victims of clerical sexual abuse, and those who feel alienated from the church because of some of its sterner moral and spiritual prescriptions. The boundaries of ethical and doctrinal discourse are shifting in a radical way. It should be the task of the new pope to help make the Catholic Church a community of faith of people of many colors; a church that embraces social change and cultures as a friend, and endorses through her laws and practices the dignity of differences. This way, the Catholic Church will become truly a household of God, where blacks and whites, saints and sinners, men and women, liberals and conservatives, rich and poor, gays and straights are all treated as equal children of God, without regard to rank or status.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man who was accused of faking his death last summer pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge Thursday, Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice announced. Raymond Roth, 48, of Massapequa, New York, was first reported missing in the waters off Jones Beach late last July by his 22-year-old son, Jonathan Roth. Several days into an extensive search involving multiple agencies, New York State Park Police said, authorities learned the missing man was in South Carolina, where he had been pulled over for speeding. The day before Raymond Roth was pulled over, his wife, Evana, showed authorities e-mails she had discovered that appeared to detail a plan between him and his son to fake his death. Raymond Roth wanted his wife and son to collect at least $410,000 in life insurance benefits while he started a new life in Florida, Rice said. State police arrested both men in early August on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy and filing a false report. Raymond Roth on Thursday agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for a sentence of 90 days in jail and five years' probation, the district attorney's office said. He also must pay restitution for the cost of the search -- $27,445 to the U.S. Coast Guard and $9,109 to the Nassau County Police Department. Evana Roth told CNN in August she thought her husband devised the plan after he was fired from his job in July. Her attorney, Lenard Leeds, said she had been unaware of the ruse before she uncovered the e-mail correspondence. ""There needs to be a way for me to find out how things are going. Call me Sunday night at 8 PM at the resort,"" Raymond Roth wrote in an e-mail to his son the day before the son reported him missing. The son's case is still pending, the district attorney said. Jonathan Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, defended his client after his arrest, saying, ""There was abuse here, manipulation here, coercion here"" from the father. Raymond Roth's attorney, Brian Davis, denied in August that Roth had involved his son in the scheme. ""We had issues concerning the facts people had whether (Roth) had an agreement with his son,"" Davis told CNN on Thursday. ""He's admitted it now. He's accepted responsibility."" Davis added that his client has been under treatment for bipolar disorder in recent weeks. During plea negotiations, Raymond Roth asked the district attorney's office not to give his son jail time, Davis said. On the advice of both their attorneys, father and son have not been in contact since their arrests, Davis said.

"Washington (CNN) -- A top Republican senator used the terror bombings in Boston to raise new questions on Friday about a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill, legislation that now faces growing questions from conservative critics. Immigration reformers seek to avoid deja vu . Democrats shouldn't rush the legislative process ""given the events of this week,"" Iowa's Chuck Grassley said at the opening of a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the nearly 900-page bill. ""It's important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system,"" Grassley said. ""How can individuals evade authorities and plan such attacks on our soil? How can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the U.S.?"" ""This hearing is an opportunity to refocus on ... the importance of remaining vigilant and secure in our homeland,"" he added. One of the bill's authors, New York Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer, responded by urging fellow senators to ""allow the actual facts to come out"" before ""jumping to conclusions about Boston."" Two other leading Senate Republicans asserted in a written statement released after the hearing that the Boston bombings actually highlighted the necessity for immigration reform. ""Immigration reform will strengthen our nation's security by helping us identify exactly who has entered our country and who has left -- a basic function of government that our broken immigration system is incapable of accomplishing today,"" said South Carolina's Lindsey Graham and Arizona's John McCain. ""We have 11 million people living in the shadows, which leaves this nation vulnerable to a myriad of threats,"" they added. ""By modernizing our system of legal immigration, identifying and conducting background checks on people here illegally, and finally securing our border, we will make America more secure."" Overall, the issues of border security and economic concerns dominated the first committee hearing on the long-awaited plan, which was unveiled against the backdrop of the deadly Boston Marathon bombings and subsequent manhunt. ""Gang of 8"" confident immigration bill can break Senate gridlock . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano was scheduled to testify, but canceled her appearance on Friday morning as the Boston-area manhunt intensified. ""There is a great deal going on in Massachusetts,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the panel's chairman. ""I hope everybody will understand why the Secretary Napolitano will not be here."" Bombing manhunt: Where is the suspect hiding? Leahy promised she would testify on the bill at a later date. Tighter security has long been a key immigration reform demand for many conservatives, who argue that current border controls remain insufficient. Rubio's rapid response to immigration reform critics . The two prime suspects in Monday's bombings came to the United States in 2002 and 2006, according to a federal official. Both suspects were in the country legally. One of them became a U.S. citizen last year, an official told CNN. The bill assembled by the Senate's ""Gang of Eight"" -- comprised of four Democrats and four Republicans -- would, among other things, commit $3 billion to enhanced border security. Money would be used to fortify border fences, boost patrols, and acquire surveillance technology from the Department of Defense -- including drones and drone pilots. The legislation would require constant surveillance of high-risk border areas and require that border officers turn back at least 90% of those who attempt illegal crossings each year. Vulnerable sections of the border would have to be deemed secure before most of America's roughly 11 million undocumented residents could begin the journey to citizenship. Read the immigration reform bill . Some conservatives are skeptical the Obama administration will ever secure the border to their satisfaction. Many reform advocates believe conservatives want to use the border security issue to deny citizenship to undocumented residents. It's not right to put undocumented residents at the ""mercy"" of a border security requirement, Leahy argued. And ""spending billions more"" on border controls, like fences, are not the ""best use of taxpayer dollars."" But the bill is a ""product of compromise"" and ""difficult concessions"" on all sides, he added. Testimony from the hearing's two remaining witnesses focused on the economic impact of immigration reform, and whether it would damage job and wage prospects for citizens on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. ""We have an abundant supply of low skilled labor waiting for jobs,"" argued Peter Kirsanow, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Sweeping legalization of undocumented workers will result in the ""leapfrogging (of) those individuals."" And ""we're living in a fantasy land"" if we think ""by a stroke of a pen"" the economic prospects of undocumented residents will be significantly improved, he added. Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions agreed, arguing that America has ""more low skilled labor than we can find jobs for today."" ""I think this (fact was) not considered properly in this bill,"" said Sessions, who declared that the legislation was written by ""big business"" and ""big agricultural interests."" But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a leading GOP voice on economic issues and former head of the Congressional Budget Office, insisted that illegal immigration isn't the main problem for the country's low skill workers. American workers with few skills are being forced to compete globally, he told the panel. ""Geographic location has very little to do with it."" Legalizing undocumented workers will help ""eliminate the capacity for exploitation,"" he added. Under the bill, most undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States before December 31, 2011, would be eligible for legal residency and ultimately citizenship. They cannot, however, have any felony convictions in U.S. or foreign courts. Smaller offenses can also block residency. The bill would block applicants with more than three misdemeanor convictions, including for offenses such as reckless driving, trespassing or vandalism. The bill would also require undocumented immigrants to pay a penalty of up to $500 for having come to the United States illegally, and also pay any back taxes before receiving temporary approval to stay. After 10 years as provisional residents, immigrants could become lawful permanent residents by following the same guidelines as immigrants who enter the country legally. That process includes a $1,000 fee. The Judiciary Committee is set to hold another hearing on the bill on Monday. Full Senate consideration would likely occur in June, according to multiple sources. A bipartisan group of legislators in the House of Representatives is crafting its own immigration reform proposal.","NEW: Sens.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- An Idaho man accused of slapping a crying 19-month-old boy on a Delta flight pleaded not guilty in federal court Wednesday in Atlanta. Joe Rickey Hundley is charged with assaulting a minor in connection with the incident last month. Accompanied by his attorney outside the courthouse, Hundley appeared solemn and looked toward the ground. Before Hundley's court appearance, his attorney, Marcia Shein, said that he would be entering a plea of not guilty. Man accused of slapping crying boy on Delta flight is out of a job . After the hearing, Shein issued a statement on Hundley's behalf, saying that the day before the flight on February 8, her client had learned that his son had overdosed on insulin and was in a coma on life support. ""Mr. Hundley had been up for 24 hours over this tragic news and was heading to Atlanta to decide, with his son's mother, if they should take him off life support as he had no brain activity. On the flight he was in distress, upset and grieving,"" Shein said. His son died the next day, she said. According to court documents, the boy's mother, Jessica Bennett, and her son were seated in Row 28, Seat B on Delta Flight 721, which originated in Minneapolis. She spent part of the flight in the rear of the plane to get away from Hundley, who she said smelled like alcohol and was slurring his speech, according to John Thompson, attorney for the child's family. In her statement Wednesday, Shein did not address whether Hundley was drunk. As the plane began its descent into Atlanta, the boy began to cry because of the altitude change, and his mother tried to soothe him.

"(CNN) -- Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard has survived another attempt to oust her from the job after no challengers emerged to vie for the leadership of the governing party and the country. In a short statement after the vote, Gillard said she accepted the support of her colleagues ""with a sense of deep humility and a sense of resolve."" She said that leadership uncertainty that had been blighting the party in recent months was settled ""in the most conclusive fashion possible."" One hundred Labor caucus members had been due to vote, but in the end, no votes were cast because there were no candidates beyond Gillard for prime minister, and Wayne Swan as her deputy. ""There was no vote because there were no opposing candidates,"" said ALP returning officer Chris Hayes. ""It puts beyond doubt the question of leadership in the Australian Labor Party,"" he added. Minutes before the meeting of Australian Labor Party (ALP) caucus members, former leader Kevin Rudd made it clear that he would not be pitting himself against his former rival. ""I'm not prepared to dishonor my word,"" he told reporters. He was referring to comments he made last February after mounting an unsuccessful bid to depose Gillard. At the time he said he wouldn't try again. Rudd lost that poll 31 to Gillard's 71, but the decisive vote failed to end speculation about a leadership challenge amid a poor performance by the prime minister in public polls. Gillard called the vote for 4:30 p.m. local time (1:30 a.m. ET) after being pushed by long-time Labor minister Simon Crean. Crean called a press conference and dramatically challenged Rudd to stand up and bring an end to bitter infighting. ""I don't want any more games, I'm sick to death of it, it's about time he stood up and instead of having his camp leak things, actually have the courage of his conviction and his beliefs,"" Crean said. Before the vote, Crean said he wouldn't be nominating himself as leader, but would take the job of deputy. Until Thursday, he was Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, and Minister for the Arts. An uneasy tension has existed between Rudd and Gillard since his former deputy staged a successful bid to replace him in June 2010. Soon after, she assigned him to the post of foreign minister. Gillard reinforced her claim to power by winning a general election in August 2010. However the vote produced the first hung parliament in Australia since 1940. The Welsh-born politician secured enough support from the Australian Greens Party, and independents, to form a minority government. However last month, the Greens pulled their support, with leader Christine Milne accusing the Gillard government of ''walking away from its agreement with the Greens and into the arms of the big miners.'' The parties clashed over a number of issues, not least a controversial mining tax and a move by the government to reject World Heritage Listing for the Tarkine wilderness in north west Tasmania. In January, Gillard surprised the country by calling an election for September 14, the longest lead time for an Australian election in history. At the time, experts warned the tactic could backfire.","NEW: Gillard says leadership issue settled conclusively .

"(CNN) -- The United States is condemning the destruction of two more tombs in northern Mali as international outrage grows over Islamist militants' attacks on historic and religious landmarks in the nation. Islamists ordered residents to leave the area and started razing the tombs in Timbuktu this week, witnesses said. ""They were shooting in the air to warn people of going near and entering the area,"" local resident Allimam Oumar said of the Tuesday attacks. ""The militants think the shrines are idolatrous."" The tombs -- a common feature on Timbuktu postcards -- are the latest in attacks on landmarks listed as U.N. World Heritage sites. Opinion: Timbuktu tomb attack is an attack on our humanity . Islamic militants have gone on a rampage for months, destroying sacred tombs in the city and vowing to target more. In May, elderly men kept watch over the main library after Islamists burned a different tomb in another attack in Timbuktu. ""We are outraged by the continued destruction of these World Heritage sites and the ongoing intimidation of local populations,"" said Victoria Nuland, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department . ""We ... call for all parties to protect this invaluable cultural heritage for future generations. This is an assault not just on Mali but on the heritage of all Africans."" Chaos have rocked Mali since a military ruler overthrew the democratically-elected president in March, shaking one of West Africa's most stable democracies. The coup leader stepped down in May and transferred power to a civilian transitional government, but uncertainty looms. Ethnic Tuareg rebels and other Islamist militants have taken advantage of the uncertainty to seize control of the northern portion of the country, including Timbuktu. Ansar Dine, an al Qaeda-linked group claiming control of the city, is blamed for the attacks on historical landmarks. The picturesque city of Timbuktu is considered an important destination for Islamic scholars, and features ancient and prominent burial sites. Islamist militants regard such shrines as idolatrous and thus prohibited in their religion. They especially target Sufi shrines, which they believe are sacrilegious. Sufism is a mystical dimension of Islam considered offbeat and frowned upon by Islamic hardliners. The Sufis, who brought Islam to much of sub-Saharan Africa, dance, pray and preach using drama and humor. In a similar attack in 2001, the Taliban destroyed ancient Buddhist relics in Afghanistan. Mali separatists ready to act over destruction of tombs . Experts say the mud and wooden structures dating to the 15th century are at the heart of Timbuktu's culture. ""Timbuktu is no ordinary town. The fabled ""City of 333 Saints"" is an ancient desert crossroads and a historic seat of Islamic learning and faith,"" said Irina Bokova, who heads the U.N. cultural body, UNESCO. Attacks on such landmarks translates to the loss of history and the values associated with such sites, according to Bokova. ""It is an attack against the physical evidence that peace and dialogue is possible. This is condemned uniformly by religious leaders across the world,"" she said. Last week, the United Nations called for sanctions against the Islamist fighters and warned it is considering a proposal by West Africa states to deploy troops in the troubled country. It also urged U.N. member states to submit names of those with ties to al Qaeda in northern Mali. West African leaders proposed plans to deploy troops from member states to Mali, but the Security Council said it needs more details before it can make a decision on the request. The transitional government has said it is working toward restoring stability in the north.

"(CNN) -- Italy has moved to defuse a diplomatic dispute with India by agreeing to send back two Italian marines accused of killing two Indian fishermen last year. The two Italian marines are due to face trial in India over the allegations, but after the Indian Supreme Court allowed them to return to Italy last month to vote in national elections, Rome refused to send them back. That decision angered Indian government officials and Supreme Court justices, who noted that the Italian ambassador had given assurances to the court that the marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, would come back to India after the elections. The court responded last week by temporarily banning the ambassador, Daniele Mancini, from leaving India, a move that Italy said violated the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The two sides appeared locked in an impasse, with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh saying Italy's actions were ""not acceptable"" and warning of ""consequences"" for the two countries' relations. On Thursday, the Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti's office said it would make good on the commitment to send the sailors back after receiving written assurances from the Indian government that the two men's ""fundamental rights"" would be protected. The two sailors have agreed to the decision, it said. The Indian government appeared to welcome the move, with Home Affairs Minister R.P.N. Singh saying on Twitter that New Delhi's ""tough stand"" had worked. Italy has argued that the February 2012 shooting involving its marines happened in international waters and was therefore outside of Indian jurisdiction. Latorre and Girone say they mistook the fishermen for pirates. CNN's Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.","Rome says it received assurances that the marines' rights will be protected .

"Washington (CNN) -- Capitol Hill lawmakers finally brought the 2013 budget fight to an end Thursday by approving a bill that ended the threat of a government shutdown -- minutes before ratcheting up the partisan warfare over taxes and spending in 2014. Members of the House voted 318-109 to send President Barack Obama a bill funding the government through the end of the current fiscal year in September while easing the pain of $85 billion in forced spending cuts disliked by leaders on both sides of the aisle. The measure extending current federal funding authority was needed to avoid a partial shutdown of the government on March 27. Both houses of Congress are scheduled to be on break over the next two weeks for the Easter and Passover holidays. Don't expect much of a breather, however, in the bitter budget battles that have become one of the hallmarks of a sharply polarized, borderline dysfunctional national legislature. The GOP-controlled House also passed a fiscal year 2014 budget Thursday that is guaranteed to go nowhere in the Democratic-run Senate. Opinion: Ryan budget is a firing offense . The Republican plan, crafted by recent Mitt Romney running mate Rep. Paul Ryan, cuts taxes while balancing the budget over 10 years by slashing spending by $4.6 trillion, repealing Obama's health care law and making major changes to Medicare. No House Democrats voted for it. The Senate voted Thursday on the Ryan budget in what appeared to be a political move to show it could not pass. It failed, with 59 senators voting against it and 40 voting in favor. Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, called the Ryan budget a ""bold plan"" and a statement of party principles. Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a member of the Democratic leadership, called it an ""uncompromising ideological approach"" that would replicate disastrous European austerity policies. New air traffic control towers among those on chopping block . Not to be outdone, the Democratic-controlled Senate continued its work Thursday on a 2014 budget that cuts the deficit in part by hiking taxes on the wealthy and corporations by $975 billion over the next decade. Republicans note taxes already went up at the start of 2013 as part of the fiscal cliff deal. GOP leaders insist they won't raise the overall tax burden another dime. Democrats are ""serving the needs of government instead of the needs of those who elected them,"" declared Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. General: Cuts could hurt anti-drug efforts . As for the rest of the current fiscal year, the measure now set to become law reduces the impact of the $85 billion in forced cuts -- called sequestration -- by establishing stop-gap budgets for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, and Veterans Affairs, among other things. By crafting new budgets for targeted departments and programs, the package resets priorities and helps better manage the draconian formula of the spending cuts. Crafted primarily by Maryland Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski and Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, the measure largely spares a number of politically sensitive programs from the budget ax, including meat inspection and infant nutrition. Overall, the legislation locks in $984 billion in non-entitlement program spending -- a notable drop from the $1.043 trillion initially approved before the forced sequestration cuts took effect. Despite the bill's bipartisan nature, many members on both sides of the aisle remain unhappy with the outcome. Food inspectors rescued . Conservatives argue the package is still loaded with pork barrel spending. Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, for example, questioned the inclusion of $65 million for Pacific coast salmon restoration. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, complained Wednesday about being denied a vote on an amendment to protect rural airport control towers from closure due to the cuts. He accused opponents of stripping critical funds simply to score political points and frame the debate in a way that favors defenders of a larger government. It's ""the only explanation I ever get that has any semblance of truth,"" Moran said on the Senate floor. ""By denying the amendment's passage, we prove that sequestration can't work, that we can't cut money from budgets."" More liberal members of Congress blasted the cuts, but said the deal was the only way to avoid a partial government shutdown. The cuts are ""reckless,"" said Rep. Nita Lowey of New York, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. But ""a government shutdown could wreak havoc on our already fragile economic recovery and must be prevented."" ""Whatever our disagreement on some of these bills, it was worse to shut down government,"" added House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California.

"(CNN) -- The recent financial troubles in Cyprus have attracted a range of alarming headlines around the world, but we must be careful to avoid panic and reckless measures that would exacerbate the crisis. For in reality, Cyprus -- one of the smallest economies in the eurozone -- has a manageable fiscal deficit, low debt and until very recently a thriving economy, based on financial services and tourism. Large reserves of natural gas and possibly oil have been discovered off its southern coast, which would bring a bonanza in three to five years. Read more: Why is Cyprus trying to tax bank deposits? The roots of the crisis go back to 2006 when the Cyprus Popular Bank, the country's second biggest bank was taken over by a smaller Greek bank. The new owners invested very heavily in Greek bonds and loans but kept it as a Cypriot bank, instead of transferring the HQ to Greece. This was because of the better corporate environment in Cyprus, where tax rates are just 10%, compared to Greece where it is at least double that. Three years ago the Bank of Cyprus also bought large quantities of Greek bonds, largely for reasons unconnected with their rate of return or risk, to help out Greece. In 2011, when a struggling Greece was allowed to let some of its private bond holders take a loss -- a ""haircut"" -- Cypriot banks lost money and needed refinancing. So the big financial institutions like the Bank of Cyprus and Popular Bank asked for a bailout from the government, and the government came to the EU in June 2012 saying it needed a bailout in turn. Read more: UK flies cash to Cyprus for soldiers . Last weekend under an EU plan, Cyprus agreed to raise â‚¬5.8 billion to prevent debt from ballooning to unsustainable levels. This would have seen a bank levy on all deposits over 100,000 euros in banks in Cyprus and a smaller percentage on deposits of more than 20,000 euros. The measure sparked fury in the Cypriot parliament, prompting Cypriots to withdraw money from bank cash machines and raising fears of a broader run on ailing banks. Russia, which has extensive business and banking ties to the tiny island, was angered by the move. Read more: Cyprus deposit tax 'overnight robbery,' says businessman . Prudent bankers attracted depositors by following low-risk strategies. But now their depositors are asked to pay for the high-risk strategies of other bankers. High-risk bankers risked their depositors' money. But their depositors will not lose more than the depositors of other banks. This is the logic of the Cyprus ""bailout"" by the International Monetary Fund, the German-led Euro group and the European Central Bank. Delinquent bankers' losses are protected by prudent bankers' gains. Watch this: Cyprus MP: Bailout plan won't work . What is the justification? It's better than letting the two risk takers go bankrupt, the argument goes. That probably is the case. But then Greek banks and those of other nations in trouble were also bankrupt, and yet the same troika lend to them on better terms in order to avoid bankruptcy. Greece got 140 billion euros; the haircut on Cypriot depositors will yield 5.8 billion. But Cyprus could not have the 5.8 billion out of European funds set up to rescue banks in trouble. Deposits under 100,000 euros are insured in Europe. Yet, the terms of the euro group are so harsh, that the government of Cyprus could not raise the money without some haircut on the insured deposits. It is important to note that on Tuesday the Cypriot parliament rejected a â‚¬10 billion eurozone bailout package due to investor alarm over the proposed tax on existing bank deposits. However we don't know what will come next. Maybe the tax on the insured deposits will yield 2 billion euros. Agreed said the euro group: we'd prefer not to tax deposits under 100,000 euros but if you cannot afford to raise the 5.8 billion in any other way, then you have no choice but to tax the small depositors. What does this tell us about the European project though? Is the eurozone a partnership of equals who care about each other's subjects? Or is it a vehicle for scoring political points by the strong and powerful? Russia's involvement with Cyprus as an offshore centre keeps coming up in these discussions. Attracted by a corporate tax rate of 10% -- half that of Russia's -- Russians have been investing money into Cyprus from the early 1990s. The money is then repatriated through investments in Russian ventures -- a legal way of reducing tax. Cyprus accepted an order last month by the Eurogroup to allow an investigation into possible breaches of money-laundering rules, which is under way. But the euro group could not wait for the results before imposing the haircut; not a single case of money laundering has been discovered so far. I have been involved both with central bank policy and with private banking in Cyprus for years (and at different times) and I have never come across anything non-compliant with European rules. The Russians make Cyprus's financial sector too large, it is claimed. But it is still not as large as Luxembourg's, and not too different from those of other small nations with a highly educated labour force. And anyway, when a large system works well except for its involvement in a single and exceptional event like the Greek sovereign debt write-off, you don't cut off half the system and destroy the sector, causing acute unemployment problems. You try to fix it, with better regulation of risk and other vulnerabilities. But then they shoot the horses, don't they? Sooner or later such policies could backfire on Europe. Those of us who supported the European integration movement are disappointed.","Those of us who supported the EU integration movement are disappointed, writes Pissarides .

"(CNN) -- Doyin Oladipupo was on the phone with a police dispatcher, hiding in a closet when she heard the door open. Three intruders, who had set off the home security alarm, came into the walk-in closet in her parents' bedroom, apparently looking for items to steal from the Chula Vista, California, home. The 15-year-old was cowering in a corner next to some shelves. She thought her bright toe nail polish would give her away. ""I was so scared. I could see them,"" she told CNN affiliate KGTV. ""I thought they would see me."" The 911 operator heard one of the intruders hollering at the others and told the girl, who was home alone, not to talk. The dispatcher then asked her to tap once on the cordless handset to indicate she understood not to open the closet door. She remained silent and still, Oladipupo told KGTV, while the intruders came in and took jewelry off a shelf, she said. Police said in a statement that when officers arrived, the three intruders were loading items from the home into a car on the street. Two of the suspects are 17 years old, and the third is 18. The car had been stolen a week before the attempted burglary, which happened Tuesday afternoon. There were items from other burglaries in the car, police said. ""I don't know how I did it, honestly,"" Oladipupo said. ""Because when I think about it now, my heart just starts beating.""","Girl, 15, was alone when three people broke into her California home .

"(CNN) -- When Cesar Castillo's cancer returned for the second time, he fell apart. ""I had to go through a rigorous chemo and radiation therapy and a stem cell transplant,"" he said. ""I couldn't concentrate. I couldn't relax. I was really anxious and depressed. All I kept thinking was: 'Here I am, not even 30, being poisoned and fighting for my life.'"" Diagnosed with severe depression, Castillo was put on Paxil. ""The medicine turned me into a totally different (person),"" he remembers, ""and yet I still couldn't relax."" Are we over-diagnosing mental illness? A year later, with the help of a yoga class for cancer survivors at his gym, Castillo was feeling like his old self again. By then he had given up on the medication. So, when a work crisis triggered a second bout of depression and panic attacks, he had no intention of trying meds again. ""I went back to what had worked for me the first time. I upped the Bikram yoga and I channeled my energy into getting stronger and more relaxed again,"" he said. ""Yoga became my saving grace."" Castillo's success with yoga would not surprise Dr. P. Murali Doraiswamy, professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke University Medical Center. Doraiswamy is one of three authors of a recent study published in the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry. ""We all know the myth of yoga,"" says Doraiswamy. But he and his colleagues wanted to know whether there was evidence to match the hype. To find out, they sifted through more than 100 studies on the effects of yoga on a variety of major psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia and ADHD. After narrowing their field to only the highest-quality studies, the Duke researchers focused on 16 and found that yoga holds tangible benefits for disorders ranging from sleep complaints and ADHD to schizophrenia and depression. Evidence for yoga's effect on eating disorders and cognition problems was either conflicting or lacking. Scientists have cited evidence that the practice of yoga may affect the human body in ways similar to antidepressants and psychotherapy. One study of biomarkers, for example, found that yoga influences brain chemicals by boosting serotonin levels, lowers inflammation, reduces oxidative stress and exerts a positive influence on other key elements of the human body that play a role in mental health. So is it time to exchange your medications for a yoga mat? Absolutely not, says Doraiswamy, but he says rigorous research of this issue on a larger scale should be a national priority. There are some 30 to 50 million Americans taking psychiatric drugs, he notes. Some are benefiting and some are not. In one study, funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, only one-third of patients achieved remission of depressive symptoms, defined as becoming symptom-free. As a culture, we are becoming more and more dependent on pills, Doraiswamy tells me, but pills don't prevent any of the psychiatric illnesses. They don't build resilience. They don't teach coping strategies and they don't in general engender wellness. There are some situations when medication is essential. But outside-the-box strategies, such as yoga, could offer a low-cost, viable approach. The issue echoes a sentiment I have been hearing about with increasing frequency: Recent advances in fields such as nutrition, technology and the mind-body connection are continuing to expand our definition of what constitutes mainstream ""medicine."" Drugs and surgery, yes; but what else? Researchers, for example, recently showed for the first time that a Mediterranean diet can have as powerful an effect as drugs in preventing heart attacks, strokes and deaths from cardiovascular disease in subjects at high risk of heart disease. Other scientists are contemplating the possibility of having doctors ask their patients to download an app in lieu of taking a drug and calling them in the morning. Alas, as tangible and compelling as the effects of these nondrug interventions may be, they often lack the deep pharma pockets required for the clinical trials that will bring doctors on board. When it comes to yoga, at least, Doraiswamy believes we should be urging our government agencies or large nonprofit agencies to take on the issue and to help establish rigorous proof for the benefit of the public. I try to imagine how I would feel if a psychiatrist were to prescribe me a downward dog or two instead of an antidepressant. Odd, I think. But in a really good way.","Study finds yoga holds tangible benefits for a range of disorders .

"(CNN) -- In the biggest crackdown on police corruption in the FBI's 102-year history, authorities charged a total of 133 individuals in Puerto Rico Wednesday as the result of a probe into whether police provided protection for drug dealers. All but four people, who were still being sought, were arrested Wednesday, authorities said. In all, 89 law enforcement officers and 44 other people were indicted as part of a two-year undercover investigation into 125 drug transactions. The scope of Operation Guard Shack was also described as unprecedented because 750 FBI personnel were flown to the island to carry out the raids and make arrests, Attorney General Eric Holder said. In total, he said, more than 1,000 FBI personnel participated. The investigation began when an undercover FBI agent posed as a dealer selling multiple kilograms of cocaine and ""put the word out that he needed security during drug deals,"" the FBI said on its website. ""Many of those who responded were cops. They actively took part in the transactions by carrying weapons and patting down the drug buyers -- who were actually FBI informants."" The cops were paid between $500 and $4,500 for their efforts, the FBI said. ""In all, more than $500,000 was paid in protection money."" Puerto Rico is a major shipping point for drugs between the East Coast and such South American countries as Colombia and Peru, said Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, the U.S. attorney for Puerto Rico. She described the corruption as limited to a relatively small number of officers ""who wanted to make a fast buck ... and needed the money."" ""The people of Puerto Rico deserve better,"" Holder said. He told Puerto Ricans that ""as you continue your fight against drug trafficking, violent crime and corruption, we will continue to stand with you."" The 133 defendants have been charged in 26 indictments with charges that include conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 5 kilograms of cocaine, attempt to possess with intent to distribute more than 5 kilograms of cocaine, and use of a firearm during the commission of a drug trafficking offense. A grand jury in Puerto Rico returned the indictments last month, and they were unsealed Wednesday, officials said. Arrested were 60 members of the Puerto Rico Police Department, 16 members of various local police departments, 12 correctional officers, eight former law officers, three National Guard soldiers, two U.S. Army officers, one administrative examiner in child support matters, one Social Security Administration employee and 30 other civilians. The operations began at 3 a.m. ET Wednesday, the FBI said, when 65 tactical teams fanned out across the island, the FBI said. FBI personnel on hand included crisis negotiators, evidence response team members, police dogs and their handlers and 80 medical personnel, including a trauma surgeon and a veterinarian. They traveled in armored Humvees, helicopters and some 250 rental cars, the FBI said. Some Puerto Rican police officers assisted in the investigation into alleged law enforcement corruption, said Rodriguez-Velez. ""They refused to tolerate the corruption they witnessed,"" she said. Puerto Rico Police Department Chief Figueroa Sancha knew of the investigation, the FBI said, quoting him as saying, ""All the officers arrested during today's takedown did not honor or value the significance of working for the Puerto Rico Police Department."" Not all of the law enforcement officers arrested knew each other, according to Rodriguez-Velez, and they came from different parts of the island. A police lieutenant was involved in recruiting others to provide protection for the drug dealers, she said. ""Badges were sold and honor was compromised for drug money,"" she added. ""Public corruption does not just strike at the heart of good government. It also jeopardizes the security of our communities and our nation,"" Shawn Henry, FBI executive assistant director, said in a statement. If convicted, the defendants face sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment, according to the Justice Department. ""This is a fight that cannot be won without the assistance of our community,"" said Rodriguez-Velez. ""Today, I call upon the citizens of the community not to remain silent.""

"(CNN) -- Casey Hayden knows something about hate. She's seen how hateful words can cause people to demonize their political foes, grab guns and commit murder. She's a survivor of one of the most brutal episodes of the civil rights movement. Long before the January 8 shootings in Tucson, Arizona, sparked debate about the role of heated rhetoric, Hayden and other civil rights veterans worried about the nation's recent political tone -- and what it might wreak. Hayden is a former volunteer with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. She was working in an office one summer day in 1964 when she received a call that three civil rights workers were missing. The bodies of the murdered men were discovered after a 44-day search. ""I knew immediately that they were dead,"" Hayden said. ""You don't forget things like that. Things like that happen when political emotions are heated."" There appears to be no direct evidence that politics motivated Jared Lee Loughner, the man accused of killing six people and wounding 13 -- including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Internet postings attributed to Loughner show what one expert called ""classic signs of psychosis."" Source: Provocative Loughner photo turns up . Still, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called on colleagues to tone down the militant-themed messages and fear-laced speeches that have marked recent dialogue in Washington and on the campaign trail. For some civil rights veterans, the debate over political rhetoric isn't academic -- it's personal. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, said the recent political tone ""takes me back to that period in the civil rights movement when we were called un-American."" Lewis, who was beaten in Selma, Alabama, while leading a civil rights march, said rhetoric turns dangerous when groups go beyond the war analogies common in political speech and imply their foes are enemies of America. During the health care reform debate, some leaders called their foes ""un-American"" and ""socialists,"" he says. ""Individuals like Gov. George Wallace or Bull Connor never threw a bomb or pulled a trigger, but they created the climate for others to throw the bomb and pull the trigger,"" Lewis said, referring to the segregationist Alabama leader and Birmingham city commissioner. Both the recent rhetoric and the Tucson shooting reawakened memories for Lewis, Hayden and others from the civil rights era. Hayden said that when she retired to Tucson, she never expected to experience the dread she once felt as a civil rights worker in Mississippi. But in recent months, she said she had felt a familiar sense of foreboding. She said she saw hundreds of Tea Party members shout down Giffords at a town hall meeting. She saw scores of ordinary Arizonans openly carry guns around town. She noted the rising ethnic strife. ""I told people, this is the new Mississippi,"" Hayden said. ""This is where the focus of the resurgence of right-wing hostility is located."" Pima County, Arizona, Sheriff Clarence Dupnik set off a wave of criticism after the shootings when he made similar comments calling Arizona a ""mecca for prejudice and bigotry"" and blaming the news media for spreading ""vitriolic rhetoric."" A conservative talk show host and a local newspaper were among those who accused the sheriff of becoming part of the problem. The Pima County Tea Party Patriots put out a statement calling on ""all Americans to come together and renounce violence."" ""There is no place in America's political debate for acts of violence,"" the statement said. ""While we disagree with Congresswoman Giffords on many things, we pray for her survival and full recovery without reservation or exception."" Giffords upgraded to serious condition . Hank Thomas knows what it's like to enter a state that's considered a mecca of bigotry. Thomas is a former ""Freedom Rider,"" part of an interracial group of students who tried to desegregate interstate bus travel in 1961 by riding Greyhound buses throughout the South. They were savagely beaten by mobs and, in one infamous incident in Anniston, Alabama, their bus was torched. Thomas said Southern political leaders helped create mobs by demonizing Freedom Riders in the press and describing their arrival as an ""invasion."" ""Words have consequences,"" said Thomas, who will mark the 50th anniversary of the Freedom Rides this year with his friends. ""The governor of Alabama called us outside agitators, communists and race mixers. He said the good people of Alabama would not protect us."" Thomas said political tension has been building since the country elected Barack Obama as its first African-American president. Calling Obama a socialist and a native of Kenya and labeling health care reform ""Obamacare"" can condition some people to see the president and others as part of a new wave of invaders who must be stopped, with violence if necessary, Thomas said. Thomas said he and other civil rights veterans have been discussing the dangers for some time. ""In the private conversations in our home, we shuddered at what these kinds of things were leading to,"" said Thomas, who lives in Stone Mountain, Georgia, just outside Atlanta. Thomas said many of the whites he encountered in the South during the civil rights movement were angry because they felt integration would cause them to lose their status. He said he believes some whites feel the same anxiety today. Susan Glisson, director of the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation at the University of Mississippi, said contemporary politicians should heed the lessons of history by avoiding language that demonizes their foes. If a political leader assassinates a foe's character, a troubled person might think it's OK to assassinate the foe, she said. But some contemporary politicians forget this lesson from the civil rights era, she said. ""There's an historical amnesia because they're so focused on winning political battles at any cost,"" Glisson said. Political leaders serving in times of great anxiety face a choice, she said: ""The purpose of leadership is not to speak to fears, but to speak to people's hopes."" Others argue that political rhetoric has its place in the national debate. Jonathan Chait of the New Republic magazine said the left has deployed the same war-like political rhetoric that it now condemns, noting that President Obama once said during his 2008 presidential campaign, ""If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun."" ""Strong feelings are a part of political discourse,"" Chait wrote. ""This is serious business. Important things are at stake, including, at times, life and death. People have a right to be angry."" Michael Barone, a political analyst for the Washington Examiner newspaper, said right-wing politics had nothing to do with the Tucson shootings. ""It has become obvious that the murderer was crazy, the follower of no political movement, motivated only by the bizarre ideas ricocheting around his head,"" Barone wrote. Opinion: After Tucson, will media tone it down? Yet sometimes political leaders can make public statements that make them sound unhinged, said one civil rights veteran. Bruce Hartford, who was a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, recalled some of the rhetoric of Southern politicians when he participated in a civil rights campaign in Selma with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1965. ""The politicians were creating a climate of fear and hysteria to get votes,"" Hartford said. ""They were going around saying that Northern blacks had been assigned to rape white women."" Hartford said it's virtually inevitable that rapid social changes in America -- electing the first black president, the influx of Latino immigrants -- will be accompanied by violence. ""There is almost always an undercurrent of violence in this country that emerges as a reaction to the advancement of a despised minority's rights,"" Hartford said. That violence doesn't have to occur, though, if enough leaders create safe public spaces for varying groups of people to talk to one another, said Glisson. Glisson points to Mississippi as an example. She says the once notorious state has more black elected officials than any other. Civil rights history is taught in its schools, and interracial groups gather to talk about racial progress, she says. ""If it can happen in Mississippi, it can happen anywhere,"" she said. She said it happens when Americans heed the wisdom of an old adage that declares: . ""My enemy is someone whose story I haven't heard.""","Recent rhetoric, Tucson shooting reawakened memories for civil rights veterans .

"(CNN) -- Maybe it pays to be a complainer. Several DirecTV customers are reporting on online forums that they were able to get up to $10 per month knocked off their bills because they threatened to leave the satellite TV company over the fact that Viacom programming is no longer available for DirecTV customers. ""Wow they must like me, I got $10 off per month for 12 months, Starz for free for 6 months, and NFL Sunday Ticket for $99. So I come out $20 ahead after a year,"" one commenter wrote on a forum on the site Satellite Guys. ""All I did was say I'd like to cancel due to the Viacom dispute. I was not expecting to get all that thrown at me."" A dispute between satellite provider DirecTV and the media company Viacom led late Tuesday to nearly 20 million customers losing access to 26 Viacom channels, including MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. CNNMoney has more information on the dispute: ""Viacom is seeking a 30% increase, or $1 billion more than its previous deal, DirecTV said in a statement. Viacom countered that its proposed increase totals 'a couple of pennies per day per subscriber.' Disputes between media companies and cable or satellite TV providers have become increasingly common, but this one is hitting an especially wide audience."" DirecTV announced that it would give its subscribers free access to premium Encore channels this month to show appreciation for their loyalty. ""To thank you for your patience until Viacom channels are returned, all eight Encore Channels (including Encore Family) will be made available to all customers thru July 31st,"" the company wrote Wednesday on its Facebook page. ""Tune to Channels 535 to 542 to start watching."" People who called the company, however, seemed to get better offers. Another commenter on the Satellite Guys forum wrote that he or she received ""$5 off for 3 months, $5 off Starz 6 months, $5 off Sports Pack 6 months"" from the company. ""(I) only asked about it, never said I wanted anything! Very well done Directv!"" that commenter wrote. ""I got $25 off of Premier for 6 months,"" wrote another person. CNN could not independently verify these reports. In response to a question about whether the company is offering deals to customers who threaten to leave, a spokesman said only that DirecTV is ""always willing to work with our customers to keep them happy."" ""We have not seen an impact on our subscriber numbers and an overwhelming number of our customers are telling us they will stick with us until this is resolved,"" the spokesman said in a statement. ""They appreciate that we are fighting on their behalf to keep their bills at an acceptable level."" Several forums reported relatively long wait times for people who placed calls to DirecTV. And the Internet is full of hate mail for both DirecTV and Viacom. CNNMoney tech reporter David Goldman said he called the company to complain about his service and was offered a deal similar to those being discussed in the online forums. ""I figured with the Viacom thing, DirecTV might be extra amenable to giving me a deal,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""Turns out I was right ... When I got someone and told her I was thinking of canceling, she found several deals to save me $25 a month and give me some nice perks. I'm getting $5 off HBO for 3 months, free DVR for 12 months ($10 off), and another $10 off my bill for 24 months. I also got NFL Sunday Ticket for free this year."" The deals didn't appear to placate all customers, however. ""Just scored $5.00 monthly credit and free Showtime for 3 months,"" one commenter wrote on a FatWallet.com forum.

"(CNN) -- Petrol bombs and stones were thrown at police protecting a gay pride march Sunday in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, an interior ministry representative told CNN. About 40 police officers were injured, and about 60 people were arrested, the ministry's Suzana Vasiljevic told CNN. None of the marchers were injured. Interior Minister Ivica Dacic had urged people to allow the march to go ahead without incident, Serbia's Tanjug news agency reported Saturday. ""It is very important that the event, which might be disagreeable to most of Serbia's citizens, goes by without incidents,"" Dacic said in Belgrade. A gay pride march in 2001 -- thought to be the country's first -- was attacked, resulting in some injuries. Last year's march was canceled due to security concerns after a wave of anti-gay graffiti appeared before the event, news reports at the time said. About 1,000 people participated in this year's march, guarded by close to 5,000 police officers, Vasiljevic said. A number of streets were closed for the event, and international diplomats were scheduled to observe it, according to the interior ministry.

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of flights were canceled Wednesday nationwide -- including Chicago and Denver -- because of bad weather, airport officials said. Airlines reported 400 cancellations out of 1,700 flights daily at Denver International Airport because of a storm that was forecast to dump 7 inches of snow in the area, the airport said at 2:50 p.m. (4:50 p.m. ET). The announcement came before the heavy snow had arrived. Delays at the Denver airport averaged just over two hours and 15 minutes, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. And there would be no home runs flying out of Coors Field either, as snow prompted the postponement of Wednesday's night baseball game between the Colorado Rockies and New York Mets. The city's National Weather Service forecast calls for snow continuing into Wednesday night, when temperatures should dip to as low as 15 degrees. The weather should take a marked turn for the better later in the week, with a 49-degree high and mostly sunny skies predicted for Friday. Strong storm causes damage in Oklahoma . Other parts of Colorado -- specifically northern El Paso County, including Monument and Black Forest -- were under a blizzard warning through Thursday morning. The National Weather Service forecasts that communities in this area could see up to 6 inches of snow and winds averaging 20 to 40 mph, with gusts blowing at speeds of up to 60 mph. At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, meanwhile, more than 300 flights were canceled because of strong rainstorms. The Chicago Department of Aviation reported the cancellations at 3:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET), though the situation didn't necessarily get better as the day wore on. At 6 p.m., the FAA reported that flights were arriving more than four hours later than usual. Delays for flights that were still on -- both in and out of the busy Illinois airport -- averaged one hour or more. Airlines reported delays of 30 minutes or more at Midway, another Chicago airport, the city department said. The showers and thunderstorms hitting the region Wednesday are expected to continue into Thursday.

"(CNN) -- Five, maybe 10 minutes was all it took. Shortly before midnight Monday, three inmates at the Butler County, Missouri, jail -- two of them accused killers -- slipped into a shower stall, through a shifted ceiling tile and eventually outside to the rural Ozark Foothills region of southeast Missouri. ""There are some things that you have to scratch your head about in the (jail's) design and construction,"" Butler County Sheriff Mark Dobbs said. ""And there's also the (fact there) are two people watching 95 inmates."" The men -- Joe Green, jailed on numerous assault charges, as well as accused killers Matthew Brandon Cook and Kade Reaves Stringfellow -- remained at large until Tuesday afternoon. Around 3:30 p.m. (4:30 p.m. ET), they were found hiding in a vehicle in a salvage yard about five miles east of Poplar Bluff, said Trooper Clark Parrott of the Missouri Highway Patrol. Video later showed all three men being taken out of police cars and led back into the jail. ""It's been a very long night and a very long day,"" Dobbs told reporters after the men's capture. The part of the shower stall where the men escaped was out of sight of cameras, as well as the two guards, according to the sheriff. He noted that there wasn't any noise to indicate anything was awry. The inmates crawled up through about a 10-inch by 10-inch hole above the ductwork, before eventually making their way outside -- an escape made easier because the walls ""didn't extend completely up to the concrete ceiling,"" Dobbs said. ""They were in and out in what we feel like was a relatively short amount of time,"" he said. Numerous law enforcement agencies -- from as far away as Little Rock, Arkansas, as well as helicopters from the Missouri Highway Patrol -- assisted in the search for the three men. The inmates traveled together alongside a flat, exposed and elevated railroad track, Dobbs said, pointing to an analysis of their tracks and preliminary interviews with the men. They were wearing bright orange jumpsuits. The fact they were so visible, especially in broad daylight and in an area where many citizens own guns, appeared to weigh on the three men's minds, Dobbs said. "" 'If I'd have been a citizen, I'd have shot me, too,' "" one of the escapees said, according to Dobbs. ""You're down in southeast Missouri, the gun belt, and people will protect themselves."" A tracking dog eventually led authorities to the salvage yard in a rural part of Butler County. The sheriff said he still believes the inmates intended to leave the area, but a combination of factors -- including the fact they were exposed and a large law enforcement team looking for them -- contributed to their capture. ""Luck was on our side this time, as well as a lot of good teamwork,"" Dobbs said.","NEW: One inmate feared he'd be shot by residents, a local sheriff says .

"(CNN) -- The entire first floor had a rust-colored ring 3 feet high where Sandy had left its mark. The damaged furniture had already been tossed, and all that was left was a concrete floor and bare walls. Our AmeriCares ""Operation Muck-Out"" team immediately got to work, ripping out the interior walls and removing the insulation until only wooden beams were standing. As the drywall crumbled in our hands, we shoveled it into trash bags in a cloud of white dust, and hauled it off to the curb. I spent most of the day dismantling the kitchen, ripping out cabinets and countertops with a crowbar. Everything was almost new -- installed only six years ago -- but had to go, because it had been soaked by Sandy. The homeowner's 84-year-old father helped me carry out the heavier appliances. Nearly two weeks after the storm, the gas stove was still dripping wet as we lugged it to the curb. By the time we finished, the entire contents of the first floor were sitting in the street waiting to be hauled away by the heavy equipment making its way through the Rockaways section of Queens, New York. Through it all, the owner, Nick, stayed remarkably composed as complete strangers took apart his home. When we asked how he was able to able to hold it together under such trying circumstances, he shrugged off the question. The worst was over, he said; everything he owned had already been discarded. He was channeling all of the energy he had left into the cleanup and rebuilding. Jersey Shore community gives thanks even after Sandy . Just a few blocks away, Stan -- who had never had so much as a drop of water in his basement in 40 years, until Sandy -- had just finished cleaning up flood damage with the help of another team of volunteers. He showed us how the water had risen almost to the top of the basement stairs, about 9 feet high. This Thanksgiving, my thoughts turn to Nick, Stan and the thousands of other storm victims in New York and New Jersey who are homeless this holiday season. Many are living with family members or in shelters and, if they are lucky, will be able to move back after New Year's. They remind me how thankful I am to be part of an organization that's making a difference for East Coast residents still dealing with power outages and putting their homes back together. The cleanup we joined in the Rockaways is just one of dozens of AmeriCares Hurricane Sandy relief projects. Every day since the storm, our relief workers have been out in the field offering help to first responders, health care providers and shelter officials. AmeriCares also has a mobile clinic traveling the streets of New York City, providing portable exam rooms for health clinics unable to treat patients due to damaged facilities. Staying afloat after Sandy . In Staten Island, where some residents have been without power for weeks, our relief workers are going door to door delivering sleeping bags to families without heat. And in Long Island, where thousands of people have been temporarily displaced, we delivered medical aid to a shelter housing hundreds of families. When our relief workers arrived, shelter officials were grappling with how to care for a large population with chronic illness. About one-third of the shelter dwellers are diabetics and the shelter had no way to safely store insulin, so we bought them a refrigerator. We also delivered wheelchairs, medical cots and 1,400 pounds of medical aid -- everything from cough and cold medicines to first aid supplies. AmeriCares has been responding to disasters all over the world for 30 years, and helping people in crisis is what we do best. But this disaster is personal for many of us because it happened in our own backyard. We are committed to see the storm victims through the recovery, just as we did in New Orleans and Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina. Not everyone can be a relief worker on the front lines of an emergency, but we can all make a difference by supporting organizations like AmeriCares that assist the survivors.

"(CNN) -- Ancient footprints discovered in northern Kenya are believed to be the oldest sign that early humans had feet like ours. The footprints were found in two sedimentary layers, 1.5 million years old, near Ileret in the eastern African nation. The footprints were found in two sedimentary layers, 1.5 million years old, near Ileret in the eastern African nation. ""These rarest of impressions yielded information about soft tissue form and structure not normally accessible in fossilized bones. The Ileret footprints constitute the oldest evidence of an essentially modern human-like foot anatomy,"" according to a team of anthropologists who detailed the discovery in the February 27 issue of the journal Science.   The team, led by anthropologist Professor John W.K. Harris and an international group of colleagues, excavated the site between 2006 and 2008. Harris, who teaches at Rutgers University and the State University of New Jersey, is a member of the Center for Human Evolutionary Studies and directs the Koobi Fora Field Project. The ongoing excavation project is run by Rutgers in collaboration with the National Museums of Kenya. Koobi Fora refers to a region around Koobi Fora Ridge, located on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana. The area has been a rich resource for excavations. According to the authors of the journal article, there were three footprint trails in the upper sediment layer. Five meters deeper, another sediment surface preserved one trail of two prints and a single, smaller print, likely from a child. ""In these specimens, the big toe is parallel to the other toes, unlike that of apes where it is separated in a grasping configuration useful in the trees. The footprints show a pronounced human-like arch and short toes, typically associated with an upright bipedal stance,"" the scientists said. ""The size, spacing and depth of the impressions were the basis of estimates of weight, stride and gait, all found to be within the range of modern humans."" The size and other characteristics of the prints led the authors to conclude the prints belonged to the hominid Homo ergaster, or early Homo erectus. This is the first hominid to have had the same body proportions -- longer legs and shorter arms -- as modern Homo sapiens. Other hominid fossil footprints dating to 3.6 million years ago were discovered in 1978 by Mary Leakey at Laetoli, Tanzania. ""These are attributed to the less advanced Australopithecus afarensis, a possible ancestral hominid. The smaller, older Laetoli prints show indications of upright bipedal posture, but possess a shallower arch and a more ape-like, divergent big toe,"" the authors said.","The footprints were found in two sedimentary layers that were 1.5 million years old .

"Washington (CNN) -- An al Qaeda video calling for ""electronic jihad"" illustrates the urgent need for cybersecurity standards for the most critical networks in the United States, a group of senators said. ""Internet piracy is an important field of jihad,"" the narrator of the video says, according to a translation. He advises followers with expertise to ""target the websites and information systems of big companies and government agencies of the countries that attack Muslims."" The video calls for cyberattacks against networks such as the electric grid and compares vulnerabilities in the United States' critical cyber networks to the vulnerabilities in the country's aviation system before 9/11, according to a statement Tuesday from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. ""This is the clearest evidence we've seen that Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups want to attack the cyber systems of our critical infrastructure,"" committee chairman Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut independent, said in the statement.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The most complicated neighborhood in the world is even more uncertain these days, and what you see ranges from breathtaking to heart-stopping. In Ramallah, West Bank, there are fancier cars and more economic activity than when I last visited five years ago. That isn't the only big change: In the early days of the Obama presidency the new American president inspired hope across the Arab world. Now, there are posters and protests critical of the president, and some harsh words from everyday Palestinians. Gaza, though, makes Ramallah look like a booming metropolis. It takes only a few yards past the Hamas checkpoint to wonder whether you stepped through a time portal: There are carts drawn by donkeys and horses, and poverty that makes you cringe. Palestinians: The big divide . In Gaza City, a billboard reminds you only fools get optimistic about prospects for peace here: It is a celebration of the Hamas military wing that is responsible for, among other things, rocket attacks in Israeli communities. It doesn't have to be this way: We visited a soda bottling plant and a furniture factory that offer economic hope. But the owners of both say employment is way down -- from 150 people to 20 at the furniture factory -- because they can no longer export through Israel and have trouble getting supplies. Just about everyone in Gaza blames Israel. But several passersby, after nervously looking around, also told me Hamas shared some of the blame for making peace such a distant hope. This will linger: the smiles and jokes from children who came to say hello and get some candy from my CNN colleague Tasha Diakides. Their eyes still sparkle with hope, a counterbalance to the violent graffiti and posters that make one worry if the leaders here can ever set aside their hate and mistrust. 5 things to know about Obama's first presidential visit to Israel . This is my ninth visit to Israel in the past 25 years, and I'm always reminded of college and my first reporting job in Rhode Island: Everything is so close. Gaza to Jerusalem is just shy of 50 miles. Drive a few more -- again toward Ramallah -- and you are better schooled in how land is the currency of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Arab villages abut Israeli settlements like Efrat and Ma'ale Adumim. Is this the way it is supposed to be? Or is it an Israeli effort to ""change the facts on the ground""? It depends on whom you ask, of course. The one thing those with different answers seem to share is distrust of those who disagree with them. Opinion: Obama's Israel trip is about legacy . You can hear gunfire every day. On a West Bank hillside we visited Caliber 3, a security training academy. Vigilance is the motto here, and among those learning hand to hand combat and marksmanship are security personnel for the Jerusalem light rail and Jewish settlers who are part of their community security structure. The man who runs the school is a combat veteran and colonel in the Israeli reserves. He laughs while telling the story of how his mother hoped there would be peace and he would never have to serve in the Army. Sharon Gat says he is already telling his children they are all but certain to serve because, as he put it so simply, ""you live in Israel."" Jerusalem is the Holy Land, cherished ground to three great faiths: Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A walk through history is also a reminder of how home, the United States, is, from a chronological perspective, a baby in the world. Israeli president: No doubt Obama has Israel's back . From the Old City to Tel Aviv is just 34 miles as the bird flies but a fast-forward in time: There, high-tech rules, and the walkway along the Mediterranean Sea is packed with young Israeli professionals and their families. Most aren't interested in talking politics. Those who will have mixed opinions of President Obama, and if nothing else voiced hope this trip would melt away some of the personal chill between the U.S. president and their prime minister. Like the young eyes in Gaza, the stunning sunset here gives pause, and can't help but make you think this is supposed to be a less fragile place.","John King is in Mideast covering President Obama's visit .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The Los Angeles public school system is going to pay $30 million to settle 58 of 191 students' lawsuits alleging they were victims of sexually lewd acts by an elementary school teacher, two of the plaintiff attorneys said. David Holmquist, general counsel for the Los Angeles Unified School District, confirmed the settlements in 58 cases but declined to state the exact financial figure other than so say the amount was in the ""multimillions."" The two plaintiff attorneys provided the figure on the condition that they wouldn't be identified because a Los Angeles County judge has yet to approve the settlement. Holmquist described the agreements as ""good settlements."" However, four of the 17 law firms suing the school district haven't agreed to any settlement, attorneys said. The nearly 200 students' claims were filed in the wake of charges against former Miramonte Elementary School teacher Mark Berndt, 62, who pleaded not guilty last year to allegations he put young students in bondage and then photographed them with semen-filled spoons held at their mouths and 3-inch cockroaches crawling across their faces. Berndt is being held on $23 million bail and faces 23 felony counts of lewd acts on a child. The 23 alleged victims were between 7 and 10 years old, and all but two of them were girls, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has said. Several of the plaintiff attorneys couldn't say for certain this week whether any of the 23 alleged victims in the criminal case are among the 58 civil settlements. Taxpayer money and possibly school insurance funds will pay for the settlements, Holmquist said. The two goals of the settlements are to ""restore some healing to the community"" and ""provide for health and education needs for the students going forward,"" he said. ""We're not admitting liability, but we realize it's a tragic circumstance for sure,"" Holmquist said. ""Students have definitely suffered, so in what we think is in the best interest of students, we thought we would put this behind us by resolving it through remediation and early dispute resolution."" The school system has ""every reason to believe the judge will approve"" the settlements, Holmquist said. In the 58 settlements, each student and his or her family is receiving about $400,000 to $500,000 each, the plaintiff attorneys said. Luis Carrillo, one of the attorneys who have declined to settle with the school system, said the district isn't acting in good faith. ""The last agreements that the district has settled before Miramonte were a much bigger amount, and I think the amount of money they are offering now is very, very low in comparison to what they have paid in the past,"" Carrillo said. ""We think the amount of money that they are getting right now is insufficient for the huge damage they have caused to the children,"" he said.","Two of the attorneys say total settlement is $30 million in 58 of 191 students' cases .

"Washington (CNN) -- A government-appointed commission will start reviewing Thursday ways to permanently store the United States' nuclear waste. The Department of Energy's Blue Ribbon Commission has been given the task of finding an alternative to the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada, which President Obama has vowed to close. The government has spent nearly $10 billion studying the Yucca Mountain location, and the Obama administration estimates that ending the program will save $197 million in 2011. The Obama administration announced in January that the blue-ribbon panel would take a new look at the problem. The panel is headed by former Democratic Rep. Lee Hamilton and former Republican National Security adviser Brent Scowcroft.  Read the commission's charter . It is highly likely that the 15-member commission will abandon the option to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. It is expected to take 18 months for the commission to conclude its findings, and that isn't sitting well with several lawmakers from states with temporary nuclear waste storage sites. House members Tuesday introduced a bipartisan resolution to block the closure of Yucca Mountain, according to media reports. Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Washington, said the resolution calls on the Department of Energy to follow the will of Congress. ""Keeping waste scattered across the country, or in the case of Washington State at Hanford, is no longer an option,"" Inslee said in a statement. ""We have a solution to this problem and we must move forward."" The Hanford facility is one of more than 100 nuclear sites across the country where about 70,000 tons of radioactive waste are stored. An estimated 2,000 tons are added every year.  How federal funds are being used to clean up Hanford . After uranium has been used in a reactor, the spent fuel remains radioactive for thousands of years. It is taken out and put into a pool of water, or above ground in canisters made of concrete, steel and lead. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says the canisters are certified for up to 90 years of use, but that term may be extended. Both supporters and opponents of nuclear power largely agree that storing the material in casks at nuclear plants is no long-term solution. If the blue-ribbon commission decides to abandon Yucca Mountain as a nuclear storage facility, there are concerns in southern Nevada over what will be done with the site. ""For years, there's never been a fallback, there's never been a plan B,"" says Michael Voegele, who's been involved with the Yucca Mountain project for decades. Voegele, a consultant with Nevada's Nye County, says it was ""only recently"" that people began to discuss other possible uses for the site. The search for future uses of Yucca only came into question, according to Voegele and others, when the Department of Energy filed a petition to withdraw its Nuclear Regulatory Commission license application for Yucca Mountain earlier this month, effectively killing the project. The Department of Energy filed its petition to withdraw the license application with prejudice, which would prevent it from being refilled. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has fought hard to end the Yucca Mountain project, which is unpopular with many Nevadans.  He has asked the Government Accountability Office to consider alternative uses for the site. Those alternatives include national security activities and renewable energy research. But the closure of the project could have a major economic impact in the region. Gary Hollis, the chairman of the Nye County Board of Commissioners, says closing Yucca Mountain slams the door on 4,000 construction jobs and about 1,500 permanent jobs that would have been created if the site ever got up and running. CNN's Brian Larch, David Mattingly and Dugald McConnell contributed to this report.","Government panel reviewing where to store nuclear waste .

"(CNN) -- An investigative judge has placed former French President Nicolas Sarkozy under formal investigation for breach of trust, accusing him of taking advantage of elderly L'Oreal cosmetic heiress Liliane Bettencourt to help fund his 2007 campaign, Sarkozy's attorney said, according to CNN affiliate BFM-TV. The former president was summoned to appear at Judge Jean-Michel Gentil's office in Bordeaux on Thursday in a case in which he is suspected of accepting illegal contributions from Bettencourt and her staff, BFM-TV said. His lawyer, Thierry Herzog, said that he intends to appeal the ruling, according to BFM-TV. The Bettencourt scandal has fascinated France since questions about the finances of France's richest woman emerged in 2011 amid a family feud. Although formal, the investigation of Sarkozy, 58, is considered preliminary, and could lead to trial or may go no further. The son of a Hungarian refugee father and French mother, Sarkozy was 28 when he became mayor of Neuilly, a Paris suburb. He left that post in 2002 to serve as interior minister and then finance minister under President Jacques Chirac. (Chirac was convicted in 2011 on corruption charges tied to his time as Paris mayor.) Ten days after his runoff election win, Sarkozy became president in 2007. He served in that capacity for the next five years, garnering praise for his work on foreign policy issues and criticism for his handling of domestic issues as France's economy sputtered and unemployment rate hovered at about 10%. In May 2012, Francois Hollande beat Sarkozy in his bid to win a second term as president. And just over two months later -- one day after he and his family were set to head off to Canada for a vacation -- police raided his home and office as part of their investigation into possible illegal campaign financing, according to Herzog. ""It's not a surprise,"" Christian Mallard, a senior foreign analyst for France Television, said at the time. After losing his re-election bid, Sarkozy ""was going to lose his diplomatic immunity,"" opening him up to potential prosecution. In fact, the probe appeared well under way by then. In September -- when Sarkozy was still president -- three investigators engaged in an hourlong search of his political party headquarters, seeking documents linking his campaign to the alleged political contributions from Bettencourt. Judge Jean-Michel Gentil questioned the former French leader in November for 12 hours concerning evidence given by Bettencourt's former accountant, Claire Thibout, BFM-TV reported. Afterward, authorities said they'd decided not to pursue a formal investigation of Sarkozy, but rather to treat him as what officials call a ""witness-under-caution."" The phrase is a technical term that essentially allows a French magistrate to continue to call the ex-president to the witness stand. At the same time, it didn't close the door to Sarkozy facing criminal charges stemming from allegedly illicit campaign donations.","Nicolas Sarkozy served as France's president between 2007 and 2012 .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China's trade surplus widened further in October to $32 billion as exports swelled 11.6%, the strongest rise since May, state-run news agency Xinhua reported Saturday. During the same period, imports rose 2.4% year-on-year, the same rate of growth recorded in September. In the first ten months of 2012, the country's total foreign trade expanded 6.3% to $3.16 trillion compared to the same period last year. China had set a target of target of 10% growth in foreign trade this year, however the country's commerce minister has said that will be difficult to achieve. ""Even though our year-on-year export growth rate rebounded slightly to 9.9% in September and 11% in October, it remains very difficult for us to achieve the 10% foreign trade growth target for the whole year,"" Chen said on the sidelines of the Communist Party's 18th National Congress in Beijing, according to Xinhua. Read more: Hu warns of corruption threat . Chen said that China could instead expect to maintain its share of global trade. Last year, China's trade surged 22.5 percent, however this year weak global demand, higher operating costs and growing trade protectionism were putting pressure on exports, Xinhua reported. In the first ten months of this year, trade with China's largest trading partner, the European Union fell 3% amid a severe economic downturn and a series of severe austerity measures. A territorial dispute between China and Japan has also taken a toll on their economic relations, pushing trade between the two down by 2.1%. Read more: Will the music stop for China's economy?

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- It was Newrouz, the first day of spring and the Kurdish New Year but was it also the beginning of a new era in Turkey's troubled relation with its Kurdish population? There was certainly a mood of optimism in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, where hundreds of thousands assembled not just to ring in the new but to try to draw a line under the past. They listened to a speech written by the imprisoned Abdullah Ocalan, founder of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), and leader of a violent insurrection that began in Turkey in 1984. The crowd broke into cheers when Sirri Sureyya Onder -- a pro-Kurdish Member of Parliament for the Peace and Democracy Party -- speaking on Ocalan's behalf, said the time had come ""for the guns to be silent and to let ideas and diplomacy speak."" READ: PKK calls for dialogue in Turkey . The holiday mood was in stark contrast to previous Newrouz assemblies in the 1990s which were akin to intifada with rioters throwing Molotov cocktails and security forces firing back live rounds. Yet for many in Turkey, pessimism is still the default mode. It is one thing, as Ocalan did Thursday, to call on PKK fighters to begin a controlled withdraw from Turkish territory. What his own supporters now want to hear is what they get in return. The key question is whether the Turkish government has the will and the political skill to meet a slew of Kurdish nationalist demands. These are almost certain to include the right to use Kurdish as an official language in government offices and in schools and also for a form of political devolution. They will also demand the release of the large number (some put the figure at more than 8,000) of political activists now in pre-trial detention under Turkey's sweeping anti-terror legislation. Finally, and most problematically, the PKK, will demand a means of rehabilitating their own militants, including if not actual freedom, some form of house arrest for Ocalan himself. Turkey has every incentive for acting now and for acting quickly. One of Turkey's largest trading partners is now the Kurdish Autonomous Region in the north of Iraq. Ankara, too, is anxious to prevent the conflict in Syria, where Kurds are becoming ever more autonomous, from spreading over its border. The long war of attrition with the Kurdistan Workers Party has been costly in terms of about 40,000 lives lost and an actual price tag some put at $1 trillion. A Turkey at peace with itself could be a potent force in the decades ahead. Yet the Turkish Prime Minister, Tayyip Erdogan, knows he risks alienating his own supporters if he is seen to be making too many concessions, too rapidly. He called the Newrouz events a ""positive development"" during a trip to Holland, but then chided the crowds for their lack of patriotism in not waving Turkish flags. Even so, the government will be relieved that the rally did not become a show of the PKK's strength. So, while the Diyarbakir meeting took the form of Ocalan addressing his supporters, there was another message to Turkish public opinion. The speech evoked the great moments of nation building in the country's history: the First World War battlefield of Gallipoli ""when Turks and Kurds fell in battle shoulder to shoulder,"" the War of Independence and the First National Assembly. Turks have long been taught Kurdish identity politics is a threat to national unity. If peace is to have a chance, they will have to get used to the idea. For the imprisoned Ocalan himself, Thursday's rally in Diyarbakir is just the latest step in political rehabilitation. He was vilified as ""a baby killer"" when he was captured and extradited back to Turkey in 1999. However in recent months he has been the principal negotiator in the peace process. Last November, he was instrumental in having a hunger strike called off among imprisoned detainees. In 1999, I sat in a purpose-built court house on the Turkish island of Imrali, watching Abdullah Ocalan being sentenced to death. His last remarks to the judge were far from contrite. He did not deny responsibility for leading bloody insurrection. Instead, he said it was time to move on. If the government ever intended to get the PKK down from the mountains and bring about peace they would have to come to him. Nearly 14 years later, his words are coming true.","Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) calls for dialogue to end violence that began in 1984 .

"(CNN) -- Wait -- we weren't done pondering the Xbox 720. So what, if anything, is ""Xbox 8""? The real, no-fun, answer is ""maybe nothing."" But it's been enough to kick up a round of speculation among tech and gaming enthusiasts after Microsoft fought, and won, against a cybersquatter who had grabbed the Web address for that name. The National Arbitration Forum, which handles international business disputes, ruled in Microsoft's favor in a complaint against a Chinese national who had filed for a whole host of addresses representing both current and imagined products. They included XboxPhone.com, XboxTablet.com, XboxLiveTV.com, XboxCompanion.com, Xbox8.us and Xbox8.org. Microsoft filed the complaints in May. Tech site Fusible reports that the domains listed in the disputes were ordered transferred to Microsoft in late June after two separate panels found the man who filed for them had no rights to the domains and that they were being used ""in bad faith."" The inclusion of ""Xbox 8"" may have just been a matter of Microsoft gaining control over anything that looks as if it should be theirs. But its inclusion alongside other names that are easier to explain sparked speculation online Tuesday about what the name might mean. Many observers immediately wondered whether it might be the name of the next Xbox gaming and entertainment console. Microsoft is widely expected to roll out a new version of its popular Xbox 360 console within the next year. The name most people expect? Xbox 720. Last month, a 56-page document from Microsoft was leaked. Dating back to mid-2010, the document contained plans for an ""Xbox 720"" that utilizes the new Xbox SmartGlass system and new hardware for its Kinect motion-recognition system. Perhaps a better guess is that ""Xbox 8"" could be software. Windows 8 promises to be a massive overhaul of the operating system that will marry PCs with tablets and smartphones. It stands to reason that the Xbox will be included and ""Xbox 8"" would make sense in this regard. Of course, imagining a new console is more exciting. ""XBox 8? Didn't know the XBox 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 came out,"" one Twitter user wrote. Alas, says gaming site Joystiq: . ""It's tempting to suspect Microsoft is eyeing 'Xbox 8' as the next console name due to the two domains that reference it; however, Microsoft already began integrating Xbox Live, and the 'Xbox' name, into all its consumer products, including Windows 8. Also, it would be really weird if a domain squatter guessed the name.""","Microsoft secures Web addresses for ""Xbox 8""

"(CNN) -- Two Steubenville, Ohio, football stars sexually assaulted a 16-year-old girl, treating her ""like a toy,"" a state prosecutor said Wednesday in the opening statement of the teens' rape trial. Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, are accused of sexually assaulting the girl at a series of end-of-summer parties in August, according to prosecutors. The case received widespread attention nationally after other Steubenville teens posted images of the alleged victim seemingly unconscious to social media sites. Defense attorneys say the boys are innocent of rape. Mays is also charged with illegal use of a minor in nudity oriented material. Although they are minors, they have been identified in court by the judge and attorneys, and in newspapers and other media reports. CNN is not naming the 16-year-old girl in line with its policy of not identifying the alleged victims of sexual assault. Prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter detailed a string of degrading abuse she said the girl suffered at the hands of the boys, including having her clothes stripped off, while other teens joked about urinating on her. She said they had ""treated her like a toy."" Some of the abuse was captured in cellphone images retrieved from either the Internet or their phones. One, Hemmeter said, showed the girl lying naked on her side, apparently asleep, with what appeared to be semen on her stomach. Hemmeter said witnesses will testify that the girl was highly intoxicated -- stumbling, slurring her speech, at times unable to walk. Such impairment, Hemmeter said, would be the state's focus in proving the allegations against Mays and Richmond, not whether the girl consented. The girl, Hemmeter said, was ""too impaired to say no, too impaired to say stop."" In a brief opening statement, one of Mays' defense attorneys, Brian Duncan, told the judge that his client did not rape the girl. ""Trent Mays did not rape the alleged victim, and the prosecution cannot and will not be able to establish and substantiate their claim,"" Duncan said. Richmond's attorney, Walter Madison, did not make an opening statement. Six witnesses for the prosecution testified Wednesday, including a 17-year-old girl who went to a party with the alleged victim. The witness said she and the girl shared a half a bottle of vodka, which they each poured into a flavored crushed ice drink. The alleged victim also had one beer, the witness said. The alleged victim seemed to get drunk very quickly, the witness said. About 12:30 a.m., the party broke up and the girl left with Mays and Richmond, according to the witness who said she pleaded with her not go. The witness said she didn't see her again until the next day when she picked the alleged victim up at another home. She described the girl as a ""mess"" with her shirt inside out. Other witnesses said the girl appeared drunk on the night in question while she was at the second house. Two police officer also testified, describing how they collected evidence. During cross examinations, the teen's lawyers' tried to poke holes in the witnesses' stories. While being quizzed by defense attorneys, at least one witness said he did not see the alleged victim drinking and he did not see Mays involved in any sexual contact with the alleged victim. Another witness said, during cross examination, that she saw the alleged victim bring a bottle of vodka with her to one of the end-of-summer parties in August. The case, which is being tried before Judge Thomas Lipps without a jury, has cast an unwelcome spotlight on Steubenville, a small, down-on-its-luck town along the banks of the Ohio River. Social media . Photos, video and social media messages -- some of which the prosecutor displayed Wednesday in court -- are at the heart of criminal charges against Mays and Richmond. Crime blogger Alexandria Goddard, a former Steubenville resident, discovered and preserved many of the online messages about the case, at least some of which are now in the hands of authorities. The girl's mother also gathered some of the material from social media and brought it to authorities. One image circulated online and posted on a website maintained by Anonymous, a loosely organized cooperative of activist hackers, showed the girl, dressed in a T-shirt and blue shorts, her body limp, being held hand and foot by two males who appear to be teenagers. Text messages posted to social networking sites that night seemed to brag about the incident, calling the girl ""sloppy,"" making references to rape and suggesting that she had been urinated on, Goddard has said. CNN has not been able to establish whether this is true. In one 12-minute video, a teenager who is not charged in the case jokes about the girl's condition, saying she must have died because she didn't move during one assault. Police got involved on August 14, when the girl's mother reported the alleged assaults, according to Steubenville Police Chief William McCafferty. The family provided a zip drive showing a Twitter page, possibly with a photo, McCafferty said. Unwanted spotlight . The allegations -- and the shadow it has cast over the town -- have gripped the area for months. The case has attracted the attention of bloggers and even Anonymous, who have questioned everything from the behavior of the football team to the veracity of the investigation. Rape allegations engulf town . Steubenville was once a thriving steel mill town. With the mills closed, the town is a shadow of its former self as some of its residents moved away to find work elsewhere and some businesses closed. Today, its population is primarily blue collar with a median income between $33,000 and $34,000, well below the national average. The Steubenville High School football games have long been a gathering point for residents, who point to the team's against-all-odds play that helped elevate its reputation in the state. Critics have accused community leaders of trying to paper over rampant misconduct by players of the Steubenville High School team and have suggested that other students took part in the assaults or failed to do enough stop them. While many residents express concern about the allegations against Mays and Richmond, they are also frustrated with how the town has been portrayed. ""We all want to see justice prevail for the victim and the defendants in this case. All of you are here today because you are doing your job and writing your story,"" Susan Hershey, the president of the Jefferson County Chamber of Commerce. ""There (are), however, always multiple sides to every story. There is the other side of our community, a side that has been overshadowed by this incident. Unfortunately, our community has been painted with one very unflattering, broad brush."" Opinion: Teach young men to treat women with respect .

"Washington (CNN) -- Almost two-thirds of Iowa's Republican political pros predict that former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney will win the state's caucuses on Tuesday, but his campaign's margin for error over Texas Rep. Ron Paul is slim. As the candidates dashed around the state making their closing arguments to a volatile caucus electorate, CNN surveyed 64 Iowa GOP insiders -- including state legislators, local elected and party officials, senior advisers to Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, business and conservative interest group leaders, veterans of previous caucus campaigns, and a variety of other party activists -- to assess the shape of the GOP race. In the CNN Iowa GOP insiders survey, a solid majority of the 64 Republican political pros thought Romney would finish first over Paul. Who will finish first? • Mitt Romney: .....40 (63%) • Ron Paul: .....17 (27%) • Michele Bachmann: .....1 (1%) • Newt Gingrich: .....1 (1%) • Rick Perry: .....1 (1%) • Rick Santorum: .....0 (0%) • Too close to call/dead heat: .....4 (6%) Three other Iowa GOP insiders thought the race was just too close to call between Romney and Paul, and they picked those two to finish in a dead heat. And another predicted a four-way traffic jam for first between Romney, Paul, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. While Santorum has been surging in the polls in the final week of campaigning, not a single Iowa GOP insider picked him to be the outright winner on caucus night. As one Iowa Republican explained, Romney has run a shrewder campaign than he did in his 2008 caucus effort, when he bet huge amounts of time and resources in the state expecting a victory, only to see former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee rally born-again and evangelical voters for the win. ""He has run a smart campaign; not the campaign that Iowa politicos would necessarily like to see, but the operation has done the right thing in Iowa from (managing) expectations to ads to finally deciding to play here,"" one GOP insider, who asked that his name not be used, said of Romney. ""What isn't written about enough is the value of the time he put in Iowa four years ago and how he still has staff and an extensive array of 'super volunteers' around the state. He has had the money and now you are starting to see some enthusiasm at his events. He wins a close caucus."" Indeed, when those same 64 Iowa GOP insiders were asked to predict the percentage of the caucus vote that each of the Republican White House hopefuls would capture, the race between Romney and Paul looked much tighter. Percentage of caucus vote expected . • Mitt Romney: .....24% . • Ron Paul: .....22% . • Rick Santorum: .....17% . • Newt Gingrich: .....15% . • Rick Perry: .....11% . • Michele Bachmann: .....7% . • Other: .....2% . • Jon Huntsman: .....1% . Romney is not without his challenges in the state. Some wonder whether his Mormon faith remains a barrier for him in a contest where 60% of participants in the 2008 GOP caucuses were born-again or evangelical Christians. But Romney's biggest challenge may be the feeling that he is too politically expedient. RELATED: Some Iowa Republicans want more options . RELATED: Will Iowa's evangelicals pick the GOP nominee? Asked what Romney's biggest hurdle in the state was, nearly two-thirds of the Iowa GOP insiders said that it was the perception that he tailored his positions depending on the politics of the moment -- far surpassing concerns over the health care reform measure he signed into law in Massachusetts or skepticism from born-again and evangelical voters. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Romney in Iowa? • Perception that he has changed views for political gain:.....64% . • Massachusetts health care law: .....22% . • Doubts about him among born-again/evangelical voters: .....14% . ""As a supporter (of another campaign) in 2008, I remember the attacks we tossed his way four years ago,"" said one GOP Iowa insider. ""The flip-flopper image remains."" But that liability may pale compared to handicaps Newt Gingrich has faced in the state. Once the front-runner in Iowa, Gingrich has had to endure a barrage of negative attacks, particularly from super-PACs supporting Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. And while Gingrich burst to the top of the pack in Iowa after the collapse of Herman Cain's campaign last fall, Iowa GOP insiders don't think he built the kind of political apparatus in the state that could buttress him as he's come under unrelenting fire. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Gingrich in Iowa? • The negative ads run against him: .....61% . • His lack of organization in the state: .....33% . • Doubts about him among born-again/evangelical voters: .....5% . • Personal baggage (volunteered): .....2% . ""While his lack of organization is a major issue, he could have conceivably overcome it if his face hadn't been ripped off by negative ads, which are running almost every other commercial,"" observed one GOP Iowa insider. But another averred, ""They have shown his record, which has been all over the map."" Romney's main rival in the caucuses, Paul, also has problems making more headway in the state. While the 76-year-old congressman has been able to cultivate a devoted following with a blend of libertarian and isolationist appeals, there's a sense among many Iowa GOP insiders that that kind of exotic brew ultimately makes him unacceptable to most Republicans in a primary and most general election voters in the fall. What do you think has been the biggest obstacle for Paul in Iowa? • His stance on foreign policy: .....56% . • Perception that he can't win in the general election: .....46% . • Doubts about him among born-again/evangelical voters: .....0% . ""His ideas are too extreme and he doesn't try to mainstream them,"" said another Iowa GOP insider. ""Paul's supporters don't care that he can't win,"" cracked another. ""His foreign policy stances ensure that he won't."" Whoever wins on Tuesday, Iowa Republicans believe the party rank and file, along with larger-than-normal numbers of independents attracted by Paul's candidacy, will flock to the caucuses. Half of the Iowa GOP insiders expect their turnout will be above the 119,000 mark set in the 2008 caucuses. While some of that may be wishful partisan thinking, only 11% think that turnout will drop, while 39% predict it will be about the same as four years ago. The CNN Iowa GOP insiders were surveyed from the evening of December 27 through the morning of December 30. Most of the survey was conducted over the Internet; some interviews were conducted by phone. The Iowa insiders were given anonymity for their individual answers in order to encourage candid responses. And while some insiders were aligned with one or another of the presidential campaigns, more than two-thirds said they had not endorsed and were not working for any candidate in the race.

"(CNN) -- A late Sergio Ramos goal earned Real Madrid a 2-1 win against Barcelona at the Bernabeu on Saturday as the La Liga leaders slumped to a second consecutive El Clasico defeat. Five days after being dumped out of the Copa del Rey by Jose Mourinho's side, the Catalan club were once again forced to play second fiddle to their archrivals. Read: Ronaldo double sinks Barca . Karim Benzema put the hosts ahead in the sixth minute, slotting home after Alvaro Morata had crossed from the left before Barca equalized 12 minutes later -- Lionel Messi collecting his 18th goal against Real Madrid and his 50th of the season. Cristiano Ronaldo came on as a sub in the second half and livened up proceedings, but it was Sergio Ramos who scored the winner eight minutes from the end, rising highest to head home Luka Modric's corner. Barcelona thought they should have been awarded a penalty in the final minute when, at the other end, Ramos appeared to trip Adriano but the referee didn't agree. An angry protest by Victor Valdes after the final whistle earned the goalkeeper a red card. The result takes Real to 55 points and within one point of second-place city rivals Atletico -- who travel to Malaga on Sunday. Despite the loss -- just their second in the league this season -- Barca are still way out ahead of on 68 points, but not in an unassailable position just yet, as the match winner Ramos pointed out. ""In the league 13 points is better than 16. We have reduced the distance and whilst it is still possible mathematically we are obliged to fight,"" Ramos said. But thoughts are already turning to Tuesday's last 16 Champions League match up against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Defender Pepe believes back-to-back wins over Barcelona can inspire Real to victory in the second leg with the tie evenly poised at 1-1. Blog: Pedro's Point of View . ""We are very happy with the victory and it was important to win. It gives us a lot of hope for the game on Tuesday, we have to go out and try to win the game in Manchester,"" Pepe said.

Lazio's chances of getting anything from the game were dealt a fatal blow when Antonio Candreva was shown a straight red after 17 minutes for a foul on Stephan El Shaarawy. Milan proceeded to dominate and two quick-fire goals at the end of the first half -- Pazzini in the 40th minute and Kevin Prince Boateng four minutes later -- effectively killed the contest. Read: Juventus stay six points clear . Pazzini, who is deputizing for the injured Mario Balotelli, scored his second of the night on the hour mark to put the game beyond the reach of the visitors. The win extends Milan's unbeaten league run to nine games and lifts them to fourth -- two points above city rivals Inter who travel to Catania on Sunday. Third place Lazio, meanwhile, have taken just five points from their last seven games.","Sergio Ramos headed goal earns Real Madrid second El Clasico win in five days .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- Dulce Matuz is beaming, smiling from ear to ear, standing in the gym of a high school outside Phoenix, Arizona. Around her, 15 kids who should be on spring break are cheering. Nearby is a robot, about 4 feet high, crafted from metal and stuffed with wires and circuits. It had just been announced the winner -- the top robot -- of the FIRST Robotics Arizona regional competition. The robotics competition challenges tens of thousands of high school students to fund, design and built robot with limited materials and time -- just six weeks. Each year, students on the robotics team at Carl Hayden Community High School name their creation after someone who inspires them. This robot's name is Dulce's Dream, for Matuz, the 26-year-old undocumented activist, a former member  of the team who still volunteers with them. Matuz was born in 1984, in Hermosillo, Mexico, about a seven-hour drive from Phoenix. When she was 15, she came to the United States to live with her mother, who had moved here previously. She enrolled as a sophomore at Carl Hayden, and one of her first classes was marine biology, taught by Fredi Lajvardi. At the time, Lajvardi was just starting the FIRST robotics team at the school and was looking for his first members. He showed Matuz's class a video of the competition and she was hooked. ""When he said you just needed to be willing to learn, that motivated me to go,"" she said. ""I thought 'I am the perfect candidate. I didn't even really speak English that well.' I certainly didn't know anything about robots."" She learned to build, improved her English, and soon Matuz was expanding her role. She designed the team's website, campaigned for donations, and gave speeches. Being on Lajvardi's robotics team wasn't just about robots -- every day was a lesson in opportunities beyond Carl Hayden High School. Meet Maria, a student on Carl Hayden's robotics team . Lajvardi puts a special emphasis on attending college. When Matuz was working on college applications during her senior year of high school, it became clear that her undocumented status could get in her way. ""I remember applying,"" she said, ""and it wouldn't let me do that because it was online and you had to have a social security number."" Matuz learned she does not have legal residency in the United States, and she is not a citizen. The Urban Institute estimates that 65,000 students like Matuz graduate from U.S. high schools every year. There is no federal law or state prohibiting colleges, either public or private, from admitting undocumented students. But there are numerous hurdles to earn that degree. Lajvardi and Matuz visited a recruiting counselor from Arizona State University, and in the end she was accepted. But as an undocumented student, Matuz didn't qualify for federal financial aid. Lajvardi took Matuz to meeting after meeting, until they found private scholarships that would allow her to start at the university in fall 2003. Matuz went on to graduate with a degree in electrical engineering, but unlike a lot of her peers, it wasn't a celebratory experience for her. ""I knew there was a problem, but at the same time, everyone tells you, 'If you work hard and be a good student that things will align and work out,'"" she said. ""And it was true, so far, because I was able to go to college and graduate, but at the same time, I think, reality really sunk in and I got depressed because I was seeing my peers take internships or getting full-time jobs at engineering firms ... I know I was capable of getting that job but I couldn't get it because of my status."" Unable to work in engineering after graduating, Matuz continued working the real estate job she had during college. Organizing other undocumented students became her passion. During her crusade to attend college, she had met hundreds of other young people like herself -- she realized she wasn't alone. She started organizing other people, and together, they began campaigning for passage of the DREAM Act, a proposal to allow a path to citizenship for undocumented students after completion of a college degree or military service. Then came the moment Matuz took a stand. She and several other students traveled from Phoenix to Washington with the goal of asking senators, in person, to put the DREAM Act back on the Senate calendar for a vote. They chose the office of Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican whom they thought could play a key role in advancing the act. In the office, they asked for a meeting, and then sat on the floor. They stayed until 7 p.m., when the office closed. When police asked them to leave, they refused to go, and in the end Matuz and three friends spent the night in jail. She said she doesn't regret that night. ""We did everything we could,"" she said. ""I think I would have felt worse if I didn't get arrested because then I would have felt like, 'Oh, I should have done this and done that,' but it was also a relief because I know I did everything."" The DREAM Act failed in the last session of Congress. Recently, President Obama has made a push for ""widespread movement"" of immigration reform, and encouraged Congress to pass the DREAM Act. Opinion: Obama, stop deportation of DREAM students . When the students at Carl Hayden high school heard about her arrest, they were inspired to know a former student, someone much like themselves, led a national charge for a cause. At the school, which is 94% Latino, robotics coach Lajvardi estimates that many students are undocumented, like Matuz. ""It helps maybe motivate some children that some students that we have here on campus that might be in her same situation in the future,"" Lajvardi said. Current robotics team members have led marches and petitioned their legislature for reform. ""A lot of our team is aware of the situation,"" said team member Maria Castro, ""and a lot of us, if it's not directly, [are] indirectly affected by it."" After the team won the regional competition, they moved on to the nationals in St. Louis. Matuz traveled there with the team to cheer them on. She compared having a robot named after her to winning the lottery. ""It's like a driving force and it goes in a circle,"" she said. ""They motivate me and I hope I motivate them."" ""Sometimes,"" she added, ""we are afraid of pursuing our dreams, but Fredi [Lajvardi] said, 'You don't have to be afraid, it's a matter of how you are going to control that feeling to continue.' Am I going to let my immigration status dictate my life? Or am I going to let being afraid dictate my life?"" Her answer? Neither.","Dulce Matuz is an undocumented graduate of Arizona State University .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two days after a Federal Aviation Administration official told contractors that steps were being taken to shut down 168 air traffic control towers on April 1, the agency gave the towers an unexpected reprieve Friday, saying the official's comments were ""unauthorized."" In a telephone conference call on Wednesday, an FAA official told contractors who operate the towers they would soon be receiving a letter giving notice that 168 towers would be closed on the first day of April because of government-wide spending cuts that were set in motion on Friday night. Another 16 towers would be closed on September 30, the end of the fiscal year, the official said. But the news -- devastating to the three companies and hundreds of employees who staff the towers -- was short-lived. On Friday, the FAA arranged a second conference call, retracting without explanation the earlier call, according to Spencer Dickerson, head of the U.S. Control Tower Association. The contractors were told that the first call ""was not an authorized call,"" Dickerson said. But Dickerson questioned that. The Wednesday conference call ""wasn't just some coffee break conversation at the water cooler,"" he said, saying it included FAA officials and representatives of all three contractors who operate FAA control towers in the United States. The move prolongs operation of the contract towers at least a couple of weeks, said Shane Cordes, head of Midwest ATC Service, who called the change ""good news."" ""It is my understanding that we will hear official news from the FAA in the coming days and coming weeks, and until such time we won't have any definitive guidance on whether or not our towers will face closure,"" Cordes said. Said Dickerson, ""Quite frankly, I don't think it changes the outcome. I think they'll still be closing all these towers. It just may be on a different schedule."" While the FAA has said it may have to close more than 100 control towers, it has given few specifics. It has released a list of towers on a list of potential closings, targeting those with fewer than 150,000 aircraft operations (take-offs and landings) or 10,000 commercial operations a year. Tower closures would not necessarily result in airport closures, because some aircraft can land without ATC help, and those that need controller help can communicate with more distant FAA facilities. Contract controllers are a widely used but little-known part of the FAA's air traffic control system. About 250 of the nation's 374 towers are staffed by contactors, though they must meet FAA standards and are overseen by FAA managers. Restricted to lower-volume airports, contract towers nonetheless handle 28 percent of all domestic airport operations. A 2011 report by the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General said contract towers cost on average $537,000 a year to operate, compared to $2 million for comparably busy FAA-staffed towers. The lower costs were chiefly due to lower staffing and salary levels at contract towers. Contract towers had an average of six controllers, while FAA towers had 16. And a typical contract controller near Tampa received a base pay of $56,000 per year compared to a base pay ranging from $63,000 to $85,000 a year for an FAA controller in Sarasota, Florida, the study said. Dickerson said contract towers are carrying the brunt of the cuts, despite having comparable safety records and being more cost efficient. But the forced government spending cuts, known as sequestration, are also impacting FAA staff. Most of the agency's 47,000 workers, including its 14,700 controllers, have been told to expect one- or two-furlough days every two-week pay period. And 49 FAA-staffed towers are on the list of those facing possible closure.","Series of calls held with contractors over the impact of budget cuts on control towers .
At issue are operations at 168 air traffic towers staffed by contractors .
Forced, government-wide budget cuts are expected to impact FAA services ."
