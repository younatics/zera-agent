"(CNN) -- The unlikely alchemy of a hard-rock legend and a bluegrass superstar created Grammy gold Sunday night, as Robert Plant and Alison Krauss picked up five awards -- including album and record of the year -- for their work, ""Raising Sand."" Alison Krauss and Robert Plant's song ""Please Read the Letter"" won record of the year. ""Sand"" won album of the year honor, while a song from the set, ""Please Read the Letter,"" won record of the year. ""I'm bewildered. In the old days we would have called this selling out. But it's a good way to spend a Sunday,"" said Plant, the legendary Led Zeppelin front man. ""Raising Sand"" was produced by T Bone Burnett, whose production and oversight of the ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" soundtrack won three awards -- including album of the year -- in 2002. For ""Sand,"" Burnett selected several songs, mostly obscurities such as Gene Clark's ""Polly Come Home"" and Sam Phillips' ""Sister Rosetta Goes Before Us,"" and let Plant and Krauss mix it up in stark, often subdued fashion. The result was widely praised and reached No. 2 on the album charts.  Watch Plant and Krauss talk about their win » . The win adds to Krauss' eye-popping Grammy total of 26 awards -- more than any female artist in history and third only to conductor Sir Georg Solti (31) and producer-arranger-mogul Quincy Jones (27). The awards were overshadowed by news that performer Chris Brown, who had been up for two Grammys, had become the focus of a domestic-violence allegation. Brown turned himself in to Los Angeles police Sunday evening.  Watch a report on the latest developments in the Brown case » .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of people aboard two cruise ships in the Caribbean fell ill due to norovirus, the latest instances in which the stomach bug has thwarted vacationers at sea. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Friday that norovirus had hit more than 600 passengers and crew on Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas, making it one of the biggest such outbreaks on any cruise ship in the last two decades. The vessel returned to port Wednesday, two days earlier than expected, and four days after the CDC began its investigation. ""No particular source has been identified, and it's quite possible a source won't be identified,"" the agency said. In addition, the Caribbean Princess, operated by Princess Cruises, cut short its own seven-day Caribbean itinerary on Friday. Princess Cruises said that 178 passengers and 11 crew members aboard had been stricken with norovirus, with CDC staffers on board Friday to help sanitize that ship. The cruise line's official reason for ending the trip early was not the norovirus outbreak, but rather a forecast of dense fog this weekend at the Houston port that was its final call. The report didn't sit well with some passengers, who spoke to CNN affiliate KHOU as they disembarked the ship Friday. Princess spokeswoman Julie Benson insisted that the prospect of fog making ship channels into the Houston port unnavigable was the only factor in turning the boat around. Keith Davis of Austin questioned the fog story. ""That's last Tuesday they tell us this, and they've never said anything different,"" he told KHOU. ""I knew then nobody can predict five days in advance. I knew that that wasn't the case. They were just doing that to minimize their damages."" What is norovirus? Bill and Linda Askins of West Columbia, 50 miles south of Houston, said they had a great time but were disappointed to turn back before the ship reached Belize. ""I'm still looking for the fog,"" Bill Askins told the station. ""It's a little irritating."" Linda Askins added, ""We were looking forward to (going to Belize). That's why we had taken the cruise, yes, but things happen. We understand."" Port of Houston Authority spokesman Bill Hensel said Princess was informed Tuesday that there was ""a high probability of a fog event"" this weekend. ImpactWeather, which bills itself as a ""full-time weather department for hundreds of companies around the globe,"" sent Princess a report Wednesday predicting dense fog setting in late Friday afternoon, Benson said. ""Breaks in the fog are not likely until the cold front moves offshore late Sunday morning or early Sunday afternoon. Thus, we are expecting that the ship channel will be closed for parts of Friday, all day Saturday, and Sunday through the afternoon hours,"" the report said. Princess, concerned the boat ""couldn't navigate the channel to get back to port,"" then made the decision to turn the boat around, Benson said. Asked if the ship would have continued on to Belize if the forecast had called for clear skies in Houston on Friday, she that was ""100% correct."" Are cruise ships floating petri dishes? The Caribbean Princess departed January 25 on its Western Caribbean tour with planned stops in Cozumel, Mexico, the Honduran island of Roatan and Belize, but threats of fog forced the ship to return home before it made it to Belize, Princess said in its statement. The cruise ship was carrying 3,104 passenger and 1,149 crew members. ""We truly regret having to make this change to our passengers' vacations, and we hope they understand that we did not have any choice but to return to Houston early before the unusually heavy fog closes the port,"" it said. Princess will provide hotels for those flying out of Houston, and passengers ""will receive a future cruise credit of 20% of their fare as well as one day per diem"" for meals and other expenses, the statement said. ""Approximately five passengers"" still had norovirus symptoms Friday, the cruise line said, describing it as ""a common but contagious illness which is widely circulating throughout North America."" The gastrointestinal illness causes vomiting and diarrhea, the CDC says. Sick passengers were asked to stay in their cabins while staff disinfected public areas such as restrooms and elevators. Several passengers told KHOU that crew members wearing gloves distributed hand sanitizer throughout the ship, and passengers weren't allowed to touch items like salt shakers, tongs and forks in the ship's common areas. Royal Caribbean cruise ship returns home - with a sickness record . Robert Fisher of Houston said he came down with an illness, but the symptoms passed after two days. Still, he said, the staff made him feel as if he were being incarcerated. ""I was tired of being held as a prisoner in the room,"" he said. ""They didn't bring food. They said they were bringing food. We had to call and remind them every time."" His cabin mate, Steve Juneau said, ""I would have to leave the room and go get him food."" He added that the staff worked diligently to keep the outbreak from spreading. ""They were trying really hard, but they were also very rude about it,"" Juneau told KHOU. Fisher said the 20% credit on a future cruise amounted to ""nothing"" when you consider he wasn't allowed to dine in the onboard restaurants and never saw Belize. Despite more than one of every 20 passengers being ill, many passengers reported seeing no sick people during the trip. Lloyd and Rosie Swayne of Grand, Texas, saw a passenger vomiting on the beach during one of the cruise's stops. ""They immediately removed her, cleaned the area, bleached the sand, everything. It was handled well,"" Lloyd Swayne told KHOU. CNN's Suzanne Presto, Dana Ford and Miriam Falco contributed to this report.","NEW: CDC confirms norovirus on Royal Caribbean ship that returned Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- 3-D printers are currently being used or explored by a multitude of industries -- from printing toys and automotive parts to meat and even houses. In medicine, they are already used to print prosthetic limbs and make patient-specific models of body parts that surgeons can use as guides during reconstructive surgery. It's no surprise, then, that scientists around the world are investigating whether living cells can be used to print replacement organs and tissues. 3-D printing is an exciting technology that I except to play a significant role as scientists expand their ability to engineer tissues and organs in the lab. What many people don't realize, however, is that the printer itself is not the ""magic"" ingredient for making lab-built organs a reality. Instead, printers are a vehicle for scaling up and automating a process that must begin at the laboratory bench. Before any organ can be engineered -- whether it's printed or built by hand -- there is much groundwork that must be accomplished. Vital to the process is a thorough understanding of cell biology. Scientists must determine not only what types of cells to use, but how to expand them in the lab and how to keep them alive and viable throughout the engineering process. Do they need to be imbedded in biocompatible material? If so, which biomaterial is most suitable? The bar for success is high -- the structures we engineer must function like native tissue. Interactive: How 3-D printing will reshape the world . Lab-built organs . Scientists on multiple teams have already demonstrated that lab-built organs can function quite well in patients. Engineered airways, bladders, blood vessels and urine tubes have been successfully implanted. What these structures have in common is that they are a combination of cells and biomaterials made in the shape of an organ or tissue. In our initial experience engineering tissues, we made these 3-D structures by hand. For example, by suturing a strip of biocompatible material into a tubular shape, we made scaffolds for urine tubes. With a pipette, cells were then added by hand to these structures. 3-D printers, on the other hand, offer the opportunity to very precisely combine cells and materials into the desired shape. The replacement tissue or organ can be designed on a computer using a patient's medical scans. The computer then controls the printer as it precisely prints the desired shape and determines cell placement. The printers we've designed give us the option of using two or more different cell types and placing them exactly where they need to be -- something not possible by hand. Read this: Regenerative medicine's promising future . 3-D printers also have the flexibility of using a variety of biomaterials so that cells can be printed in either gel-like or rigid scaffolds, or printed without scaffolds. In addition, structures can be printed without cells, as was the case of a printed airway splint developed by the University of Michigan that saved a young child's life. An ultimate goal of bioprinting, of course, is to be able to print complex structures such as kidneys that can help solve the shortage of organs available for transplant. While I believe this is achievable, there are many challenges to overcome before this is a reality. Oxygen supply . Any large organ structure -- regardless of how it is engineered -- is not like the fully functioning organ harvested from a donor. Instead, even when printed structures are made with living cells, they must ""incubate"" in the body to become fully functional. As the scaffold gradually degrades, the cells lay down new tissue -- resulting in a new organ. A major challenge in tissue engineering is to supply these structures with oxygen while they integrate with the body. One possibility is to print small channels into the structures that can be populated with blood vessel cells. Another option might be to print oxygen-producing materials into the scaffolds. While there are many challenges to solve, I believe the printing of complex organs will become reality, but not for decades. Other projects involving bioprinting are further along and closer to benefiting patients. For example, for the military-funded Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine, our team is working to print smaller tissues, such as bone and muscle, that would be used in facial reconstruction. We are also working to print skin cells directly onto burn wounds. But implantable tissue is not the only way 3-D printing can benefit patients. Our team and others are using 3-D printers to print miniature livers that have the potential to be used for drug testing. In addition, in collaboration with five other institutions, we are working to print miniature hearts, lungs, blood vessels and livers onto ""chips"" that will be connected with a blood substitute. Called a ""body on a chip,"" the system has the potential to speed up the development of new drugs because it could potentially replace testing in animals, which can be slow, expensive and not always accurate. Bioprinting is a rapidly developing field of science that obviously has many potential applications in medicine. Even five years from now, I suspect researchers will be pursuing potential treatments that are unimaginable today. It is important to remember, though, that the process involves more than putting cells in a cartridge and pressing ""print."" Developments that occur at the laboratory bench are an integral part of the equation and what can be accomplished with printing depends, in large part, on advancements in cell biology and materials science. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dr. Anthony Atala.","Scientists are trying to use living cells to print replacement organs and tissues .

"(CNN) -- The simple answer to the question why Pope Francis is headed to South Korea, in the first papal trip to Asia in 25 years, is straightforward. The pope is going to celebrate the sixth Asian Youth Day and beatify 124 martyrs of Korea. But the more complex answer has to take into consideration the Korean Catholic Church's unique history and the pope's theological agenda. These can give us a deeper understanding of why he is making this trip. While South Korea may not be viewed as an overtly Catholic nation (compared to the Philippines, the most Christian nation in Asia), at least 10% of South Korea's population belong to the Church, according to its statistics. The Catholic Church in Korea enjoys a high level of respect from non-Catholics, maintains good relations with other religious communities, and has a history of positive social engagement for the common good. Pope Francis's visit will recognize these accomplishments, a move that will not only please Koreans, but hold up their church as a model of evangelization. Evangelizing in Asia . Since it is Asia that has the greatest potential for the growth of Catholicism, it makes sense to highlight an Asian success story and to recognize the Asian youth who will be called on to continue that growth. Evangelization is in fact a key concern for Pope Francis. His apostolic exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium, focused on this topic and called for the transformation of the Catholic Church to focus on ""the evangelization of today's world rather than for her self-preservation."" The pope's concept of evangelization does not focus simply on baptizing new Catholics, but, as seen in the chapter from that exhortation entitled ""The Social Dimension of Evangelization,"" also includes a call for the inclusion of the ""homeless, the addicted, refugees, indigenous peoples, [and] the elderly who are increasingly isolated and abandoned."" Moreover, this pope, while recognizing the importance of ordained clergy, decried ""clericalism"" before the publication of this exhortation, sees the laity as having an active role in evangelization. The pope's concerns as expressed in Evengelii Gaudium therefore resonate with the historical accomplishments of the Korean Catholic Church in that it has grown into a relatively large and healthy Catholic community with much of the work of evangelization being conducted by the laity. It is no accident that during his trip the pope will visit Kkottongnae (Flower Village), a Catholic institution devoted to caring for such marginalized groups as the elderly and the homeless, where he will meet with leaders of the Apostolate of the Laity. Origins of Korean Catholic Church . The Korean Catholic Church began with the baptism of a Korean scholar named Yi Seung-hun in Beijing in 1784, who had developed an interest in Catholicism after reading Chinese books on the religion. After his baptism, Yi returned to Korea and began baptizing others, so that there were already 4,000 Catholics there before a missionary -- a Chinese priest named Father James Zhou Wen-mo, himself one of the martyrs to be beatified -- arrived in 1794. The Korean state could not tolerate the existence of a foreign religion whose members recognized a deity outside government control and persecuted the new church. Catholics were given the choice of giving up their religion or being sentenced to death, with several thousands choosing the latter and becoming martyrs. Despite these persecutions, the church managed to survive and rebuild itself multiple times. While foreign missionaries played an important role, much of the work of maintaining the community and spreading the faith was carried out by the laity. The coming of religious tolerance in the late 19th century led to an increase in the number of Catholics, but it was not until the 1960s that the Catholic Church in Korea began to grow quickly. While that growth has slowed down in recent years, the church is quite healthy, with its approximately five million members, according to the church. At the same time, it must be stressed that the Korean Catholic Church faces challenges. Growth has declined, and many newly baptized Catholics leave the faith or become lukewarm. Likewise, Korean society has many of the difficulties post-industrial societies in the West face, such as the ""unbridled consumerism"" the pope decried in his apostolic exhortation. It is here that one can see the importance of the martyrs who the pope will beatify. In their stories, one sees Catholics giving up wealth, sex, and even life itself out of their love for others and for God. The pope will no doubt highlight how their devotion to the faith led to the growth and development of the Catholic Community in Korea, allowing him to echo the themes found in his exhortation. The fact that he will beatify these martyrs in Korea the day after Koreans celebrate their independence from Japan, will not be missed by Koreans. The pope likely hopes that this recognition, and the teaching opportunity it provides, will renew evangelization in Korea, and through it, the world.","Pope is to celebrate sixth Asian Youth Day and beatify 124 martyrs of Korea .

"(CNN) -- Last weekend's release and the now imminent homecoming of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, held prisoner by the Taliban or its allies for nearly five years, are cause for celebration. Bergdahl was the only U.S. soldier being held in the Afghan war. The U.S. military does not abandon its own. Bergdahl's release is nonetheless controversial because of the price paid for it: our release of five former Taliban leaders from Guantanamo to Qatar, where, we are told, they will be monitored and barred from leaving that small Gulf Emirate for one year. There is no denying that the release of Taliban murderers was a stiff price to pay. Letting them go (albeit after a dozen years of incarceration at Guantanamo) was necessary, the administration says, because otherwise Sgt. Bergdahl's life was in danger. If Washington, knowing of an imminent threat to his life, had chosen simply to let one of our soldiers die, how would the American public react? Granted, the objections to this prisoner swap are not trivial. On balance, though, the administration made the right call. One objection is that the released Taliban prisoners, who have killed before, are likely to kill again, once they return to Afghanistan in one year (assuming they do not slip away from Qatar even sooner). That is possible -- but not a certainty. Both the Afghan and U.S. governments have been trying to encourage peace negotiations with the Taliban. Admittedly, a peace deal faces long odds. Still, there is a degree of speculation as to whether the Taliban prisoners -- after long years in Guantanamo away from their comrades -- will necessarily return to their old ways. In contrast, we are told -- on what classified basis we do not yet know -- that Bergdahl's life was in imminent danger, if the White House and Pentagon had refused to make the swap. And even if Bergdahl had survived, how many more years of incommunicado imprisonment would he have had to endure? With U.S. forces in Afghanistan set to wind down to only 10,000 by the end of 2014, and to leave the country altogether by the end of 2016, U.S. leverage to secure his release was steadily diminishing. Another objection is that the U.S., as a matter of policy, should never negotiate with terrorists. In general that is a sound policy. But the Taliban are not garden variety terrorists. They are an armed force with which the U.S. has been engaged in armed conflict for over a decade. Bergdahl was not a hostage held by ordinary terrorists. He was a soldier captured in war. The U.S. can make deals to secure the return of prisoners without relinquishing our general policy of not negotiating with terrorists. A further objection is that this deal will encourage the Taliban to capture more American soldiers. But the Taliban need no incentives to try to capture U.S. service members. Any chance they get, they will take -- regardless of how the U.S. dealt with the Bergdahl release. Finally, some Republicans in Congress object that the deal was illegal, because the administration is required by statute to give Congress 30 days notice before transferring prisoners from Guantanamo, but failed to do so. The administration counters that there was no time for delay without risking Bergdahl's life, and that in these circumstances, the President's constitutional powers as commander in chief entitled him to override the statute. Although the point is debatable as a matter of law, in my view the administration wins the argument. Aside from the prisoner swap for Bergdahl, there remains a larger question: Is the continued detention of 149 prisoners at Guantanamo (following the release of the five Taliban) in the national security interest of the United States? Sixty or so are Yemenis who have long been cleared for release, because they are deemed not to pose a threat to the U.S. The administration keeps them in Guantanamo only because of unrest in Yemen. Other prisoners are detained indefinitely, with no prospect for trial or release. Still other prisoners, who face criminal charges, are or will be tried by military commissions that fall short of minimum international standards of fair trial. Both as symbol and in substance, Guantanamo thus remains a gaping wound in U.S. credibility. When we criticize Russia or China for violating international law, each has a ready retort: The U.S. violates international law at Guantanamo. Even our allies see us as hypocrites. At a time when our ""hard power"" is in decline, in both absolute terms (a shrinking military) and relative terms (versus mounting Chinese power), Guantanamo undermines American ""soft power"" -- when we need it more than ever. Guantanamo has too long been treated as a domestic political football. It is past time to recognize that the price of continuing this game into overtime is too high.","Douglass Cassel: The objections to the Bergdahl deal raise serious issues .

"(CNN) -- More than 130 unmarked graves at a former convent discovered in Dublin in 1993 first brought to public consciousness the plight of thousands of women forced to work at Catholic-run workhouses in Ireland -- an ugly legacy that's the focus of a new report from the Irish government. The report, released Tuesday, acknowledges that Ireland's government sent thousands of women and girls to ""harsh and physically demanding"" workhouses known as Magdalen Laundries, where they worked and lived without pay, sometimes for years. The laundries operated from 1922 to 1996. ""The psychological impact on these girls was undoubtedly traumatic and lasting,"" the Irish government-backed investigatory committee found. The report also said, ""Many of the women who met with the committee -- and particularly those who entered the Magdalen Laundries as young girls -- experienced the Laundries as lonely and frightening places."" ""For too long, they have been and have felt forgotten. Indeed for many of them, an inability to share their story in the years after their time in a Magdalen Laundry has only added to the confusion and pain they feel about that period in their lives."" The committee highlighted the stigma attached to their plight, saying that ""the chronicle of the Magdalen Laundries was for many years characterised primarily by secrecy, silence and shame."" As a result, the women admitted there ""have for too long felt the social stigma of what was sometimes cruelly called the 'fallen woman.' This is a wholly inaccurate characterisation, hurtful to them and their families, that is not borne out by the facts."" But contrary to survivors' testimony published by advocacy groups, the report did not find physical abuse or torture to be a feature of the laundries. It also found no evidence that women were sexually abused, but acknowledged that it had spoken to only a fraction of those concerned. The report's authors said the four orders of nuns who ran the laundries said they had kept many details quiet out of a desire to protect the women's privacy, and that they had sought to provide for the marginalized and disadvantaged, rather than profiting from the laundries. About 10,000 women worked in the so-called Magdalen, or Magdalene, Laundries over seven decades -- and more than a quarter of them were referred there by the state, for various reasons including by the courts as a condition of probation, according to the report. Others were unmarried mothers, victims of sexual abuse, orphans considered a burden to relatives or the state, or had mental or physical disabilities. Some were simply admitted by the families for reasons not known. Responding to its findings, Ireland's taoiseach, or prime minister, Enda Kenny said he was sorry for the stigma the women had suffered and the conditions they endured in the convent-run laundries. But he did not give the formal apology many of the women have called for. Survivors' groups say the women were physically and psychologically abused, denied an education and detained against their will -- and insist they are owed a formal government apology and compensation. With many now advanced in age, they also want the state to provide pensions for the years they worked without pay. For years, their situation was shrouded in mystery, with details coming to light only in the past two decades. The government-backed investigatory committee, chaired by Sen. Martin McAleese, was established in response to a call by the U.N. Committee Against Torture. Its findings will be debated by the Irish parliament later this month. It found ""evidence of direct State involvement"" in numerous aspects of the 10 laundries' operation. The report's authors spoke to about 100 women who had worked in the laundries between the foundation of the Irish state in 1922 and the closure of the last of the workhouses in 1996. About 60% of the women spent less than a year there, the committee found. Advocacy group Magdalene Survivors Together said the women concerned had been ""let down"" by the committee. One, Mary Smith, said: ""It was worse than any prison, and I'll never ever get over it. I'll go to my grave with this pain, it was soul destroying, and the pain will never leave me. ""The government and the religious should stand up and acknowledge what they did to us and the scars that they left, and the pain that will never ever go away."" Survivor testimony published by the Justice for Magdalenes campaign group also depicted the workhouses as harsh and exploitative places. ""In the Magdalene laundry, it was a well-known fact that once you went in there you never came out,"" one woman told the group. ""You couldn't walk out, because all the locks would be on the doors. You couldn't. Unless family of yours took you out. Say somebody claimed you, and took you out. Then that was the only way, or else you'd go out in a coffin, you know? You died there."" Those who escaped the convent walls have had no easy time either, the group said. In a 2011 submission to the U.N Committee Against Torture, Justice for Magdalenes highlighted the dire situation in which many of the survivors still find themselves, years later. ""Their poverty has been exacerbated throughout their lives by the denial of educational opportunity which they suffered while incarcerated in the laundries, as well as the psychological and physical injury caused by the abuse,"" it said. ""Nor have the women received healthcare or education to assist them in overcoming their trauma and abuse. ""There is a dearth of personal records of the women, and they continue to feel constrained and silenced by a deep sense of stigma and shame over their incarceration in the Magdalene Laundries, because of the continued denial of justice, lack of inquiry, and lack of acknowledgment that they were not at fault for what they suffered but instead had a grave abuse perpetrated upon them."" The lack of personal records has also made it difficult for the adopted children of those locked up in the laundries to trace their mothers. The last of the Magdalen Laundries closed in 1996. An act passed in 2002 addressed abuse and neglect suffered by thousands of Irish children in state-licensed residential homes and schools, but omitted those who'd suffered in the Magdalen Laundries.","About 10,000 women were sent to work in the Magdalen Laundries, a report finds .

"(CNN) -- A pipeline that sends natural gas to Jordan was set on fire in the Egyptian Sinai town of El Arish on Saturday, and the suspected act of sabotage has forced its temporary closing, officials said. Ghaleb Al Maabreh, head of Jordan's national electricity company, confirmed the closing. He said at least one week will be needed to fix it and the cost for the repair will be covered by Jordan. Al Maabreh said the government will start using alternative sources that will cost it $4.2 million daily. It is able to provide itself with energy sources for the coming three weeks, he added. Unless the pipe is repaired quickly, it could become a big problem for Jordan, a country already spending heavily in fuel subsidies, a Jordanian senior official said. As a precaution as it responds to the incident, Egypt's gas company decided to stop pumping gas in the area altogether, including gas going to neighboring Israel. Israel has been getting supplies from a location 20 kilometers away from the damaged gas pipeline in El Arish. Israel is still getting natural gas from another source, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who conferred with a Cabinet minister and security officials, said the country is prepared to immediately use alternative sources of energy supplies. Egyptian state-run Nile TV described the damaged line as ""one of the main gas pipelines"" there. The state-run MENA news agency said it was a suspected terrorist attack. The governor of Sinai told Nile TV that the flames were under control and firefighters were working to extinguish the blaze. He called the fire a sabotage attempt . However, it is not clear whether the incident is connected to the political unrest in Egypt or even the Palestinian territories. Hamas, the Palestinian movement that runs Gaza, issued a statement denied it had been involved in any attack on the station. On Friday, a government official told CNN a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at state security headquarters in El Arish. The official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak about the incident, said the strike caused a fire but there were no casualties.

"Ajdabiya, Libya (CNN) -- The Libyan military bombed two key towns in the east again Thursday, stepping up efforts to reclaim a region lost to rebels. The aircraft targeted al-Brega and Ajdabiya, both of which were hit with bombs Wednesday. Opposition forces told CNN they were forging ahead, working to maintain their positions and fend off attacks by pro-Gadhafi forces. Rebels have armed themselves in some cases by raiding military installations and police stations. Morale on the part of the opposition seems to be high, while morale among Gadhafi's forces -- which have seen defections as some members of the military have joined the protests -- seems low, CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from eastern Libya. Libyan jets Thursday dropped two bombs over al-Brega -- one near a military checkpoint and one near the main gate to a refinery, witnesses reported. In Ajdabiya,a tribal leader said the military dropped two bombs on military camps. Witnesses told CNN one bomb was near an ammunition depot. The situation in Libya is different from those in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt, where uprisings turned into revolutions that overthrew their rulers. Libya is facing a battle between government forces and rebel forces. ""This is becoming a war,"" Wedeman tweeted. The more Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi uses aerial attacks, the more pressing discussions become in the West about imposing a no-fly zone over the country. U.S. military and diplomatic officials -- including Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Michael Mullen and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- have all said enacting a no-fly zone is complicated and risky, and international support for the idea is not there yet. ""If it's ordered, we can do it,"" Gates said, but imposing a no-fly zone ""begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses."" Libya's deputy U.N. ambassador, Ibrahim al-Dabashi, appealed to the United Nations to impose a no-fly zone over the country after he broke with Gadhafi's regime and expressed support for the protesters more than a week ago. U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday the United States is examining a ""full range of options"" in the Libyan crisis.  There is a danger of a ""bloody stalemate"" in Libya, he said, adding that he wants to be sure the United States ""has the capacity to act quickly in event of humanitarian crisis."" ""Col. Gadhafi needs to step down from power and leave,"" Obama said.  ""It's the right thing to do.""   The president also warned that advisers to Gadhafi need to understand that they will be held accountable for any violence they perpetrate against civilians.  ""They should know history is moving against Col. Gadhafi,"" Obama said. The Arab League Wednesday rejected foreign intervention, saying Libya is facing ""an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments."" But the league cannot ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue, said Hisham Yousef, chief of staff of the Arab League. Gadhafi's regime Thursday sought to create an impression that it still controls the vast majority of the country, with rebels in charge of only pockets. The government organized a trip for a CNN crew to visit a refinery in Zawiya controlled by the government. Rebels control the center of the city, but the refinery is on the outskirts. The refinery, Libya's second largest, is operating at 80% of its capacity, officials told CNN's Nic Robertson. Managers said that while the refinery had not come under attack, some staff members had been unable to get to work. Protesters calling for the ouster of longtime leader Gadhafi have taken to the streets for a third week amid clashes with government forces. He has been in power for nearly 42 years. Musa Ibrahim, a spokesman for Gadhafi's regime, told CNN, ""We need tribal intervention, social intervention to help us convince these people to come to the negotiating table."" The government spokesman denied any attacks on peaceful protesters despite numerous reports from the country of unarmed demonstrators being shot indiscriminately. More than 1,000 people are reported to have been killed and many more injured during the protests, according to the United Nations. Libya's ambassador to the United States has estimated that the death toll was about 2,000. The International Criminal Court Thursday said Gadhafi and some of his sons and advisers are under investigation for alleged crimes against humanity. ""I would like to use this opportunity to put them on notice,"" ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo told CNN. ""I want to be clear: If their troops commit crimes, they could be made criminally responsible."" It is the first time the court will be investigating claims as they are allegedly occurring. Libya is not a signatory to the Rome Statute, which created the ICC, and does not recognize the authority of the international court. But the United Nations Security Council referred the matter to the court, essentially giving it ""jurisdiction"" over the situation in Libya, the court said. Nations have scrambled to evacuate hundreds of citizens as the unrest continues. The Netherlands defense ministry said Thursday that three Dutch navy personnel were captured by armed men loyal to Gadhafi during an evacuation operation Sunday. The ministry did not release information earlier because of safety reasons. Libyan state TV said the personnel were in a fighter helicopter and did not have permission from Libyan authorities to enter.  The state TV report showed pictures of those believed to be the crew, as well as the helicopter and images of weapons. The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya's borders into Egypt and Tunisia, and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders. Obama said he approved the use of U.S. military aircraft to help return to Egypt those Egyptian citizens who have fled to Tunisia to escape the unrest in Libya.  Obama said he has also authorized the U.S. Agency for International Development to charter civilian aircraft to help people from other countries get back home.

"(CNN) -- When it comes to deciding where the money goes, the Lotus Formula One team says its main priority is the car -- not the star driver who sits in the cockpit. Kimi Raikkonen said last week that he decided to leave it and rejoin Ferrari for the 2014 season because Lotus ""haven't got my salary."" But the team, owned by Luxembourg-based investment group Genii Capital, has now responded by explaining that it prefers to focus its finances on developing the car, even if it means seeing their driving talent walk away. Raikkonen has posted Lotus' only victory this year, with himself and the team both fourth in the respective driver and constructor standings. ""Our suppliers and key people who develop the car were our priority -- maybe not Kimi,"" Lotus team principal Eric Boullier told the official F1 website. ""Kimi was in a similar position last year and it was all settled by the end of the year. And Genii had the plan to do the same this year. ""It is public knowledge by now that we've been late in paying him, and he got upset. ""To manage the cash flow -- and I don't mean the money itself or the budget we have, which is guaranteed by Genii, or at least most of it as we don't have the revenue stream to allow us to live independently from Genii -- this cash flow is an issue if you have fixed costs and want to keep up the development level. ""You have to decide where you want to spend your money."" Genii Capital took full control of the team -- which has raced in F1 since 1981 under its previous guises Toleman, Benetton and Renault -- from previous owner Renault in 2011. Ownership by a private investment company, instead of car manufacturers such as Mercedes and Fiat, which owns Ferrari, or a global company such as Red Bull, can provide a more risky financial backdrop for an F1 team. But Boullier says that Lotus' alternative business model does not mean it is mired in a financial crisis, as the rumors circulating in the sport would suggest. ""Red Bull or Mercedes, those companies are sponsoring the teams,"" said Boullier, whose driver management company Gravity also has connections to Genii. ""Genii has a different strategy: they loan the money. ""It is part of the strategy that partners join the team and Genii will get back their investment. ""Seventy-five percent of the debt Lotus has comes from Genii. They could write it off tomorrow by saying this money is a sponsorship -- and then our debt would be drastically reduced. Our normal debt is similar to most of the other teams."" Genii's strategy of choosing to bankroll the team before looking for sponsorship deals to recoup their investment is a gamble. Having 2007 world champion Raikkonen on board would have inevitably helped attract sponsors, but now Boullier is looking at alternatives. He says the team plans to emulate the business strategy of some of rivals, including Red Bull and McLaren, by looking for a title sponsor. ""It is no secret that for quite a while Genii have been looking for partners to make sure that we can bring more money to the team and have access to a bigger sponsor portfolio,"" the Frenchman added. ""We need to secure sponsors, as this is the only way to step up. ""Formula One depends massively on the people -- and to attract the best people to a team you need to have money, to be able to build something for the long term. ""Genii's plan was to bring the team up within five years -- which we are trying to do -- but to move to the next step you need another five-year plan in place. And that is what we are working on.""","The Lotus Formula One team says it prioritizes spending on developing the car .

"Washington (CNN) -- South Carolina political operatives say Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham deftly figured out how to duck, dodge and parry the kinds of conservative challenges that have bedeviled some fellow party incumbents this primary season. The strategy seemed twofold: Make friends in enemy camps and wield a big war chest. To accomplish the first part, he made strategic alliances with the tea party-backed newcomers in his congressional delegation who could have posed a political threat. Those lawmakers include people such as Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former state attorney and U.S. attorney. Conservatives in the Palmetto State had hoped Gowdy would challenge the state's senior senator. When conservative radio host Laura Ingraham asked Gowdy in July whether he would consider challenging Graham, the answer was a quick no. Graham's alliances paid off Tuesday in South Carolina's primary. He easily topped the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff. Graham's opposition was fractured heading into the primary. State Sen. Lee Bright came in a distant second, followed by five other challengers who all registered in the single digits. Gowdy told CNN last week he had worked with Graham on several issues, ranging from debt reduction to Benghazi. Graham and Gowdy, along with two other South Carolina congressional delegation members, Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Mick Mulvaney, helped take the lead in sponsoring legislation this year that would allow states to opt out of the individual and employer mandate portions of Obamacare. Both Graham and Gowdy have also been deeply critical of the Obama administration's handling of the deadly attacks on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 that left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Gowdy is chairman of a newly established House committee charged with investigating those attacks. Then there's Graham's massive war chest -- $9.4 million, a figure that far eclipses what his six opponents have been able to raise, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit organization which analyzes the influence of money in politics. He's used that money to target conservative strongholds and airwaves with ads, state political analysts said. ""Graham stockpiled millions of dollars and probably forced potential challengers to really wrestle with whether it was worth it to give up whatever office they might currently hold to take him on,"" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. ""That might have kept some top-tier challengers on the sidelines."" Not too shabby for a lawmaker who is reviled in some conservative Republican circles for his support of immigration reform, and prior willingness to discuss climate change and gun policy reform. Several county party chapters censured the lawmaker for working with Democrats, and for what they see as failure to uphold conservative values, said Dave Woodard, a political science professor at Clemson University who co-wrote a book on free speech with former Sen. Jim DeMint. ""Lindsey Graham took this seriously. He knew how critical the primary was against him and he began working on it,"" said Woodard who is also a former GOP consultant for DeMint, Graham, Gowdy and several other South Carolina members of Congress. ""He had seen some incumbent Republicans get beaten in primaries, and so he was well armed."" According to the New York Times, Graham was raised in the town of Central, South Carolina, the son of a pool hall owner, and only managed a combined score of 800 on his SATs. But he earned undergraduate and law degrees from the University of South Carolina, and has been an Air Force lawyer and a member of the U.S. House. He is known as a quick study, political analysts said. Take for example his positioning on climate change. In 2009, he co-sponsored a letter, along with then Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, and Sen. Joe Lieberman, then a Democrat from Connecticut, detailing support for climate change legislation. Conservatives in South Carolina were outraged. Just a year later, Graham told the media that he questioned what he sees as an alarmist approach to climate change. ""The science about global warming has changed,"" he said. Graham's shifts are a strategic appeal to conservatives in his state, political analysts said. Hogan Gidley, a GOP consultant and a former executive director of the state party, told CNN that Graham succeeded in ""tethering himself"" to Scott, a favorite of the right, ""touting his conservative credentials in commercials, and basically telling voters that at the end of the day he's a conservative."" CNN Political Editor Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Sen. Lindsey Graham has carefully evaded conservative attacks, political analysts say .

"(CNN) -- Word of Nelson Mandela's death spread quickly across the United States, bringing with it a mix of reverence and grief for a man who was born in South Africa but in the end belonged to the world. President Barack Obama ordered American flags to be lowered immediately to half-staff until Monday in tribute to Mandela, a rare honor for a foreign leader. Memorials to the former South African president popped up from Los Angeles to Chicago, where flowers and candles were laid in front of murals bearing his likeness. In Washington, people gathered in front of South Africa's embassy. For many Americans, the death of Mandela was akin to losing one of their own. He loomed large in the actions of activists and politicians; he inspired music and movies. Here's a look at Mandela's impact on the United States: . ACTIVISM . It began with a financial boycott, of sorts. Students on campuses across the country in the late 1970s called for their universities and colleges to divest from investments in South Africa. That led to sit-ins and protest marches that by the mid-1980s drew thousands. ""We had marches day after day, thousands of people got arrested in Washington, D.C.,"" civil rights attorney Charles Ogletree said. ""They were all released and ultimately not charged with any offense. Because it was a national issue -- black, white, male, female, people on the left and right, everybody was involved in it."" In 1986, Rep. Ron Dellums, D-California, sponsored a bill that called for a full trade embargo against South Africa as well as divestment by American companies. The bill, which passed the House, was vetoed by then-President Ronald Reagan. Congress then overrode the veto. Today, this type of activism -- financial boycotts -- have become a protest staple. For example, fast food workers called this week for a boycott of their respective restaurants to protest low wages. Nelson Mandela: 10 surprising facts you probably didn't know . POPULAR CULTURE . It began in 1985 with musician Steven Van Zandt's ""Sun City,"" a song that protested the South African policy of apartheid. The music brought together such musical powerhouses as Bruce Springsteen, Run DMC, Bonnie Raitt, Miles Davis, George Clinton, Jackson Browne and dozens more to record the single and video. That was followed in 1986 with the release of Paul Simon's ""Graceland,"" which featured South African musicians -- including Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Simon on Thursday praised Mandela as one of the world's greatest teachers. ""He conceived a model for mortal enemies to overcome their hatred and find a way through compassion to rebuild a nation based on truth, justice and the power of forgiveness,"" the singer said in a statement to CNN. ""His passing should reignite a worldwide effort for peace."" On Thursday, the famed Apollo Theater in Harlem -- that hosted so many of these artists -- paid tribute to Mandela. Its marquee said, simply: ""He changed our world."" Hollywood was a long-time supporter of Mandela's fight against apartheid, releasing a number of movies inspired by the civil rights leader's plight. ""We count ourselves unspeakably fortunate to have been immersed in Nelson Mandela's story and legacy,"" said Harvey Weinstein, whose company is releasing the biopic ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom"" this month. A number of Hollywood heavyweights have portrayed Mandela, including Danny Glover, Sidney Poitier and Terrance Howard. Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for best actor for his portrayal of Mandela in ""Invictus."" The latest to step into the role is Idris Elba, who plays the South African leader in ""Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom."" ""What an honor it was to step into the shoes of Nelson Mandela and portray a man who defied odds, broke down barriers, and championed human rights before the eyes of the world,"" Elba said. How one British pop song helped to free Nelson Mandela . POLITICS . Perhaps nowhere is Mandela's influence more evident that on America's politicians. As a student at the University of California, Berkeley, California Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner participated in the divestment protests in the late 1970s and early 1980s. So when Mandela was released and the South African government began its transition, ""I think we felt like were part of that,"" Skinner said. She learned of Mandela's death during a Democratic caucus in California. ""That strategic, spiritual, political leadership has no equal,"" she said. President Obama recounted to the nation on Thursday how he drew inspiration from Mandela during his first public speech. ""My very first political action, the first thing I ever did that involved an issue or a policy or politics, was a protest against apartheid. I studied his words and his writings,"" he said in a televised address shortly after Mandela's death was announced. ""And like so many around the globe, I cannot fully imagine my own life without the example that Nelson Mandela set, and so long as I live I will do what I can to learn from him."" ""He no longer belongs to us,"" Obama said. ""He belongs to the ages."" Nelson Mandela: A man of many handshakes .

"(CNN) -- Tuesday brought a shocking result -- at least for Americans -- from the snowboard halfpipe, a magnanimous gesture from one country to another, and just another, ho hum, two gold medals for Norway in its favorite event. Bad Things for Shaun White . Was it the condition of the halfpipe? Was it the haircut? Or was it that some days you just get beat? The big newsmaker in the men's halfpipe was the guy who finished fourth (which might be the worst place to finish if you make it to the Olympic Games). Many Americans were crushed when they found out Shaun White not only didn't win, he didn't even get a medal. He seemed pretty disappointed himself. ""I had a game plan, I had a specific run I wanted to land and I didn't get to put it down and that's one of the most frustrating things,"" he said of his mistakes. ""If I get to land my run and I get beat I'm OK with that, but it didn't work out that way."" But don't pronounce the king dead just yet, he warned. Those tricks he was landing in practice, ones that he didn't get to break out, they will ""carry on for the next few years."" White, 27, may be an old man among snowboarders, but he's giving every indication he'll be back for 2018. For now, it's time for Bad Things. We're not referring to his results at Sochi. We're referring to the band for which he plays guitar. He said it will be a nice break from competition. Historic day for American women . Sarah Hendrickson didn't medal in the women's ski jump, but she made history that can't be taken away. Years from now, she can brag that she was the first woman to ever ski jump in the Olympics. Tuesday didn't go the way she planned; the 19-year-old, who was a pre-event favorite despite a knee injury, finished 21st. After the event, she tweeted again, saying: ""Ya I didn't win a medal ... you can judge me all you want but you'll never know how hard I worked to jump compete today as an Olympian."" Trust me, we're not judging. Ski jumping takes equal parts crazy, determination and unreal athleticism. Obviously at 19 she'll have a chance to see several more Olympics. She and the other female jumpers want to compete in a large hill and team event at the 2018 Games in South Korea just like the men. We're thinking they'll get their shot. Over at the luge track, Erin Hamlin slid into what is traditionally a Germans-only victory celebration and earned a bronze medal. It was the first medal for an American woman in singles. ""Luge isn't the biggest sport at home and we've never won an individual medal. Hopefully this gives it a boost. I'm happy to pave the way to the future,"" she said. Canadian coach lends a hand, er, ski . Anton Gafarov of Russia was struggling. He was well out of contention in the cross-country sprint event after two crashes. During the first he broke a ski. During the second it snapped to the point it was unusable. Still he was trying to complete the race, despite being almost three minutes behind in an event that takes just longer than that time frame. That's when an opponent's coach trucked out on the course with a spare ski. ""I wanted him to have dignity as he crossed the finish line,"" Canadian Justin Wadsworth told the Toronto Star. He was baffled as to why the Star even wanted to talk to him about the incident. Any coach would do something like that, he said. But that's just it, none of the other coaches, not even the Russians, made a move. Medal marvels . A lot of the sports at the Winter Olympics are dominated by one nation. Speed skating -- the Dutch. Luge -- the Germans. Snowboarding -- the United States, well, most of the time. But no one has taken home as much hardware as Norway, a country of 5 million, has in cross-country skiing. They've won 38 gold medals, the most top finishes in any Winter Olympics sport. They added to the total Tuesday when Ola Vigen Hattestad and Maiken Caspersen Falla won the sprint events. It makes sense that Norway is so good at the sport. According to the Olympic News Service, in or about the year 1200, King Sverre of Norway was the first to have his troops use skis in battle. He ordered his scouts to use them to spy during the Bagler War. The first timed race was held in Norway in the 19th century. OK, enough of the history lessons. Norway now tops the overall medals table with 11, six from cross-country skiing. Letter for Jamie . We could all use a fan letter like this. Jamie Anderson, who won the first women's slopestyle snowboard event, received a ""precious letter"" from Leanne, who is lives in San Jose, California, and is in second grade. Bleacher Report says USA Today reporter Mike Foss noticed the letter posted to Anderson's Twitter account. Foss writes that the letter is beyond cute -- it's adorable. Leanne even interspersed different colored stars into a cheering letter that reads: . Dear Jamie Anderson, . I'm so proud you made the Olyimpic (remember, she's in second grade) team! I've been reading about you and you are really amazing! I learned that you like biking. I like biking, too. I hope you go high and do lots of tricks and do a really good job and do a nice job on the USA team. You are really good at Slopestyle Snowboarding. Rub the penny to get good luck. Sincerely, . Leanne . And Leanne taped a penny to the letter. Someone needs to get Leanne her own gold medal.","Shaun White puts down the snowboard, picks up his guitar .

"(CNN) -- Sunday's Teen Choice Awards found no fault with ""The Fault In Our Stars."" The June movie release was a big winner at the 2014 ceremony, beating out ""American Hustle,"" ""Heaven Is For Real,"" ""Million Dollar Arm"" and ""Veronica Mars"" for the choice movie drama surfboard trophy. ""Fault"" stars Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort also walked away with a huge surfboard haul, winning the Teen Choice Awards for movie drama actress (Woodley), movie drama actor (Elgort), and for movie liplock. Their co-star Nat Wolff got a surfboard of his own for choice movie scene-stealer, and he shared yet another surfboard with Woodley and Elgort for choice movie chemistry. Film was far from the only category of the night, as the awards ceremony honored teen favorites in movies, TV, music and on the Web. Here's what else you should know about the 2014 Teen Choice Awards: . 1. Donald Sutherland remains the best . ""Hunger Games"" actor Donald Sutherland won the Teen Choice Award for best movie villain, and he arrived on stage to show exactly why. ""You voted me most villainous?"" Sutherland, who plays the calculating President Snow in the ""Hunger Games"" series, asked the roaring crowd. ""I've been married for 42 years. My wife asked me to tell you that she agreed with you. I, on the other hand, do not. I think, on the contrary, that I am very nice. Sweet-tempered, and generous."" So generous, Sutherland continued, that he'd even brought the crowd ""souvenirs"" from the ""Hunger Games'"" Panem. And with that, he opened a bag to toss out berries at the audience -- which in the ""Hunger Games"" world tend to be poisonous -- with the warning, ""I wouldn't eat them if I were you."" 2. Selena Gomez gets personal . When Selena Gomez accepted her surfboard for the ultimate choice award -- a top prize that in the past has gone out to stars like Justin Timberlake, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Britney Spears -- she surprised the audience with an unexpectedly emotional speech. ""I have to be honest, especially this month, I have to thank you guys, because you remind me -- amidst the stuff that we deal with personally -- you remind me of what's important,"" Gomez said to her fans. ""And that's giving, and loving and caring about each other. I'm not trying to preach ... it's just that you guys make me better."" There was one more thing, Gomez continued: ""I want to thank my mom so much, because she's the greatest human being in the world,"" Gomez said. ""She's strong, and she's given up her life for me, and she's so beautiful. I want all of you to love your mom and give her everything, because she's incredible."" 3. Ansel Elgort is a breakout star . On top of the other honors 20-year-old Elgort won on Sunday, the actor also snagged the choice movie breakout star surfboard. ""The Fault In Our Stars,"" adapted from John Green's novel about a pair of teen cancer patients who fall in love, is just Elgort's third credited movie role, following 2014's other hit, ""Divergent."" If you don't know the actor's name yet, the Teen Choice Awards is telling you to get used to it. 4. The Kardashians still have a young audience . With E!'s ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" now in its ninth season, you might assume that teens in 2014 would be more interested in watching the newest Vine star than the Kardashian family's escapades. But in reality, they're watching both. On Sunday, Kim Kardashian joined her younger sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner to accept the surfboard for choice reality show, trumping ""Total Divas,"" ""The Real Husbands of Hollywood,"" ""Dance Moms"" and ""Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey."" Also on the TV side, ABC Family's ""Pretty Little Liars"" and The CW's ""The Vampire Diaries"" were two of the other big winners. ""Pretty Little Liars"" won choice TV drama as well as some acting awards for its cast, while ""Vampire Diaries"" won best sci-fi/fantasy TV series and a few surfboards for leads like Nina Dobrev and Ian Somerhalder. (For choice comedy, it was ""The Big Bang Theory"" all the way.) 5. ""Divergent"" and ""The Hunger Games"" are still loved, too . You might think after looking at the movie winners that ""The Fault In Our Stars"" has replaced franchises like ""Divergent"" and ""The Hunger Games"" in the hearts of teens, but those two movies were able to land a few wins, as well. ""Divergent,"" which also stars ""Fault"" actress Shailene Woodley, picked up the choice action movie title, while Woodley was named choice action movie actress as well. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"" the second movie in the four-film ""Hunger Games"" franchise, won the choice sci-fi/fantasy movie category and snagged a surfboard for star Jennifer Lawrence, who was named choice sci-fi/fantasy movie actress.","""The Fault In Our Stars"" was a big winner at the 2014 Teen Choice Awards .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Gunman opened fire at the base of one of Pakistan's highest peaks, killing 11 people, including 10 tourists and a local guide, sources from the country's foreign ministry said Monday. The attack took place at the base of Nanga Parbat between midnight and 1 a.m. on Sunday, according to senior police official Ali Sher. Among the victims were tourists from China, Ukraine and Slovakia, who had come to Pakistan to climb, he said. ""This was not a big hotel, just a small log/hut type lodge, so no major security,"" Sher said. Talking about the same attack earlier, authorities had said that gunman burst into a hotel, killing either nine or 10 foreigners. They said the death toll changed due to difficult communications and the area's remote location. The victims were: three Ukranians, two Slovakians, two Chinese, one Lithuanian, one Chinese-American, one Nepali, and one Pakistani guide. ""The attackers abducted two local guides and demanded they take them to where some foreigners are staying to carry out the attack,"" Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told parliament on Sunday. ""One (guide) was then killed, another escaped and has been detained by police for questioning."" Why some travelers seek out the world's most dangerous locales . The tourists had no security escort, the minister said. A spokesman for Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan said an affiliated group carried out the attack. The Pakistan Taliban targeted the foreigners because the international community supports drone strikes, said spokesman Ihsanullah Ihsan. The attack was also to avenge the killing of Emir Wali-ur-Rehman in a drone strike in Waziristan last month, the spokesman said. Rehman was the Pakistan Taliban's No. 2 leader. At least 14 killed in Pakistan mosque bombing . Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attack. He ordered an investigation and called for those responsible to be brought to justice. Saima Mohsin reported from Islamabad; Aliza Kassim reported from Atlanta. CNN's Zahir Shah Sheraz contributed to this report from Peshawar .","10 tourists and a Pakistani guide are killed, police say .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. ambassador to Islamabad was summoned to Pakistan's Foreign Ministry on Saturday, a day after Pakistan Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed by a U.S. drone strike. Foreign Ministry spokesman Aizaz Ahmed Chaudhry did not explain why the envoy was summoned. A U.S. State Department official confirmed the meeting to CNN but would not disclose details about it. The State Department official would not discuss U.S. operations in Pakistan but stressed the Pakistan Taliban's 2009 attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan and claims of responsibility for a failed attempt to bomb Times Square in New York. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and is not being named by CNN. Pakistan: Peace talks will go ahead . Pakistani Information Minister Pervez Rasheed insisted that Mehsud's death would not delay proposed peace talks between the government and the Pakistan Taliban, amid concern that anger about the strike might derail the process. Rasheed condemned the use of drones in Pakistan. ""Drones are used for killing, but they will not let the peace process be killed with it,"" the minister told reporters. Mehsud, who had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head for his alleged involvement in the 2009 attack , was killed in a drone strike in northwestern Pakistan on Friday, senior U.S. and Pakistani officials told CNN. He was buried overnight, though the body was burned beyond recognition, Taliban sources said. The organization was scheduled to meet Saturday to pick a new leader, the sources said. The Afghan Taliban condemned the drone strike as ""cowardly"" and ""barbaric"" in a statement posted on its website Saturday, the SITE intelligence group said. The statement urged the Pakistani government and people to take measures to stop the attacks. A new leader? No official announcement has yet been made on who will be the new chief for the Pakistan Taliban. But a number of names have emerged, as different factions and individuals jockey for position. Saleem Mehsud, a journalist who is close to the Mehsuds and familiar with the Pakistan Taliban, told CNN on Saturday that the central shura, or council, of the Pakistan Taliban has approved Sheheryar Mehsud as its new chief. Sheheryar Mehsud is from the Jangara area of South Waziristan and belongs to the Shabikheil sub-tribe within the larger Mehsud tribe, he said. That's the same sub-tribe that Baitullah Mehsud, who led the Pakistan Taliban before Hakimullah Mehsud, belonged to. Sheheryar Mehsud, who's 33 years old, has been involved in fighting in Kashmir and Afghanistan, he said. Pakistan braces for reprisals . There are fears the killing of Hakimullah Mehsud may spark a surge in violence. This is in part because the attack in Afghanistan in 2009 -- in which seven U.S. citizens died -- was launched in response to the strike that killed Baitullah Mehsud four months earlier. The Haqqani Network, designated by the United States as a terrorist organization, vowed to avenge Meshud's death. Spokesman Ahmed Yousaf said the group will launch attacks within a few days. The network is blamed for more than 1,000 U.S. casualties in Afghanistan. Security around Peshawar, the capital city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northwest Pakistan, is being beefed up as police and security brace for reprisal attacks, Home Secretary Akhtar Ali Shah said. ""Since this drone strike, we are waiting for a reaction,"" he said. ""We know the reaction will be strong. We have strengthened security in Peshawar, especially at the entry points in to the city. We have extra security on patrol with sniffer dogs."" Strike hit Taliban stronghold . Three other people were killed in Friday's strike, Pakistani intelligence sources and tribal officials said. They described the incident as a suspected U.S. drone strike in a remote area of Pakistan's North Waziristan region, a Taliban stronghold bordering Afghanistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. One missile hit a compound, and another struck a car nearby, the Pakistani sources said. This is not the first time Hakimullah Mehsud -- who took the reins of the Pakistan Taliban in 2009 -- has been reported killed after a drone strike. In February 2010, multiple sources said he had died after being hit in a drone strike in Pakistan a month earlier. But reports that he was alive surfaced in April of that year, and in May 2010 he appeared in a video in which he vowed attacks on major U.S. cities. The fact that senior Pakistani government officials have commented so quickly on the news of his death this time adds credence to the reports. Pakistan Taliban claimed Times Square plot . The Pakistan Taliban, which has long been conducting an insurgency against the Pakistani government, claimed responsibility for the December 2009 suicide bombing at the United States' Forward Operating Base Chapman in Khost, Afghanistan. Five CIA officers were among the seven U.S. citizens killed, and a member of Jordanian intelligence also died. The U.S. Justice Department charged Hakimullah Mehsud in the summer of 2010 for his alleged involvement in the attack, and U.S. officials offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. The group also claimed responsibility for a failed May 2010 attempt to detonate a car bomb in New York's Times Square. The following September, the U.S. State Department designated the Pakistan Taliban a foreign terrorist organization. Mehsud took over from Baitullah Mehsud, a fellow clan member, in 2009 after the latter was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Peace prospects . Hakimullah Mehsud's death could make progress in proposed peace talks between the Pakistani government and Pakistan Taliban more difficult. A relatively young and charismatic leader, he held together a disparate group with different tribal and other allegiances. There had reportedly been talks about him being involved in peace talks with Pakistan's government. His killing may upset some elements within the Pakistan Taliban if they believe that the Pakistani government was involved. The Pakistan Taliban could also pose an increased security threat if it splinters into smaller groups, which could be harder for security forces to detect. There has been a series of suicide bombings in the region over the past couple of years.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 10 members of Pakistan's military were killed in a gun battle with Taliban militants at a naval base in the coastal city of Karachi, authorities said Monday. The clashes raged for hours after attackers with guns and grenades stormed the compound Sunday night. By Monday afternoon, the base had ""been cleared from the terrorists,"" a Pakistani navy spokesman said. In addition to the 10 dead, at least 15 other Pakistani troops were wounded in the fighting, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said. Investigators have found the bodies of three attackers and believe a fourth is buried in debris, he said. They suspect two militants escaped, he said, citing witness reports. The Pakistani Taliban said the attack at the Mehran naval air station was to avenge the killing of innocent civilians. The group's spokesman, Ihsan Ullah, told CNN on Monday that Pakistani security forces are carrying out those killings on the instruction of the United States in the name of a ""war on terror."" One of the attackers had detonated a suicide jacket, Malik said, and another one was found wearing an undetonated jacket. ""We have daily 9/11 in this country. You see how we are suffering,"" he said. ""And therefore, this is my appeal to the international community ... trust us, trust us, because this is a time we need you to support us morally."" Authorities said militants wielding rocket launchers, automatic weapons and hand grenades attacked the base about 11 p.m. Sunday. They used ladders to scale a wall at the back of the base and jumped into the compound, Malik said. Two witnesses -- Amjad Bashir and Talha Hashmi -- reported at least 10 explosions in the subsequent hours. Each blast was typically followed by a sustained exchange of gunfire, Hashmi said. He said that several of the explosions -- thought to be the result of two military aircraft and a fuel tank catching fire and releasing plumes of smoke -- were particularly large. The attackers destroyed two P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft sold by the United States to Pakistan, Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan said. Six American contractors at the base during the attack moved to safety and were not injured, he said. The nation's military personnel responded with what an Malik called a ""major operation"" at the base, which is about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Karachi's main airport. According to the Pakistani navy's website, the Mehran base ""is efficiently supporting day and night operational activities of all (naval aviation) squadrons."" A host of courses are also offered on its grounds, from helicopter and air navigation instruction to sea survival. The Pakistani Taliban represents a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based. The group, which is headquartered in Quetta, is separate from the Afghan Taliban, which has been focused on re-establishing the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan. Both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda. Karachi, which is considered the main commercial hub of Pakistan, has seen a drastic increase in political, ethnic and religious violence in recent months. Just over three weeks ago, three people were killed and at least 20 were injured when a hand grenade exploded at a gambling club in the southern Pakistani city. The grenade was tossed into the club by one of two unidentified people riding past the facility on a motorbike, according to Javed Baloch, a senior police official in Karachi. The Taliban said it was behind an April 28 roadside bombing on a main road through Karachi that left at least five dead and 10 injured. Two days earlier, three were killed and more than 30 wounded when remote-controlled bombs detonated near two buses carrying Pakistani navy officials. CNN's Tim Schwarz, Stan Grant, Nasir Habib, Greg Botelho, Jack Maddox, Aliza Kassim and Charley Keyes contributed to this report.","NEW: Pentagon spokesman: Two P-3C Orion aircraft are destroyed .

"(CNN) -- At least 10 people died in a two-hour gunbattle at an air base in northern Pakistan on Thursday, a spokesman for the nation's air force said. Militants dressed as airmen shot their way through a security post as personnel at Minhas Air Base in Kamra were eating a predawn meal in observance of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, said Capt. Tariq Mehmood, an air force spokesman. He said one security forces member and nine militants were killed. Security personnel continued to look for the attackers after the gunfight and found one of the dead gunmen was wearing a suicide vest. Four airmen were wounded in the attack. There was no damage to aircraft, Mehmood said. Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan told CNN that the Pakistani Taliban carried out Thursday morning's attack at the base, about 37 miles northwest of the nation's capital of Islamabad. ""Today's attack was planned for two months and carried out by our mujahedeen,"" Ehsan said by phone. The Taliban official said three Pakistani soldiers were killed and an aircraft was destroyed, but the air force denies that claim. Ehsan said the attack was a warning to the Pakistani military to end its cooperation with Washington and its support for the U.S.-led occupation of Afghanistan. The attack came amid growing speculation that the Pakistani military is considering a U.S. demand to launch a major offensive targeting militants in the North Waziristan, a district in Pakistan's tribal region regarded as a haven for militants fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan. Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf condemned what he called an ""act of terrorism"" and praised airmen for their ""bravery"" as they ""successfully"" cleared the base of militants.

"(CNN) -- We've finally emerged from the season in which Americans were asked by the pollsters and politicians: ""Are you better off today than you were four years ago?"" But sometimes it's important to contemplate the question of progress from a longer view: How are we doing on the scale of a generation? To answer that question, take this brief quiz. Over the past two decades, what have the U.S. trends been for the following important measures of social health: high school dropout rates, college enrollment, juvenile crime, drunken driving, traffic deaths, infant mortality, life expectancy, per capita gasoline consumption, workplace injuries, air pollution, divorce, male-female wage equality, charitable giving, voter turnout, per capita GDP and teen pregnancy? The answer for all of them is the same: The trend is positive. Almost all those varied metrics of social wellness have improved by more than 20% over the past two decades. And that's not counting the myriad small wonders of modern medicine that have improved our quality of life as well as our longevity: the anti-depressants and insulin pumps and quadruple bypasses. Americans enjoy longer, healthier lives in more stable families and communities than we did 20 years ago. But other than the crime trends, these facts are rarely reported or shared via word-of-mouth channels. Idea of American exceptionalism a powerful force through history . Many Americans, for instance, are convinced that ""half of all marriages end in divorce,"" though that hasn't been the case since the early 1980s, when divorce rates peaked at just over 50%. Since then, they have declined by almost a third. This is not merely a story of success in advanced industrial countries. The quality-of-life and civic health trends in the developing world are even more dramatic. Even though the world's population has doubled over the past 50 years, the percentage living in poverty has declined by 50% over that period. Infant mortality and life expectancy have improved by more than 40% in Latin America since the early 1990s. No country in history has improved its average standard of living faster than China has over the past two decades. Of course, not all the arrows point in a positive direction, particularly after the past few years. The number of Americans living in poverty has increased over the past decade, after a long period of decline. Wealth inequality has returned to levels last seen in the roaring '20s. Today, the U.S. unemployment rate is still just under 8%, higher than its average over the past two decades. Household debt soared over the past 20 years, though it has dipped slightly thanks to the credit crunch of the last few years. And while the story of water and air pollution over that period is a triumphant one, the long-term trends for global warming remain bleak. We are much more likely to hear about these negative trends than the positive ones for two primary reasons. First, we tend to assume that innovation and progress come from big technology breakthroughs, from new gadgets and communications technologies, most of them created by the private sector. But the positive trends in our social health are coming from a more complex network of forces: from government intervention, public service announcements, demographic changes, the shared wisdom of life experiences passed along through generations and the positive effects of rising affluence. The emphasis on private sector progress is no accident; it is the specific outcome of the way public opinion is shaped within the current media landscape. Opinion: How progress is possible in Obama's second term . The public sector doesn't have billions of dollars to spend on marketing campaigns to trumpet its successes. A multinational corporation invents a slightly better detergent, and it will spend a legitimate fortune to alert the world that the product is now ""new and improved."" But no one takes out a prime-time ad campaign to tout the remarkable decrease in air pollution that we have seen over the past few decades, even thought that success story is far more important than a trivial improvement in laundry soap. That blind spot is compounded by the deeper lack of interest in stories of incremental progress. Curmudgeons, doomsayers, utopians and declinists all have an easier time getting our attention than opinion leaders who want to celebrate slow and steady improvement. The most striking example of this can be seen in the second half of the 1990s, a period in which both economic and social trends were decisively upbeat: The stock market was surging, but inequality was in fact on the decline; crime, drug use, welfare dependence, poverty -- all were trending in an encouraging direction. With a Democrat in the White House, you might assume that the op-ed pages of The Washington Post would be bursting with pride over the state of the nation, given the paper's center-left leanings. But you would be wrong. Over the course of 1997, in the middle of the greatest peacetime economic boom in U.S. history (and before the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke), 71% of all editorials published in the Post that expressed an opinion on some aspect of the country's current state focused on a negative trend. Less than 5% of the total number of editorials concentrated on a positive development. Even the boom years are a bummer. I suspect, in the long run, the media bias against incremental progress may be more damaging than any bias the media display toward the political left or right. The media are heavily biased toward extreme events, and they are slightly biased toward negative events -- though in their defense, that bias may just be a reflection of the human brain's propensity to focus more on negative information than positive, a trait extensively documented by neuroscience and psychology studies. The one positive social trend that did generate a significant amount of coverage -- the extraordinary drop in the U.S. crime rate since the mid-'90s -- seems to have been roundly ignored by the general public. The violent crime rate (crimes per thousand people) dropped from 51 to 15 between 1995 and 2010, truly one of the most inspiring stories of societal progress in our lifetime. And yet according to a series of Gallup polls conducted over the past 10 years, more than two-thirds of Americans believe that crime has been getting worse, year after year. Whether these biases come from media distortions or our human psychology, they result in two fundamental errors in the popular mind: We underestimate the amount of steady progress that continues around us, and we misunderstand where that progress comes from. We should celebrate these stories of progress, not so we can rest on our laurels but instead so we can inspire the next generation to build on that success. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steven Johnson.","Steven Johnson: By almost any measure, life in U.S. is much better than in past generations .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has authorized the release of dozens of prisoners seen as a security threat by the United States. A judiciary meeting chaired by Karzai decided Thursday to free 72 prisoners from Bagram prison after the presentation of a report from the Afghan spy agency saying there was no evidence against them, Karzai's office said in a statement. But the U.S. State Department disagreed with the decision. ""These 72 detainees are dangerous criminals against whom there is strong evidence linking them to terror-related crimes, including the use of improvised explosive devices, the largest killer of Afghan civilians,"" Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, said at a news conference Thursday. ""These insurgents, who pose threats to the safety and security of the Afghan people and the state, are being released without an investigation and without the use of criminal justice system in accordance with Afghan law,"" Psaki said. The prisoner release order comes amid broader tensions between Washington and Kabul over Karzai's current unwillingness to sign a bilateral security agreement to keep some U.S. and other coalition troops in Afghanistan after this year. Karzai has said he won't sign the deal until after the country's elections in April and until certain conditions are met, including an end to U.S. raids on Afghan homes and the release of Afghan prisoners from the Guantanamo Bay detention center. The judiciary meeting chaired Thursday by Karzai tasked the Afghanistan Criminal Cases Review Commission with releasing the 72 prisoners. It also asked the review commission to reassess the cases of the 16 other inmates in the prison against whom the spy agency says there is evidence. The planned release of the 72 prisoners ""undermines Afghanistan's court system and rule of law, because the Afghan people do not get their day in court,"" Psaki said Thursday. It's not the first time that Karzai's decision to release prisoners has upset the United States. The early and pre-trial release of prisoners by the Afghan government, at times at Karzai's hand, frustrated U.S. officials, diplomatic documents released in 2010 by WikiLeaks revealed. CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","The Afghan spy agency finds no evidence against 72 inmates of Bagram prison .

"(CNN) -- It was, said Novak Djokovic, the highest level of grand slam tennis he had ever been involved in, an unquestionable highlight of his career. No wonder after the Serb surpassed such luminaries as his head coach Boris Becker on the all-time list of grand slam winners with a seventh career title after edging Roger Federer for a second Wimbledon crown. ""It means a lot to me,"" Djokovic -- the newly crowned world No.1 -- told CNN after his 6-7 6-4 7-6 5-7 6-4 victory. ""No doubt this has been the highest level of a grand slam final that I was ever part of. ""I'm proud of the older achievements of my career. Before, the highlight of my career was the 2011 win at Wimbledon but this is even more special because of the fact I had lost five of the previous six grand slam finals. ""I've been through some tough moments privately and professionally."" In a pulsating final, neither player could be separated -- Djokovic seemingly in the ascendancy only to let slip a big advantage leading two sets to one and 5-2, before Federer broke back to force a fifth. But as two of the defining forces of men's tennis traded blows in a match complete with 143 winners, it was Djokovic who emerged triumphant, putting him on a par with John McEnroe and Mats Wilander on the list of all-time grand slam winners. A year ago, Andy Murray had blazed past Djokovic in three sets to win Wimbledon. The Serb's chance of redemption went awry in the final of the subsequent grand slam, the US Open, this time to Rafael Nadal, who was again his vanquisher at last month's French Open final. ""The team has done great work to encourage me to keep on going, I've worked on myself in tennis and off the court to strengthen my mind and learn from the experiences and now it's all paying off,"" said Djokovic, reflecting on the psychological demons he has fought. This was the first big win of his nascent relationship with Becker, a partnership that has raised a few eyebrows. ""It's a huge relief for both me and him and the whole team as there was a lot of pressure on us,"" added Djokovic. ""Since we started working there were a lot of doubts if we could win a grand slam with him as head coach, but we made it and we're going to try to embrace this win and enjoy it."" Djokovic's victory denied Federer an eighth Wimbledon title and 18th career grand slam title, leaving the Swiss without a grand glam win since 2012. But Djokovic had words of consolation for his opponent. ""Roger proved why he is a 17-time grand slam champion and why he has been so successful and dominant in this sport for so many years because he knows exactly what challenges he's facing and what to play in important moments. ""He didn't drop his level much in the whole match so he didn't give me too many points but I had to earn everything that I had today and that's why I thought the level was tremendous and it makes the win even more special.""","Novak Djokovic hails Wimbledon final win over Roger Federer as best of his career .

"(CNN) -- The Boy Scouts of America would no longer deny membership to youth on the basis of sexual orientation but would maintain its ban on openly gay adult leaders under a proposal it is considering, the group said Friday. The organization's executive committee made the proposal, which is expected to be presented to the Boy Scouts' voting members at its May meeting in Dallas. If the policy is approved, it will take effect January 1. ""If approved, the resolution would mean that 'no youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone.' The BSA will maintain the current membership policy for all adults,"" Boy Scouts public relations director Deron Smith said. Survey asks whether gay and straight Boy Scouts can share tent . The Boy Scouts have been considering a change in the longstanding policy against allowing openly gay members. In February, the Boy Scouts' national executive board postponed a vote on lifting its outright ban on openly gay Scouts and troop leaders and ordered a survey of its members on the issue. The survey showed a generational split between adults and youth in the scouting community. While most adults support the Boy Scouts' current policy of ""excluding open and avowed homosexuals, young parents and teens tend to oppose the policy,"" according to the survey, which was also released Friday. The change doesn't go far enough for James Dale, an Eagle Scout and former assistant troop leader who sued the scouts under New Jersey state law after he was kicked out of the Boy Scouts in 1990 because he is gay. ""This proposal continues to send a destructive message, offering the veneer of acceptance while still communicating that being gay is immoral,"" Dale said. ""Fair-minded Americans will not again welcome the Scouts until they stop discriminating."" James Dale: Boy Scouts need to stop discriminating . Dale's lawsuit, filed in 1992, said his expulsion violated the state's anti-discrimination law. When his case made it to the Supreme Court in 2000, the court ruled that it would violate the Boy Scouts' First Amendment protection of freedom of association to require that it accept gay members. Lawyer Evan Wolfson, who represented Dale in that case, applauded the move to include gay youth in scouting but agreed that banning them once they're adults is wrong. ""Barring discrimination against gay youth is an important step forward that is in the best interest of young people and scouting in America,"" Wolfson said. ""But leaving in place a discriminatory policy once those kids grow up still sends a damaging message to gay and non-gay young people that is inconsistent with the other values that scouting claims to teach."" Former Eagle Scout John Stemberger, founder of OnMyHonor.Net, a group opposing the policy change, said the Boy Scouts currently allow anyone to participate, disallowing only ""the open and aggressive promotion of homosexuality and political agendas,"" according to a statement. ""When it comes to young boys, parents should still have the final say on the issues of sexuality and politics,"" he said. ""Allowing open homosexuality in the BSA injects both those topics right into the program. We urge the national council to vote against this resolution and uphold the time-tested membership policy of the Boy Scouts."" There's no guarantee the approximately 1,400 voting members will follow the national board's lead in its May vote. The local representatives who are voting members of the national council are supposed to represent their local councils' viewpoints. Opinion: Ban on gays hurting Scouting . ""It is up to each (local) council and each voting member of the National Council to determine how to fulfill these obligations in a manner that fulfills their responsibility to both the Boy Scouts of America and to their local council,"" Scouts spokesman Smith wrote in an e-mail. The Family Research Council hopes to convince the voting members to vote ""No."" The group is presenting a Stand with the Scouts simulcast on May 5, asking people to watch together in their churches and homes. ""The outcome of this decision will affect the very future of Scouting, as a shift in the policy would undermine the very principles held by the BSA for over a century,"" said the council, on its website. ""This decision is too important for those who value the Boy Scouts and its value to American communities to stand idly by."" Provo, Utah, Scout leader Paul Barker sees the glass as half-full. ""I am forever an optimist, and I see it as a very big step forward in the right direction to which I will applaud,"" said Barker, an Eagle Scout and married father of four, ages 4 months to 7 years. Saddened by recent stories of Eagle Scouts turning in their badges, Barker launched Ally Patches to support gay Scouts and their allies and create an atmosphere that's more welcoming. Barker's website is selling patches similar to those Scouts earn to signal support for gay members. (The price tag is $3.50 per patch, and $1 goes to the Family Acceptance Project.) ""I had great, great leaders (in the Scouts); they were like second parents to me,"" he said. ""I took their example of love and compassion and wanted to do something.""

"(CNN) -- Unrest intensified over the weekend in Ukraine, further raising fears of a civil war or invasion by Russia. On Friday, 46 people died in clashes in the port city of Odessa. On Sunday, pro-Russian forces stormed the city's police station and secured the freedom of protesters who had been arrested as part of Friday's unrest. Here's a look at the situation on the ground in Ukraine and what might happen should the violence continue to escalate: . Is Ukraine sliding toward civil war? It's a very real possibility, analysts say. Russia appears to be guiding the country in that direction by inciting unrest between pro-Russian interests and Ukrainian forces, said former U.S. diplomat Christopher Hill. By sowing the seeds of unrest, Russia can make it appear that the government in Kiev is incapable of governing. ""So I think the Russians have a real interest in keeping this type of crisis going, hoping it can even go to a kind of civil war and basically justify whatever it is that they want to do,"" Hill said Sunday on CNN. Will Russia send in troops to support its interests in eastern Ukraine? Russian officials have said all along that they reserve the right to send troops into Ukraine to protect Russian citizens and Russian speakers against violence and discrimination by what they've termed the fascist, neo-Nazi government in Kiev. The risk of such an intervention will increase if Ukraine's military operation against pro-Russian forces results in significant casualties, IHS Jane's concluded last week. The latest U.S. intelligence shows no signs of an imminent invasion, a senior U.S. official told CNN. Would it take advantage of the opportunity to annex a pro-Russian part of Moldova? Although there's no sign of any such move, NATO's commander, Gen. Philip Breedlove, said in late March that he feared Russia had amassed enough troops to roll across Ukraine and take Transnistria, a separatist, pro-Russian region of Moldova. ""We know that capability absolutely exists to do that and cause that problem,"" he said March 23. ""We don't know about the intent. What we do see is some of the same rhetoric that was used when they went into Crimea. So if that is the first intention of -- indication of intent, then that's very worrisome."" What do we know about the capabilities of the Ukrainian military? Ukraine has about 139,000 troops, 735 tanks and 25 ships. It spent about $1.6 billion on its military in 2012. Compare that to Russia, which spent $78 billion on its military in 2012 and has 774,500 troops. Analysts say Ukraine's military is built more to guard against internal unrest and is not geared toward preventing an invasion. Wasn't Ukraine once part of Russia? It has spent more time as part of Russia or the Soviet Union than it has as an independent country since the late 1700s, when the Russian empire conquered it. It was briefly independent shortly after World War I but then became part of the Soviet Union, where it remained until that regime ended in 1991.","Analysts say civil war in Ukraine is a real possibility .
Violence also heightens concerns over Russia's intentions .
Ukraine's military is dwarfed by Russia's ."
"(CNN) -- Survivors of the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor gathered Wednesday to remember the 2,400 people who lost their lives exactly 70 years ago. ""Just as every day and unlike any other day, we stop and stand fast in memory of our heroes of Pearl Harbor and the Second World War,"" Rear Adm. Frank Ponds, commander for Navy region Hawaii, told the gathering. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus took note of the devastating legacy of the two-hour attack on Pearl Harbor 70 years ago. ""The history of December 7, 1941, is indelibly imprinted on the memory of every American who was alive that day. But it bears repeating on every anniversary, so that every subsequent generation will know what happened here today and never forget,"" Mabus said. At the Pearl Harbor visitor center in Hawaii, about 5,000 guests witnessed a rifle salute, wreath presentations and recognition of those who died. The National Park Service operates the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument, and the venue overlooks the USS Arizona memorial. At 7:55 a.m., the exact moment the attack began, F-22s flew over the ceremony in a ""missing man"" formation, and a moment of silence was observed. A U.S. Navy ship rendered honors to the Arizona. Remains of Vernon Olsen, 91, of Port Charlotte, Florida, were to be interred later Wednesday in the USS Arizona, the battleship on which he served and where 1,117 sailors and Marines died in the attack. In a statement, President Barack Obama said the veterans and survivors of Pearl Harbor are an inspiration. ""Despite overwhelming odds, they fought back heroically, inspiring our nation and putting us on the path to victory,"" Obama said. ""They are members of that Greatest Generation who overcame the Depression, crossed oceans and stormed the beaches to defeat fascism, and turned adversaries into our closest allies. When the guns fell silent, they came home, went to school on the G.I. Bill, and built the largest middle class in history and the strongest economy in the world. They remind us that no challenge is too great when Americans stand as one."" LIFE's photos of Pearl Harbor attack . Flying from aircraft carriers on December 7, 1941, Japanese aviators attacked eight battleships in the harbor, destroying two, and left a trail of death and destruction across the verdant landscape. They also struck other military installations on Oahu. The attack shook America's confidence and pulled the country into World War II. About 120 Pearl Harbor survivors attended Wednesday's ceremony. The gradual loss of the World War II generation has accelerated, and this year, perhaps more than any before, evidence of a tide change is inescapable. The Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, founded in 1958, is dissolving December 31. The passage of time, the difficulty in finding chapter officers, and the health of its 2,700 members have taken their toll. In recent years, interpretation of the attack has shifted its focus ""from engagement to peace,"" with recognition that both sides fought a ""savage war,"" said Daniel A. Martinez, chief historian at the national monument. Martinez and other staff members have recorded video interviews with many veterans, preserving their memories. ""They tell me stories they haven't told their families,"" he said.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- An international effort to save a dog on death row in Northern Ireland ended in failure, heartbreak and recrimination Wednesday when Lennox -- described by the Belfast City Council as a ""dangerous, illegal pit-bull terrier type"" -- was put to death. The dog's owner, Caroline Barnes, told CNN she was devastated by the decision to kill an animal she described as a well-behaved family pet. Lennox was taken from the Barnes family home in Belfast by dog wardens two years ago after city council officials identified him as a pit bull-type dog, which is illegal in Northern Ireland. The case provoked outrage from dog-lovers across the globe. Barnes' ""Save Lennox"" campaign went viral, attracting the support of celebrities, lawmakers and almost 200,000 people in an online petition. Vigils and protests were held by animal rights activists on both sides of the Atlantic, including demonstrations outside the British and Irish consulates in New York, to plead for Lennox's life. ""Animal rights groups have even staged protests in New York about this. We did everything possible to save Lennox but they still wouldn't listen,"" said Barnes. However, the struggle -- which involved several court hearings -- ended when the council confirmed the 7-year-old dog had been ""humanely put to sleep."" ""This was in accordance with the Order of the County Court which was affirmed by the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal,"" said a statement issued by the council Wednesday. The statement added that the council's expert ""described the dog as one of the most unpredictable and dangerous dogs he had come across... The council regrets that the court action was necessary but would emphasize that the safety of the public remains its key priority."" Northern Ireland's First Minister Peter Robinson turned to social media in a doomed, last-minute attempt at intervention. ""As a dog lover I am very unhappy with the outcome of this case,"" he tweeted. ""Spoke to Lord Mayor about Lennox. Suggested BCC (Belfast City Council) should seriously look at re-homing option. Why exercise the order if there's an alternative?"" The council was so determined to kill Lennox, Barnes said, that ""they wouldn't even listen to the man responsible for running the country."" Celebrity trainer Victoria Stilwell of Animal Planet's program ""It's Me or the Dog"" traveled to Belfast to make her own personal appeal for clemency, describing Lennox as ""an historically unaggressive American bulldog-labrador mix."" ""Victoria was willing to take Lennox under her care in the United States at no expense to the council but they even turned that down as well,"" Barnes said. Lawyers for Barnes argued that the dog had never bitten anyone and had behaved well since being impounded, but in June, Northern Ireland's top court rejected a bid from Barnes to overturn the decision of two lower courts condemning Lennox to death. A 28-day deadline for legal appeals expired at midnight Tuesday. The dog was put to sleep at a secret location, the council said. Barnes said all legal options had been exhausted and the ""heartbroken"" family finally had to admit defeat. ""We are devastated and disgusted by the way we have been treated by Belfast City Council. They wouldn't even let us say goodbye to Lennox."" In its statement Wednesday, the council claimed that some staff members had been threatened because of the Lennox case. ""Over the past two years, council officials have been subjected to a sustained campaign of abuse including threats of violence and death threats,"" said the statement. The council added it was ""in ongoing contact"" with Northern Ireland police regarding the alleged incidents.","The dog was taken from the family home two years ago .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least six security personnel were killed and eight members of Sri Lanka's cricket team hurt -- including two with gunshot wounds -- in an attack Tuesday on the team's bus by gunmen in Lahore, Pakistan. A video grab shows a suspected gunman near Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, Pakistan, Tuesday. The Sri Lankan players were traveling to the city's Gaddafi Stadium for the third day of the second test match against Pakistan at around 9 a.m. local time (11 p.m. ET) when the attack occurred. Video footage showed several gunmen with automatic weapons opening firing on the convoy from a roundabout, Liberty Square, close to the stadium. Police said at least 12 gunmen were involved. Pakistani Information Minister Sherry Rahman told CNN the attackers were still at large. Witnesses described the scene as ""pandemonium."" Images showed police vehicles with their windscreens punctured by bullets and their front seats stained with blood. A body lies in the road in front of one bullet-shattered van. ""I heard two loud explosions outside the stadium and a lot of AK-47 fire,"" said Hamish Roberts, a cameraman who was inside the stadium at the time. See a map of where the attack took place » . The driver of the bus said a police car and two security vans at the front of the convoy had borne the brunt of the attack.  Watch footage of the gunmen staging their attack » . Up to eight players, one coach and 10 security staff were reported hurt, with two players suffering bullet wounds. Tharanga Paranavitana, 26, was hit in the chest while Thilan Samaraweera, 32, suffered a leg injury, according to Chamra Ranaveera, a Sri Lankan embassy attache. Both men are in a stable condition. Six more players -- team captain Sangakkara, Chaminda Vaas, Ajantha Mendis, Suranga Lakmal, Thilan Thushara and Mahela Jayawardene -- and assistant coach Paul Fabrece were hurt by glass shrapnel.  Read profiles of the wounded players » . ""This is a very well-planned attack,"" security official Nadeem Sayed told CNN. ""The team is very much scared."" Cricket manager Charlie Austin, who represents six of the Sri Lankan squad, said none of the players' injuries were life-threatening. ""The guys are shocked. They are recovering at the moment,"" Austin told CNN. ""Thankfully they've only suffered minor injuries. They're keen to leave Pakistan and get back to their families as soon as possible."" Watch Austin describe the mood of the Sri Lankan players after the attack » . Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama said the squad would be flown home to Colombo later Tuesday. Bogollagama is traveling to Pakistan for talks with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Sri Lankan officials have ruled out Tamil separatists, who have been waging a bloody civil war on the Southeast Asian island. Witnesses who saw the attack praised the response of security officials. ""The guards were brilliant. They weren't panicking. They were very calm,"" sports producer Gavin Scovell said. ""It must have been a terrifying experience, but they handled it well."" ""Our policemen rose to the occasion and laid down their lives to protect our Sri Lankan guests,"" said Pakistan's President Zardari. Pakistan, which is battling Islamist and Taliban insurgents in its North West Frontier Province, has struggled to attract visiting cricket teams in recent years because of security concerns. Watch how attack strikes at legitimacy of Pakistani government » . The current test series with Sri Lanka is the Pakistani team's first since touring India in 2007. In 2002 a car bomb exploded outside a hotel where the New Zealand cricket team was staying. Last year Australia canceled a proposed tour in the wake of a series of suicide bombings. The International Cricket Council was also forced to postpone the high-profile ICC Champions Trophy after five of the eight participants pulled out. Pakistan is due to co-host the Cricket World Cup in 2011 with India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, although the extent of its involvement in that tournament now appears to be under scrutiny. John Stern, the editor of cricket magazine Wisden, said it was ""not possible"" to imagine international cricket taking place in Pakistan in the near future and described the outlook for the sport in the country as ""desperate."" ""Pakistan has been struggling for a while. They hadn't played a test match in the entirety of 2008,"" Stern told CNN. ""I do hope the cricket world will rally around Pakistan to find a way for the team to play outside of the country."" He said one possibility was for the team to play its matches in the UK, which has a large Pakistani community. Former Pakistani Waqar Younis bowler said: ""I don't see the International Cricket Council now allowing the World Cup matches in Pakistan. It's gone."" ""This has really damaged Pakistan,"" former Pakistani cricket player Zahir Abbas told Geo-TV. ""Already some teams didn't want to come to Pakistan. Now who will come after this incident?"" In a statement, ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said the attack was ""very upsetting for the wider cricket family."" ""We note with dismay and regret the events of this morning in Lahore and we condemn this attack without reservation,"" Lorgat said. ""I have confirmed with both member boards that the remainder of the tour has been canceled and we are working hard to get our match officials out of the area as safely and as quickly as possible."" Sri Lanka agreed in December to visit Pakistan after India called off a tour following November's terror attacks in Mumbai. Indian authorities blamed the attacks on Pakistan-based militants. Pakistan's Cricket Board had hoped Sri Lanka's tour would help it recoup some of more than $16 million it was set to lose as a result of India's cancelation. The Sri Lankan offer to tour was a reciprocal gesture. Pakistan was one of two countries that agreed to play in Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup tournament after other countries refused to travel there because of security concerns over the country's civil war with Tamil separatists.","6 security staff dead, several Sri Lankan cricketers hurt in attack in Lahore .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Kenneth Bae, an American citizen detained in North Korea for almost two years, said he feels like the U.S. government has abandoned him, according to a pro-North Korea newspaper. Bae gave an interview to Choson Sinbo, a newspaper based in Japan, which has been given access to Bae in the past. The newspaper published a picture of Bae wearing a blue prison garment in an interview that it said took place on July 30. Bae said that he heard the U.S. government is doing everything it can to have him released and thanked the American and North Korean government for allowing him to speak to his family over the phone and for medical treatment. A written family statement acknowledged the U.S. State Department's work behind the scenes, but called for ""urgent action"" from President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry because of his Bae's health. ""With Kenneth's health continuing to deteriorate, we cannot afford to wait any longer,"" the family said. ""Please do whatever it takes to bring Kenneth home. It is long past time. This is our desperate plea."" Friday is his 42nd birthday, the family said. There is no sign of this issue being solved, according to the paper. The United States is working with Sweden, which represents American interests in North Korea. Bae said he is suffering from several health problems and is worried that his condition will worsen when he returns to a special labor camp soon. Bae was readmitted to a hospital in Pyongyang in March. ""He expressed anxiety that if he is to go back to the labor camp, such symptoms may become worse and said he is stressed that he is unable to pay fees for the hospital treatments,"" the newspaper reported. Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, was arrested in November 2012 in Rason, along North Korea's northeastern coast. Pyongyang sentenced him last year to 15 years of hard labor, accusing him of planning to bring down the government through religious activities. He is widely reported to have been carrying out Christian missionary work in North Korea. Bae is one of three Americans held in North Korea. Matthew Miller Todd was taken into custody on April 10 and Jeffrey Fowle, from Ohio, was detained in June for breaking a law, according to North Korea's state news agency. ""The three Americans who are being held in North Korea are a great concern to us.

"(CNN) -- China's Shenzhou-9 spacecraft returned to Earth on Friday, completing an ambitious mission that notched up a series of breakthroughs for the country, including putting its first woman in orbit. Shenzhou-9 successfully carried out a manned space docking last week, making China the third country to complete such a feat after the United States and Russia. Hanging from a parachute, the capsule floated back down to Earth on Friday, bumping down on the arid terrain of Inner Mongolia and rolling onto its side. Support teams raced on foot and in vehicles to where the capsule lay to coordinate the three-person crew's exit from the spacecraft. After an hour of preparation work in and around the capsule, the crew members emerged one by one, smiling and waving. They were helped into chairs, as their bodies were still adapting to the earth's gravity after nearly two weeks of weightlessness. Jing Haipeng came out first to applause from the ground staff. He was followed by Liu Wang. There was then a pause before the female crew member, Liu Yang, made her way out. The three sat in a row in front of the capsule as Chinese flags rippled in the wind behind them. Still fully dressed in their spacesuits, they joined hands and were each handed a bouquet of flowers. China has made rapid, steady strides in developing its space program over the past decade, such as sending its first astronaut into space, completing its first spacewalk and launching two lunar orbiters. It has big aspirations for the program and hopes to build a space station and conduct a manned mission to the moon. Shenzhou-9 docked with the orbiting Tiangong-1 space laboratory last week. Tiangong-1, a prototype for a full-fledged space station, was launched into space in September. The crew of Shenzhou-9 followed that feat by executing a manual docking with Tiangong-1 on Sunday. Mastering the technique of joining spacecraft together manually is considered an crucial step toward China's goal of building a space station in 2020. Previously, the docking had been done by remote control from the ground. The endeavors have been a source of pride for China and coincided with the record-setting descent of a Chinese manned submersible vehicle 7,020 meters into the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean. They could help bolster support for the Chinese Communist Party as it undergoes a once-in-a-decade leadership transition later this year and deal with the fallout from the dramatic downfall of Bo Xilai, one of the country's most prominent politicians.

"(CNN) -- China's historic spacecraft docking mission this month will involve a female astronaut, state-run Xinhua reported. Either Liu Yang or Wang Yaping -- selected among China's first batch of women astronauts -- will be among the three-person crew to launch aboard the Shenzhou-9, according to Xinhua. If all goes well with the launch, which is planned for mid-June, the Shenzhou-9 will dock with China's orbiting space laboratory, making the nation the third after the United States and Russia to complete a manned space docking. As a precaution in case of an emergency, one of the crewmembers will not board the lab, a spokesperson for the space program said in February. China has big aspirations for its space program with hopes to build a space station like the International Space Station and to conduct a manned mission to the moon. China rockets forward in race to moon . On Saturday the Shenzhou-9 and its carrier rocket, the Long March-2F, were moved to a launch platform in northwest China's Gansu province to allow scientists to conduct tests before the launch, according to Xinhua. The Tiangong-1 space lab module was launched into space in September, and two months later it successfully completed China's first space docking with an unmanned spacecraft, Shenzhou-8, according to Xinhua. The efforts demonstrate ""China's continued commitment to becoming a first-class space power with an independent space capability,"" Taylor Fravel, associate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said this year. ""This is a very exclusive club."" On Thursday in Beijing, the China National Space Administration and the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission signed a space cooperation plan through 2020, state-run China Daily reported. The agreement was signed, while Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari was visiting for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit. China's efforts come as the United States refocuses its space program toward deep space exploration, and private companies like SpaceX make strides toward the commercialization of spaceflight. Last month SpaceX's unmanned Dragon capsule completed the first ever commercial mission to the International Space Station.

"(CNN) -- Chilean President Sebastian Pinera stoked an abortion debate in his country over remarks he made about an 11-year-old girl who became pregnant after being raped by her mother's partner. Abortion is illegal without exception in the South American country. The girl, known only as ""Belen,"" said in an interview that she would have the baby. Pinera, a supporter of the abortion ban, said Belen's decision shows ""depth and maturity"" and asked the country's health minister to personally watch over her health. Political opponents seized on the president's comments, creating a national debate on the issue. Former President Michelle Bachelet, who is running for the presidency once again, told Radio ADN that abortion should be an option in the case of rape. Belen is ""a girl with her entire life ahead of her and she requires protection,"" Bachelet said. ""That being said, the option of abortion, in this case, for rape, seems to be the right solution."" Pinera said that in the interest of the girl's health, doctors will consider whether it makes sense to induce a premature birth if it protects Belen. He added, ""the life of the mother always comes first, and we are going to protect Belen's life with everything medicine has to offer and with the care of the public health system."" But some say that an 11-year-old girl is not mature enough to take care of a child. ""More than brave, she is a victim and we have to treat her like a victim and we have the protect her,"" Chilean Sen. Fulvio Rossi said. ""The nation has to protect her and it has to give answers to Belen and to many other women who suffer on a daily basis from the neglect of their most basic rights."" Another senator, Juan Antonio Coloma, defended the current laws, saying that abortion should be prohibited no matter what. ""What is relevant is to help this girl who has been victim to a rape, but that, from my perspective, can't ever justify what is worse, which is to abort that child inside her,"" he said. While the debate unfolds in the media, a psychologist said that Belen's family should look for support away from the public eye. Having a child at such a young age is a lot to deal with, and her understanding the choice she made will be facilitated by denying interviews and staying out of the spotlight, Ana Maria Aron said.

"Berlin (CNN) -- Former Nazi death camp guard and onetime Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk has died in Germany, a police spokesman said Saturday. Demjanjuk, 91, was found guilty last May in a German court of assisting in mass murder as a guard at the Nazi-run Sobibor death camp in German-occupied Poland, and sentenced to five years in prison. He died in a home for the elderly where he was living pending appeal, Oberbayern-Sud police spokesman Kilian Steger said. As part of standard procedure, the Traunstein state prosecutor's office is looking into the circumstances of his death, Steger said. The Nazis and their sympathizers killed at least 167,000 people at Sobibor in 1942 and 1943, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Munich state prosecutors charged Demjanjuk as an accessory to about 27,900 of those deaths, and the court found the killings were ""motivated by racial hatred."" Demjanjuk denied the charges, arguing that he was a prisoner of war who was forced to do what the Nazis wanted. The Ukraine native, who moved to the U.S. after World War II, raised a family and worked in the auto industry in Ohio, was finally extradited from the United States in 2009 to face trial following a long legal battle. The accusations against Demjanjuk date to the late 1970s, when the U.S. Justice Department accused him of being a Nazi guard known as ""Ivan the Terrible."" His U.S. citizenship was revoked in 1981, and he was extradited to Israel in 1986. He was convicted in an Israeli court in 1988 and sentenced to death, but that conviction was overturned in 1993 amid evidence that someone else was ""Ivan the Terrible."" A U.S. federal court restored Demjanjuk's citizenship, ruling that the government withheld evidence supporting his case. But his citizenship was revoked again in 2002 after a federal judge ruled that his 1952 entry into the United States was illegal because he hid his past as a Nazi guard.

"(CNN) -- The best summer movie ever made premiered 50 years ago this weekend. It had no sharks, robots, zombies, superheroes or alien invaders. Nobody met somebody else in cute ""rom-com"" fashion and no one traveled in time. Though explosive in its way, there were no explosions; indeed, no special effects of any kind. There wasn't even much of a story; at least not the kind with a beginning, middle or end. So what was it about? Not much, really. Just four guys in suits running, jumping, meandering and goofing around all day from one crowded area to another in search of breathing room, all filmed in stunning black and white. ""A Hard Day's Night,"" the 1964 musical comedy that brought the Beatles -- and the global phenomenon they detonated -- to the big screen, marks its half-century with a new DVD-Blu-Ray package from the Criterion Collection, whose digitally restored version (from the original negative) is being theatrically released in more than 50 U.S. cities this weekend. 10 places to relive Beatlemania . Even with all the brighter, bolder, fresher-looking Hollywood product out there over this holiday, I don't think it's a stretch to say that none of them will be a better experience than ""A Hard Day's Night,"" especially if you've never seen it before. But it holds true even if you've already seen it once, twice or too many times to count. In the end, that's what a great summer movie is supposed to do: Make you want to go back on the ride again to experience the same thrills and, maybe, find something new to like about it. Not too many movies do that anymore. I don't just mean there are fewer movies -- such as ""Hard Day's Night"" -- shot in black and white, or ones that dare to tell stories in the same off-the-cuff narrative line. But you're less likely to find one now that takes chances with its material, veers into storytelling anarchy and Just Lets Go. Opinion: Why The Beatles couldn't happen in today's digital age . ""Hard Day's Night"" not only knew how to Let Go, it made its audiences do it, too. In his liner notes to the new Criterion disc, critic-historian Howard Hampton uses the expression ""euphoric blur"" to characterize the movie and the way it was made. Director Richard Lester, whose experience up till that point included TV sketch comedies for such antic British comics as Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers, applied such a loose, intimate and baggy texture to this mythical day-in-the-life-of-the-Beatles that those who first beheld it believed it to be almost a documentary. It wasn't, except for some of the answers John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr deliver in the press-conference set piece. By the time the movie was filmed in the spring of 1964, they'd answered those kinds of questions hundreds of times on two continents. (INTERVIEWER: ""How did you find America?"" JOHN: ""Turned left at Greenland."") Summer rewind: Looking back at 1964 . That was the other liberating, intoxicating aspect of ""Hard Day's Night"" -- its attitude. It refused to take anything, not even its subjects' galvanic success, seriously. When rock-and-rollers such as Elvis Presley did movies, they seemed so awkwardly sincere that you wondered if they'd misplaced the energy that made them famous in the first place. Under Lester's ""guidance,"" the Beatles showed the same brash insouciance in on-screen that they displayed in performance. (John snorting through an empty Coke bottle, Ringo deadpanning under a hair dryer while reading a magazine as the manager, Norman Rossington fumes, ""What are you up to?"" Says Ringo: ""Page five."") All this sent me to the moon and back when I was 11, and I was allowed to see ""Hard Day's Night"" during its opening weekend in America. This would have been early August, a month after the movie's July 6 London premiere. It was a Saturday evening, and my parents, along with others, black and white alike, in the Hartford housing project where I grew up, actually agreed to drive a bunch of their kids to a downtown movie house, to see, unaccompanied, what the shouting was about. How Ed Sullivan met The Beatles . At that point, I wasn't as committed to the Beatles as my sister and her friends were even before the movie started. But after it was over, all of us were so wired by what we'd seen that we wanted to run, goof and joke around all night long, even after two cars scooped us up to take us home. It was as if the movie -- and the Beatles themselves -- had given me permission to be as wise, foolish, daring, smart and alert to the world as I wanted to be. And I couldn't wait to see it again just to make sure I hadn't imagined it. It would be years before I had that chance. When I did, I felt just as empowered and exhilarated by that movie in my 20s as I did on that long-ago twilight. When my own son saw it for the first time, at age 6, he was just as hyped as I'd been. The gift that ""Hard Day's Night"" keeps giving is the right of all who see it to say to themselves, ""Take the world as it comes and when you break from its moorings, don't be afraid to be as silly or as soulful as you're able. And whatever you do, make sure you bring other people along."" Maybe I'm still dreaming all this. But I'm awake enough to know one thing: No new movie that came out this year can make so many audiences feel as buoyant or as alive as this movie did -- and does. It's possible that both ""A Hard Day's Night"" and, for that matter, the Beatles themselves were miracles that could never be duplicated. But can't the movies at least try to imagine that such things are possible?","Gene Seymour: Best summer movie? ""Hard Day's Night,"" 50 years ago this weekend .

"(CNN) -- He's still a teenager, but Wilfredo Vasquez has already seen plenty in his life. His story begins in Anamoros, a city in southeastern El Salvador. At 16, alone, living in poverty, threatened by violent gangs in his neighborhood and practically abandoned by his parents, Vasquez decided to leave everything behind and migrate to the United States. ""If you didn't join the gangs, they would kill you,"" Vasquez says, ""and I didn't want to join because I knew if I did it, I could die very soon."" By the time he left, he had managed to save $100. Vasquez traveled by bus through Guatemala and crossed the Suchiate River illegally into Mexico. He then boarded a bus for the U.S. border. At one point, he says he was detained by Mexican soldiers and questioned. His Salvadoran accent betrayed him, but somehow he was let go. It took the teenager two weeks to get to the Texas border, eating at bus stations and sleeping wherever he could. Crossroads of hope and fear: Stories from a desert bus station .

His only belongings were the clothes he was wearing and a few dollars in his pocket. He was detained by immigration authorities near Houston and sent to a detention center where he would spend three months before being released to the custody of a relative living in Georgia. Vasquez is now a permanent resident in the United States, thanks to a little-known immigration law that helps undocumented minors arriving alone in this country. The law, officially known as Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, was first enacted by Congress in 1990. In 2008, that law was expanded and reauthorized under new legislation. According to the Department of Homeland Security, ""the purpose of the SIJ program is to help foreign children in the United States who have been abused, abandoned, or neglected."" Minors who are approved can live and work permanently in the United States. White House to spend millions to curb undocumented children . Rebeca Salmon is an immigration attorney and the executive director of Access to Law, an organization that provides low-cost legal services. Salmon says that applying for this immigration benefit is difficult because you have to prove your case at the state and federal level. ""Not every kid that applies gets to stay. Not every kid who enters can even apply. You have to be abandoned, abused and neglected. You have to be without your parents. There are minimum requirements, but then there's also the rigorous process of immigration, so not every kid gets to stay,"" Salmon said. Tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors have arrived to the United States this year, mainly from Central America. But Salmon says very few can actually qualify for this immigration benefit, unlike Vasquez, who was able to prove he was the victim of abuse, abandonment or neglect. ""If that's the only message you get out through this, please make sure that's clear. If you send your kids here or kids come on their own, you're fleeing something in your country, every case is different and every case is difficult,"" Salmon said. Daniel's journey: How thousands of children are creating a crisis in America . She estimates that only about 10% of the estimated 60,000 children who have migrated to the United States in the last year alone are eligible for this immigration benefit, and of those, only a fraction can actually prove their case in court. The rest will be deported, she says. 'I didn't know I was undocumented' Those minors who qualify under this provision of the law and get approval can obtain a green card, which allows them to stay in this country and have legal status in the United States. They can then apply for citizenship after five years of living here if they have not committed any crimes, have learned English and can demonstrate a basic level of knowledge of American history and government. Vasquez turned 18 earlier this year. He's learning English in high school and getting good grades.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A series of explosions rocked central Kabul early Monday, the day after Afghan security forces said they repulsed a wave of insurgent attacks in the capital and three other provinces. The explosions persisted for some time, and followed periodic gunfire that lasted well into Sunday night in the Kabul district that houses government offices and allied embassies. There was no immediate explanation, but Afghan authorities had said late Sunday that they were trying to dislodge insurgents holed up in an empty building near the headquarters of NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Seddiqi said the remaining insurgents ""have no choice except surrendering or to be killed by the Afghan forces."" ""They came today with more than 20 insurgents and suicide bombers and attacked four provinces,"" Seddiqi told CNN Sunday. ""As a result, they got nothing, and 19 of them were killed."" The assault was a rare occurrence in a heavily guarded part of Kabul -- but Gen. John Allen, the U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan, said the Afghans beat back the insurgents without allied assistance. ""They were on scene immediately, well-led and well-coordinated,"" Allen said. ""They integrated their efforts, helped protect their fellow citizens and largely kept the insurgents contained."" He said the attacks were meant to signal ""that legitimate governance and Afghan sovereignty are in peril,"" but the Afghan response ""is proof enough of that folly."" Seddiqi said two civilians were killed across the country, and 15 Afghan police officers were wounded. He said 15 of 19 suicide bombers were stopped before they could blow themselves up, with most of them killed by Afghan security forces. And Lutfullah Mashal, a spokesman for the National Directorate of Security, said three men arrested in Kabul confessed to plotting to kill Karim Khalil, Afghanistan's second vice president. Two of the men planned to blow themselves up in Khalil's home, Mashal said. The Taliban militia that once ruled most of Afghanistan claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying it launched fighters into battle with suicide vests, RPGs and hand grenades in Kabul and the provinces of Nangarhar, Paktia and Logar. But Mashal said the three men who targeted Khalil confessed to being members of the Haqqani network, a separate insurgent group that sometimes allies itself with the Taliban. In his statement, Allen said, ""No one is underestimating the seriousness of today's attacks."" But ISAF spokesman Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings described himself as ""underwhelmed,"" and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker told CNN, ""The Taliban are very good at issuing statements, less good at fighting."" Crocker told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that no Americans had been hurt, but ""our hearts go out"" to the Afghans who had been killed or wounded. He suggested the attacks may be the work of the Haqqani network, rather than the Taliban, saying the Taliban did not have the capacity to carry them out. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said as many as seven locations in Kabul were attacked, including Afghanistan's parliament building and the American, German and Russian embassies. Seddiqi said the insurgents took up positions in empty buildings in three Kabul districts to carry out the attacks, and still held one as midnight neared Sunday. Kabul police said they found and detonated a van full of explosives. Meanwhile, an airbase used by U.S. troops in the eastern city of Jalalabad, in Naranghar province, also came under attack, the NATO command in Kabul reported. Four suicide bombers wearing women's burqas tried to attack the Jalalabad airfield where United States troops are based, airfield commander Jahangir Azimi said. At least three of the attackers were killed, ISAF said in a statement about the incident. Separately, a group of suicide bombers attacked the police training center in the city of Gardez, in nearby Paktia province. At least eight civilians were wounded, said a police official at the center, who is not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named. And 15 would-be attackers were arrested in Kunduz province plotting similar strikes, said Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the chief of police for north and northeast Afghanistan. The Taliban, the Islamist militia that once ruled most of Afghanistan, said the attacks were in retaliation for the killing of 17 Afghan civilians in Kandahar province last month. A U.S. Army staff sergeant, Robert Bales, has been charged with those killings. But Jeff Dressler, an expert on the Haqqani network at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, told CNN that the coordination seen in the Kabul attacks indicate a Haqqani-led network was behind them, and that planned but disrupted attacks in the north may also be Haqqani-linked. ""This is likely their unofficial announcement marking the start of the spring fighting season,"" Dressler said. Though the attacks didn't succeed, he said, ""The target selection was likely intended to send a message to the U.S., U.K., Russia and the Afghans that this will in fact be a bloody year for all forces in Afghanistan, particularly the east of the country."" U.S. Embassy spokesman Gavin Sundwall said he could not confirm that the embassy itself was the target of the attacks, but said gunfire had been heard in the vicinity. In a statement from London, Foreign Secretary William Hague said the British Embassy was one of the targets, but ""every member of Embassy staff is safe."" ""The Afghan National Security Forces responded to the attacks bravely, promptly and effectively, once again illustrating the significant progress that has been made in ensuring that Afghans can look after their own security,"" Hague said. The embassy premises sustained ""limited damage,"" he said, and its staff ""dealt with this dangerous situation extremely professionally."" India also said it had no reports of its nationals being wounded. A local police official said attackers took over a central Kabul hotel close to the presidential palace, United Nations office and many foreign embassies, but both Seddiqi and staff at the hotel denied it had been attacked. A western official in Kabul later said the hotel had been taken over by insurgents, but was then taken back by Afghan national security forces.

"(CNN) -- Chris Froome had claimed it was a tougher ask to defend his Tour de France title than win it for a first time and so it proved, the Briton retiring after a third crash in the space of two days. Evens favourite to defend his Tour title at Saturday's race start, Froome had crashed just four kilometers into Tuesday's stage damaging his left wrist and ripping skin off his left hip and buttock. Tour doctor Florence Pommerie declared him fit to race on, an X-ray showing no broken bones. But in torridly wet conditions during Wednesday's fifth stage, Froome crashed twice more after 29 and 85 kilometers, this time taking skin off the right-hand side of the body and forcing him to limp into his Team Sky car holding his wrist -- and out of the race. Froome's teammate Geraint Thomas had warned of the treacherous conditions that lay ahead on the stage, much of which was on cobblestones, saying: ""Nobody is looking forward to it. ""It's like riding on ice, especially with some of the corners as well. It'll be the last man standing. It's going to be a nightmare."" Nightmare it was for Team Sky as Froome crashed three kilometers before even the first of nine cobbled sections on the stage, which makes up much of the Paris-Roubaix classic, better known as ""the Hell of the North"", his team announcing his official retirement via Twitter. Two sections of the cobblestones -- or pave -- were scrapped by race organizers because of the treacherous conditions, which Sky team boss Sir Dave Brailsford described as ""the wisest decision."" Froome's withdrawal is potentially awkward for Brailsford given he omitted 2012 Tour winner Sir Bradley Wiggins from Team Sky because of the potential negative dynamic within the team due to his previously fractious relationship with Froome. In good form and a former Tour winner, Wiggins would have been an obvious Plan B but that task may now rest on the shoulders of Australian Richie Porte, Froome's close friend and near neighbor in Monaco. Froome's abandonment is a major blow for race organizers of an event billed by many as a head-to-head between Froome and Spain's Alberto Contador. Wednesday's stage was won by Belgian rider Lars Boom while race leader Vicenzo Nibali extended his lead by finish just 19 seconds back in third. Nibali now leads the race from Astana teammate Jakob Fuglsang by two seconds.","Chris Froome is forced to abandon on stage five of the Tour after a third crash .

"(CNN) -- One day before the unofficial ""Star Wars"" holiday in May, an R2-D2 replica wheeled through the front door of the Smiley family home in Bangor, Maine, to the delight of the three young ""Star Wars"" fans in the house. ""May the fourth be with you!"" exclaimed 5-year-old Lindell Smiley, decked out in full Luke Skywalker gear. In a house filled with excited shouts, it wasn't apparent that a very important person was missing from the packed dinner table. But R2-D2 had a special surprise. The robot projected a video of deployed Navy pilot Dustin Smiley, father to Ford, Owen, and Lindell. His sons were shocked into momentary silence as they watched. In the video, Dustin Smiley told his family that he loved them and implored his boys to congratulate their mother on her graduation from a master's program at the University of Maine. Welcome to ""Dinner with the Smileys."" Sarah Smiley is a Navy wife, syndicated columnist and author. She has already made it through two of her husband's deployments, first in 2001 and again in 2003. His current 13-month stint overseas, which began in November, is his longest yet. She used to mark his absence by the number of times that she had to take out the trash. ""But that ends up not being a good way to count, because I take out the trash when he's home, too,"" she smiled. Her sons Ford, Owen, and Lindell are now ages 11, 9, and 5, respectively, and she wanted to mark their dad's absence with something special that would fill up their time while he was overseas. Dinner can be a lonely time when he is away, she said. Before Dustin Smiley left, the children told their mom that they would be sad to see their dad's empty chair at the dinner table. She told them that they could fill his seat with family and friends. ""It just kind of grew from there,"" she said. So, now the Smileys each take a turn inviting a special guest to dinner every week for 52 weeks until dad returns. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, was the first official guest in January, and she talked to the deployed dad by video chat. It was 11-year-old son Ford's idea to send the invitation to Collins. Now it's off to the races: ""My kids got it in their head that they could invite anybody they wanted, if a senator came,"" Sarah Smiley said. News of the Smileys' project spread all the way to Washington through her column and her Facebook page. ""The White House contacted us and said that they loved this project and they'd love to be a part of it,"" she said. ""So my son sent a letter to the president and the vice president and invited them to dinner."" The standing rule is one special guest per dinner (the invited guest gets a ""plus one""), but when it comes to the highest office in the land, the kids will make a few concessions. ""My son said in the letter, 'Usually we invite one guest and tell them they can bring a guest, but we'll make an exception if you would like to bring your wives and your children,"" Sarah Smiley said. Jill Biden even responded to the invitation with a thank you note. Sarah Smiley won't reveal the identities of future guests to the public, but she drops hints on their Facebook page. ""As much as I want to tell people who's coming next, I know it's been a fun thing for people in the community to guess so I have to keep my mouth shut,"" she said. Sarah Smiley did indicate that they have some exciting guests who are ""involved with professional sports"" lined up this summer. ""It's just killing [Dustin] that he's not here for those dinners,"" she said. She plans to invite all of their guests back to a big celebration once he's had a chance to settle back in after his return in December. Often, the family has lower-profile but just as meaningful guests over. When 5-year-old Lindell's turn came to pick whom to invite, he selected his preschool teacher. His teacher initially hesitated, unsure about living up to the star power of other visitors, but Sarah Smiley insisted that she would make a wonderful guest. ""To my son, having his preschool teacher was pretty much like having Elvis or the president. He thought that was just amazing,"" she said. They've also met with neighbors, the town's police chief, members of the University of Maine hockey team and a cancer survivor. All of the visits are photographed by Andrea Hand and chronicled on the ""Dinner with the Smileys"" Facebook page. Sarah Smiley is always asked how she can possibly arrange a dinner party every week. ""I'm not a cook ... I'm serving people lasagna, spaghetti. There are a couple of times that we've gone out to restaurants. So there's nothing fancy at all and my house is never clean,"" she said. ""It's truly real life, exactly as we would be eating dinner if we didn't have someone there."" She said that people worry too much about presenting a perfect home and miss out on important opportunities to share memories with friends and family. ""I've never apologized to our guests,"" she said, but then backtracked. ""We had our minister to dinner. The kids truly had a knock-down, drag-out wrestling match on the living room floor. I did apologize that night."" The entire family feels her husband's absence. ""I think it's hardest on my oldest son because he's right at the preteen years,"" said Sarah Smiley. ""My middle son just got on the little league team. So there's a lot of ways that for the older boys they really need their dad right now."" She said that the boys' emotions about their dad come out in different, and subtle, ways: ""You look back in hindsight and you say, 'That wasn't like him, and I wonder if it's because his dad is gone.'"" Sarah and Dustin Smiley met when their fathers flew together in the same Navy squadron. She was born while her father was deployed, so she said that she actually met her husband, while they were babies, before she met her father. Despite all of the unique guests and experiences the Smileys have had, the guest that the family looks forward to most is the one they'll have at their table on the 53rd week. That's when Dustin Smiley comes home.","Sarah Smiley is a writer and mom whose Navy husband is deployed for 13 months .

"(CNN) -- Justin Bieber is counting on ""the truth"" to set him free. In a series of tweets lamenting all the ""rumors"" he's facing, the 20-year-old pop star seems to have responded to allegations that he attempted to rob a woman of her cell phone in Los Angeles earlier this week. ""It is hard to defend myself and my privacy every moment of the day ... The truth will set u free,"" he tweeted Wednesday, linking to a TMZ report that quotes an eyewitness saying Bieber never tried to rob his accuser. News of an alleged attempted robbery began on Monday, when a woman reportedly accused Bieber of trying to take her phone while he was with friends at a batting cage on L.A.'s west side. The woman told TMZ that the singer didn't want her taking pictures of him, and demanded she give him her phone. She alleged that when she refused, Bieber reached into her purse to take it. Bieber's rep declined to comment to CNN about the allegations, but a source close to Bieber downplayed the situation, saying ""this is another example of someone making an issue where there isn't one."" ""Justin was just enjoying hanging out with friends at the batting cage and playing mini-golf,"" the source told CNN. ""This just wasn't a big deal."" Bieber echoed that sentiment on Twitter Wednesday, telling his 51 million followers, ""don't believe rumors."" ""My mom raised me to be kind to others. I get judged, harassed, and I try to take the high road,"" he said. ""Sometimes it isn't easy. But we keep trying ... I will continue to be the man my mother raised.

"(CNN) -- It's probably one of the more unusual incidents air traffic investigators have looked into, but the good news is that when a pilot's prosthetic arm fell off during landing, no one got hurt. The 46-year-old pilot lost control in dark and windy conditions while bringing a Flybe airline turboprop plane with 47 passengers into Belfast City Airport in Northern Ireland. A report released Thursday by Britain's Air Accident Investigation Branch said the unnamed pilot's false limb became detached as he performed a ""flare manoeuver"" in which the nose of the plane is raised. The pilot managed to regain control and make a ""heavy landing,"" it said. The February 12 incident resulted in no injuries among the passengers or four crew, but triggered an investigation. ""As he made the flare manoeuvre ... his prosthetic limb became detached from the yoke clamp, depriving him of control of the aircraft,"" the report said. ""He made a rapid assessment of the situation and considered alerting the co-pilot and instructing him to take control."" However, it said, because the co-pilot would not have time to take stock of what was happening, he decided the best option was to continue one-handed. 'Safety checks' ""He did this, but with power still applied, and possibly a gust affecting the aircraft, a normal touchdown was followed by a bounce, from which the aircraft landed heavily."" The report made no comment on the incident but concluded with the pilot's own pledge to be ""more cautious about checking the attachment on his prosthesis."" It said he would also brief his co-pilots about the possibility of a similar event occurring in the future. Flybe, a UK-based low cost airline, said it had carried out its own investigation and had put into place additional safety measures. ""Flybe is proud to be an equal opportunities employer,"" it said in a statement. ""This, in common with most airlines, means we do employ staff with reduced physical abilities. Where appropriate, and in accordance with UK Civil Aviation Authority requirements, this does include pilots."" It said the pilot was a senior captain and one of its ""most experienced and trusted"" pilots. ""Following the incident, Flybe immediately undertook a detailed internal investigation from which it determined a series of additional fail-safe safety checks. ""These were rigorously tested and instigated immediately to ensure that this type of incident could not happen again."" Carpenter who cut off his fingers makes 'Robohand' with 3-D printer .

"Bartow, Florida (CNN) -- After more than three decades in prison, a Florida man was set free Thursday after a DNA test showed he did not kidnap and rape a 9-year-old boy in 1974. ""I'm not angry,"" James Bain, 54, told reporters after a brief hearing in Bartow, Florida. Bain was 19 when he was convicted on charges of kidnapping, burglary and strong-arm rape. He received a life sentence. He's going home for the first time in 35 years. ""I got God in my head,"" said Bain, surrounded by supporters and wearing a T-shirt with ""Not Guilty"" across the front. ""I knew one day he will reveal me."" Of the 245 people in the United States whom DNA testing has exonerated, none has spent more time behind bars than Bain, according to the Innocence Project, a national organization dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted people through such testing. In 2001, Florida passed a statute allowing cases to be reopened for DNA testing. Bain submitted handwritten motions four times seeking such testing but was denied each time. His fifth attempt was successful after an appeals court ruled he was entitled to a hearing. Bain initially was expected to be freed with some conditions as the state wanted a further review of DNA test results. But the review was completed ahead of Thursday's hearing. Polk County State Attorney Jerry Hill told the judge that DNA testing had excluded Bain from the crime. ""He's just not connected with this particular incident,"" Hill said. ""Mr. Bain, I'm now signing the order, sir,"" the judge said, referring to an order vacating the judgment and sentence. ""You are a free man. Congratulations,"" he said, and the courtroom erupted into applause. In 1974, the 9-year-old Lake Wales, Florida, victim had told police that his attacker had bushy sideburns and a mustache. After being shown five photos of potential suspects, the victim picked out one of Bain, the police report said. The victim, now 44, lives in Florida and was made aware of Bain's situation, according to multiple sources. Speaking to reporters Thursday, Bain said he was going home with family. ""I'm going to see my mom,"" he said. His mother, Sarah Reed, has been in and out of hospitals in recent years. She said she is putting her house and her car in her son's name. ""I want him to have something by himself. He's suffered enough,"" she said. Asked about prison, Bain said, ""So many things can happen to you at any time."" But now, ""I guess I kind of feel like when they first landed on the moon. We have touchdown,"" he said, laughing. CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","""You are a free man.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- At least 17 people were killed in central Kabul on Saturday when a suicide bomber struck a vehicle in a military convoy, according to officials. Five troops and eight civilians were killed in the attack, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. Afghan officials said four Afghans, including two students, were also killed. Among the dead was Master Corporal Byron Greff, a Canadian, according to the Canadian Expeditionary Force Command. It was not immediately clear whether he was included in the ISAF-provided figure. A U.S. military official said earlier that 13 Americans had died, but an ISAF spokesman could not confirm that number. The U.S. official emphasized details are continuing to unfold. A heavily damaged vehicle was believed to be an armored bus that was carrying U.S. troops from one base to another. A senior NATO official identified it as a custom-built, heavily armored Rhino. The attack caused a ""number"" of NATO and local Afghan casualties, ISAF said in a statement. Four Afghans, including two students, were also killed, said Hashmat Stanikzai, spokesman for Kabul's police chief. Afghan President Hamid Karzai offered his sympathies to the families of the victims in a statement and said the cowardly character of the attack demonstrates ""the very evil and heinous nature of the enemy."" A Taliban spokesman confirmed Saturday's attack in a text message, saying it killed ""16 foreign soldiers, one civilian"" and injured many others. Taliban casualty counts are often inflated; there was no other reliable indication 16 foreigners were killed. Stanikzai said the vehicle used in the attack appeared to be a red Toyota Corolla packed with a significant amount of explosives. It was unclear how many people were wounded, said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul expressed condolences to families and said it will continue the victims' ""dedicated work on behalf of peace in this country and region."" ""It's a shock. It makes you mad. It makes me angry,"" said U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker. ""We are not going to let these guys win."" The attack was one of two targeting NATO-led forces on Saturday. U.S. and coalition casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq . A gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform turned his weapon on coalition forces during training, killing three and wounding several others, ISAF said. The shooter was killed in the incident in southern Afghanistan. The coalition did not provide any other details about the shooting, and did not disclose the nationalities of those killed. In another suicide attack in northeastern Afghanistan, a woman in a burqa detonated herself near the nation's intelligence agency. She tried to enter the National Directorate of Security and was shot at, but she still managed to detonate herself, said Sabour Alayar, deputy police chief of Kunar province. Two officers and two civilians were wounded, he said, adding that the female suicide bomber was about 25 years old. Alayar said they had intelligence of a suicide bomber looking for a target, and their security forces were on alert. Gen. John R. Allen, commander of ISAF, condemned Saturday's attacks across the country. ""I am both saddened and outraged by the attacks that took place today against Coalition forces and the people of Afghanistan,"" Allen said in a statement. ""The enemies of peace are not martyrs, but murderers. To hide the fact that they are losing territory, support, and the will to fight, our common enemy continues to employ suicide attackers to kill innocent Afghan fathers, mothers, sons and daughters, as well as the Coalition forces who have volunteered to protect them."" The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan marked its 10th year earlier this month having passed two major milestones: The Taliban has been forced out of power and Osama bin Laden is dead. But Afghanistan has been hit by a wave of high-profile attacks in recent months that have jeopardized the peace negotiations. September's turban bomb assassination of former Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, revered by many as a father of the Mujahedeen movement that ousted the Soviets in the 1980s, appears to have dealt the biggest blow to the peace process. Rabbani was the chairman of President Karzai's High Council for Peace, which has been trying for a year to foster dialogue with the Taliban -- a strategy that Karzai publicly abandoned following Rabbani's killing. Nearly 2,800 troops from the United States and its partners have died during the 10 years of war, according to a CNN count. CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr and journalist Ruhullah Khapalwak contributed to this report.","Master Corporal Byron Greff, a Canadian, was killed .

"(CNN) -- Adam Silver has been NBA commissioner for only a few months. A few relatively controversy-free months. Now -- with the longtime owner of a top team alleged to have made racist remarks in a recorded conversation posted on a celebrity-focused website -- Silver is stepping down a new road. Only one owner has been suspended in 68 years. That was Minnesota's Glen Taylor in 2000, when the Timberwolves made a secret deal with a star player to circumvent salary cap rules. The league has never forced an owner to give up his team. Should Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling face either of those punishments for the recording that TMZ.com says is him talking to his girlfriend V. Stiviano? First, the NBA says, it will investigate the matter to determine whether the recorded conversation is authentic, whether it is actually Sterling and whether it has been edited or manipulated. ""All members of the NBA family should be afforded due process and a fair opportunity to present their side of any controversy, which is why I'm not yet prepared to discuss any potential sanctions against Donald Sterling,"" Silver told reporters Saturday. Silver said the league will move ""extraordinarily quickly"" in its investigation and he hoped to have an initial report in ""the next few days."" He indicated the NBA had been in contact with Sterling already, saying the league's longest-tenured owner had agreed not to travel to Oakland, California, on Sunday where the Clippers are playing the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the NBA playoffs. Silver: 'Broad powers in place' There is no clear answer as to what the discipline should be, if the accusations against Sterling -- who has yet to comment publicly -- are true. ""There are broad powers in place under the NBA's constitution and bylaws that include a range of sanctions and all of those will be considered depending on the findings of our investigation,"" Silver said Saturday. According to the website TMZ, Sterling made the alleged discriminatory remarks during an argument he had with girlfriend V. Stiviano on April 9. TMZ posted a 10-minute recording of the argument online Friday. The law firm representing Stiviano said the recording is a portion of an hourlong conversation between the couple. If authentic, the remarks seem to reflect Sterling's embarrassment and frustration with Stiviano over her associating with African-Americans at Clippers games and for posting such pictures on her Instagram account. ""This is a failure of leadership on so many levels,"" Jason Johnson, an HLN contributor and a political science professor at Hiram College, said. ""This is not the first time we have had an owner get in trouble, and they should have had rules in place to deal with these kinds of situations."" The most likely penalties, said CNN Sports anchor Andy Scholes, are a fine and a suspension, possibly banning the 80-year-old Sterling from team operations for as long as a year. TNT analyst Charles Barkley said there's no question Silver should suspend Sterling soon. ""He's got to suspend him right now,"" Barkley said Saturday night. ""First of all, they have to prove it is his voice on the tape, but this is the first big test of Adam Silver. You can't have this guy making statements like that. He has to suspend him and fine him immediately."" Sterling has never been sanctioned by the league since he bought the team in 1981. Other owners have been fined, most notably Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who has paid out nearly $2 million in 19 fines, according to Bleacher Report. One fine reportedly was $500,000, about the same amount Miami Heat owner Micky Arison supposedly had to pay in 2011. But those were for remarks about officiating (Cuban) and the lockout (Arison). And a similar record-level fine for the Clippers owner might not seem like much to the public, since Sterling is worth billions. The league probably cannot force Sterling to give up the team, which according to Forbes magazine is worth $575 million, Scholes said. According to Scholes, the NBA constitution is confidential, and reportedly the league would only step in to remove an owner if the team were in financial trouble. A team on the rise . The value of the Clippers, who were a terrible team for decades, has been on the rise with their recent success on the court. Led by all-stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, who is also the head of the players union, the team has set win records in the past two seasons. The other players will look to Paul for guidance, but a players walkout is unlikely. ""They are looking at Chris Paul and they are trying to see what can they actually do to show their disdain and dislike (for Sterling),"" Johnson said. The NBA will face an image problem if Sterling turns out to be the voice on the recording, in which a man tells a woman that she shouldn't be seen at Clippers games with Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson because he is African-American. The question would become: Could the Clippers sign any free agents in the offseason if Sterling remains the owner? LeBron James, who could potentially be one of those free agents, indicated he wouldn't consider playing for Sterling's Clippers. ""There's no room for Donald Sterling in the NBA,"" he said Saturday before the Miami Heat played the Charlotte Bobcats. ""There is no room for him."" James told ESPN he was certain Silver would take care of the matter. Jason Johnson said Silver needs to be forceful. ""He can say, 'Look, you have damaged the brand. You have damaged the league, and consequently, I think we are going to have to look at your right to own this team,' "" Johnson said. Sterling has faced questions tied to racial issues in the past. In 2009 he settled -- while admitting no liability -- three lawsuits tied to discrimination claims at apartments he owned in Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles Times reported. He also settled a 2003 lawsuit that claimed he wouldn't rent to Latinos, the Times reported. Sterling was sued in 2009 by former Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor, who said he was a victim of age and racial discrimination. Baylor dropped the race claim and a jury ruled in Sterling's favor. Silver said Saturday that Sterling's past ""hasn't so far"" played into the investigation. ""We're very focused on the audio tape ... and the facts around it."" The NBA playoffs will continue through mid-June, when the league will crown a champion.","Donald Sterling has never been disciplined by the NBA .
Only one owner of any of the league's 32 teams has ever been suspended .
New NBA commissioner says league will conduct a quick investigation .
Sterling hasn't commented publicly on recording of racist remarks supposedly by him ."
"(CNN) -- Russian police have identified two people they believe are the suicide bombers responsible for deadly bombings in Volgograd and detained two suspected accomplices, anti-terrorism officials said Thursday, according to Russian state news agency Ria Novosti. The National Anti-Terrorism Committee identified the suspected suicide bombers as Asker Samedov and Suleiman Magomedov. It said they belong to the Buinaksk militant group, based in the volatile southern Russian province of Dagestan, according to Ria Novosti. The two accomplices who are detained are brothers, both from Dagestan, and they are held on suspicion of assisting the suicide bombers in traveling to Volgograd, it said. The Volgograd twin bombings, which took place in December, killed 34 people and injured many others, heightening concerns about security in Russia before it hosts the Winter Olympics, which open in just over a week. Huge security operation . The Games are set to begin on February 7 in Sochi, and a huge security operation is under way around the Black Sea resort. Russia is pouring resources into ensuring that the Olympic Games, seen as a flagship project of President Vladimir Putin, go off without problems. A bitter battle for an independent Chechnya, lasting almost two decades, spawned an insurgency that has spilled into neighboring republics in the North Caucasus region, including Dagestan. Chechen warlord Doku Umarov, leader of the Islamist group Caucasus Emirate, last summer called on his followers to do what they could to disrupt the Games. He has said they will be held on the graves of Muslim occupants of Sochi, who he says were driven out by Russian imperial forces in the 19th century. Despite the shock waves from the Volgograd attack, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said he was confident that Russia would keep the Winter Olympics safe.","Police says alleged suicide bombers from Dagestan militant group -- state news agency .

"(CNN) -- We can spend the next few years beating ourselves up and debating the proposition that George W. Bush saved Iraq and Barack Obama lost it. Or we can get real and try to sort out what we can do now to protect U.S. interests in a region that's melting down. Iraq was never the U.S.'s to win. That point -- along with lowered expectations and focused goals -- must be the basis of any new approach to the region. And here are three reasons. 1. Demography: There are two factors that nations -- even functional ones (and Iraq is not) -- can't alter: What they are -- their demography; and where they are -- their geography. Iraq has been dealt an unhappy hand in both departments. There is, to be sure, a sense of Iraq national identity. But at the same time the end of Saddam Hussein's cruel rule -- for which the U.S. is responsible -- opened up a Pandora's box of sectarian tensions and expectations -- for which the U.S. is partly responsible -- that have never been adequately addressed. In essence, the U.S. overturned a brutal minority Sunni rule and enabled Shia majority rule. The ins became the outs, and the outs the ins. And guess what? Despite several successful elections, $25 billion from the U.S. to train and equip the Iraqi military, and another trillion in support of the Nuri al-Maliki government, Iraq never equitably distributed political and economic power. Sunnis became disenfranchised, angry and vulnerable to jihadi persuasions; Shia sought to get even, get ahead and maintain a privileged position; and Kurds sought to protect their own interests and effectively create a separate governing authority. Iraq these days isn't so much a nation as it is a collection of battling sectarian groups, each seeking advantage at the expense of the Iraqi state. 2. Geography: Iraq's neighbors, particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia, do not share America's vision of an equitably balanced and independent polity. Each of them has its own vision. Iraq has become a pawn in a regional competition between Sunnis and Shia and Arabs and Persians. Iran wants a weak, stable Iraq not aligned with the West, under Shia influence. The Saudis want al-Maliki out and are happy that the militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria may provide that opportunity, even as they fear the jihadists. They want Sunnis empowered and Iran disempowered. Turkey has made its peace with the Iraqi Kurds and hopes to get them to moderate the radical tendencies of those in Syria, but really has no answer to the ISIS contagion. Jordan is vulnerable to ISIS too, but can't exercise much influence in Iraq. And that leaves Syria. The regime of Bashar al-Assad is aligned with both Iran and al-Maliki, and -- likely under Tehran's encouragement -- has begun to use military force against ISIS along the Syria-Iraq border. All this regional maneuvering reflects the reality that the neighbors' interests will continue to trump America's by virtue of their proximity, their influence in Iraq, and the reality that Iraq is more vital to them than it is to us. 3. Syria: Iraq can't be stabilized without dealing with Syria. And to date, the U.S. -- by default the only power that remotely has the capacity to alter the course of the civil war there -- has been unable and unwilling to do that. The ISIS threat may prompt a review of the Obama administration's Syria policy, but we should be under no illusions that Washington is ready to jump in with a comprehensive political, economic, and military strategy to end the conflict. Indeed, the United States will be faced with some tough choices. It may find itself in the odd position of ramping up support for the more moderate Sunni rebels in Syria but also striking ISIS. That means we will be trying to weaken al-Assad on one hand, but indirectly strengthening him on the other by attacking a common enemy. Under no circumstances should the Obama administration commit to trying to put two broken nations back together again. Bottom line is that the real challenge is ISIS, which is likely to remain ensconced in parts of Syria and Iraq. What should Obama do? First let's be clear about what he shouldn't do. The United States needs to abandon any illusions that it can transform or find an easy way out of the situation. It is stuck in a region that it can't fix or leave. There isn't a single problem in this region that has a comprehensive or definitive solution. Instead, the U.S. should accept the reality that it will be dealing with outcomes, not happy endings, there. Iraq may never be a unified polity, but it need not necessarily be a failed one. The question is, can we shape these outcomes to our advantage? Bush 43 tried to do too much; Obama too little. Is there a balance? The U.S. needs at least three different but related approaches: . 1. Coordinate with regional partners. Sure, in the case of Iran, it's like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop. But the U.S. can't begin to deal with ISIS on its own. Iran is the key external power in Iraq. And Turkey, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have a stake in stopping ISIS's advances. The U.S. may have to accept the reality that the evil al-Assad is a hedge against ISIS, even though his policies helped to facilitate its rise. 2. Think diplomacy first, then military force. You need the first to make the second effective. That coordination must try to produce a more acceptable political arrangement in Baghdad, with or without al-Maliki. Without the Iraqi government regaining Sunni support, ISIS will continue to roll. And this means some new and more inclusive political arrangement in Baghdad to share power. Forget democracy and making Iraq whole. To bring Sunnis around and check ISIS, we may have to not only concede influence to Iran but also to some pretty bad Sunnis, including former Saddam supporters and insurgents. 3. The U.S. will need to do what it can to buck up the Iraqi military. This could easily lead to sending additional advisers, but under no circumstances should it involve the use of combat forces. We may well have to use airstrikes and drones against ISIS. And this is tricky, because it risks feeding jihadi sentiment. That's why a new political arrangement is mandatory. But even without it, the United States must face the reality that ISIS -- with money, passports, and a base of operations -- will emerge as a threat to our friends in the region, to Europe and ultimately to us. We shouldn't run scared. ISIS's own ideology will produce a counterreaction among Iraqis who will oppose its harsh, unforgiving ideology. Indeed as the International Crisis Group points out, ISIS is its own worst enemy. The region is littered with the remains of failed jihadi efforts, including al Qaeda central. In 2013, there were 17,800 global fatalities as a result of terrorist attacks. Only 16 of those were Americans. Terror is not a strategic threat to the homeland right now. But it may well require a coordinated counterterror effort with our regional and international partners to prevent it from becoming one.","Aaron Miller: Debating what went wrong in Iraq not useful; protecting U.S. interests now is .
Iraq is complex, he says, with sectarian groups at odds, neighbors with own interests .
He says U.S. must work with Iraq's neighbors, even al-Assad, to halt ISIS. Democracy can wait .

"(CNN) -- As Colorado's legislators met Monday in extraordinary session to consider bills that were not brought to the floor last week, House Democratic Leader Mark Ferrandino bemoaned the assignment of a civil-unions bill to a ""kill committee"" as a harbinger of its likely defeat. ""Sad to see Speaker during his Speaker's Session assign #civil unions to State Affairs, his kill committee, again thwarting democracy,"" said Ferrandino in a tweet that referred to House Speaker Frank McNulty and the State Veterans and Military Affairs Committee, which has nine members, five of them Republicans. None of the Republicans has expressed support for the bill, he said. Still, Ferrandino, who is gay, held out hope that the bill might ultimately gain passage. ""We're going to make our case and maybe somebody will have a change of heart,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. ""We need one person to change their mind."" The Republican speaker has made no secret of his opposition to the bill, which had garnered bipartisan support. ""Planting corn today,"" McNulty tweeted Sunday. ""What I should be doing tomorrow insread (sic) of a special session for the legislature."" He expressed similar sentiments Monday, when he tweeted, ""Special legislative session on same sex marriage brought to you by Colorado Gov @hickforco and cost picked up by Colorado families."" Gov. John Hickenlooper, who had called the special session, said Sunday that the bill is not about same-sex marriage, which is banned under Colorado's constitution. And he said the civil unions bill was not the only one that he wished would have passed during the regular session. ""On the next-to-last day of our legislative session, the civil unions bill came out of committees and they just filibustered,"" the Democrat told CNN. ""They wouldn't let it come to the floor, and when it died, 30 other bills died. And these are important to our businesses."" But McNulty said in a telephone interview that the special session amounts to a reset of the process. ""We start all over again with committee hearings and testimony,"" he said. ""We can get out of here in three days."" McNulty defended his equation of civil unions to same-sex marriage. ""It's clearly creating same-sex marriage in Colorado,"" he said about the bill. ""They can call it whatever they want, but the bottom line is that's what's happening here."" McNulty suggested there was a link between what is going on in Colorado and President Barack Obama's announcement last week that he supports same-sex marriage. ""To me, it's more than a simple coincidence that all of this is happening at the same time,"" McNulty said. ""Bills die on the calendar every year and we don't have a special session as a result of it."" In a statement, the speaker accused Hickenlooper and his Democratic supporters of ""pushing a last-minute, divisive attack on our traditional views on marriage for short-term political gain."" Outside the Capitol before the special session began, more than 100 gay rights advocates demonstrated Monday morning in a call for McNulty ""to give us a fair hearing,"" said Jace Woodrum, deputy executive director of One Colorado, a statewide advocacy organization for gay and transgender Coloradans. He described as ""shameful and unprecedented"" last week's House shutdown, which blocked consideration not only of the civil unions bill, but of more than 30 other bills. A civil union is a legal status created by the state of Vermont in 2000 and subsequently by a number of other states, according to Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, in a posting on its website. ""It provides legal protection to couples at the state law level, but omits federal protections as well as the dignity, clarity, security and power of the word 'marriage.'"" Obama said last week that he supports states' deciding the issue of same-sex marriage on their own, but added that he was ""disappointed"" by last Tuesday's vote on the issue in North Carolina, where a ban on same-sex marriage was added to the state constitution. Obama called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians, a spokesman said Wednesday. Five U.S. states allow civil unions between same-sex couples, but not marriage. Six states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to define marriage as a heterosexual union. In February, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same-sex marriage beginning in June, but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley signed into law a bill that permits the state's same-sex couples to wed as of January 1, and state residents may vote to affirm such a law. Minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in North Carolina, while Maine will have a referendum on allowing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice, one from California and another from Massachusetts, could be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court in coming months.","Civil unions bill assigned to ""kill committee,"" House Democratic leader says .

"(CNN)  -- What does it feel like to lift a grand slam title ? Who are the best players you have shared a court with ? Do you miss the thrill of competition and would you ever be tempted into a comeback ?  What could be done to improve modern tennis ? On Wednesday May 19, CNN's World Sport Anchor Candy Reid will interview husband and wife tennis legends Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf in Las Vegas and it will be your chance to pose questions like these, and others of your own. It's a simple process, just add your question to the bottom of this page. And you could hardly be seeking answers from a more authoritative source, with Graf and Agassi winning no less than 30 grand slam singles titles between them. Germany's Graf was women's world number one for a record 377 weeks and dominated for much of the 1990s until her retirement at the end of the decade. She won 107 career title, including 22 grand slam triumphs, plus a gold medal in the singles at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. Graf's most potent weapon was a blistering forehand, which allied to a strong service and crisp volleying skills made her a formidable opponent to the likes of Martina Navratilova and Monica Seles with whom she shared intense rivalry. After her retirement, she married Agassi in 2001 with whom she has two children, Jaden Gil and Jaz Elle. Agassi, who was born in Las Vegas, was earmarked for stardom from a tender age and his charismatic approach and on-court appearance quickly won him a huge following when he burst to prominence in the late 1980s. He won his first grand slam title at Wimbledon in 1992 and claimed eight in total, completing a grand slam of the four majors with victory at the 1999 French Open. Like his wife, Agassi also reached world number one and secured Olympic singles gold in Atlanta in 1996. He retired in 2006 but made the headlines again last year with the publication of his explosive autobiography ""Open"" in which he admitted failing a drugs test in 1997, but said it came at a period when his personal life was in turmoil. Agassi also claimed he ""hated"" tennis because of the pressure exerted on him by his father in his formative years. He is now rarely seen on court, bar an occasional appearance on a seniors circuit or charity tournaments. But Agassi and Graf did pair up last year to play in a special mixed doubles match against Tim Henman and Kim Clijsters to christen the new roof at Wimbledon. Now it is your chance to get the views of two of the all-time greats of tennis.","Your chance to quiz tennis legends, Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi .

"(CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin paid a New Year's Day hospital visit to some of those injured in two suspected suicide bombings in the city of Volgograd. More than 30 people were killed in the attacks on Sunday and Monday at a rail station and on a trolley bus, just six weeks before Russia is due to host the Winter Olympics. Putin's unannounced visit to Volgograd Wednesday came a day after he delivered a New Year's message on Russian state TV in which he vowed to fight until terrorists were defeated. He met with regional security and police officials in the city, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. ""The abomination of this crime, that was -- or crimes -- that were committed here, in Volgograd, don't need any additional commentary,"" Putin said. ""No matter what motivated the criminals' actions, there is no justification for committing crimes against civilians, especially against women and children."" Putin then laid flowers at the scene of Monday's attack, RIA Novosti said, before visiting a hospital to meet men and women undergoing treatment for their injuries. The blasts in Volgograd intensified fears of terrorism following a threat earlier this year from a Chechen extremist group to use ""maximum force"" to disrupt the February Olympic games in Sochi. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, described as suspected suicide bombings. 'Complete annihilation' In his address Tuesday, Putin acknowledged problems in 2013 but said the Russian people had a lot to look forward to in 2014. He also had a message for terrorists. ""We bow our heads to the victims of violent terrorist attacks. We will continue the fight against terrorists certainly, fiercely and consistently until their complete annihilation,"" he said. While security in Sochi and its surrounding area is considered to be very tight, the attacks in Volgograd, a major transportation hub for southern Russia, have raised concerns about the potential vulnerability of other areas of the country. Volgograd is a main transit point for people traveling by train to Sochi, a Black Sea resort situated just over 400 miles (645 kilometers) to the southwest. The death toll from the two attacks rose to 34 Tuesday when some of those hurt died from their injuries, state media reported. The number of people killed in an explosion at the Volgograd's main rail station Sunday now stands at 18, RIA Novosti said, citing the Emergencies Ministry. Another 16 died following the blast on a trolleybus during the morning rush hour Monday, the news agency said, attributing the information to health officials. There was a strong security presence in Volgograd for the city's New Year's Eve celebrations. More than 3,000 police and dozens of volunteers were on the streets overnight, the state-run Itar-Tass news agency reported, citing the local branch of Russia's Interior Ministry. Russian police earlier detained dozens of people in an anti-terror sweep in the city. It wasn't clear if any of those held had any suspected connection to the attacks or would face any charges. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach voiced his confidence in Russia's ability ""to deliver safe and secure Games in Sochi"" in a letter to Putin Monday. Putin's amnesty . In what appeared to be a public relations offensive designed to improve his country's image ahead of the Winter Olympics, Putin introduced a sweeping amnesty law last month. Among those to benefit were two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot, who were allowed to leave prison. The amnesty also freed 28 protesters and two journalists who were thrown in prison after being arrested in September aboard a Greenpeace ship as they protested against drilling for fossil fuels in the Arctic. Putin also pardoned former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who had been jailed since 2003 and was convicted in 2005 of tax evasion and fraud. The Russian president has also faced international criticism over anti-gay legislation passed in July that banned ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors."" In an apparent jab at the anti-gay laws, the United States announced that its delegation to the Winter Olympics would include openly gay athletes such as tennis legend Billie Jean King and hockey player Caitlin Cahow. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","President Vladimir Putin meets with security officials, blast victims in Volgograd .

"Bil'in, West Bank (CNN) -- Tear gas, stun grenades, rubber bullets and rocks: It must be Friday afternoon in the West Bank village of Bil'in. It's billed as a nonviolent protest against what Israel calls its security barrier, what the Palestinians call the apartheid separation wall. The barrier separates the villagers from their farmlands. Protesters come from all over the world to support the Palestinian cause. A few Palestinian youths covering their faces with scarves throw stones at a couple dozen Israeli soldiers in full riot gear and armed with tear gas, stun grenades and bullets. The protest soon degenerates into chaos as it has nearly every week for the past five years. Six protesters have been killed in Bil'in and the neighboring village of Na'alin since July 2008, according to the Palestinian group, Popular Struggle, one of several organizers of the weekly protests. Several hundred have been injured by tear gas canisters and Israeli bullets. One hundred Israeli soldiers have been injured from stone throwing, according to the Israeli military. The organizers say they have little control over the youths who prefer to throw stones at the rallies. They insist that non-violence is the best weapon they have to fight against Israel's wall and occupation. Israel has increased its nighttime raids into the West Bank in recent months, arresting those it believes have acted violently or those who are suspected of organizing the protests. ""They cannot be above the law, and that's what we're dealing with,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesman, Peter Lerner said, referring to the protest organizers. Critics say Israel is simply arresting those who oppose its policies towards the Palestinians. Mohamed Othman, one of the organizers of Stop the Wall campaign, was detained in September upon his return from Norway where he was lobbying the government for support. He said he was held for four months -- three in solitary confinement -- then released without charge. Israel does not comment on these cases. ""We can see that Israel is starting to be afraid of the popular resistance because it's coming from inside the people and the people decide,"" Othman said. Israel has arrested at least 150 protesters from the two villages' demonstrations over the past two years, according to Popular Struggle. More than 30 are still locked up, the organization said. The Israeli military told CNN it was checking those figures. One coordinator of the Bil'in Popular Committee Against the Wall, Abdallah Abu Rahmah, also a teacher, was arrested in December. One of the charges against him was arms possession for collecting tear gas canisters used by the Israeli military against demonstrators and showcasing them. The anti-wall demonstrators say this is a grass-roots movement. The Israeli military accuses those it has arrested of incitement. The IDF denies it has changed its tactics in dealing with the anti-wall protesters, even though the number being arrested has risen sharply. The IDF on the ground now considers Bil'in a closed military zone on Fridays. CNN was refused access by Israeli military forces stationed outside the village, who said only those who lived in the neighborhood could enter. But IDF spokesman Peter Lerner said the closure was meant only for protesters. A few hours later, in Bil'in, the Israeli soldiers withdrew from the village under cover of tear gas. Some Palestinian youths followed them with stones, while the vast majority of nonviolent protesters head home. Same time, same place, next Friday.","Protesters, Israeli soldiers clash every Friday afternoon in two West Bank villages .

"(CNN) -- Shigeru Ban, the 57-year-old winner of this year's Pritzker Prize -- arguably the world's most prestigious architecture award -- is the Rumpelstiltskin of building design. For more than two decades he has taken simple materials, including paper and cardboard, and created life-changing structures for people impacted by natural disasters. In the aftermath of the 1995 earthquake in Kobe, Japan, Ban built temporary homes for Vietnamese refugees using beer crates filled with sandbags. In 2011, after an earthquake and tsunami devastated large parts of Japan, Ban crafted homes from shipping containers. Last year he erected a cathedral made out of cardboard paper tubes for the people of Christchurch, New Zealand. From Haiti to Rwanda to China, his low-cost structures become symbols of hope for people rebuilding their lives. ""For me there is no difference between monumental architecture and temporary structures in disaster areas,"" he tells CNN. ""They give me the same kind of satisfaction."" Ban is the second Japanese artist in a row to win the prestigious award, following on from last year's winner Toyo Ito. Tom Pritzker, Chairman and President of The Hyatt Foundation, which sponsors the Pritzker Prize, said: ""He is an outstanding architect who, for twenty years, has been responding with creativity and high quality design to extreme situations caused by devastating natural disasters. His buildings provide shelter, community centers, and spiritual places for those who have suffered tremendous loss and destruction."" Congratulations on winning the Pritzker Prize. Where were you when you heard the news? I was driving in Tokyo and I got the phone call from [executive director of the Pritzker Architecture Prize] Martha Thorne. Since I was on the jury from 2006 to 2009, I thought she was just joking. I had to stop and park the car. You've earned global recognition for bridging the humanitarian and aesthetic aspects of architecture. Was it really such a surprise that you had won? Honestly, it was a big surprise. I didn't expect it. As a juror I knew the level of the past winners and I didn't think I was at that level. But then it was explained to me that this year the jury considered not only the argument of architecture, but also my activities in disaster areas for 20 years. I carry on both activities simultaneously. So I thought this was not awarded because I reached a certain level as an architect, but as encouragement for me to continue working in disaster areas as well as designing architecture. Even more opportunities will now come your way. Is there a risk this prize could actually distract you from continuing your humanitarian work? When some people receive a big award there are more opportunities for their projects and to expand their offices. I don't want to make my office bigger. I like to design everything by myself and to go to the sites. I want to keep working in disaster areas. If I get more projects then I can spend less time on each project and I don't want to lower the quality of each project. I think we have to be very careful to keep doing the same things, as we have done. How did the idea of working with cardboard come to you? The strength and durability of a building has nothing to do with the material. Even a building built in concrete can be destroyed very easily. There can be a permanent building made out of cardboard tubes. In fact many of my temporary buildings have become permanent. When I first used the cardboard tube for the interior I knew this is strong enough to be a part of the structure. Starchitects tend to devote the bulk of their time to glamorous commissions. What drove you to disaster relief? I was very disappointed about our profession. I thought that as architects we could work more for society. Historically speaking, architecture clients are people who had the money and the power. They wanted to visualize power and money with monumental architecture. That was the architect's basic job historically. I'm not saying that is a bad thing. I also want to make a monument. But I thought we should use our experience and knowledge for the public and victims of natural disasters too. I get the same satisfaction when I design a building for a disaster. There is no difference. The only difference is I am not paid. It's pro bono. Are there young architects in the pipeline who want to follow in your footsteps? When I give the lecture I always feel a strong reaction from young architects and students. They are interested in working for society and joining my team. When I was a student we used to think, ""I want to be a starchitect and big developer."" The attitudes of young people are changing and I feel that. If I have been able to help. I think this is my biggest pleasure. Do you have any advice for those who want to go into ""disaster architecture""? I appreciate when people want to come and join my team and do this work. But instead of just working in a disaster area it's important to travel a lot and to experience different cultures, different climates. It's important for them to be good architects first.","Shigeru Ban is the third Japanese architect to win the Pritzker Prize in five years .

"(CNN) -- A large portion of Syria's remaining declared chemical weapons stockpiles has been neutralized, a chemical weapons watchdog group said Wednesday. Workers aboard a U.S. government container ship finished neutralizing 581 metric tons of methylphosphonyl difluoride, a chemical used to make nerve agents sarin and soman, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said. The ship, the Cape Ray, still needs to neutralize 19.8 metric tons of sulfur mustard, a blistering agent. Once that is done, the last batch of declared Syrian chemical weapons to have left the country will have been rendered useless. Other batches of Syria's chemicals are being destroyed elsewhere, including at facilities in Britain and Finland. Last week, the OPCW said that more than 74% of Syria's declared chemical stockpile had been destroyed. Syria agreed to give up is chemical weapons last year as part of an international deal meant to stave off Western military strikes, after Syria's government was accused of using poison gas against civilians during its years-long civil war. In June, when a Danish ship collected the final declared batch of methylphosphonyl difluoride and sulfur mustard from the Syrian port of Latakia, the OPCW hailed what it called a major milestone. ""Never before has an entire arsenal of a category of weapons of mass destruction been removed from a country experiencing a state of internal armed conflict,"" OPCW chief Ahmet Uzumcu said at the time. But inspectors can't say for sure that some undeclared weapons aren't still lurking somewhere in the country. The Danish ship transferred the chemicals to the Cape Ray at an Italian port in July. The Cape Ray, equipped with chemical neutralization systems, began processing the chemicals after sailing to international waters in the Mediterranean Sea. The neutralized chemicals will be destroyed at facilities in Finland and Germany, the OPCW said. While the OPCW says Syria has given up all the chemical weapons that it declared, the country's civil war continues. The United Nations says more than 150,000 people have been killed in the past three years. The war began after popular protests against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. Syrian government forces are now opposed by various groups, including the extremist Sunni Muslim group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. That militant group, which calls itself the Islamic State, now controls parts of northeastern Syria and northern and western Iraq. CNN's Carol Jordan and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","The chemicals were among the last batch of declared weapons to leave Syria .

"London (CNN) -- Il Rottomatore -- or ""the demolition man"" -- is how Italy's incoming prime minister has come to be known, thanks in part to his pugnacious approach to politics. Matteo Renzi's nickname hardly bodes well for drumming up support in one of the most fractious governing systems on the planet, one which has speared all but one of its governments since World War II. Then again, the 39-year-old's backers say this football-fan Mayor of Florence is precisely the breath of fresh air needed in Rome's stuffy halls of power. Neither an MP nor an elected premier, Renzi has managed to wrest control of the party's leadership by promising to smash the gridlocked reform process and shift its axis to the center. How he thinks he will manage to garner more support than career politicians, like his predecessor Enrico Letta, is as yet unclear. What's more: Renzi had initially vowed only to seek the top job through the ballot box and not a leadership contest, meaning some are skeptical about what he stands for. ''What Renzi's done is gutsy,'' says Giuseppe Ragusa of the Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome. ''But he is not going to have the public's support; he doesn't have the votes from the electoral poll. So this is going to be a difficulty. Instead Ragusa says Italy is hoping that by virtue of his youth and dynamism Renzi will have the energy ''to do something very quickly."" Something, being the optimal word. Italy has been crying out for a plausible, long-term economic agenda for years, leaving the country wholly unprepared for the economic slump of recent years. Often described as his country's answer to Tony Blair, Renzi is good at talking the big picture, which is probably just as well because Italy's problems aren't small. First there's a two trillion-euro debt pile to shrink, record unemployment, crippling and antiquated labor laws not to mention stifling business and payroll taxes. Still, top of the list for Renzi, will be moves to create the kind of political stability where such measures can actually take hold. This means ploughing on with plans to reform the parliamentary system in a move which is likely to cost the country its upper house -- or senate -- in its current form. However, Renzi may be on a collision course with Brussels after suggesting the EU give his nation some leeway to breach its 3% limit on the budget deficit in order to support a recent return to growth. Vincenzo Scarpetta of London-based think tank Open Europe says Renzi will have to prove himself on the international stage. ''He is relatively little known compared to his two predecessors,'' says Scarpetta. ''So he will have to act quickly.'' Yet if anything, Renzi is a long distance player. A marathon runner and keen sportsman, Renzi already has an eye on the distant horizon -- saying he wishes to see this term through until the next election in 2018. Addressing reporters after being asked to form a government by Italy's President -- as protocol dictates -- Renzi said it would likely take a few days to get his key people in place. ''But I assure you,'' he said, ''I will give this commitment all the energy I have.'' Commitment is something this former boy scout is known for and at less than half of the age of Silvio Berlusconi, Renzi certainly has energy. But he'll need more than stamina to succeed. Above all, he must find support. READ MORE: Is Matteo Renzi ready to be Italy's PM?

"(CNN) -- Aaron Alexis, the troubled civilian contractor and Navy veteran who killed a dozen fellow workers this week at the Washington Navy Yard, is far from the only veteran or active-duty serviceman to plan or carry out mayhem directed at U.S. military targets during the past decade. It's a deadly combination: men who have military backgrounds -- together with personal grievances, political agendas or mental problems -- and who also have easy access to weapons and are trained to use them. As a result of Alexis' deadly rampage, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Wednesday announced a review of access procedures at all U.S. military facilities and also the procedures for granting security clearances to Department of Defense employees, including civilian contractors such as Alexis. Until Alexis' attack Monday, Maj. Nidal Hasan, a Palestinian-American, was the most well-known case illustrating the ""insider threat"" at U.S. military facilities. On November 5, 2009, Hasan, an Army psychiatrist, opened fire on soldiers at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, killing 13 and wounding many others. Hasan had been communicating via e-mail with the militant Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki about the permissibility of killing fellow soldiers. He had specifically cited the case of Sgt. Hasan Akbar, who while he was deployed to Kuwait in 2003, threw grenades at fellow soldiers, killing two officers and wounding more than a dozen others. Akbar had complained to his father about religious and racial harassment before the attack and had been diagnosed with some kind of mental illness when he was a teenager. Akbar was convicted and sentenced to death. The sentence is under appeal. More than a year after Hasan's massacre of his fellow soldiers, Army Pvt. Naser Jason Abdo also plotted to kill servicemen at Fort Hood. Abdo had applied for a conscientious objector status discharge because of his Muslim faith and cited Hasan's 2009 attack as an influence on his own murderous plot. Abdo's plot was foiled in July 2011 after an employee at a local gun store tipped off authorities that Abdo was behaving suspiciously. After the Fort Hood attack and a number of reviews examining the lessons learned from it, then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates issued a directive in 2010 ordering the implementation of 47 recommendations to improve ""force protection"" at military bases in the United States. These recommendations included giving military personnel better guidance on the behavioral indicators of potentially violent servicemen, establishing a consolidated criminal investigation and law enforcement database for the Department of Defense, and re-evaluating background check policies. All of these policies might have flagged Alexis as someone to watch given his long history of run-ins with law enforcement and obvious mental health issues. However, the recommendations by Gates coming out of the Fort Hood shooting specifically did not address policies governing contractors such as Alexis. This was a missed opportunity because civilian contractors now number around 900,000 at the Defense Department. That's almost double the number of active-duty personnel in the entire Army. In addition to Monday's attack at the Navy yard, 2013 has seen other deadly incidents involving insiders at U.S. military facilities. In March, Eusebio Lopez, a Marine sergeant, shot and killed two other Marines at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, and then committed suicide. The shootings may have been the result of a romantic dispute, according to a senior Pentagon official who spoke on background to The Washington Post. In July, Tech. Sgt. Matthew Hullman, who worked at the Grand Forks Air Force Base in North Dakota, confronted security personnel while holding a handgun and was killed. The incident is still under investigation. There may not be any one answer to the problem of preventing ""insider"" attacks targeting the military. But there's hope that the review of base access procedures and security clearances just now ordered by Hagel will reduce the number of such violent incidents at U.S. military facilities in the future.","Peter Bergen: The Washington Navy Yard shootings not an isolated case .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- At 160 meters long, there is nothing quite as luxurious as the world's largest and most expensive super-yacht -- Dubai. Roman Abramovich has one heli-pad on his yacht Pelorus, but he is rumored to be after a yacht with two. Except, of course, for the next nineteen boats that make up the top 20 super-yachts on the planet. Packed with more features than a Bond villain's base, including jet-ski docks, indoor swimming pools, helicopter pads (in some cases two helipads), Jacuzzis and submarines, no expense is spared on these ocean-going giants. The internationally-renowned Fort Lauderdale Boat Show is set to get underway at the end of October, where many of the world's top super-yachts will be on display. Now, you can take a look at some of the biggest and best yachts in existence. Included in our photo gallery are five of the top ten largest and most expensive super-yachts ever built -- and you'll recognize some of the names on the owners' list. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Octopus is inside the top ten, as is Oracle's Larry Ellison, with his vessel Rising Sun. Click here to view a photo gallery of the super-yachts. » . Wealthy Middle Eastern businessmen and leaders also have a strong presence at the top. Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum owns Dubai, the number one vessel, while the boat currently ranked second largest is owned by Sultan Qaboos of Oman. Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich is also a major player on this list. Abramovich owns Pelorus, a 115-meter vessel which has its own heli-pad, while he reportedly gave away (!) Le Grand Bleu (currently the world's 16th biggest super-yacht) to present owner Eugene Shvidler. As well as owning several other large yachts, Abramovich is believed to have a new super-yacht under construction. Rumored to be called Eclipse, the vessel is expected to overtake Dubai as the largest super-yacht in the world. And it's also tipped to possess two helipads -- because obviously, one is never enough. You won't want to think about how much Eclipse is going to cost, however, because Dubai, the world's current biggest yacht is reportedly worth well over $300 million. Other super-yachts featured in the gallery are Australian businessman James Packer's Arctic P, and a French-owned yacht which French President Nicolas Sarkozy has spent time enjoying on vacation. Which yacht would you most like to own and why? What super-toys would you fit your vessel with? Or is the super-yacht just a shameless display of wealth?

"(CNN) -- For more than a decade of my life, I struggled with debilitating anxiety, panic attacks and depression. And, like millions of people around the world, I longed to discover a magic pill to cure my ills and promise me nirvana. But, despite taking many medications, ongoing psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECTs), hospitalizations and failed suicide attempts, wellness remained a distant dream. The anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants worsened my symptoms, and made me more agitated, depressed and suicidal. And I was utterly confused why the medications that were supposed to alleviate my symptoms exacerbated them instead. Staring out of the fifth-floor hospital window one day after yet another failed suicide attempt, I promised to take charge of my life and create a life of wellness. I was sick and tired of being a chronically mentally ill patient. I just wanted to be well. Most of all, I wanted to be able to take my little girl to school, play with her in the park, and tuck her to bed at night with her favorite story. Somewhere deep in my soul, I was convinced that the medications were making me sicker instead of helping me heal. So, despite my fears and those of my family, I decided to listen to my inner wisdom and wean myself off all medications under the supervision of my psychiatrist and explore holistic pathways to health and wellness. Transcendental meditation . When a medical resident at the hospital suggested I try transcendental meditation to manage my anxiety and depression, I did. Ironically, it was an American teacher, Pat, who taught me this life-affirming practice that had originated in India, my country of birth. I still remember sitting cross-legged on a Persian carpet across from Pat, in the dining-room-turned-shrine in her home. While Pat sat still, Buddha-like, eyes closed, breath steady, body relaxed, face serene, my breath was erratic, my eyelids fluttered like the wings of a hummingbird, and my ""monkey mind"" ran amok. But, one day, one breath at a time, I learned how to sit still. Despite my mind's tendency to wander, like a mother lovingly guiding her wayward child back to its task I learned to gently guide my mind back to its still center. There, I discovered an oasis of energy, creativity, and restful calm. In time, meditation offered me a sacred space to reflect on my life, and taught me to become an observer of my thoughts and emotions instead of getting entangled in them. Eventually, the daily practice of meditation helped me regulate my emotions and live each moment with mindfulness. Ultimately, meditation set me free from the limitations of my suffering, and awakened me to a life filled with eternal possibilities. Exercise . During a visit, my psychiatrist recommended I start exercising, and educated me about the benefits of exercise in managing my anxiety and depression and promoting overall well-being. I joined a health club and started working out three times a week, attended aerobics and yoga classes and trained with free weights. I fell in love with my yoga classes. They relaxed and rejuvenated my mind, body, and spirit. Having never been athletic, I was surprised to find that exercise energized me and elevated my mood. It also provided a much-needed reprieve from my duties as a mother and homemaker, and helped me create a social network outside of my family. Cognitive behavioral therapy . Although I was highly skeptical about how talking with a therapist could help me heal, it transformed my life. For the first time in my life, Dr. Lin, my therapist, explained how our thoughts, feelings, moods and behavior were interwoven, and taught me how to identify negative, self-defeating thoughts and replace them with positive, life-affirming thoughts. She also taught me how to regulate my breathing to manage my anxiety, and self-talk to break through the vicious cycle of depressive ruminations and suicidal ideation. She recommended I read ""Feeling Good"" by Dr. David Burns, which further reinforced the skills she taught, and served as a workbook for my life. Difficult at first, with practice the cognitive behavioral skills gradually became autonomous as breathing. Albert Einstein once said, ""The world we have created is a product of our thinking; it cannot be changed without changing our thinking."" The tools of cognitive behavioral therapy, in essence, helped change my thinking, and, therefore, my world. Over the past 24 years, I have learned that wellness does not come encapsulated in a pill; rather, it encompasses the way I live. The consistent practice of transcendental meditation, exercise, and cognitive behavioral therapy have helped me thrive in life despite recurrent bouts of anxiety and depression. Depression is no longer a demon I fear, it is a teacher whose wisdom I seek. The opinions expressed are solely those of Gayathri Ramprasad.","Gayathri Ramprasad ""was sick and tired of being a chronically mentally ill patient""

"(CNN) -- The United States is not interested in providing weapons to opposition forces in Syria until it has a better picture of what those forces are, the top U.S. military officer said in an interview aired Sunday. ""I think it's premature to take a decision to arm the opposition movement in Syria, because I would challenge anyone to clearly identify for me the opposition movement in Syria at this point,"" Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS."" More than 50 prominent U.S. conservatives signed an open letter last week urging the Obama administration to ""take immediate action"" against the Syrian regime, including ""self-defense aid"" to an armed opposition led by defected government troops. Among the signatories were some of the leading voices in support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as well as the former head of the U.S.-led occupation government there. And Sen. Joe Lieberman told CNN last week that a ""coalition of the willing"" should assist Syria's opposition forces since Syrian allies Russia and China vetoed action at the United Nations. Lieberman, a Democrat-turned-independent who was also a leading Iraq hawk, said the United States and its allies could provide the rebels with medical aid, communications and ultimately, weapons. But Dempsey, an Army general who served two tours of duty in Iraq, warned that Syria is ""an arena right now for all of the various interests to play out."" Those interests include neighbors such as NATO ally Turkey; the region's Sunni and Shiite Muslim powers, Saudi Arabia and Iran, which is Syria's leading ally; and the al Qaeda terrorist network, which has shown signs of interest in the conflict, he said. ""There's a number of players, all of whom are trying to reinforce their particular side of this issue. And until we're a lot clearer about, you know, who they are and what they are, I think it would be premature to talk about arming them,"" Dempsey said. Syria's uprising began amid the ""Arab Spring"" demonstrations in March 2011, when longtime autocrats fell in Tunisia and Egypt and others found themselves battling popular revolts. Syria's government responded by unleashing police and troops on opposition protests. The United Nations says more than 5,000 people have been killed in the crackdown. Syrian opposition groups put the figure at more than 7,000, with government troops shelling the flashpoint city of Homs for two consecutive weeks, while President Bashar al-Assad's government says it is battling ""terrorists."" Supporters of intervention point to the results in Libya, where U.S. and NATO airstrikes helped an armed rebellion topple longtime strongman Moammar Gadhafi last August. But Dempsey said Syria is ""a very different challenge,"" since the opposition controls very little territory and Syria has a more capable military than did Libya. ""I think intervening in Syria would be very difficult,"" Dempsey said. The United States, the European Union, the Arab League and Turkey have initiated a range of sanctions against Syria. The Obama administration has said al-Assad has lost his legitimacy to rule, and it is working on ways to bolster the opposition through a coalition of Western and Arab states called the ""Friends of Syria."" But State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Friday, ""We don't think further militarizing the situation is going to bring peace and stability and a democratic transition to the people of Syria.""","The top U.S. military officer says ""a number of players"" are involved in Syria .

"(CNN) -- Four days after Neymar was kneed in the back, Brazil face the real possibility of being booted out of their own World Cup when they take on Germany in the semifinal at Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. The hosts will have to manage without their star striker after he sustained a fractured vertebra in the 2-1 quarterfinal win over Colombia in Fortaleza. It's not just in attack that Brazil have problems -- captain and key defender Thiago Silva is suspended after picking up his second yellow card of the tournament in the same match, and an appeal was rejected by FIFA. Neymar's injury is a huge blow to the hosts who, under coach Luiz Felipe Scolari are looking to reach the final for the first time in 12 years in their hunt for a sixth world crown. Wild celebrations following Friday's win became more muted when news filtered through that Neymar -- scorer of four goals in five matches in Brazil's campaign -- would play no further part in the tournament. ""It's like we have lost today,"" a female Brazilian fan in Rio de Janeiro told CNN after hearing of the seriousness of Neymar's injury. ""It's terrible, terrible. I'm so sad. But let's go on."" Sympathy also came flooding in from fans and arch rivals -- old and new. ""It concerns not only the Brazilian people but all of us who love football,"" Argentine legend Diego Maradona told the Venezuela-based Telesur TV network. ""It was his World Cup, in his country. He had great hopes."" The Albiceleste's current playmaker Lionel Messi also responded, posting a message for his Barcelona teammate on his Facebook page. ""Neymar, I hope you recover very soon, friend!"" Messi wrote, while Germany midfielder Mesut Ozil tweeted: ""Neymar, I am unhappy. get well soon."" Such is the fevered speculation surrounding Neymar there were even suggestions the Barcelona star could play if he had painkilling injections or underwent emergency surgery. That speculation was quickly put to rest by the Brazilian Football Association Monday, who said such treatment would not happen as it would endanger Neymar's future career. Dreams of a miraculous return were perhaps fueled by Brazil's obvious reliance on their stricken star. The 22-year-old talisman has scored 35 goals in 54 international appearances -- three more than the combined totals of the squad's other forwards -- Fred, Hulk and Jo -- have managed in total in matches for the Selecao. ""Brazil are too dependent on Neymar,"" former Brazil midfielder Juninho told CNN following the group stages. ""If Neymar plays well, Brazil plays well. If he doesn't, nobody can do his job. It's a worry. It's like Portugal with Ronaldo."" A member of Brazil's last World Cup-winning squad in 2002, Juninho also queried whether the current side have the experience to sustain their challenge. ""When you wear a Brazilian shirt you are under pressure even now when you play in your country. I think the players need to know how to deal with that,"" he said. ""All of the players have a lot of experience in European competition but not in the national team and in the World Cup -- for a lot of them this is their first World Cup."" Brazil's winning captain in 1970, Carlos Alberto, struck a more positive note ahead of the Germany clash when he recalled the impact Garrincha made when he deputized for the injured Pele 52 years ago. ""In the 1962 World Cup, we lost Pele,"" Alberto told Sportv. ""Maybe someone will wake up and become the Garrincha of 1962."" Another Brazilian great, former midfielder Zico, hopes a Neymar-less Brazil can prosper if Scolari deploys more ""combative"" midfielders. ""In my mind, fast players like Willian and Bernard need to be considered ..."" Zico wrote in UK newspaper The Observer on Sunday. ""Above all, the Brazilian players have the chance to draw energy from Neymar's sacrifice ... they need to leave their souls on the pitch as a tribute for this kid whose dreams have been shattered because of one horrific tackle,"" Zico concluded. Three-time champions Germany come into Tuesday's crunch match buoyed by a typically robust 1-0 win over France in the quarterfinals. Joachim Low's side are seeking a first World Cup win in 24 years after narrow misses in the last three tournaments. In 2002, Germany were runners up to Brazil -- the only World Cup meeting between the teams -- before losing at the semifinal stage to eventual winners Italy and Spain in 2006 and 2010 respectively. A hugely experienced squad -- five players have 100 caps or more -- must quietly fancy their chances against an under-strength Brazil. Not that anyone is saying that publicly. ""We're all sad that Neymar can't play, it's always better when the opponent has all their best players on the pitch,"" Germany midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger told FIFA.com. ""It'll bring the (Brazil) team together and they'll want to win the title for him."" Schweinsteiger also pointed to the pedigree of Brazil's coaching team -- noting both Scolari and technical director Carlos Alberto Parreira have previously managed Brazil to victory (in 2002 and 1994 respectively) -- and that home advantage shouldn't be underestimated. ""Their coaches have a lot of experience of this kind of situation. It's an honor and a challenge to play against the hosts, but it have would be better to play Brazil in the final,"" Schweinsteiger said. ""It doesn't matter how much experience you have, to play the hosts in this football-crazy country, I mean that in a positive sense, is something special."" The task of officiating this clash of two World Cup titans has been handed to Marco Rodriguez. Players from both sides will be hoping that he is alert to all incidents -- the 40-year-old Mexican failed to spot Luis Suarez's bite on defender Giorgio Chiellini when Uruguay played Italy in the group stages last month. Referring to Carlos Velasco Carballo's leniency in officiating Brazil's win over Colombia -- only two Brazilians were booked by the Spanish referee despite the Selecao's 31 fouls -- Schweinsteiger urged Rodriguez to be watchful. ""The Brazilians here aren't the magicians of old, the team has changed and so has their playing style,"" said the Bayern Munich midfielder. ""Hard challenges are definitely are part of their game, it's something we have to be careful of and the referee too.""","Hosts Brazil face Germany in World Cup semifinal on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The man who dominated Libya for more than four decades died not far from his birthplace. Moammar Gadhafi was born in the central Libyan desert south of Sirte in spring 1942. The only surviving son of traditional Bedouin parents, his early schooling centered on religious subjects taught by a local tribal teacher. Tribal social values, together with the religious principles learned at this time, strongly influenced him for the rest of his life. Around age 10, he enrolled in elementary school in Sirte, where he completed six grades in four years. He then enrolled in secondary school in Sebha, where, for the first time, he had access to Arab newspapers and radio broadcasts, notably the ""Voice of the Arabs"" news program from Cairo. Shortly after he seized power in 1969, a junior American diplomat serving as an interpreter for the U.S. ambassador in Tripoli noted that Gadhafi spoke excellent Arabic, like a Voice of the Arabs radio announcer. A political activist from the start, Gadhafi was expelled from school in Sebha because he was distributing pamphlets and organizing public protests critical of the ruling monarchy. He completed his secondary schooling in Misurata, and graduated from the Royal Military Academy in 1965. Convinced that only armed might could force a change in government, he viewed military service not as a career, but as an instrument for socioeconomic and political change. In the course of his time at the academy, he created the Free Unionist Officers Movement and selected its 12-member central committee, drawing on contacts made in Sebha and Misurata. The Free Unionist Officers Movement overthrew the monarchy in a bloodless coup d'Ã©tat on the night of September 1, 1969. Thereafter, the ruling Revolutionary Command Council depicted itself as a collegial body, but Gadhafi was always first among equals, directing events and dictating policy. The language of Gadhafi and the other council members was the language of Arab nationalism, guided by the precepts of the Koran and sharia, the traditional code of Islamic law, and strengthened by the conviction that only the Revolutionary Command Council spoke for the Libyan people. Over time, the Gadhafi regime created a unique form of direct democracy consisting of a nationwide system of congresses and committees designed to give the impression the Libyan people were running the government. In fact, Gadhafi, the remaining Revolutionary Command Council members, the Free Unionist Officers and revolutionary committees appointed by Gadhafi tightly controlled the political system from the start, making all important decisions. The functions and activities of the direct democracy system were regulated by law; however, the activities of the parallel sector directed by Gadhafi and his cohorts was not in any way regulated by legal statutes. Gadhafi was a revolutionary, and initially, his regime pursued a complex, aggressive and often violent foreign policy. Beginning in the early 1980s, a series of setbacks caused him to rethink failed initiatives, and after 1999, Libya sought to return to the international community. The Libyan agreement to pay $2.7 billion to the families of the victims of the Lockerbie bombing and its renunciation of weapons of mass destruction marked important steps in the reconciliation process. By 2006, the United States had achieved full commercial and diplomatic relations with Libya for the first time in 25 years. By any measure, Gadhafi's legacy is a negative one. Politically, he systematically destroyed civil society and banned political parties, leaving the Libyan people with no experience in democratic government. Socially, his authoritarian regime violated the most basic human rights, including freedom of speech, assembly and the press. Economically, he failed to diversify the economy, leaving the country almost totally dependent on income from oil and gas revenues. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.","Gadhafi, schooled in tribal values, was an activist from an early age .

"(CNN) -- Standing tall in a sport once dubbed ""boxing with rackets,"" Nicol David has a better analogy to define the particular rigors of squash. She calls it ""physical chess"" -- a test of body and mind in equal measure which the 29-year-old has mastered like no other female player since 2005. The Malaysian has deployed that magical mix of physical prowess and tactical awareness to win seven of the last eight world championships, becoming the undisputed queen of her sport despite her slight stature. ""Squash is all about dimensions,"" says David, who is only 1.63 meters tall and weighs in at just 50 kilograms. ""You are sharing the same space as your opponent, and not many racket sports have that element in their game, it's really like you and your opponent being in a gladiator ring,"" she told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""It's all about taking your space and control and using the space as well as you can, like physical chess."" Top-level squash is played in a glass walled arena of just under 50 square meters of floor space and there is nowhere to hide. It adds to the sense of the theater for the spectators, but is a daunting prospect for the players. ""Going in to the glass door and getting ready for battle, it's very, very intense,"" David says. Despite her small frame, she packs the punch of a heavyweight as opponents are dispatched in double quick time -- and has earned the nickname of ""the Duracell Bunny."" It's easy to see why. On the court she is the epitome of perpetual motion and, like the figure advertising the long-lasting battery, she never seems to run out of power. But it is also her mental strength that has helped her win the world title every year since 2008. ""It has really helped me in the last few years, all the visualization we do, and also setting a game plan that makes me certain that on court you just need to be ready for anything and stay on top of things straight away,"" she says. Dream fulfilled . David was set on the course for squash stardom from an early age, playing her first games in the city of Penang when she was just five, encouraged by a sporting father and two elder sisters -- Lianne and Cheryl -- who both played to national standard. From her early teens, David was recognized as a prodigious talent and her first world junior title in 1999 signaled a further breakthrough. But the step up to the senior level proved a testing time and in 2003 she moved to the Dutch capital Amsterdam to work fulltime with Australia's former world No. 2 Liz Irving. It has proved a formidable partnership, and David is quick to recognize the part Irving has played in her incredible success. ""I've learned some much from her, she's just been a true mentor for me to show me what's it like to be at the top."" Under Irving's guidance, success at world senior level first came in Hong Kong in 2005. ""It's everyone's dream to be world champion and when it actually did happen, I was just standing speechless. I could hardly imagine my dreams had been fulfilled,"" David said. ""I still have that same exact feeling when I won that world title because it just means so much to me."" To have stayed at the summit of her game since then underlines David's incredible appetite for success. ""If you are technically sound and really fit and strong and mentally strong, you can be a top squash player,"" she said. Intense training . David makes it sound easy, but hours and hours of intense training are required along with the right balance of rest and recuperation. ""Squash is really, really brutal to your body -- your joints especially your knees and hips and your back -- so we really need to stay on top of things and be careful with over training,"" she said. David again underlined her dominance by winning the World Series Finals title in London to start 2013, but the fact she was unable to display her incredible talents in the British capital at last year's Olympic Games remains a source of continued frustration. She has gone on record as saying that she would trade all her world titles for one Olympic gold medal, and squash's failure to gain inclusion for the 2016 Games in Rio was a major disappointment, with golf and rugby sevens instead being included. David is an integral part of the 2020 Back the Bid campaign for squash, which was unveiled at the World Series Finals earlier this month. It is also supported by supported by Greg Searle and Victoria Pendleton, gold medal winners in rowing and cycling for Britain last year. ""Squash pretty much has the whole package on what an Olympic sport should be and we have proven ourselves time and time again that our game has so much to offer. We are the complete sport,"" David said. Olympic bid . ""Our last two campaigns, where we missed London and Rio, we've learned a lot and we are ready to take up our case for 2020."" David would be in her late 30s by the time of the 2020 Games, but she will try to extend her career if squash finally convinces the International Olympic Committee that it should be included. ""I would do my best to stay in the game and to play the Olympics for the very first time, but if I can't make it then, at least I was part of the campaign,"" she said. For the moment, David savors her involvement in the 2004 Athens Games, when she was one of five Malaysian sports personalities chosen to run with the Olympic torch on its worldwide tour. ""It was truly special,"" she remembers. She has represented her country in major events, winning four gold medals at the Asian Games since 1998 in Bangkok when she was only 15. Gold medal success in the Commonwealth Games eluded David until she won the singles title in Delhi in 2010. Going into the 2006 edition in Melbourne, Australia, David was reigning world champion and favorite, but was beaten by her great rival Natalie Grinham in the semifinals. Revenge for that defeat came in the World Open in Northern Ireland at the end of the year, where she beat the Australian -- who is now a Dutch citizen -- in an epic final, considered one of the greatest in women's squash history. Total domination . For David, it was a victory that set the foundation for her near total domination until the current day. ""It was just the turning point when I won that second world title, it just proved the point -- this is where I'm at, I'm ready to move forward. It just gave me the assurance I could do still more."" Grinham and her sister Rachael continued to prove a thorn in David's side, contesting the 2007 World Open title to break her winning streak, but she has since claimed five straight global crowns. Setbacks have proved few and far between, going through 2010 unbeaten with her Commonwealth gold in India a particular highlight. Whether David can withstand the sport's constant physical demands to extend her career for a possible shot at 2020 Olympic glory remains to be seen, but few would deny her the opportunity. The decision on the hosts for the 2020 Games will be made by the IOC in September 2013, when the delegates will also add one more sport to the program. Squash will be battling it out with the likes of softball, roller sports and wakeboarding to gain admission, representing the last chance for David to fulfill her golden dream. ""Anybody involved with squash wants to see the sport get there, everybody thinks it's already in there and just assume we are part of the Games,"" she said. ""It's very heartbreaking when we are just not part of it.""","Nicol David has dominated women's squash since 2005 .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. State Department on Friday ramped up its warnings urging  Americans not to join other activists in a flotilla, expected to sail  soon, aimed at  challenging Israel's maritime  blockage of the Gaza  strip. According to  organizers, the flotilla is meant  to commemorate the  one-year anniversary of a similar flotilla that  resulted in a clash in  international waters with Israeli  navy  commandos that left nine people  -- including an American citizen --  dead. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told reporters  Friday that she didn't think the plan ""is useful or productive or  helpful to the people of Gaza."" ""We have certainly  encouraged that  American citizens not participate in the flotilla,"" she  said, ""and we are urging  that all precautions be taken to avoid any  kind of  confrontation."" Clinton's comments followed  an even harsher  statement by State Department spokesperson Victoria  Nuland, in which she criticized what she called ""irresponsible and  provocative actions that risk the safety of their passengers."" Last May, the Mavi Marmara -- owned by the Turkish  Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH -- and five other ships were on  their way to Gaza, carrying humanitarian aid and about 700 activists  from various countries, when Israeli soldiers swarmed aboard it. Despite  international condemnation, an independent Israeli commission, led by  retired judge Yaakov Turkel, later found that Israeli commandos ""acted  professionally and in a measured manner in the face of unanticipated  violence"" when they seized the Gaza-bound aid ship. In  September, the U.N. Human Rights Council found Israeli forces ""committed  serious violations of international law"" in the raid and suggested that  six of the civilian deaths were ""consistent with ... an arbitrary and  summary execution."" Israel called the report ""as biased and as one-sided as the body that has produced it."" The  U.S. State Department earlier this week issued a travel warning advisting U.S.  citizens ""against traveling to Gaza by any means, including via  sea."" ""Previous  attempts  to enter Gaza by sea have been stopped by Israeli  naval  vessels and resulted in the injury, death, arrest, and deportation of   U.S. citizens,"" the State Department statement said. ""U.S. citizens  participating in any effort to  reach Gaza by  sea should understand  that they may face arrest, prosecution, and deportation by  the  government of Israel."" Ali Abunimah, a blogger for  the Electronic Intifada and supporter of the protest, accused  Clinton  of seeming  to ""lay the ground -- indeed almost provide a green light --  for an Israeli  military attack on the upcoming Gaza Freedom   Flotilla."" Activists say the blockade is illegal and has worked to undermine Gaza's  already fledgling economy. Israel has promised to block any attempt to  break a blockade that they say is important in keeping weapons from  being delivered to Gaza. The protesters said they raised funds to   purchase a U.S.-flagged vessel, which they named ""The Audacity of Hope,""  a  reference to the best-selling book of the same title by President  Barack Obama. The boat, they claim, will carry 36  passengers, four crew members, and ten journalists. The  protesters say  they want to ""challenge U.S. foreign policy"" by providing aid and   supplies directly to the citizens of Gaza, in  spite of Israel's   blockade. ""We encourage all Americans to support our  voyage, and to agitate with the US government and public opinion to  ensure our safe passage to Gaza,"" wrote Robert Naiman, policy director  at the advocacy group Just Foreign Policy, who said he'll be part of the  flotilla. The State Department  counters that, if the  activists want to help the citizens of Gaza, there is a better -- and  legal -- way  to do it. Victoria  Nuland, the  department's spokeswoman, told reporters,  ""We've got to use the  channels that are safe, the  channels that are  going to guarantee that  the aid get where it needs to go to  the people  it's intended for."" Clinton  added Thursday that it would be unwise to move toward Israeli waters  and create ""a situation in which the  Israelis have the right to defend  themselves."" But these words did not impress Abunimah,  who wrote that ""in light of Clinton's statements, if any  blood is  spilled it will not only be on Israeli, but also  American hands.""","50 people plan to sail to Gaza to protest Israel's blockage of the Palestinian area .

"(CNN) -- Portugal football legend Eusebio, who was top scorer at the 1966 World Cup, died at the age of 71, his former club Benfica said Sunday. He died from a heart attack, the Lisbon side said on its website. The striker, affectionately known as the ""Black Panther,"" was admired throughout the Portuguese-speaking world and was thought to be among the sport's greatest players.

"(CNN) -- ""American Hustle"" has stepped up its game. The comedic film, loosely based on the Abscam scandal of the late '70s, received just two nominations at the 20th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards Saturday night, but it won the big one: outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture. Star Bradley Cooper, practically yelling his approval, paid tribute to director David O. Russell for the film. Relive all the action with our live blog . ""Hustle"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" are among the leading Oscar nominees, and at the SAG Awards the two films faced off for outstanding ensemble -- the SAG Awards' equivalent of Oscar's best picture. Last week, ""American Hustle"" won the Golden Globe for best comedy or musical film; ""12 Years"" took home that award for best drama. ""12 Years,"" about a freeman forced into slavery in 19th-century America, led all SAG Awards nominees with four nominations. SAG Awards winners list . Other winners established themselves as Oscar front-runners as well. Matthew McConaughey of ""Dallas Buyers Club"" took home the Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a leading role Saturday night. He plays an AIDS-afflicted man in the film. He won the Golden Globe for the same role last week. Cate Blanchett, who also won a Globe, won the SAG Award for lead female actor. For Oscar watchers, the awards offer a key indicator of which way the wind is blowing among members of the Motion Picture Academy. The actors' branch is the largest of any of the academy's voting blocs. The Academy Awards are scheduled for Sunday, March 2. 2014 Oscar nominations announced . Winfrey: 'We do movies to move people' Lupita Nyong'o and Jared Leto led off the awards by winning prizes for supporting female actor and supporting male actor, respectively. Leto, who stars as a transgender woman in ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" paid tribute to those who have been victims of AIDS, ""that terrible disease."" Nyong'o, who plays a slave terrorized by a plantation owner in ""12 Years a Slave,"" won over competition that included Oprah Winfrey (""Lee Daniels' The Butler"") and Jennifer Lawrence (""American Hustle""). Winfrey addressed the controversy about not being nominated for an Oscar with CNN's Nischelle Turner on the red carpet. After praising all the other supporting actress nominees, she pointed out that ""The Butler"" -- a box-office success -- has had an impact. ""We don't do movies to get awards,"" she said. ""We do movies to move people."" Rita Moreno accepted the Screen Actors Guild's Life Achievement Award on Saturday night. She and presenter Morgan Freeman fell into their old ""Electric Company"" roles, pronouncing out ""SAG-AFTRA."" Then Moreno got serious.

"(CNN) -- The long-icy relations between Iran and the U.S. began to thaw almost as soon as Hassan Rouhani, Iran's new president, assumed office. Rouhani has promised to regain the trust of the international community when it comes to his country's nuclear program and pull Iran's economy out of the mire through a series of moves that reflect a change of approach in Tehran. A clear strategy shift . Rouhani received mixed signals from pro-reform and conservative camps upon his return from the U.N. General Assembly meeting in late September. In Iran it is Ayatollah Khamenei, not Rouhani, who has the final say on foreign policy. And the supreme leader has frequently extended his approval to the president's plan to normalize relations with the U.S. and resolve the nuclear deadlock. The shift of Iranian rhetoric in the weeks running up to this week's nuclear negotiations in Geneva has not been limited to the supreme leader's support of the direct talks with the U.S. Ali Larijani, the head of Iran's parliament, has also expressed support for a recalibration of Iran's approach to nuclear talks. Toning down the anti-Americanism . The debate over whether or not anti-American slogans should be stopped as a trust-building gesture has been intense in Iran. Since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, ""Down with the USA"" has been a widely used slogan at Friday prayers and national rallies, but a number of senior clergymen have expressed their support for ending the use of such terms. ANALYSIS: Why there's room for a deal with Iran . Former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has gone even further, recently declaring on his website that Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the republic, had never approved of anti-American slogans. Although the revolutionary outlook of the establishment has, to some extent, faded over three and a half decades of the revolution, such statements by a senior political figure are unheard of in Iran. A softer approach to Israel . The official tune by the administration regarding Israel has also significantly changed. Since Rouhani's trip to New York -- and in a dramatic break from the rhetoric of former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- the country's officials have acknowledged and condemned the Holocaust and cancelled an annual anti-Zionist conference that was scheduled to take place just weeks before this week's nuclear talks. The moves perhaps indicate a mutual understanding between Washington and Tehran that the success of future negotiations may depend on a green light from Israel. Iran would also like to see the risk of a possible Israeli strike against its nuclear sites completely eradicated -- a possibility that can only come about through if Iran eliminates its own existential threats against the state of Israel. Gestures born of desperation? Iran may have shifted the rhetoric in recent weeks, but although Rouhani and his team have a track record of moderation in their political careers -- especially in comparison to their predecessors -- the recent moves would most likely not have been taken if Iran's economy wasn't crumbling due to Western sanctions. Western sanctions as a result of Iran's uranium enrichment are costing Iran up to $5 billion a month. Iran's oil production is down by about a million barrels per day and its exports are at the lowest levels since the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. The effect of sanctions are becoming unbearable for the Iranian government and there is now a palpable sense of urgency in its approach to resolving the nuclear issue. ANALYSIS: U.S. ""clear-eyed"" but hopeful on Iran talks . Despite the urgency to get a deal done, Iranian leaders will not overextend themselves when it comes to concessions to the West over its nuclear program. Iranians do not want to be portrayed as desperate due to sanctions, and face-saving -- especially domestically -- will be an important element of Iran's strategy. Tehran also doesn't seem to have a rigid and pre-defined agenda for the negotiations -- they will probably just kick off the diplomatic ping pong and see how many concessions they can get out of the talks. What comes next? Recently Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the previous rounds of negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 nations -- the United States, Russia, China, France, Britain and Germany -- benefited no one, and that their only outcome has been unfair economic sanctions on Iran. Iran has always claimed its nuclear program exists solely for sustainable development and to meet the country's energy demands -- and that its enrichment program has only been a reaction to French firm Eurodif's refusal to give Iran enriched uranium, despite Iran owning 20% of the firm. Iranian officials have also repeatedly argued that the country informed the International Atomic Energy Agency 180 days prior to enriching uranium, meaning that Iran has never been in violation of IAEA laws. I believe the likeliest outcome of these negotiations will be a concession by the U.S. to give Iran the right to enrich uranium to 5 percent. If that is decided, the most recent agreement of the P5+1 will replace corresponding U.N. resolutions on the same -- and perhaps more significantly, it will pave the way for more talks in the future. The opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of Sara Bazoobandi.","New Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has worked to thaw U.S.-Iranian relations in recent months .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The Vatican announced Thursday in a general decree that it will excommunicate anyone who would attempt to ordain a woman as a priest and the woman herself. The Anglican Church has taken a different approach to ordaining women -- even accepting women as bishops. According to the decree, the excommunications would take place with immediate effect. The decree was signed by Cardinal William Levada, prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith. It was not persuasive to Regina Nicolosi, a program coordinator for Roman Catholic Womenpriests, who was ordained two years ago. ""We have come not to take that too seriously,"" said Nicolosi, a 66-year-old married mother and grandmother who lives in Red Wing, Minnesota, and said her group is composed of 40 to 50 women priests, none of whom are recognized by the church hierarchy. ""It's one of the very last patriarchal hierarchies in the western world, and I don't know when they will be ready to let go of that."" Though she said she wants to reform the church from within, she will continue her work as a volunteer in a nursing home who celebrates mass in small groups even if she is excommunicated, she said. She predicted that the church's resistance will backfire. ""This is bringing more and more women into our group, and I think we're getting more support from Catholics who are saying this is getting ridiculous,"" she said.","Vatican threatens to excommunicate anyone who ordains a woman as a priest .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Heavy, sustained gunfire rang out in the Libyan capital of Tripoli early Sunday morning as unrest in the country entered a 20th day. On Saturday, Libyan opposition leaders announced an alternative government as the United States and other countries helped evacuate refugees of the conflict. Anti-government forces also claimed two major successes Saturday: preventing pro-government forces from taking the city of Zawiya, near the capital of Tripoli, and capturing the strategic eastern oil town of Ras Lanuf. The opposition and government forces have battled in recent days for full control of Zawiya, about 30 miles west of Tripoli. Forces loyal to leader Moammar Gadhafi withdrew from the city's Martyrs' Square and returned to their positions on the outskirts after intense clashes with rebels, according to a witness who is serving as a rebel spokesman. He reported heavy gunfire and mortar shelling and saw the bodies of three slain opposition members carried in the square en route to burial. The witness said pro-Gadhafi forces entered a residential area in the city and shot live ammunition and automatic weapons at residents in the streets. The sounds of automatic weapon fire and people yelling could be heard during a telephone interview with the witness. After a lull in fighting, clashes erupted again Saturday evening. The pro-Gadhafi security forces are using tanks, armed vehicles, and heavy weapons, and the anti-Gadhafi forces are well-armed, a second witness said. Many deaths and injuries have occurred in the latest round of fighting, and protesters managed to seize tanks and weapons from the security forces. Saturday, rebels also captured the strategic oil port of Ras Lanuf, a day after pro-Gadhafi forces fought with opposition members there, fighters and commanders said. The development appeared to embolden opposition members, who prepared to advance west to Gadhafi's birthplace of Sirte. Government forces, however, worked to thwart their push. CNN reporters following the movement of rebels in As Sidr, just west of Ras Lanuf, saw an air force helicopter pound opposition positions. There was no word on casualties. Rebels near Ras Lanuf said they shot down a Libyan air force plane, a Soviet-made Sukhoi Su-24MK that crashed in the desert. CNN located the plane's debris, spread over a kilometer (about half a mile), with the headless bodies of two pilots at the site. The plane was printed with the emblem of the Libyan Arab Air Force. In the capital, a pro-democracy activist who spoke to CNN described a city filled with tension and mistrust. The woman, who asked not to be named because of fears for her safety, said she has seen people in the streets who, she believes, are monitoring residents' comings and goings and phone conversations. ""I see cars that have people inside them, and they are usually connected with a computer,"" the woman said, adding that special antennae are connected to the computers. The same people are also interrupting cell phone signals and hacking mobiles, she said, and the internet has been unavailable since Thursday. The family's business has been robbed, with millions of dollars' worth of materials stolen, she said. Squatters have also moved into one of the family's homes. ""The police won't do anything about it,"" she told CNN. ""Everyone is focusing on what is going on politically and losing focus on the crime."" The woman said she has been trying to smuggle medication and other supplies into Libya, and that's one reason she refuses to leave -- even though so far, she said her efforts have been unsuccessful. The strife engulfing the besieged north African nation is reverberating across the country, the region and the world. Death toll estimates range from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000, and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime. The government has been reviled across the globe for violence against civilians, and the International Criminal Court this week launched an investigation of Gadhafi, some of his sons and other leaders for possible crimes against humanity. Opposition-controlled radio announced Saturday that the country's sole legitimate representative was now the National Transitional Council, a group with 31 representatives for most of the regions in Libya. The council held its first meeting Saturday in the eastern city of Benghazi. They called Benghazi their temporary location until the ""liberation"" of the capital, according to a decree the council issued late in the day. Former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdeljeleel, whom the council said had tried to resign from Gadhafi's government several times, was announced as the council's new leader. The council also named a representative for military affairs and established a military council to oversee the ""liberation"" of Libya and reconstruct the armed forces, according to the radio announcement. The council said its main missions are to represent all of Libya internationally, liberate the country, draft a constitution and hold elections. In Benghazi, witnesses said forces loyal to Gadhafi pounded a weapons depot, an airstrike that caused casualties and widespread damage. One witness said the airstrike there was powerful enough ""to destroy a whole city."" News footage showed the remains of buildings and debris and ambulances arriving. Such aerial attacks have prompted the West to step up discussions about imposing a no-fly zone over Libya. U.S. military and diplomatic officials have said such a zone would be complicated and risky, and international support for it is not strong. ""If it's ordered, we can do it,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said earlier this week, but imposing a no-fly zone ""begins with an attack on Libya to destroy the air defenses."" The Arab League has rejected international intervention, saying Libya is facing ""an internal affair that is decided by the people and their governments."" However, the league cannot ignore the suffering of civilians and would consider the imposition of a no-fly zone in coordination with the African Union if fighting were to continue, said Hisham Yousef, chief of staff of the Arab League, on Wednesday. The fierce fighting has sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya, with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave. Almost 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt, the United Nations refugee agency said. The United States announced Saturday it is contributing $3 million to the International Organization for Migration to help return home thousands of non-Libyans who fled to Tunisia. Four U.S. military flights Saturday were taking a total of 312 Egyptians back to Cairo, the U.S. State Department announced. Thursday and Friday, about 1,800 people crossed from Libya to Tunisia, and about 3,000 crossed on Saturday, said Firas Kayal, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. He said the situation at the border is ""very calm."" A few thousand Egyptians are in Tunisia awaiting travel home, and more than 10,000 Bangladeshis are there awaiting evacuation with hundreds more still arriving, Kayal said. The agency confirmed that a Bangladeshi migrant worker died after a heart attack from the exhaustion of walking to the border. Many migrant workers told aid workers they had to walk to the border because soldiers took their money and they couldn't afford paying for a taxi.

"(CNN) -- Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was placed under formal investigation early Wednesday in connection with suspected corruption and influence peddling, French media said. He appeared before a court overnight after a day of questioning in a Paris suburb, CNN's French affiliate BFMTV reported. He is reportedly the first French president to be held in police custody in connection with an investigation. Sarkozy, speaking to French broadcasters TF1 and Europe 1, said Wednesday he was ""deeply shocked."" In the taped joint interview, Sarkozy said that there is a ""willingness to humiliate"" him, and that he ""never committed any act contrary to republican principles or the rule of law."" The former President added that he ""is not asking for any privilege"" and that he ""is not a man who escapes from his responsibilities."" Sarkozy's lawyer, Thierry Herzog, and a high-ranking magistrate, Gilbert Azibert, were also placed under formal investigation Tuesday, BFMTV said. They were called in for questioning Monday, along with another magistrate who was not brought before a judge. Prime Minister Manuel Valls told BFMTV Wednesday that Sarkozy faced a ""serious situation"" and ""serious facts."" ""No one is above the law, but it is important to remember that the presumption of innocence applies to everyone,"" he said. Investigators who have been looking into Sarkozy's campaign financing are trying to establish whether the former President obtained confidential information on legal cases concerning him from magistrates in exchange for the offer of a prestigious post, BFMTV reported. Sarkozy, who led the country from 2007 to 2012, lost in the 2012 presidential election to Socialist rival Francois Hollande. In recent months, speculation has grown that he might be positioning himself for a political comeback at the head of his center-right party, the UMP. The latest investigation into his actions could prove damaging to his ambitions even if no charge follows. Prime Minister Valls, in his interview with BFMTV, rejected any suggestion that the investigation was politically motivated, insisting that judges work entirely independently. It's not the authorities who have asked these judges to investigate, he said. The offense of ""active corruption"" carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a fine, under the French penal code. Influence peddling is punishable by up to five years in prison and a 500,000 euro ($683,000) fine. Bordeaux Mayor Alain Juppe, a UMP politician who formerly served as prime minister and foreign minister, said via Twitter that he was thinking of Sarkozy in a spirit of friendship. ""He is, of course, presumed innocent. His defense will demonstrate his innocence, I hope,"" he posted.","NEW: Sarkozy tells French media he is ""deeply shocked""

"London (CNN) -- The jury in the phone hacking trial of former newspaper editor and ex-Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson has been discharged after it could not reach a verdict on the final charges in the case, a court official said Wednesday. Former News of the World editor Coulson was convicted Tuesday of conspiracy to hack phones between 2000 and 2006. But the jury was not able to reach a decision Wednesday on two charges each of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office against Coulson and the paper's former royal editor, Clive Goodman. The court said that a decision on a retrial for these charges would be made Monday. Another of Rupert Murdoch's former newspaper chiefs, Rebekah Brooks, was unanimously cleared of all charges Tuesday after the eight-month trial at the Old Bailey court. Shortly before the jury was discharged, the judge in the case, John Saunders, issued an unusual rebuke to Prime Minister David Cameron and ""a large number of politicians from all parties"" for commenting on the case after the partial verdicts Tuesday. ""I consider that what has happened is unsatisfactory so far as justice and the rule of law are concerned,"" Saunders said in his ruling. ""The press in court have been extremely responsible in their reporting of this case but when politicians regard it as open season, one cannot expect the press to remain silent."" The ruling followed an application for the jury to be discharged on the basis that it was no longer possible for Coulson and Goodman to have a fair trial because of those comments. But the judge said he had decided not to discharge the jury on those grounds. ""I am satisfied that the jury will continue to try Mr. Coulson and Mr. Goodman on the evidence that they have heard in court and solely on that evidence,"" he said. A spokesman for the Prime Minister's office said that Cameron had taken the ""best legal advice"" before giving a statement Tuesday. Cameron: 'Wrong decision' Speaking before the House of Commons on Wednesday, Cameron repeated the apology he'd made a day earlier for hiring Coulson as his director of communications in 2007. ""I am sorry, this was the wrong decision, but I think it's right that we've had a public inquiry in this country, and it's right that we have proper investigations,"" he said. ""Yesterday once again showed that no one is above the law in our country."" Public and political outrage over the hacking revelations led to the closure of the 168-year-old News of the World paper and the setting up of a public inquiry to examine journalistic ethics, known as the Leveson Inquiry, as well as a police investigation. In a statement Wednesday, Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner who oversaw the investigation, said it had been ""complex and challenging"" -- and that officers involved had been aware of the ""sensitivities"" of investigating a national newspaper and confidential journalistic material. ""This investigation has never been about an attack on press freedom but one to establish whether any criminal offenses had been committed, to establish who was responsible for committing them and to bring them to justice. The victims deserved no less,"" she said. ""Along with the verdicts, I hope this will give some comfort to the many victims that justice has been served."" The Metropolitan Police investigation into phone hacking, which was launched in January 2011 and dubbed Operation Weeting, identified 5,500 victims. Of those, 3,500 have been contacted, a police statement said. The investigation involved sifting through millions of e-mails, tens of thousands of documents, other data communications and financial transactions, it said. Murdered schoolgirl . Tuesday's verdicts came three years after it was revealed that journalists on News of the World hacked the voice mail of then-missing teenager Milly Dowler in 2002, raising hopes that she was alive and checking messages, when in fact she had been murdered. At the time the schoolgirl's voice mail was intercepted, Brooks was editor of Britain's top-selling News of the World, and Coulson was her deputy. After Coulson succeeded her as editor, Brooks edited The Sun newspaper, and she later became chief executive of the parent company, News International -- now known as News UK. Coulson resigned as News of the World editor in 2007 after its then-royal editor, Goodman, and a private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, were jailed for hacking into voice-mail messages left for royal aides. Coulson denied any wrongdoing and later became Cameron's director of communications. The former editor resigned from his Downing Street position in 2011 as coverage of the phone hacking scandal broadened. 'Wrongdoing occurred' Besides a charge of conspiracy to hack voice mails, Brooks also was accused of conspiring to pervert the course of justice, as was her husband, Charlie Brooks, and her former personal assistant, Cheryl Carter. All three were cleared of those charges, the Press Association reported, as was former News International head of security Mark Hanna. Retired managing editor Stuart Kuttner was cleared of conspiracy to hack phones. Five people pleaded guilty to phone hacking charges before the case came to trial, the police said. They were Mulcaire, Neville Thurlbeck, Greg Miskiw, James Weatherup and Daniel Evans. News UK, the UK newspaper publishing arm of Murdoch's News Corp., said in a statement: ""We said long ago, and repeat today, that wrongdoing occurred, and we apologized for it. We have been paying compensation to those affected and have cooperated with investigations."" The publisher said it was making changes to ensure this kind of wrongdoing did not recur and that it supported a new UK press watchdog expected to start work later this year.

"FORT COLLINS, Colorado (CNN)  -- The College Republicans, a student organization at Colorado State University, weren't planning anything special for the last week of September. Colorado State student Yael Yund, 21, signs a petition calling for David McSwane's resignation. Then on September 21, David McSwane, the editor-in-chief of The Rocky Mountain Collegian, the daily student newspaper, printed the four-word column that sparked a national free speech debate and sent the College Republicans into action, writing a petition to force him to resign. ""Taser this: F**k Bush"" was printed on the opinion page of the newspaper, causing CSU president Larry Penley to issue a formal statement and the Board of Student Communications to plan a meeting for Wednesday night. During the meeting they will decide on the fate of McSwane and his future involvement with the publication. ""We'll present our petition to the board at the meeting,"" said student Chelsey Penoyer, the chairman of the College Republicans. ""We're petitioning that he should resign on his own. The petition also urges students to think twice before going to businesses who continue advertising with The Collegian."" In a confidential memo mistakenly released to the local newspaper, The Coloradoan, Fort Collins businesses have already pulled out $30,000 in advertising with The Collegian, which relies completely on external revenue to operate, not student fees. According to the memo, to make up for the loss, student employee wages were cut by 10 percent, the newspaper reported. McSwane confirmed the memo after its release. McSwane has defended his actions, referring to the incident involving a college student who was Tasered at a recent John Kerry speech in Florida. He said that his decision was exercising his right to free speech. He refused to comment for this story. Students around the CSU campus expressed a majority feeling that while they felt McSwane's right to free speech should be protected, many of them felt as though he misused it. ""At first I totally supported him and the paper,"" said senior Evan Isoline, who read the initial column when it came out. ""I thought he was making a political statement and then throwing away his college career at the paper. I thought he would resign right away. ""Now you look at it and it's like, 'Taser this. Taser what?' The issue isn't even about President Bush. If you're going to stand up for something like that you have to have something to back it up. You have to believe in something."" Some students however have stopped in to the newsroom in support of the paper's actions. ""I completely support him and the paper for their decision,"" said Alesia Gifford, vice president of the Young Democrats, another political student organization. ""In this society we are taking a step backwards, especially with the free speech debate. President Bush has lost our respect as a country. ""At some point we have to stand up for our rights. [McSwane] was just showing that speech, even when explicit, should always be protected by the First Amendment."" Many more students however were shocked at the paper's decision and failed to see the political stance they took. In addition to writing a column they felt lacked substance, students also were concerned of what it would do to the university's image. ""It makes the students at Colorado State look like a bunch of uneducated children who don't have anything intelligent to say,"" Penoyer said. ""So we just yell bad words.""

"(CNN) -- The elusive graffiti artist Banksy made his mark on a painting bought for just $50 from a New York City thrift store, and bidding has exceeded $300,000 in a charity auction. Interactive map: Where to find Banksy in New York . The painting, which the famously anonymous British graffiti artist entitled ""The Banality of the Banality of Evil,"" is being auctioned off to benefit Housing Works, a nonprofit that supports homelessness and those living or affected with HIV/AIDS, according to spokeswoman Rebecca Edmondson. The painting was dropped off at the store in New York's Gramercy area by an anonymous person on Tuesday. ""The painting came in as secretly as we could have anticipated based on Banksy's reputation,"" Edmondson said, ""Our retailer that was working was told it was special and given a little note."" Could the next Banksy come from Dubai? According to Housing Works, the painting was purchased from the same shop a couple months ago for $50. The charity has thrift shops across New York City that help fund the services they provide. ""A thrift store painting vandalized then re-donated to the thrift store,"" Banksy described on his website. ""There was definitely a plan in place,"" Edmondson said. The painting is now being auctioned on Bidding For Good, a platform for online and mobile auctions. The painting went up for online auction on October 29 with a starting minimum bid of $74,000. Bidding will end at 8 p.m. on October 31. Known for his signature street-art style of stencils spray-painted on streets, walls, and under bridges, Banksy brought a new element to his work with this oil on canvas. The painting depicts a countryside landscape featuring a large lake, trees with autumn colors, and snowy mountains in the background. The one outlier is an officer on a bench in the foreground with what appears to be a Nazi symbol stitched to his right sleeve. Opinion: Banksy's insult shows he's clueless about New York . Banksy has stirred some controversy in New York City during his month-long street-art residency, ""Better Out Than In."" He angered New Yorkers most recently with his critique of the One World Trade Center design. Housing Works, however, is not judging the meaning behind his work. ""Banksy is giving back to the New York community that has watched his every move over the last month,"" Edmondson said, ""Nothing but good could come of it."" Housing Works was contacted by Banksy's team to confirm the donation and authenticate the painting signed by Banksy under the original artist, K. Sager. ""They were pretty straightforward,"" Edmondson said, ""We were given permission to auction it off."" Edmonson estimates that the auction will pull in $1 million. Banksy debuted the latest addition to his New York City art collection on Wednesday with ""Bronx Zoo,"" a graffiti painting of a growling wild cat resting on a railing, outside of Yankee Stadium, according to his website.

"(CNN) -- I first heard Jim Brady's name as I was walking into my college cafeteria early one evening in 1981. A somber radio voice announced the passing of Brady, the White House Press Secretary who had been shot along with President Ronald Reagan, not more than a couple of miles from campus. Thankfully, the report turned out to be wrong. Brady survived his wounds that day, although he was left with slurred speech, partial paralysis and difficulty walking. It was not the first, nor the last time Jim Brady's strength and resilience was underestimated. Although I could not have predicted it at the time, it was not the last time I'd hear about Jim Brady. James Brady, former Reagan press secretary, gun-control advocate, dies . I'd like to think Jim and I had a few things in common. We both worked our way up in the rough and tumble politics game. We both had a distant dream that someday we'd get to work in the White House briefing room. Jim found his guy with the former governor of California. Mine was the governor from Arkansas. But I don't look at Jim as a colleague or a fellow warrior who survived the verbal battle that is the White House briefing room. Jim is, and always will be, something bigger, something that transcends politics and Washington celebrity. I remember speaking to a group of young students one day in the briefing room. One of the kids asked me who my hero was. I don't think anyone had ever asked me that before. But it didn't take long for me to tell them the heroic story of Jim Brady. I explained that Jim had something terrible happen to him. He was just doing his job one day, a job he loved, when everything he knew about his life and the world was turned upside down. Congress, finish the job on Brady background checks . With great strength and perseverance, Jim survived a gunshot wound to his head. But that's not what made him great. What made him a hero was what he did with his life from that day forward. Jim had every right to be bitter. He'd worked all his life to get to the pinnacle of his profession. And before even getting settled into his fancy White House office, it was all taken away. His rehabilitation was beyond painful. That was nothing compared to the frustration of relearning the most basic things we all take for granted. While he did growl from time to time, the ""Bear"" was never bitter. His reaction was just the opposite. He turned his own pain and tragedy into a positive, working every day to make the world a little better, a little safer for all of us. Jim became the lead campaigner for gun control in our country. If you've been watching this debate at all in America, you know there is nothing tougher politically than getting sensible gun safety measures through our toxic political system. Many have talked about it, given speeches, run ads and used celebrity to highlight the issue. Working with leaders like President Bill Clinton and Sen. Chuck Schumer, Jim -- and his not-so-secret-weapon wife Sarah -- got it done. Pure and simple, he accomplished the politically impossible. The man who made people talk about guns . That is why in 2000, late in the administration, President Clinton decided to rename the briefing room in honor of James Brady. It was a small gesture, symbolic for most. But for the men and women who stand behind that podium it is very real. It reminds each of us that every time we step up to that microphone we should hold ourselves to the highest standard of all.

"(CNN) -- Amazon unveiled a collection of new Kindle devices in Santa Monica, California, on Thursday. There were two dedicated e-readers and three Kindle Fire tablets, ranging in price from $69 to $499. After Chief Executive Jeff Bezos finished his presentation, journalists were given some hands-on time with the new devices. Here are our first impressions: . 7-inch Kindle Fire HD and Kindle Fire . There are a few new members of the Kindle Fire family, one at every popular tablet price point. There are two new 7-inch devices, the $159 Kindle Fire and $199 Kindle Fire HD. Bezos also announced a pair of higher-end, faster Kindle Fire HD devices, both 8.9-inches, but they were not available for a demonstration. The 4G model costs $499, the regular model $299. The two 7-inch Fire tablets look similar, but the HD has a few more features. Available in 16GB or 32GB, the Kindle Fire HD has a higher resolution screen of 1280-by-800 pixels, Dolby Digital Plus powered speakers, stronger Wi-Fi and better battery life. It also manages to weigh a smidgen less than the Kindle Fire. Kindle HD vs. iPad: A comparison . The exterior designs are slick and minimalist, similar to the new Nexus 7, featuring a black body and no buttons. Photos, videos and books all look great on the HD's glossy screen and very nice on the Kindle Fire's screen. Navigating on both devices is a snap. The operating system is a heavily reworked version of Android, custom-made by Amazon. An oft-repeated theme at the event was that Amazon is focusing on the service, not the gadgets. It hopes to make money from its rich ecosystem of content, not the sales of hardware. The company makes no secret that the Kindle Fire is essentially a tool on which the company would like to sell you things, which is why the blatant attempts to point you toward new purchases don't feel so much intrusive as, well, helpful. For example, turning the device into portrait mode makes room for custom suggestions. Below the icon for an app is a selection of apps other customers also bought. Same for a book or movie. If you're looking at the thumbnail for a website, you'll see other sites that are ""trending now."" This soft sell is also present in the new X-Ray feature for movies, which allows you to hit pause and automatically see IMDB profiles for actors in the flick, finding out what else they've appeared in. This list of other movies is great for settling arguments, and you can also click to buy them from Amazon or add them to your watch list for future purchasing. Crafty. Amazon announces new wave of Kindles . One very interesting new feature just for the Kindle Fire is Immersion Reading, which allows you to listen to the audiobook version of a title, while the corresponding words are highlighted in the Kindle version. This would be great for learning a language or for kids who are just learning how to read. An update to an older feature, Whispersync for Voice, combines the two versions, so you can switch between listening to and reading a book without losing your place. Unfortunately, you will need to purchase both versions of the books individually to take advantage of the tools. Speed still appears to be an issue on the the 7-inch Kindle Fire HD. After tapping on an app or a photo, there's a bit of lag time before you're taken to your destination. It's the same if you flip too quickly through a magazine or book. This came up on the Kindle Fire HD and the Kindle Fire across a variety of apps and media. It wasn't noticeable while streaming videos, which played smoothly and looked crisp and seamless on both devices. The Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD will start shipping on September 14, and the 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HDs will ship on November 20. Kindle Paperwhite . It may not be the most expensive or feature-filled product announced Thursday by Amazon, but the Kindle Paperwhite could be the most impressive complete package. One of the most persistent complaints about the E-Ink Kindle has been that it lacked a light. For people who were used to using smartphones in the dark, the Kindle was a little too much like a real book. The Kindle Paperwhite addresses that problem with what the company calls a ""front-lit"" display. The result is rather stunning. The effect is subtle, more of an all-over soft glow than a bright computer, tablet screen or a directional light. When you first look, you might not even notice it's on, just that the text looks cleaner, crisper and easy on the eyes. The light is meant to be left on at all times, but the brightness should be adjusted depending on how much light you need. Even in a bright environment, the light greatly improves how text displays on the screen. One of the Kindle's biggest advantages over traditional tablets as an e-reading device is its impressive battery life. Amazon claims that even with the new light on, the Kindle Paperwhite will get up to eight weeks of battery life. The visual improvement extends to the touch screen, which has a higher resolution, 212 pixels per inch. And the background has been tweaked to be whiter, the text blacker. The Paperwhites were on display in a brightly lit airplane hangar, so it was difficult to see how the light would look in a dark environment. The screen is the real star, but the outside has a few changes as well. There are no buttons anymore, and the body is black and thinner than the Kindle Touch. Tapping the screen to advance to the next page could take a bit of getting used to for those of us accustomed to buttons on the sides of older Kindles. There are some nice changes to the user interface that solve small problems. A time is now displayed at the bottom of the screen telling you how much reading time is left for a book. If you encounter a character in a book and can't remember who they are, the new X-ray feature pops up again to lend a hand. The tool will show you everywhere else the person's name has appeared in the book, chapter or page. The improvements aren't drastic or flashy, but they are small changes that show a company paying attention to how its customers use the product and trying to perfect the user experience. The Kindle Paperwhite costs $119, or $179 if you opt for the 3G version. It ships on October 1. Kindle . The biggest change for the bare-bones Kindle e-reader is its price, which was dropped from $79 to $69. The mono-tasking device is the cheapest in the Kindle lineup, and it is the most similar to a paper book -- inexpensive, light, with an E-ink screen but no lighting. There are a few very minor changes to the ad-supported device. The body of the Kindle is now black instead of gray, but the buttons and ports are all in the same locations. There are some new font options, and the company claims it has 15% faster page turns. The new Kindle is available to order now and starts shipping on September 14.","The new Kindle Paperwhite e-reader features a ""front-lit"" light that is subtle and stunning .

"(CNN) -- Hashtags are coming to Facebook to help users better surface conversations. Support for the all-but-ubiquitous topic organization system was rumored in March and will roll out to a small percentage of users Wednesday. Facebook will roll out hashtags to more users in the coming weeks. The social network wants to make it easier for users to find content already on Facebook, and functional hashtags are the first step. According to Facebook, many users already post hashtags anyway, so why not make them work? Hashtags will be both clickable and searchable, so, for example, topics like #NSALeaks or #NBAFinals will now exist. SEE ALSO: 20 Things Your Most Annoying Friends Do on Facebook . Hashtags from other services, such as Instagram, are clickable as well. Users will also be able to compose posts directly from a hashtag feed and search results. That could make adding real-time content to specific streams easier than before. Twitter user Chris Messina created in 2007 the hashtag as we know it today. Twitter eventually adopted the system of organizing tweets around a certain subject into its API and its broader ecosystem. Since then, the hashtag has been adopted by other services, including Flickr, Tumblr, Google+ and even Facebook-owned Instagram.

"(CNN) -- News that Microsoft has sunk $300 million into a venture with Barnes & Noble sends a clear signal that the computing giant and the bookseller aim to shake up the e-book market with new ammo in their fight against Amazon and Apple. But whatever impact the move has on sales of B&N's Nook e-readers now, it's the future of the partnership that has truly disruptive potential. The Nook's considerable catalog of books and other content could become more formidable when married with products like Microsoft's forthcoming Windows 8 operating system -- which is designed to run on tablet computers -- and even its leading game console, the Xbox. ""Microsoft has not successfully gotten outside of PCs in any way other than the Xbox,"" said James McQuivey, an analyst with Forrester Research who studies both e-readers and Microsoft products, including the Xbox. ""Now, if you have the best game console in the world and the highest penetration of a PC operating system in the world and an OK platform for tablets, you really do have an interesting play that Microsoft has stumbled into."" Early versions of Windows 8 have received largely positive reviews. Several electronics companies are said to be building tablets to run the system. But content is king. And with Barnes & Noble's book offerings cooked into Windows 8, it could put the system in the same league as Apple's, which has incorporated iTunes into virtually all of its products. ""This is a key way of getting more content on to the Microsoft platform,"" Ingrid Lunden wrote for TechCrunch, ""specifically e-books content to ensure that its Windows 8 tablets will be able to compete not only against the best-selling iPad but also the Kindle Fire from Amazon, along with the rest of the company's e-readers."" According to Monday's announcement, Microsoft's $300 million is buying a 17.6% stake in B&N's Nook products and books, which are being split off from the company's brick-and-mortar stores. Currently, Amazon has more than 60% of both the e-book and e-reader market, McQuivey said. Estimates suggest that Amazon, which tends to be stingy with announcing its sales figures, has sold more than 20 million Kindles, including at least 6 million Kindle Fire tablets. McQuivey says the Nook has probably tallied less than half that. A Barnes & Noble representative declined Monday to comment on sales figures, saying only that the company has sold ""millions"" of Nooks. ""What's happening right now is, Amazon is walking away with that business, because Amazon already has the book buyer at a critical point: their website,"" McQuivey said. ""Amazon has almost a chokehold. ... The only way to get around that is if you happen to be a Barnes & Noble customer or you're in the Barnes & Noble store."" What a merging of Nook products and the new Windows 8 operating system could do, he said, is ""try to get you before you even go to Amazon."" The Microsoft deal might not have a huge impact on sales of current devices, according to McQuivey. But it sets the table for a future in which a Nook tablet, running Windows 8, could marry content from PCs with content from the Xbox game console and other devices. Adding at least one tablet to its Nook lineup (McQuivey predicts multiple devices with different-sized screens) would put Barnes & Noble more on par with Amazon, which has had more success with its $199 Kindle Fire than any other would-be competitor to Apple's iPad. ComScore says the Fire is the top-selling tablet running Google's Android operating system, with more than 54% of that market in the U.S. The second-place device, the Samsung Galaxy Tab, comes in at about 15%.

"(CNN) -- If you view a tablet as a guilty pleasure, like I do, then buying the Kindle Fire should make you feel a little less guilty. Amazon's new device doesn't replace a computer for doing e-mail or composing documents, but it's a fun hub for personal entertainment. And at $199, Amazon has managed to greatly undercut the price of Apple's iPad, the dominant tablet, and still churn out a good product. Apple calls its iPad ""a magical and revolutionary product at an unbelievable price."" Consider now that for the iPad's $499 price tag, I could buy two Kindle Fire tablets and still have cash left over for downloading apps and movies. However, except for price the Kindle Fire falls short of the iPad in just about every category. The iPad's processor is faster; its software is more abundant, capable and polished; its storage space is larger; its screen is bigger; and its body is more slender. Still, the Kindle Fire is a good Wi-Fi tablet, and the price is fantastic. After testing the device this week, I found the Kindle Fire is the most impressive iPad rival among the dozens of tablets that have flooded the market this year. Other iPad competitors have not sold well, but the new Kindle will likely have a different fate. The Nook Tablet, which also came out this week but which I have not tested at length, costs $50 more and has weaker multimedia offerings. Amazon and Barnes & Noble are squaring off with a new line of inexpensive black-and-white e-readers, too. Yes, those are still around, and bookworms love them. Size, components and features . Many tablets are much faster and have more bells and whistles than the Kindle Fire, which doesn't have cameras, GPS or a microphone. (The latter is especially strange because even the year-old black-and-white Kindle has a microphone.) Unlike other tablets and e-readers, there also is no version of the Kindle Fire with cellular-data connectivity, meaning that would-be Web surfers are limited to areas with Wi-Fi. Forgetting for a moment about the guts inside, the Kindle Fire does not feel cheap. The back is rubbery and doesn't slip out of my hands. It's not ultra thin, but it's girth and weight makes it comfortable to hold for long periods of time, like a paperback book. Because the Kindle is significantly smaller than the iPad -- with a 7-inch-wide screen versus the iPad's 9.7-inch more boxy display -- it weighs about a third less. The built-in speakers sound OK and get about as loud as an alarm clock. There is also a place to plug in headphones. But the Kindle's battery loses a charger much faster than the iPad. I was able to surf the Web and play videos for several hours, but I found myself frequently searching for a charger after that. That Amazon skimped on some of the components becomes evident when swiping through menus, switching the screen's orientation or playing games, which can all be jerky at times. The split-second delays are even present when turning pages on a Kindle e-book, which should be the pride of an Amazon device. The lack of a microphone means no Skype or other Internet telephony programs. Browser and OS . Amazon's Silk Web browser has the features I'd expect and can play most videos found online. Amazon touts the browser's unique speed enhancements, but probably due to the device's lower-end components, it doesn't show. Web pages generally take a few seconds longer to load than on computers or other tablets. Also, I am somewhat uncomfortable with the idea that Silk, as a means of speeding up load times, sends information from every page I visit to Amazon's servers. This Kindle's operating system is based on Google's Android, but Amazon has changed it so extensively that I barely noticed the similarities. A setback to this approach is that Amazon did not include some basic features, like the ability to copy and paste text, or to quickly switch between running applications. But overall, the interface is attractive and neatly laid out. On the home screen, the top bar allows me to search for content on the device or search the Web with Google. Below that is a list of categories like news, books, music and apps. In the main area, I have a bookshelf that includes recently opened items or apps organized in a carousel, plus other shelves full of my favorites. Movies and e-books . Amazon's multimedia offerings are pretty extensive and have been available on other platforms for some time. The company runs the biggest e-bookstore and the second-biggest music download store. Many publishers offer their newspapers and magazines in the Kindle newsstand, but the Kindle Fire's small screen size is not ideal for reading, say, an issue of Bloomberg Businessweek or the New York Times front page. The built-in Amazon shopping app is well designed. Each Kindle Fire comes with a free 30-day subscription to Amazon Prime, whose primary perk (for $79 a year) is free two-day shipping on every item the company sells. The Prime membership also gives new Kindle Fire owners a taste of its Instant Videos service, which has 13,000 movies and TV shows available for streaming on demand. Tens of thousands more are available for purchase. For those who prefer Netflix, that company released a new version this week for the Kindle Fire and other Android tablets. But overall, Amazon's Appstore carries far fewer apps than Apple's online store and even Google's own Android Market. Developers are required to list their Android apps separately with Amazon. (Yes, the Kindle Fire does have ""Angry Birds."") A few bugs . The bare-bones e-mail client that comes with the Kindle Fire does not support Microsoft Exchange, which many companies use for their e-mail system. The app encourages users to download another e-mail program from the Appstore, but it doesn't specify which one to get. Holding the tablet upright and typing with my thumbs is fairly efficient, but the system occasionally doesn't register my taps right away if I type fast. I also ran into several bugs throughout the Kindle's software. Sometimes my Fire would crash for no reason, and other times, images would not show up in the gallery. Some third-party developers apparently did not account for Amazon not including volume buttons on the hardware, and so I had to adjust the volume from the settings menu activated by tapping the menu bar. These are issues that I expect will get fixed over time through software updates. The bottom line . The overall software experience is pleasant and integrated from top to bottom. I am never asked to punch in my credit card to buy things, which is convenient. When I first turned on the Kindle Fire, the software recognized who I am because it was already tied to my Amazon account. After a few clicks, I was set up without ever connecting to a computer to synchronize anything. The music I bought through the Amazon MP3 store and the books I've gotten through the Kindle Store were all ready to go. The iPad remains the superior tablet, and it's the closest I've found to replacing a laptop. But I wouldn't discount a less capable competitor. The Kindle Fire is a good entertainment device at a price that's truly unbelievable.","Amazon's Kindle Fire is a multimedia-heavy touchscreen tablet computer .

"(CNN) -- Japanese Wagyu beef is considered to be one of the best meats in the world; tender and succulent. Its cuts can sell for more than Â£250 -- and I haven't had the chance, or the cash, to try it. But for one couple, the premium delicacy was behind the decision to shift countries -- and change lifestyles. Martine Chapman and Mohsin Altajir, a husband and wife team, moved from Dubai to Perthshire, Scotland, to start producing the meat. Watch more: Distillery wants better export conditions . They'd made money in Dubai in international property during the boom years and got out before the market crashed. Then, Altajir told me, he ""played golf."" But Chapman was bored, and wanted a new challenge. Having tasted Wagyu beef in Australia, she decided farming the beef would be their new business venture. Watch more: Can cruise industry regain public trust . Luckily, sourcing the land wasn't a problem. Nor was money. Altajir's family owns bottled water company Highland Spring, and the 25,000 acres of land surrounding its base in Perthshire. After putting together a business plan, all they needed was the Wagyu. They looked to Australia, one of the world's largest producers of Wagyu beef, to source the cattle. The couple then began cross breed them with traditional Scottish pedigrees, such as Shorthorn and Angus. Read more: How the skies tell Head if business will be sunny or gloomy . That was October 2011. Nearly two years on, the business is expanding. The couple tell me they will have 1,500 Wagyu by the end of next year, heading towards 6,000 by 2020. They aim to be the world's biggest Waygu producer. But they're not just striving for quantity -- they are also focused on quality. Chapman tells me that's how they can ensure the business stands apart from other producers. Read more: Building learning blocks at LEGO school . To keep the cattle happy -- and ensure the beef tastes good -- they feed the herd with seaweed and Omega three. They cut the hay to a certain length so the cows don't have to chew too much. Lighting in the cow's sheds, I am told, ""is done properly."" In other words -- it's mood lighting. They're considering playing music too, so the cows feel relaxed. Chapman, who seems to know most cows by name, evens brushes them. They feed the Wagyu a special low energy concentrate, which costs $1,500 per animal per year. With straw, grain, labor and other costs, it's not a cheap business. But there's logic behind this unorthodox farming. This strict regime, similar to that of a yoga retreat, improves the quality of the marbling and the animals' fertility rates. Each animal can sell for more than $12,000, and with Michelin star chefs adding more Wagyu to their menus, this may just help entice other Scottish producers to start breeding the beef too.","Martine Chapman and Mohsin Altajir moved from Dubai to Perthshire, Scotland, to start producing the meat .

"(CNN) -- ""The Wolf of Wall Street?"" Give me a break. If you've been to the movies lately, you may have seen a trailer for a Martin Scorsese film with that name. It's the title of the first book in a two-volume memoir by former stock swindler Jordan Belfort, upon whom the film is based. The trailer appears to portray Belfort as a player in a small part of lower Manhattan that's become the world-famous icon of capitalism. It opens with dizzying shots of famous symbols such as the Wall Street sign and the bronze Charging Bull statue, a favorite photo backdrop for tourists. There's a hilarious scene with Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, hamming it up with one of his early mentors, played by Matthew McConaughey, at a window table in a restaurant with fabulous city views. You think Wall Street big shots might go there. And if you haven't caught on yet, the camera moves to Belfort on his yacht, which happens to be bobbing in a harbor with the World Financial Center in the background. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" might turn out to be great entertainment, which is what Hollywood is for. And maybe Belfort really did dock his 167-foot yacht near the Financial Center at least once before it sank in a Mediterranean storm. But don't fall for the scenery. As Nadine Belfort, his second wife, said during an argument portrayed in his memoir, ""My husband, the Wolf of Wall Street! It's almost too ridiculous for words."" For starters, almost all of Belfort's lucrative criminal career took place in a less glamorous locale than those opening scenes. After seven months in his first job in the securities industry, pitching stocks over the telephone for a genuine Wall Street-based firm, Belfort left there after stocks crashed in 1987 and headed east. His intention, he says in the memoir, was to bring ""my own version of Wall Street out to Long Island instead."" The Expressway to his schemes . To convey what Belfort's professional life in this ""version of Wall Street"" was really like, the film trailer should start with shots of Long Island Expressway traffic and segue to a scene in a Greek diner near Lake Success, Long Island, population about 3,000, near the border with Queens. Belfort's firm, Stratton Oakmont, was headquartered there. In his memoir, he says he had breakfast at the diner with another mentor three times a week. Employing hundreds of brokers, Belfort's Long Island version of Wall Street was a huge, infamous example of a type of thievery known as a ""pump and dump"" scheme. In the scheme's first stage, Belfort and his partner, Daniel Porush, secretly got control of stock in small companies that Stratton took public. Then Stratton brokers, working banks of telephones, called individuals throughout the United States, using scripts that included wildly optimistic predictions about how high the stocks' prices would go. When enough people had finally been fooled into buying the shares, the price really did rise as a result. Ignoring instructions from ordinary investors who wanted to sell, Belfort and other insiders cashed in at the peak, dumped all their stock into the market for a huge profit, and left the people they'd duped holding nearly worthless stock. Trying to impress potential victims, brokers at Stratton and many other so-called ""boiler rooms"" said they were calling from ""Wall Street."" In fact, their only real connection with Wall Street was that some of the stocks they sold were traded at exchanges there, and the boiler rooms' ""clearing firms"" (companies handling the mechanical details of stock trades) might be there. The tactic evidently worked. Altogether, individual investors, many of them retirees, were cheated out of about $250 million by Stratton Oakmont by the time regulators managed to close it in 1996. There was a book in 1929 called ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" based on a B-movie by that name about a fellow who cornered the market in copper. That helps me believe someone really did call Belfort that at least once. But during more than a dozen years following Belfort's story for Newsday, I never once heard him referred to as ""The Wolf."" Not by his friends, enemies or ex-employees, and certainly not by the legions of regulators trying to close him down. Joseph Borg, director of the Alabama Securities Commission, headed a long investigation of Stratton in the 1990s. He told me he hadn't heard it either. He thinks Belfort invented the ""Wolf ""nickname himself. ""I have to give him credit,"" Borg says. ""He's not stupid."" Not 'Wolf,' but something else ... A word I did often hear to refer to boiler-room operators was something farther down the food chain -- ""cockroach."" The brokers themselves used it. Belfort made it into a verb when he testified in the trial of Stratton's accountant years after Stratton closed. After it became obvious that regulators were about to shut Stratton down, he, Porush and some advisers decided to ""close Stratton's doors ... and cockroach,"" he said. In his memoir, Belfort explains what he calls the ""Cockroach Theory,"" saying it meant setting up satellite firms when regulators got close to a big boiler room, moving brokers there in batches and continuing to operate as before at the new location. For regulators, he wrote, closing a crooked brokerage suddenly became ""like stepping on a cockroach and squashing it, only to find 10 new ones scurrying in all directions."" It's a real pity that the ""Wolf"" movie trailer doesn't give you some idea about who these victims were. Decidely middle class, unsophisticated investors, they included Dorothy and Louis Dequine, 88-year-old Florida residents. They lost $252,000 in 1994 after a Stratton broker replaced their holdings with worthless stocks without authorization. Claude Stemp, a Vietnam veteran, lost $62,000 in a 1996 Stratton swindle, and had to take out a second mortgage on his house to afford care for his ailing mother. When he saw the fictional movie ""Boiler Room"" a few years later, Stemp said, ""I just about cried."" Many of the swindled await their money . Despite Belfort's lucrative movie and book deals, and earnings from a new career as a motivational speaker, many of these victims are still waiting for restitution. When Belfort was sentenced in 2003 to four years in prison, Judge John Gleeson ordered him to pay about $110.4 million to a victims fund, in installments equal to 50% of his monthly gross income, after his release from jail. If any major changes in his financial circumstances took place, the percentage Belfort had to pay could be adjusted up or down. After I asked for an update on the fund in early October, lawyers in the office of Loretta E. Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, replied that Belfort had only contributed about $11.6 million to the victims' fund so far -- about one-tenth of the required total. In a court filing with many details about Belfort's current income whited out, Lynch's office asked Gleeson to find Belfort in default, saying that according to his tax returns and other available information, the payments he has been making are ""insufficient."" They said that in 2011, for instance, Belfort paid $21,000 in restitution, although he made more than $1 million for the motion picture rights to his memoir, as well as more income from a motivational speaking corporation he half-owns. Belfort's attorneys responded that he doesn't deny he still owes money to victims, but that his position is his obligation to pay 50% of his income to them ended when his term of ""supervised release"" from prison expired in April 2009. They said that for the past two years, he's been trying to arrange a ""forbearance"" agreement with the government to ""pay 100% of the profits of the movie and the two books,"" but that his offer has been turned down. ""Before you accuse me of anything, you should learn the facts,"" Belfort said in an e-mail last week. ""I have been trying to settle this case forever and have been completely stonewalled. I can even show you the settlement offer from the government, on their letterhead, asking for only 50% of my books, after I offered 100%."" On Friday afternoon, the government asked to withdraw its pending motion to hold Belfort in default on his payments to victims. Oral argument in the case had been scheduled to begin Nov. 22. In a court document, Beth Schwartz, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said the delay would give both sides ""an opportunity to explore a resolution"" of certain issues, and that ""Mr. Belfort joins in this request."" The movie, originally scheduled for mid-November, is now set for release on Christmas Day. Meanwhile, the website for ""Jordan Belfort's Wolf of Wall Street Sales Training,"" his motivational speaking company, features a video of DiCaprio doing a bit of speaking himself. ""There is nothing quite like Jordan's public speaking and his ability to train and empower young entrepreneurs,"" DiCaprio says. ""Jordan stands as a shining example of the transformative qualities of ambition and hard work, and in that regard, he is a true motivator."" Enjoy the show.

"(CNN) -- Update: In July 2014, Breanna Bond, 12, competed in the Junior Olympics in the 50-, 100-, 200- and 400-meter freestyle events. She has lost a total of 79 pounds. She and her mother have also written a book about their experience and childhood obesity that will release in 2015. Heidi Bond was desperate. No matter how much she cajoled or threatened her daughter, the 9-year-old refused to finish their workout. Used to this struggle, Bond pushed harder, encouraging Breanna to complete the four-mile loop. She had already lost weight, Bond reminded her. She couldn't give up now, or her hard work would be for nothing. Breanna ignored her mother and turned for home. Watching the 173-pound girl walk away, Bond's heart sank. She realized this was a fight she wasn't going to win in a war she couldn't afford to lose. Reality check . As reports of the childhood obesity epidemic hit home, parents around the country are struggling to figure out how to help their kids lose weight. About 12.5 million children 2 to 19 are obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That extra weight can lead to serious health problems, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and psychosocial issues such as peer discrimination or poor self-esteem. ""Parents are in a really tough position,"" says Dr. Elissa Jelalian, a staff psychologist at the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center who focuses on the development of intervention programs for children. ""They feel they are not doing a good job as parents if their child is struggling with weight. ... Parents see the potential health consequences, but kids aren't in tune with that."" Bond understands that frustration well. As a baby, she says, Breanna had a hearty appetite, and her parents joked that she would grow up to be like her dad -- a 6-foot, 200-pound man. By the time she was a year old, Breanna weighed close to 25 pounds. Bond asked their pediatrician whether she should be concerned, but he assured her Breanna would grow into the weight. Over the next few years, Breanna packed on the pounds. In preschool, she was bigger than any of the other kids in her class. Her parents hired a nutritionist, but the healthy habits didn't stick. They brought their daughter to a psychologist and an endocrinologist; both said Breanna's test results were normal. Breanna joined a dance class and a swim team, but her weight continued to climb. ""Kids teased me,"" Breanna says. ""They called me chubby and fatty-o."" ""It was horrible for me and my husband,"" Bond remembers. ""We felt helpless. We honestly didn't know what to do."" Kids race to finish their first triathlon . Their family was not one for a lot of fast food, soda or sugary treats. Bond cooked dinner most nights: fried chicken, roast beef, enchiladas. But the large meals, combined with a lack of physical activity and the junk food Breanna ate at school, continued to create a big problem. ""Imagine going through life and carrying around seven sacks of potatoes,"" Bond says. ""That's what it's like for these overweight children. It's taxing on their hearts, organs. It's hurting them tremendously. And society isn't helping."" At 9, Breanna weighed 186 pounds. Red light, green light . Conversations about a child's weight can be fraught with psychological landmines, says Dr. Denise Wilfley, director of the Weight Management & Eating Disorders Program at Washington University School of Medicine. ""Mainly what we suggest is actually having the whole family take on a healthier lifestyle -- for everybody to eat as well as possible, as nutritiously as possible, so the overweight child is not singled out,"" she says. Wilfley encourages parents in her programs to ""walk the walk"" and be a role model for their children. She talks about food as energy for kids' bodies -- eating better will help them think harder, jump higher, play more. Her families try to follow the traffic light diet, with green-light foods such as vegetables, yellow-light foods such as lean protein and red-light foods such as sweets or simple carbohydrates. ""We focus a lot on not defining self-worth by the number on the scale,"" she says. ""The best way to prevent eating disorders is having very healthy eating patterns."" Bond realized that in order to get Breanna to exercise regularly, they would had to make it a family activity. The Bonds started walking four miles, four days a week, on a trail near their home in Clovis, California. ""It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do,"" Bond says. ""There were times where she refused to move."" But in the end, ""a little tough love to save the rest of their life"" was worth it, she says. Why is it so hard for kids to lose weight? It's best to avoid a power struggle when it comes to exercise and healthy eating, according to Jelalian. She says it's easy for parents to become the ""food police"" without getting at the deeper issues. Parents should ask why a child wants a certain food or doesn't want to work out and problem-solve with them to find a healthy alternative. She recommends parents give their kids a choice as much as possible -- not about being active or not active, but about what activity they want to do. ""It really takes that balance in parenting of being firm -- this part is not negotiable, but being warm, caring in how you do that."" Identifying your child's motivation for losing weight is key, Wilfley says. Do they want to be able to run faster? Play football? Avoid teasing at school? Combining that goal with incentives such as sleepovers or family outings should help to keep a child motivated. Game on: Shaquille O'Neal vs. diabetes . Wilfley says it's also important to remove temptation from the house. Keep healthy snacks such as raw vegetables and hummus around; avoid buying chips, soda or other junk food. ""Don't expect yourself to have willpower. Most of us don't,"" she says. ""That's just the way we are. That takes some of the shame and blame out of it."" Fitting in . Breanna and her mother now work out at least an hour and 15 minutes every day. Breanna has also joined a swim team, a competitive cheer team and a basketball team to stay active. ""Sometimes my body just says, 'Lay down, I don't want to do it,'"" Breanna says. ""My mom keeps me going."" As of this week, Breanna had lost 65 pounds and is down to 121 pounds -- 6 pounds from her goal weight. At that point, the Bond family will switch to ""maintenance mode,"" where healthy eating and staying active will continue to play a big role in their everyday lives. Breanna has told all her friends about her weight loss plan, and they've been amazed by the results. One even joined her workouts over the summer and lost 20 pounds. ""I was inspiring,"" Breanna says, sounding slightly in awe. Kids at school have stopped teasing her, and her self-confidence has soared. ""It's changed her whole life,"" Bond says. ""She's able to be a kid for the first time.""","CDC: Approximately 12.5 million children from 2 to 19 are obese .

"(CNN) -- A large super typhoon is gathering force as it barrels along a path that is expected to take it close to the Japanese island of Okinawa. By the time it nears Okinawa early Tuesday, Super Typhoon Neoguri is likely to be generating winds as strong as a Category 5 hurricane, meteorologists say. ""This is a beast,"" said CNN International Meteorologist Tom Sater. Okinawa, where multiple U.S. military facilities are situated, regularly finds itself in the path of big typhoons. Many of the buildings on the island are designed to weather the powerful winds that come roaring in off the Western Pacific. Based on current predictions, Neoguri is expected to pass to the west of Okinawa, sparing the island its full fury. ""It'll brush Okinawa -- maybe Category 1, Category 2 winds,"" Sater said. ""But they're ready for that."" Most powerful in 15 years . Authorities at Kadena Air Base, the largest U.S. military installation in the Asia-Pacific region, aren't taking any chances. ""I can't stress enough how dangerous this typhoon may be when it hits Okinawa,"" Brig. Gen. James Hecker, the Commander of the 18th Wing, said Sunday on the base's Facebook page. ""This is the most powerful typhoon forecast to hit the island in 15 years."" He advised those on the base to secure outdoor items and prepare supplies. ""This is not just another typhoon,"" Hecker said. ""If we all follow the typhoon procedures and take care of each other, we will all make it through this typhoon safely."" The Joint Typhoon Warning Center projects that by Tuesday, Neoguri could be producing sustained winds as strong as 165 mph (265 kph) with gusts as powerful as 200 mph (320 kph). It could stir up waves as high as 39 feet (12 meters), the center predicted. The Japan Meteorological Agency on Monday issued an emergency warning for the region around Miyako Jima, a small Japanese island that lies between Okinawa and Taiwan. The agency warned of high waves and a storm surge. Seen from space . Astronaut Reid Wiseman in the International Space Center tweeted a dramatic photo over the weekend of the typhoon viewed from above, showing vast bands of cloud spiraling out from its center. ""#Typhoon Neoguri nearing Japan. Takes up our entire view. Wow,"" he wrote. After passing near Okinawa, the typhoon is expected to weaken somewhat as it moves on toward the Japanese mainland. But it could still be producing strong winds late Wednesday when it's forecast to hit Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's main islands. ""It's still going to really pack a punch,"" Sater said. ""This is a massive storm."" The typhoon is also expected to bring torrential rains with it to Kyushu. ""They've already had heavy amounts of rainfall in the past 24 hours,"" Sater said. ""So a saturated ground with a system moving in is going to cause some issues.""

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- An explosion late Tuesday ripped through a soccer viewing center showing a World Cup match in northeastern Nigeria, police and residents said. The incident occurred on the outskirts of Damaturu, in Yobe state, the sources said. The explosives had been concealed in an abandoned motorized rickshaw outside the center. People were watching the Brazil-Mexico match. ""Our men have deployed to the scene, but it's too early for us to give details,"" said Yobe state police Commissioner Sanusi Ruf'ai. Volatile northeastern Nigeria is the home of the notorious Boko Haram group, the militant Islamists who abducted scores of schoolgirls in April. Maina Ularamu, a local official in Madagali, in Adamawa state, told CNN last week that people in the town, which has been the target of previous Boko Haram attacks, had been warned against watching World Cup matches. ""Letters have been distributed to viewing centers in Adamawa state warning people not to gather to watch the World Cup games,"" she said. ""We suspect these letters to be from Boko Haram militants.

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI said Thursday the Catholic Church is ""profoundly and irrevocably committed to reject all anti-Semitism."" Pope Benedict XVI's meeting with Jewish leaders comes on the heels of controversy. The pope was meeting American Jewish leaders at the Vatican on the heels of a controversy over Holocaust denial. Last month the Vatican lifted the excommunication of a rebel bishop just days after the broadcast of an interview in which he denied the existence of gas chambers and said no more than 300,000 Jews had died in Nazi concentration camps. Scholars have in fact documented approximately 6 million Jewish deaths in the Holocaust. The Vatican has since ordered the bishop, Richard Williamson, to recant, and has said the pontiff was not aware of Williamson's views on the Holocaust when the excommunication was lifted. The excommunication was not related to Williamson's views on the Holocaust. On Thursday, Benedict XVI talked about his own visits to the sites of some concentration camps. ""The hatred and contempt for men, women and children that was manifested in the Shoah was a crime against God and against humanity,"" the pope said, using the Hebrew word for the Holocaust. He also reiterated his commitment to the groundbreaking Catholic rejection of the centuries-old claim that the Jews killed Jesus. ""Nostra Aetate marked a milestone in the journey towards reconciliation, and clearly outlined the principles that have governed the Church's approach to Christian-Jewish relations ever since,"" Benedict said. Jewish reactions to the pope's speech were broadly -- but not uniformly -- positive. ""Catholic-Jewish relations are on track,"" said Rabbi Arthur Schneier, head of the American Jewish Congress and a Holocaust survivor, who was among the community leaders at the meeting with the pope. ""We may have some setbacks, but when you have that strong bond of trust and friendship... Then we can face every challenge that comes our way."" The head of Israel's Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem, also praised the pope's statement. ""Yad Vashem places importance on the Pope's unequivocal statement condemning Holocaust denial and any attempts to minimize the scope of the Shoah,"" said its chairman, Avner Shalev. ""The Church's clear public denouncement of all types of anti-Semitism, during his meeting earlier today with American Jewish leaders, is to be welcomed."" But Abraham Foxman, the head of the Anti-Defamation League and another Holocaust survivor, said the Vatican had to match its words with deeds. ""To condemn the anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial and to reinstate into the Church a bishop who is an anti-Semite and an Holocaust denier does not end the issue,"" he said. And he urged the pope to expel Williamson from the Church again. ""Every day this man continues to remain a cleric, a bishop in the Church, is an insult to the memory of all these survivors and victims and to the Jewish people,"" Foxman said.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan forces came under fire Tuesday during a funeral for victims of a weekend rampage blamed on a U.S. soldier, while protesters angered by the killings blocked a major highway in the country's southeast. The U.S. military says the Army sergeant blamed for the killings acted alone. Two senior military officials told CNN that images from security cameras around his outpost showed the suspect leaving the base alone and returning alone. In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said American officials were ""heartbroken"" by the deaths but have no plans to change course in the decade-old war in Afghanistan. Sunday's predawn rampage, which left nine children, three women and four men dead in two villages in rural Kandahar province, has added to the strain between Washington and Kabul. Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Tuesday that the killings ""caused great pain for the people of Afghanistan,"" Taliban insurgents have vowed to avenge the killings, and gunshots and grenades echoed in the distance as the victims were buried Tuesday. ""While we were in the village of Alokozai for a funeral, praying for a martyr killed in the massacre, we heard close-range, small-arms fire, followed by two rocket-propelled grenades,"" said Haji Agha Lali, a member of the Kandahar provincial council. ""According to my information, two to three Afghan security forces have been injured."" Lali said high-level Afghan officials, including Karzai's brother, a minister and a deputy minister, were attending the funeral when the attacks took place. The targets appeared to be Afghan investigators collecting evidence in the neighboring village of Najibian, where the remaining victims died. The Taliban have battled U.S. and NATO troops, as well as Afghan government forces, since the 2001 invasion after the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. After Sunday's killings, they described U.S. troops as ""sick-minded American savages."" In a new statement Tuesday, they said they would take revenge ""by killing and beheading Americans anywhere in the country."" A protest in Jalalabad, near the border with Pakistan, drew hundreds of people Tuesday, with demonstrators blocking the highway to Kabul, provincial government spokesman Ahmad Zaii Abdulzai said. The highway was reopened later Tuesday. The still-unidentified soldier blamed for the attack has yet to be charged. He turned himself in to his fellow Americans after the killings and could face the death penalty, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said. Afghanistan's parliament has demanded a public trial for the suspect, but U.S. officials said they will handle the investigation and prosecution themselves. Gen. John Allen, the commander of NATO's International Security Assistance Force, said Monday that the suspect is believed to have acted ""as an individual."" He has invoked his right to remain silent and was not cooperating with investigators, U.S. and ISAF officials have told CNN on condition of anonymity. The officials have described the suspect as a staff sergeant from an infantry unit assigned to support Special Forces troops in Kandahar province, the Taliban heartland and a leading focus of the U.S.-led counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. Military authorities have presented a determination of probable cause to allow them to keep the sergeant in detention, an ISAF offficial told CNN. Tuesday, two senior military officials told CNN that security cameras monitoring the perimeter of the outpost showed the sergeant leaving the outpost alone and returning alone. Investigators are looking into whether alcohol may have been a factor in the attack, though toxicology tests on the suspect were not complete, the officials said. Alcohol was found on the outpost in the area where the suspect was housed, but it was not clear whether it belonged to the sergeant, one of the officials said. Speaking at the White House, Obama said he has told Karzai that the United States ""takes this as seriously as if it was our own citizens and our own children who were murdered."" ""The killing of innocent civilians is outrageous and it's unacceptable. It's not who we are as a country and it does not represent our military,"" he said. A U.S. military investigation ""will follow the facts wherever they lead us, and we will make sure that anybody who was involved is held fully accountable with the full force of the law,"" he added. Allied combat troops are scheduled to leave Afghanistan by 2014, and Obama said the number will be reduced by more than 30,000 by summer's end, matching the number of Americans he sent in after taking office. ""There's no question that we face a difficult challenge in Afghanistan, but I'm confident that we can continue the work of meeting our objectives, protecting our country and responsibly bringing this war to a close,"" he said. Mark Jacobson, a former official with the NATO command in Kabul, said the reaction to Sunday's massacre may not force a shift in allied strategy, but could cause ""an increase to the pace of transition."" But the demonstrations have been muted compared with the deadly riots that followed the disclosure that American troops had burned copies of the Quran -- mistakenly, their commanders said. ""Not to be callous in any way, but the Afghans are in some ways used to the civilian casualty incidents and tend to respond to it in a more reserved manner than something that seems to be a direct and personal affront to their religion and culture,"" Jacobson said. In other incidents adding to the strain on U.S.-Afghan relations, U.S. commanders condemned a video of a squad of Marines urinating on bodies in January, and several soldiers -- from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state, like the suspect in Sunday's shooting -- were charged with taking part in a rogue ""kill squad."" As he set out Monday for a trip to the region, Panetta said the United States and its NATO allies ""seem to get tested almost every other day."" But, he added, ""It is important that, all of us, United States, Afghanistan, the (NATO-led) forces all stick to the strategy that we've laid out."" ""War is hell,"" he said. ""These kind of events and incidents are going to take place. They've taken place in any war. They're terrible events. This is not the first of those events, and they probably won't be the last."" The suspect in the attack served three tours of duty in Iraq before being deployed to Afghanistan, Allen said. During the suspect's last deployment, in 2010, he was riding in a vehicle that rolled over in a wreck, according to a senior Defense Department official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. After the wreck, the sergeant was diagnosed with traumatic brain injury but was treated and then found fit for duty, the official said. CNN's Chris Lawrence, Barbara Starr, Jethro Mullen and journalist Ruhullah Khapalwak contributed to this report.","Security cameras show the suspect leaving and returning alone, officials say .

"(CNN) -- As the 10th anniversary of al Qaeda's attack on the United States approaches, Taliban militants struck a coalition base in Afghanistan on Saturday, killing one person and wounding 10 others. The truck bombing occurred in the central-east province of Wardak and all of the casualties were Afghan laborers, the Wardak governor's spokesman said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. NATO's International Security Assistance Force confirmed the attack was carried out by a Taliban suicide bomber. The attacker was driving a truck carrying firewood and detonated his explosives at an entry point to the base, ISAF said in a statement. ""Most of the force of the explosion was absorbed by the protective barrier at the outpost entrance and though there were a significant number of injuries ... none is immediately life threatening,"" the statement said. The attack comes as Gen. John R. Allen, commander of coalition and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, spoke about the 9/11 anniversary and the long war, saying that while ""there is still much work to be done"" in the fight against Taliban militants, ""we will prevail."" Allen delivered remarks in a video issued Saturday by ISAF and praised the troops from the 49 nations serving in the ISAF coalition. The protracted war began just a month after the al Qaeda terror network, sheltered at the time by the ruling Taliban militants, attacked the United States on September 11, 2001. U.S.-led forces kicked off Operation Enduring Freedom in October and ousted the Taliban. Ever since, coalition and Afghan troops have been fighting the tenacious Taliban militants in the Afghan-Pakistani region. Allen noted that ""September 11 marks the 10th anniversary of an event that changed the world."" Ever since that day, he said, the troops have crippled insurgents  and have honored the victims of terrorism worldwide. He said the coalition is committed to making sure Afghanistan is never again a safe haven for al Qaeda. ""You have helped the Afghan people build their nation, a democratic government and an ever-strengthening security force,"" he said, saying Afghanistan has made advances in security, economic development and governance. Allen's remarks come as ISAF reported five more troops dying in combat Friday. Three died following an insurgent attack in the east. Two died in separate incidents in the south, one following an insurgent attack and another after a bombing. Their nationalities have not been released, and the precise locations of the incidents were not disclosed. They are among 12 service members who have died in Afghanistan this month. Of the others, five are Americans, one is Danish and another is French. The coalition death toll in the war is nearing 2,700, according to a CNN count, with the United States sustaining most of the casualties in Operation Enduring Freedom. August was the deadliest month for U.S. forces in Afghanistan since the conflict began. Seventy-one American troops died in August, topping July 2010, when 65 troops died, according to the CNN tally. Many deaths took place on August 6 when insurgents shot down a helicopter in the eastern central province of Wardak. Thirty U.S. service members -- including 17 Navy SEALs -- were killed in that attack, the single largest loss of life for U.S. troops since the Afghan war began in 2001. The Taliban claimed militants downed the helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade. The surge in U.S. deaths comes as NATO is drawing down and handing over security control to national forces. Some 10,000 U.S. troops are scheduled to depart by year's end, with all U.S. military personnel out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Also, Afghan and coalition troops killed several insurgents on Friday during a search for a Taliban leader in Logar province, ISAF said Saturday. The leader is responsible for roadside bombings on Afghan forces. During the operation, insurgents armed with AK-47 assault rifles fired on the forces. The soldiers returned fire and killed them. Logar's government spokesman also said the bodies of six road construction workers were found Friday night. They had been kidnapped on Wednesday and killed by the Taliban, Den Mohammad Darwish said.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's foreign minister says an apology by the U.S. government for the NATO airstrike that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers would not satisfy the Pakistani government, and the attack demanded a reassessment of Islamabad's partnership with the United States. ""The incident was grave enough for an apology not to be good enough,"" said Foreign Minster Hina Rabbani Khar in a wide-ranging interview with CNN at her home in Islamabad. ""This did require a complete relook at the terms of engagement with the United States of America."" In November, U.S.-Pakistan relations plunged to an all-time low when NATO fighter jets attacked a Pakistani checkpoint near the Afghan border, killing 24 Pakistani soldiers. The U.S. government expressed regret over the incident but has yet to issue a direct apology. The NATO airstrike was the latest in a string of incidents that increased tensions between Islamabad and Washington, including the killing of two Pakistani men by a CIA contractor and the U.S. decision to raid Osama bin Laden's compound in Pakistan without notifying Pakistani authorities. But it was the NATO airstrike that put some of the most crucial aspects of U.S.-Pakistan relations on hold. Soon after the incident, Islamabad boycotted a conference on the Afghan peace process in Germany and shut down supply routes used to transport NATO supplies from Pakistan's port city of Karachi to Afghanistan. This week Pakistani lawmakers are set to debate and vote on terms of re-engagement with Washington. The conditions include charging fees for NATO goods transported through Pakistan, an end to U.S. drone strikes on Pakistani soil, and an ""unconditional apology"" for the deadly NATO airstrike. Khar said the new terms could help mend U.S.-Pakistan relations and restore the trust and respect that have eroded between the two countries. ""We were partners for the past 10 years. Did we get the respect that a partner deserves? A partner which has lost many lives, a partner which has had huge economic costs? I think we must look at this relationship in a more realistic, in a more pragmatic manner, rather than a philosophical manner."" Pakistan's first woman foreign minister, and the nation's youngest ever, added that Pakistan is prepared to play a ""crucial supportive role"" in the Afghan peace talks. Khar rejected claims that Islamabad has links to Mullah Omar and can persuade the Afghan Taliban leader to take part in the negotiations. ""If what you're trying to get out of me is if we have links to Mullah Omar or not, the answer to that is no,"" said Khar. Washington and Kabul view Pakistan as a crucial player in the Afghan peace talks because of the perception that Islamabad maintains ties to the leadership of the Afghan Taliban. ""I think that the perception of what Pakistan is able to do is blown out of proportion most of the time,"" said Khar.","Deadly airstrike forced complete review of Pakistan's relations with U.S., foreign minister says .

"(CNN) -- Leave the wife alone. Many of you should admit it. You think there's ""something suspicious"" about her. You're not alone. The police say they have ""barely scratched the surface"" on the investigation into Cooper Harris' death in a hot car, and a lot of us have decided that Leanna Harris, his mom, was somehow involved. At the time I'm writing this, she has not been charged with a crime, she is not a suspect, she is not the focus of the investigation -- she's just one of the many witnesses being scrutinized by the police, as she should be. But she shouldn't be indicted by the public before the facts come out. It's tempting to rush to judgment in a tragedy. We tend to make a gut call and then use the details in a story to try to prove that our initial call was right. I agree with those who are skeptical: The sexting dad Justin Ross Harris, who left the boy in the car, appears to have dug himself a pretty deep hole. Until we hear his side of the story, he'll probably remain there. But before you judge Leanna Harris, consider these eight points. Her emotional state is irrelevant. Interpreting emotional reactions is an extremely subjective business. Justin Ross Harris was crying in court during the probable cause hearing, yet nobody is arguing that his tears are proof he made a mistake. Many have pointed out Leanna's stoic, gum-chomping face in court as ""suspicious."" Try this interpretation. She's pissed. Listening to evidence that your husband was sending photos of his penis to other women isn't going to send most women into tears, she's probably chewing the gum to keep herself from standing up and throwing something at him. Perhaps that's what she meant when, as police say, she asked her husband ""Did you say too much?"" It might refer to saying too much about their marital problems and financial difficulties that were playing out in court. And more important: Everyone grieves differently. Police questioned her lack of emotion and an officer testified that Leanna Harris' mother asked her ""Why aren't you crying?"" I can tell you why she's not crying: She's in shock. She is emotionally and mentally processing a lot. Her baby is dead. She is learning the horrible details about how Cooper suffered: scratching his face and banging his head against the seat as he slowly died. Her husband is in jail for murder. Her husband was also sexting with several women. Her marital and financial troubles have been exposed for the world to see. The world media is parked at her front door and filming her every move. How is she supposed to act in the wake of that avalanche? Lord only knows. I'm sure she's a hot mess of rage, fear, grief, shock and everything in between. Her Internet searches about hot car deaths mean nothing. Thousands of things new parents do might strike the rest of us as strange: they buy fabric inserts for shopping carts because they are germophobes, they boil every bottle, throw out pacifiers that drop on the floor. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a mother searching for information about a subject she's worried about. After hearing about Cooper's horrible death and  that 44 children died last year in hot cars, you might have searched for information about it. I know I did. ""I love you Ross, I'm doing this for you."" At first that statement during her eulogy seemed really strange. What exactly is she ""doing"" for him? But look at the context. She called him a ""wonderful father"" and is clearly standing by him. She stood up there in front of 250 people with her son in a tiny casket and had the strength to give a eulogy on behalf of both of them. She talked about how much she loved Cooper, about God, about Cooper being in ""the most peaceful, wonderful place there is"" and about how she was relying on her faith to give her strength. I refuse to believe the accomplice theories. You can convince me that an individual might be sick enough to kill his or her spouse and child to run off with a mistress, but the idea of a couple trying to fix their marital problems by killing their child strains belief. A life insurance policy is not definitive proof of motive. Plenty of families have life insurance polices for their children and owning one is not a de facto motive for murder. In the Harris case, the $2,000 policy was issued by his employer and the $25,000 policy was purchased in 2012. And even if Leanna Harris cashes it in, as her husband has been instructing family members to do, it doesn't prove she was involved in Cooper's death either. It just proves they've got very poor judgment on timing. But on the other hand, I'm sure the lawyer bills and other expenses are adding up and she has to pay for them somehow. And finally, her statement at day care: ""Ross must have left him in the car. There's no other explanation."" At first blush, that statement seemed suspicious, then I thought of two things: One is mother's intuition. The other is that we don't know yet if Ross had said anything to her that day, even something as cryptic as ""Sorry."" The other day, my husband and I were at home and it was 12:30 in the afternoon. Both our cellphones rang at the same time. It was the school calling. We were in a meeting, so we let it go to voicemail. Then the home phone rang: It was the school again. I turned to my husband Chris and without thinking said, ""Pick it up, I bet there's a lockdown at the school."" Sure enough, two first graders had seen what they thought was a man with a gun -- the school was in full lockdown and Swat teams were on site. A school shooting is my worst nightmare and I had just connected the dots unconsciously. Leanna's ""worst nightmare"" was leaving her son in the car -- did she just connect the dots? I have my theories, as many people do. One day, I think Ross Harris made a tragic mistake. When you cheat on your wife, you lead a double life and that means you are even more distracted than most frazzled working parents. So distracted that you might forget your kid in the back seat as you race into work to start sexting. If he did leave Cooper in the car by mistake, he could have realized it in the afternoon and just couldn't face what he had done. He might have panicked all afternoon -- so much so he convinced himself that getting in the car and driving to a crowded parking lot would make it look like an accident. But then, I learn about some new detail in the case -- the Internet searches he made about #childfreelife and ""surviving prison"" and I mutter ""I hope they fry him."" The truth is ... I don't know the truth. Only Ross Harris does. And although it is easy to speculate about the wife's involvement, let's all leave the lady alone. Until I hear all the evidence I will just continue to look at the legal issues and analyze them -- because I don't actually know what happened yet, and neither do you.","Mel Robbins: People say there's ""something suspicious"" about Leanna Harris .

"(CNN) -- Would the United States extradite Amanda Knox to Italy, where an Italian court found her guilty Thursday of murdering Briton Meredith Kercher? U.S. officials may never have to decide, a legal expert said Saturday. ""I think we have a hint from Italy that they may not seek her extradition,"" Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz told CNN ""New Day Saturday."" ""Look, they let her go back to the United States, even though the case was then pending, knowing that it would be very difficult to get her back in Italy, so the Italian government may be satisfied with convicting her and then letting her spend the rest of her life in the United States -- not able to travel to Europe or to Italy, so it may resolve itself that way."" Still, if the conviction is upheld on appeal, if there are no clear violations of due process and if no new compelling evidence is submitted, the case should be treated routinely, Dershowitz said. In other words, Knox should be treated an ordinary person, the Harvard law professor added. And if an extradition request is made, the United States would likely comply, according to Dershowitz. ""The Italian legal system, though I don't love it, is a legitimate legal system and we have a treaty with Italy so I don't see how we would resist,"" he told Agence France Presse. Citing privacy and confidentiality concerns, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf declined to say whether Italy has requested that Knox be extradited. Knox and her former boyfriend, Italian Raffaele Sollecito, were found guilty Thursday of the 2007 murder of Kercher. Prosecutors say Kercher was held down and stabbed after she rejected attempts by Knox, Sollecito and another man, Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, to involve her in a sex game. Guede is in jail for the killing. In the conviction, which reversed an earlier appeal judgment, Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years in prison; Knox, who is a student at the University of Washington and did not attend the trial, was sentenced in absentia to 28-1/2 years. Knox lawyer Theodore Simon told CNN on Friday that his client has received ""an incredible outpouring"" of support, and that the evidence against his client was non-existent. ""There is absolutely no evidence today, there was no evidence before and there never will be any evidence of her guilt,"" he said. Asked whether he believes the U.S. government would honor an extradition request from Italy, if one were issued, Simon noted that at least one appeal and other legal issues remain before that would be an issue. ""It's really not a question that is an issue today or tomorrow or for a long time to come,"" he said. ""It's really not right for consideration, and I wouldn't comment on that at this time."" CNN Legal Analyst Paul Callan agreed that there is a long road ahead for Knox. ""More time for her hair to grow out,"" said Callan, who also appeared on ""New Day Saturday."" ""She is sporting a new hairdo, I don't know if you noticed that yesterday, in what I think is a public relations effort to sort of humanize Amanda Knox and keep that high public opinion poll that out there for her."" That public opinion has been shaped by largely positive media coverage of the case in the United States, according to Dershowitz. One example of apparent media sympathy, if not support, is a photograph published Saturday in the New York Times showing ABC Anchor Robin Roberts holding the hand of the 26-year-old convicted murderer. ""We wish you the best, going forward,"" Roberts told Knox at the end of a teary interview. ""I don't know why public opinion is so supportive of her innocence,"" said Dershowitz, who described the circumstantial case against Knox as compelling, though not overwhelming. ""This is not a case, as it's been projected in the media, of no evidence at all. It's a case of the kind that would have resulted probably in a conviction in most courts in America. And so yet, because she is attractive, and because she has created a media campaign all over the country, she's become very popular. And I don't think we should do justice by popularity or justice by the way a person looks. This is a case for extradition."" The victim, he said, has largely been ignored by the American media, which has been supportive of Knox. ""In Italy, it's exactly the opposite. In Italy, she's Al Capone, she's the worst murderer in history."" Kercher's brother, Lyle, told reporters on Friday that he expected Italy would file an extradition request if the Supreme Court upholds Thursday's ruling by the lower court. ""In as much as, yes, if somebody's found guilty -- and this would go for anybody -- if somebody's found guilty and convicted of a murder."" He added, ""I don't see why they wouldn't."" Dershowitz told CNN last March that, if an extradition request is made and Knox somehow avoids being sent back, ""she remains a prisoner in the United States, because Interpol will put a warrant out for her and, if she travels anywhere outside the United States, she'll be immediately arrested and turned over to Italy.""","""I think we have a hint from Italy that they may not seek her extradition,"" law prof says .

"GAZA-ISRAEL BORDER (CNN) -- From a distance, smoke rises over Gaza. It is about as close as most reporters can get to the battle zone. The world's media have been camped on the Israeli border with Gaza. Israel's media restrictions have prevented dozens of international journalists from entering Gaza, where the Jewish state is waging an operation against militant targets. International news media are forced to report on the more than two-week-old conflict from a hill near the Gaza-Israel border. CNN relies on a local journalist in Gaza, but cannot send other reporters into the Palestinian territory. In addition, Egypt is also not allowing journalists to cross its border into Gaza. ""It's really frustrating, you can't be there, see there and feel it,"" said CNN's Nic Robertson. ""And you see these pictures from the hospital, but what's happening behind the hospital? What's Hamas doing?"" Israel has accused Hamas militants of exploiting the deaths of civilians to garner international sympathy through the media. Robertson pointed out that allowing reporters into Gaza would give the world a more thorough picture of Israel's military operation. ""The questions we would ask that go beyond the immediacy of the civilian casualties that you want to know about, but the other stuff that really informs you,"" he said. It is a very different strategy from Israel's position during its 2006 war against Hezbollah militants in Lebanon. Then, reporters were allowed to broadcast from Israeli artillery positions. But this time, Israel has changed its tactics and is preventing international reporters from being embedded with the military to avoid interference in military operations, an Israeli government spokesman said. ""There was too much exposure,"" Daniel Seaman said. ""It had an effect on our ability to achieve strategic goals, so that's one of the lessons we learned from the war in Lebanon."" Some Israeli journalists are embedded with the military in Gaza but are not allowed to report from elsewhere. The Tel Aviv-based Foreign Press Association -- of which CNN is a member -- is among several groups that have criticized the restrictions. ""The unprecedented denial of access to Gaza for the world's media amounts to a severe violation of press freedom and puts the state of Israel in the company of a handful of regimes around the world which regularly keep journalists from doing their jobs,"" the association said in a January 6 statement. John Ging, the head of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in Gaza, said the absence of journalists is preventing the truth from getting out. Herve Deguine, a spokesman for the Paris, France-based Reporters Without Borders, said the dangers of the current conflict do not override the need for media coverage. ""Of course it's a dangerous place, of course journalists have to take the responsibilities and have to decide whether they want to go in or not and where they want to be,"" Deguine said. ""But banning the press to enter Gaza is just unacceptable."" Almost two weeks into the operation, Israel did allow a western camera crew across the border. But footage shot by the BBC crew was subject to clearance by Israeli military censors. Images from inside Gaza did filter out to the world from journalists based inside Gaza who work for news agencies such as Ramattan and broadcasters like Al-Jazeera. Inside Gaza, Hamas has controlled the images broadcast by the media, and pictures of suffering have been encouraged. But the outside world has seen very few images of Hamas fighters or their rockets being fired into Israel. Both the Israeli military and Hamas have launched pages on the Web site, YouTube. Israel Defense Forces says the shared video is ""documentation of the IDF's humane action and operational success in Operation Cast Lead."" Hamas' video shows graphic scenes from the fighting and also attacks its political rival, Fatah. In times of war, the line between winning and losing can come down to the public relations battle as much as the military offensive itself. But for journalists, it's about finding a balance in the story -- a difficult task when they are unable to cover all the angles.","Israel's media restrictions have prevented journalists from entering Gaza .

"(CNN) -- When President Barack Obama stands in front of Congress Tuesday for the State of the Union Address, he will likely talk about his new focus: ""income inequality."" But why, five years into the Obama administration, does the President and his political advisers want to change the topic and focus on this new theme? Well, probably because Obama does not want to talk about job creation. In 2009 the President promised that if the American people took on another $800 billion in higher debt and spent that $800 billion through the government, it would ""create or save"" 3.5 million jobs over the next two years and unemployment -- then 7.3% -- would not go higher than 8% (it ended up peaking at 10%). After all that spending, the United States had the weakest recovery since World War II. The percentage of Americans of working age who are actually working was 66% when the recession began, stood at 65.8% when Obama was inaugurated and actually fell to 62.8% today. The only reason the unemployment number has appeared to fall from 7.3% since Obama took office to 6.7% now is that 10 million Americans of working age have left the workforce out of frustration at not finding work. So creating jobs would be a rather unpleasant topic for the President. And America has just marked the 50-year milestone in the ""War on Poverty,"" announced by President Johnson in 1964. After $15 trillion in government spending, poverty remains as high as when the war was declared. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have been shorter and less expensive in dollars. So ""income inequality"" is a much less unpleasant topic than ""why government spending did not create permanent jobs"" or ""why massive welfare spending didn't fix poverty."" Before Obama promised we could keep our doctors and health care if we wanted -- which he now admits was a fib -- the Democrats promised that government spending would create real jobs and welfare would end poverty. One might have noticed Detroit as a storm petrel or dead canary in the coal mine. But rather than learn from 50 years and five years of failure, President Obama wants to change the subject. Governments can reduce income inequality. You simply weaken the middle class and tax or regulate or inflate away the earnings of the highest-paid Americans and, without making any single person or family or community better off, you have reduced income inequality. The grinding poverty of the Middle Ages had great income equality. Even the kings didn't have indoor plumbing or electricity. No one had life extending health care. Mao's China gave us another prolonged period of great income equality. The frenetic first days of the French Revolution reduced income inequality by lopping off the heads of the aristocracy -- the political bosses of the day. The minimum wage is a perfect tool for denying the youngest workers and those with limited skills trying to enter the workforce from getting that first job. By killing jobs at the first rungs of the economic ladder, existing businesses cannot grow as rapidly, new workers do not get training and experience to move ahead. So everyone gets hurt and we are more equal in our reduced standard of living. Lose, lose. Republicans have already countered by insisting that the President cannot hide the failure of Obamacare with distracting speeches. Some might point out that Envy is one of the deadly sins, not a political program worthy of the American people. But most importantly the Jack Kemp wing of the modern Republican party has found new leaders in Congressman Paul Ryan and Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio. They have presented programs for getting government out of the way of job creation, upward mobility and general prosperity. Americans should not let Obama change the topic. He can't distract us from why his party's promises that government spending would create jobs and that welfare would create hard-working, successful Americans and that Obamacare would allow every American to keep the health care he or she once had. Those failures must be discussed, however painful to the politicians who made those failed promises, so that we learn from failure and move to the opposite. It is past time to make a U-turn on the present path where we have long ago passed the road sign that blared ""warning, this way leads to Detroit.""

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The Moammar Gadhafi loyalists who had been holding journalists in Tripoli's Rixos Hotel for five days ""essentially just capitulated"" upon realizing that most of the rest of the city had fallen to rebels, CNN's Matthew Chance said after his release Wednesday. Their release ended what some were beginning to fear was a hostage situation for the three dozen journalists who had been kept inside the blacked-out hotel as fighters loyal to the National Transitional Council fought their way into the Libyan capital. Chance, a senior international correspondent for CNN, said ""the reality slowly dawned"" on their guards that Gadhafi's government was collapsing. ""They really believed that Gadhafi was coming back, that he was beating the rebels,"" Chance said after his release. ""That's what the government line has been on this all along."" But as the rebels advanced through the city and overran Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound on Tuesday, ""It became more and more obvious that there was nothing really outside of the hotel that was in Gadhafi's control."" Wednesday, the guards handed over their weapons and told the journalists, ""We're going to let you go,"" Chance said. The release was coordinated through the International Committee of the Red Cross, which, along with the BBC, provided cars to drive them out. CNN producer Jomana Karadsheh said the men who held them ""really did not know what the scenes on the streets of Tripoli were like."" Shortly before the guards gave up, she said, one guard asked a companion, ""You were out there -- tell me, what's really going on? Is it what they are telling us?"" Chance called the experience a ""nightmare,"" saying the journalists wept with relief after their release. The ""die-hard Gadhafi loyalists"" who held them thought they were NATO spies, he said. On Tuesday, one shouted ""I suppose you're happy now that they're killing Libyans,"" he said. The reporters had been bandying about ""all kinds of paranoid scenarios"" about what would be done to them, like being used as human shields or executed ""by some lunatic hard-liner,"" Chance said. But in the end, all were released unharmed. ""Everybody's been hugging each other,"" Chance said. ""People who have been living cheek-to-jowl for the past five days, sleeping in the corridors, wondering whether we were going to make it -- it's all very emotional,"" he said. iReport: Are you in Libya? Share photos . Chance had described on Twitter the process of going free, piling into a car with other journalists, and driving away from the hotel that had become a virtual prison.

"(CNN) -- Two Russian bombers have landed at a Venezuelan airfield where they will carry out training flights for several days, the Russian defense ministry said Wednesday. Russia's Tupolev TU-160, pictured here in 2003, is a long-range strategic bomber. The Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers landed at Venezuela's Libertador military airfield and ""will spend several days carrying out training flights over neutral waters, after which they will return to the base,"" the ministry added. NATO fighters followed the bombers on their 13-hour flight over the Arctic Ocean and the Atlantic, the defense ministry said. It said the Russian flights were carried out in strict accordance with international rules governing airspace above neutral waters, and that the aircraft did not violate the borders of other states. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said such joint exercises between nations are not unusual. ""We exercise all around the globe and have joint exercises with countries all over the world. So do many other nations."" The U.S. will monitor the Russian-Venezuelan training, said Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified as they are not authorized to speak on the information. On Monday, Russia announced it might hold joint naval maneuvers with Venezuela in the Caribbean. The declaration came amid increased tension between Russia and the United States over Russia's invasion last month of the former Soviet republic of Georgia, a U.S. ally that aspires to join NATO. On Monday Russia denied any link between that announcement and the conflict in Georgia, although Russia has criticized U.S. support for Georgia. Russia has also objected to the missile defense system agreement, signed between the United States and Poland and the Czech Republic in August, that places a ground-based ballistic defense facility in the two eastern European nations. Russia has said the deal threatens its security, while the United States has said that the system is to guard against rogue states such as Iran. Earlier this month, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, whose comments have frequently antagonized Washington, said it would welcome the Russian air force, according to Russian news agency Novosti. ""If Russian long-range bombers should need to land in Venezuela, we would not object to that either. We will also welcome them,"" Chavez said on September 1, according to Novosti.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An Afghan police officer shot and killed nine other officers in southeast Afghanistan on Thursday night, authorities said. The incident occurred in Paktika province, a spokesman for the provincial governor said. Two police officers were arrested, and another, believed to be part of the attack, fled, the spokesman said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said in a statement that the officer who fired the shots was actually a Taliban fighter. The shooter was a member of the Afghan Local Police force, International Security Assistance Force spokesman Maj. Joe Buccino said in a statement. Buccino described the officer as a ""rogue"" and said the attack was not preceded by any signs of trouble.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Taliban on Thursday rejected a United Nations report that blamed it and other insurgent groups for 76 percent of all civilian casualties in Afghanistan. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the report, released Tuesday, was part of a Pentagon decision to create a propaganda campaign against the Taliban, accusing the group of attacks on civilians. He said the campaign is aimed at turning the people against the Taliban, and he said the Taliban reject that. The United Nations representative in Afghanistan, he said, should stop this propaganda and any actions aimed at destroying the Taliban, and accept the reality on the ground. The U.N. report said the human cost of the Afghan conflict is escalating, with killings and attacks on children by the Taliban and other insurgent groups soaring. Afghan children and women are increasingly bearing the brunt of the conflict, being killed and wounded in their homes and communities in greater numbers than ever, said Staffan de Mistura, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general. In the first six months of this year, 55 percent more children were killed or wounded by the Taliban and other anti-government groups than in the same period in 2009. The number of women killed or wounded by the Taliban and other insurgents increased by six percent. From January 1 to June 30, 2010, the UNAMA Human Rights Unit documented a total of 3,268 civilian casualties, including 1,271 deaths and 1,997 injuries. Anti-government forces were responsible for 2,477 casualties. That is 76 percent of all casualties, up 53 percent from 2009. Pro-government forces, including the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Afghan security forces, were responsible for 386 civilian casualties, 12 percent of all casualties, down from 30 percent in 2009, the report said.","The Taliban reject s U.N. report this week on Afghan casualties .

"(CNN) -- At the Eslam Ghalah crossing on the Afghan-Iranian border, millions of dollars have been spent by the international community to try to ensure that all goods and human traffic entering and leaving Afghanistan can be controlled and accounted for. But we found a very different reality. We had traveled from the city of Herat in out to Afghanistan's western border to film a story on the smuggling of weaponry to the Taliban from Iran - we wanted to get a sense of how much was being done to block the smuggling trails along the Iranian border -- an area of remote mountain trails and passes. The local security commissioner had insisted we take a police escort. Once we had finished filming at the official crossing I asked the commander of the detail if he knew where the main smuggling trail across the border was as I'd heard it was just outside of Eslam Ghalagh. He agreed to take us and we climbed back into our cars. Less then five minutes later we turned off the main road onto a dusty track. Another five minutes and the police car leading the way came to a halt - we were less than 10 kilometers from the official crossing and we'd arrived. It was the best known smuggling trail, but just one of many hundreds of trails that snake through the mountains here. Afghanistan's border with Iran is around 1,000 kilometers long. There is no doubt that it's one of the most difficult in the world to police. But all the Afghans we spoke to were adamant that while the Iranians are deadly serious about blocking the drug trade into Iran from Afghanistan, they are much less rigorous about the traffic in weapons in the other direction. And the sources we spoke with - Afghan, Taliban and Western - believe that is a matter of policy. But it's far from clear at what level in the Iranian government -- if any -- the arms shipments are organized or approved. For their part, the Iranians strenuously deny involvement in the smuggling. The Embassy in London told me: ""These allegations are fabricated to pervert attentions from the problems and damage created by foreign forces in [Afghanistan.""] . Getting people to talk about the smuggling on camera was almost impossible. It's no overstatement to say that many Afghans in Herat are scared of their powerful neighbor to the West. Nearly everyone who gave us information did so on condition of anonymity. Several of the officials we interviewed happily gave us access to their records and reports but as soon as the camera was switched on the stock response was that they were not authorized to comment. On our last day in Herat we finally were given access to the evidence store where the weaponry seized along the border was kept. The source helping us had to resort to locking us in his office after smuggling an Iranian mine out of the store room so we could film it. It was same kind as those used by the Taliban in roadside bomb attacks. Later that day, a very senior contact in the Afghan security services gave us access to the Afghan police's evidence file. Although the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan has made numerous statements about Iranian weaponry and training being provided to the Taliban the Afghan government has remained largely silent. In Herat the provincial authorities have spent the last two years filming every weapon haul they've intercepted coming over the Iranian border, photographing serial numbers written in Persian and establishing which models are produced in Iranian state armament factories. If the Afghan government decides to take up the issue with Tehran, they'll find all the evidence they need here in Herat.","Large network of trails used to smuggle weapons found at Iran-Afghan border .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- Raw satellite data about missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be released Tuesday, a Malaysian official said Monday. Malaysian acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein made the comments about the data from satellite company Inmarsat as he toured a newly constructed terminal at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Families of the passengers on board the plane, which disappeared in March over Southeast Asia while carrying 239 people, have been demanding that the raw data be made public. The fate of the plane and those on board has become one of the great aviation mysteries of modern times. Inmarsat, the company whose satellites communicated with the missing plane in its last hours, had said it didn't have the authority to release the data. But last week, Inmarsat and Malaysian authorities said they were trying to make the raw data accessible. ""In line with our commitment towards greater transparency, all parties are working for the release of the data communication logs and the technical description of the analysis for public consumption,"" Inmarsat and the Malaysian aviation officials said in a joint statement. Publication of the raw satellite data could allow for independent analysis of what happened on March 8, the day the Boeing 777 veered sharply off its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and dropped off radar screens. Analysts have said the data could help discount some theories about what happened to the jetliner, and potentially fuel new ones. Malaysia and Australia, the two countries at the forefront of the search, have said that an analysis by international experts of all the available information -- including the satellite data -- leads them to conclude that the plane ended up in the southern Indian Ocean. But months of searching above and below the surface of the ocean has so far failed to find any physical trace of the missing passenger jet. CNN's Saima Mohsin and Mitra Mobasherat reported from Kuala Lumpur, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.","Malaysian acting transport minister says the Inmarsat data will be made public .

"London (CNN) -- The days of would-be terrorists needing to travel to far-off camps to make contacts and learn how to build bombs is rapidly receding. Social media forums like Twitter and Facebook provide a ready made Rolodex of sources -- dig further online, mine those contacts further, gain admission to private chat forums and eventually you will find instructions for bomb making. Last month al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM) launched a Twitter account that has already gained more than 5,500 followers, and AQIM's account is following seven people including the Somali terrorist group Al Shabaab's official twitter handle and the al Nusra front in Syria, which in turn is following another rebel group in Aleppo. You can see how rapidly the connections start to multiply and how easy it is for a budding terrorist to build up global contacts. Of course, it is impossible to prove any of these accounts are authentic, but many of their followers think they are, which is worrying in itself. The British security service MI5 and its sister spy organizations GCHQ and MI6 all monitor social media, noting who is following whom on sites like Twitter, and providing vital information about alliances being forged between different groups and individuals. But Professor Peter Neumann from King's College London points out that it's not without its challenges. ""This is the big problem because Web 2.0, the social media generates so much 'stuff' and there are so many people involved in chatting with radicals on the internet and to monitor that would require really huge resources and no intelligence service has completely figured out how to separate the 'chatter' from the 'real,' significant stuff,"" he said. ""You don't know, for example, if someone who chats online a lot is very dangerous or whether it's the opposite -- someone who doesn't chat at all and is just listening is actually more dangerous because that person maybe more likely to be operational. There's a lot of the online environment that we don't know yet."" Jean Paul Rouiller from the Geneva Centre for the Training and Analysis of Terrorism says social media is vital to modern terrorist organizations. ""They would not have been able survive, they would not be able to recruit people. The human touch always needed, but social media is their shop- window,"" he said. Behind the shop-window of Twitter and Facebook accounts are more limited private chat-rooms where terrorist leaders from around the world exchange information and tactics. According to Rouiller, one notorious forum was run by French terrorist suspect Nabil Amdouni until it was closed down by the French, and who was arrested last summer in Toulon. Rouiller claims that documents recovered during the killing of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad suggest that bin Laden himself may have posted messages on this forum. The dead al Qaeda chief was very careful to stay away from electronic devices himself, but it is thought he wrote down messages on pieces of paper which a trusted lieutenant would then type and save on to a USB stick, finally passing this to someone else to post on the forum. There is also the case of another militant Moezeddin Garsallaoui who, Rouiller says, used to log into a chat forum after drone strikes to show his family in Europe that he had survived. He never posted a message, but his mere presence in the forum left an electronic signature that proved to his wife Malika al Aroud he was still alive. READ MORE: Who really killed bin Laden? Some experts think there are examples of terrorists who have immersed themselves in this online world of extremism and have ""self radicalized"" without ever having met another terrorist in real life. Major Nidal Hasan, who allegedly shot dead 13 people and injured 30 others at Fort Hood in 2009, is an example cited by analysts like Neumann, as a ""self-radicalizing"" terrorist . Authorities say he was in email contact with the Yemen-based preacher Anwar al-Awlaki in the months prior to the shootings, but because of the lack of a wider ""plot"" or conspirators, the Department of Defense has categorized the killings not as terrorism, but as workplace violence. READ MORE: Dead cleric inspiring new terrorists . Others though, like Rouiller, say that while online material can put an individual onto the wrong track, ultimately there is almost always a terrorist ""mentor"" who plays a key role in pushing someone towards violence and that mentoring almost always takes place face-to-face, in somewhere like a mosque, high school or university. The big question in light of the Boston bombings is whether the Tsarnaev brothers, suspected of setting the bombs, were also ""home-grown"", radicalizing solely online, or whether there was in fact a terrorist ""mentor"" that capitalized on their discontent and steered them towards violence. And crucially, if they are guilty, did they learn their bomb making skills from the Internet, rather than in a terrorist classroom in Dagestan? Analysis: The appeal of Islamic radicalism .

"Kandahar, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Plans to drive the Taliban from Afghanistan's second-largest city and surrounding districts will start only when the plans have the support of the population, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Monday. Karzai has told tribal leaders in the Kandahar region, the Taliban's traditional stronghold, that he would hold back the NATO offensive until he had their backing. His insistence on that support drew a fresh expression of frustration from the White House on Monday, but Karzai told CNN, ""We run this country,"" referring to the Afghan people. ""The operation in Kandahar will not begin, will not go on, unless and until we have the full trust of the people of Kandahar for it and we have the full approval of the people of Kandahar for it, and where we have made sure after they've given us the approval that this operation will bring them more security, better livelihood and improved governance,"" he said. Karzai has led Afghanistan since the U.S.-led invasion that drove the Taliban from power in December 2001. He was re-elected last year in a vote that international observers said was marred by fraud, and Karzai irritated the Obama administration Friday when he blamed the irregularities on foreigners who wanted a ""puppet government"" in Afghanistan. He further aggravated Washington, his biggest backer, on Sunday when he told a gathering of tribal leaders that the U.S.-led alliance would not move against Taliban fighters in Kandahar ""until you say we can."" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters Monday that Karzai's remarks were ""genuinely troubling."" ""It was disturbing Friday,"" Gibbs said Monday. ""Obviously, it didn't get better. ... On behalf of the American people, we're frustrated by the remarks."" Asked whether the administration has confidence in Karzai, Gibbs said, ""President Karzai is the elected leader of Afghanistan."" Karzai told CNN on Monday that his remarks should not have hurt his government's relationships with its allies. ""It's just to make sure that we all understand as to where each one of us stands,"" he said. ""Afghanistan is the home of Afghans, and we own this place,"" he said. ""Our partners are here to help, and we run this country."" The Obama administration has poured about 30,000 additional U.S. troops into Afghanistan since December, bringing the number of American troops to about 100,000. An additional 40,000-plus NATO troops are also in the conflict. Allied and Afghan troops recently retook the southern city of Marjah from the Taliban and have been expected to move on the Kandahar region in June. But at Sunday's meeting, in which Karzai was accompanied by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, most of the Afghan leaders were apprehensive about the operation. Gibbs said a planned White House visit by Karzai, scheduled for May, was still on ""as of now."" And McChrystal told CNN his partnership with Karzai ""has been something I've been pleased with and something I've relied on as we've moved forward in operations, and that's reflected in his people and his government that I've worked with.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Two billionaire brothers who control Asia's biggest property development company have gone on trial in Hong Kong's biggest ever corruption case. Sun Hung Kai Properties (SHKP) co-chairmen Thomas and Raymond Kwok were among five people charged with a total of eight offenses, including conspiracy to offer advantages to a public servant and misconduct in public office, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said in a statement. The two brothers are ranked 86th on the 2014 Forbes list of the world's richest people. Hong Kong's former chief secretary Rafael Hui, banker Francis Kwan and Thomas Chan -- responsible for land acquisitions for SHKP -- were the other men charged after one of the biggest anti-graft probes in the banking hub's history. Hui, previously the city's No.2, faces charges related to misconduct in public office, including the acceptance of rent-free apartments and unsecured loans -- he's the highest-ranking former official to face trial in the city. All five defendants plead ""not guilty"" to each of the charges. The ICAC revealed the offenses took place between 2000 and 2009 as investigators probed land sales overseen by Hui involving SHKP. The case has caused a media frenzy in the city, where real estate is a local obsession. Sun Hung Kai, which helped to build some of the tallest buildings in the city's celebrated skyline, contributed to the Kwok brothers' estimated $18.3 billion fortune. The brothers, who were arrested in March 2012, have always protested their innocence. ""I can say that personally I have done nothing wrong. And I can vouch for Mr. Thomas Kwok that he has done nothing wrong either,"" Raymond Kwok said at a news conference on April 2012, referring to his brother. ""I hope this investigation will clear my name,"" he said at the time. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, is considered to be one of the world's least corrupt territories. According to Transparency International's 2013 Corruptions Perceptions Index, Hong Kong is the 15th least corrupt territory in the world -- with the United States, by comparison, ranked 19th.","Property tycoons Thomas and Raymond Kwok in court on graft charges .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A wave of explosions across Baghdad killed dozens of people Thursday and spread fears that Iraq's government could collapse in the wake of the U.S. military's departure. At least 65 people were killed and at least 196 were wounded in 20 explosions just days after the final U.S. troops withdrew, police said. The attacks targeted civilians across all walks of life. One took place at a market. Another, at a school as children were arriving. A third was at a coffee shop. The attacks were a painful reminder of Iraq's most violent years. The seemingly coordinated explosions Thursday struck during the height of morning rush hour, hitting a number of Baghdad's primarily mixed Sunni-Shiite neighborhoods. Nine car bombs, six roadside bombs and a mortar round all went off in a two-hour period, targeting residential, commercial and government districts in the Iraqi capital, two police officials told CNN. Analysis: Bombings expose Iraq's deepening sectarian divisions . There have been no immediate claims of responsibility, though the attacks resemble previous bombings that have been claimed by both Sunni and Shiite insurgents as well as al Qaeda in Iraq. The deadliest attack was a suicide car bombing outside the offices of the Integrity Commission, the country's main anti-corruption body. At least 23 people were killed and 43 others were wounded in the explosion, which also damaged part of the building, police officials said. The violence comes as Iraq's Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish political leaders square off over a warrant issued for the arrest of Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi, who is accused of organizing his security detail into a death squad that targeted government and military officials. Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has demanded that Kurdish lawmakers hand over the Sunni vice president, who has denied the charges and refuses to return to Baghdad from northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Finance Minister Rafie al-Issawi told CNN he does not believe the violence is directly connected to the latest political developments, ""but there is a good environment for terrorists to be active in these bad circumstances."" Terrorists ""will justify their criminal activities"" and argue that the solution to Iraq's woes ""isn't in the political process,"" said al-Issawi, a member of the Sunni-backed Iraqiya minority political bloc. The head of Iraqiya, former Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, complained that the bombings ""reveal the weakness of the security and intelligence services to achieve security and stability because some of these services were busy chasing down political forces."" He accused those services of creating confusion in the political process, ""which is essentially broken."" Al-Maliki meanwhile, called on ""clerics, politicians, parties, tribal leaders and all the national groups to bear responsibility in this delicate situation, support the security forces and unify ranks."" ""The criminals and those who stand behind them will not be able to change the course of events and the political process or escape punishment that they will face sooner or later,"" he said. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad issued a statement condemning the attacks. ""We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families and communities of these victims,"" the statement said. ""It is especially important during this critical period that Iraq's political leaders work to resolve differences peacefully, through dialogue, and in accordance with Iraq's constitution and laws. Senseless acts of violence tear at the fabric of Iraqi unity and do not in any way help the people of Iraq or any of its communities. "" ]At the Medical City hospital in central Baghdad, doctors treated the wounded whose bodies were peppered with what appeared to be shrapnel from explosions. Images of bloodied, battered bodies and destroyed storefronts and homes were broadcast on Iraqi television stations. While violence in Iraq has fallen off in recent years, the latest spate of attacks are among the worst since August when a series of coordinated bombings killed at least 75 people in 17 Iraqi cities. The attacks come amid heightened sectarian tensions, raising fears that the political turmoil in Iraq could spark a return of sectarian bloodshed that nearly ripped the country apart during the height of the war. Al-Hashimi has denied the charges against him, saying the accusations are politically motivated amid the rivalry between his Sunni-backed Iraqiya minority political bloc and al-Maliki's Shiite majority bloc. The warrant for al-Hashimi's arrest was issued just days after Iraqiya suspended its participation in parliament, claiming it was being cut out of the political process by al-Maliki. The prime minister has said failing to hand over al-Hashimi or allowing him to flee to another country ""could cause problems."" Al-Issawi, the finance minister, told CNN that before U.S. troops left, Iraqi officials made clear their fears of what could happen. ""So many times we warned the Americans, both the political and security situation (are) very fragile. Unfortunately, no one listened."" In a speech this month about bringing the U.S. troops home, President Barack Obama said, ""Iraq is not a perfect place. It has many challenges ahead. But we're leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people. "" ""There can be no fuller expression of America's support for self-determination than our leaving Iraq to its people. That says something about who we are,"" Obama added. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, cited the latest violence in an interview Thursday with CNN's ""American Morning."" He complained that the president is ""spouting how we have left a stable and Democratic Iraq."" ""Unfortunately, what I anticipated is taking place,"" he said, adding that the United States should have maintained a ""residual force"" in the country.

""The vast majority of these tests show no indication of horse meat. However, there are also a few tests that do. In those cases we remove the product from sales,"" the company said. ""IKEA Group is committed to serving and selling high quality food that is safe, healthy and produced with care for the environment."" The test result from Russia concerns locally produced hotdogs and only affects the Russian market, Ikea said. The alert over the hotdogs has added to what has been a difficult couple of weeks for Ikea. What's behind the horsemeat contamination scandal? Ten days ago, the company suspended sales of its Swedish meatballs after testing in the Czech Republic revealed traces of horse DNA. Testing since has revealed the presence of horse meat in a few samples of Ikea meatballs from a supplier in Sweden, the firm said Thursday. Ikea also said Tuesday it was withdrawing its almond cake with chocolate and butterscotch from sale in 23 countries after traces of coliform bacteria -- organisms found in the environment and in the feces of warm-blooded animals and humans -- were found in two batches. The horse meat scandal has extended across Europe, with questions raised over slaughterhouses and food suppliers in a number of countries. The UK Food Standards Agency released the results Friday of the latest round of testing ordered on products labeled beef across the UK food industry. Horse: Coming soon to a meat case near you? So far, more than 99% of tests continue to show no horse DNA at or above the level of 1%, it said. Horse meat is not harmful in itself but authorities are concerned by its unauthorized presence in case it is tainted with a veterinary drug used to treat horses. Phenylbutazone, also known as bute, is not allowed to enter the food chain because it can pose a risk to humans. The European Union said last month it intends to begin testing meat across all 27 member states.","Ikea says horse meat has been found in hotdogs produced for sale in Russia .

"(CNN) -- The same day the man he fatally struck was laid to rest, NASCAR driver Tony Stewart's team announced that he won't be racing this weekend -- though it didn't rule a return to the track soon thereafter. In a brief statement, Stewart-Haas Racing said Thursday that Stewart ""has decided not to compete"" in Sunday's race in NASCAR's top division, the Sprint Cup Series. Jeff Burton will take his place in the No. 14 car in the Pure Michigan 400 at Michigan International Speedway. ""The driver change pertains only to Michigan,"" the Stewart-Haas Racing team said. ""Stewart's plans for upcoming Sprint Cup races have yet to be determined."" Stewart's future outside the track is also in question, as authorities investigate the death of fellow driver Kevin Ward Jr. at an August 9 Empire Super Sprints series dirt-track race in upstate New York. Video from the Canandaigua Motorsports Park race shows two cars coming out of a turn, with Stewart's No. 14 car sliding up the track toward Ward's No. 13 car. The two cars get close and appear to make contact before Ward's car hits the wall and spins out. Ward gets out of his crashed car and walks determinedly on the track toward the race cars, which had slowed for a yellow flag. Ward points a finger and appears to be yelling. One car swerves to avoid Ward on the half-mile dirt track. Stewart's car passes close to Ward, and it appears that its right rear tire hits him. Authorities announced two days later that 20-year-old Ward, a New York sprint car driver, had died of ""massive blunt trauma."" Ontario County Sheriff Philip C. Povero said that there was no evidence at that point that a crime was committed, adding that the investigation was progressing well. Some have speculated that Stewart -- who was interviewed after the incident -- could face charges. Even if authorities don't press charges, one person not convinced of Stewart's innocence is Ward's father. According to a story on Syracuse.com, Kevin Ward Sr. said that other drivers saw his son walking on the track. ""Apparently, Tony Stewart was the only one driving out there who didn't see him,"" the father said, according to the report. In the same story, Kevin Ward Sr. asked the world to remember his son as a talented driver who seemingly ""slept with a smile on his face."" Hundreds joined the Ward family to remember him Thursday at his funeral at South Lewis Central School. The mourners passed a row of bouquets to get into the school, some wiping away tears as they did. Afterward, people gathered outside to release balloons that were orange and white, Ward's racing colors. They then gave theracer one last round of applause, not because of his racing exploits but because of the young man he was. As family friend Ray Falk recalled to CNN affiliate WSYR, ""If you weren't laughing, he'd make you laugh."" Opinion: Why Tony Stewart isn't likely to face charges in racetrack death .

"(CNN) -- European leaders meeting in Brussels Thursday need to send Russia an unmistakeable signal that its military intervention in Ukraine will not be tolerated. The consequences of failing to act firmly would have a negative impact far beyond the European Union's eastern neighborhood. One country waiting quietly to see if Vladimir Putin gets away with his de facto land grab in Crimea is China, a growing military power locked in a series of territorial disputes with the countries around it. There is too much at stake for the lesson that borders can be unilaterally changed by force to be allowed to stand. An important starting point is for EU policy makers to understand that Russia acted out of weakness rather than strength. Faced with the loss of a friendly regime in his own back yard, Putin lashed out without any real thought for the consequences. There are already signs that he realizes he overplayed his hand. In his press conference on Tuesday, the Russian President stressed the limited and temporary nature of his goals, professed friendship towards Ukraine and even expressed sympathy for the protestors who overthrew his Ukrainian ally, Viktor Yanukovych. The reason for this is clear. Putin wants to rebuild his influence over Ukraine as a whole and recognizes that the occupation of Crimea is more likely to unite the country against him. A second factor giving him pause for thought will have been the reaction of the markets in weakening the ruble and wiping billions from the value of Russian businesses. Russia's economic difficulties were already beginning to mount before this crisis broke. Growth is stagnant and likely to remain so. Little progress has been made in modernizing and diversifying the economy despite years of talking about it. Net capital outflows from Russia run at tens of billions of dollars each year at a time when its investment requirement remains huge. Russia may find an ally in China . Even Russia's status as an energy superpower is now challenged by a combination of American shale gas and EU competition measures against Gazprom. Indeed, the only metric by which Russia remains strong is its ability to generate scary headlines in the western media. These vulnerabilities give the EU plenty of options for leverage over Russia if it chooses to use them. One important focus of attention should be on political and economic reform in Ukraine itself. Stabilizing the situation, providing economic aid and encouraging free elections to choose a new government should be immediate priorities. Assistance should also be given to help Ukraine realize its goal of energy independence from Russia. Work to allow the reverse flow of Ukraine's pipelines to import gas from west to east will increase supply options until measures can be taken to raise domestic production. Reviving and completing the EU's association agreement with Ukraine will be another important element. The aim should not be to shut Russia out. Ukraine and Russia have strong ties of history and culture, a fact still reflected in the preference of most Ukrainians for close relations between the two countries. The EU should be willing to talk to Russia about its interests in the region and the creation of a common economic space provided Russia ends its military intervention, restores friendly ties with Kiev and doesn't assume a right of veto over Ukraine's future. Influence has to be earned not asserted as an attribute of Russian greatness. If Russia won't be a good neighbor, the EU should help Ukraine to move on regardless. Targeted measures aimed at the financial and personal interests of the Russian elite will also help to focus minds. We know from the Kremlin's furious reaction to the U.S. Magnitsky act that this can be an effective instrument. Travel bans and asset freezes aimed at Russian officials who supported and facilitated the invasion of Crimea should be combined with a rolling program of money laundering investigations into Russian financial assets held in western banks. Action to restrict flows of western capital, limit technology transfer and toughen visa requirements would also hurt. Perhaps the most provocative thing western governments could do would be to remind Russia of what it potentially stands to lose by undermining the principle of territorial integrity in relations between states. Russia has been anxious about its own internal cohesion since the break up of the Soviet Union. In addition to concerns about Kaliningrad and eastern Siberia, Moscow faces open revolt in the northern Caucasus. Upgrading diplomatic contacts with non-violent opposition groups from these regions is a message the Kremlin would understand. So far the measures European leaders have been prepared to discuss fall far short of what is required get Russia's attention. The suspension of trade talks that were in any case going nowhere and even cancellation of the G8 summit come under the heading of gesture diplomacy. The Obama administration has been much tougher in thinking about the kinds of sanctions that are needed. With deeper ties of energy and trade, European leaders feel they have more to lose and are reluctant to endanger what remains a fragile economic recovery. But they risk far more if nothing is done in response to a grave violation of international law. Only a direct challenge to Russia's material and geopolitical interests is likely to have an impact on Putin's calculations. Anything short of that will amount to a wasted day out in Brussels.

"(CNN) -- What's almost 300 years old? Worth an estimated $6 million? And missing? Answer: A Stradivarius violin stolen from Frank Almond, concertmaster of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra. Almond was walking to his car after a performance Monday night when an assailant used a stun gun on him, causing him to drop the instrument. The attacker then took the violin and fled to a waiting vehicle, which was being driven by a second suspect, according to Milwaukee police. That vehicle was described as a late 1980s or early 1990s, maroon or burgundy, Chrysler or Dodge minivan. ""It appears at this time that the violin was the primary target of this assault and robbery,"" police said in a statement. ""It is important to note that this violin is valuable to a very small number of people in the world and is not something easily sold for what it is worth."" According to the symphony, Almond plays on a violin made by Antonio Stradivari from 1715, known as the ""ex-Lipinski."" CNN affiliate WITI reports that it's worth an estimated $6 million. A police spokesman declined to comment on the instrument's exact cost, instead putting it in the ""millions."" The Milwaukee police are working with the FBI's Art Crime Team, which specializes in high-end art thefts. The FBI team, in turn, works with Interpol to connect art dealers able to help locate stolen items throughout the world. Antonio Stradivari was born in 1644. He set up shop in Cremona, Italy, where he made violins, harps, guitars, violas and cellos. Before his death in 1737, Stradivari is thought to have made more than 1,100 instruments -- of which some 650 remain today -- according to the Smithsonian Institution. He is the world's most celebrated violin maker. Stolen Stradivarius violin found after more than two years .","The violin, made by Antonio Stradivari, dates to 1715 and is worth millions .

"(CNN) -- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said in an interview broadcast Sunday that the Justice Department's decision to review waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques is politically motivated. Former Vice President Dick Cheney criticized the review of interrogation methods. Cheney said he opposes the decision by Attorney General Eric Holder to ask a former prosecutor to review CIA interrogations of high-profile terrorism suspects. Cheney made clear he believes President Obama directed Holder to launch the review because the president is feeling pressure from left-wing Democrats. Cheney said the review will undermine the willingness of CIA personnel to conduct necessary operations. ""I think it's a terrible decision,"" Cheney said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""It's clearly a political move. There's no other rationale for why they're doing this.""  Watch senators spar over CIA probe » . He criticized Obama for allowing a review considering the president previously said that CIA operatives involved in the interrogations would not be prosecuted. ""I think he's trying to duck responsibility for what's going on here, and I think it's wrong,"" Cheney said. Holder has said the Justice Department would not prosecute intelligence officers that followed legal guidance from the administration ""in good faith."" Cheney also addressed the separate announcement last week that President Obama had ordered a special interrogation unit to be housed within the FBI. Cheney called that idea ""silly."" ""I think it's a direct slap at the CIA,"" Cheney said. ""I don't think it will work. I think that if they were faced with the kind of situation we were faced with in the aftermath of 9/11, suddenly capturing people that may have knowledge about imminent attacks, and they're going to have to have meetings and decide who gets to ask what question and who's going to Mirandize the witness -- I just -- I think it's -- it's silly. ""It makes no sense. It's not -- doesn't appear to be a serious move in terms of being able to deal with the nation's security,"" Cheney said. Also last week, a 2004 inspector general's report revealed interrogation methods, including U.S. interrogators threatening a captured al Qaeda operative with a power drill and an instance in which another threatened to kill a high-profile captive's children. The report, released as a result of a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, outlined the use of multiple unauthorized interrogation methods on suspected terrorists, including threats, ""blowing cigar smoke, employing certain stress positions, the use of a stiff brush on a detainee, and stepping on a detainee's ankle shackles."" Critics say some of the techniques that had been authorized -- such as the use of waterboarding -- violated international law. A primary question is whether the techniques led to suspects providing valuable information that prevented further terror attacks. No evidence citing a direct link has emerged. But Cheney said in the Sunday interview that the evidence was clear -- there has not been another attack on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001. ""I think the evidence is overwhelming that the enhanced interrogation techniques persuaded them to cooperate,"" Cheney said. ""How do you explain that? The critics don't have any solution for that. They criticize our policy, our way of doing business, but the results speak for themselves."" Cheney said the interrogation techniques ""were absolutely essential in saving thousands of American lives, in preventing further attacks against the United States, in giving us the intelligence we needed to go find al Qaeda, to find their camps, to find out how they were being financed."" The former vice president also said in the interview that he had approved waterboarding as a policy but was unaware of its use on specific individuals. ""I knew about the waterboarding, not specifically in any one case but as a policy we approved,"" he said. Cheney said he knew of a case cited in the newly released reports of a suspect being threatened with a gun and an electric drill. ""The fact of the matter is the Justice Department reviewed all those allegations several years ago,"" Cheney said. ""They looked at this question of whether or not somebody had an electric drill in an interrogation session. It was never used on the individual -- or that they had brought in a weapon, never used on the individual."" Although Holder said last week that the Justice Department would not prosecute intelligence officers that followed legal guidance from the administration, he also said that he has asked federal prosecutor John Durham to lead a preliminary investigation into the interrogations. Durham was appointed in 2008 by Holder's predecessor, Michael Mukasey, to investigate the destruction of CIA interrogation tapes. The interrogations took place in the CIA's secret prisons before 2006, when former President Bush moved all detainees from such facilities to the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba. The Bush administration has acknowledged that it authorized enhanced interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists, arguing they produced valuable intelligence without violating U.S. laws banning torture. On Sunday, Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts said he disagreed with Cheney. Holder is acting independent of the president, Kerry said on ABC's The Week. Holder's decision ""shows that we have an attorney general who is not pursuing a political agenda but who is doing what he believes the law requires him to do and we have an administration on the other hand that is balancing some of those other interests,"" Kerry said. Also weighing in on Sunday was Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, who spent more than five years in captivity and was tortured as a POW in Vietnam. McCain said he opposes further review of past interrogations. But the senator and 2008 Presidential candidate also noted on the CBS program ""Face the Nation"" that the enhanced interrogation techniques violated the Geneva Convention against torture and other methods could be used to obtain the same information. The use of enhanced interrogation techniques also had harmed America's image, McCain said. ""If you inflict enough pain on anyone, they'll tell you anything to make the pain stop. So you not only get perhaps right information but you also get a lot of wrong information,"" McCain said. ""The damage that it did to America's image in the world is something we're still on the way to repairing. This is an ideological struggle as well as a physical one.""","""A terrible decision"" former vice president says of reviewing interrogations .

"(CNN) -- Explosions hit two metro stations and a courthouse in Cairo on Wednesday, injuring at least four people, state media reported. Two blasts went off at two different metro stations during the early morning rush hour, Egypt's state-run Al-Ahram website said. The first explosion in the metro was caused by an improvised bomb at Shubra station, Al-Ahram reported, citing Interior Ministry spokesman Abdel-Fattah Othman. The second blast came from a ""sonic explosive"" in a trash can at Ghamra station, it said. The ministry spokesman denied earlier reports that explosions had gone off at more than two stations. Metro stations were reported to have been brought to a complete standstill as the ministry has declared a maximum alert. Another blast struck near the Heliopolis courthouse in eastern Cairo, Al-Ahram reported, citing eyewitnesses and local media. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts. Militants in Egypt have stepped up attacks since the military's ouster last year of former President Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected top leader. Last month, a spate of deadly explosions struck around the country, including one near a Cairo metro station.","NEW: A blast goes off near a courthouse in eastern Cairo, state media report .

"(CNN) -- My son has recently been released from active reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza, and the two sides are again talking about a serious ceasefire. I am relieved to have my son back and to see that we are talking instead of shooting, and pray that this latest round of negotiations succeeds in bringing us stability and progress towards peace. The recent violence has left many dead and wounded, homeless and traumatized on both sides, as well as terrible destruction. Worst of all, it has overwhelmed many of us with a sense of hopelessness regarding the prospects for peace here. Both the Hamas leadership and the Israeli government have chosen conflict over real peace negotiations again and again in the past. They are apparently only able to haggle over ceasefire deals between rounds of fighting. The lead-up to the outbreak of hostilities included the wave of mutual hatred and fear that swept the Jewish and Palestinian populations in the wake of the kidnapping and murder of three young Israeli teenagers in the Etzion Bloc and the revenge murder of a Palestinian youth in Shuafat, followed by Israeli mass arrests of Hamas operatives in the West Bank, and the arrest of three Jewish extremists in the Jerusalem region. Israel had also signaled its disapproval of the recently established Fatah-Hamas unity government by exacerbating its blockade of Gaza, punishing 1.8 million Gazans. Hamas responded by unilaterally opening fire and shooting hundreds of missiles at Israeli population centers. The rest is well known -- Operation Protective Edge with the destruction and death you have seen on TV screen and other media. If not for the Iron Dome anti-missile batteries (an Israeli invention with U.S. investment) protecting those cities, the destruction and deaths on the Israeli side would have been much greater. We Israelis on the whole supported this action, though there were some protests from the radical left and Arab citizens. The internal arguments regarding (frozen) negotiations with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and the future of the settlements were set aside as the country was mobilized to support the armed forces in what was seen as an act of defense against the rocket fire. A week later, with the onset of the ground offensive, the destruction of the many tunnels dug into our territory for purposes of kidnapping and terrorist killings became the focus of popular support for the IDF. My son, an infantry soldier in reserves, was called up to protect his people, as I have had to do in the past, and as my father did in Poland when fighting the Germans as a partisan. On the other hand, few Israelis questioned the means by which we deal with these threats or whether the path to this bloodshed was indeed unavoidable. Fewer Israelis wanted to hear criticism of the rising numbers of uninvolved Palestinian dead and wounded from the IDF's actions. Those of us in the human rights community who asked questions about this, however carefully and hesitantly, were vilified as unpatriotic or even as traitors, and some activists were physically attacked. Faced with these reactions, I fear for Israeli democracy and the moral fiber of the country. When faced with a struggle with a hate-fueled terrorist organization like Hamas, which has no compunction in breaking even humanitarian ceasefire agreements (they broke five or six), and which uses its own civilian population for cover, it is understandable that Israeli nerves might be frayed. The strength of my country and my people through history has always been its ability to debate, be self-critical, and respect differences of opinion. There is certainly no prospect for peace here in Israel if the extremists within the present government have their way. If the Palestinians, on the other hand, are able to change direction and reject the ways of Hamas as uncompromising haters of Israel's very existence, they would strengthen the hand of the many Israelis who continue to dream and strive for peace. Some of us see that as a religious commandment -- as Hillel the elder said (Sayings of the Fathers, chapt. 1, Mishna 12, Talmud), one should pursue peace as did Aharon the high priest: ""Strive for peace and pursue it"". (Psalms, 34,15) After shaky start, cease-fire extension appears to hold . Is Mideast peace as far away as ever?","Yehiel Grenimann is based in Jerusalem and works with Rabbis for Human Rights .

"(CNN) -- An undersea cable carrying Internet traffic was cut off the Persian Gulf emirate of Dubai, officials said Friday, the third loss of a line carrying Internet and telephone traffic in three days. Dubai has been hit hard by an Internet outage apparently caused by a cut undersea cable. Ships have been dispatched to repair two undersea cables damaged on Wednesday off Egypt. FLAG Telecom, which owns one of the cables, said repairs were expected to be completed by February 12. France Telecom, part owner of the other cable, said it was uncertain when repairs on it would be repaired. Stephan Beckert, an analyst with TeleGeography, a research company that consults on global Internet issues, said the cables off Egypt were likely damaged by ships' anchors. The loss of the two Mediterranean cables -- FLAG Telecom's FLAG Europe-Asia cable and SeaMeWe-4, a cable owned by a consortium of more than a dozen telecommunications companies -- has snarled Internet and phone traffic from Egypt to India. Officials said Friday it was unclear what caused the damage to FLAG's FALCON cable about 50 kilometers off Dubai. A repair ship was en route, FLAG said. Eric Schoonover, a senior analyst with TeleGeography, said the FALCON cable is designed on a ""ring system,"" taking it on a circuit around the Persian Gulf and enabling traffic to be more easily routed around damage. Schoonover said the two cables damaged Wednesday collectively account for as much as three-quarters of the international communications between Europe and the Middle East, so their loss had a much bigger effect. Without the use of the FLAG Europe-Asia cable and SeaMeWe-4, some carriers were forced to reroute their European traffic around the globe, which could cause delays, Beckert said. Other carriers could use SeaMeWe-3, an older cable that remained the only direct connection from Europe to the Middle East and Asia. Because this cable is older, it has a smaller capacity than the two damaged cables, Beckert said. Still, Beckert stressed that although the problem created a ""big pain"" for many of carriers, it did not compare to the several months of disruption in East Asia in 2006 after an earthquake damaged seven undersea cables near Taiwan. TeleGeography Research Director Alan Mauldin said new cables planned to link Europe with Egypt should provide enough backup to prevent most similar problems in the future. Schoonover said a similar Internet problem could not happen in the United States. ""We have all the content here,"" he said. ""It's not going to be felt other than we won't get the BBC."" TeleGeography officials also said most traffic between the U.S., Canada and Mexico is carried over land, and there is a plentiful supply of undersea cables carrying traffic under the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Meanwhile, Internet service was slow Friday in Dubai and Egypt, where online service was intermittent, but there was less demand because many businesses in those countries aren't open on Fridays. Service providers in Egypt said they hoped to have improved capacity by Sunday. Web surfers in India were experiencing a marked improvement in service, though graphic- or video-heavy sites were still taking longer to load. Most of the major Internet service providers in India, like Reliance and VSNL, were starting to use backup lines Friday, allowing service to slowly come back, said Rajesh Chharia, president of the Internet Services Providers Association of India. The Indian ISPs were still alerting customers to slowdowns over the next few days with service quality delays of 50 percent to 60 percent, he said. The Internet slowdowns had no effect on trading at the country's two main stock exchanges, the SENSEX and the NSE, because they aren't dependent on the downed cables, Chharia said. Individual Web users were still feeling the effects. Madhu Vohra, who lives in the city of Noida on the outskirts of Delhi, said she uses Internet phone service Skype to call her son in the United States, but she hasn't been able to reach him since the slowdown. ""We keep trying for a long time and the message comes up, 'This page can't display,' so finally we just turn the computer off and give up,"" Vohra said. Internet cafes typically full of teenaged gamers are nearly empty with speeds still frustratingly slow. ""I felt like beating the ... modem, throwing it away, because we compete on the Internet and it feels really bad,"" said Aman Khurana, 13. State-owned Dubai telecom provider Du and Kuwait's Ministry of Communications estimated Thursday that the problems might take two weeks to fix. E-mail to a friend .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- All charges against George Obama, half-brother to U.S. President Barack Obama, have been dropped after his arrest in a drug raid, according to police in Kenya. George Obama was arrested in Kenya on suspicion of marijuana possession, according to police. He was released on Saturday hours later, police added. Obama was arrested in a Nairobi slum, and he was picked up with people who possessed marijuana, said police spokesman Eric Kiraithe. ""Being found with people who are in possession of cannabis is a petty offense,"" Kiraithe said. Earlier, police had told CNN that Obama had been arrested for possessing cannabis and resisting arrest, which can carry a sentence of up to a year in jail or hefty fines. ""Police in Kenya do not look at criminals in light of associations with relatives,"" Kiraithe said. Obama and the president barely know each other, though they have met. George Obama was one of the few people closely related to the president who did not attend the inauguration in Washington. In his memoir, ""Dreams from My Father,"" Barack Obama describes meeting George as a ""painful affair."" His trip to Kenya meant meeting family he had never known. CNN tracked down George Obama in August 2008 and found him at a small house in Huruma, a Nairobi slum, where he lives with his mother's extended family. His birth certificate shows he is Barack Obama's half brother. The two men share the same Kenyan father. In the memoir, Barack Obama struggles to reconcile with his father after he left him and his mother when he was a child. Barack Obama Sr. died in a car accident when George was 6 months old. And like his half brother, George hardly knew his father. George was his father's last child and had not been aware of his famous half brother until he rose to prominence in the Democratic primaries last year. Unlike his grandmother in Kogela, in western Kenya, George Obama received little attention from the media until reports about him surfaced in August 2008. The reports sprung from an Italian Vanity Fair article saying George Obama lived in a shack and was ""earning less than a dollar a day."" The reports left George Obama angry. ""I was brought up well. I live well even now,"" he said. ""The magazines, they have exaggerated everything. ""I think I kind of like it here. There are some challenges, but maybe it is just like where you come from, there are the same challenges,"" Obama said. Obama, who is in his mid-20s, said at the time that he was learning to become a mechanic and was active in youth groups in Huruma. He said he tries to help the community as much as he can.","Police: ""Being found with people ... in possession of cannabis is a petty offense""

"(CNN) -- The death of an Indian dentist who died after a miscarriage in an Irish hospital was the result of medical misadventure, an inquest jury ruled Friday. Savita Halappanavar, 31, was 17 weeks pregnant when she died in October at University Hospital Galway. The inquest jury heard seven days of evidence from staff and expert witnesses, as well as her widower, Praveen Halappanavar. A pathologist, Professor Grace Callagy, told the inquest the cause of death was septic shock, E. Coli in Savita Halappanavar's bloodstream and a miscarriage. In his evidence, a leading obstetrician said Halappanavar's life could have been saved had a termination been carried out a day or two before her miscarriage. However, Dr. Peter Boylan admitted it would not have been practical under Irish law, which states there has to be a real and substantial risk to the mother's life. The coroner, Dr. Ciaran MacLoughlin, on Friday directed jurors at Galway Coroner's Court to consider carefully the verdict and his recommendations, including that Ireland's Medical Council should lay out exactly when doctors can intervene to save the life of a mother. The jury unanimously returned the misadventure verdict and ""strongly endorsed"" his recommendations. MacLoughlin told the dentist's husband: ""The whole of Ireland has followed your story and I want, on their behalf, to offer our deepest sympathy."" Outside the court, Praveen Halappanavar said he still had not got all the answers but would ""get to the bottom of the truth."" Somebody has to take responsibility for his wife's death, he said. He told reporters that the way Savita had been treated in the hospital was ""horrendous, barbaric and inhuman."" Friday was particularly poignant as it would have been the couple's fifth wedding anniversary, he added. In his evidence last week, Praveen Halappananvar said that he had been told an abortion could not be done while the fetus was still alive because Ireland is a Catholic country. The couple were married in India before moving to Ireland, where they had lived for four years before Savita's death. 'System failures' Giving evidence last week, consultant Dr. Katherine Astbury, who treated Halappanavar, denied saying an abortion could not be carried out ""because Ireland is a Catholic country."" But she acknowledged that she felt constrained by Irish law, which does not permit a termination even if there is no prospect of the fetus surviving. Astbury also admitted that there were ""system failures"" in Halappanavar's care. For example, Astbury had not been made aware of blood test abnormalities and an infection, she said. A midwife at Galway hospital, Ann Maria Burke, apologized in her evidence for telling Halappanavar a termination would not be possible ""because Ireland is a Catholic country.""

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Large protests outside the Catalan regional Parliament in Barcelona on Wednesday left 36 people slightly injured, including 12 regional police officers, a spokeswoman for the Catalan regional ambulance service SEM told CNN. Of the 24 protesters injured, three were sent to hospital, said the spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified. The demonstrators gathered outside the Catalan Parliament to protest the debate inside on the 2011 budget, which many expect to result in further economic austerity measures in Catalonia. A spokeswoman for the Mossos regional police force said there had been injuries to protesters and the police but she could not immediately provide specifics. The Catalan regional president, Artur Mas, arrived at Parliament in a police helicopter along with several regional members of Parliament, the police spokeswoman said. But various elected politicians who entered by car or on foot to the sealed-off parliamentary grounds were jostled or heckled by the protesters, and some were spray painted with the color red, Spanish media reported. Spain is gripped by a deep economic crisis with 21% unemployment nationwide, and 42% unemployment for young people. The Catalan Parliament protests were seen as part of the so-called May 15 movement of demonstrations that have sprung up across Spain since last May 15, including tent cities in some emblematic public squares in various Spanish cities. Various Spanish political leaders criticized the protesters on Wednesday for trying to disrupt the normal parliamentary activities which they said are fundamental to a democracy, Spanish media reported.","Protests leave 36 people injured in Barcelona .

"(CNN) -- Keeping Sumatran tigers, orangutans and elephants in captivity is not an ideal situation. These animals should be in the wild. The problem is, their habitat is dwindling to such a low level, and it's often safer for the animals to live in captivity. The habitat for critically endangered Sumatran tigers has dwindled so much and poaching is such a large threat that there are more Sumatran tigers in captivity than live in the wild. As the number of tigers decrease, the captive tigers are the species' only hope for survival. There are those animals living in captivity that can't be released back into the wild. These are animals with diseases or defects like tigers that were rescued from poacher's snares. Many of these tigers are missing paws and parts of their legs. In the wild, they would have difficulty finding food and escaping danger. In this case, the tigers are put in zoos or sanctuaries like Taman Safari Indonesia featured in Expedition: Sumatra. Read more: The battle to save Sumatra's elephants . Animals in sanctuaries like this can serve an important purpose. They are ambassadors of their kind, educators of sorts for people to learn about them. The more people know about these animals and hear about the problems these animals face in the wild, the less likely they will want to kill them or destroy their habitat. The animals also inspire fundraising for the important work conservationist groups are doing to preserve these species. Captive animals also have another important role. In the wild, as populations decline, animals start to mate with their close relatives creating problems associated with inbreeding. When sanctuaries and zoos breed these animals, they make sure to do it with the genetic diversity of the species in mind. It is all a proactive approach that could prevent the extinction of the species. Read more: The final days of the Sumatran tiger? It's the sad truth that humans are causing and trying to the problem of animal population loss. Some of us are turning the rainforest into giant palm oil plantations and some of us are working to save that rainforest. Some of us are killing the tigers to sell their skins and some of us are taking care of disabled baby tigers in captivity to make sure the species doesn't go extinct. We humans are at war with ourselves and it's a war the endangered Sumatran wildlife is slowing losing. Without some kind of action to stop poaching and habitat loss, the critically endangered Sumatran elephants, orangutans and tigers will slowly and quietly decline. These once majestic species will only be seen behind a barrier at a zoo. Eventually, the species will go extinct. That's what conservationists at sanctuaries and zoos as well as non-profit groups like WWF are pushing so hard to stop. Education through the animal ambassadors in captivity is one way to help reverse the trend and hopefully save the species from irradiation.","There are more Sumatran tigers in captivity than live in the wild .

"(CNN) -- It's happened to all of us. You wake up, have a bite, sip your coffee and then, full of energy and renewed optimism, you set off convinced that today will finally be your most productive day ever. And then commuting happens. Delayed trains, crammed buses, gridlock traffic -- they're all there to drain out your energy and hold you back from that promotion you feel you righteously deserve. But what if you could avoid crowded streets and ill-tempered drivers once and for all by simply taking to the skies in less than 60 seconds? That's the proposal put forward by Eduardo Galvani, a Brazilian visual artist and creator of the Fly Citycopter, an urban aerial vehicle concept designed to help commuters whizz around easier and in a more green way. Galvani's futuristic vision calls for a superlight personal helicopter that would be able to take off, fly and land while in autopilot mode. Made from carbon, aluminum and titanium, the Citycopter would use a combination of fans and electricity-powered motors to fly two people at a maximum speed of 130 miles per hour. In addition, solar cells embedded on the aircraft's exterior would allow it to generate energy during the flight and help it reduce urban pollution. ""For most humans, a personal aerial vehicle is still just like a distant dream,"" says Galvani, 36. ""But when you think about this, and mentally join some pieces, you can realize that the actual available materials and technologies can make possible for us to create this new reality, where a personal helicopter can be most efficient, economic, safer and easy to pilot than a common helicopter, and a smart way of transportation."" True, there are still many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can fly our commuting blues away. Yet, Galvani says, he hopes his concept would inspire creative people to come together and develop cleaner -- and more exciting -- ways of urban transportation.

"(CNN) -- At least nine people were killed Thursday night in an explosion in the Nigerian capital city of Abuja, Nigerian authorities said. Manzo Ezekiel, a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency, told CNN that some kind of device exploded just after 8 p.m. While security agencies cordoned off the area, response agencies said they moved injured victims to hospitals and bodies to the mortuary. Eleven unconscious victims received medical attention in different hospitals. The bus station was loaded with laborers on their way back home for the May Day holiday. Nigerian radio called for people to donate blood for those with injuries. Ezekiel said the blast happened about 100 meters from the scene of an April 14 explosion that killed 71 people. In that blast, about 130 people were hurt when a parked vehicle exploded in the Nyanya Motor Park bus station crowded with early morning commuters. Boko Haram's leader claimed responsibility for the April 14 bombing. The Islamist militant group -- whose name means ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language -- has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Tom Brokaw has had enough of ""bridgegate."" Appearing last week on MSNBC's ""Daily Rundown,"" the veteran newsman lamented the fact that so many of his colleagues are stuck on the story of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's bridge problems. They can't stop talking about whether members of Christie's staff tried to harass the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, New Jersey, by shutting down traffic lanes on the George Washington Bridge, and whether Christie was in on it. Do you ever get the sense that the media are on Mars while most Americans are on Earth? This story confirms it. We've known that those who spoon-feed us the news march to their own drum, but now it's clear they have their own agenda. It's not to pass along the information that helps shape people's concerns, but rather to tell people what they should be concerned about. Like a traffic jam. Brokaw put it this way: ""I do think, across the country, however, when they're looking at long-term unemployment, and they're looking at the uncertainty of the Obamacare, they're saying, 'You've got to move on, guys.'"" I'm all for moving on. The media can start up again if it discovers evidence Christie knew about the lane closures and then lied about it. But I'm also fond of self-awareness, especially from those of us in the media. So my message to Brokaw is: ""Newsman, heal thy own network."" In the last couple of weeks, it has begun to look like NBC stands for ""Nothing But Christie."" According to the conservative media watchdog site, Newsbusters, since the bridge story broke on January 8, NBC News has aired more than 25 full reports in less than 10 days. The angry liberal talk show hosts on MSNBC are even worse, droning on about the bridge story day after day in what is a blatant attempt to smear Christie. What do you suppose is more annoying? Being stuck in traffic for hours on a bridge -- or watching the media get stuck for days on a story about a juvenile stunt that might, or might not, bloom into a full-blown scandal? I'd have to go with the latter, especially when you consider that the media seem addicted to the story in hopes that it could somehow derail the plans of a Republican presidential hopeful. It's a long walk from one to the other, but see if you can follow me there. If Christie was in the loop, then he lied at his marathon press conference. If there is one thing that our friends in the Fourth Estate will not tolerate it's a liar. That is, at least not a Republican liar. That's part of the problem with this, the sense that a story about partisanship run amok is itself partisan in the way it's being covered. Left-leaning elements of the media are trying to blow it up into a scandal to help clear the way for the likely Democratic presidential nominee -- Hillary Clinton. The other problem is that too many Americans have quickly jumped to the wrong conclusion. No, not about whether Christie knew about the prank and conspired to inconvenience scores of New Jersey residents in order to bully a political opponent. I'm talking about the other conclusion -- the one about how being a bully is a negative trait in an elected official, and perhaps even enough to end a political career. Is that so? Who made that determination? Think back to the great leaders who helped define the last century -- from Teddy Roosevelt to Winston Churchill to Franklin D. Roosevelt to Harry Truman to Margaret Thatcher to Ronald Reagan. You had better believe that those people had moments when they acted like bullies. That's part of politics. Besides, it seems like just yesterday that presidential candidates like George H.W. Bush and Michael Dukakis were trying to stiffen their upper lips and overcome the so-called ""wimp factor."" We Americans are a fickle bunch. America could use more strength on the world stage. We needn't push around other countries, but -- whether we're talking about China or Libya or North Korea -- we also need a president who won't let our country be pushed around either. Who's afraid of big, bad bullies? Voters aren't. They keep voting them into office -- perhaps in the hopes that they'll use their strength for good. I'm still not sure that Christie knows how to do that. Yet, if he aspires to greatness, and to be the kind of leader that helps define this century, he had better learn fast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Tom Brokaw's right -- Media should move on from Christie story .

"(CNN) -- Six people who attempted to climb Mount Rainier in Washington state have been involved in some sort of fall, with ""no viable chance of survival,"" a park official said after a helicopter search team spotted climbing gear on the mountain Saturday. Tents and equipment believed to belong to the group were located in the area of Carbon Glacier, a debris area with a lot of falling rocks and ice, said Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Fawn Bauer. Rescuers received a signal from the party's emergency beacons, but will continue their search by air only, because entering the area from the ground is too dangerous for a rescue crew, Bauer said. The climbing party, which included two experienced guides, last made contact with the park Wednesday afternoon. At that time, Bauer said, the party indicated everything was fine and that they were at 12,800 feet. The climbers planned to reach the summit on Thursday and descend on Friday. Friday afternoon, Alpine Ascent, the company affiliated with the guides, notified the park that they were not able to locate the group. About 10,000 people attempt to scale Mount Rainier each year, but only about half reach the 14,417-foot summit, according to the National Park Service.","Six people are missing after trying to climb Mount Rainier .

"(CNN) -- Jon Meis' reported habit of carrying pepper spray may have saved students' lives after a man opened fire at a Seattle college. The shooter had just wounded three people Thursday, one of whom died. He was reloading his shotgun when Meis, a volunteer security guard, saw an opening. He doused the gunman with the spray and tackled him to the ground. Other students at Seattle Pacific University piled on and took the weapon away from suspected shooter Aaron Ybarra, 26, police said. Officers are convinced the bloodshed at the Christian school would have been worse had Meis and the others not intervened. A man who said he was close friends with Meis' older brother and sister-and-law described him as ""amazingly resourceful."" ""I wasn't surprised to see he was the hero -- his resourcefulness, love for others and knowledge of the greater good are what defines him, in my mind,"" Andrew Van Ness told CNN in an e-mail. Van Ness said Meis enjoyed playing a campus ""humans versus zombies"" game organized by the school's Student Union Board, finishing in the top 10 both times the game was held. On Thursday, Meis appeared shaken, at moments on the verge of tears, when ambulances arrived to tend to the wounded. Medics put him on a stretcher and took him to a hospital to check him over. Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg didn't identify Meis by name but said a man believed to be the student hero was thoroughly evaluated and released. He had no injuries, she said. Police would not give out his name, but one of his friends was quick to point him out to CNN affiliate KOMO and pour out his gratitude. ""I could have been one of these people that was injured or in critical condition,"" said Meis' friend Patrick Maguire. ""A lot of (students) were in that building, and he stopped him in the lobby. He didn't get any farther than that. I'm grateful for him, yeah."" Meis, an engineering student, has a reputation for keeping a low profile, not seeking attention, The Seattle Times reported. He is known as a devout Christian and an excellent student. Meis' sister told the newspaper that the family wasn't commenting for the moment. But he hasn't been able to dodge the social media limelight, which has plastered his name and photos across the Internet with emphatic kudos. ""Hero"" was the common refrain. ""Jon Meis is a hero. I have no words for his courage,"" user Molli Elizabeth posted to Twitter. ""Jon Meis, You are my hero! Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.

"ZHOUSHAN, China (CNN)  -- They operate from a bare apartment on a Chinese island. They are intelligent 20-somethings who seem harmless. But they are hard-core hackers who claim to have gained access to the world's most sensitive sites, including the Pentagon. The leader of these Chinese hackers says there ""is always a weakness"" on networks that allows cyber break-ins. In fact, they say they are sometimes paid secretly by the Chinese government -- a claim the Beijing government denies. ""No Web site is one hundred percent safe. There are Web sites with high-level security, but there is always a weakness,"" says Xiao Chen, the leader of this group. ""Xiao Chen"" is his online name. Along with his two colleagues, he does not want to reveal his true identity. The three belong to what some Western experts say is a civilian cyber militia in China, launching attacks on government and private Web sites around the world.  Watch hackers' clandestine Chinese operation » . If there is a profile of a cyber hacker, these three are straight from central casting -- young and thin, with skin pale from spending too many long nights in front of a computer. One hacker says he is a former computer operator in the People's Liberation Army; another is a marketing graduate; and Xiao Chen says he is a self-taught programmer. ""First, you must know about the Web site you want to attack. You must know what program it is written with,"" says Xiao Chen. ""There is a saying, 'Know about both yourself and the enemy, and you will be invincible.'"" CNN decided to withhold the address of these hackers' Web site, but Xiao Chen says it has been operating for more than three years, with 10,000 registered users. The site offers tools, articles, news and flash tutorials about hacking. Private computer experts in the United States from iDefense Security Intelligence, which provides cybersecurity advice to governments and Fortune 500 companies, say the group's site ""appears to be an important site in the broader Chinese hacking community."" Arranging a meeting with the hackers took weeks of on-again, off-again e-mail exchanges. When they finally agreed, CNN was told to meet them on the island of Zhoushan, just south of Shanghai and a major port for China's navy. The apartment has cement floors and almost no furniture. What they do have are three of the latest computers. They are cautious when it comes to naming the Web sites they have hacked. On camera, Xiao Chen denies knowing anyone who has targetted U.S. government Web sites. But off-camera, in conversations over three days, he claims two of his colleagues -- not the ones with him in the room -- hacked into the Pentagon and downloaded information, although he wouldn't specify what was gleaned. CNN has no way to confirm if his claim is true. ""They would not publicize this,"" he says of someone who hacks the U.S. Defense Department. ""It is very sensitive."" This week, the Pentagon said computer networks in the United States, Germany, Britain and France were hit last year by what they call ""multiple intrusions,"" many of them originating from China. At a congressional hearing in Washington last week, administration officials testified that the government's cyber initiative has fallen far short of what is required. Most alarming, the officials said, there has never been a full damage assessment of federal agency networks.  Watch Pentagon bans Google from bases » . ""We are here today because we must do more,"" said Robert Jamison, a top official in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. ""Defending the federal system in its current configuration is a significant challenge."" U.S. officials have been cautious not to directly accuse the Chinese military or its government of hacking into its network. But David Sedney, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, says, ""The way these intrusions are conducted are certainly consistent with what you would need if you were going to actually carry out cyber warfare."" Beijing hit back at that, denying such an allegation and calling on the United States to provide proof. ""If they have any evidence, I hope they would provide it. Then, we can cooperate on this issue,"" Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said during a regular press briefing this week. But again off-camera, Xiao Chen says after the alleged Pentagon attack, his colleagues were paid by the Chinese government. CNN has no way to independently confirm if that is true. His allegations brought strenuous denials from Beijing. ""I am telling you honestly, the Chinese government does not do such a thing,"" Qin said. But if Xiao Chen is telling the truth, it appears his colleagues launched a freelance attack -- not initiated by Beijing, but paid for after the fact. ""These hacker groups in my opinion are not agents of the Chinese state,"" says James Mulvenon from the Center for Intelligence Research and Analysis, which works with the U.S. intelligence community. ""They are sort of useful idiots for the Beijing regime."" He adds, ""These young hackers are tolerated by the regime provided that they do not conduct attacks inside of China."" One of the biggest problems experts say is trying to prove where a cyber attack originates from, and that they say allows hackers like Xiao Chen to operate in a virtual world of deniability. And across China, there could be thousands just like him, all trying to prove themselves against some of the most secure Web sites in the world.

Would you click on that headline? When you give your iReport a bland label instead of a vibrant, compelling headline, you might as well slap ""Don't read this"" on the top of your story. You have to give readers a reason to spend their time on your submission. A good headline on the mainpage at CNN.com can be the difference between 200 clicks and 200,000 or more. So what works and what doesn't? Here are some tips for writing that perfect, click-worthy headline: . Paint a picture . No: Texas playground scare . Yes: Playground erupts in flames . A playground scare could be a flasher in a trench coat. It could be a splintery teeter-totter. But a playground erupting in flames? That's a click magnet. Be specific . No: Dog nurses kitten . Yes: Rottweiler nurses kitten . Before you know the breed, you might be interested. But you might not. Once you know it's a Rottweiler with a little kitty, you just have to see it. Putting interesting details in headlines is a good way of enticing the reader. Click. But not too specific . No: Food shortages in Zimbabwe . Yes: Stores' shelves stripped bare .

No: Curb appeal lost on neighbors . Yes: 26-toilet mansion planned . What makes your iReport a must-watch? What detail of the story kept you talking? Tease and tantalize the reader with those catchy specifics. If you can throw in a number, all the better, because that gives an idea of the magnitude of the situation. And people like numbers in general. Use common words . No: Unclothed . Yes: Naked . No: Suds . Yes: Beer . Using slang will limit your audience. A reader won't spend time decoding your cleverness. If they don't get the headline right away, you will lose their attention. Verbs good; labels bad . No: Mortgage meltdown . Yes: 300,000 lose homes to banks . The first words of your headline should be compelling to draw interest, but then the verb is a call for readers to take action and watch. Don't skimp on nice, juicy words and vivid images.

"New York (CNN) -- In the end, it might not be the DNA evidence collected high atop the Brooklyn Bridge or license-plate checks on the thousands of cars that crossed the iconic span overnight that solve the giant flag caper. In the words of a pair of German artists -- Matthias Wermke and Mischa Leinkauf -- the replacement of the Stars and Stripes fluttering above the bridge with two massive white flags last month was nothing more than an ""art project"" by the two performance artists meant to deal with ""questions of historical legacy and art in the public sphere."" In fact, the NYPD only learned of the artists' possible involvement after their story appeared on the New York Times website Tuesday afternoon. Specifically, a law enforcement official said, the video the artists provided to the Times appeared to show the white flags from a position that would lend legitimacy to their claim. The claims are being taken seriously, two law enforcement officials told CNN. It's unclear if the Manhattan district attorney will be able to or even attempt to extradite the men, who told the Times they would cooperate in the investigation. In a statement, the artists called the project ""White American Flags."" ""They were careful to treat the bridge and the flags with respect and followed the U.S. Flag Code,"" the statement said. ""The return of the original flags is in progress. Like an empty canvas, White American Flags invites many readings, multiple interpretations and projections."" At the time of the stunt, many New Yorkers wondered whether it represented an act of terrorism or an anti-American statement. The American flags atop the bridge towers were replaced in the overnight hours of July 21 to July 22, and the white banner s were spotted early in the morning. ""White American Flags"" was meant in part as a tribute the German-born American architect of the Brooklyn Bridge, John August Roebling, who left Germany in 1831 ""in search of a better future in the land of freedom and opportunity,"" the artists' statement said. As part of the investigation after the switch, intelligence analysts looked into any possible significance of the day that was chosen to see whether that may yield clues. It turned out to the 145th anniversary of the death of John August Roebling. The claim of credit by the artists appears to have taken the NYPD by surprise. NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence John Miller said at a news conference last month that the NYPD had video showing four or five people crossing the bridge just after 3 a.m. Within the hour, the light that normally illuminates the flag on the Brooklyn side of the bridge flickered and appeared to go out. A few minutes later the same thing occurred on the tower on the Manhattan side. ""At this time, it appears it has no particular nexus to terrorism or even politics,"" Miller said Tuesday. ""This may be somebody's art project, or it may be an attempt at making some kind of statement, but at this point it's not clear what the statement is."" Look's like art project was it. ""The city has always been a magnet for artists, a metropolis praised as 'the global center of creativity,' where new progressive art has its place,"" the artists said in their statement.

"(CNN) -- A young male pulled a handgun Friday afternoon inside a Philadelphia high school gymnasium, firing and hitting two fellow students, police said. The injured boy and girl, each 15, were transported in stable condition after being shot in the arm just before 3:30 p.m., Philadelphia police Lt. John Stanford said. The students were among about seven in the Delaware Valley Charter High School gym at that time -- some playing basketball, others in one corner -- according to city police Commissioner Charles Ramsey. ""The suspect is part of that group,"" Ramsey said. Both victims appeared to have been struck once inside the gym of Delaware Valley Charter High School, said Stanford. Ramsey said that authorities didn't know yet if they were struck by the same bullet or more than one, noting that no shell was found at the scene. He described their wounds as non-life threatening. The school went into lockdown as law enforcement officers cleared it and hunted for the suspect, who had left the building, according to Stanford. The police lieutenant said students were searched and then let out of the school. He also said surveillance video had captured the incident. A short time later, Philadelphia police tweeted they had a suspect in custody. Officer Jillian Russell, a police spokeswoman, said he was 17 years old. Ramsey later said authorities were able to ""identify him right away,"" after which officers were sent to his home. ""We were able to grab him,"" the police commissioner said. ""We did not recover the gun, but we do have him in custody and he has been positively identified."" But a few hours later, Stanford said that young man was not the shooter as police initially thought, though he was at the scene. He was ""completely cleared by investigators and released"" later that night, the police lieutenant said. By then, Philadelphia police had announced they were ""still looking for additional suspects."" This includes searching for a weapon possibly used in the shooting in trash cans, along the tracks and other spots around the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's Olney station, SEPTA spokesman Andrew Busch said. While a gun hadn't been found by 9 p.m., Stanford said one of the two young males authorities had been looking for had turned himself in. A third male wanted by police had been expected to do the same but had not turned himself in as of 10:45 p.m., added the police spokesman. All three youths are Delaware Valley Charter High School students. It is not clear if any of them are, in fact, the shooter. No one had been charged as of Friday night. Asked about what might have prompted the shooting, Ramsey said, ""We don't know the motives -- don't know if it was an accident, don't know if it was intentional."" Located in the Olney section of Philadelphia, Delaware Valley Charter High School is open to any student who lives in the city. In its 2011 annual report to the state Department of Education, the school noted that it moved into its new facility in June 2006 and reported significant growth in reading and math test scores in recent years. Friday's incident was at least the second shooting at or near a school this week. In New Mexico on Tuesday, a 12-year-old student with a sawed off, 20-gauge pump shotgun opened fire in a crowded gymnasium at Berrendo Middle School, according to authorities. Two students were seriously injured and the shooter was in custody. Ramsey, the Philadelphia police commissioner, acknowledged that such shootings are ""happening across our country all too often, and it's just got to stop."" ""(When) people send their kids to school, they shouldn't have to pick them up at the hospital,"" Ramsey added. ""I mean, these kind of things just absolutely should not happen."" CNN's Jason Carroll, Poppy Harlow, Cristy Lenz, Haley Draznin, Kevin Conlon and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.","NEW: Police: Student initially identified as the shooter is ""cleared and released""

"Washington (CNN) -- Watchdogs and even some members of Congress raised alarms Tuesday after learning that the House of Representatives quietly changed how lawmakers report privately funded travel worth millions of dollars a year, removing those trips from one of the most high-profile reports that members must file. But as the change sent out ripples of outrage, it was not clear how wide-ranging the effect would be, because the trip information remains easily accessible in a separate report. Immediate concern . Two Democrats immediately expressed concern. ""Both the change to our financial disclosure forms and the fact it was done so quietly are extremely troubling for those of us who believe in transparency and accountability"" wrote Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Illinois, who co-chairs the House Transparency Caucus. The rule change was made in a committee vote. Quigley's office said he has requested that the committee reverse it's decision. The top Democrat in the House agrees. ""The new rule presented by the Ethics Committee for disclosure of travel must be reversed,"" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California wrote in a statement. ""While the committee's aim was to simplify the disclosure process, Congress must always move in the direction of more disclosure, not less."" A tale of two reports . Pelosi is referring to the idea that the Ethics Committee may have removed the reporting requirement from the Financial Disclosure Report because the trips also must be disclosed, in a more extensive form in the separate Gift and Travel Report. In the Financial Disclosure Report, House members must give online summaries of each private trip in the past six months. But in the Gift and Travel Reports, members must report the trips in detail. Tom Rust, staff director and chief counsel for the Ethics Committee, issued a statement saying the panel ""continues to enforce the requirement that all House Members and staff who wish to accept privately sponsored travel must continue to receive prior approval from the Ethics Committee and to file detailed paperwork about any such trip within 15 days. Neither of those requirements has been changed or diluted in any way."" Rust noted that a database at clerk.house.gov makes publicly available all ""detailed post-travel reports ... on the same page where the public can look up Members' financial disclosure reports."" ""As the House developed the new online financial disclosure system, the Committee's nonpartisan staff recommended a number of changes to the financial disclosure forms, including eliminating the need to report less information about private travel than the traveler had already publicly disclosed the year before,"" the statement continued. ""The Committee adopted these changes and publicly highlighted them on page 2 of the financial disclosure instructions, which were provided to all financial disclosure filers and posted on the Committee's public web site months ago. The Committee is committed to effective and efficient public disclosure, and will continue to look for opportunities to improve the public filings required of Members and staff."" Rust said the statement was authorized by Ethics Committee Chairman Mike Conaway, R-Texas, and ranking Democrat Linda Sanchez, D-California. CNN reached out to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, for reaction, but as of Tuesday afternoon his office had not released any statement. Watchdogs angry . In the meantime, groups that spend countless hours combing over data about Congress immediately decried the change in reporting and sharply questioned whether eliminating a duplicative report was the real motivation behind the change. ""Duplication is not usually a major concern in Congress,"" said Melanie Sloan, the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""The only place they're concerned about duplication is when it's exposing their private travel."" Sloan pointed out that the decision was made behind closed doors and called the Ethics Committee ""tone-deaf,"" charging that it serves more to cover up for unethical conduct than to expose it. Why make this change in disclosure reports? She is blunt in her belief. ""I think they want to take more trips that they don't want people to know about."" Word of the Ethics Committee action came days after reports that longtime Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-New York -- who narrowly won his party's renomination last week -- had failed to report an all-expenses-paid trip he took to China last year. CNN's Paul Courson and Political Editor Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","NEW: Ethics Committee responds, it is ""committed to effective and efficient public disclosure""

"(CNN) -- Reeling from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) has effectively been nationalized after Tokyo approved a request for a 1 trillion yen ($12.5 billion) injection of capital. TEPCO supplies power to nearly 30 million people in the Tokyo region and was once valued at more than $150 billion. But the nuclear disaster that followed Japan's historic earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 has left it dependent on government support. The plan, approved by Trade and Industry Minister Yukio Edano Wednesday, would give the government control of more than 50% of the company, and could increase its hold to two-thirds of the company stock. ""Without the state funds, (TEPCO) cannot provide a stable supply of electricity,"" Edano told reporters at a news conference. However, Edano hoped the government would relinquish control within two years if the restructuring plan successfully returns the company to profitability. ""It will depend on how well TEPCO carries out restructuring measures,"" Edano told reporters. In the 10-year plan, TEPCO has vowed to cut 3.3 trillion yen in costs and turn a profit by March 2014. The company has planned a 10% rate increase for electricity, which the government has yet to approve. The company also hopes to bring back some of its nuclear reactors online. As of last weekend, all of Japan's nuclear reactors were offline for the first time in four decades as the Tomari Nuclear Power Plant's reactor 3 in Hokkaido was shut down for maintenance. In the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, reactors have not been allowed back on, making Japan now the first major economy to see the modern era without nuclear power. The national government's ruling party, the Democratic Party of Japan, has been urging local communities to allow reactors to return to operation. The party's deputy policy chief, Yoshito Sengoku, bluntly said without nuclear energy the world's third-largest economy would suffer. ""We must think ahead to the impact on Japan's economy and people's lives, if all nuclear reactors are stopped. Japan could, in some sense, be committing mass suicide,"" said the party's deputy policy chief, Yoshito Sengoku. Japan's biggest business lobby, Keidanren, joined the plea in an April press conference. ""We cannot possibly agree to do the kind of energy saving yet again this year, or every year from now on,"" said Chairman Hiromasa Yonekura, referring to the country's efforts to turn off air conditioners and shift operation of production lines to weekends. ""The government must bring the nuclear power stations back into operation."" The tsunami that followed last year's magnitude-9 quake swamped the Fukushima Daiichi plant, knocking out power to cooling systems and leading to meltdowns in its three operating reactors. The resulting release of radioactivity forced residents of several towns near the plant to flee their homes, and a 20-kilometer (12.5-mile) zone around the plant remains closed to the public. CNN's Kyung Lah, Anne Renzenbrink and the CNN Wire staff contributed to this report .","The trade and Industry Minister Yukio Edano approved a request for a 1 trillion yen injection .

"(CNN) -- It was one of those mom moments, one of those ""no matter how much you try to plan and do for your children, you can't think of everything"" realizations. (If you have kids, you know exactly what I mean.) I received the advisory about Turner Broadcasting's ""Take Your Kid to Work Day"" plan, part of the national ""Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day"" scheduled for Thursday. (Turner Broadcasting is CNN's parent company.) Here in New York, children ages 8 to 13 will try their hand at being a television anchor by reading from a teleprompter; interview CNN anchors and reporters and get a tour of CNN's studios and newsrooms. It would be a dream-come-true kind of day for my oldest daughter, who just turned 8, and already seems way too comfortable with a microphone in her hand. (""What about being a doctor?"" my journalist husband and I joke when we suspect our gal might follow in our footsteps.) But then came the realization that I had committed to another event the same day. I'll be moderating a panel of amazing women, which is a wonderful thing to do -- but it means I won't be able to take my daughters to work, something I've tried to do nearly every year. I love the whole concept behind the day, giving our children a chance to see what we do when we're not with them while learning about careers that can help influence their professional paths. While my scheduling snafu will likely put me in the doghouse at home for a short time, it does eliminate a challenge I encountered each year, the same one faced by more than 37 million Americans who are participating in the 21st annual day of parents taking their children to work: How to make the day fun and interesting for children, yet realistic? Having our kids think every day is a party doesn't communicate the career aspect of the event -- and no workplace needs children wreaking havoc on the business day. A meltdown in a grocery store is downright cringe-worthy. The same such outburst outside your cubicle? Exponentially more uncomfortable. You can imagine the eye rolls now and the conversation around the water cooler, ""What kind of parent lets their kid do that?"" So, in honor of my fellow parents, I put together five tips, almost a survival guide, to help parents, their sons and daughters get the most out of this special day. 1. Make it memorable . This doesn't mean you have to turn your office environment into a middle school dance party or a visit to Disneyworld, but you do want to make sure your child gets something out of the experience. Having your son or daughter sit next to you in your cubicle while you work on a computer and they play video games is not much different than what they could do at home. ""You don't bring a child there to babysit,"" said George McKecuen, a communications specialist with the Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day Foundation. ""We heard where people bring the children when they're like 5 and 6 months old. I can't think of a horror story much worse than having to do a job and babysit"" an infant, he said. 2. Plan, plan, plan . Many companies will do the planning for you, scheduling a series of events throughout the day to keep the children busy and engaged. ""Whoever is setting up your program has to set it up so the stress is not on the parent to babysit (and) there are things for the young people to do throughout the day,"" McKecuen said. ""It'll make the young people feel better. It'll make the parents feel better too."" If no one is doing the planning for you, do it yourself. Schedule some meaningful events for the day -- introduce your children to your colleagues and have them talk about what they do, have your children attend different meetings with you, show them how you are trying to solve a problem, or have them give you input to help you solve a problem. As with all parenting, planning goes a long way. 3. Don't lose track of them . This sounds obvious, but it's easy to see how it can happen. A parent gets busy with a project or a long conference call, gets distracted and then within minutes their son or daughter is wandering the hallways. Not a problem if you've explained to your children what's expected of them and where they need to be at all times, but somewhat tense if they accidentally walk into a conference room that just happens to be where your boss is holding a big meeting. How do you spell stressful? Parents should explain to children that normal business is operating while they are there. McKecuen suggests telling them: ""We expect you to behave like you would in somebody else's home. This is not a runaway activity."" To keep the anxieties in check, have a plan on what your children can do with you and without you, and where they are expected to be throughout the day. 4. Don't have your kids do your job . If you thought this was your chance to get out of coming up with ideas for the big management meeting, or entering the data for the end of quarter reports, think again! ""This is not a day to put children to work,"" McKecuen said. The goal, of course, is for them to see what you do, and who you work with, and to get a sense of whether your career is one they'd like to pursue down the road. ""The important thing is to make them feel that they're having not just a free day, but they're having a learning experience that will be meaningful, yet not too stressful to them."" 5. Snack time . Putting in a day's work entitles any child some kind of treat when it's all over. As you enjoy a snack together, ask your child what they liked about the day and what they didn't, and what they learned by going to work with you. Their answers will not only help you figure out how to make next year's ""Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day"" even better. They might even help you realize what you love about your job and what you don't. Are you participating in ""Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day""? Chime in in the comments below or tell Kelly Wallace on Twitter and CNN Living on Facebook.","Millions are expected to join in ""Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day""

"(CNN) -- As rockets and missiles fly across the Israeli-Gaza border, CNN's Ben Wedeman describes the mood on the ground in Gaza. Is there a mood for war in Gaza? No. Among people with no affiliation with one faction or another, there is little enthusiasm for this flare-up. People here are exhausted. They see no benefit whatsoever of firing missiles into Israel that result in airstrikes that are extremely disruptive to daily life. Keep in mind that last summer after the overthrow of the Morsy government in Egypt, many of the tunnels under that country's border with Gaza were destroyed, so the economy is in abysmal shape. Most Gazans would like to see an immediate return to peace. They're frustrated that since 2006 when Hamas won elections and took over, Gaza has been under siege. It's very difficult to leave here ... it's very difficult to earn a living, therefore few people are supporting this flare-up. Why is this happening now? Are people supportive of Hamas? Hamas is defiant, saying the blood of the martyrs will be fuel for the Intifada. On Monday night it claimed responsibility for 60 missiles fired into Israel. They're on a war footing. Hamas is blaming Israel for the current flare-up but it's not putting out any olive branches. They're going to contribute firing missiles into Israel until there's some sort of cease-fire. In November 2012 the Egyptians were able to intercede between Israel and Hamas and that led to a ceasefire, but now you have a very different government in Cairo that is hostile to Hamas and seems uninterested in intervening and bringing calm to Gaza. What is the attitude towards Israel? The majority of people in Gaza are the descendants of those who were driven or fled from their homes in 1948-49, some from the very same areas currently being hit by rockets from Gaza. There is a deep sense of loss, of dispossession which is particularly intense in times of conflict. One man told me today ""I hope they bomb the Knesset,"" referring to the militants firing rockets. Another outside a house in Khan Yunis that had just been struck by a missile that left seven dead told me ""the Israelis have been killing us since I can remember. And they will continue to kill us after I die."" Are there dissenting voices critical of Hamas in Gaza? Yes there are. Many people you speak to are opposed to it because all the rocket firing does is make the situation worse. One man I spoke to said: ""Of course we dislike Hamas and want them to go, but if I were to say that in public there would be trouble for me."" Obviously there are few dissenting voices in public; privately there are many. The only real opposition to Hamas is Fatah, but that faction that is dominant only in the West Bank, not in Gaza. Has the crisis reached a tipping point? Why has this flare-up happened now? Is it about more than just the tit-for-tat killings of the Israeli and Palestinian teenagers? In the aftermath of the Israeli teenagers kidnapping on June 12, Israeli officials made it clear they were operating in the West Bank and elsewhere on a two-track approach. On the one hand they wanted to find the boys and catch the kidnappers; on the other they were cracking down on Hamas. That's certainly set the tone. But you have go back to April 1 when Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas announced there would be a unity or reconciliation pact between Fatah and Hamas. The pact had much to do with Israel's decision to stop negotiating with the Palestinians in U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry's Middle East peace initiative. And so the rhetoric coming out of Israel against Hamas and the unity pact has been intensifying since April 1, and redoubling since the June 12 kidnapping of the Israeli teenagers. Is the situation affected by the unrest in Iraq, Syria and Egypt? This is not a recent conflict: it goes back 100 years to the arrival of the first Zionist settlers in Palestine and this is just the latest chapter in a very long book. It's affected of course by the situation elsewhere in the region, but it's very much its own problem. Some Israeli government and military officials in government are worried that the unrest elsewhere could impact the situation in the West Bank in particular. They understand the West Bank is unstable: you've seen clashes in Gaza, clashes in Palestinian-Israeli cities in northern Israel. They are aware that instability outside Israel could be mirrored by instability within Israel and the territories it controls. How are conditions in Gaza compared to previous visits you've made there? It's grim. Most stores are closed, and that may be a function of Ramadan, or it may be a function of the grim state of the economy since the upheaval in Egypt last year. There's a weariness about the constant abnormal situation: keep in mind that the second Palestinian intifada began in September 2000 and Gaza saw the most intense clashes and fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinians. That was followed by the Hamas takeover in June 2007. Then at the end of 2008 into 2009 there was the Israel-Hamas war. Then in November 2012 there was another flare-up between Hamas and Israel. Now there's this. So the economic situation being what it is, people are absolutely exhausted by the constant hammering of problems, crises, wars, clashes, upheavals. The situation is getting worse. There's no sign that Israel's siege of Gaza, as they call it, is easing. Israel continues to maintain a strict control of what enters and leaves Gaza in terms of products, medicines and people. Egypt also has a tight grip on that border, and often the border is closed for weeks on end. Air and missile strikes are getting worse. Many people are dependent on the United Nations, which provides a lot of relief supplies, in one way or another. If you're lucky you can get a job with the Hamas-led government, with the police or the bureaucracy. There are people engaged in farming and light industry. But jobs are few are far between. What's likely to happen next? We've heard from the Israeli defense ministry that the operation is likely to last for several days at least, so I think we can expect more of the same. This morning an Israeli defense spokesman said they believed Hamas has an arsenal of about 10,000 rockets. At some stage they'll run out, but so far the defense ministry believes they've only fired about a tenth of that arsenal, so the firing is probably going to continue. Israel says it has two objectives in this mission, which they call ""Operation Protective Edge."" One is to stop the rocket fire on Israel, and the second is to strike at Hamas. But Hamas is not just a military organization: it is a political organization; it is the government in Gaza. It runs schools, hospitals and clinics, so what does it mean to strike at Hamas. In the past Israel has talked about destroying Hamas, which no one in Gaza thinks is a reasonable or realistic goal. So this could go on for days or weeks. In 2009 the war went on for just over three weeks. I don't think this will go on that long, but it could last a while. What is the international community doing to calm tensions? It's not altogether clear. In the past Egypt had some sway with Hamas, but this isn't necessarily still the case. The Egyptian Prime Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is extremely hostile to Hamas, which is the Palestinian off-shoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, which he has mercilessly cracked down on. So he won't be shedding any tears seeing Hamas taking a beating in Gaza. The U.S. considers Hamas to be a terrorist organization, and to the best of my knowledge, does not talk to it. And therefore there seems to be no intermediary involved trying to defuse this situation. The Turkish government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has good relations with Hamas, and decent relations with the U.S., and that's one of the powers that could become involved. But as of yet there's no sign of this happening. So there's no sign of urgency in the international community to become involved. There are of course many other fires burning in the region: Iraq, Syria, Libya. Gaza and Israel is an old conflict that has frustrated many potential peacemakers in the past, and scares off many others who may contemplate it in the future. In Washington all we're hearing are the usual calls for restraint. They don't seem, in public at least, to put much pressure on Israel -- they're always hesitant to do that -- and they have very little means to pressure Hamas.","CNN's Ben Wedeman says there's little enthusiasm in Gaza for the flare-up with Israel .

"(CNN) -- Friends and family of Holly Bobo, last seen in 2011, waited three years for news. Their worst fears have now been confirmed. A man has been indicted on charges of kidnapping and murder in the case of the Tennessee woman, authorities announced Wednesday. Zachary Adams, 29, is being held without bond. A Decatur County grand jury handed down a two-count indictment of especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder. ""As this investigation continues, we are still asking for the public's help and support to help us continue to seek out justice regarding the disappearance of Holly Bobo,"" Mark Gwyn, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, told reporters. Because the investigation is ongoing, Gwyn declined to comment on whether any human remains have been found. Bobo, a nursing student, was last seen in April 2011. She was 20 years old. Her brother told authorities he saw a man in camouflage leading her away from their home in the small town of Darden. The Bobo case rocked the largely rural swath of central Tennessee, from those who knew the young woman to others who rallied behind the effort to find her. Hundreds of volunteers -- some on horseback and foot, others on all-terrain vehicles -- turned out to hunt for clues in Decatur, Henderson, Henry, Carroll and Benton counties. Many more attended memorial services or offered supportive thoughts online via groups on Facebook. The TBI and local and federal authorities have spent hundreds of manpower hours on the case, Gwyn said. More than $450,000 has been offered in reward money. Adams, who is being held at the Chester County jail, is set to appear in court on Tuesday. Prosecutors are evaluating whether they will seek the death penalty. ""Obviously, they're devastated,"" Gwyn said of the Bobo family. ""They've been devastated for three years. But, hopefully, this is the beginning of closure for the Bobo family, and they deserve that."" Missing woman was 'in fear of her life'","""Hopefully this is the beginning of closure for the Bobo family,"" says TBI director .

"Washington (CNN) -- Domestic dispute or terror thriller? Carol Anne Laletta Bond's story cannot be both, and now it may be left to the Supreme Court to sort out the dramatic and often confounding facts of this convicted federal felon's appeal. Put simply, we'll call it ""The Case of the Poisoned Paramour."" At issue is whether Congress may criminalize conduct -- under its treaty ratification power -- that is properly the domain of the states. Bond was given a longer prison sentence in the federal system after being convicted of violating an international agreement on the use of chemical weapons. Oral arguments in the case will be heard by the justices Tuesday morning. This case of toxic love has soap-opera elements, but Bond's lawyers argued she was being treated like an international terrorist or a rogue state engaged in chemical warfare instead of someone caught up on the wrong end of a love triangle. They say she should have been tried in the state system, where Bond may have faced a simple assault charge and just a year behind bars. The implications go far beyond this case, and could establish important precedents on the strength and purpose of the Constitution's 10th Amendment, which limits federal authority. It is also an issue roiling the current political debate, especially among tea party conservatives in this post-9/11, security-conscious environment. The appeal barely made a ripple in local media and had been all but ignored until the high court first heard the issue two years ago. Now the sequel promises to answer larger questions of the limits on Washington's power. Bond, a native of Barbados, lived outside Philadelphia and worked as a microbiologist. As a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case: ""Bond was excited when her closest friend, Myrlinda Haynes, announced she was pregnant. Bond's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband, Clifford Bond, was the child's father. She vowed revenge."" The woman -- known to her family as Betty -- struck back by putting her science training to ill use. The 42-year-old stole a dangerous chemical -- arsenic-based 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine, to be exact -- from her company, and obtained potassium dichromate over the Internet. Both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic, even lethal harm with very little physical contact. She then tried to poison Haynes some two dozen times over several months, secretly sprinkling the chemicals on an apartment doorknob, car door handles, and a mailbox. While she suffered no more than a chemical burn on her thumb, Haynes noticed something was amiss -- one of the chemicals is a bright orange powder -- and called local police in Lansdale, Pennsylvania, who merely suggested she wipe her car and doors regularly. Unhappy with that response, Haynes contacted her local mail carrier, and federal postal inspectors quickly jumped into the mystery. Surveillance cameras were set up and sure enough, Bond was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and car muffler, court records show. She was soon arrested. Professor accused of poisoning wife . Her lawyer said Bond admitted her guilt early on in what they considered a case of a woman emotionally traumatized by the betrayal of two people once very close to her. ""I didn't think that the federal government had any role to be in this case and I tried to convince them not to bring the case or just dismiss the charges,"" Robert Goldman, Bond's defense attorney, told CNN. ""And I promised them in writing that we would go over to county court and plead and let her do her jail time in county court. I tried to convince them that by misapplying the law they could jeopardize the statute even surviving the case. But they decided to go ahead and bring these charges."" Bond claimed she never meant to kill Haynes, but only wanted to cause her ""an uncomfortable rash."" The defendant also said her friend's betrayal caused an ""emotional breakdown"" that made her act in such a shocking fashion. ""The statute itself is so broad as ... to be meaningless,"" Goldman said. ""It prohibits the use of any chemical weapon. And what's a chemical weapon? It's any object, any item that has toxic chemicals. If in the case of an angry spouse throwing a can of Ajax"" -- a bleach-based cleaner -- ""at his wife, or vice versa, that would be considered to be use of a chemical weapon and the terrorism statute would apply. I can't imagine that the people that were involved in the treaty would anticipate such a broad application."" When a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court, Bond pleaded guilty and immediately appealed. She received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $12,000 in fines and restitution. An appeals court ultimately rejected her claims, citing a 1920 Supreme Court precedent giving Congress the power to enact treaties, even if it steps outside its traditional constitutional authority by usurping state laws. Before she could take the challenge to the U.S. Supreme Court, she needed a ruling that she had ""standing,"" or authority, to press her larger constitutional claims. The high court recognized that standing In a unanimous 2011 decision. She now gets her second date before the court and perhaps a final resolution. The Obama administration still believes Bond's federal conviction was valid. ""The Constitution does not prohibit federal prosecution in an area of overlapping federal and state authority,"" the Justice Department said in its brief to the high court, rejecting Bond's assertion the treaty makes an exception for chemicals used for ""peaceful"" purposes that are not ""warlike"" in nature. ""No reasonable construction of that phrase would cover petitioner's conduct. Petitioner's deployment of highly toxic chemicals with the intent of harming Haynes can hardly be characterized as 'peaceful' under that word's commonly understood meaning."" The government says federal law broadly prohibits a person from knowingly using a chemical weapon in a way that can ""cause death, temporary incapacitation, or permanent harm"" to another person -- exactly what Bond did here. Did Utah doctor kill his wife? Some see hope the right-leaning majority on the bench might use the opportunity to delve further into Act 2 of this legal drama -- the scope of the 10th Amendment, which states, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people."" In the broader political context, conservatives, along with a healthy mix of liberals and libertarians, worry that the federal government and Congress have been overly aggressive in staking claims to disputes they believe are best left to states, especially in the criminal arena. Many scholars and activists argue that some federal prosecutions are novel and the penalties are often more harsh, creating conflict and confusion with local efforts to ensure public safety. They see Bond as an unexpected hero in that fight to return ""the power back to the people."" ""There's a concern that a number of people have, really across the political spectrum, that we have over-federalized crime, that it is too easy for Congress to pass a new law,"" said Paul Clement, Bond's appellate attorney who was U.S. solicitor general under President George W. Bush. ""There is some outrage in America when politicians pass a law to create a new federal offense, without people stopping and thinking whether that's something that local law enforcement can deal with."" And it is not just felonies. Areas like gun ownership, zoning laws, environmental regulation, taxation, health care, and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of a high court decision. ""You now have a road map -- if you find the limitations on the federal government's authority irksome, any president has a simple path to get around it. Find any nation in the world, negotiate a treaty agreeing to do what you couldn't do otherwise, and if the Senate ratifies it ... then suddenly the federal government has authority it didn't have before,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, last week. ""The proposition that the Treaty Clause is a trump card that defeats all of the remaining structural limitations on the federal government is not a proposition that is logically defensible."" As for Bond, the current legal fight will not provide her much practical benefit. She was released from a federal prison in West Virginia 14 months ago, so a second high court victory may only be symbolic. She has not talked publicly about her case, but her trial lawyer says the husband is supporting Bond in the appeals. When last we checked, the couple was trying to overcome his infidelity and had been working to rebuild their shaky marriage. She had allowed him to visit her while she was incarcerated. The case is Bond v. U.S. (12-158). A ruling is expected by the spring.","Carol Anne Laletta Bond is challenging her conviction on a federal chemical weapon charge .

"Washington (CNN) -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will return to work next week after a nasty bout with stomach flu and a concussion sidelined her for three weeks. ""The Secretary continues to recuperate at home. She had long planned to take this holiday week off, so she had no work schedule,"" her spokesman, Deputy Assistant Secretary Philippe Reines said in a statement. ""She looks forward to getting back to the office next week and resuming her schedule."" Clinton spent the holidays with her family after working from home for the past week. Clinton's doctors, in a statement released last weekend, said they told her to cancel all work events and ""rest and avoid any strenuous activity."" Clinton was recovering from the stomach flu when she fainted and suffered a concussion. Her doctors have grounded her from overseas travel for several more weeks, but her return to the State Department paves the way for her to testify before Congress on the September 11 attack on the U.S. diplomatic office in Benghazi, Libya. Last week Clinton's deputies Thomas Nides and Bill Burns testified in her place at open hearings on the deadly attacks after Clinton had to bow out under doctors' orders. That did not sit well with some members of Congress, especially Republicans, who have been highly critical of the Obama administration's handling of the Libya attack and who have called for Clinton to appear when she returns to work. Clinton has promised to testify her next month before the before the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees about the findings of a scathing independent report that found ""grossly inadequate security"" and ""systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" at the State Department. Clinton said in letters to the heads of those committees that she accepted every one of its recommendations, including strengthening security, adding fire-safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high-threat areas.

"(CNN) -- Ten days after grounding its fleet of drones, federal border officials Friday says they have determined the cause of a January 28 drone crash and are returning the remaining aircraft to the sky to continue patrolling U.S. borders. Officials say the generator on the aircraft -- a $12 million variant of the Predator B -- failed, forcing operators to ditch the plane in the Pacific Ocean. Customs and Border Protection spokesman Michael Friel said in a statement that procedures in place for this possibility ""were properly carried out by the flight crew."" Mechanical steps have been taken to mitigate the vulnerability, he said. On January 28, a flight crew ditched the unmanned aircraft in the ocean 20 miles southwest of San Diego after concluding they were unable to return it to its base in Sierra Vista, Arizona. With the loss of the aircraft, CBP now has nine unmanned aircraft. In 2006, the agency lost another unmanned aircraft when it lost communications with it as it patrolled the southern border. In that instance, the aircraft was programmed to go to a pre-designated airspace and ""loiter"" in the event of a loss of communications. But it instead glided for 14 minutes, covering 30 miles, and crashed within a couple hundred yards of a rural home.","Customs officials grounded fleet after January 28 mishap .

"(CNN) -- At least eight people were killed and 10 wounded when a car bomb exploded Friday outside a mosque in the northern Syria city of Binnish, according to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Worshippers were leaving the al-Kabeer mosque in the Idlib province city after attending Friday prayers when the bomb went off, the group said. A YouTube video of the aftermath shows a blown-up car and dark smoke coming from the building. The video was posted by the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. CNN cannot independently verify the content of the video. Well over 100,000 people, including many civilians, have died in Syria's three-year civil war, the United Nations has said. That includes at least 26 killed Friday, according to the Local Coordination Committees. So far, all attempts to stop the fighting between government forces and rebels seeking President Bashar al-Assad's ouster have failed. The United Nations on Friday condemned armed groups for cutting off water supplies to the city of Aleppo recently, an action that left 2.5 million people without water. The water supply has since been restored, but in the statement, the U.N. urged all parties in the civil war to ensure water supply to civilians, calling access to safe water a ""fundamental human right.""

"(CNN) -- A second man has been charged with murder in the 2011 disappearance of Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo. Other suspects can expect police to be ""on their doorstep"" soon, Tennessee's top investigator told reporters Tuesday. Jason Wayne Autry, who is already in prison for an unrelated assault conviction, was indicted on especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder charges by a special grand jury Tuesday, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn said at a news conference in Decaturville Tuesday afternoon. Autry, 39, was a longtime friend of Zachary Adams, 29, who was indicted last month on the same kidnapping and murder charges, Gwyn said. Autry, from Holladay, Tennessee, has a lengthy criminal history, he said. Bobo was 20 when she was last seen on April 13, 2011. Her brother told authorities he saw a man in camouflage leading her away from their home in the small town of Darden, Tennessee. Information from ""several witnesses"" led to charges against Autry, Gwyn said. Investigators ""believe there are more people with information and possible involvement,"" Gwyn said. He told reporters to ""expect more announcements in the coming days and weeks."" ""These individuals know who they are, and I'm sure they are watching, and they can expect us to be on their doorstep pretty soon,"" Gwyn said. Although Gwyn has previously declined to say whether any remains have been found, he acknowledged Tuesday that her body has not been located. Investigators are ""doing everything we can to try to get (her family) some closure"" by finding Bobo's body, Gwyn said. The Bobo case rocked the largely rural swath of central Tennessee, from those who knew the young woman to others who rallied behind the effort to find her. Hundreds of volunteers -- some on horseback and foot, others on all-terrain vehicles -- turned out to hunt for clues in Decatur, Henderson, Henry, Carroll and Benton counties. Many more attended memorial services or offered supportive thoughts online via groups on Facebook. More than $450,000 has been offered in reward money.","Other suspects can expect police ""on their doorstep"" soon, top investigator says .

"(CNN) -- Throngs of revelers gathered around Times Square in New York City early Sunday to ring in the New Year amid cheers, glittering confetti and fireworks in one of many festivities worldwide. Crowds erupted in cheers, kissed and hugged as the giant ball dropped at midnight to mark the start of 2012. ""This is crazy, it's doggone warm,"" said Gary Grieco of College Point New York, who attended the unusually warm festivities this year. Grieco said he hopes this year is better than the last and outlined his resolutions for the New Year. ""Quit smoking, that's my promise ... today is the day,"" he said. From London to Samoa, the world ushered in 2012 and said goodbye to a year marked by natural disasters, economic turmoil and other highlights such as the end of the Iraq war. ""Natural disasters were pretty brutal and the end of the Iraq war was long overdue,"" Grieco said. Fireworks lit up the sky over London's River Thames as the clock struck midnight -- one of many festivities worldwide. As Big Ben chimed on midnight, the sky exploded with pyrotechnics to mark the start of what Mayor Boris Johnson promised to be ""the most extraordinary and exciting year we are likely to see in our lifetime in this city."" In 2012, London will host the Summer Olympics and pay tribute to Queen Elizabeth's diamond jubilee marking her 50 years on the throne. England was relatively late to the party, which began 14 hours earlier (at 5 a.m. ET) in Samoa, Tokelau and the Christmas Islands in the western Pacific. Samoa and Tokelau -- historically the last to celebrate the new year -- reveled in being the first to party this time round, after skipping west across the international dateline, missing out on December 30 entirely in the process, in a move intended to boost trade. From there, the midnight revelry worked its way west. The final ones set to ring in the new year will also be in the Pacific, specifically on the U.S. Midway Islands and American Samoa. New Zealand bid farewell to a year that brought more than its share of natural disasters, with fireworks bursting through a blanket of fog to light up Auckland's Sky Tower. Dazzling pyrotechnics above Sydney Harbour got 2012 off to a spectacular start in Australia, with huge crowds gathered to watch. In South Korea, the Boshingak bell in downtown Seoul chimed 33 times to celebrate the occasion, while in Japan, many families ate a bowl of long noodles together to symbolize the bridge from one year to the next. Crowds of onlookers cheered as fireworks and bright lights flashed over Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour and boats filled with revelers drifted below. In Laos and Cambodia, Buddhist temples struck their gongs 108 times to cast out 108 types of human weakness. The atmosphere was far more subdued in Vatican, where the pope presided over a Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. The celebrations then moved across Europe. Russia started by kicking off its new year in a grand way with fireworks over the Kremlin. Three hours later, much of the continent -- including Greece, Italy, France, Spain and Germany -- were officially in 2012, before England and Ireland finally joined in the next hour. Never known to shy away from a party, Brazilians in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and beyond celebrated the new year with characteristic flair and explosive pyrotechnics. They were followed one hour later by another large swath of South America that included Argentina, Paraguay and Chile. CNN's Kim Segal, Laura Smith-Spark, Holly Yan and David Ariosto contributed to this report.","Crowds erupt in cheers, kisses and hugs as the giant ball drops .

"Washington (CNN) -- A woman on the wrong end of a love triangle received a measure of support from the Supreme Court on Tuesday in an unusual case involving a domestic dispute, global agreements and local sovereignty. At issue is whether Congress may criminalize conduct -- under its treaty ratification power -- that is otherwise the domain of the states. Carol Anne Bond was given a long prison sentence in the federal system after being convicted of violating an international agreement on the use of chemical weapons. She would have gotten a much shorter sentence under state law. The case of toxic love has soap-opera elements, but Bond's lawyers argued she was being treated like a foreign terrorist instead of someone caught up in a domestic dispute. Beyond this fact-specific dispute, the case touches on larger concerns about the strength and purpose of the Constitution's 10th Amendment, designed to preserve state power. It is also a question roiling the current political debate, especially among tea party conservatives in this post-9/11, security-conscious environment. The justices are using this case to explore the limits of congressional and presidential authority, with timely, far-reaching implications. ""It would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much energy criticizing Syria,"" for its government's alleged use of chemical weapons in an ongoing civil war, said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, ""when if this court were now to declare that our joining or creating legislation to implement the treaty was unconstitutional. We're putting aside the impact that we could have on foreign relations."" Professor accused of poisoning wife . ""I just would like a fairly precise answer whether there are or are not limitations on what Congress can do with respect to the police power,"" Chief Justice John Roberts asked of the Obama administration's top lawyer. ""If their authority is asserted under a treaty, is their power to intrude upon the police power unlimited?"" Bond, a native of Barbados, lived outside Philadelphia and worked as a microbiologist. As a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case: ""Bond was excited when her closest friend, Myrlinda Haynes, announced she was pregnant. Bond's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband, Clifford Bond, was the child's father. She vowed revenge."" The woman, known to her family as Betty, struck back by stealing dangerous a chemical -- arsenic-based 10-chloro-10H-phenoxarsine -- from her company. She also obtained potassium dichromate over the Internet. Both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic, even lethal harm with very little physical contact. The 42-year-old then tried to poison Haynes some two dozen times over several months, secretly sprinkling small amounts of the chemicals on an apartment doorknob, car door handles, and a mailbox. While suffering no more than a chemical burn on her thumb, Haynes grew suspicious -- one of the chemicals was a bright orange powder. After getting little help from local police, in 2007 she called postal inspectors, who set up surveillance cameras. Bond was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and a car muffler, court records show. She was soon arrested. Bond admitted her guilt early on and claimed she never meant to kill Haynes, but only wanted to cause her ""an uncomfortable rash."" The defendant also said her friend's betrayal caused an ""emotional breakdown"" that made her respond in such a shocking fashion. Instead of being charged with simple assault, which may have gotten her six months to a year or two in state prison, Bond was indicted in federal court on two counts of mail fraud and -- the bombshell -- two counts of violating a federal law and international treaty on the possession and use of ""chemical weapons."" When a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court, Bond pleaded guilty and immediately appealed. She received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $12,000 in fines and restitution. She was released in August 2012. Did Utah doctor kill his wife? During Tuesday's lively hour of arguments, Bond's lawyer, Paul Clement, called the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act an ""odd statute"" that clearly exceeds congressional authority. He said the treaty was designed to deal with ""warlike"" behavior, not ""ordinary"" poisoning cases. ""I don't think that nation-states poison romantic rivals, attempt to commit suicide, or try to get rodents out of their houses"" using chemicals that might have everyday non-criminal uses, he said, like vinegar. Justice Elena Kagan was unconvinced. ""You are imagining a world in which judges day-to-day try to get inside the head of treaty makers,"" where judges might say: ""We understand that there's a national interest in regulating sarin gas, but we don't think that there's a sufficient interest in regulating some other chemical down the line. It seems to me a completely indeterminate test"" for judges to delineate ""what is in the national and international interest."" Solicitor General Donald Verrilli agreed, defending the treaty and law by saying, ""There can't be a 'too local' exception to the treaty power."" The Justice Department says federal law broadly prohibits a person from knowingly using a chemical weapon in a way that can ""cause death, temporary incapacitation, or permanent harm"" to another person, which prosecutors said Bond admittedly did. Verrilli dismissed a ""parade of horribles""-- hypothetical suggestions that a sweeping treaty could be authorized giving the federal government complete police power over the states. ""It seems unimaginable that a convention of that kind would be ratified by two-thirds of the Senate, which it would have to be,"" he said. ""It also seems unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution,"" against Bond, said Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""But let's leave it at that."" The remark brought laughter in the courtroom, but Kennedy clearly was not joking. Test your knowledge of the U.S. Supreme Court . Justice Antonin Scalia used the issue to delve into another controversial issue. ""Let's assume that an international treaty is approved by two-thirds of the Senate and the President, which requires states to approve same-sex marriage. All right?"" he said. ""Now, if that were a self-executing treaty, same sex marriage would have to be approved by every state. If it is not self-executing, however, it will be up to Congress to produce that result, and Congress would do it by having a federal marriage law."" The conservative Scalia said to do so would be ""dragging the Congress into areas where it has never been before."" ""If you told ordinary people that you were going to prosecute Ms. Bond for using a chemical weapon, they would be flabbergasted,"" said Justice Samuel Alito. ""This statute has an enormous breadth -- anything that can cause death or injury to a person or an animal. Would it shock you if I told you that a few days ago my wife and I distributed toxic chemicals to a great number of children? On Halloween we gave them chocolate bars. Chocolate is poison to dogs, so it's a toxic chemical under the chemical weapons convention."" Again there was audience laughter, but no smiles from the bench. Justice Stephen Breyer also worried about the scope of federal power. ""In principle your position constitutionally would allow the President and the Senate, not the House, to do anything through a treaty that is not specifically within the prohibitions of the rights protections of the Constitution,"" he told Verrilli, citing a 1920 high court precedent giving Congress the power to enact treaties, even if it steps outside its traditional constitutional authority by usurping state laws. ""And I doubt that in that document the Framers (of the Constitution) intended to allow the President and the Senate to do anything."" ""I am worried about that and I think others are, too,"" the left-leaning Breyer added. Among those attending the arguments was former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Justices prepare for hot-button cases - and hot internal rhetoric . There are about a thousand treaties signed by the United States currently on the books. Many academics and lawmakers hope the majority right-leaning bench will use this opportunity to delve further into the scope of the 10th Amendment, which states, ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people."" In the broader political context, a bipartisan sphere of Americans worry the federal government and Congress have been overly aggressive in staking claims to disputes they believe are best left to states, especially in the criminal arena. And it is not just felonies. Areas like gun ownership, zoning laws, environmental regulations, taxation, health care, and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of this high court decision. Some of Bond's supporters argue that some federal prosecutions are novel and the penalties are often more harsh, creating conflict and confusion with local efforts to ensure public safety. They see Bond as an unexpected hero in the fight to return ""the power back to the people."" ""The proposition that the Treaty Clause is a trump card that defeats all of the remaining structural limitations on the federal government is not a proposition that is logically defensible."" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said last week. Bond had won an earlier Supreme Court appeal, with a unanimous ruling she had ""standing,"" or legal authority, to pursue her claims in the courts. That allowed her to continue trying to have her federal conviction tossed out, which is the current issue before the justices. Her lawyers say she had been trying in recent years to repair her shaken marriage, and has come to terms with her husband's betrayal. The case is Bond v. U.S. (12-158). A ruling is expected by the spring.","Carol Anne Bond is challenging her conviction on a federal chemical weapon charge .

"(CNN) -- After the horrific shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, a parade of self-appointed experts tried to insinuate that people with autism are prone to inexplicable acts of violence because they lack the ability for empathy and social connection. This is because the shooter, Adam Lanza, had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism. These speculations are needless, untrue and hurtful. I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome when I was 9 years old. I had a lot of anxiety when I was in school, not because I have autism but because other kids would often bully and ridicule me. I was a smart kid, but I was very socially awkward. Thankfully, my parents were very supportive and helped me get through many dark days. I have Asperger's; I am just like you . I got in trouble in elementary school for flapping my hands and twirling. I even got in trouble for sitting in my chair strangely. When the Columbine High School massacre occurred, my music teacher told the class to be nicer to me because, as she said, ""look what can happen when kids are bullied."" That really upset and embarrassed me. The comment made me feel as though I had more potential for violence, which is clearly false. In high school, I decided that I wanted to make contact with other kids who had been diagnosed with autism and were cast out by their own peer groups and looking for support. With my friend Dan Grover, we built WrongPlanet.net, a community for people who wanted to share their personal experiences with autism. We now have more than 70,000 registered members from around the world. After the shootings in Newtown, as I often do when a major news event occurs, I immediately went to my online community to see what other people were saying. One member asked, ""How long before the media paints the gunman as a quiet loner with Asperger Syndrome traits?"" As we now know, it didn't take too long. Groups: Autism not to blame for violence . The same thing has happened before, like in the Colorado theater shooting, when Joe Scarborough irresponsibly speculated that the shooter, James Holmes, might have been ""on the autism scale."" He later clarified his comments, saying he did not mean to link autism with violent behavior. As the Newtown news unfolded, I noticed a huge traffic spike to our online community. When I checked the servers, I realized that people were finding the website by Googling search terms such as ""autistic killers,"" ""asperger's and criminal behavior"" and ""aspergers shooter."" That gave me a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. I only hoped that the searches indicated that people wanted to find out the truth: that autism is not connected with violent acts. Most people with autism who I know of are deeply sensitive and ethical; we just have trouble reading social signals. Research has also shown that we are less likely to engage in criminal behavior. If anything, those with autism are more likely to be bullied or treated with scorn because we are a little different. Fortunately, not everyone has been listening to some of the so-called experts who are implying that autism has something to do with Lanza's horrible act. A chorus of intelligent voices, including CNN's Sanjay Gupta and Anderson Cooper, New York Times reporter Amy Harmon, author John Robison and Ari Ne'eman, the first openly autistic White House appointee, has done well to dispel the misconceptions. Troubling legacy of Sandy Hook may be backlash against kids with autism . But the repetition of damaging stereotypes means more needs to be done to address the myths and stigma around autism, which puts people who are already at a high risk for bullying in even more danger. I was really touched when I saw the photo of Dylan Hockley, a 6-year-old boy with autism who died in the arms of his special-needs aide, Anne Marie Murphy, in Newtown. In the face of such terrible tragedy, we don't need more senseless finger-pointing at an entire community of people. We need more than ever to find our common humanity. Remembering the victims . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Alex Plank.","Alex Plank: After Newtown shooting, some people say autism is linked to violence .

"Washington (CNN) -- Pharmaceutical giant Merck will plead guilty to charges related to illegal promotional activity for the painkiller Vioxx and pay fines and settlement costs totaling nearly a billion dollars, the Justice Department announced Tuesday. Justice officials said Merck, Sharp and Dohme Corp. has agreed to the massive settlement to resolve criminal charges and civil claims stemming from its promotion and marketing of Vioxx. The drug was withdrawn from the marketplace in September 2004. Under the agreement, Merck will plead to a misdemeanor charge for the illegal promotion and pay a $321 million criminal fine. The firm also agreed to a civil settlement under which it will pay $628 million to resolve allegations of off-label marketing and false statements about the cardiovascular safety of Vioxx. The federal government will receive $426 million from the civil settlement and the remaining $202 million will be distributed to the participating Medicaid states, the Justice Department said. ""When a pharmaceutical company ignores FDA rules aimed at keeping our medicines safe and effective, that company undermines the ability of health care providers to make the best medical decisions on behalf of their patients,"" Assistant Attorney General Tony West said. The FDA approved Vioxx for three medical purposes in 1999 but did not approve its use against rheumatoid arthritis until April 2002. The government says that for nearly three years in the interim, Merck promoted Vioxx for rheumatoid arthritis. An FDA warning letter was sent to Merck in 2001 for making the claims. Officials say that while this is not a record settlement, the $950 million agreement places it among the top five on record.","The fines stem from both a criminal and a civil case .

"Washington (CNN) -- On Saturday he was the comedian-in-chief, cracking jokes with reporters and celebrities at the annual White House Correspondents Dinner. On Sunday he oversaw one of the riskiest special forces operations since Desert One, Jimmy Carter's ill-fated attempt to rescue the American hostages from Iran more than three decades ago. Barack Obama isn't just the president. He's the nation's ultimate multi-tasker, juggling enough roles and responsibilities to make the average person's head spin. Over the last month and a half, Obama held at least five National Security Council meetings to help plan the assault on Osama bin Laden's compound. The days in which those meetings were held coincided with, among other things, an education reform speech, two political fundraisers, a discussion with the Japanese prime minister about that country's nuclear crisis, a long-awaited deficit reduction speech, and two meetings on immigration reform. The day before the last National Security Council meeting -- on April 28 -- the ""birther"" controversy came to a head. Obama made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room to release his long-form birth certificate. (Yes, he actually was born in Hawaii.) And in the midst of all the planning, the president cut a deal with congressional Republicans to narrowly avert a government shutdown. He also dealt with a series of devastating storms in the South. Has this always been par for the course at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue? Not really, according to Boston University presidential historian Robert Dalleck. The frenetic pace of the presidency is largely a reflection of America's role as the premier global power in the post-World War II era, Dalleck told CNN. Harry Truman dealt with countless domestic crises during the Korean War; LBJ tackled the Great Society and civil rights while fighting in Vietnam. But in recent years, he said, the daily pace has accelerated due to the rise of the internet, wireless, and other facets of the communications revolution. There's a ""kind of blinding rapidity"" in which one event quickly overtakes the next, said Dalleck. Our attention -- and that of the president -- is whipped from the latest economic crisis to the newest tornado wreckage to the latest protest or outbreak of violence in the Middle East. Faced with a pressure for constant response, modern administrations face times ""of great pressure and intense demand over a series of compelling issues,"" he said. ""(Abraham) Lincoln's burdens were as great as any president will face,"" Dallek noted. But the rapid onslaught of information from around the world contributes to ""a different sort of feel now."" Case in point: the execution of Sunday's mission against bin Laden's compound. Obama was able to ""monitor the situation in real time,"" according to White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan. That ability ""does speed things up and create a greater sense of pressure,"" Dallek said. Dallek questioned whether an older person -- including a more hands-off administrator such as Ronald Reagan -- could adequately function in today's version of the pressure cooker environment. He or she ""might be overwhelmed,"" Dallek said. Among other things, ""you need to have good health."" You also need to be constantly on call. Teddy Roosevelt would ""just disappear as president for months at a time and people didn't know where he was,"" noted acclaimed Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley. If Obama were to disappear for 15 minutes, people ""would freak out."" Current times are not ""uniquely oppressive,"" Brinkley noted, drawing a contrast with the divisions of the 1960s and the generations that fought World War II and the Civil War, Brinkley said. But globalization and the interconnectedness of the modern age -- while increasing the flow of information -- have contributed to an overarching sense of ""frustration and fear"" that the administration is now confronting. Wendy Schiller, a Brown University political scientist, noted that every president since Eisenhower has recognized the need for an executive office equipped to handle ""a wide range of issues quickly and responsibly."" Ike ""laid the foundation for the West Wing infrastructure of expertise that we see now working for Obama (constantly), and that infrastructure gives presidents the capacity"" to adapt quickly on a broad range of issues. ""The key challenge for presidents in the 21st century is knowing when to respond immediately and knowing when to take their time to manage a given situation,"" Schiller said. ""It is not just that Obama has been involved in such a broad range of issues and activities. It is that he has handled them each differently and appropriately,"" she asserted. The president's speech late Sunday night ""reinforced an image of a man -- as commander-in-chief -- who knows how to prioritize the nation's interests,"" she said. Schiller argued that the ""24/7 news media and now social media puts far greater pressure on presidents for an immediate response or reaction to national and world events because voters learn about (developments) much more quickly than they used to."" But while the ""informational time gap between the president and the voters has narrowed considerably .... the president incurs the same costs for reacting rashly or impatiently as his predecessors did in eras of slower technology,"" she warned. Does she agree with Dallek's assertion that an older person might be overwhelmed by the nature of the modern presidency? Schiller didn't say, but she did offer a quote from Alexander Hamilton: ""Energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government."" Twenty-first century presidents, she said, must have that energy ""in all senses of the word."" Above all, ""be sane,"" Dallek concluded. ""That's the watchword.""","NEW: Douglas Brinkley says modern times are not ""uniquely oppressive""

"(CNN) -- The proliferation of semiautomatic weapons in the hands of Americans of the types that were used in the Newtown massacre is sometimes framed as a public health issue in the United States. There is considerable merit to the notion of treating gun violence as a public health matter. After all, homicides -- around 70% of which are accomplished with firearms in the United States according to an authoritative study by the United Nations -- are the 15th leading cause of death for Americans. But framing gun control as a public health issue doesn't quite do justice to the problem. It's probably more or less inevitable that most Americans will die of cancer or a heart attack, but why is it even plausible that so many Americans in elementary schools, colleges, movie theaters and places of worship should die at the hands of young men armed with semiautomatic weapons? Americans generally regard themselves as belonging to an exceptional nation. And in terms of living in a religiously tolerant and enormously diverse country, Americans can certainly take some justified pride. Will Newtown change America's attitude toward guns? That tolerant pluralism was on display Sunday night at the interfaith memorial service for the 27 victims in Newtown, which featured priests from several Christian denominations, clerics of the Muslim and Baha'i faiths as well as a rabbi, a memorial that was led by the country's first African American president. But there is another side to American exceptionalism that many Americans seem strangely unable to recognize: Americans kill each other with guns at rates that are unheard of in other advanced industrialized countries. Britain, with around a fifth of the population of the United States, had 41 gun murders in 2010 while the States had around 10,000. The scale of this death toll really resembles a national security problem as much it does a public health issue. Consider that jihadist terrorists have only been able to kill 17 Americans in the United States since 9/11. Meanwhile, some 88,000 Americans died in gun violence from 2003 and 2010, according to the U.N. study. That means that in the past decade, an American residing in the United States was around 5,000 times more likely to be killed by a fellow citizen armed with a gun than by a terrorist inspired by Osama bin Laden. Consider also that there are cities in the United States today that exact a higher death toll from violence than the civilian death toll in the war in Afghanistan. Last year, some 3,000 Afghan civilians died in the Afghan War out of a population of 30 million, which makes the civilian death rate from the Afghan war 1 in 10,000. Yet residents of New Orleans are being killed at a rate that is six times that of Afghan civilians killed in that war. New Orleans had 199 murders last year, or 6 for every 10,000 residents. Washington, D.C., where I write this from, had 108 murders last year or 2 for every 10,000 residents, making it twice as deadly as the Afghan War is for civilians. The numbers of Americans dying in homicidal gun violence would be even worse if it weren't for the fact that some of the techniques the U.S. military has learned on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been imported into American hospitals. So while the number of people seriously injured in gun-related violent incidents has actually gone up almost 50 percent in the past decade, you are more likely to survive a gun shot today than would have been the case even a few years ago, as the Wall Street Journal recently reported. Analysis: Guns and the law . The number of deaths caused by semiautomatic pistols and assault rifles are not broken out in tabulations of the total deaths caused by guns in the U.S., but a recent study by the magazine Mother Jones found that in the 62 mass shootings in the United States carried out during the past three decades the vast majority were carried out with semiautomatic pistols or assault rifles, most of which had been obtained legally. Legislation to control the spread of deadly semiautomatic weapons will not, of course, eliminate such violence. Critics of efforts to tighten gun laws can point to Norway, which has very tough gun control laws, and yet Anders Breivik was able to acquire semiautomatic weapons and kill dozens of people in and around Oslo last year. But Breivik was, in fact, an exceptional case and the murder rate in Norway is still eight times lower than in the U.S. The Second Amendment is, of course, very much part of the American fabric. But the intent of the founders was that the amendment protected the rights of citizens to bear arms in a militia for their collective self-defense. Today, we are not likely to need to organize local militias for our defense now we have something called the Pentagon. Semiautomatic handguns and semiautomatic assault rifles that fire many rounds in a minute were not envisaged by the founders nor do they do much more to enhance self-defense than an ordinary pistol or rifle. Such semiautomatic weapons also are not much use for hunting deer and the like. But they are very good for killing lots of Americans quickly. Do you own a gun that fell under the now-expired federal weapons ban? If the murder of 20 small children in Newtown is not an opportunity for the country to challenge the theological position of the gun lobby that the Second Amendment allows pretty much any American to possess military-style weaponry, when will that day ever come?","Peter Bergen: Gun violence is sometimes called a public health issue in the U.S.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The banners hanging on Israeli street corners boast of the ""Unbreakable Alliance"" with the United States, and the Stars and Stripes is flying side by side with the Star of David all across Jerusalem. It is a proud moment for the host nation. But as President Barack Obama heads to Israel and the West Bank for the first time since moving into the White House, there is no expectation of any significant policy breakthroughs and countless questions about his frosty relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""It is the most dysfunctional relationship in the history of U.S.-Israeli relations,"" former U.S. Mideast negotiator Aaron David Miller told CNN. ""There is no real sense of confidence or trust. There is no capacity to give the other the benefit of the doubt."" Miller: Obama's Israel trip about legacy . And yet, Miller sees a chance that this meeting, on Netanyahu's turf, could at least usher in a period of greater cooperation if not personal warmth. ""I think both have decided for different reasons that it is time to test the proposition that they can work together."" The prime minister clearly supported Obama's Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, in last year's U.S. election, and he has made clear at times he does not think the American president understands Israel's security challenges. Obama, in turn, was recorded on an open microphone bemoaning having to deal with Netanyahu. And the White House has compiled a list of what it sees as slights by the Netanyahu government, including issuing permits for settlement building during a visit here by Vice President Joe Biden. And yet, the crowded and messy issues agenda, and the fact the two leaders need each other both for policy and domestic political reasons, is why some like Miller see the possibility of a more cooperative relationship. Obama, said Miller, ""doesn't want to be the American president on whose watch Iran either gets the bomb or he needs to bomb. And he doesn't want to be the American president on whose watch the two-state solution formally expires."" On eve of Israel trip, Obama tells Iran to disarm . An eye on history . Netanyahu is perhaps chastened a bit by his own recent elections, just now forming a new coalition that nudged his government somewhat to the left. Not to mention a concern he shares with Obama: an eye on history. ""The clock is running down for both of these guys,"" said Miller, a former State Department Middle East hand. ""He (Netanyahu) wants to be viewed as the prime minister who did something and not a do-nothing leader. I think that combined with the likelihood the new Israeli government is a tad more pragmatic than the first Bibi government suggest there are some broad areas for cooperation."" Ambassador: Trip shows Obama's ties with Israel . A look at the regional map gives a better perspective of the messy state of the neighborhood and the urgency of the Obama-Netanyahu meeting. The major topics: . Iran: Obama made clear in recent days he believes he has a year or so before Iran reaches the tipping point in its nuclear program, and he comes to Israel to make the case Netanyahu needs to give diplomacy more time. While skeptical there can be a negotiated solution, Israeli officials say Netanyahu is open to months of additional diplomacy but hopes to get a firmer commitment from Obama on when the United States would shift to military options. Syria: Israel is a critical source of intelligence to the United States about developments within Syria, including movement of regime military assets. While long on record, even before the Obama White House, in saying it was time for Bashar al-Assad's regime to yield power, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has Israel nervous about possible regime change in Syria. Still, the Obama administration is now saying it would not discourage allies from doing more to help the Syrian opposition. Weapons movement in Syria an issue as Obama visits Israel . The Israeli-Palestinian dispute: White House officials say Obama is not carrying a new peace initiative and is hardly optimistic there is solid ground to try to revive negotiations. Most of all, the president's aides say, he wants to assess how prepared, if at all, Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas are to return to negotiations. Because the prospects for that are considered so low, the dispute that often has dominated any U.S. presidential visit to the region is now almost a back-burner issue. Almost. ""I know the president really believes that Arab-Israeli peace is important to America,"" said Shibley Telhami, a Middle East scholar who leads the University of Maryland's Sadat Center. ""Although I am not sure he fully understands what that means in terms of commitment."" Visits to Ramallah, Gaza and several Israeli settlements in the West Bank in recent days bring constant evidence that tensions are increasing again, including some rock attacks on settlers on roads that run between Israeli and Palestinian neighborhoods. Abdallah Abu Rahma, a Palestinian political organizer, said during a weekend conversation in Ramallah that he constantly preaches nonviolent demonstrations as the best way to air grievances and put pressure on Palestinian leaders and get the attention of Obama. Rahma argues Netanyahu would benefit politically from any Palestinian violence. But he says he senses growing frustration and worries his advice may not always be heeded. Wanted: More action, fewer words . ""At the beginning there was hope for him,"" he said of the U.S. president. ""But it was just words, and Palestinians are tired of more words."" Nonviolent resistance key to Middle East breakthrough . Palestinians want Obama to prove there are consequences if his call for an Israeli settlement freeze is again ignored -- as it is being ignored at this very moment with construction of subdivisions. And their grievances are evident in more personal ways: Posters on Ramallah streets sarcastically advise Obama not to bring his smartphone because Israel does not allow 3G or better service in the Palestinian territories. The nagging sense of rising tensions can be heard in the form of gunfire a short drive from Ramallah in an industrial area tucked between Israeli settlements. Up one dusty road, the Caliber 3 security training academy is tucked into the hillside. Inside, there are several ranges where students fire live ammunition, as well as indoor gymnasium space for hand-to-hand combat training. Among the students as we visited: residents of a local Israeli settlement who are part of its security structure, and a half dozen men being trained for anti-terrorism patrols on the light rail system that runs through Jerusalem. The academy is run by Sharon Gat, a colonel in the Israeli reserves, who says beyond teaching students good marksmanship, he has to disabuse them of any complacency. ""Our enemies are very motivated to do attacks on us in the cities and in the settlements, wherever there are Jews,"" Gat told us. ""We are not waiting for the suicide bomber to come. We want to be prepared."" Conversations at Caliber 3 and in two of the nearby settlements eerily mirror those we had in Ramallah and Gaza: a nagging sense from people who have lived here a long time that tensions are building toward more violence. ""The security guards are preparing for attacks, and not for attacks from the Gaza Strip,"" Gat said. Laying the groundwork for progress later . While not carrying a dramatic new peace plan, White House officials say Obama hopes his conversation on this trip begins to lay the groundwork for progress not too far down the road. Given the mistrust, scholar Telhami said he worries about potential violence and a frustrated Palestinian political leadership. ""They want something concrete,"" Telhami said. ""They need a game-changer. They need a paradigm-changer. The president is not going to offer that on this trip."" Instead, Telhami said, as long as there is follow-through, he could understand the president's longer-term horizon. ""I think that's the way they have to approach it -- looking ahead, not just looking at what you are going to get out of this trip per se,"" Telhami said. But Gat says he sees no hope for a major breakthrough, in the short or longer term. ""I remember my mother said, 'I hope you don't have to go through the army.' I told her always, since I was a child, I told her I don't think that will true. And I'm not telling that to my kids. I'm telling them, 'Listen guys: these are the facts -- You live in Israel. You probably will have to go in the army.' ""","President Obama makes his first trip to Israel as president; later goes to West Bank and Jordan .

"(CNN) -- Pakistani news anchor Hamid Mir had been threatened by ""both state and non-state actors"" before he was attacked by gunmen, the journalist said in a statement read by his brother outside the Karachi hospital where he was recovering Thursday. Officials from Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency, ISI, approached Mir several days before the shooting and told him he was on a hit list along with other journalists, his brother said. According Mir's statement, the officials didn't say who drew up the list. Mir thanked the Pakistani public for their prayers and vowed to unearth further details about those he believed were behind the attack. ""I will fight until my last drop of blood and last breath to continue the fight to strengthen Pakistan, to ensure the freedom of the press, bring a voice to the smaller provinces of the country and uphold democracy,"" his statement said. Shot three times . The prominent columnist and political talk show host was shot three times by gunmen in a car and on two motorcycles in Karachi on April 19, his network Geo News-- a CNN affiliate-- reported. The bullets struck Mir in the intestines, leg and pelvis, according to police. He is now recovering after undergoing what his doctor described as a successful operation. His brother, Amir -- also a journalist -- said Hamid Mir believed ISI and its leader, Lt. Gen. Zaheerul Islam had plans to assassinate him, but the Pakistani military's public relations agency has dismissed the allegations, saying that ""raising allegations against ISI or the head of ISI without any basis is highly regrettable and misleading."" Since the attack, Pakistan's military has pushed for media regulators to suspend or even revoke the license of Mir's network Geo News over its coverage of the incident, filing a complaint with the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority. Reports surfaced Wednesday that the network was unavailable in large areas of Peshawar, parts of Quetta and in military barracks in both cities. On its website, Geo News reported similar blackouts in Okara, Murree and Dera Ghazi Khan as well. Mir condemned the move against the broadcaster. The shooting was not the first attempt on Mir's life. In November 2012, a bomb was found under his car but the culprits were never found. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. Militant organizations -- like the Taliban, have threatened journalists in the past for coverage that they view as unfavorable. A former newspaper reporter and editor, Mir writes columns and hosts a political talk show on Geo News. His guests have included members of Pakistan's ruling government and the opposition. Mir is also writing a book on Osama bin Laden, the late al Qaeda leader who escape from the Tora Bora mountains of Afghanistan he extensively reported on. Two Pakistani governments -- once in 2007 and again in 2008 -- banned him from appearing on Pakistani television. CNN's Pierre Meilhan and Greg Botelho and journalists Syed Ali Shah and Zahir Shah Sherazi contributed to this report.","Pakistani TV news anchor vows to investigate attempt on his life .

"Irbil, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi President Fuad Masum nominated a new Prime Minister on Monday, further complicating the country's intense power struggle amid a dire humanitarian crisis and a militant threat strong enough to draw U.S. air power back to the fray. In a ceremony attended by key members of the main Shiite bloc in Parliament, Masum nominated Haider al-Abadi to succeed a defiant Nuri al-Maliki, who had earlier vowed to hang on to power. It wasn't clear what impact the situation would have on the country, which is already torn by a threat from Islamist militants so brutal that they crucify people and brag about it online. But in a sign that al-Maliki wouldn't go quietly, he later appeared with mostly junior members of his party who announced that they would contest Masum's decision in court. ""I've never seen Iraq so bad -- ever,"" CNN national security analyst and former CIA operative Bob Baer said Monday, before the latest political developments. Here's where things stand after a few days of dizzying developments: . Tension in Baghdad . The new Prime Minister-designate, Abadi, is the deputy speaker of the Iraqi Parliament and a former aide to al-Maliki. Masum nominated the prominent Shiite politician for the prime minister's job on Monday despite al-Maliki's pronouncement earlier in the day that he intends to stay in office for a third term. Abadi will have 30 days to form a new government before he can formally take office. Abadi appears to be backed by leading members of the leading parliamentary coalition, including Iraq's foreign minister and the Dawa party's spokesman, who appeared with him at the ceremony formalizing his nomination. Whether al-Maliki would use force to retain power remains unknown. He spoke out against the nomination Monday, describing the appointment as ""null and void."" ""I say to all of you fighters on the front lines ... the army ... the police ... remain in your places and do not worry or be shaken over the constitutional violation,"" al-Maliki said. ""We will repair the mistake."" More directly, he added: ""No one has the right to do anything ... without my permission."" On Sunday, Iraqi forces and tanks surged into some Baghdad neighborhoods as a wave of troops swarmed Baghdad's green zone, the secure area where many government buildings and the U.S. Embassy are located, two Iraqi police officials said. Exactly what led to the surge remains unclear. But some believe the beefed-up military presence was part of a power struggle between al-Maliki and Masum. Kirk Sowell, author of ""Inside Iraqi Politics,"" said the end of al-Maliki's eight-year rule appears near. ""Potentially, I wouldn't exclude the possibility that Maliki would try some sort of coup,"" Sowell said. ""I would exclude the possibility that it might succeed."" Al-Abadi welcomed . Abadi's appointment met with international approval. British Foreign Minister Philip Hammond welcomed the move, as did Nikolay Mladenov, the special representative of the United Nations secretary-general for Iraq. Mladenov urged swift movement toward appointment of a new government. ""It is important now for all political groups in Parliament to cooperate in forming an inclusive government that reflects the wishes of the Iraqi people for security, prosperity and democracy,"" Mladenov said. U.S. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden called Abadi to congratulate him. Obama praised his Iraqi counterpart for naming a new prime minister-designate, calling it an important step to unite Iraq's communities and urging Abadi to create a new Cabinet as quickly as possible. ""The only lasting solution is for Iraqis to come together and form an inclusive government,"" Obama told reporters. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry similarly cheered the nomination in a statement. ""The United States applauds President Masum's fulfillment of his constitutional duties and urges the Prime Minister-designate to form a government that is representative of the Iraqi people and inclusive of Iraq's religious and ethnic identities,"" it read. ""The United States will continue to support Iraq's democratic process and stand with the Iraqi people in their fight against terrorism."" Airstrikes against ISIS . The U.S. military conducted airstrikes on four ISIS checkpoints and multiple ISIS vehicles near Mount Sinjar to help protect the Yazidi civilians in the area, U.S. Central Command said in a news release Monday. U.S. airstrikes against ISIS targets have dispersed the group's fighters and forced them to travel more discreetly, a U.S. official who was not authorized to speak publicly told CNN the same day. The airstrikes -- authorized by President Obama last week to protect Iraqi minorities as well as U.S. personnel aiding the Iraqi army -- also appear to have at least temporarily stopped the militant advance on Irbil, the official said. ""They had been acting with impunity,"" the official said. ""Now they realize they cannot travel up and down the roads in large groups."" U.S. and Iraqi aircraft struck ISIS targets over the weekend, killing dozens of ISIS fighters, according to officials. Also on Monday, U.S. officials confirmed the United Stats is shipping weapons directly to Kurdish forces fighting ISIS in northern Iraq. So far, the shipments have come from the CIA, two U.S. officials said. Humanitarian nightmare . In their effort to create a caliphate across parts of Iraq and Syria, ISIS fighters have slaughtered civilians as they take over cities in both countries. In Iraq, one of the most dire humanitarian nightmares is unfolding on Mount Sinjar, where tens of thousands of Yazidis have been trapped by ISIS fighters. Dozens of people, including 60 children, have died on the mountain, where the Yazidis are battling extreme temperatures, hunger and thirst. About 20,000 were reportedly able to escape overland to Syria over the weekend. Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights spokesman Kamil Amin said Kurdish forces were able to break the siege by ISIS and help stranded Yazidis board trucks, which drove them to the Syrian border town of Hasaka. They were then driven north along the Syrian-Iraqi border to Dohuk in northern Iraq's Kurdish region. Iraqi security forces also have been able to airlift about 100 to 150 people to safety each day, said Marzio Babille of UNICEF, the United Nations' children's agency. On Monday, CNN's Ivan Watson went to the mountain with Kurdish peshmerga fighters on an Iraqi air force helicopter that had to pass over ISIS fighting positions, guns blazing, to reach the Yazidis. ""They flew in shooting; they flew out shooting,"" he said. They dropped off food and supplies and carried about 20 people away to safety, hauling them aboard in a chaotic scene. ""These people were weeping,"" Watson said. ""There was not a dry eye on the aircraft."" 'Heroic' mission rescues desperate Yazidis from ISIS . Yazidis are part of one the world's oldest monotheistic religious minorities and have been targeted by ISIS. Their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and the ancient monotheistic religion of Zoroastrianism. ""We're working with international partners to develop options to bring them to safety,"" Obama said Monday. ""Our aircraft remain positioned to strike any terrorist forces around the mountain who threaten the safety of these families."" On Sunday, Iraqi Ministry of Human Rights spokesman Kamil Amin said it was possible that as many as 500 Yazidis had been killed. The ministry had also heard reports -- but had not confirmed -- that some had been buried alive. Who are the Yazidis? Why does ISIS want to kill them? ""It's difficult to be accurate about these numbers, but initially we have reported 500 Iraqi Yazidis have died from either ISIS direct killings or from starvation and dehydration,"" Amin said. ""We have heard some reports from activists and local journalists that some families were buried alive."" CNN is unable to authenticate reports about the Yazidi death toll or the allegation that some were buried alive. On Sunday night, the U.S. military made a fourth airdrop of food and water to Iraqis stranded on Mount Sinjar, according to U.S. Central Command. In total, U.S. military aircraft have delivered more than 74,000 meals and more than 15,000 gallons of fresh drinking water, Centcom said. Britain and France have said they will join the United States in the airdrops. A British C-130 cargo plane delivered aid to Iraq on Sunday, a Ministry of Defense spokesman said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The alleged murder of 16 Afghan civilians by a U.S. soldier could spur retaliatory violence in the United States, a law enforcement advisory by the FBI and Department of Homeland Security warned. The intelligence bulletin, which was issued Wednesday to state and local law enforcement partners, says ""there is currently no specific, credible threat information"" that extremists might strike targets in the United States. Karzai urges NATO to pull back . However, the document, which was obtained by CNN, notes the March 11 killings of the Afghans is the latest in a series of events in Afghanistan that could cause anger and possibly lead to violent action. ""The FBI and DHS are concerned that this event could contribute to the radicalization or mobilization of homegrown violent extremists in the Homeland, particularly against U.S.-based military targets,"" the bulletin said. The document notes that the soldier suspected of committing the killings is based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, and states that in the past, extremists have viewed military sites as ""legitimate targets for retaliation in response to past alleged U.S. military actions against civilians overseas."" Massacre especially heinous, Army lawyer says . The law enforcement advisory also lists other recent events in Afghanistan that could incite violence in the United States, including the February burning of Qurans and other religious texts by U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan and a video that surfaced in January which appeared to show U.S. Marines urinating on the bodies of Taliban fighters. The Quran burning sparked protests that left as many as 40 people dead, including six U.S. servicemembers. U.S. officials also have promised a full investigation into the deaths of the 16 civilians. According to the bulletin, it's unlikely that any one of these events alone would lead to violence in the United States, but it noted they will be used in ""violent extremist propaganda and could contribute to an individual's radicalization to violence."" The FBI and DHS called on local law enforcement to be vigilant for possible violence, particularly against U.S. military targets.","Department of Homeland Security and FBI warn of possible violence in U.S.

"(CNN) -- Nearly 500 cases of Norovirus have been reported on two Florida-based Princess Cruises ships, the cruise line said Sunday. The 499 cases occurred on the Ruby Princess and the Crown Princess, both based out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said cruise line spokeswoman Julie Benson. On Saturday, the Crown Princess returned from a Caribbean cruise with 364 sick passengers and 30 sick crew members, she said. In all, about 3,100 people were on board. Sunday morning, the 3,000 passengers and crew on board the Ruby Princess disembarked, Benson said. Of those on board, 92 passengers and 13 crew members were reported ill. ""We're working in close cooperation with the CDC to identify the cause,"" Benson said. Investigators with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been on board both vessels and monitoring cleaning procedures, she said. The Crown Princess was cleaned Saturday and has returned to sea, she said. The Ruby Princess was also set to return to sea Sunday afternoon. Passengers on both departing cruises are notified of the outbreak and cleaning, she said, and advised of protective measures. Norovirus causes symptoms including diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain, according to the CDC. It is spread from person to person through contaminated food or water or by touching contaminated surfaces.

"London (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama is this week hosting fifty African leaders in Washington D.C. It's an event the White House has dubbed ""historic,"" and it's designed to promote trade and investment. But as the summit launched Monday, the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history was intensifying in Western Africa. Two VIPs -- Nobel Peace prize recipient and president of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and her Serra Leone counterpart Ernest Bai Koroma -- canceled their trips. Instead, they chose to stay in their home countries and deal with a health crisis that has so far claimed nearly 900 lives. It has also dragged on the region's economies, and the economic pain is expected to get worse. At the summit's opening day, the World Bank pledged $200 million to contain the epidemic. The World Health Organization and West African nations hit by the outbreak have also poured $100 million into plans to try and contain it. But the Ebola virus has hit some of West Africa's most vulnerable economies, and poorest rural areas. The economic growth of Guinea, where more than 300 people have died after being infected by the virus, is now expected by the World Bank and IMF to slow to 3.5%, from 4.5%. Is the world investing in prevention? Peter Piot, a director at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, helped discover the virus nearly four decades ago. He says many unknowns remain around treatment, how Ebola causes death and how this can be prevented. Thus far, there is no proven treatment and no vaccine for Ebola, although one experimental drug has attracted interest after apparently saving the lives of two American missionaries infected. In March, America's National Institutes of Health awarded a five-year, $28 million grant to establish a collaboration between researchers from fifteen institutions who were working to fight Ebola. Other trials are also taking place, including by Tekmira, a Vancouver-based company that has a $140 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop an Ebola drug. According to Ian Jones, a professor of virology from the University of Reading, the appearance of Ebola on the list of bioterrorism diseases incentivises the investigation into vaccines. ""The military and defense regimes are certainly aware of this agent being a possible agent of bio terrorism and are working on methods to control it,"" Jones told CNN. Working against that, however, is Ebola's relatively low mortality rates and difficulty of storing of a vaccine when the outbreaks occur irregularly. ""The economic argument [for developing a vaccine] is not strong and it's only really a moral argument,"" Jones said. ""And even then you could argue that the money would be much better spent on the infrastructure in the countries concerned."" Indeed, the World Bank's financial boost is designed to ""build up safety net protection measures"" for those affected, according to its vice president for the Africa region, Makhtar Diop. ""Further hardship"" is expected in the areas, where people are ""poor and vulnerable to begin with,"" he said when announcing the pledge. The scare factor . Investment and cross-border commerce is slowing as international companies impose restrictions on business with the countries where Ebola is present. Emirates this month become the first major international airline to suspend flights from Guinea, followed by pan-African airline ASKY and smaller regional carrier Arik Air. British Airways stopped its flights to Sierra Leone and LIberia Tuesday, due to the ""deteriorating public health situation."" While the full cost of such moves have not yet been quantified, a World Bank report has noted ""fewer international flights"" to these countries and ""lower revenues and financial inflows."" West Africa is rich in iron and gold, and Western mining companies have a strong presence in the region. But Liberia, where 255 people have died after being infected by Ebola, has closed all but major border crossings in its attempts to contain the outbreak. The mining industry contributes around 14% of Liberia's economy, with international companies such as ArcelorMittal, Hummingbird, Chevron and Exxon & Total operating many of the mines. Many have imposed travel restrictions on workers and are evacuating non-essential staff from the region. If this continues, ""there will be a sizable decline in production,"" the World Bank said. The agricultural industry has also suffered as rural workers have fled farming areas in the region. According to Jones, economic decline will also be fed by the ""scare factor"" of the virus. ""This scare factor permeates into the economy and has a much bigger effect that the hygiene issues themselves,"" Jones said.","The biggest Ebola outbreak in history is taking its toll in Western Africa .
The WHO has invested $100 million into plans to contain it, the World Bank pledged $200 million .
Ebola has also dragged on the region's economies, and costs are expected to rise ."
"(CNN) -- A tank storing radioactive waste at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in southeast Washington is leaking liquids to the tune of 150 to 300 gallons per year, the governor said Friday. ""This is an extremely toxic substance, and we have to have a zero-tolerance policy for leaks of radioactive material into the ground and potentially groundwater of the state of Washington,"" Gov. Jay Inslee said. He stressed that the leak poses no immediate public heath risk but said that fact should not be an excuse for complacence.

The tank was built in the 1940s and holds roughly 447,000 gallons of sludge, according to the governor's office. The Hanford site houses 177 tanks, 149 of which are single-shell tanks. The leaking tank is believed to be the first to lose liquids since 2005. The Hanford site is a 586-square-mile area that once played a major part in U.S. plutonium production.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Western leaders roundly condemned the downing of a Turkish military fighter jet by Syria ahead of a NATO meeting on Tuesday on the issue. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Sunday said she had spoken with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu about Friday's incident. ""The foreign minister briefed me on the specifics of the incident, including that the Syrian military shot its plane down without warning,"" Clinton said in a statement. ""The United States condemns this brazen and unacceptable act in the strongest possible terms. It is yet another reflection of the Syrian authorities' callous disregard for international norms, human life and peace and security."" The Turkish Foreign Ministry said Sunday it considers the action to be a hostile act. Turkey delivered the message in a diplomatic note to the Syrian consulate in Istanbul, calling the incident ""a hostile movement,"" ministry spokesman Selcuk Unal told CNN. Security Clearance: Can Turkey force U.S., NATO to attack Syria? Turkish search-and-rescue teams found the wreckage of the fighter jet in the Mediterranean Sea on Sunday, about 1,300 meters (4,260 feet) underwater, he said. Syrian TV: Turkish military jet shot down by Syrian artillery . They have not reached the wreck yet, he added. There was no word about survivors of the two-man crew. ""We will work with Turkey and other partners to hold the Assad regime accountable,"" Clinton said of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""Turkey has been a leader in the international community's effort to address the Syrian regime's violence against its own people."" The incident raises the temperature between the two regional powers significantly. Syria gave no warning before shooting down the F-4 Phantom jet which strayed into its territory, Davutoglu said Sunday in an appearance filled with tough talk against Syria. He accused Syria of spreading ""disinformation"" about the incident. ""They have created the impression that Syria felt like it was an act of aggression and they shot it down. ... from our perspective that's not the case,"" Davutoglu told reporters. The plane in the Friday incident was unarmed, not sending hostile signals, and identifiable as Turkish, he said. ""You have to first send a caution, a warning,"" he said in the first detailed Turkish statement on the international incident. ""If the warning doesn't work, you scramble your planes, you send a stronger signal, you force the plane to land. There wasn't enough time to do any of that in the time that our plane was in Syrian airspace."" ""We have to question how it is that an unarmed, solo flight got this response from the Syrians,"" he said. He said the fighter jet was in international airspace when it was fired upon. It had strayed into Syrian territory in a ""short, unintentional violation,"" but was notified by the Turkish side that it had crossed the line, and returned to international airspace, Davutoglu said. Turkey will respond ""decisively,"" but within international law, the foreign minister vowed, saying: ""It's a fine line."" Top Turkish officials in meetings after Syria downs Turkish jet . Turkey took its case to NATO, a spokeswoman for the alliance confirmed. Turkey, a key member of the group, is expected to make a presentation on the incident in Brussels Tuesday. It called for the meeting under NATO's Article 4, which deals with what happens when the ""territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened."" British Foreign Minister William Hague Sunday called the incident ""outrageous"" and said he condemned it wholeheatedly."" ""The Assad regime should not make the mistake of believing that it can act with impunity. It will be held to account for its behavior,"" Hague said. The plane was participating in a test of Turkey's national radar system, Davutoglu said. Turkish boats and helicopters had been searching for the two-man crew inside Syrian waters, he said. He said the search-and-rescue mission was not a joint operation with Syria, but was being coordinated with Damascus because it is in their territory. Davutoglu has also spoken with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, France, Russia and Iran, and the European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton since the incident, Unal told CNN Saturday. The Syrian military shot down the plane Friday as it flew just off the Mediterranean coast, Syria said. A Syrian military spokesman said anti-aircraft artillery shot down what was an unidentified aircraft that entered its airspace at a very low altitude and high speed. While on fire, the jet fell into the sea 10 kilometers, or more than six miles, from the shore of the town of Um Al-Tuyoor, the spokesman said. Diplomat to world: Raise pressure to stop Syrian violence . On Saturday, Syrian state news agency SANA quoted a military spokesman as saying ""the target turned out to be a Turkish military plane that entered Syrian airspace and was dealt with according to laws observed in such cases."" The U.N.'s Ban expressed his ""deep concern"" about the situation and the potential implications for the region during a phone call with Davutoglu on Saturday, the United Nations said. He commended Turkey for the ""restraint"" it has shown. The Turkish government called an emergency meeting after the warplane went missing near the border. The Turkish military said the plane took off from Malatya Erhac Center and lost radar communication over the sea near Hatay province, which borders Syria. The jet's disappearance could spark an international crisis. Relations between the two neighbors have already deteriorated amid the bloody uprising against President al-Assad's regime. Erdogan has repeatedly called on al-Assad to step down, and Turkey has withdrawn its diplomats from Damascus. Davutoglu pointedly refused to express support for al-Assad on Sunday, saying Turkey stands with ""the Syrian people."" ""This tension is not between Turkey and the Syrian people. There is a regime in Syria which oppresses its people,"" he said. However, Turkish President Abdullah Gul suggested the two countries were still liaising despite their differences. ""We pulled out representatives from Syria because it was not safe. This does not mean we are not in contact with them (the Syrians),"" he said Saturday, according to the Anatolia news agency. More than 30,000 Syrian refugees have spilled onto Turkish soil, and Turkey is hosting a number of Syrian opposition groups.

"(CNN) -- The next time an Israeli official petitions the U.S. government to release Jonathan Pollard from prison, we should tell our friend and longtime ally in an unequivocal tone: He will die in an American prison, so stop asking! Now, I know that's not how our State Department practices diplomacy, but there is no reason for the United States to be diplomatic with Israel when it comes to Pollard, a former Navy intelligence officer who stole secrets from this country and passed them on to Israel. Since he was convicted of espionage in 1987 and sentenced to life in prison, thousands of Israelis have made it their mission to get him released and sent to Israel. Why? So he could be treated like a hero? Let's be clear: Jonathan Pollard is no hero. Other than an American killing a president, he committed the most heinous crime someone from this country could do. You don't go against your own country by passing on secrets to another nation, even if it's an ally like Israel. This week, Israeli President Shimon Peres, who was in Washington to receive the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom, brought with him a petition signed by 70,000 Israelis calling for the release of Pollard. He told Fox News that Israelis ""feel very strongly about (Pollard.) And I understand their sentiment. But I am doing it not as a diplomat ... but as a human being."" Yet Israeli leaders have used their official position to seek Pollard's release. In 1998, Benjamin Netanyahu, in his first go-round as prime minister of Israel, demanded Pollard's release as part of his attendance at the Wye River Conference, an effort to broker peace in the Middle East. Various reports from Israelis who have talked with Netanyahu said President Bill Clinton either considered releasing him or actually agreed to do so, but later reneged. In 2002, Netanyahu even visited Pollard in prison. Pollard is a deviant man who sold his country out for money, and no sort of pressure from Israel or any other country should cause a single American official to relent. When asked this week about the request of Peres, White House press secretary Jay Carney said: ""Our position has not changed, and will not change today. Mr. Pollard was convicted of extremely serious crimes."" It would behoove President Barack Obama to go even further. He should say that as long as he is president of the United States, Pollard will never be a free man. While we are at it, we should also tell Reps. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, and Eliot Engel, D-New York, to pipe down. Those two are asking House members to sign a letter saying Pollard has served in prison long enough, and because his health is reportedly failing, should be released. Really? So is this how they feel about a member of our military who sold this nation out? America should make no apologies. Jonathan Pollard deserves to rot in prison. When he joined the Navy, he took the same oath every member of the military must: ""I, Jonathan Pollard, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I will obey the orders of the president of the United States and the orders of the officers appointed over me, according to regulations and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God."" The next time an Israeli official presses for Pollard's release, we should give them a copy of this and say, ""Enough said."" In 2011: Israel's PM pleads for Obama to release spy .

"(CNN) -- A passenger jet shot out of the sky two weeks ago brought the world's attention to eastern Ukraine, where government forces are battling pro-Russian separatists. But with so much fast-breaking global news, it's easy to lose track of the latest developments. Here's a guide to get you up to speed on the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash investigation and the conflict in eastern Ukraine, based on the latest CNN reporting. There still may be dozens of bodies at the crash site. So far, at least 227 coffins from the crash site have been transported to Netherlands. But as many as 80 bodies could still be lying in the fields of eastern Ukraine where the passenger jet crashed, Australia's foreign minister told CNN on Thursday. ""But we won't know until our investigative teams are on the site and combing the crash site for remains,"" Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said. ""And that's the grisly and sobering task that they must undertake from now on."" All 298 people aboard the Boeing 777 were killed when it plunged to the ground near the Russian border in rural eastern Ukraine. U.S. and Ukrainian officials have alleged that a Russian-made missile system downed the plane from rebel-held territory; Russia and the rebel fighters deny involvement. Investigators are having a hard time getting there. For four days this week, dangerous clashes in the area stopped investigators from getting to the site. The Ukrainian government claimed that rebels had placed landmines nearby. On Thursday, teams of experts and investigators got through -- but only after six hours of travel -- a journey three times longer than usual. The trip was possible only after high-level political agreements were negotiated with both sides, said Michael Bociurkiw, spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Even once investigators are able to get regular access to the site, there are a lot of questions about what useful evidence will be left. ""It is one of the biggest open crime scenes in the world as we speak,"" Bociurkiw said, ""and it is not secured."" Fighting is raging near the crash site. The MH17 crash hasn't put a stop to fighting between government forces and separatists in the area. Ukraine's military announced a one-day cease-fire Thursday to allow international experts full access to the crash site. But that came after days of clashes in the area. Heavy shelling and anti-aircraft fire in Donetsk sent many people fleeing over the weekend. Rockets launched by both sides have killed at least 16 civilians and wounded many more in separatist-controlled areas of Donetsk and its suburbs since July 12, Human Rights Watch said. The turmoil started months ago. After popular protests toppled Ukraine's pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych from power in February, pro-Russia rebels first appeared in Ukraine's Crimea region, where they seized key infrastructure. The region was subsequently annexed by Russia. Unrest then broke out in eastern Ukraine, a heartland of support for Yanukovych, where many people speak Russian and feel closer ties to Moscow than to Kiev. Rebel leaders in Luhansk and Donetsk seized key government buildings and declared themselves the heads of the People's Republics of Donetsk and Luhansk. In May, a referendum was held in each region on secession from Ukraine. Russia has showed no sign of backing down. In fact, quite the opposite, according to U.S. and Ukrainian officials -- who say that Russia is arming the rebels and pushing to take over Ukrainian territory. Last week, the United States said it had proof that Russia was firing into Ukraine. ""We have new evidence that the Russians intend to deliver heavier and more powerful multiple rocket launchers to the separatist forces in Ukraine and have evidence that Russia is firing artillery from within Russia to attack Ukrainian military positions,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said last week. Russia denies accusations that it's arming the rebels or aiming to annex more territory. To turn the tide, Europe and the United States are trying to hit Russia where it hurts: its pocketbook. This week the European Union and the United States slapped Russian companies and cronies of President Vladimir Putin with sanctions. Putin's longtime acquaintance and judo sparring partner, Arkady Romanovich Rotenberg, and the Russian National Commercial Bank are among those targeted. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has shrugged off the sanctions, saying his country isn't happy about them but will overcome any economic difficulties and become more independent as a result. This could be the start of another Cold War ... or not. Whether this is a battle in a new Cold War depends on whom you ask. Russian lawmaker Aleksey Pushkov, the head of the State Duma's foreign affairs committee, said via Twitter that U.S. President Barack Obama ""will make history not as a peacekeeper, everyone forgot about his Nobel Prize, but as the statesman who started a new Cold War."" Obama brushed aside such a comparison when asked about it by reporters this week. ""It's not a new Cold War,"" he said. ""What it is is a very specific issue related to Russia's unwillingness to recognize that Ukraine can chart its own path."" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark, Ivan Watson and Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","Official: There could still be 80 bodies at the MH17 crash site in eastern Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's administration on Friday issued notices to unions, warning them of possible layoffs in early April if the budget impasse continues. The measure ""may be able to be rescinded and layoffs avoided"" if 14 Senate Democrats return to the state Capitol, the Republican's office said in a press release. ""Without Senate action within 15 days, individual employees may begin to receive potential termination notifications,"" said spokesman Cullen Werwie. Walker has warned that the state might have to lay off 1,500 state workers if the Democrats don't return to meet a quorum to vote on Walker's so-called budget repair bill. The initiative would restrict the collective bargaining rights of many public employees, as well as require state workers -- with the exception of police and firefighters -- to cover more of their retirement plans and health care premiums. Republicans need a single Democrat to cross party lines and rejoin the 33-member legislature to meet the quorum of 20 lawmakers required in a vote on state fiscal matters. Only 17 lawmakers are required for most other issues. Letters to 13 public union heads, sent Friday by State Employment Relations Director Gregory Gracz and released by Walker's office, state that ""agencies must take action to decrease their expenditures to make up for the savings lost due to"" the delay in the vote on the governor's bill. While stating the cuts would not take effect before April 4, the letters don't specify exactly how many unionized employees could lose their jobs. Walker's office explained that individual employees had to be given a two-week notice before any ""permanent"" layoffs. Meanwhile, the state Senate has approved a resolution that would hold absentee Democratic lawmakers ""in contempt of the Senate."" The measure allows state law enforcement to detain the Democrats and bring them back to Wisconsin, according to Andrew Welhouse, a spokesman for Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald. But whether the contempt measure is constitutional remains unclear. The state constitution prohibits the arrest of lawmakers while the legislature is in session, except for ""treason, felony and breach of the peace."" Whether Wisconsin law enforcement would be permitted jurisdiction in Illinois to detain the missing lawmakers is also unclear. Democrat State Sen. Jon Erpenbach said Friday that the move threatened to derail any productive discussions between fellow Democrats and Republicans, including representatives from the governor's office. ""We were pretty close to an agreement"" but ""then the Senate puts out arrest warrants,"" he said, blaming Senate Republican leadership for impeding negotiations. The stalemate has appeared increasingly contentious in recent days as Senate lawmakers adopted a resolution Wednesday that would fine absentee lawmakers $100 every day they remain missing. A similar resolution passed a day later in Indiana, where House Republicans have imposed a $250-a-day fine against the AWOL Democrats who -- like their Wisconsin counterparts -- fled to Illinois in protest of a labor bill. Walker's budget-repair bill has drawn fierce and spirited opposition from unions, Democrats and others, hundreds of whom have demonstrated inside and outside the state Capitol in recent weeks in Madison. Some of them even slept inside of the building, prompting an order Thursday from Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge John Albert that barred demonstrators from staying in the state Capitol after business hours. On Friday night, the state's Department of Administration noted on its website that the Capitol closed at 6 p.m., with Capitol Police Chief Charles Tubbs speaking to five people who left shortly thereafter. Some 4,653 people visited the building on Friday -- about four times more than the previous day. One person was arrested for trying to bypass weapons screening despite repeated warnings, according to the state agency. The Capitol will be open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, with more large crowds expected. A Wisconsin Democrat was tackled by Capitol police Thursday night as he tried to walk through a door in the state legislature, which has been closed to the public. Nick Milroy, an assembly member, admitted Friday that he was ""aggressive in attempting to re-enter the Capitol, and law enforcement was aggressive in trying to keep me out."" ""This armed-palace environment created by Gov. Walker has everyone feeling very tense, and emotions are running high,"" Milroy said of the incident, captured on camera by Milwaukee-based WISN-TV. Police closed the facility after crowds demonstrated in and around the building, contributing to $6.5 million in damage and other costs since mid-February, according to Administration Secretary Mike Huebsch. Milroy ""was attempting to gain access without showing his ID,"" said Huebsch. He ""was using his own political agenda to get himself arrested and make a point."" The state is confronted with a looming $137 million shortfall at the end of the fiscal year, June 30. The state faces a $3.6 billion budget gap by 2013. CNN's David Mattingly, Eric Fiegel and Katherine Wojtecki contributed to this report.","NEW: The state Capitol was empty shortly after 6 p.m. Friday, a state agency says .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The political turmoil in Egypt and Tunisia has European tour operators scrambling to divert package tours to more stable destinations, and several thousand tourists have already been re-routed to beaches in Spain, a Spanish tourism industry official told CNN. ""We can't be happy about unfortunate circumstances elsewhere,"" said Rafael Gallego Nadal, president of the Spanish Federation of Travel Agency Associations. ""But the increase (in tourists) has arrived at an important moment"" as Spain recovers from a deep economic slump. In addition to the few thousand extra British, German and Scandinavian holidaymakers who've already arrived in Spain's Canary Islands, predictions are there could be tens of thousands of additional vacationers by May, Gallego said. For now, the seven-island Canaries archipelago, located in the Atlantic Ocean just west of Morocco, is the only part of Spain that can compete directly with Egypt and Tunisia for the beach vacation business in winter. But if the political uncertainty continues in North Africa into the spring and summer, the package tours diverted from those destinations to Spain's Mediterranean coast and islands could involve hundreds of thousands of additional tourists this year, Gallego said. Tunisia's beaches have been a prime destination for French tourists, Gallego said, and some of them could be diverted to Spain's coasts by next summer as well. Russian and Eastern European tourists who had holiday tours set for Egypt or Tunisia may instead go in greater numbers to Turkey, Gallego said, based on information that he said is making the rounds among tour operators and travel agencies. Egypt had nearly 12 million international tourist arrivals in 2009, compared with nearly 7 million for Tunisia, and 52 million for Spain, which is among the world's top four tourist destinations, along with France, the United States and China, the United Nations World Tourism Organization reports. Spain's Canary Islands had 11 million tourists, including foreigners and Spaniards, in 2010, a three percent increase over 2009. The extra tourists now diverted from Egypt and Tunisia are helping the Canaries to recover, said Gallego, who is based in Las Palmas on the Gran Canaria island. But diverting package tours from North Africa to Spain or other locations is not always an instant maneuver. A package tour in the Canary Islands costs about 30 percent more than a similar beach holiday in Egypt or Tunisia, Gallego said. So hard-fought negotiations over prices have ensued, in which the Spanish hotel operators may agree to a lower price which still turns out to be more than the tour operator and individual tourist were going to pay in Egypt or Tunisia, Gallego said.","Spain is one of the top four tourist destinations .
Thousands more tourists could be rerouted to Spain this year .

"(CNN) -- A pair of pilots flew the world's first manned commercial spacecraft over California's Mojave Desert on Sunday, though they were the only ones aboard. The mission was a test flight for Richard Branson's dream of affordable space travel and put his vision a step closer to reality, he said after watching the spaceship land. ""Now, the sky is no longer the limit, and we will begin the process of pushing beyond to the final frontier of space itself over the next year,"" Branson said, according to a statement released by his company, Virgin Galactic, which is behind the project. The spaceship, called the VSS Enterprise, completed a successful free flight from a mothership at 45,000 feet (13,700 meters) to a landing in Mojave, California, Virgin Galactic said. ""This was one of the most exciting days in the whole history of Virgin,"" Branson said Sunday, according to the company's statement. ""I watched the world's first manned commercial spaceship landing on the runway at Mojave Air and Space Port and it was a great moment."" His company said that the two chief goals of the flight were for the VSS Enterprise to perform a clean release from its mothership and for the pilots to free fly and glide back to its destination in Southern California. Preparations for Sunday's flight were extensive, Virgin Galactic said. The mothership, named Eve, flew 40 times, including what the company said were four captive carry flights of ""spaceship and mothership mated together."" Virgin Galactic said that other goals for the flight were also met, including the verification that all systems worked before and after clean release from the mothership and evaluation of handling, stalling, and stability. ""Virgin Galactic is now well on the way to becoming the world's first commercial space line with 370 customer deposits totaling $50 million,"" the company said in its statement. Boeing: Let us fly you into space . Virgin Galactic said that future commercial operations will operate at New Mexico's Spaceport America, where final preparations are under way for a finished runway inauguration ceremony on October 22. Eventually, the 60-foot long rocket plane will be taken 60,000 feet above the Earth by its carrier and fire rockets to propel itself into space. The test-flight program is expected to continue through 2011, going first to a free glide and then to a powered flight before commercial flights begin. Virgin Galactic has said that it envisions one flight a week for its spaceship, with six tourists aboard. Each will pay $200,000 for the ride and train for at least three days before going. About 80,000 people have placed their names on the waiting list for seats. ""What we want to be able to do is bring space travel down to a price range where hundreds of thousands of people would be able to experience space, and they never dreamed that [they] could,"" Branson said last year. Experts: Space tourism set to takeoff . He has said he hopes the technology will lead to a new form of Earth travel, jetting people across oceans and continents faster through suborbital routes. Shuttle layoffs leave some workers adrift . The spaceship was piloted Sunday by Pete Siebold, assisted by Mike Alsbury as co-pilot, Virgin Galactic said. ""The VSS Enterprise was a real joy to fly"" Siebold said Sunday, according to the company's statement, ""especially when one considers the fact that the vehicle has been designed not only to be a Mach 3.5 spaceship capable of going into space but also one of the worlds highest altitude gliders.""","The mission is a test flight for Richard Branson's dream of affordable space travel .

"(CNN) -- Hang onto your luggage, Boeing wants to fly you into space -- at least into low-Earth orbit. The aerospace company and a Virginia company have reached a preliminary agreement to sell seats on Boeing commercial crew spacecraft to individuals, companies, nongovernmental organizations, and U.S. federal agencies, Boeing said in a news release. The price of flights hasn't been decided but will be announced when full-scale development gets going. Virginia-based Space Adventures Ltd. has already successfully contracted and flown seven people on missions to the International Space Station, Boeing said. ""By combining our talents, we can better offer safe, affordable transportation to commercial spaceflight customers,"" said Brewster Shaw, vice president and general manager of Boeing's Space Exploration division. The partnership still needs NASA and its international partners in the International Space Station to sign on, because that's where the space tourists would go. Such flights would meet NASA's intent to promote space commerce in low-Earth orbit, Boeing said. Meanwhile, the aerospace company is pushing ahead on the design for its CST-100 spacecraft, which can carry seven people. The spacecraft can fly on multiple launch vehicles and is expected to be operational by 2015, Boeing said. ""We are excited about the potential to offer flights on Boeing's spacecraft,"" said Eric Anderson, co-founder and chairman of Space Adventures. ""With our customer experience and Boeing's heritage in human spaceflight, our goal is not only to benefit the individuals who fly to space, but also to help make the resources of space available to the commercial sector by bringing the value from space back to Earth.""

"(CNN) -- Fewer crowds and pleasant weather make autumn a great time to explore Europe, but for many Americans the destination has suddenly become fraught with worry and potential danger. A day after the United States issued a general travel alert for Americans in Europe amid concerns that al Qaeda is planning attacks similar to the 2008 massacre in Mumbai, India, many travelers may be trying to figure out what to do next. Still, the alert should scare no one from going to Europe, said current and former U.S. State Department officials -- a sentiment echoed by some travel experts. ""I don't think anyone should cancel a trip. The chances of something happening to a particular individual are very, very slim,"" said George Hobica, president of Airfarewatchdog.com, who just returned from London, England, on Sunday. Travel alert issued for U.S. citizens in Europe . Travel agents said they've seen limited impact from the alert so far. Two people with trips booked to London and Paris, France, have called Altour in New York asking what they should do, said Martin Rapp, senior vice president of leisure sales at the travel agency. He was able to offer the worried clients few answers beyond letting them know how much money they might lose if they decide to cancel. ""That's all we really can say since it's a rather nebulous warning,"" Rapp said. ""I expect more calls. Nobody has canceled yet; they're just questioning, seeing what their options are."" There may be few new bookings this week because of the alert, but most travelers with plans already in place likely will not cancel them, said Jill Jergel, a travel agent who specializes in France and works for Frontiers International Travel in Wexford, Pennsylvania. Not only do most affluent travelers like to go in September and the first half of October because schools are back in session, but it is a particularly busy time in Paris because of fashion week, she added. ""I've had one client say, 'Gee it's a little intense right now,' but I've certainly have not seen any effect on bookings,"" Jergel said. Not intimidated . American tourists already in Europe are on alert, but many continue to flock to popular landmarks, refusing to be intimidated by the threat. Susan Smith, who arrived in London last week from Texas to celebrate her birthday, went to see the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace and said the place was packed. She's also not changing her travel plans. ""The only thing we've changed is we've elected not to go downstairs [at the hotel] in the evening to have a drink in the very large lobby bar,"" Smith said. ""I don't believe in allowing terrorists to do what they do, which is to terrorize me. If we act terrorized, then they win."" Because the alert is so vague, travel agents said people should take the same kinds of precautions they always would when traveling: Be cautious, stay alert and look for anything suspicious. How to protect yourself abroad . Watch out when you go to a large gathering, added Marion Harbison, a travel agent who specializes in Germany and works for Sterling Brownell in Birmingham, Alabama. Most of her clients avoid the big cities and go to southern Germany, where she believes there is little or no threat. Travelers should also look beyond their activities and sightseeing. ""Just be aware of your surroundings, keep an ear on the international news -- people don't always do that when they're traveling,"" Jergel said. Meanwhile, travel agents are watching and waiting to see what kind of a long-term impact the alert will have. ""Certainly, we're always worried when something like this happens because it always affects travel. There are always going to be people who are going to say, 'I'm going to put it off,' "" Rapp said.","Alert should scare no one from going to Europe, U.S. State Department officials say .

"(CNN) -- Travel warnings from the U.S. Department of State didn't stop Faith Hentschel, 65, from venturing to Iran this May to visit the rustic sites in ancient Persepolis and the colorful bazaars in Tehran. A photo of Khaju Bridge in Isfahan, Iran, taken by an American traveler. ""I had no idea what to expect,"" said Hentschel, who spent two weeks in Iran after booking the trip through a private tour operator and applying for a visa. ""I was stunned with the friendliness of all the Iranian people. That alone makes me want to go back."" Iran is still a relatively rare destination for Americans, creating a niche market for only a handful of tour operators across the nation that organize group trips for travelers once or twice a year. And with news of the arrest of three American backpackers, along with the June election riots and government crackdown, Iran may be an even harder sell, some travel companies said. ""It really depends on the political climate and the perception of Iran,"" said Mike McDonnell, who operates the site BestIranTravel.com in San Francisco, California. The site books trips for non-Iranian travelers interested in visiting. His site saw a decline in booking travel to Iran this summer. ""It's already really hard to get to Iran in the first place."" Officials at the U.S. Department of State say travel warnings have been implemented on Iran since the hostage crisis in 1979, when militants captured 52 American diplomats and staff. The Americans were held for 444 days. Since then, the two countries have had no diplomatic relations. U.S. passports are valid for travel to Iran and visas are required to enter the country, according to the State Department Web site. Going with an organized tour group is the easiest way to attain a visa. Travelers who do visit Iran run the risk of being denied entry, U.S. officials say. In some cases, Iranian officials have prevented American citizens, academics, scientists and journalists from leaving the country, and even detained, interrogated and imprisoned some on unknown or various charges, the Web site said. ""It's made well-known that the destination [Iran] could be perilous for American citizens,"" said Darby Holladay, spokesman at the State Department. Last week, three Americans were detained after crossing into northern Iran during a hiking trip. The two men and one woman, said to be seasoned travelers, began their trip in Turkey and went into Iraq before crossing the unmarked border into Iran. The U.S. State Department and the Australian and British government warn against traveling into the border zones. ""Obviously, we are concerned,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday to reporters. ""We want this matter brought to a resolution as soon as possible."" Mudhafer Mohammed, owner of the Miwan Hotel, told CNN that the hikers said they had come to the area because they heard it was safe. Mohammed said he tried to discourage them from going to Ahmed Awa, a popular tourist destination in the northern Kurdish region of Iraq. ""I told them, 'Don't go there because it is unsafe for you because you're American and Ahmed Awa is very close to the Iranian border,' "" Mohammed told CNN. It is unclear whether the three wandered into Iran accidentally or intentionally entered the country. Pauline Frommer, creator of the Pauline Frommer's Travel Guides, said it's  safer when visiting countries in conflict to use travel companies and tour operators that rely on local accommodations and guides. She warned against staying in big hotel chains, which have been targets in recent terrorist attacks in Indonesia and India. ""When it's an iffy destination, it's always a good idea to try and travel under the radar,"" she said. ""You don't want to be a target."" Despite worries about safety, demand for visiting Iran has grown in recent years. Last May, travel writer Rick Steves shot a 10-day video of his visit to Iran in a one-hour special that launched on PBS. The project cleared up misconceptions about Iran and sparked Americans' interest in traveling there, travel experts said. At Geographic Expeditions, a luxury travel company that organizes trips to Iran, the number of participants doubled from 25 in 2007 to 50 in 2008. Spiekermann Travel Service, Inc., one of the oldest travel agencies that specializes in Iranian travel, has booked more than 350 tours to the country since it began operating there in 1995. ""My path is known,"" said Ihab Zaki, owner of Spiekermann, which is based in Michigan. He said he began offering tours after he visited the country himself and was awed by its history and art. ""We send all our paperwork to local governments and they know we are coming. I don't let my people roam around in the middle of nowhere. It's very safe."" But the recent uncertainty in Iran has caused interest to wane. Spiekermann's bi-annual trips to Iran, limited to 14 travelers, usually sell out. But only four have signed up for the fall trip. Far Horizons Archaeological & Cultural Trips, Inc. in San Anselmo, California planned a second trip to Iran for October after their first trip in May sold out. But owner Mary Dell Lucas said the trip maybe be canceled because travelers are withdrawing. ""What's happening most recently is scaring people,"" she said. ""Those three Americans made a mistake, but with us, it's very different. We are taking a group, and we are invited."" Lucas' firm and other tour companies say they take precautions.  Participants are required to abide by Iranian law, which means women must dress conservatively and cover their heads with scarves. A professor and a local guide, who are familiar with the country, accompany the American travelers. Barbara Bailey, a 73-year-old from rural Ohio, went on a two-week vacation to Iran last April with a tour group. Her favorite part of the trip was talking to the Iranian women at the local restaurants. ""I went because nobody has really been before, and I know they have a wonderful history,"" Bailey said. ""If you can get past the government, the people there are great."" If travelers can't afford to spend between $6,000 and $10,000 on organized excursions of  two or three weeks and decide to backpack, they still need to follow the rules, said Jon Dorn, editor in chief of Backpackers Magazine. ""If you're going to a place that's not like America, then do your homework on what's appropriate,"" said Dorn. Backpackers Magazine, an online and print publication specializing in backpacking, hiking and travel, reaches 2.5 million readers in the U.S. Dave Stevenson, who oversees the Web site www.travel-security-and-safety.com, said hikers should be equipped with GPS systems, satellite or cell phones and maps when traveling in border areas, especially in conflict zones. They should also notify relatives back home where they are hiking abroad. ""The world is a big place,"" Stevenson said, ""And there are always plenty of places to hike that aren't dangerous or war zones.""

"Robertsport, Liberia (CNN) -- When Alfred Lomax took up surfing five years ago, he was regarded as Liberia's first homegrown surfer. He's no longer the only Liberian catching waves, but with the sport still a niche interest in the West African country, some are touting Liberia as one of the world's last undiscovered surfing destinations. Lomax took up surfing shortly after the end of the 14-year civil war that destroyed much of his country. He says being out in the waters off the Liberian coast is like being in heaven. ""Nothing beats surfing,"" Lomax says. ""I feel so happy."" While Lomax may be a surfing pioneer in Liberia, he's not the only one taking advantage of the country's undisturbed coastline. Keith Chapman runs Surf Liberia, which promotes the country as a surfing destination. A dentist by trade, he came to Liberia five years ago after seeing the desperate need for better healthcare. He had spent four years working on a hospital ship in West Africa, attending to the needs of some of the most deprived people in the world. But he was drawn to Liberia and in 2008 the 37-year-old Texan settled there permanently with his family. Chapman and his few colleagues work long hours at a dental clinic based just outside of the capital, Monrovia. Surfing is Chapman's release. ""There's such a massive need that you could work around the clock. You need to set some boundaries,"" he says. Chapman hits the water in his spare time with a group of regular surfers at a beach close to his home. There, they can enjoy the waves without having to compete for space. ""Our surfing community is 20 at the largest,"" he says. ""In most parts of the world where they have surf this good, that's unheard of."" Robertsport is Liberia's most popular destination for surfers, with five point breaks -- locations where waves break offshore -- within walking distance of each other. Word of the uninterrupted surf is starting to filter through to tourists and some are heading to Liberia's beaches. Swiss surfer Julian Saccaron is in Liberia for six months with his surfer buddies, away from the more popular and more crowded surfing spots in Indonesia and Australia. He knows it's only a matter of time before more people discover what Liberia has to offer. ""We've already talked with each other and said just breathe it in, suck it in, because it will not be the same when we come back,"" he says. While Saccaron may want to keep the coastline a secret, local surfers hope their beaches will bring more tourists -- and more money -- to communities that currently depend on fishing for survival. But Liberia is a long way from being a mass-tourism destination. ""People are going to have to be prepared for some sort of adventure. It's not a place where you can get a package holiday,"" says Chapman. He believes it will be a while before there is a tourism boom in a country which is trying hard to rid itself of its reputation as a war-torn nation. ""I think once we get beyond that stigma, then more people will come,"" he says. ""It's still got a way to go -- public transport and roads are a bit of an issue -- but safety is not really an issue, crime is very low."" Nonetheless, the U.S. State Department urges U.S. citizens to ""exercise caution when traveling in Liberia,"" while Britain's Foreign Office advises against ""all but essential travel to all areas of Liberia outside the capital, Monrovia."" Both warn that crime is high, especially after dark. But while Liberia undoubtedly still has economic and social problems, Chapman believes surfers can help alleviate them. He encourages the surfing community to become involved in voluntary work and he hopes Liberia's waves will entice more humanitarian workers who can help to rebuild the nation. ""I'm sure there are lots of dentists out there who surf,"" he says. Lomax is hoping it's not just tourists who take advantage of his country's surf. He wants more Liberians to follow his lead and take up the sport. ""I look at all the sports in our country -- people play soccer, basketball, and surfing is not part of that,"" he says. ""So I decided I want to bring surfing to Liberia and make Liberia one of the biggest surfing countries in the world.""","Liberian Alfred Lomax took up surfing five years ago, shortly after the end of the civil war .

"(CNN) -- Lady Gaga reached an out-of-court settlement with her former assistant who sued for unpaid overtime, according to a court filing. Details of the deal were not revealed in a document filed in court last week asking the clerk to close the case. The lawsuit, which sought $350,000 in back pay from the singer, had been set for trial in New York starting next week. U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe ruled last month against Gaga's lawyer's request that the case be dismissed. In her lawsuit, Jennifer O'Neill says that she worked ""24/7"" as Gaga's personal assistant. O'Neill was employed in early 2009, and again from February 2010 to March 2011. After she was rehired, she was told her annual salary would be $75,000. ""Every day is a work day for her, so every day is a work day for the rest of us,"" O'Neill said, according to court documents. ""There is no, we're going to stay in, we're going to sleep. There is no, let's put on sweatpants and go out to the movies and be girlfriends. It doesn't work like that."" Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, testified that O'Neill ""deserves every one of her $75,000 that we agreed to. But she does not deserve a penny more.""

"San Diego, California (CNN) -- When I speak to college students, I always push two messages: If you work hard, take risks, leave your comfort zone and never give up, you can do anything you want to in life; and part of life is competition, because no matter what you want, you can bet that someone else wants it too. Competition. A simple concept and a beneficial one. It makes us better by forcing us to work harder. Sadly, it's also an idea that is going out of style in a society where students expect to get good grades just for showing up, where everyone gets a ribbon no matter where they finish, and where parents scheme to get their kids into college by lobbying state legislatures to create set-asides for in-state residents at public universities. When we're not hiding from domestic competition, we're trying to shield ourselves from the foreign variety. High-skilled workers don't want to compete with those from China, India or Pakistan. Low-skilled workers are just as afraid of those from Mexico, Guatemala or El Salvador. Politicians only make matters worse. While Republicans exploit the immigration issue, Democrats do the same thing with trade. In last year's Democratic presidential primary, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton tried to give displaced workers in Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania a convenient villain to blame -- the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both parties use lies and demagoguery to exploit fears and convince frightened Americans that we can fence ourselves off from competition. Build a wall. Impose a tariff. All so we don't have to put up with the annoyance of being forced to out-work, out-produce and out-hustle someone else to make a living. Imagine that. What people in other countries accept as the natural order, we continue to resist. What our own parents and grandparents came to expect decades ago when they went after a job, we think we're above. We've come to think that competition is cruel because there are winners and losers; so we spend all our time devising new ways to minimize the losing. Our elected officials should inspire us to be better people, and to learn to accept competition as part of life. Instead, most of them are too busy telling us what we want to hear so we'll like them better and buy whatever they're selling at the moment. Consider what Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, is pitching. He has just written a new 10-point immigration reform bill that he plans to introduce any day now. In addition to providing a pathway to legalize 12 million illegal immigrants, Gutierrez proposes to manage future immigrant flow by establishing a commission that ties foreign visas to labor market demand. ""Here's the guiding principle,"" Gutierrez said on National Public Radio's ""Tell Me More with Michel Martin"" in explaining the rationale for his bill. ""No American worker, no citizen of the United States, no one born here in this country should ever have to lose an opportunity for gainful employment at the expense of someone not born here."" As principles go, that one is dreadful. Gutierrez's bill has some good things in it, but it also has some things we could do without. A commission that protects American workers from competing with foreigners belongs in the second category. Think about it. Why should ""no one born here in this country ... ever lose an opportunity for gainful employment at the expense of someone not born here?"" Remember, these aren't illegal immigrants but legal immigrants coming on visas. Why should U.S. citizens get a benefit not from education or hard work but from something they had nothing to do with -- where they were born? If a job is available, U.S. workers should be free to compete for it, but not have it handed to them on a silver platter. Likewise, foreign workers who come here legally should have a shot at competing for that same job. Of course, protectionists claim that the playing field isn't level since foreign workers will often accept less money to do the same job, thus putting American workers at a disadvantage. Tough. President John Kennedy had it right. At a press conference in March 1962, while fielding a question about military reservists who were upset at being mobilized and deployed to Europe and Southeast Asia, Kennedy made the point that there is no level playing field -- not ever. ""There is always inequity in life,"" he said. ""Some men are killed in a war, and some men are wounded, and some men never leave the country, and some men are stationed in the Antarctic, and some are stationed in San Francisco. It's very hard in military or in personal life to assure complete equality. Life is unfair."" Exactly. Bad news, Rep. Gutierrez. You're no Jack Kennedy. How sad that our current crop of elected leaders has strayed so far from such straight talk. Instead, they coddle us and make us comfortable with our fears  -- all so we'll keep re-electing them. That way, they don't have to go into the private sector and compete for jobs with the rest of us. You see, our aversion to competition starts at the top. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Competition is a fact of life, says Ruben Navarrette Jr.

"(CNN) -- A broken rail caused a train derailment near Baltimore two years ago that killed two young women sitting on a railroad bridge, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday. A CSX coal train derailed on a railroad bridge in Ellicott City, Maryland, just before midnight on August 20, 2012. Elizabeth Nass and Rose Mayr, both 19, were killed ""when coal spilled out of the rail cars during the derailment."" The train had been traveling 23 mph, and the first 21 of the 80 cars in the train derailed. Seven cars fell into a parking lot. ""The presence in the rail right-of-way of the two fatally injured persons, whose unauthorized access placed them in harm's way, did not contribute to the derailment in any way,"" the board said. ""The NTSB investigation found that the point of derailment was a rail fracture several hundred feet before the bridge. The section of rail, which was examined in the NTSB's materials laboratory in Washington, showed evidence of rolling contact fatigue, a gradual breakdown of the rail-head surface."" The derailed train also damaged fiber-optic lines and temporarily disrupted Internet service at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, delaying the trial for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others facing terrorism charges this week, a base spokesman said at the time. The facility lost about 50% of its connectivity, which is serviced by satellite downlink locations in Maine and Maryland. The Federal Railroad Administration started a Rail Failure Working Group ""to study the effects of rail-head wear and resulting rail surface conditions"" as a result of this and other incidents. The Rail Safety Advisory Committee adopted its recommendations in April. CSX put a chain-link fence on the right-of-way in an effort to halt trespassing. There will be a public forum in 2015 ""to explore and educate the public about the dangers associated with unauthorized individuals in the railroad right-of-way.""

"(CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Sunday that the United States must establish a clear ""red line"" that Iran cannot cross with its nuclear program if it wants to avoid war. ""I think the issue is how to prevent Iran from completing its nuclear weapons program. They're moving very rapidly to completing the enrichment of the uranium that they need to produce a nuclear bomb. In six months or so, they will be 90% of the way there,"" Netanyahu said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I think it's important to place a red line before Iran, and I think that actually reduces the chance of a military conflict because, if they know there's a point, a stage in the enrichment or other nuclear activities that they cannot cross because they'll face consequences, I think they'll actually not cross it,"" Netanyahu told CNN's Candy Crowley. U.N. nuclear agency expresses 'serious concern' about Iran nuke activity . Concerns in Washington that Israel could launch a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities prompted a wave of visits this summer to Israel by several top Obama administration officials. Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, warned Sunday, ""Our answer to the Zionist regime is quite clear. In the event of an attack on Iran by the Zionist regime there will be nothing left of Israel."" He added, ""Considering the size of Israel and its vulnerabilities and also because of the high number of our rockets, I don't think anywhere in Israel will be safe."" Iran denies that it aims to build a nuclear bomb, saying that its nuclear program is for energy and medical use. U.S. President Barack Obama last week reportedly rejected Netanyahu's call to lay down a line that Iran could not cross. According to The New York Times, during an hour-long telephone call between the two leaders, Obama did not embrace Netanyahu's proposal to set a limit on the size of Iran's stockpile of close-to-bomb-grade uranium and launch a military strike if Tehran exceeded it. Netanyahu has shown growing impatience with what he says is a lack of clarity by the Obama administration on articulating red lines over Iran's nuclear ambitions. The administration has resisted pressure to take that step. ""We share a grave concern about Iran pursuing a nuclear weapon,"" U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice told ""State of the Union"" Sunday. ""We are determined to prevent that from happening. President Obama has been absolutely clear, and on this there's absolutely no daylight between the United States and Israel that we will do what it takes to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon."" Steps the United States and other countries are taking to pressure Iran are working, Rice said. ""We have just seen the imposition of another layer of the toughest sanctions that have ever been imposed on a country,"" she said, adding that Iran's oil production and currency have both plummeted 40%. ""And this is only going to intensify, so we think that there's still considerable time for this pressure to work, but this is not an infinite window."" U.S. intelligence officials have said they do not believe Iran has decided to develop a nuclear weapon, even as evidence continues to mount that the country is improving its ability to do so. Far from establishing a threshold for military action, the closest White House spokesman Jay Carney would go last week was to repeat the commonly-used phrase ""the president is committed to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon."" Atomic enrichment in and of itself is not a red line, a U.S. official told CNN following the telephone call between Obama and Netanyahu. But Israel feels a sense of urgency, as negotiations aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions have failed to produce an agreement and sanctions have fallen short of their intended effect. The issue has taken on a decidedly political tone with Netanyahu's call coming at the height of the presidential election season. The prime minister told CNN that he knew people ""are trying to draw me into the American election, and I'm not going to do that."" ""But I will say that we value, we cherish the bipartisan support for Israel in the United States, and we're supported by Democrats and Republicans alike,"" he said. ""This is not an electoral issue. It is not based on any electoral consideration. I think that there's a common interest of all Americans, of all political persuasions, to stop Iran. This is a regime that is giving vent to the worst impulses that you see right now in the Middle East.""","NEW: If Israel attacks Iran, ""there will be nothing left of Israel,"" an Iranian commander says .

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- Venezuelan cable television providers dropped a channel Sunday that has been critical of President Hugo Chavez, citing violation of broadcast laws. Radio Caracas Television, which lost its broadcasting license in 2007 and became a cable-only channel, disappeared shortly after midnight on Saturday. RCTV was the only station that did not air the entire speech of Chavez during pro-government marches earlier on Saturday. Diosdado Cabello, director of the national agency regulating electronic media, had called on cable and satellite providers to stop offering channels deemed to be in violation of the law. Cabello said RCTV did not broadcast the Venezuelan national anthem as required and failed to provide warnings before programs featuring violence. The channel denied the violations in a news release Sunday. It said the move to drop it was illegal and questioned the National Commission of Telecommunications' authority to regulate subscription-based TV. The government ""illegally targeted the subscription services by asking them to exclude RCTV International's signal,"" according to the statement from RCTV. The action by the regulatory agency is illegal because ""if the government believes that RCTV International has committed an infraction, what follows is to open an administrative complaint against the channel, giving RCTV International the opportunity to defend itself, as the constitution mandates and guarantees,"" RCTV said. Five other channels were also taken off the air, according to the Venezuelan Chamber of Subscription Television. They were Ritmo Son, America TV, Momentum, American Network, and TV Chile. The chamber's president, Mario Seijas, said the organization's position was to comply with the telecommunication rules that are in place in Venezuela. Chavez has accused RCTV of violating broadcast laws and supporting a botched coup against him in 2002. Before it lost its license in 2007, it had been on the air for 53 years and was one of several private broadcast stations that openly criticized the government. Relations between Chavez's government and private broadcasters have been tense. Last year, Chavez closed 32 privately-owned radio stations and threatened to close more than 200 others for a variety of infractions, including working with expired permits and operation by unauthorized personnel. The Venezuelan government says the closures are an effort to get all broadcasters to abide by regulations that are on the books, while station owners say the closures are politically motivated. The moves against the media have worried organizations that defend freedom of the press, as Chavez has also expressed support for legislation that would mandate prison sentences for people who commit ""media crimes.""

"(CNN) -- In the Venezuelan coastal city of Maracaibo, they're known as piranhas. But these aren't the flesh-eating fish found in some South American rivers. They're fast and ferocious thieves who residents say are increasingly attacking women. The common denominator among the victims? All of them had long hair -- until thieves came at them with scissors, snipping it off. ""You have to see it to believe it,"" Maracaibo resident Egmari Villarreal said in a video posted on the Panorama newspaper's website. ""We're not going to be able to have long hair anymore. As a woman, this is something traumatic."" Resident Sarai Madrid said she's seen it throughout the city. ""It's happening downtown, at the beach or at the mall, where you find a lot of young women,"" she told Panorama. ""The thieves grab them by the hair, pull out some scissors and cut their hair. Then they sell it at beauty or hair salons."" Mariana Rodriguez told CNN affiliate Globovision that she was walking through a popular mall when she saw two women coming toward her. ""I thought they were going to steal my cell phone, because I had it in my hand at the time, but they took out scissors,"" she said. ""They did not give me a chance to think or to run or anything. And when I looked, I no longer had any hair."" Maracaibo Mayor Eveling de Rosales told reporters that police were stepping up security to stop the attackers. ""As part of our operation of citizen security, we are giving them a forceful response, posting men and women to keep watch and stop this from continuing to happen,"" she said. Jairo Ramirez, Zulia state's security secretary, told the newspaper that authorities have stepped up patrols after hearing about the reported thefts, but they haven't received any formal complaints. ""I do not know to what degree it is happening,"" he said. ""I have not learned of any formal complaints of this type. I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but it is not very clear."" At least one such attack has also been reported in neighboring Colombia, CNN affiliate Caracol reported. Arlen Luna told Caracol last year that she was wearing her hair in a braid when thieves attacked her in the Colombian city of Barranquilla. By the time she realized what had happened, the thieves had already fled, and a chunk of her hair spanning about 20 centimeters (8 inches) was missing. From the robber's perspective, it's quick and relatively easy money. Hair stylist Israel Rodriguez told Caracol that synthetic hair costs anywhere from $40 to $160, depending on its quality. But natural hair can cost more than $500, he said. All the more reason to guard your tresses. CNN's Catherine E.

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- He fell into the jewelry industry 38 years ago almost by accident but Labi Kapo is today a master goldsmith whose dazzling hand-crafted creations cost thousands of dollars. His professional journey started in 1976 when, fresh out of school, Kapo entered a London jewelry store to pay the last installment for a watch he'd bought. But whilst there, the shop's owners asked him whether he'd like to work for them for a couple of weeks. The young man agreed and has never looked back ever since. Born in Lagos, Nigeria, Kapo was raised in London where he also perfected his craft by working at some of the UK capital's finest jewelry stores. After years of learning from his mentors, Kapo branched out and started creating his own pieces. Throughout the years, Kapo made several trips to various African countries, including Ghana, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, to learn more about the industry. ""Africa has been blessed, truly blessed, with abundance of all the raw materials in which to thrive for the jewelry industry,"" says Kapo. Eventually he decided to start his own business back in the continent -- In 2002, Kapo opened his own line, Akapo Jewels, in South Africa. Nestled in the classy Hyde Park suburb in Johannesburg, Kapo has spent the last decade designing and creating intricate pieces of jewelry for his elite clientele across the globe, including customized handcrafted pieces for some of the top auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's. When he's not designing unique pieces, Kapo spends much of his time teaching local youth the knowledge he has gleaned throughout the years as part of his efforts to help locals benefit from their land's valuable resources. Apart from teaching platinum manufacturing at the University of Johannesburg, he's also set up a business and training facility at his workspace. ""I'm one of those craftsmen who believe that when I'm teaching you, I'm teaching you to be better than me,"" he says. ""It's pointless to have all this information in my head. I need to transfer it to the next generation. They are the future so this is what my plan is and I believe I'm going in the right direction.""

"(CNN) -- A pro-gay marriage group can continue to picket Target stores in California but must do so 30 feet away from a store entrance, a judge has ruled. The retail giant had filed an injunction trying to keep Canvass for a Cause from picketing at its stores statewide. A California Superior Court judge in San Diego County denied that injunction but placed specific rules on what the group can do, according to court documents filed Thursday. The group can only canvas one store entrance at any given time so customers' acces to the store isn't impeded, the judge ruled. Also, group members are not allowed to ""harass, follow, stalk, or block movements of Target's employees, management or customers."" ""Target was denied a restraining order against Canvass for a Cause, citing there was no evidence volunteers were threatening or harassing! This is a win,"" the San Diego group said on its website. The group began picketing Target after the corporation donated $150,000 to MN Forward, a organization that supported the failed gubernatorial campaign of Republican Tom Emmer, who opposes same-sex marriage. Target has since apologized for the donation. Gregg Steinhafel, the company's chairman, CEO and president, sent a letter to Target managers and employees in August. ""We remain fully committed to fostering an environment that supports and respects the rights and beliefs of all individuals,"" Steinhafel wrote.

"(CNN) -- Like many of Spider-Man's victims, Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola was caught in a web of despair. As Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed home the winning goal in Borussia Dortmund's 2-0 German Super Cup triumph, the forward pulled on a Spider-Man mask and celebrated wildly. It was no less than Dortmund deserved -- victory at its home stadium in the traditional curtain raiser before the German Bundesliga season against an arch rival is not to be dismissed lightly. Henrikh Mkhitaryan's first half effort gave Dortmund the advantage on 23 minutes before Aubameyang sealed the triumph by converting Lukasz Piszczek's cross. ""We played very well at the back,"" Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp told reporters. ""The Bavarians did not have a lot of chances and we defended superbly. The engine is gradually starting to work well but we are still not at 100%."" While neither coach will read too much into the result given the number of absentees, particularly in the Bayern squad, the victory was particularly sweet for Dortmund. If Aubameyang was cast as the superhero, then Bayern arrived in town as the arch villain. Bayern, which has made a habit of plundering the Dortmund talent in recent seasons with the acquisitions of Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski, raced to last season's league title. Add to that a number of off-field spats, including Bayern's Bastian Schweinsteiger's ill-judged chanting which went viral, for which he subsequently apologized, and it's easy to see why these two clubs just don't get on. Bayern, favorites for the title once again this year, boasts one of the most talented squads in world football with Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery joining the Germany's World Cup winners in Manuel Neuer, Thomas Muller and Philipp Lahm. But its coach Guardiola is under pressure -- a pressure which has been mounting since his side was brutally dumped out of last season's Champions League by Real Madrid. When Bayern defeated Dortmund in the 2013 Champions League final at Wembley on their way to the treble under Jupp Heynckes, it appeared the club was set for a new era of domination. But Bayern failed to retain its European title last year and its form dropped off in alarming fashion after ensuring another Bundesliga success. Guardiola's side will begin its title defense with a home fixture against Wolfsburg on Friday August 22 and according to Lahm, a second half substitute, there is much work to be done. ""Many of us only recently returned to training and we also have some players injured,"" he told German television. ""It was not easy. We did not have that many chances but we are still in the middle of our preseason preparations."" Meanwhile, Bayern winger Ribery announced that he will be concentrating solely on club football after retiring from international duty. Ribery, who won 81 caps and scored 16 international goals after making his debut for France in 2006, missed the recent World Cup through injury. ""I am stopping,"" the 31-year-old told German magazine Kicker. ""I realized that this moment has come. ""One has to know when to stop. I have experienced so much and now is the time for others to come forward. ""You could see at the World Cup that we should have no concerns about France's future.""","Bayern Munich beaten by Borussia Dortmund in German Super Cup final .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel has announced plans to build hundreds of new homes in the disputed regions of East Jerusalem and the West Bank, a move that has drawn sharp criticism. The country's Land Administration on Monday published notices for bids to erect 609 units in Pisgat Zeev and 606 units in Ramot in East Jerusalem. It also reoffered bids for 72 homes in Ariel in the West Bank. Israel's building of settlements in the West Bank and housing construction in East Jerusalem have been major stumbling blocks in forging peace efforts and a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. Read more: Israel to build housing in West Bank . Palestinian government spokeswoman Nour Odeh said the Palestinians ""don't recognize the legitimacy of any settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territories, especially in East Jerusalem."" ""We regard this announcement as a new expression for Israeli defiance of will of the international community. Israel is creating realities on the ground that contradicts the spirit and letter of signed agreements and relevant resolutions, and it is the responsibility of all responsible international actions to put an end to this assault on the prospects of peace and Palestinian rights to freedom and independence,"" she said. Mohammed Shtayyeh, a leader in the Palestinian movement Fatah, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, saying, ""This is all Netanyahu and Lieberman have to offer: the destruction of the two-state solution and the imposition of an apartheid regime."" Ariel Rosenberg, the spokesman for Israel's Ministry of Housing and Construction, said the government made the announcement last year of its intention to build in Pisgat Zeev and Ramot. Rosenberg said it has taken a year for the tender to be announced because of an argument over infrastructure development. But Israeli group Peace Now, a critic of settlement policies, called the announcement the ""true answer"" from Netanyahu to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his ""strong commitment"" to a two-state solution. ""It seems that Netanyahu is afraid of the new administration that is being elected today in the U.S. and he has chosen the day of election to publish the tenders so that there will be the least public attention to his action,"" Peace Now said on its website. Read more: Evacuation of 150 West Bank settlers begins . Peace Now notes that the Ariel tender is a remarketing of prospective units not sold in previous bidding last December. ""This is another indication to the fact that the settlement of Ariel is not so attractive for Israelis, and that the government's efforts to expand it, comes mainly from political reasons, and not due to the housing needs,"" Peace Now said. Israel captured East Jerusalem and the West Bank during the Six Day War in 1967. Israel has annexed all of Jerusalem and considers the city its capital. It has occupied the West Bank and allowed Jewish settlements to take root there. But Palestinians supporting the two-state solution maintain the eastern part of Jerusalem should serve as the future capital of a Palestinian state and regard the West Bank as the future territory of an independent state.

"(CNN) -- Operators of the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan have started the dangerous task of removing fuel rods from a damaged reactor, the Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO) said Monday. The procedure is considered a milestone in the estimated $50 billion cleanup operation more than two years after a massive earthquake and tsunami brought disaster to the facility. When the tsunami swamped the plant, located 149 miles (240 kilometers) north of Tokyo on Japan's eastern seaboard in March 2011, it cut the power to vital cooling systems for the three reactors in use at the time. This resulted in the second-worst nuclear accident in history -- after Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union in 1986 -- as the reactors melted down and leaked radioactive material into the atmosphere. On Monday, TEPCO revealed ""preparatory work"" was underway, with a remote-controlled crane lowered inside Reactor 4. Some 1,500 spent fuel units will then be lifted from the cooling pool in specially-designed containers, or casks, and closed with a lid. Following decontamination, these casks will be taken down to ground level and transported to the common spent fuel pool on a trailer. The entire removal of all fuel inside the Unit 4 spent fuel pool is expected to take until the end of 2014, TEPCO says. 'Stopgap approach' The Fukushima cleanup has been beset by numerous problems, with TEPCO frequently criticized for its handling of the disaster. Earlier this year, Japan's Trade and Industry Minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, compared its ""stopgap approach"" to a game of ""Whack-a-mole."" The government has since stepped in and pledged $470 million to try to tackle the leaks, through measures, which by its own admission are unconventional and untested. TEPCO has been pumping huge volumes of water into the plant -- hundreds of tons daily -- to cool the crippled reactors that once powered the plant. But this water, which becomes highly radioactive once it comes into contact with the plant's fuel rods, has been stored in makeshift, hastily-built storage tanks around the site -- about 1,000 so far -- containing enough irradiated water to fill about 160 Olympic-sized swimming pools, with about 400 tons added to the tanks daily. Ongoing leaks . Scientists who monitor radiation levels offshore have pointed to evidence of an ongoing leak for more than a year, but it was only recently that TEPCO admitted it was occurring. Last month, TEPCO said one of the storage tanks at the site had leaked 300 tons of toxic water, prompting Japan's nuclear regulator to declare the situation a Level 3 serious incident, its most serious assessment since the 2011 meltdown. It has since stated that several tanks and pipes at the plant are suspected of leaking toxic water. Michael Friedlander, a nuclear engineer and former U.S. power plant operator, told CNN in September that the eventual failure of the tanks years after they were deployed on a supposedly temporary, emergency basis is illustrative of TEPCO's ad hoc, unsustainable response to the disaster. ""Given the cards they were dealt, building a tank farm to hold the water in the heat of the emergency, there was really there only one option, so I don't fault them for that,"" he said. But beyond the emergency response, TEPCO had demonstrated no long-term vision for dealing with the problem, he said. Fukushima's nuclear power mess: Five big questions .

"Havana (CNN) -- Cuban officials have accused the U.S. government of bizarre plots over the years, such as trying to kill Fidel Castro with exploding cigars. On Wednesday, they said Washington is using a new weapon against the island: spam. ""It's overloading the networks, which creates bad service and affects our customers,"" said Daniel Ramos Fernandez, chief of security operations at the Cuban government-run telecommunications company ETECSA. At a news conference Wednesday, Cuban officials said text messaging platforms run by the U.S. government threatened to overwhelm Cuba's creaky communications system and violated international conventions against junk messages. The spam, officials say, comes in the form of a barrage of unwanted text messages, some political in nature. Ramos said that during a 2009 concert in Havana performed by the Colombian pop star Juanes, a U.S. government program blanketed Cuban cell phone networks with around 300,000 text messages over about five hours. ""It was a platform created to attack Cuban networks,"" Ramos said. As first reported by The Associated Press last week, the U.S. Agency for International Development created a cell phone-based ""Cuban Twitter"" program, known as ZunZuneo. It allowed U.S. government officials to send blast texts to Cubans and allowed people on the island to message each other independent of Cuban government restrictions on communications. Under Cuban law, all Internet and communications services on the island are controlled by government-run entities. USAID officials envisioned the program being used to organize ""smart mobs"" that could challenge the Cuban government's control on power, according to documents obtained by the AP. U.S. defends 'discreet' program . Just this month, Cuba started a government e-mail service that allows people to receive e-mails on their phones. In the country, which has the lowest rate of Internet access in the Western Hemisphere, the vast majority of people communicate via text message rather than using e-mail. ZunZuneo -- Cuban slang for erratic, zigzag movements -- counted around 68,000 users at the height of the program's popularity, USAID said. The program ended in 2012 after U.S. government funds for it dried up. Cuban officials have blasted the program as part of a long-running campaign by Washington to destabilize the island's single-party communist government and said other similar mass-messaging programs still exist. U.S. government officials have defended the program, saying they were trying to foster free expression in Cuba. Last week, State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf denied accusations that the program aimed to push a particular political agenda. ""We believe that the Cuban people need platforms like this to use themselves to decide what their future will look like, and that's certainly what we did here,"" she told reporters. ""We were trying to expand the space for Cubans to express themselves. They could've expressed ... anti-American views on it. We didn't monitor or ... choose what they say on these platforms. That's up to them."" But other U.S. officials have been less positive about the program's value. During a USAID budget hearing Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, called ZunZuneo ""a cockamamie idea"" that the Cuban government had little difficulty tracing back to the United States. USAID administrator Rajiv Shah said that ZunZuneo had been carried out ""discreetly"" to avoid Cuban government detection, but it wasn't a covert program that would have required congressional approval. ""Creating platforms to improve communication in Cuba and in many parts of the world is a core part of what USAID has done for some time and continues to do,"" Shah said. ""Our administration's policy is to continue to support efforts to allow for open communications."" Shah said that USAID ""continues to support platforms"" like ZunZuneo, but he didn't go into details. Alan Gross' attorney: Program is 'shocking' Attempts by USAID employees and contractors to get U.S. government technology into the hands of Cubans has been at the heart of a high-profile case that's been a flashpoint in Cuba-U.S. relations in recent years. Former USAID subcontractor Alan Gross is serving a 15-year sentence in prison on the island after his 2009 arrest for importing banned communications as part of a USAID program to connect Cubans to the Internet. He was charged by a Cuban court in 2011 of being an American spy. USAID has said he was in the country working on a U.S. government project setting up satellite Internet connections. Shah said the U.S. government continues to push Cuban officials to release Gross. But Gross, 65, announced Tuesday that he had begun a hunger strike on April 3 from his cell at a Cuban military hospital to protest the way both countries' governments are treating him. His lawyer said he was shocked to learn about the ZunZuneo program. ""Once Alan was arrested, it is shocking that USAID would imperil his safety even further by running a covert operation in Cuba,"" attorney Scott Gilbert said in a statement. Gross has lost 10 pounds since beginning the hunger strike, a spokeswoman for his attorney said Tuesday. A statement issued Wednesday by Cuba's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed ""concern"" about news of Gross' hunger strike but said he ""was in good physical condition and his health was normal and stable."" Cuban government officials have offered to discuss trading Gross for three Cuban intelligence operatives serving lengthy prison in the United States. But U.S. officials have said that there will be no swap, saying Gross was not spying in Cuba. Former Cuban counterintelligence official weighs in . A former member of Cuba's secretive State Security unit, which hunts what Cuban officials perceive to be internal threats, said he wasn't surprised to hear about the U.S.-funded ZunZuneo program. It's just the sort of thing that Jose Manuel Collera Vento says he was tasked with stamping out when he worked as a counterintelligence official. ""My job was to discover and neutralize these plans against my country,"" said Collera, who's also a cardiologist and a top official in Cuba's Masonic community. Stretching back centuries, the Freemasons describe themselves as one the world's oldest and largest charitable and fraternal organizations. The organization has offices, or ""lodges,"" across Cuba and counts important Cuban historical figures like revolutionary Jose Marti among its members. In 2004, Collera says he came face to face with Gross. ""It's impossible that he didn't know he was carrying out clandestine and illegal activity,"" Collera said. Gross, Collera said, visited him to deliver camera equipment and money. At the time, USAID officials and representatives from other U.S. agencies proposed setting up satellite, Internet-based centers at the Masonic temples that Collera oversaw. ""Alan Gross as a person was nice, very friendly,"" Collera said. ""He communicated by making gestures because his Spanish was very limited."" What Gross did not realize, according to Collera, was that Collera was a 30-year veteran of Cuba's State Security and was informing his superiors of the USAID contractor's activities in Cuba. In 2007, a cable signed by the then-head of the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana described Collera as a likely Cuban government ""pawn,"" following ""instructions from the Castro regime to penetrate, weaken, and divide the Masonic community."" The message also said that only 100 members of Cuba's 25,000 Freemasons had Internet access and called the organization's Havana headquarters a ""neutral space"" where Cubans could ""participate in civil society."" U.S. diplomats in Havana, the cable concludes, ""and Miami-based donors have supported the Freemason movement in the past and should continue to do so."" The cable was among the trove of U.S. government documents obtained by WikiLeaks and published in 2010. It is unclear if Gross was ever warned that by meeting Collera, he had crossed paths with a possible Cuban counterintelligence operative and was now on authorities' radar. In 2009, Gross was arrested as he arrived at a Havana airport carrying satellite communications gear. According to a Cuban sentencing document from Gross' trial, he was traveling to the island to begin a project of connecting Masonic lodges to the Internet. The next time Collera saw Gross was in a Cuban courtroom. Collera testified against Gross at his 2011 trial and revealed himself as ""Agente Gerardo,"" a foot soldier in Cuba's vast State Security apparatus. Gross was convicted of threatening Cuba's national security and sentenced to 15 years in prison. His cover blown, Collera says Gross' arrest was his last case. But in an interview with CNN, Collera said Cuba's domestic intelligence capabilities make any United States-directed program, from the CIA's alleged exploding cigars to USAID's ""Cuban Twitter,"" nearly impossible to keep secret. ""There are 11 million Cubans,"" Collera said. ""That means there are 11 million people who could be State Security."" CNN's Kevin Liptak and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","Cuba accuses the United States of overloading communications networks .

"(CNN)  -- A third soldier who signed on to a 2007 newspaper column criticizing the war in Iraq has died. His peers are mourning their friend as an ""outstanding soldier"" with ""a thirst for knowledge and intellectual curiosity."" Spc. Jeremy Roebuck, 23, of Splendora, Texas, died from injuries after a January 28 automobile accident near Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The paratrooper was an assistant team leader with 1st Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, according to a news release issued by the military. A relative confirmed that he was one of the people to sign an August 19, 2007, opinion article in The New York Times that called the prospects of U.S. success in Iraq ""far-fetched"" and said the progress being reported was offset by failures elsewhere. Seven soldiers, members of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, based at Fort Bragg, signed the column. In September 2007, two of the other U.S. soldiers who signed the piece were killed in a truck accident outside Baghdad, Staff Sgt. Yance Gray and Sgt. Omar Mora. As for Roebuck, he reported to Fort Bragg in November 2004 and was initially assigned to 3rd Brigade Combat Team before being assigned to 1st Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment as an assistant team leader in November 2005. He deployed to Iraq in 2006, the military said. ""Spc. Roebuck was an outstanding soldier who was respected by both his peers and his superiors alike. He had proven himself in combat on the front lines in Iraq and had established himself as an upcoming leader in the unit. He was a good man and will be profoundly missed by the men of C Troop,"" said Capt. Jon Hartsock, commander of C Troop, 1st Squadron, 73rd Cavalry Regiment. Named as a sergeant in The Times article, Roebuck was listed at the lower rank of specialist when he died. A military spokesman would not elaborate on the circumstances involving his rank. The Times column said, ""Four years into our occupation, we have failed on every promise, while we have substituted Baath Party tyranny with a tyranny of Islamist, militia and criminal violence. ""When the primary preoccupation of average Iraqis is when and how they are likely to be killed, we can hardly feel smug as we hand out care packages,"" it said. Another of the soldiers who signed the article, Staff Sgt. Jeremy Murphy, was shot in the head a week before the article appeared, but survived. The military, in its news release on the death, said Roebuck's friends remember him as ""a rare and gifted soldier."" He received many awards and decorations. ""Spc. Roebuck is known throughout the troop for his consistent displays of courage and determination in 16 months of combat,"" Sgt. Buddhika Jayamaha said, ""but he is also known for his thirst for knowledge and intellectual curiosity."" Sgt. Buddhika Jayamaha is one of the seven names on The Times article.","Spc.

"(CNN) -- If Donald Sterling was trying to make amends with his public mea culpa, he didn't seem to make any friends. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, the embattled Los Angeles Clippers owner apologized profusely for his comments about African-Americans but insisted he is not a racist. That assertion was to be expected. But a plethora of other claims seem to contradict what others have said. CLAIM: ""Am I entitled to one mistake, am I, after 35 years?"" Sterling told Cooper he's not a racist, just someone who made a ""terrible, terrible mistake."" He was referring to the recorded conversation released last month, in which he told friend V. Stiviano that she should stop bringing black people to his games. ""In your lousy f***ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,"" he said, according to the audio posted by TMZ. In his interview with CNN, Sterling said his off-the-cuff remarks stemmed from jealousy, not racism. ""When she said to me, I'm going to bring four gorgeous black guys to the game ... I was a little jealous,"" he said. ""Am I entitled to one mistake? It's a terrible mistake, and I'll never do it again."" Sterling: I'm here to apologize and to ask for forgiveness . REALITY: Sterling has been accused of more than just one ""mistake."" Based on Sterling's track record with his real estate ventures, the business mogul has made more than one mistake based on discrimination, attorney Gloria Allred said. ""It wasn't one mistake. This is not an isolated incident,"" Allred told CNN's Bill Weir on Monday night. Allred is representing a woman who organized plaintiffs in a suit against Sterling. Sterling was sued by the Justice Department in 2006 on allegations that his rental company refused to lease apartments to African-Americans in Beverly Hills and refused to rent to non-Koreans in the Koreatown section of Los Angeles County. That case was settled in 2009. Sterling agreed to pay nearly $3 million but continuing denying the accusations. And in 2003, the nonprofit Housing Rights Center and a group of tenants who lived in Sterling's properties sued, accusing him of ""numerous discriminatory statements and housing practices,"" according to court documents. Sterling ""vehemently denied"" the allegations and accused the plaintiffs of ""being unreliable tenants and for being driven by hidden agendas,"" according to court documents. The case was dismissed in 2005 after a settlement was reached. Details of the deal were not disclosed. Sterling to Anderson Cooper: You're more of a racist than I am . ------ . CLAIM: ""I was baited. I mean, that's not the way I talk."" Sterling said he was actually echoing words that Stiviano had used before the recording. ""She would always use the word black, that's a black girl, that's a black guy, this is black that's black,"" Sterling said. He also said Stiviano's alleged comment about bringing ""four gorgeous black guys"" to a game came just before the publicized part of the recorded conversation. ""It was like she was baiting me just to say things,"" Sterling told Cooper. ""When I listen to that tape, I don't even know how I can say words like that."" REALITY: Stiviano blames his age. Stiviano, who is part black, said she doesn't think the 80-year-old Sterling is a racist. ""No, I don't believe that in my heart,"" she told ABC's Barbara Walters. ""I think the things he says are not what he feels. Anyone can say anything in the heat of the moment. ""I think he comes from a different generation ... he was brought up to believe these things ... segregation, whites and blacks,"" Stiviano added. ""But through his actions, he's shown that he's not a racist. He's shown to be a very generous and kind man."" Ex-NBA player: ""Baited"" comment is a joke . ------ . CLAIM: ""The players don't hate me. The sponsors don't hate me."" In fact, Sterling said, people have been calling him ""by the thousands"" to offer their support. REALITY: The players have protested, and sponsors have left in droves. At the first Clippers game after the Sterling controversy broke, players wore their red warm-up shirts inside-out and concealed the Clippers name. And sponsors such as Kia, CarMax, State Farm Insurance and Virgin America have pulled advertising from the Clippers after the recorded conversation was released. ------ . CLAIM: ""Because the media says that the (other NBA) owners want me out doesn't mean that they want me out."" Sterling told Cooper he doesn't just have a good team, he's a ""good owner."" REALITY: He didn't ask the owners if they want him out. Sterling said he has received the support of some other franchise owners. But he later said he didn't ask specifically about whether they wanted him to retain ownership of the Clippers. It's unclear whether the NBA can legally oust Sterling, CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos said. But Commissioner Adam Silver has placed the onus on the owners; they have the burden of deciding whether to oust one of their own. Yet even if the owners are privately sympathetic to Sterling, ""an owner who dares to defend the embattled Clippers owner commits social seppuku,"" Cevallos said. On the other hand, NBA owners are independent thinkers and independently wealthy, he said. If anyone can weather criticism, it's these captains of industry. ------ . CLAIM: Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson ""doesn't do anything"" for African-Americans. In perhaps the most bizarre part of his interview, Sterling lambasted the retired Los Angeles Lakers legend, who was mentioned several times in Sterling's recorded exchange with Stiviano. ""What kind of a guy goes to every city, has sex with every girl, then he catches HIV? Is that someone we want to respect and tell our kids about?"" Sterling asked. ""I think he should be ashamed of himself. I think he should go into the background. But what does he do for the black people? He doesn't do anything."" REALITY: Johnson has made plenty of impact off the court. Johnson has launched numerous business ventures not just to help the black community, but to invigorate the economies of impoverished areas. He founded Magic Johnson Enterprises and began investing in movie theaters, restaurants and fitness centers. The five-time NBA champion has focused on bringing high-quality businesses to diverse communities. He is also chairman and CEO of the Magic Johnson Foundation, which aims to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS through awareness and education. The foundation has also raised more than $20 million for charity and given almost $4 million in scholarships. What has Magic Johnson done? Quite a lot, actually .

"(CNN) -- Egypt has agreed to allow two Iranian warships to cross through the Suez Canal in a move that puts the country's new military regime in a prickly position with its Israeli neighbor. The post-Hosni Mubarak caretaker government gave the green light to the Iranian warships Friday, state media reported. They are expected to be the first Iranian warships to sail through the Suez since the Islamic republic's 1979 revolution. The canal is an internal body of water, and as such, Egypt has sovereignty over it. But Egypt also is bound by the 1978 Camp David Accords, which guarantee the right of free passage by ships belonging to Israel and all other nations on the basis of the Constantinople Convention of 1888. Before that, Egypt did not allow Israeli ships to sail through the canal. Last week, Egypt's newly empowered military government said it would honor all its international treaties. That would include Camp David. ""This is awkward -- at a minimum,"" said David Schenker, director of the Program on Arab Politics at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Schenker said the Iranians had asked for a frigate -- the Alvand -- and a military supply ship -- the Kharg -- to cross into the Mediterranean. Both are armed with missiles, he said, adding that their passage would create more uncertainty in the region. ""It's destabilizing. It raises tension, particularly in this time of transition in Egypt,"" Schenker said. ""This is typical of Syrian-Iranian opportunism."" Egypt's decision, analysts said, could show the direction that the military caretakers intend to take the Arab world's most populous nation. ""It does raise an unwelcome political issue that has to be resolved,"" said Cmdr. James Kraska of the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island. Iran said earlier that the flotilla was on a yearlong intelligence-gathering and training mission to prepare cadets to defend Iran's cargo ships and oil tankers from the threat of attack by Somali pirates, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. Asked about Iran's assertion that the ships are going to Syria for training, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday, ""My initial response to that would be we're highly skeptical of that."" Asked whether he was concerned about the ships' travel plans, he said, ""It's not really about the ships. It's what are the ships carrying, what's their destination, what's the cargo on board, where is it going, to whom, for what benefit. We have, you know, ongoing concerns."" Those concerns were shared by the White House, where Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One, ""We're monitoring that, obviously, but we also would say that Iran does not have a great track record for responsible behavior in the region, which is always a concern for us."" Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel's allies should pay close attention to the situation. ""We expect the international community to act speedily with determination against the Iranian provocations, designed to deteriorate the situation in the area, and put the Iranians in their place,"" he said. The Israeli Defense Ministry said it was monitoring the movement of the Iranian ships and alerted its allies. The Suez Canal is a key waterway for international trade. It connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go around Africa. Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day en route to Europe and North America.","Egypt agreed to allow two Iranian warships to cross through the Suez Canal .

"(CNN) -- Burned rubble near a Bali travel guidebook. Twisted metal beside brightly-colored suitcases. Headphones and human remains. In the rural area of eastern Ukraine where a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 fell from the sky on Thursday, the ground was scarred with death and devastation left behind by a flight that never reached its destination. Video footage from the site, located about 30 miles from the Russian border, showed smoke billowing from the smoldering wreckage long after the crash. ""It's a gruesome scene,"" freelance journalist Noah Sneider said. ""There's bodies splayed out through the fields. People said the plane kind of exploded in the air, and everything rained down in bits and pieces, the plane itself, the people inside."" Stunned rescue workers and rebel fighters combed the area, Sneider said, planting sticks with white cotton ribbons where they found bodies in the fields. There are so many dead that it's unlikely the local morgue will be able to hold them all, Sneider said, even in a volatile region that's seen waves of death recently amid clashes between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists. ""When there was the battle for the Donetsk airport, something like 50 people died and they didn't have the space,"" Sneider told CNN's Anderson Cooper. On this flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, officials say there were 298 people aboard. In the wide fields of tall grasses, debris stretched so far, in so many small pieces, that it seemed unfathomable that anyone would ever know for certain what happened to Flight 17, Sneider said. ""Finding things like passports,"" he said, ""is a matter of chance."" Separatists clearly controlled the site, Sneider said. But even battle-hardened rebel fighters appeared shocked, he said. Fighting has torn apart the region. But this is something else. ""Nothing of this scale has happened,"" said Sneider, who's been covering the conflict for months. Locals in the rural area trying to help were overwhelmed, he said. Firemen who rushed to put out the flames found they had a hose with holes in it, spraying water everywhere, he said. As night fell, search crews seemed uncertain about what to do at first, he said. But eventually, teams put up tents and set up flood lights in the field. Ukrainian officials said rescue and investigation teams had been hampered by armed groups in the area. Pictures suggested the area was hardly a cordoned off crime scene, with people standing on top of parts of the wrecked aircraft. And there are some reports that pieces of the aircraft have been looted and put in people's yards, CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Kiev. Sneider said he hadn't seen any looting by people in the area. ""Most of them are so frightened that they're not coming anywhere near here,"" he said.","A journalist at the crash site says charred debris fills a wide field with tall grass .

"Camp Pendleton, California (CNN) -- A U.S. military judge sentenced a Marine squad leader charged with alleged war crimes in Iraq to a maximum of 90 days in prison and a reduction in pay and rank. But because of a plea deal with prosecutors, Staff Sgt. Frank G. Wuterich won't serve any time in the brig. The military judge was obligated to abide by the plea arrangement between prosecutors and the defense. In the end, Wuterich's sentence amounts to a reduction in rank -- to private -- and a pay cut. A final adjudication will be made by Lt. Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, commander of Marine Corps Forces Central Command, but he cannot increase Tuesday's sentence, a Marine spokesman said. The commander can reduce it, though, the spokesman said. Meanwhile, Iraqi officials condemned the plea deal for Wuterich, who was facing several manslaughter and other charges. Also, a military law expert said the U.S. military needs to justify the ruling. The trial of Wuterich, who pleaded guilty to one count of negligent dereliction of duty, ends a six-year investigation into one of the Iraq war's worst attacks on civilians by U.S. troops. Twenty-four Iraqis died. In the sentencing, the military judge, Lt. Col. David Jones, cited how Wuterich ordered his troops to ""shoot first, ask questions later."" Wuterich, a divorced father of three young daughters, was the last of eight Marines charged. Charges were dropped against six of the other Marines charged in the case, and one was acquitted. One U.S. congressman compared the Haditha killings to the 1968 Vietnam massacre at My Lai. Wuterich, 31, of Meriden, Connecticut, originally faced 152 years in prison on nine counts of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and three counts of dereliction of duty in the November 19, 2005, killings -- charges he has vehemently denied. In exchange for his guilty plea, the most serious charges of manslaughter and assault charges were dropped. Facing the judge in a Marine base courtroom Tuesday, Wuterich, dressed in uniform, expressed no emotion. In the sentencing hearing, prosecutors asked for the maximum sentence. ""Today, Staff Sgt. Wuterich stands vindicated by the very same system that has held him captive for over six years,"" said Wuterich attorney Neal Puckett in a statement. ""We believe justice prevailed for Staff Sgt. Wuterich, and in turn, he wishes it was within his power to impart that same measure of justice to the families of the victims of Haditha,"" Puckett said in the statement. Earlier in the day, Wuterich told the judge that he was not a ""monster"" or ""cold-blooded baby killer."" ""For six years, I have had to accept that my name will always be associated with a massacre, being a cold-blooded baby killer, an 'out of control' monster, and a conspiring liar,"" Wuterich told the court. ""There's nothing I can do about whoever believes these things."" ""I never fired my weapon at any women or children that day"" in 2005, Wuterich said. ""When I told my team to shoot first and ask questions later, the intent wasn't that they would shoot civilians, it was that they would not hesitate in the face of the enemy,"" he said. Wuterich's case signals the end of a handful of alleged war crimes cases that came to light during the height of the war in Iraq. Wuterich pleaded guilty Monday to one count of negligent dereliction of duty, a charge that could have brought a brig confinement of up to three months, two-thirds forfeiture of pay for three months and reduction in rank to private, authorities said. ""Words cannot express my sorrow for the loss of your loved ones,"" Wuterich said to the families in his statement. Wuterich said he was ""absolutely devastated"" when his commanders were relieved of duty ""because of my words or actions."" He said he's been unable to advance his military career or pursue ""a secure life for my family outside of the military."" ""Many of the Marines who were there that day, along with everyone who has stood by me and supported me, may be disappointed that I pled guilty. It might suggest that I believe we behaved badly or dishonorably. The truth is, I don't believe anyone in my squad, nor any member of of Kilo Co, 3/1/ behaved in any way that was dishonorable or contrary to the highest ideals that we all live by as Marines,"" Wuterich said. ""Regardless of the outcome, I am here to take responsibility for my actions, and to accept the consequences,"" Wuterich said. Wuterich's plea came nearly two weeks into his court-martial at Camp Pendleton near San Diego. The killings enraged Iraqis, put a spotlight on the conduct of the U.S. military and saw a congressman compare it to Vietnam's My Lai massacre. The fallout from the incidents continued more than six years later, with reports that Iraqi-U.S. negotiations to extend a withdrawal deadline broke down over Iraq's refusal to grant American troops immunity from prosecution in Iraq. On Tuesday, Iraqi officials excoriated the plea deal in the court-martial. Khalid Salman, head of the Haditha local council, told CNN that ""we have been following this case since 2006 and we were hoping that those soldiers, who killed 24 innocent people, will receive fair punishment. ""But now we are convinced that the judicial system in America is unjust,"" Salman said. ""This is not the end, and we will continue pursuing those soldiers legally through the international courts."" Taleb al-Essawi, the political adviser to the governor of the Anbar province, told CNN that the local government is very disappointed with the court-martial decision. ""Big disappointment,"" al-Essawi said. ""I can't believe that the court decided to drop all the charges except one charge, which is negligent dereliction of duty. This is a joke because according to the Iraqi law, all those soldiers should be executed,"" al-Essawi said. ""We demand from the American administration to reconsider the court decision,"" al-Essawi told CNN. The U.S. government should compensate the families of the victims, he added. Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish lawmaker, said the Marines ""committed mass killings in Haditha"" and the plea arrangement was ""unjust."" ""We ask the human rights organizations and (nongovernmental organizations) in America and all over the world to strongly condemn this verdict. Iraqi blood isn't so cheap,"" Othman said in his Facebook posting. A U.S. military law expert said a public explanation was needed. ""The trial counsel and convening authority has a duty to explain this pretrial agreement in order to safeguard public confidence in the administration of justice,"" said Eugene R. Fidell, senior research scholar and a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School. ""The way our military justice system works,"" Fidell told CNN, ""is that the convening authority, a commander of the unit, makes the central decision. ""It's a command-centric system that we inherited from (King) George III. Pretrial agreements are contracts between the accused and the convening authority. ""The prosecution and staff judge advocate play an advisory role. At the end of the day, it's the commander's decision to accept or reject a proposed pretrial agreement,"" Fidell said. About the investigation into the Haditha massacre, Fidell said: ""It does seem that a set of cases that began with some pretty terrible allegations has basically fizzled. The public ought to have confidence in the administration of justice."" Fidell said he was concerned about the overall trend of justice emerging out of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. ""For some time, I've wondered whether the system was producing the kind of results it should have. What has struck me is that it has been difficult for the government to get convictions in a number of cases, and where it has gotten convictions, whether it has gotten significant penalties,"" Fidell said. In court Tuesday, Wuterich's attorney, Puckett, told the judge that ""Wuterich has been exonerated, his integrity is unfaltering."" ""He knows his Marine career has come to an end, but his only intention was to protect his troops,"" Puckett said. According to previous testimony and court records, Wuterich, who was assigned to 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, was the squad leader on November 19, 2005, when members of his patrol unit were moving a supply convoy moving through Haditha, an insurgent stronghold where armed resistance fighters hid along civilian populations. An improvised explosive device exploded under a vehicle, killing Lance Cpl. Miguel Terrazas, 20, and injuring two other Marines. During the more than two-week trial, prosecutors argued Wuterich lost control after seeing the body of his friend blown apart by the bomb and led his men on a angry rage ordering his squad to ""shoot first and ask questions later."" Wuterich's team stormed two nearby homes, blasting their way in with grenades and M-16 rifle fire. Among the dead was an elderly man in a wheelchair. When the 45-minute incident was over, 24 men, women and children were killed. Wuterich was accused of ordering his men to storm the homes, part of what his attorney has said was a search for those believed responsible for planting the bomb, and later shooting at the men. The prosecution contends the Marines were out for revenge. The case didn't come to light until January 2006 when Time magazine broke the story. Two months later, the military launched an investigation. The incident provoked the condemnation of Rep. John Murtha, D-Pennsylvania, who compared it to the 1968 massacre at My Lai, and President George W. Bush vowed then that if an investigation found Marines killed unarmed civilians, ""there will be a punishment."" The case has been delayed a number of times, most notably over a government subpoena for outtakes of a 2008 interview Wuterich gave to CBS' ""60 Minutes.""

"(CNN) -- A month before Spc. Ivan Lopez opened fire at Fort Hood's First Medical Brigade Building, he was under the care of military doctors, having been evaluated and treated for depression, anxiety and sleep disorders, according to military officials. Lopez reportedly purchased his .45 caliber Smith & Wesson handgun legally at Guns Galore, a gun store near Killeen, Texas, on March 1. He had no criminal history that would disqualify him from owning a gun in Texas. His background check was clear. Barely a month later, that same gun would be used to end the lives of three people and wound 16 others before being used by Lopez to kill himself. But should he have been allowed to have that gun in the first place? The answer isn't as simple as some gun control advocates would want, nor as black and white as many Second Amendment advocates would claim, especially for those in the military. Latest Fort Hood shooting revives broader gun debate . First, let me be clear: If Lopez had been determined to have been suffering from a severe enough form of mental illness to have posed a threat to himself or others -- or had a history of violence -- he should never have been allowed to remain in the Army in the first place, much less allowed to own a gun. There is, at best, conflicting evidence in this case whether that was true. But if he was only diagnosed with one of the more common, milder form of mental illness -- the same kinds of ailments that afflict millions of nonviolent Americans every day -- then there is little evidence to support that taking away his right to own a gun would be the prudent or legal thing to do, even for a soldier in the military. Psychiatric issues 'fundamental underlying causal factor' Mental illness, much like physical illness, covers a whole spectrum, from mild disorders like depression to severe issues such as paranoia and schizophrenia. The military already attempts to screen out new recruits who have anything more than a mild problem. There are screens as you come into the military -- some of which are based on self-reporting -- and there is screening when you return from a deployment or combat. For instance, everybody coming back from deployment has a post-deployment health assessment. Then, three to six months later, they get a post-deployment health re-assessment. If primary care personnel see any problems with a soldier and depression or anxiety, then he or she is referred to behavioral health experts for a deeper assessment. But there lies the tricky part. Because much of these issues rely on self-reporting, if a soldier, sailor, airman or Marine wants to stay in the military, by and large they'll just say ""everything is fine."" There are two kinds of soldiers: the one who is trying to stay in the military, who is not going to admit to anything that may lead to being kicked out, and the one who is trying to leave the military, who is more likely to come clean and get treatment for things like post-traumatic stress disorder. That's why their buddies play an important role. In the military, there is a strong sense of the need to watch out for your fellow soldier, but that also means taking care of fellow soldiers if they need treatment for difficulties. As we have seen the skyrocketing of suicides among active duty military personnel, I helped to develop a card called ACE -- ASK, CARE, ESCORT. If you are worried about a buddy, ask if they are OK, take care of them if they need help and then bring them to a base chaplain, mental health official or their commanding officer. But there is still much more to be done to prevent military suicides and tragic incidents like what we saw Wednesday at Fort Hood. PTSD: 9 questions, answered . We've seen the immediate ""stressers"" that have led to the dramatic increase in suicides in the military tend to be either problems in relationships -- spouses, friends, family -- or problems in the workplace. Often, they both can be happening at once; we call that a psychological toxin. For instance, say your girlfriend tells you she's pregnant by another man, or your boss or commanding officer is giving you a hard time on the job. If those happen separately, they can be difficult to manage, particularly for someone with severe mental illness. But when they happen at the same time -- particularly if there are delusions, paranoia and easy access to weapons -- it can be a deadly spark. So, we need to be extra vigilant when looking for those stressers, and help those in the military who need someone to talk to. But we also need to take a more complex approach. People tend to think there are easy answers: either strict gun control or throwing everybody who is mentally ill into the asylum. It's really a more nuanced conversation. It's about how you promote responsible gun ownership. It's about trigger locks and gun safes and other ways to at least slow down someone in a fit of rage, to make it harder for them to take their weapon into a barracks or Navy yard and start shooting. It's about how we provide for jobs and opportunities when people leave the service. A good job is a very good form of mental health intervention, as it often comes with good health benefits and a sense of structure and purpose. It's less about whether we should be afraid of a soldier with PTSD, and instead more about how, as a society, we care for our returning veterans. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

"(CNN) -- ""Still Alice,"" written by Lisa Genova, is a novel about a 50-year-old Harvard professor's struggle with Alzheimer's disease. It's also a book, Genova was told, that nobody would want to read. Lisa Genova, author of ""Still Alice,"" found success after self-publishing her novel. After spending 1½ years writing ""Still Alice,"" Genova spent just as much time trying to find a literary agent. ""I never heard a response from most of the query letters I sent,"" Genova said. ""Four literary agents asked to see the book. One of them said she just didn't think there was a general audience that would want to read about Alzheimer's."" When she was turned down by several traditional publishing houses, Genova decided to follow a different route: self-publishing via Web-based companies. When she informed one of the literary agents of her decision, his response was daunting. ""He said, 'Don't do that, you'll kill your writing career before it starts,' "" said Genova. But she decided to press forward. Turning to the Author Solutions self-publishing brand, iUniverse, Genova published her book for $450, a cost that included an ISBN -- the International Standard Book Number that uniquely identifies books -- and the ability to sell on Amazon.com. Months later, after receiving positive reviews on Amazon.com and a favorable review in the Boston Globe, Genova's book was picked up by Simon & Schuster and is in its 12th week on The New York Times Bestsellers List. ""If you believe in your book, I think you should give it a chance,"" Genova said. ""Still Alice"" ""was a book that people already identified with and [Simon & Schuster] saw the book's potential in a very real way."" Genova is not alone. As the economy takes its toll on traditional publishing houses -- HarperCollins dropped its Collins division in February, losing major executives and editors, and Random House continues with cutbacks -- more authors are looking to online self-publishing companies. Companies like Author Solutions or Lulu.com allow any budding author to submit a digital file of their manuscript on any subject matter. Unlike traditional publishing companies, these publishers only produce hard copies of the books when a customer buys one, a process known as print on demand. ""Anyone can publish, that's the beauty of it,"" said Gail Jordan, Director of Public Relations at Lulu. ""Nobody's going to say, 'We don't like your cover. Chapter 10 should be Chapter 6.' "" This means that the author retains the copyright to his or her book and is responsible for almost everything, from the costs for printing to, if they choose, marketing the book. Manufacturing prices with Lulu range from $4 to $19 per copy, depending on whether the book is a hardback or paperback and on the number of pages. Authors pay only when they buy a book. Lulu also offers publishing packages that include formatting, cover design, editing, marketing and more, beginning at $299. Since its inception in 2002, Lulu has digitally published more than 820,000 titles, Jordan said. About 5,000 new titles are added each week. ""With this economy, there are people who really need to make money and people with more time on their hands,"" Jordan said. ""We've been seeing a surge since November in people publishing."" Since 1997, Author Solutions has helped more than 70,000 authors publish more than 100,000 titles, according to Keith Ogorek, the company's vice president of marketing. Depending on the brand chosen, publishing with Author Solutions can cost an author anywhere from $399 to $12,999. Wordclay, another Author Solutions brand, offers basic do-it-yourself publishing free, although other Wordclay services, such as a custom cover or illustrations, are sold individually. Ogorek cited several pluses of print-on-demand publishing: the speed with which a book gets into the marketplace; the fact that readers, not critics, ""decide whether your book is any good or not,"" and the environmental benefit of fewer printed copies. ""With print on demand, there aren't that many dead trees,"" said Jordan. ""We hear that on our forums that people do like that."" Print on demand also allows for the ""opportunity for a greater return on your investment ... it just makes sense from an economic standpoint,"" said Ogorek, who believes many writers who've worked with Author Solutions have had success they would not have found at traditional publishers. Similarly, Melinda Roberts, author of ""Mommy Confidential: Adventures from the Wonderbelly of Motherhood,"" saw success after she published with Lulu. Roberts was turned down by three publishing companies that, she said, all told her the same thing. ""People were saying, 'This is fantastic, hilarious. I'm going to throw up if I read another memoir,' "" Roberts said. Publishing companies told Roberts that her book would not appeal to mainstream audiences. But Roberts believed her stories held value for many mothers. Though she says she has sold fewer than 300 books, mostly by word-of-mouth, the book has brought her new visibility. Roberts has appeared on various panels across the country to share her insight on being a mother and is scheduled to appear on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" to talk about a new ABC television show called ""In the Motherhood."" ""I'm happy about my success because I didn't really set out for it. It just kind of happened,"" said Roberts. As authors use print-on-demand publishing in growing numbers, they seem to be abandoning self-publishing through traditional ""vanity presses"" -- a method in which authors pay to get their books printed in bulk and then sell them on their own. ""Particularly in this economy,"" said Jordan, ""who wants to buy a certain amount of copies of their book? That really doesn't do anybody good."" ""On-demand publishing is certainly more flexible,"" said Kevin Gray, public relations manager at Author Solutions. ""So I think more people are turning to on-demand because it's a less of a commitment on the author's part."" Ogorek believes traditional publishers can benefit from the services provided by self-publishing companies. ""Traditional publishers are looking at us to find new and upcoming authors,"" he said. ""We provide that for them.""","Print-on-demand means digital copies only get printed when someone buys a book .

"(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned hostile remarks toward Israel and the denial of the Holocaust in Iran Thursday. Speaking at the Non-Aligned Summit in Tehran, the U.N. leader didn't mention the Iranian regime, but Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has made a string of incendiary remarks in recent years about Israel's existence and the Nazi Germany extermination of Jews last century. ""I strongly reject threats by any member state to destroy another or outrageous attempts to deny historical facts, such as the Holocaust,"" he said, speaking in Ahmadinejad's home turf. ""Claiming that another U.N. member state, Israel, does not have the right to exist, or describing it in racist terms, is not only utterly wrong but undermines the very principles we have all pledged to uphold."" Ahmadinejad has denied the Holocaust over the years and has been a strident opponent of Israel's existence. During a recent speech in Tehran, Ahmadinejad called for unity among all human beings to remove the Zionist ""black stain"" from the human society, Iranian media reported. ""I urge all (Non-Aligned Movement) members to work within the principles of the U.N. Charter to resolve disputes peacefully,"" Ban said. ""But it is not sufficient to focus on lowering tensions between (Non-Aligned Movement) countries, as important as that is. We must prevent conflict between all U.N. member states."" Ban had been discouraged by the United States from attending the meeting, seen as a propaganda stage for the Iranian regime. But the secretary-general says the United Nations has a ""close history"" and shared principles with Non-Aligned Movement, made up of nations that claim not to be aligned with any world power. ""Assuming the leadership of the NAM provides Iran with the opportunity to demonstrate that it can play a moderate and constructive role internationally. That includes responsible action on the nuclear program which is among the top concerns of the international community,"" Ban said. Iran's nuclear aspirations have been a top issue for the United States and other Western nations. The United States, along with other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, have engaged in discussions with Iran this year about its nuclear program. Western countries believe Tehran is intent on building nuclear weapons. Iran claims the program is only for civilian medical and energy purposes. ""For the sake of peace and security in this region and globally, I urge the government of Iran to take the necessary measures to build international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear program,"" Ban said. Earlier at the summit, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei defended his country's right to produce nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. ""The Islamic Republic of Iran considers the use of nuclear, chemical and similar weapons as a great and unforgivable sin,"" Khamenei said. ""This does not mean forgoing our right to peaceful use of nuclear power and production of nuclear fuel,"" he said. ""On the basis of international laws, peaceful use of nuclear energy is a right of every country."" While defending his nation's nuclear program, Khamenei took jabs at the United States. ""A bitter irony of our era is that the U.S. government, which possesses the largest and deadliest stockpiles of nuclear arms and other weapons of mass destruction and the only country guilty of its use, is today eager to carry the banner of opposition to nuclear proliferation,"" he said. Earlier this month, the U.S. Congress passed a package of sanctions aimed at Iran's nuclear program. Khamenei also criticized the U.N. Security Council, calling it a ""flagrant form of dictatorship"" that is not fair to some nations. ""The U.N. Security Council has an illogical, unjust and completely undemocratic structure and mechanism,"" he said. ""... It is through abusing this improper mechanism that America and its accomplices have managed to disguise their bullying as noble concepts and impose it on the world.""

"(CNN) -- The Ebola crisis caused by the deadly virus sweeping through West Africa has forced the International Olympic Committee to ban three athletes from the region competing at the Youth Games in Nanjing, China. The IOC says those from arriving in China from the affected areas will not be allowed to compete in combat sports or swimming, over concerns the virus could be transmitted during events. According to the World Health Organization, 1,069 people have died from Ebola with the majority of the deaths occurring in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. ""We regret that due to this issue some young athletes may have suffered twice, both from the anguish caused by the outbreak in their home countries and by not being able to compete in the Youth Olympic Games,"" read the IOC statement made in partnership with the Nanjing Youth Olympic Games Organizing Committee. ""The IOC and Organizing Committee will therefore offer to each of the National Olympic Committees affected, if they wish, that their national flag will be brought into the stadium at the opening ceremony and will be hoisted at the venues. ""The athletes who have not been able to participate will also receive in the near future an invitation from the IOC and the organizing committee to come to Nanjing to take part in a sporting competition and to experience the welcoming atmosphere and spirit of the city and Jiangsu province."" The IOC has also confirmed that other athletes from West Africa competing in events away from the swimming and combat sports will be subjected to regular physical examinations and temperature checks. The games, which take place between August 16-28 was first held in 2010 and will attract just under 700 athletes in this year's edition.","The Youth Olympic Games are taking place in Nanjing, China .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed a bill Friday that provides $600 million in emergency funding to help secure the U.S.-Mexico border. A day earlier, two senators -- Democrats Charles Schumer of New York and Ben Cardin of Maryland -- returned from their August recess to give the chamber's approval for the bill. The House of Representatives had already approved the measure. In the Senate, the bill passed by unanimous consent -- a parliamentary term for a voice vote that doesn't require the return of the entire Senate chamber. GOP leaders had agreed to the maneuver. Among other things, the bill provides for roughly 1,500 new law enforcement agents, new unmanned aerial vehicles, new forwarding operating bases and $14 million in new communications equipment. The measure has attracted strong Democratic and Republican support. Obama praised the plan after the Senate passed it, saying that congressional passage ""answers my call to bolster the essential work of federal law enforcement officials and improve their ability to partner with state, local and tribal law enforcement."" Obama argued that the new law would facilitate cooperation along the border between the U.S. and Mexican governments, and asserted that it would make ""an important difference"" in the push for comprehensive immigration reform. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters Friday that the measure would have a substantial impact in terms of reducing the ""trafficking of people, drugs, currency and weapons."" She also fired back at Republican critics of the White House's border control efforts, declaring that ""the administration had already devoted more resources to the southwest border than at any point in American history."" The bill is funded in part by imposing higher fees on personnel companies that bring foreign workers into the United States.","NEW: Napolitano says more is being devoted to the southwest border than ever before .

"Washington (CNN) -- New U.S. military intelligence suggests Iran plans to smuggle new shipments of weapons into Afghanistan in the coming weeks as part of an increased effort to interfere with coalition operations, a senior U.S. Defense Department official said Friday. The information came from an ""Iranian source"" whose tips on past shipments have been verified by the United States, the official said. The official declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information. He also declined to offer more details on the identity of the Iranian source. Intelligence gained by talking to people, sometimes referred to as ""human intelligence,"" is always considered sensitive for fear of compromising sources. ""There are indications the Iranians have stepped it up,"" the official said. But another U.S. official said Iran is only providing ""limited supplies of weapons to the Taliban ... not enough to cause major problems for coalition forces."" The official also noted that Iran -- a majority Shiite country -- and the Sunni Taliban almost went to war with one another in the late 90s, so it's not really in their interest to be a major source of top-shelf arms to the Taliban. Earlier this week, however, Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters in Afghanistan he was 'taken aback"" when he learned of a ""significant shipment"" of weapons from Iran into Kandahar in southeastern Afghanistan. Mullen and his aides declined to offer any other details. And the Defense Department official said the source has told the United States of ""volumes of Iranian munitions coming into Afghanistan."" Tehran has consistently denied supporting groups opposed to the Afghan government. U.S. and coalition troops have seen evidence of some Iranian weapons inside Afghanistan found in seized caches or in the aftermath of attacks. Some munitions have recent manufacturing dates and serial numbers. ""That leads us to believe there are ongoing and current shipments coming into Afghanistan from Iran,"" the official said. The Iranian weapons include not only rockets and grenades but also material and explosives to make improvised explosive devices. The official said the United States has found high explosives that are clearly manufactured in Iran with a particular process and design ""similar to what we saw with Iranian weapons in Iraq."" The Pentagon official said some of the upcoming shipments might be designated for Kandahar, adding that the U.S. military would do everything it could to stop that from happening. The official indicated it had been several months since coalition forces had seized any weapons shipments at Afghanistan's western border with Iran. Authorities believe shipments are broken up into smaller loads at the border and then brought into the country as unobtrusively as possible by truck convoys. The issue of just how much Iran is interfering inside Afghanistan remains under debate in the administration's national security circles. Recently, Defense Secretary Robert Gates accused Iran of playing a ""double game"" in Afghanistan, both aiding the Taliban and more publicly helping finance some public institutions. But he then described Iranian assistance to the Taliban as ""pretty low-level."" ""We have really not seen an increase of Iranian assistance, whether it's equipment or weapons or training, in western Afghanistan,"" Gates told reporters on February 22. ""We're obviously keeping an eye on it, but it seems pretty modest at this point.""","Info was from reliable ""Iranian source,"" the Defense Department official said .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An American held in Pakistan who said he was looking for Osama bin Laden is ""like a bulldog"" who wouldn't let go of the idea of finding the fugitive al Qaeda leader, his brother said Tuesday. ""My brother is not crazy. He is highly intelligent and loves his country and he has not forgotten what Osama has done to this country,"" Scott Faulkner, brother of Gary Brooks Faulkner, told CNN. ""Osama had made some references to our God, the God of the Bible, in a poor light, and the fact that he was taunting America and getting away with killing thousands of Americans, my brother took that very personally,"" he said. Gary Faulkner, 50, is being held in Pakistan after being stopped near the border with Afghanistan's Nuristan province, Pakistani police announced Tuesday. He was carrying a pistol, a sword, night-vision equipment and Christian religious books, said Mumtaz Ahmed, a police chief in the area. He told police that he had been looking for bin Laden since al Qaeda's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and had traveled to the area several times before, Ahmed said. A reward of up to $25 million is currently being offered by the U.S. State Department in return for information leading directly to bin Laden's arrest. Faulkner said he had no intention of killing bin Laden, but because of the weapons he was carrying, police did not believe him, Ahmed said. Faulkner is a California-born independent contractor who has lived in Colorado since 1968, his brother said. Colorado Bureau of Investigation records show that a Gary Brooks Faulkner has a lengthy criminal record of minor offenses that dates to the early 1980s. He served jail time on three separate occasions for various charges that included second-degree burglary, and was arrested as recently as 2006 for a traffic violation. More recently, Scott Faulkner said, his brother felt the U.S. government was not doing enough to bring bin Laden to justice, ""and he felt that he was, as a Christian, not afraid -- that he could boldly step out and that doors would be opened for him."" ""And I agree with him,"" Scott Faulkner said. ""The fact that he's been over there six times and has not received a scratch tells me that somebody's looking after him."" Scott Faulkner said his brother ""could blend in with the local population and go places that our military cannot go."" ""We have relationships with the Pakistani government: 'OK. You can go in this region or you can't go in that region,' whereas my brother could go about willy-nilly,"" he said. ""He had a long beard. He looked like Taliban. When he wore his robe, he looked like Taliban. The only way you could tell he was not was when he spoke."" U.S. Embassy Spokesman Richard Snelsire did not confirm that Faulkner was in Pakistani custody, but said the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar did receive notification that an American citizen was detained. Snelsire said they were trying to get more details. ""We're hoping to get consular access to the individual,"" Snelsire said. In Washington, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said the Pakistanis informed the U.S. government about the arrest, but he couldn't discuss details. ""We want to talk to him, figure out who he is, what brought him to Pakistan, and we'll take it from there,"" Crowley said. CNN's Reza Sayah, Samson Desta and Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.","NEW: Gary Faulkner jailed on three occasions in Colorado, records show .

"(CNN) -- Time waits for no man nor the players of the ATP and WTA tours as tennis' top men and women cross the border from Canada and head to Cincinnati, Ohio to compete in their second Masters tournament in consecutive weeks. This year will see a new champion crowned in the men's tournament with Rafael Nadal forced to sit out the defense of his title after injuring his wrist at the end of last month. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic will hope that he can succeed the Spaniard after finishing runner up four times at the Masters 1000 event in previous years. ""I care about winning this title a lot,"" Djokovic said, the ATPTour website reported. ""I lost four times in the finals. I haven't been really close in those finals either. I haven't been able to perform my best in this tournament when it was needed. ""But I did have a lot of good matches in Cincinnati. Hopefully I can go one step further this time, but I haven't been playing as well as I wanted in Toronto,"" said Djokovic, who was beaten by France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the third round last week. ""So these couple of days I've put a lot of hours in on the practice court to upgrade my game and get my level of performance where it needs to be in order to have a chance to go far in the tournament."" The Serb -- the top seed -- will have a testing opener against the winner of the match between Bernard Tomic of Canada and France's Gilles Simon who play Monday. The top eight seeds all have a first-round bye as lower-ranked players all vie for a second round spot. Germany's Benjamin Becker was an early straight-sets winner over Ivo Karlovic from Croatia. The German's 7-6 (7/5) 6-4 win sets up a second-round match with Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka. Becker's compatriot, Philipp Kohlschreiber is also safely through to the second round after a three-set win (6-3 4-6 6-4) over France's Jeremy Chardy. The world No. 24 is rewarded with a second round tie against sixth seed David Ferrer from Spain. His compatriot, Tommy Robredo was also a winner on Monday, beating American Jack Sock 7-6 (7/5) 6-3 to book a meeting with another U.S. player, Sam Querrey. After defeating Roger Federer to win the second Masters title of his career last Sunday, Tsonga (seeded 12th) starts his campaign on Tuesday against Russia's Mikhail Youzhny. Azarenka defends 2013 crown . In the women's draw, Sam Stosur will face Serena Williams in the second round for the second week running if the Australian can overcome Varvara Lepchenko of the U.S. on Monday evening. Williams brushed Stosur aside last week in Montreal before suffering a surprise defeat to her sister Venus in the semis. Venus gets her Cincinnati campaign underway with a first round match against Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic while her conqueror in Sunday's final, Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska has a bye and will play either Japan's Kurumi Nara or Swiss player Romina Oprandi. Reigning champion Victoria Azarenka of Belarus will face the Czech Republic's Barbora Zahlavova Strycova in her opening match on Tuesday. Maria Sharapova, winner at Cincinnati in 2011, will play Madison Keys in her opening match following the American's straight-set win (6-2 6-4) over France's Alize Cornet early on Monday. Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens was also a first-round winner, beating Slovenia's Polona Hercog 6-3 6-2 to set up a second-round match against French Open finalist Simona Halep of Romania. Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic will face Elina Svitolina in the second round after the Ukrainian's straight sets win over America's Lauren Davis.","Both ATP and WTA players back in action this week at Cincinnati Masters .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Tuesday that he will give up his salary until the nuclear crisis in the country is over. He also said he would review the country's energy policy and consider other energy sources like wind and solar power. Kan said he would give up his prime minister salary which is 1,636,000 yen a month ($20,200 a month), but he would still receive his lawmaker's salary. The prime minister's announcement comes the same day that about 100 residents, who had been evacuated from an area close to Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, were allowed to return home Tuesday for a short visit to gather belongings.  After donning protective suits to guard against radiation,the residents where allowed to go to their homes in the village of Kawauchi, officials said. They were only allowed one small bag and could stay in their homes for two hours. For some, this was the first time they had been home since April 22 when the Japanese government issued the mandatory evacuation from a 20-kilometer area around the nuclear plant. ""I left my medicine even though I have a chronic illness. I need to get it,"" a man told Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Also left behind were pets. Residents may be able to go back and get their pets in the near future, officials said. After two hours at their homes, residents were taken to a base to undergo examinations for radioactive substances. Cooling systems at Fukushima Daiichi, about 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, were knocked out by the devastating tsunami that struck Japan's Pacific coast after a massive earthquake March 11. The disaster triggered the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl as the cores of reactors 1-3 overheated and spewed huge amounts of radioactive contamination across the surrounding area. The disaster has led to mandatory evacuations of about 78,000 people living within 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of the plant. People living another 10 kilometers away -- or at least another 60,000 people -- have been ordered to remain sheltered. CNN's Junko Ogura and Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","Naoto Kan says he will give up his premier salary but not his lawmaker's salary .

"(CNN) -- Most people across Muslim and Arab lands viewed President Obama's speech in Cairo, Egypt, as ""excellent,"" a spokesman for the hard-line Palestinian movement Hamas said. Hamas spokesman Ahmed Yousef talked about President Obama's ""historical"" speech Friday on CNN. But the official, Ahmed Yousef, interviewed on CNN's ""American Morning"" from Gaza City, said there's a question on the street: Is the American president ""ready to walk the way he talks?"" ""This is the question,"" said Yousef, the senior adviser for former Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniya. In his address to Muslims, Obama called for bridging gaps between Israelis and Palestinians and urged the establishment of a two-state solution to the conflict. He called for an end to Israeli settlement building, and he called for the Palestinians to end violence against the Jewish state. And he cast a portrait of a grinding Palestinian existence. ""For more than 60 years, they have endured the pain of dislocation. Many wait in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza and neighboring lands for a life of peace and security that they have never been able to lead,"" Obama said Thursday. ""They endure the daily humiliations -- large and small -- that come with occupation. So let there be no doubt: The situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity and a state of their own."" But at the same time, Obama, while acknowledging that Hamas has some support among Palestinians, said the group has to realize that it has ""responsibilities."" ""To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist,"" Obama said. The leadership of Hamas, considered by the United States and Israel to be a terrorist organization, won elections in Palestinian territories in 2006, prompting stringent sanctions from the West. The speech comes months after an eruption of war in Hamas-controlled Gaza, when Israel launched a tough offensive against militants firing rockets at communities in southern Israel before the forging of a cease-fire that Hamas says is violated by Israel. Though Yousef called Thursday's speech ""historical"" and cited the president's ""wonderful words,"" he said Obama didn't call for lifting Western sanctions in Gaza and for helping the Palestinians. And, he said, more needs to be done to bridge gaps between the West and the Muslim world.  Watch Yousef talk about Obama's ""wonderful words"" » . ""They're still ignoring that the Palestinians are suffering from the sanctions, and this has become like a crime against humanity. It's collective punishment endorsed by the people in the West. I hope that we're going to hear something positive and see again action or facts on the ground after this speech,"" Yousef said. The two-state solution has been elusive for the state of Israel and the Palestinians. Yousef said the recognition of Israel should be considered until there is an independent Palestinian state. Israel wants recognition of its right to exist before it crafts a peace deal with the Palestinians. ""President Obama is a professor of international law; he understands that you can't ask the people who are under occupation to recognize their occupier. This is against the international law,"" he said. ""When we have our own state, a free and independent Palestinian state, then we can talk about this issue of recognition. ... It's too early to talk about recognition while we are suffering for the last 60 years from the occupation."" Hamas says a ""concrete path"" is required ""on the ground."" There have been promises under the Bush administration for the establishment of a Palestinian state, Yousef said. But the Palestinians ""lost confidence"" in the world community because of ""Israeli aggression justified by the Americans and the world community."" He now thinks the West needs to prove that it is ""really sincere"" about Palestinians concern and is ""ready to help the Palestinian to have their own independent state.""","Obama acknowledged Palestinians' ""daily humiliations,"" ""pain of dislocation""

"(CNN) -- Former Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova, who has been battling cancer, has died at the age of 45. ""FC Barcelona is in immense mourning,"" the Spanish club said in a statement. ""Tito Vilanova has died at the age of 45. May he rest in peace."" Vilanova, who had first been diagnosed with a cancerous tumor of the throat in November 2011, stepped down as Barcelona coach in July 2013. He succeeded Pep Guardiola, who is now Bayern Munich coach, in June 2012 and led the Catalan giants to the Spanish La Liga title during his time in charge of the team. Following the announcement of Vilanova's death, Barcelona said it would open an area of condolence in the main grandstand at its Nou Camp stadium. ""It will be open to anyone who wishes to express their sympathy and love for the late Tito Vilanova,"" the club added. ""The club wishes to express its most heartfelt sympathy to his family, who are being joined in these moments of mourning by FC Barcelona members and fans all around the world, as well as the rest of the footballing and sporting world."" Barcelona also revealed plans for a religious memorial ceremony in the coming days. The club's president Josep Maria Bartomeu said on this Twitter page: ""Tito Vilanova was a wonderful person, and will never be forgotten at FC Barcelona. Thank you for everything you taught us. Rest in peace."" Barcelona player Cesc Fabregas paid tribute on his Facebook page saying he met Vilanova 14 years ago, adding: ""Thank you for always trusting me, to help me improve and overcome personal and professional obstacles."" There have been also tributes from the global football community. Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos commented on Twitter that Vilanova was, ""An example of fighting and strength for all of us. RIP"" Vilanova's appointment after Guardiola's resignation came as something of a surprise to football experts. He was not well known outside Spain but was already a close member of the Barcelona family. He began his footballing career at the Catalan club, signing to the team's junior ranks as a 15-year-old. Unable to break into the Barcelona first team, he left to pursue a career as a midfielder with seven clubs in his native Spain before ending his playing days with Gramenet in 2001. A switch to management followed and Vilanova soon returned to the Nou Camp, eventually becoming Guardiola's assistant coach in 2008 before being named as his successor. In tandem, the pair won three La Liga titles and two European Champions League crowns. Vilanova's Barcelona team, which included star players such as Lionel Messi and Andres Iniesta, started the 2012/2013 campaign brilliantly. But just months into his reign, Vilanova took a temporary absence to undergo surgery followed by a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in New York. He returned in March 2013 to lead Barcelona to the league title which they won 15 points ahead of rivals Real Madrid. Club captain Carles Puyol stepped aside to allow Vilanova and former Barca defender Eric Abidal, who had been diagnosed with a liver tumor, to lift the trophy. A relapse of his condition in July last year saw Vilanova resign as Barcelona coach. He was replaced by Gerardo Martino. The true potential of Vilanova's tenure at Barcelona will now remain unknown.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Dale Robertson, whose horse expertise, Oklahoma roots and handsome looks helped him win cowboy roles in 1950s and '60s, has died at age 89, his wife said Thursday. Robertson was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer just last week while being treated for pneumonia at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California, Susan Robertson said. He died Tuesday. ""He always said he lived two or three lifetimes,"" she said. ""He was in Hollywood when it was great."" People we've lost in 2013: The lives they lived . Robertson's acting career began after a movie scout saw a photo of him in a Hollywood photo shop's display window. He had the portrait taken to send to his mother while he was stationed at an Army post in California, according to his official biography. He acted in several uncredited movie roles in 1948 after he left the Army, leading to his role as the outlaw Jesse James in ""Fighting Man of the Plains"" in 1949. Robertson starred in the TV Western series ""Tales of Wells Fargo"" from 1957 through 1962, riding a horse named Jubilee. During the last hours of his life, as he lay in a hospital bed, his wife comforted Robertson by whispering thoughts of what awaited him in the afterlife. ""I told him that Jubilee and Chief (his favorite dog) would be waiting to greet him,"" his wife told CNN. The role of a cowboy was not a stretch for Robertson, who grew up on an Oklahoma horse ranch. He and his wife raised horses in Oklahoma until moving to a San Diego suburb last summer, Susan Robertson said. Robertson never sought formal acting training, based on advice that he should keep his own personality, according to his biography. In the 1966 TV series ""Iron Horse,"" Robertson played a character who won a railway in a high-stakes poker game. He hosted, along with Ronald Reagan, episodes of ""Death Valley Days"" during the 1960s. Film roles, also mostly Westerns, included ""Devil's Canyon,"" ""Sitting Bull,"" and ""Dakota Incident."" In the 1980s, Robertson was a regular on the first season of ""Dynasty,"" and acted in episodes of ""The Love Boat,"" ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Dallas."" His last role came in two episodes of the TV series ""Harts of the West"" in 1993. The final 15 years of Robertson's life were spent in ill health, partly because of wounds suffered while serving in a tank crew in North Africa and Europe during World War II, his wife said. His wife called for an ambulance to take him to the hospital because of pain last week, she said. Doctors were treating him for pneumonia when tests revealed he had lung cancer that had spread to his brain, bones, liver and lymph nodes, she said.","Robertson's acting career began after a movie scout saw his photo .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams defeated Caroline Wozniacki for the second time in just over a week to move into the final of the Cincinnati Masters Saturday. The world No. 1 has dominated the Dane in recent times, losing only once in nine meetings, but didn't have it all her own way in Ohio. Like in last week's Rogers Cup quarterfinal matchup between the pair in Montreal, Williams had to bounce back from a set down before recovering to win 2-6 6-2 6-4. Both players struggled on their serves leading to an unusually high 15 service breaks throughout the match. The final set witnessed breaks of serve in each of the first five games before Williams pulled away to close out. ""I got off to a little bit of a slow start, but I was definitely in it,"" Williams said in quotes carried by the WTA website after the match. ""I was just physically grinding and trying to get in there and really just trying to grind out everything. ""(Wozniacki's) a really good returner and she was getting everything back, and making some good shots. It wasn't just on the return, she was able to play some really good points after the return too. ""She's playing great tennis, even better than what she's been playing in the last couple years, taking that defense and adding a lot of offense to it and going for her shots. She does both really well."" For her part, Wozniacki was frustrated to lose but encouraged by how far she pushed Williams given her less than stellar record in matchups between the pair. ""I didn't get many first serves in,"" Wozniacki said. ""When I did, they weren't placed very well. ""It's frustrating, because you lose a match 6-4 in the third and you only hold serve once. I actually broke Serena three times in the set, too. I don't think that really happens very often to her, either. ""I felt like my game was there. I was fighting. I was running. I was trying to take the ball early. I was returning well. Then my serve comes around and I can't seem to hold serve. It's frustrating."" Despite winning 17 grand slams and 61 singles titles in all during a glittering career, Williams has never been able to win the prestigious Cincinnati tournament. She came close last year but lost out after a nail-biting third set tie-breaker to Victoria Azarenka. Williams will now meet the winner of Saturday's second semifinal between fifth-seed Maria Sharapova and ninth-seed Ana Ivanovic. Ferrer marches on . In the first men's semifinal Saturday, David Ferrer comfortably overcame Julian Benetteua in straight sets 6-3 6-2.

"(CNN) -- The last polar bear in Africa died Wednesday after months of grieving his longtime companion at a zoo in Johannesburg, a far cry from his Arctic habitat. Wang, 28, suffered from chronic arthritis and liver failure. The Johannesburg Zoo, where he had been a major attraction since he was a cub, put him down for health reasons. The chief veterinarian ""had to make a very tough decision,"" the zoo said in a statement after his death. The furry giant spent his last days pining for GeeBee, his polar bear partner of 28 years, who died of a heart attack in January. GeeBee and Wang had spent their days together at the zoo since they were 6 months old. It was a notable friendship -- polar bears tend to be solitary animals. After her death, Wang walked around listless and shunned food and swimming, the latter a favorite pastime with GeeBee. To distract him from his heartbreak so he could eat and improve his health, the zoo coaxed him with special treats and showered him with toys. For Valentine's Day this year, zoo officials brought Wang a box filled with fruit and meat, and decorated it with love hearts and a note that said, ""We Love You Wang!"" Companies also showered him with toys and gifts, including an offer of a snow machine in the hopes that it might excite the animal long associated with subzero temperatures. But Wang had lived his entire life in a warm climate, and a sudden change in environment would be fatal for his advanced age, the zoo said at the time. In the wild, polar bears barely make it past 20 years, said Agnes Maluleke, the carnivore curator for the Johannesburg Zoo. Wang was born at a Japanese zoo, and GeeBee came from Canada after both were swapped for lions. The two met at the Johannesburg Zoo in 1986. They did not breed because polar bears' reproduction is stimulated by cold weather, Maluleke said. The zoo has no plans to replace the polar bears.","Wang suffered from chronic arthritis and liver failure .

"(CNN) -- There in the baby section, behind boxes of strollers, was a 14-year-old boy with a secret. The runaway had made the 24-hour Walmart in Corsicana, Texas, his getaway hideout. For what may have been more than two days in July, he roamed the store unnoticed. When he was tired, he'd lie down in his hidden cubby and sleep while shoppers were unaware the runaway was back there. Police had been looking for the boy, who was visiting his aunt in the town about an hour's drive south of Dallas, for 54 hours when they got a call from a Walmart. An employee had spotted the lad on the lam coming out of his hiding place. Walmart spokesman Brian Nick told CNN the chain cannot verify how long the boy was in the store but said this is definitely an isolated incident. ""It seems to be a unique situation, for sure,"" he said. Nick said Walmart hasn't asked for police to press charges. ""Our concern was getting the child to safety,"" he added. CNN affiliate KTVT obtained pictures of the child's hideaways, one showing a makeshift bed between stacks of boxes. The station reported the youth appeared to have changed clothes several times, stashed away supplies and had even taken a fish from the pet department. Police said the boy's mother told them he had run away several times before. In those cases, he had fled to abandoned houses, other businesses or creeks.

"Paris (CNN) -- France's interior minister admitted Monday that lapses in security made it possible for Greenpeace activists to gain entry to a nuclear power plant southeast of Paris. Interior Minister M. Claude Gueant said there have been lapses in the nuclear plant's security system and has ordered a search of all nuclear plants, a spokesman for the ministry told CNN. The environmental activist group said on its website that members gained entry to the plant at Nogent-sur-Seine at dawn and managed to climb the dome of one of its two reactors ""in order to spread the message: 'Safe nuclear does not exist.'"" ""This action shows how vulnerable the French nuclear centrals are: Peaceful activists have managed with a few means, to reach the heart of the nuclear central! Why? How? Because the security device is insufficient,"" the website stated. President Nicolas Sarkozy, during a news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, called the act ""irresponsible,"" but said that the government will ""absolutely publish all"" of the audits related to plant security.","Interior minister has ordered a search of all nuclear plants, spokesman says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Shelly Sterling asked a Los Angeles probate court Wednesday to uphold her negotiated sale of the team for $2 billion despite her husband's objections, her attorney said. The probate court agreed to hold a four-day trial on the issue, beginning July 7. Sterling's legal maneuver comes as three physicians say her estranged husband, Donald, 80, is mentally incapacitated, said her attorney, Pierce O'Donnell. Court papers say her husband shows early Alzheimer's or other brain disease. Donald Sterling, the team's other co-owner, doesn't want to sell the team as the National Basketball Association demands; this week he called the league ""despicable monsters"" and ""a band of hypocrites and bullies."" O'Donnell said his client sought an expedited hearing ""given the fact this is a very important transaction,"" he said. ""It's unfortunate. Mrs. Sterling regrets having to go to court and publicly air this problem. But Mr. Sterling's conduct in reneging on the sale requires her to do so,"" O'Donnell said. Joining Sterling and O'Donnell at the courthouse Wednesday was the attorney for former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, with whom Shelly Sterling has reached an agreement to sell the franchise for a record $2 billion. Donald Sterling opposes a sale of the team and says he gave his wife a purported letter only to negotiate with a buyer, not to formally sell the team, his attorney said Wednesday. ""Bottom line, Donald Sterling does not want to sell the team,"" attorney Bobby Samini said. Technically, a family trust owns the Clippers. But O'Donnell said that three physicians have certified that Donald Sterling lacks the mental capacity to function as a trustee of the complex trust. ""The trust agreement provides that if two qualified physicians certify that he's mentally incapacitated, he's removed. We also have a third distinguished doctor who's an expert in this field, mental capacity, who has reviewed the evidence, and supports the other doctors and agrees on that conclusion. So there's three doctors. We only need two,"" O'Donnell said. ""This is a complex business. You have a $2 billion basketball team. You have massive amount of 150 real estate holdings, and it requires a person to run the business who is competent, and the doctor -- three doctors -- have said that he lacks the mental capacity,"" O'Donnell said. Doctors' findings . Donald Sterling recently underwent a CT scan and a PET scan of his brain, according to Shelly Sterling's court filings. Dr. Meril S. Platzer, a California neurologist, examined Donald Sterling on May 19 and found he ""is suffering from cognitive impairment secondary to primary dementia Alzheimer's disease,"" court papers said. The PET scan on May 16 providing findings ""consistent with a neurodementia of the Alzheimer's type,"" Platzer said in his certification of Donald Sterling's incapacity. Donald Sterling was unable to spell ""world"" backward, was unaware of the season of the year and initially had difficulty drawing a clock, Platzer said in court papers. Dr. James Edward Spar, a specialist in geriatric psychiatry who examined Donald Sterling on May 22, said Sterling suffers ""mild global cognitive impairment"" and ""the overall picture is consistent with early Alzheimer's disease, but could reflect other forms of brain disease,"" court papers said. Platzer said in a May 29 certification that Donald Sterling has ""an impairment of his level of attention, information processing, short term memory impairment and ability to modulate mood, emotional liability, and is at risk of making potentially serious errors of judgment,"" court papers said. Spar said in May 27 letter that Donald Sterling ""is substantially unable to manage his finances and resist fraud and undue influence, and is no longer competent to act as trustee of his trust,"" court documents said. Another specialist in geriatric psychiatry, Dr. Stephen L. Read, ""confirmed the methodology and conclusions of Drs. Platzer and Spar,"" court papers said. ""I agree that the history and the findings are highly suspect as representing the slow emergence of progressive dementia, and specifically Alzheimer's disease,"" Read said in documents filed in court. ""In addition, the findings described are fully consistent with the general loss of brain tissue and, more specifically, with the pattern of impaired brain functions demonstrated by the PET scan of May 16, 2014."" Under the trust agreement, if Donald Sterling became mentally incapacitated, he would be removed as a trustee, O'Donnell said. Donald Sterling is mentally sound, one of his lawyers, Maxwell Blecher, told CNN on Tuesday. ""It strikes me as totally incredible to argue that this man -- I talk to him every day -- is incapable of making decisions and is mentally incompetent,"" Blecher said on Tuesday afternoon. ""And I don't believe any court is going to make a finding to the contrary."" Adam Streisand, the attorney for Ballmer, said his client was hoping for a speedy court date. ""Mr. Ballmer has insisted, as a provision of this deal, Shelly Sterling get approval from the court that she has the authority as the sole trustee based upon the removal of Mr. Sterling as a trustee. So we are here because Mr. Ballmer is insisting that the court bless the transaction,"" Streisand said. ""If it does not go forward, the consequences are dire,"" Streisand said. ""Mr. Ballmer is not going to stick around for years, for this to wind through the courts. And the NBA has made it very clear that it will take over the team, and that is a consequence that is not going to benefit the Sterling family."" September deadline . Donald Sterling initially vowed to fight the sale and filed a lawsuit against the NBA, then said he was going along with the sale -- until Monday, when he again pulled his support. ""From the onset, I did not want to sell the Los Angeles Clippers. I have worked for 33 years to build the team,"" Donald Sterling said. In Shelly Sterling's court filings, NBA general counsel Richard W. Buchanan said if the Sterlings don't sell the team by September 15, the league may sell the team or renew termination proceedings against the Clippers or both. In one document, Shelly Sterling said her husband ""has gone back and forth between opposing the sale and supporting the sale"" of the team since May 29. ""To date, I have not received Donald's written consent to the sale of the Clippers to (Ballmer) for $2 billion,"" Shelly Sterling said in court papers. Sterling has been embroiled in controversy since a recording of a conversation with his friend V. Stiviano surfaced. The recording included a series of racist comments. Sterling's comments, first posted on TMZ, sparked outrage among NBA players, executives and fans. The commissioner fined Sterling $2.5 million and banned him for life from the NBA. In a statement Tuesday, Sterling said he has apologized for the remarks and his apology is sincere. He also made inflammatory comments to CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" about African-Americans, which the NBA had planned to use as part of its evidence against him in an owners' meeting where a vote would be taken on whether to terminate his ownership rights. The meeting was canceled. Sterling's lawsuit makes clear that he believes the NBA has no right to force such a sale, and the league was wrong in banning him for life and fining him. In addition to damages, the lawsuit seeks a restraining order.

"(CNN) -- If watching Katherine Heigl's romantic comedies made you want to swear off movies, you've got company: the actress herself. The former ""Grey's Anatomy"" star, who went from ""27 Dresses"" to ""The Ugly Truth"" to ""Life as We Know It"" to ""New Year's Eve,"" admits she indulged a little too heavily in the frothy films -- enough to make her consider quitting acting. ""I had an amazing time. I love romantic comedies,"" the actress, 35, told Marie Claire UK in its August issue. ""But maybe I hit it a little too hard. I couldn't say no. I stopped challenging myself."" It got so bad, Heigl said, that she took time on a Utah ranch to contemplate a different career.

"Washington (CNN) -- Bill Cosby sits in the shade of his own shadow, a large mural painted in his likeness on the wall outside Ben's Chili Bowl in Washington D.C. Cosby's still got a sharp mind and a sharper sense of humor, but he's starting to show his age: It's hot outside, and despite the sticky August weather, Cosby is wearing white socks with his brown leather sandals. The 76-year-old comedy legend has been visiting the D.C. eating establishment since 1958 and is perhaps its most famous patron -- so when the restaurant decided to celebrate its 50th anniversary, it was fitting that Cosby hosted the festivities. Today the restaurant turns 55, so it's no surprise he's back. Before Cosby takes the stage, though, local politicos step into the spotlight and celebrate in the way politicos do -- promising resolutions and issuing declarations and proclamations. A highlight was a letter read aloud from President and Mrs. Obama, who promise to return for a spicy meal soon. But before Ben's Chili Bowl received the keys to the city, before the president took his first bite of a chili dog, and before Cosby put Ben and his family on the map, Ben's Chili Bowl was a humble food joint founded by an immigrant from Trinidad and his young wife. Trading mops for menus . Ben Ali had moved to America for college and according to his wife, Virginia, had worked his way through school climbing the restaurant ladder -- eventually trading mops for menus as he transitioned from cleaner to maitre d'. After several years in the business, he decided to try his hand at owning a restaurant instead of just working in one. He and his wife settled on the U Street location, taking over an old pool hall and transforming it into what it is today -- the landmark Chili Bowl. ""If you were going to open a restaurant in Washington and you were African American in those days, there was one place to really go, and that was this very vibrant community right here,"" on U Street, says 79-year-old Virginia, sitting in the back room of the restaurant beneath a painting of her late husband. In the late 50s and 60s, U Street was fondly known as ""Black Broadway"" due to the jazz clubs, theatres and African-American owned business found on the street. MLK and Duke Ellington . According to the restaurant's website, ""it was not uncommon to see such luminaries as Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Cab Calloway, Nat King Cole, Redd Foxx, Dick Gregory, [or] Martin Luther King Jr."" at the restaurant. ""We've always treated all people the same so it doesn't matter if you are the president or MLK or if you are just the guy from the corner,"" says Virginia. ""We like the diversity that we have here. We just kind of try to provide a family atmosphere because we believe so much in family."" Cosby, too, frequented during his time in the Navy and even brought his now-wife Camille on dates. According to Virginia, Cosby was always a gentleman and was always funny. ""He wasn't famous, but he was always funny. He was just great fun to be around,"" says Virginia. ""He's been coming since '59 and he's been the most ardent and faithful supporter all these years. As he grew, he kind of took the chili bowl along with him."" According to Virginia, when Cosby's show was rated No. 1 for five years, NBC asked him to do a press conference in Washington. After agreeing, he was asked where he'd like to do it. ""Bill could have done it at the White House, but he said at Ben's,"" said Virginia. ""And it wasn't a great neighborhood then ... because after the riots of 1968 many middle class African Americans moved away, businesses that were looted and burned and never reopened."" The turbulent '60s . Following the assassination of King, riots caused many businesses to close due to curfew restrictions placed in D.C. Ben's Chili Bowl should have been one of them, but civil rights activist Stokley Carmichael wouldn't hear of it -- he convinced local authorities to keep Ben's open past the street's evening curfew, one of the only establishments in the area to be able to do so. Despite the curfew, though, the restaurant still faced threats in the streets and the owners worried about the safety of their workers. ""We took some crayon and wrote on the window 'Soul Brother' to identify the business as an African American business,"" explains Virginia, who adds that the restaurant was fortunately spared from destruction. Following that turbulent period, the African American middle class moved to the suburbs, causing the neighborhood to deteriorate and ultimately inviting the drug dealers to the street corners. Virginia explains that it was a difficult time, but the restaurant's troubles didn't end there. In the 80s, the construction of the Metro's Green Line closed every store on the street. Ben's stayed open, though, fighting through the boarded up buildings and thin customer base. They survived by employing one person at that time and eventually catering to the construction workers. Mean something to the city . On the restaurant's 40th anniversary, Virginia and her husband were in Trinidad when their son called them and told them they were going to host a small celebration. He later called them back, urging them to return to the United States because the party was going to be ""a little bigger"" than he had planned. When Virginia and her husband arrived, they were blown away by the sheer amount of television crews and people who had shown up in support. ""What was really profound for me was that people came from this city, from this community, and stood in line for hours just to come in and buy a hotdog,"" says Virginia. ""I just felt, wow, this is Washington, this is our community. Maybe we really mean something to this neighborhood. Maybe we really mean something to the folks of this city.""","Comedy legend has been frequenting Ben's since the late 1950s .

"Washington (CNN) -- It always comes back to the budget. With Congress facing a crucial debate on attacking Syria over chemical weapons use, conservatives are signaling their price for support may be increased funding for a shrinking military budget. Two hawkish Republicans -- Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina -- went to the White House on Monday to argue their call for a robust military campaign against Syria intended to significantly weaken the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Implicit with such a campaign would be the needed restoration of military funding cut by austerity measures and transformation policies in recent years, including the forced spending cuts known as sequestration imposed by Congress for the current fiscal year. ""We cannot keep asking the military to perform mission after mission with a sequestration and military cuts hanging over their heads,"" GOP Rep. Buck McKeon of California, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN on Monday. ""We have to take care of our own people first."" While McKeon made clear that his concern is about future preparedness rather than current capability, he argued a bedrock conservative stance against having the military be a major contributor to cost-cutting in Washington. ""I have no concerns of their capability. They're the strongest, best equipped, best trained military,"" he said. ""What I'm looking at is what they've been hit with the last couple years. Where will they be the next time they're asked?"" Noting that ""the world has not gotten safer,"" McKeon complained that ""we're cutting back $1 trillion out of our military, asking them to do more with less."" Obama looks to Congress to bolster legal case for Syria strike . McKeon: stop asking the military to do more with less . ""That has to stop,"" he said, calling for President Barack Obama to ""fix"" the across-the-board spending cuts on the military and other discretionary government spending that doesn't include entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. After meeting with Obama, both McCain and Graham said they were encouraged by the president's intended approach, which includes more military aid for Syria's opposition while degrading the capabilities of al-Assad's forces. However, they said they need more detailed assurances that the U.S. strategy would be sufficiently strong and sustainable before they could recommend it to their colleagues, who will vote in coming weeks on whether to authorize military action. ""There seems to be emerging from this administration a pretty solid plan to upgrade the opposition"" in Syria and to ""get regional players more involved"" in shifting the balance of the Syrian civil war against the al-Assad regime, Graham said. Both McCain and Graham said congressional rejection of a resolution authorizing U.S. military force in Syria would be catastrophic and undermine the credibility of the nation and the president. Syria vote could have consequences for 2016 . Syria issue exacerbates budge wars . The Syria issue exacerbates an already hostile budget environment between the two parties. With fiscal year 2013 ending in four weeks, Congress has yet to pass a 2014 budget and is expected to consider a short-term measure to extend spending at current levels for weeks or months to allow time for further negotiations. A major issue of the budget debate is whether to recalibrate spending to soften or eliminate the impact of the forced cuts of sequestration. While both sides say that is the right move, they remain unable to agree on how to make it happen. Obama and Democrats want to maintain or increase spending on education, technology and infrastructure, while Republicans seek to shrink overall government spending. The two sides also differ on tax reform, another key component of spending policy. In addition, the government says it needs an increase in its borrowing limit -- the debt ceiling -- sometime next month. Some Republicans advocate a government shutdown unless Democrats capitulate on spending cuts, especially to a call by tea party conservatives such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas to eliminate from next year's budget the funds needed to implement the 2010 health care reform law. Opinion: Obama on war -- a realist and risk taker . Congress to debate Syria resolution . Congress will not vote on Obama's request to authorize the use of force against Syria until sometime after it officially returns from recess September 9. To launch the debate on Capitol Hill, Senate and House committees will hold hearings this week. Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey will appear at the first hearing by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, sources said. In addition, Obama will meet Tuesday with House Speaker John Boehner and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, as well as leaders of national security committees in Congress. Conservatives have increased references to overall military spending in recent days when commenting on the Syria situation. ""I have watched what's happened in the last 4 1/2 years with the president downgrading our military,"" Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told CNN on Friday. ""And it's to the point where we're in a position right now where we don't have the assets to get involved in another intervention."" He warned that firing cruise missiles at Syria would inevitably lead to greater involvement and that administration officials must ""make sure that you tell us how you're going to pay for it, what resources you're going to use, what assets you're going to use and that they're there."" GOP Rep. Mike Pompeo of Kansas, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, argued Monday for a bigger mission than the limited strikes Obama has said he has been considering. ""It does us no good to just lob a few missiles into Syria,"" Pompeo said. ""This is in the context of an Iranian-backed enterprise with Bashar al-Assad, with Hezbollah. You have al Qaeda now having the ability to move on the ground and perhaps get chemical weapons. America has interests that are much more broad than some short strike could possibly accomplish and so we need a strategic vision with real definable and achievable goals."" Military has concerns about Syria mission . The administration's ""flood the zone"" strategy . Obama and his team also emphasize the national security angle when arguing for a military response to what they call a major chemical weapons attack by al-Assad's regime on August 21 on Damascus suburbs. The president, along with Vice President Joe Biden and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, was making phone calls to House and Senate members to try to firm up commitments ahead of the congressional vote. A conference call with House Democrats also was planned as part of what a senior administration official called a strategy to ""flood the zone."" In the calls, the official said, the White House will be making the same case it did during a classified Capitol Hill briefing Sunday. The argument is that failure to take action against Syria would undermine the deterrent of international action against chemical weapons use, emboldening al-Assad and his key allies -- Hezbollah and Iran -- who will see a lack of consequences for such a flagrant violation. On the administration side, there is no mention -- yet -- of the military budget. Could Syria strike back if United States, allies, attack?","NEW: Senate and House committee hearings on Syria begin this week .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- One of the men who toppled an ancient boulder in Utah's Goblin Valley State Park last week filed a personal injury lawsuit just a few weeks earlier, claiming he suffers from ""serious, permanent and debilitating injuries."" Video of Glenn Taylor shoving the huge rock off a slender pedestal where it rested for millions of years went viral online and prompted media scrutiny. As his friend sang ""Wiggle it, just a little bit,"" Taylor pushed the delicate sculpture over, which was followed by laughter and high fives with his son. The attention has led to revelations that Taylor filed a personal injury lawsuit in September, claiming he had suffered ""serious, permanent and debilitating injuries"" from a 4-year-old car crash. ""Someone with a bad back who's disabled, who can't enjoy life, to me, doesn't step up and push a rock that big off the base,"" the defendant in Taylor's lawsuit, Alan MacDonald, told Salt Lake City television station KTVX. 'You didn't see how hard I pushed' Taylor's lawyer did not return calls for comment. But when CNN affiliate KUTV noted that Taylor didn't look particularly debilitated in the video, he replied, ""You didn't see how hard I pushed."" CNN legal analyst Danny Cevallos said when someone has a pending disability lawsuit, ""you'd think they'd avoid the camera like the plague. ""But instead, they think no one will ever see it or repercussions will ever come of it,"" Cevallos said. 'Glenn saved his life' Goblin Valley, in southern Utah, is home to thousands of the mushroom-shaped rocks -- known to locals as goblins -- that developed as millions of years of winds and water eroded sandstone cliffs. Taylor and two other men were leading a Boy Scout group on a visit to the park when the incident happened. The men, all from Utah, defended their actions in interviews last week, saying the delicate structure posed a threat to visitors. ""We have now modified Goblin Valley, a new Goblin Valley exists,"" David Hall, who shot the video, is heard saying at the end of it. ""That's crazy that it was held up just by that little bit of dirt. Some little kid was about ready to walk down here and die and Glenn saved his life by getting the boulder out of the way. So it's all about saving lives here at Goblin Valley. Saving lives. That's what we're all about."" Hall told Utah television station KUTV that the boulder seemed unstable. ""That wasn't going to last very long at all,"" he told the CNN affiliate. ""One gust of wind and a family's dead."" Asked if he would do it again, he said, ""Absolutely, absolutely."" 'Didn't look like a stiff wind to me' Park officials suggested the men broke the law by defacing a state park. Jeff Rasmussen, the deputy director of Utah State Parks and Recreation, said, ""It didn't look like a stiff wind to me."" ""Obviously, we're very concerned and upset that somebody would come and destroy this natural wonder that took millions of years to be formed,"" he told KUTV. In his 22 years on the job, he said he had not heard of any goblins rolling off their pedestals. Connection to Arias trial . All three have been booted from their Boy Scout leadership roles. The National Boy Scouts of America and the organization's Utah National Parks Council issued almost simultaneous and similar statements Monday addressing the men's actions. The local council statement said the former leaders violated the Scouts' principle of ""Leave no trace,"" which it said ""teaches the value of natural areas and the methods we can use to help protect and conserve these areas for future generations."" Meanwhile, the man who shot the video, Hall, is tied to another nationally publicized case: the Jodi Arias murder trial. Throughout the Arias trial, Hall appeared numerous times on HLN to talk about the life and legacy of his friend Travis Alexander and to paint an unflattering picture of his killer, Arias. CNN's Kyung Lah reported from Los Angeles; Tom Watkins from Atlanta.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- After 10 long hours in the sky, the Jang children couldn't wait to get off the plane. The Colorado siblings had just spent a month in Seoul, their first trip to South Korea. Their parents wanted them to get a taste of their heritage on their summer vacation. But their summer vacation will now be remembered for something entirely different. Joseph, Ester and Sarah were passengers on Asiana Airlines Flight 214 from Seoul to San Francisco. Flight attendants hailed as heroes . Seconds before landing Saturday, the Boeing 777 crashed onto a sea wall, severing its tail. The three were all near the back of the plane, which bore the brunt of the impact. ""During the time it was crashing, I thought it was all like a dream because I didn't know (if) it was actually happening,"" 13-year-old Joseph told CNN's Sara Sidner. ""We were all bouncing all over the place,"" 15-year-old Esther added. ""I just remember there being dust everywhere. I was freaking out, and then it just stopped."" The seats in front of them collapsed across their knees. Luggage and debris littered the cabin. ""After everything stopped and then I realized I was alive, I looked over and I saw my brother and sister. They were both fine,"" Esther said. ""And then I looked over at my mom and my dad, and they were both on the floor because their seats fell down."" Joseph tried calling out to his parents across the aisle. But he couldn't breathe.

So I was wondering if they were out of the plane, or still in the plane, 'cause after a while the plane started ... having a fire."" The family was separated for more than an hour. Did passengers ignore safety messages? ""When we all reunited ... I was really glad, so I started crying,"" Joseph said. The entire family was injured, but none seriously. The three children and their father are all recovering at San Francisco General Hospital. Joseph has a minor fracture in his back. Esther has a sprained foot and needs crutches.

"(CNN) -- When two important countries appear to be goading each other into a dangerous and meaningless war, it can be useful to take a deep breath, lay the rhetoric aside for a moment, and go back to basics. The past several weeks have seen a sharp increase in the three-decade war of words between the United States and Iran. Iran has held maneuvers in the critical Strait of Hormuz, combined with threats to interrupt commerce there. The United States has lost its third drone over Iran, and unnamed parties are conducting an unprecedented covert campaign of cyberwar and assassinations inside Iran. Iran says it has broken up a U.S. spy ring and has condemned a U.S. citizen to death. President Clinton launched U.S. sanctions against Iran's oil industry by executive order in the election year of 1995; at that time, Iran had not a single centrifuge turning. After a decade and a half of the United States and the international community's escalating sanctions, Iran has more than 8,000 centrifuges spinning and a substantial stock of low-enriched uranium. This is the very definition of a failed policy. The U.S. Congress in December passed a defense authorization bill that included provisions intended to bring down the Central Bank of Iran. Although President Obama expressed reservations, he signed it into law. This latest U.S. sanctions package is openly intended to deprive Iran of its oil revenues. By prohibiting other countries from dealing with Iran's banks, it is intended to prevent Iran from selling its oil. That is the equivalent of an act of war -- a financial blockade of Iran's oil ports that would deprive Iran of more than half its budgetary revenues. We should not be surprised that a country faced with economic warfare would remind the world that it, too, can create mischief. Iran cannot close the Strait of Hormuz for a prolonged period of time, but it is capable of impeding oil traffic out of the Persian Gulf for many months. The loss of its own oil exports would be the trigger for such action, which would drive up the price of oil to unforeseeable levels and risk a wider regional war. A war with Iran would not be surgical, brief, or one-sided. As memorably noted by Gen. Anthony Zinni, if you like Iraq and Afghanistan, you will love Iran. It is a huge country, well-defended, with a fierce sense of nationalism. No air campaign, even if prolonged, will end the problem. Regardless of how a conflict begins, it is most likely to end with lots of boots on the ground. A squad of special forces will not do the job. Paradoxically, the quickest way to insure that the Iranians decide to go for a bomb may be to bomb them. The most predictable result of a military strike would be Iran's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the ejection of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and cameras that watch every step of the Iranian enrichment process. Iran has a dreadful leadership. The surest way to rally the Iranian people around this corrupt and repressive system is for an external power to attack it. In the past few days, we have been reminded by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta that Iran has made no decision to actually build a nuclear weapon. At the same time, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while denouncing Iran's decision to proceed with its deep underground enrichment facility near Qom, has forcefully reiterated the U.S. call for Iran to return to the nuclear negotiating table. In the midst of all the saber-rattling and the clamor of an election year, what is there to talk about? A good place to begin would be the original U.S. offer to swap 20%-enriched fuel plates, to be used in Iran's research reactor, for Iranian enriched uranium. The fuel plates were originally a gift from the United States to be used in the production of medical isotopes. Iran tentatively agreed to such an offer in 2009, only to withdraw it in the face of domestic opposition. It later accepted the proposal in writing, guaranteed by Turkey and Brazil, only to have it rejected by the United States in 2010. Iran has since signaled its willingness to resume discussions without preconditions. U.S. policy has been one of pressure leading to negotiations. Iran has also pursued a dual-track policy of threats combined with offers of negotiation. These policies have resulted in the prospect of a war that would be disastrous to all. What we need right now is a crisis exit ramp. Perhaps this is the moment to explore the negotiating track that both sides say they prefer. Join CNN Opinion on  Facebook and follow updates on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- It won't surprise anyone that Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a scathing dissent in a Supreme Court case that came down last week. But it might surprise some people that three members of the court's so-called liberal wing joined him. Scalia argued that searching the car of Prado Navarette, pulled over on suspicion of drunken driving, violated the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor agreed. This seemingly idiosyncratic lineup is a developing bloc in Fourth Amendment cases, and it's one to keep any eye on as the court hears two even bigger such cases Tuesday. In Riley v. California and United States v. Wurie, the court will consider whether the police may search the contents of an arrestee's cell phone without a warrant. This means that if you get arrested for jaywalking or littering (and in some places, you can be), the police can search your smartphone -- and everything on it. There should be little doubt about what Scalia will say about these searches. He has become a regular champion of the Fourth Amendments protections against ""unreasonable searches and seizures."" In Navarette v. California, Scalia disagreed with the court's conclusion that the police could lawfully stop a car after a woman anonymously called 911 and reported that the car had driven her off the road. Scalia wrote that such stops were not the constitutional framers' concept of a ""people secure from unreasonable searches and seizures."" And in Maryland v. King, a case decided last term, Scalia disagreed with the court's conclusion that the police may lawfully take a cheek swab of someone's DNA after he or she has been arrested for a serious offense. He expressed ""doubt that the proud men who wrote the charter of our liberties would have been so eager to open their mouths for royal inspection."" Those proud men adopted the Fourth Amendment in large part to respond to the British use of ""general warrants."" These warrants were not specific about the people or items to be searched and thus gave the government broad discretion to search people's homes and the personal papers and effects within. The Fourth Amendment was adopted to ensure the American people would not be subject to such broad searches. As Scalia put it simply in the King case, ""suspicionless searches are never allowed if their principal end is ordinary crime-solving."" That's precisely why the police should not be able to search the modern-day equivalent of one's ""papers and effects"" -- the contents of one's cell phone -- without a warrant. Fortunately, there's reason to think that Scalia won't be on the losing side of this one. To start, searches of cell phones have the potential to be far more invasive than the searches in Navarette and King. In Navarette, the search was a brief traffic stop. Even the search in King -- a light swabbing of the cheek -- while more physically invasive, does not reveal all of a person's most private communications and the intimate details of one's life the way searches of a smart phone can. Consider all the information on your smartphone -- not only e-mails and texts and call logs, but also apps that reveal a tremendous amount about you. Moreover, King involved a booking procedure when an individual was taken into custody for a serious offense. Indeed, the court went to great lengths to emphasize that the search would only be imposed on individuals charged with serious crimes. Not so the searches at issue in Riley and Wurie, which could take place after any arrest. Further, unlike in Navarette and King, robust enforcement of the Fourth Amendment in these cases will not hamper law enforcement. In Navarette, a ruling against the government would have meant the police could not stop the car; in King, they could not have taken the cheek swab. Here, the police can still seize the cell phone at the time of arrest and, assuming there is probable cause, they can subsequently obtain a warrant to search the phone. Finally, the last time the court confronted a case involving a similar Fourth Amendment question -- another search following a lawful arrest -- Scalia was on the winning side: Justice Clarence Thomas also concluded that the search was unreasonable, and Justice Stephen Breyer suggested he might have if the Supreme Court had not already addressed the exact question at issue in that case. The court hasn't before confronted the question at issue in Riley and Wurie -- cell phone searches. But even though the question is new, it's one for which history provides an answer. The framers didn't want the government to rifle through people's most personal papers and effects in the absence of individualized suspicion that they might provide evidence of wrongdoing. As Scalia will surely recognize, and as all of his other colleagues should as well.","Brianne Gorod: Scalia champions Fourth Amendment, has sided with liberal wing .

She says framers wanted to protect against ""unreasonable searches and seizures""
